&gt; Hello all!
&gt; 
&gt; It looks like the Brosol 30-PICT-1 in my '64 is in need of a little TLC.
&gt; A couple of weekends ago I decided to fire up the Bus and adjust the
&gt; carb as it seemed to be running pretty rich per the plugs and the
&gt; tailpipe.  Well, after my tuning session, I noticed a film of fuel on
&gt; the sides of the carb near the throttle shaft, and also a bit on the
&gt; left side of the float bowl.
&gt; 
&gt; I'm not as worried about the float bowl leak; it appeared to be coming
&gt; from the air horn/body joint instead of the inlet tube.  When I put
&gt; a stubby screwdriver on the air horn screws they were 0.25 to 0.5 turn
&gt; loose, so that might explain that leak.  At this point I have to pull
&gt; the carb off the engine and send it to the Berryman Spa anyway, so if
&gt; there is a crack or some other problem up there I should find it then.
&gt; 
&gt; The throttle shaft leak seems to be coming from the throttle shaft -
&gt; the bolts that hold the carb to the manifold are tight.  I also tried
&gt; wiggling the throttle shaft (with the throttle closed) - it has maybe
&gt; 0.5 mm of axial play (left to right).  If I hold the shaft all the
&gt; way to the left or right with one hand and try to move the other end
&gt; radially (fore and aft) with the other hand, it also has some play
&gt; although about half as much.  I'm assuming this is the &quot;classic&quot;
&gt; symptom of worn throttle shaft bores.  I have no idea how long this
&gt; carb has been on the Bus; it seems odd to me that something that is
&gt; obviously a replacement carb would be worn in what I'm assuming to
&gt; be a relatively short period of time.  It could have been on the
&gt; Bus as long as ten years, though.
&gt; 
&gt; So: it looks like my carb needs the throttle shaft rebushed.  It
&gt; looks like Rimco can do this for $30; any feedback on them or advice 
&gt; on alternate vendors?  Is it worth it to do this to the Brosol carb,
&gt; or should I be looking for a gen-u-wine Fabrik im Deutschland Solex
&gt; replacement?  (I know you can't get those new.)  It seems that new
&gt; carbs only come in manual choke versions; is it possible to swap the
&gt; air horn (top) of my carb onto a new carb to retain the electric
&gt; choke?  Any other ideas?  The Bus has a 1500 SP out of a '68 Bug.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks!
&gt;
