Subject: Re: [VB] Battery suggestions?

&gt;I'm going to buy a new battery for my bus. Anyone have any suggestions on
&gt;what/where to buy? Anyone have any experience with those batteries with the
&gt;reserve switch that supplies enough power to start the engine in case you
&gt;accidentally drain it?
&gt;
&gt;Thanks,

Sam's Club sells the correct size (used to be called Group 42) for VWs.
You can tell by the sort size, the recessed terminals, and the plastic
cover for the positive terminal.  They have the best price I've seen.
