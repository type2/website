The size of your carb preheat hose should be 25mm diameter.  As for the
aforementioned metal tube that it connects to (on the underside of the
engine) don't be surprised if a PO lost it and its not there.  You will
probably see only the oval or round hole in the underside engine tin
where the metal tube would pass through, if you had one.  Mine was
missing and I had to go all the way to California to find a used one at
Interstate VW.

Note that there should also be a rubber sealing 'grommet' on the hole in
the sheet metal that the preheat hose passes through.  It seals the
space between the metal and the paper hose.  It's a hard item to find in
the usual catalogs, I finally found mine at Bus Boys.

&gt; What kind of hose should this be, paper or cloth bound rubber? What size is
&gt; it?
&gt; 
&gt; What is this hose actually for and what does it connect to after passing
&gt; below the sheet metal?
