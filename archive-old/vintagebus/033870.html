&lt;&lt; sounds like you have barndoor axles and reduction boxes
 bolted on a late trans,  &gt;&gt;

If so then they would obviously different looking and I would 
think that the person doing the install would see that.   You
can't bolt up a Barndoor to a later style suspension at all
w/o some major modifications.
