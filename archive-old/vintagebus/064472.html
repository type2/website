Subject: Re: [VB] Max RPM &amp; Cruisin rpm of a 1600 SP

Actually, I was wondering the same thing, and was going to ask my friend
tomorrow.  I'm getting my transmission rebuilt, and for gearing, I wanted to
tell the guy, ok, this speed(assuming that I had a stock tire size) at this
RPM, you can do the rest.  Anybody happen to know?  Thanks.

&gt; I have just been reading 'without guesswork'.
&gt; To quote from the performance section, the max &amp; cruising spped of a 1970
&gt; type II with a 1600 cc engine is 68 mph at 4100 rpm
&gt; It also says that the fuel consumption should be 26.4 miles per US gallon!
&gt; I guess that I can sort of fell happy going on the interstate _at_ 4000 RPMm
but
&gt; a lot of people sat 3500 RPM&gt;
&gt; What is the correct answer?
