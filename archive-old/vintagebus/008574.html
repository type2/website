while i'm waiting for the flex brake hose to come....

time to sort another problem...
recent thread has given me a foot up the but to do this.

on the '60, i have the pull knob for hte reserve fuel..... no cable, no bits
to do anything with yet...

but i also have a gauge -- did buses sometimes have both, i'd have thought
one or the other... spose it must be a change over year.

the wiring has all been replaced - after fire!

but no go with the gauge...
so, i've looked at the top of the sender and theres only one wire - fitted
to the terminal on centre of sender and running to the gauge.
&gt;from memory - i think there was another wire on my old bus? - and looking at
the wiring diagram in the book - it shows an earth.
but top of sender hasn't got another terminal - so i don't want to rely on
my memory, attatch a wire to the side of sender and kabooom :(

can someone tell me if i'm right? -- should the sender be earthed (to body
of bus)?   there is a very small pillar (prolly 2mm dia) towards the outer
edge of the sender, and it has 2 ridges moulded up of the cast (looking at
top of sender head in engine bay at about 5 o clock) - so maybe thats where
there should be another terminal?

any help appriciated

btw, the thread of leaky cap...  without petrol gauge i overfill the tank,
basically i guess how much petrol i need, often putting in too much, which
means petrol slops up the neck. and out through top...
