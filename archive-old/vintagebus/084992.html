&gt; Used my old washers too

hello Chris  something doesnt sound right here   were your old spacers the 
type with the inside opening two flat sides and the other part is round  or they 
like the VW spacers in that they are round all the way around  on the inside 
part . All of the porsche pulleys I have you have to get the center hub , the 
two halfs and the spacers   you can reuse the Vw outer cover and gen.nut.
