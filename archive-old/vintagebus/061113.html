Subject: Re: [VB] 67 Master Cylinder Reservoir?

An early Volvo resevoir will work too, the fill cap 
aligns better than the Wabbit cap. I've never seen a 
level swith in on of 'em. 

 Harry in Fresno
&gt; Probably, but you should be able to use the Rabbit reservoir as
&gt; Ray mentioned.  I put a bay-window dual-circuit MC on my '64 and
&gt; the Rabbit reservoir from the junkyard plugged right in.  As a
&gt; bonus, the cap on some of the Rabbit reservoirs has a float switch
&gt; that you can wire to an idiot light if you're so inclined.
