&gt;it has been sitting all winter. I try to start it, it cranks &amp; cranks, but
nothing. I spray a little starting fluid in the carb and it starts and run
for a few seconds before dying. &lt;
Did you drain the old gas out of the bus?  It is probably bad.  The PO may
be fibbing a little and even though it drove last fall for 10 minutes the
gas has been in there over a year.

I would recommend (again) while draining the gas to replace the fuel lines
and fuel filter (like $2).  Take the fuel pump off, from what you described
it is the Brazilian sealed non-rebuildable type, and clean by using a cup of
gas and a fuel line piece into the inlet tap to the fuel pump (inlet is the
bottom one) then use your finger to pump the bottom mechanism to create the
pumping.  You will probably see some junk come out of the top outlet and
from there you should be able to tell if the pump is strong.  By hand I
think you can get the fuel spray to go out about 4-6&quot; on the bus just
starter driven it should spray about a 12&quot;+.    Fuel pumps are pretty cheap
so if there is any question on its functionality just get a new one.

Check your carb.  I think the main problem here is a gummed up carb.  When
you press in the throttle lever on the carb can you hear the squishy sound
of the gas being released into the carb throat?  If there is no squishy the
carb needs rebuilt.  It is amazing how much crud is in the carb when it is
time to rebuild!  Also check out Richard Palmer's carb jetting article in
the type2 library.  Mikuni jets can be found at your local motorcycle shop
for cheap, I got my new main jet, 135 up from a stock 127.5, for $2.25 (much
cheaper than a VW place!).  All the rebuilding documents I have seen are
junk, just pay attention when tearing it down and you will be fine.

I am all talk on this one though :)  I am trying to get my carb to work
right now.  Exact same problem as you.  I know it is the stupid carb not
giving enough gas, but I cannot figure out why.... I rebuilt it two years
ago and set it up on a shelf and I think it corroded or something from
sitting so long.  Tonight I get to yank it off the motor and throw some
profanity at it...  It got a good dose of profanity last night as a warm-up
for tonight's onslaught :)  Now I need to be careful of draining the battery
too much and not getting a good crank.  Arrg!

Good Luck!,
