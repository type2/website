You should be able to get one from Johnney at Christmas Tree Island camp-out
on Friday night. I know they have a couple there for me and VW Howard and
I'm sure I can part with one or two for you, don't need it now it's only 110
degrees outside today, great bus temp test weather.

Subject: [VB] VTO Fire Pot


This is somewhat off topic but last Busses by the Bridge in Lake Havasu the
VTO bus group had a fire pot that they had lit on Sat. night.  Someone told
me that it was a fire pot for burning in the fruit groves to keep the fields
from freezing but that they were now outlawed for that use because of the
pollution that they put out.  It was about 6'feet tall and looked like it
could burn just about anything.  On my NQ Californication Buskatour '01 I
would like to locate one and bring it back to good old Nebraska.  If anybody
can help me on this quest please email me off list
Thanks
