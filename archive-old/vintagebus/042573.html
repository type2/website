&gt; As I have my barndoors floor mat out and it is unlikely I can find a decent

I have fixed several bus mats. they dont come apart again, and you cannot
tell they have been mended 9.9 times out of 10.

1) Go to the hardware store and buy a tube of Goop (they have several
different kinds but its all the same formula, get the regular kind i
think the tube is purple.)
2) Clean the mat really well.
3) put it upside down on a flat surface
4) fiddle with the crack until it is all lined up back together mating
properly (i usually put heavy weights on either side of the crack to hold
it together..)
5) fill each of those little square honeycomb holes about half full with
the stuff if no honeycombs, just lay a bead along the crack.
6) take yer finger and sort of smear the goop into the honeycomb, if no
honeycomb smear it back and forth along the crack to work it in, but dont
smear so hard that the crack re-separates or that you force the stuff out
the front...
7) let it dry overnight.
8) reinstall in bus, now a happy mat :)

take care,

Steve
