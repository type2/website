&gt; Warning, the plastic tubes are not plastic on the inside. The air temp
&gt; coming out of the heater boxes is high enough to melt most plastics. I 
&gt; know,
&gt; I've tried it. Use a flexible metal duct and wrap it with fiber-glass
&gt; insulation.

RMMW sells heat exchanger to body tubes for $22.75 or $19.95 depending on the 
yr/model.  Why try to reinvent the wheel when the part is available and 
probably can be had for less than RMMW prices if you look around?
