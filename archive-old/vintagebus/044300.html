Subject: New beds done for singlecab

Well I got the new bed. It's just sitting on the truck and I put the 
piece of the old bed on it so you can compare. 
http://www.centralia.wednet_dot_edu/lytle/mark2.html click on the '59 VW 
Singlecab Truck Link. Take a look and see what you think. I had mine 
made in two pieces front to back. I'm sure he can make them in four 
but there would be a lot more shrinking to do to form the ends. He 
had some problems handling the nine foot sheets of material and it 
took two days to make so the cost was alot higher than expected but I 
was glad to pay it to have a new bed! He left me excess material all 
the way around to wrap around the flange and trim to fit against the 
front. He also said the best way to attach it is to drill holes where 
the runners are below and weld the holes with my mig welder.
