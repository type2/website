Subject: [VB] Crappy oil pressure switches...

[...]

When my 1600 SP engine was rebuilt a couple of years back we went through 6
[six!] defective oil pressure senders before finally getting a good one
[number 7].

Every single one was a German part, new in the box.

&gt;&gt;  I put a NOS screw-terminal oil pressure switch in my Bus and now the
light comes on after driving on the freeway for a while.  The oil is fresh,
Bus just tuned and valves adjusted, dipstick is actually cool (for once),
drives normally.  Weird, I think I got a bum switch...  &lt;&lt;
