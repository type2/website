Friday contribution if I ever saw one :)

Me Too.

Actually a lot of the reason I switched from Type1's to Type2's is that I
can often go under the bus without jacking it at all!  To do simple things
like check the heat exchangers, do valves, and change oil (drain plug
access).

When I encountered a problem driving to Las Vegas a couple months ago, I had
to pull over and inspect the #4 exhaust port... let the engine cool for 10
minutes, then just slid under and looked at it (nut fell off, heat exchanger
J tube on head) and fixed it without having to use a jack :)

Of course, changing a tire without jack is a little more difficult :)

P.S.  Thom, hope it wasn't me who jumped in the bus :)  I know I could stand
to drop 30 pounds, but 4 inches of movement :)

Amen,
I am so paranoid about getting squashed I can barely change a tire, I've
spent
hours underneath the back end of my bus and I always use a floor jack with
two
jack stands under the frame, I'm still never really at ease, but at least I
can
concentrate on what I'm doing.
Another safety tip; if at all possible, have somebody with you.
I know there are emergencies and situations where we are working under less
than ideal conditions, but always keep safety at the top of your priority
list.
