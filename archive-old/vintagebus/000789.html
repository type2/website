 It was suggested that there were two types of restos. The quickie once over 
 for a profit using the cheapest items and the Saint who does it for a 
 keeper in spite of his soon to be ex-spouse. I agree with part of that 
 explanation with a comment and an addition.
 Comment:
 Quickie once over is not a &quot;resto&quot; it is a freshening of the vehicle. A 
 restoration is a meticulous return to factory quality. Not over done- but 
 to factory specs.

I though the two types of restos were getting it mechanically functional AKA 
good daily driver hopefully with window resealing done, 

and then actually redoing the inside and rust and bodywork/paint to make it 
look pretty.
