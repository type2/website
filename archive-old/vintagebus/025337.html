&gt; Just for future reference, how much are a set of original VW safari's in
&gt; decent shape going for nowadays?

My 2 cents is buy original.  They are worth the wait.  I have found very few
folks that were happy with the repro's.

Expect to pay from 3-500 for a complete set of original safari's that need a
TOTAL re-work.  That means repair and paint the frames.  Re-chrome the latches,
bases, sliders dash tab's and wing nut's.  New Rubber and Glass.  By the time
you are done, you will have upwards of $6-800 into them. (Fully restored)

The good thing about buying original frames is that you will have a very good
chance to get your money back should you sell them ever.  I don't think that
will happen with repro's.  Also, they ALL leak.  Even the German ones woth NOS
rubber.  If you live in a wet area, you will have H2O on teh florr every time it
rains.  In the sun, you can not beat them.  I will not own a bus w/o them.

My 2 cents.

PS.  If anyone needs new latch bases, i have them FS.

Matthew
