Subject: Anyone wanna sell an early bus IRS conversion kits?

Does anyone here have a Wolfgang IRS kit for a split window bus they'd like
to sell?  I've got a few parts that are worthy of trade but I'm looking to
buy without the price tag and this is why used is okay.  I like the
reduction boxes but I like the low maintenance and less potential for leaks
that you find on a IRS equipped machines.

I would like to hear both sides of the story about converting to IRS and not
WHEN USING a T4 2L engine.  I know Scott Fraser will have some comments to
make...anyone else?
