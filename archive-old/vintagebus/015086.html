Subject: 28PCI leakage and carb nomenclature
Date: Sun, 06 Feb 2000 22:21:10 -0700
Sender: dworkin_at_village_dot_org


A few days ago I asked about engine stumbling and getting a strong gas
odor through the stale-air heat system.  Well, I haven't quite tracked
down the stumbling yet for sure, but I'm pretty sure I've figured out
the gas odor.  Turns out my 28 PCI leaks at both end of the throttle
shaft, more so on the right than on the left.  Looks like it's time to
track down new seals/bushings/rebuild kit/whatever.  So much for
driving to work tomorrow....

Most VW carbs I've seen have been things like 30-PIC, 34-PICT, and
such.  This is the first one I've seen labelled PCI.  Can anyone
enlighten me as to the meaning of the various letters and their
ordering?

Thanks.
