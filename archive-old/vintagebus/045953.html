Subject: Install 3 window pop top Tips
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

I would love to hear from anyone that can give me any tips about installing a 
3 window pop top on a 67 camper. I have noticed that al the original staples 
are still in the wood. I have begunto remove them all. I am missing some 
triangular wood blocks that I will try to replicate. I have Dawns 
instructions and will go for it this week/weekend but I know there has to be 
some inside tips on making this more of an enjoyable experience. 

Thanks.
