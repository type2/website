Subject: Phoenix &quot;show/cruise etc&quot; on saturday!

I posted to the list the last time this &quot;show&quot; happened.... over 2000! vintage
cars showed up, and it gets larger every year. (only happens a couple times a
year)
It is not an official show, its a multi club event where everyone says &quot;meet
on central&quot;. The park central mall parking lot fills up and everyone *drives*
their vintage cars all over up and down central.
This event is well worth going to - assuming you like other vintage cars
besides VW's - and its free. Happens tommorow (sat) from 6pm to 10pm, park
central mall being the main place of action and you will see cars lining the
streets down central to camelback...you cant miss it.
(This is not a VW event but plenty of them show up, bring yours down!)
