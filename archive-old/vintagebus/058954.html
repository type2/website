Subject: FS: Original E-Z Camper Bed &amp; Jump Seat 

Hi Everyone,

	I've got to clean out the garage of some un-needed/un-wanted parts left
over from my recent camper interior resto.  ALL parts are original E-Z
Camper The upholstery will ONLY be sold as a SET:

1 - complete rear bed assembly w/ mech. two seat cushions and far back
cushion.  Includes the original bed mechanism and complete with the original
red embossed vinyl fabric with original wood backings. (they have PO made
covers over the original upholstery;  The original is still underneath and
appears to be in good shape!).

1 - complete set of jump seat cushions mounted on original wood back.

1 - set of rear arm rests with PO made covers covering the original red
upholstery.

1 - icebox liner with inner wire rack and ice tray.  In descent shape.

	I'm planning to be at the Red Barn BYOB this weekend so I can deliver to
that.  I'm skipping KP since it's just too much of a &quot;cluster&quot;.  I can
e-mail pics of everything if you need.  Just p-mail me at:
nate_at_nateswaterart_dot_com for photos.  Make a reasonable offer.  IT ALL MUST GO
NOW!!!!!
