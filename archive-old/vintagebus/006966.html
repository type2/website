I have a type 3 cooler on my bus, does cool better then a stock type 1
doghouse, I run a VDO temp switch in the boss(even though i don't use
gauges), the type 3 cooler has some extra aluminum plates on it that I bent
out to seal it (aka hoover bits), type 3 coolers have 30% more cooling fins
then stock type 1 coolers, all I did to clear the sender boss was cut 2
slits in the rear dog house part and bend the sheet metal up out of the way,
that way if I decide to go another way I can reweld the piece I cut back. I
have installed 3 temp sender units in my engine, I am going to install a
gauge! with a 3 way switch so I can tell the differences in oil temp taken
from different parts of the engine. 1.  dip stick sender (VDO) 2. pressure
relief screw sender (VDO) and the sender from the oil cooler (outlet side)
from this I should be able to tell where and how the oil is cooled, just
something to do. After I am done with this test I will remove the senders
and gauges. Maybe I'll install a type 4 after this and do the same thing,
(just to see how different the cooling is).

ps; was just getting ready to hook up the tach, but ended up selling it to a
duner/off roader for his $30,000 rail I built 3 years ago, and people
thought buses were pricey!!!

&gt; I recently got a little stash of parts from a friend of mine... included

&gt; of a short lived high performance engine that was in a type3.  I got the
&gt; heads, some tin, and the oil cooler.  I got the lower cylinder tin (aka
&gt; cool tin) and plan on giving this stuff a shot.
&gt; What would that oil cooler be from?  When/why/how was it used?

The oil cooler is the standard one from a t3 its the exact same size as a
doghouse cooler, some will argue that it cools better, but i have run one
and not really seen a difference.

Some things to watch out for:
If you run a t3 cooler upright AND put your oil pressure switch on the
cooler, its electrical lug will interfere with your rear motor flange... i
had to bend it to make it clear the front tin.

The thread on the cooler ISNT tapered, it takes a special oil pressure
switch at least on mine... it leaked like a sieve, so you might need a
copper crush washer on there, im not sure. At the very least use a dab of
loctite pipe thread sealant (white goop in a tube, blows that white tape
away by a large margin.  Great stuff)

You will have to cut up your doghouse shroud.  You will need a slot about
1 inch wide, 2 inches tall to clear the boss for the pressure
switch. (self explanatory when you try to put the shroud onto a t3 cooler
installed as upright. You'll see where the boss hits the sheetmetal.  get 
out the grinder.)

The pressure switch and Hoover bit are mutually exclusive, so you will
have to find some other way to seal around the bottom of the cooler where
the shroud ends.

So, with all that in mind, i'd say get a regular doghouse cooler. The
marginal cooling benefits that may come from using the t3 cooler are
offset (at least for me) by the additional fabrication and complexity
required by its use.

The ONLY way i'd ever use one again is if its all i had, or i was running
a t3 converted to upright where i hadnt drilled and tapped for an oil
pressure switch in the standard t1 location.

take care,

Steve
