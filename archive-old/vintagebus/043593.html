Subject: Re: [VB] New Internet GPS Tracking &amp; Security System

&gt;Immobiliser Inc. is introducing the world's first over-the-counter
&gt;wireless vehicle tracking and control system using the Internet and
&gt;Global Positioning System (GPS) technology.

There has to be some other communications channel too.  GPS is 
receive-only...it's easy for the box in your car to know where it is,
but for it to be able to tell someone else, it has to be able to
transmit.  It probably uses the cellular frequencies, making brief
&quot;phone calls&quot; to upload data.  It could be using something else though.

&gt;For example, parents on holiday in Europe could receive an alarm 
&gt;notification and shut down the operation of their car in Houston
&gt;if a child is out on a joyride in the family car.

And you can tell the difference, from Europe, that the car is being
taken on a joyride instead of being used to take someone to the
hospital?

I think this is a really bad idea.  IMHO, if it is possible to shut
down a vehicle fitted with this device via some Internet site, then
eventually, the site WILL be cracked into and cars will start shutting
off in the middle of traffic.  Or, an insecure local radio link to
the device could also be exploited.  I really don't like the idea of
giving a script kiddie control of my Bus at 60 mph on the highway...
