Another thing you'll need to check when you pull the motor is whether one of 
your retaining clips holding the throwout bearing came loose allowing the 
bearing to come unseated.

 Also,if you notice a bunch off small bearing rollers lying inside the bell 
housing you've got a bad gland not...did you grease it slightly when you 
replaced the clutch ....you did replace the clutch while you were in there 
didn't you.
