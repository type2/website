&gt; Does this mean that no matter what Type 1 engine size  I run (anything
from
&gt; a 1600DP up to a big old 2.2 litre), I'm condemned to overheating or will
&gt; the 1776 give me enough power gains to pull me out of this slump?  Even
&gt; though I like to cruise fast in the bus, I don't like running hot so I'm
&gt; half tempted to yank my flier and sell it and run the stock 67 trans.
&gt;


No, it doesn't. The higher gearing can be overcome with sufficient power.
The 2110 in Rosie runs downright cold. Oil temps rarely even get to 180 deg.
unless I'm driving 80mph. The engine was built with low compression, a big
sump and the Porsche generator pulley. I can't say if a 1776 will give
enough power, but the specifics of compression ratio, carburetion and fuel
mixture all have a very large effect on the operating temp of the engine.
