&gt;    Welding up cast iron is not recommended in my book. I have a RGB trans in
&gt; my shop (today) that I just had to replace both axle tubes and RGB's due to 
&gt; the PO trying to weld the RGB to the axle housing. What happens is the weld 
&gt; is a different alloy then the iron and it cracked just inside the weld. 
&gt; It's like trying to weld a exhaust manifold in a water pumper it's a band 
&gt; aid on the real problem.

Hi Ronnie,
Fortunitly the RGB, brake drums, and front suspension parts are not made of 
iron which has a high content of carbon in it making it hard and brittle!  
They are made of quality cast steel, which is far more malible than cast 
iron.  Try pounding on a cylinder sometime and see how it snap, crackle, pops 
into pieces!  As for the cracked weld it sounds like someone did not get 
enough penetration due to running the welder too cold.

 Best to find an oversize insert and go that way. I have &gt; NEVER had a problem 
&gt; with a HeilCoil in a RGB and I have used them all, Time Serts, heil coils 
&gt; and oversize inserts (like case savers). It's all in the installation, Do 
&gt; it right it works, screw up and you'll have problems in the future. As far 
&gt; as welding a nut on the RGB plug again shows a lack of confidence in your 
&gt; work or the parts you're using. Most VW RGB's have gone 100,000 plus miles 
&gt; before a rebuild, do you really think you'll drive it that much to do all 
&gt; the extra work for a just in case!

Well Eric has had to deal with hundreds of bad/ruined Heli-Coils.  When you 
have a whole fleet of USAF C-130 Hercules cargo aircraft and a couple of 
thousand flight line workers messing them up......   The problem with 
Heli-Coils is that they can not be locked in place.  This allow Heli-Coils to 
be screwed in more by the bolt you are trying to tighten or come out with the 
bolt making a nasty balled up mess of Heli-Coil.  
  Most sold inserts including Time-Sert come with a locking device built in 
them and any other without locks can be locked with a drill bit and pin.
  As for the 100,000 miles between RGB rebuilds we have put on at least 
20,000 miles per year for over ten years just on our 1960 walk thru panel 
camper conversion.  This means we pass the 100,000 mile mark about 4 to 5 
years.  Plus a few years ago we did have our first freeway flier prototype 
tranny started to pop out of gears.  Turns out it just needed a simple 
internal adjustment fix, but needed removal and complete dissassembly after 
only 50,000 miles.  It was so nice to be able to just thread in a bolt and 
remove the RGB plugs with the claw hammer!

&gt; Ronnie,  try to do it right the first time
&gt; 
&gt; ps; To seal the plug right I always scotch bright the outside of the plug 
&gt; and the inside of the hole on the RGB. I then put a thin coat of High temp 
&gt; black RTV silicon on both areas before pressing the plug back in.  Be 
&gt; careful on removal as that when most problems occur, i.e.; tweaking the 
&gt; plug. 

When we seal the plug and RGB to the swing plate this seals out water and 
rust that can and will cause the metal plug to get stuck when removing due to 
a ridge of rust in the bore.
