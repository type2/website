Here's a link of another singlecab with those vents.  I could be wrong, but
I think that is an Australian Type 2. I saw a picture of one somewhere that
said this was only done in Australia (maybe it was Brazil?!? d*amnit, I
forget). Maybe someone else could shed some light on this.

&gt; Oh trusted listees, can any of you tell me about the extra louvers on this
&gt; truck?
&gt;
&gt; http://www.brubakerbox_dot_com/temp/67sc.jpg
&gt;
&gt; I found it in upstate NY yesterday. All the usual rot plus the frame had
&gt; been sectioned at some time (poor job). The main bed is good and that is
&gt; about it other than the little bits and pieces that you could part out.
&gt; Definitely not worth the $1500.00 asking price even though it has a
running
&gt; 1600 dp in it.
&gt;
&gt; I wanted to place it in the registry but the photo of the M-Code plate did
&gt; not come out and I didn't write it down. I'll be going that way again this
&gt; weekend and try to get the numbers again.
