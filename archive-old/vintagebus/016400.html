Are you hinting that you finally sold the
barnambulater?/

Nope! The bus is still for sale at this moment. Have
been dancing with several folks who want it but won't
quite step up to the bar. I have no fear that it will
go to the right home. Some of the cool extras were
peddled off at dime on the dollar bargains at/prior to
the Prescott,AZ show. We are now down to the bus it's
self.
I have a feeling that I will be hoofing it to the
OCTO/Classic and putting it in the barndoor line up.
