For so long I have avoided investing in any kind of sand blasting
equipment.  For the most part it had to do with the fact that I was
dealing with old vehicles.  Also...I'm cheap!
Recently tho, a friend has purchased a large cabinet (large enough to do
full sized bumpers) and I plan on going up there weekends to use it and
see what happens.
I also have a brother who works in a shipyard...they have a cabinet that
has a rotating assembly the part is placed onto...I can do an entire wheel
in 2 minutes on that equipment and the results are perfect.  I'd do more
at my brothers work site...but I don't think the owner would get off on
it.
I think one of the concerns is the breathing of the dust...
What equipment do you use to protect yourself?

&gt; I went to this site last night from someones message onlist, its a neat site
&gt; and worth a read, but it has plans for making a sandblasting unit that seem
&gt; simple cheap and looks like it would would work a treat. Save $'s bigtime
&gt; and do it yourself
