Just wanted to update you all on the progress of the new shop.

The city codes dictated that if I built a 30 x 40 shop, I would have to do 2
things.  First off, the 8 x 12 utility shed I built would &quot;have to go&quot; as
you are limited to a total of 2 out-buildings with a combined total of no
more than 1200 square feet.  Second, any out-building that exceeds 1000
square feet must be double layered with sheetrock because as they put it,
&quot;It's a torch waiting to burn.&quot;  This of course doesn't factor in that 1200
square feet between 2 buildings can actually hold more than 1 building
totaling 1200 squre feet but I digress.  The resultant beefed up foundation
and sheetrock pricing would more than double the cost I had budgeted for the
building.

So the shop space was put down to a palsy 30 x 32 which in this area and to
me is still a rather good size.  It beats the 12 x 18 I have now by a long
shot.  Even the loan officer said, &quot;That's a pretty good size shop.&quot;  At
least I still get to keep my 8 x 12 shed and pack it full of yet more crap.

After handing in some AutoCAD drawing that my brother and I drew up, I went
down, impressed the hell out of the inspector (because us po' folk in dem
dar VDubs jist dudn't do dat torta ting.) I finally got the buidling permit
last Friday, I got the $5K loan today, and the contractor that is supposed
to drill my holes told me at work today, &quot;Just let me know when you want
them drilled.&quot;  There will be 13 holes dug 12 inches across and 42 inches
deep.

I want to set up the webcam to film this but I have a paltry 6 foot cord.  I
need about 10 to 12 feet to reach the best view out of the window so does
anyone know if a USB extension cord exists and if this will work for USB
applications?

Thanks for reading.
