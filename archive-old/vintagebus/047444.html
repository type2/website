Steven,

I'm just down the road from you here in Olympia, WA.  I specialize
in rebuilding stock and high performance VW transaxles and may
have what you need on the shelf.   If you have any questions please
feel free to post me a note.   Should you elect to go the mail order
route with the Calf. companies I have had good reports from people
who have purchased from Rancho.
