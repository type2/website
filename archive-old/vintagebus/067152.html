Subject: Re: [VB] Switches for a '67

Hi Greg&amp;Dan,
Check out he type2_dot_com library for headlight switch cleaning/solder to 
prevent voltage drop which might also help you fix the one you have.  If not, 
it is a great help to prevent what you experienced already with any new used 
headlight switch you get as a replacement.
  As for the turn signal switch if it otherwise works fine try applying a 
couple of layers of electrical tape around the column and remount the switch!
