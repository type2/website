&gt;I haven't seen the [Berg] book of tech articles, what's it like?

It's paperback, 8.5x11, 82 pages, with 12 articles as follows:

Cam Sense                            9 pages
Compression vs. Octane               5 pages
Cooling the Air Cooled Engine        6 pages
Deck Height                          3 pages
Gearing                              9 pages (6 are graphs)
Heads                               13 pages
Pistons and Cylinders                5 pages
Rod Angle                            2 pages
Stroking                             4 pages
Suspension                           9 pages
Transaxle Building for Performance  12 pages
Valve Springs                        4 pages

The Berg part number is GB-801.  They also have a &quot;Book of Instructions&quot;,
GB-800, which is the instructions for most of the parts and kits that
they sell.  It's the same format but about twice as many pages.

I think the &quot;technical articles&quot; book is pretty good.  Of course, it talks
up the parts that Berg sells, but most of the time it does explain why Gene
thought his parts are better than the stock ones.

The &quot;instructions book&quot; is much more specific to each part and isn't
a good general technical reference, but there are some good tips and
hints lurking here and there.
