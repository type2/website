Subject: Re: [VB] shipping deluxe trim

Once again, I highly recommend against rolling it up. If the piece already
has its right angle bend, then consider shipping it flat in an
appropriately large flat box, that you can make up yourself from a
refrigerator shipping box that you find behind a store that sells them,
etc.

It will be very light, and won't cost much. Or, wait til Kelly Park - 6
weeks.
