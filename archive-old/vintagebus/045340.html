Subject: Re: Tach hook up question
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

 Now that I've got the Rancho Freeway Flyer in my 66 Westy, I'd like to check 
my RPMs at speed.  Last yr. at a swap meet I bought a VDO tach (3 1/2&quot; dia) 
that appears to be unused (wire ends look unmolested).  My question is can 
anyone tell me what the wiring set up is as I don't have instructions.  The 
wires are as follows:    2 large ones - Blue and White    and 3 smaller wires 
- Red, Green, and Black.     Thanks in advance for the help...
