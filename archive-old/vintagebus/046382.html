Hi Clara,
This is unfortunitly probably true, but if it reduces the amount of water 
getting into the bus it hopefully will last longer against the rust.  Also we 
are wondering if during the winter wet months up here, if tar would even seal 
the window frame to the outer seal better than duct tape.  The plus side of 
this is that the tar cleans up easily with kerosene or other orange product 
degreasers and does not look as bad as duct tape on the outside.   Eric&amp;Barb

if you use R.T. to seal the safaris shut for the winter, it would be good to 
heat it up w/ a hair dryer before opening in spring, as cold tar can rip 
seals, and you dont want that.   It can stain paint though, at least fresh 
paint.      I clean tar up w/ WD-40.   The problem is also those wet summer 
months, today being a fine example.

Clara
