Subject: hot springs trip report

Hey guys   This was the trip from hell   started out on sat cause it rained 
all nite fri. everything was going good till we tried to go thur Bristol Tenn 
on Sat morning  Nascar was there and not going anywhere after sitting in trafic 
for an hour we turned around and went the longer way around that mess( note 
to self check where Nascar is and go other way fast )   no problem just longer 
start down I 181  get to Sams gap damn now its snowing ,good 3 inches  miss 
the first turn but that was probably a good thing as it was a real small road, 
finally get to Hot Springs  raining nasty  campground not real nice , wife 
(Sandra) not happy feet wet all the other ladies left We pulled in and watched 
Dicko and Lori leave   no TV wanted to watch the basketball games,  So we pack up 
and head to Asheville hoping to catch a motel. first 5 stops no go Nascar was 
staying here also.  Get on I40 east winds 60mph blowing us all over the place 
fine a Days Inn out in Marion near Nebo where Troy Wical lived when I towed 
him back to my shop.  Started to watch the games but was way too tired . All of 
a sudden there was a big BOOM outside   Looked out and the bottom part of the 
Days Inn sigh had fell hitting the parking lot about 50 feet from my van.  
WOW the wind had to be 65-75 mph  unreal.  All four section came down about 70 
feet in the air made some real noise.  Did not sleep too well that nite  got up 
in the morning and got on rt 221N heading for boone so we wouldnt have to 
fight the wind and trucks on I 40  nice road till you get to Grandfathers 
Mountain  . I really didnt like the look of that road real narrow and looked like a 
tunnel but that was the way we were headind so on we went.  Looking later I saw 
that Grandfathers Mt, was just under 6000 ft   Snowed there the nite before 
at the top and down the other side road turns into a solid sheet of ice. Man 
now this was bad  went on going very slow and careful  wife was freaking out and 
had just started if you know what I mean .  took forever but we made it to 
boone  got something to eat and choose to take rt 421 to I77 and up fancy gap  
Winds still blowing 60 mph real scary again as the gusts would make the van 
change lanes and you never knew which direction it was going to do it.  Got to 
I77 and up fancy gap real slow but Ok  At the top started to loose power and 
couldnt tell if it was the 60mph headwind or trouble with the van , Had to get on 
the shoulder and run but real slow, no odd noises from engine so determined 
it must either be a fuel problem or Cat Convertor clogging up. Finally clears 
it self up and away we went. Gas gage was showing low so we stopped for gas 
only to have the power off at the next 3 exits so no gas pumps working , keep on 
driving till we are really low on gas and find a gas station that worked.  
Finally make it home safe and half sound real tired , needing a drink real bad 
and wife who wasnt very happy. It will probably be a cold day in hell before I 
can get the wife to do this again  LOL    . After a weekend of rain, snow , 
crappy campground that charged $30.00 per nite, sleet, iced roads, and hurricane 
force winds the vanagon did good except for that one time of power loss .  Did 
like the town of Hot Springs it was cool  later and have fun   Mark Dearing
