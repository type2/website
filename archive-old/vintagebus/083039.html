Subject: Re: [VB] poor milage

Ronnie said:


 my daily driver panel has a new(aprox 1200 miles) 1600 sp in it that's only getting 15 mpg mixed use(about
1/2 and 1/2). i'm running a new 30-pict 1 and a stock used 69 bus distributor, which were both on the previous
1600 sp engine installed in the bus last summer. with that engine i got 19-20 mpg mixed use running that exact
same carb and distributor, and this was in the summer with the safari's open full tilt.
my rings haven't seated yet, because it'll still chug slowly down my
driveway(steep grade) when i get out to lock the gate with the bus in gear. could this be bringing my milage
down?

Back in the mid to late 60's, I used build Chevy V8's for street and strip [drag strip] in New Jersey. Mainly
283's. You could build two identical engines: same bore, same stroke, same 10/10 crank, same compression
ratio, same cam, same heads, same carb, etc.  One would run like a rocket and the other would be a dog. We
could never explain it.

You may have too little piston clearance, you may have bearings on the tight end of the clearance range.

It is sorta the same today with new cars. You can have 2 new Mercedes, identical off the showroom floor. One
gets better mileage than the other.
That's why they say 'Your mileage may vary'.  :)

Even though you are comparing apples to apples, some may have a worm in it.
