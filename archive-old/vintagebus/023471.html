Although it really helps preserve the VWs paint to have a greasy engine room, 
I prefer a clean one, cause I don't get grease in my hair, and stay 
reletively clean after a tune up or engine pull.

What I have done is liberally douse the engine compartment with simple green. 
 get around the front of the fan shroud, and even spray it into the fan.  
also underneath, around the crank pulley, up into the fins, inside of the 
engine lid, etc al.  couple hours later take it to the self swerve car wash 
wearinging your grubbies, and maybe a hat,  prop open the engine lid, leave 
it running,  take your glasses off if you wear them, and give it a good hose 
down.   Do point that pressure hose up into the fins.    AVoid the 
distributor, getting it soggy will stall out the motor, and you will have to 
find something dry to clean the cap out with and wait for the ambient 
moisture to disperse.  After you are done, you will see all the areas you 
missed, but it'll be better.  I switched to Simple Green from the cans of 
shiny engine bright after I found it worked just as well, but smells better.

if it is really badly caked, you'ld want to pull it down to a long block.   I 
know someone who bought a bug on Orcas Island, which has many dirt roads, 
even driving slow it can't take you much more than 30 miutes to get anywhere. 
 and there is no place to drive real fast.   That bug had a oil leak, and had 
no fins left.  they had been covered with oil mud dust until the motor was a 
blob.  He could see that from looking up at the fins, so pulled that down to 
a longbloack and took it to the car wash so it could handle mainland life and 
freeways.

 I've pulled apart engines with 1/4&quot;+ of caked on dirt on the fan and fins. 
Not much heat getting through that muck I suspect. Recently pulled a 914 
engine apart with huge amounts of leaves and pine needles aroung the cyls and 
heads, but that was caused by horizontal air intakes and parking under trees. 
 
 My DC has a film of oil and dirt in the engine room, and on the engine 
because everything goes through the engine. I suspect an unhealthy habit of 
downshifting for engine braking on my part, but that's not the question. 
 
 So the question is... can the engine be cleaned with adegreaser like Simple 
Green without pulling it apart? Would spraying a mist at the fan when the 
engine is warm cause a problem? 100% humidity doesn't kill engines in rainy 
weather. Pressure wash from below?That would send the gunk up to fallback 
down again. Guess I'll have to doa little study on thisbyrecording oil 
tempsbefore and after,but thought the list may know some tricks.
