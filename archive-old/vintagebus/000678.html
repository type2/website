&lt;&lt; Face it; the only parts most of us buy new are resto bits, like
 repro rubber.  Now that the CalLook craze has died, with only a few
 holdouts here and there who were too young (and romanticise about the
 Disco Era because they didn't suffer thru it) and missed it all back in 
 1985 (or who refuse to believe the world has moved on), the market for
 &quot;engine dress up kits&quot; and clear distributor caps has dried up.  My
 local VW FLAPS can't give the stuff away.
 
 In step the A2/A3 chassis vendors, with rice boy exhausts, body fiberglass
 kits, engine hop-up kits, yada yada yada who have marketing and 
 advertising budgets to get their stuff in front of the kids in the
 new beeters.
 
 It's just good business.
 
 Now, for a type-only mag to survive, it has to have income.  Printing
 all those cool glossy centefolds of NOS ribbed (for his pleasure!) 
 bumpers costs money.  That money has to come from advertisers or
 subscribers.

Thom,
I certainly agree with your thoughts on type-only magazines. Its very evident 
on this list daily as owners talk about picking up used parts at auctions and 
swaps...overall a thrifty group :-)

The CalLook may be dead out your way, but it is very much alive in the East. 
I think its brought about by those wanting something different then a new 
beetle, yet at the same time having the &quot;cool&quot; factor. 

I always get a kick about the negative references to the new VW. I know a lot 
of owners of &quot;old&quot; VW who also own the new beetle. We have to remember that 
our &quot;old&quot; VW's were at one time new and that in 30yrs the new one will be the 
old timer
 :-)
