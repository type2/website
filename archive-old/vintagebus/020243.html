&gt; what does a 911 do to cool itself- n how is the concept different that the 
&gt; old VW?

The basic principle is the same: a single belt off the crank pulley, which
spins a fan (and alternator), which blows air down on top of the cylinders and also thru 
an oil cooler (except the 3.6L and some of the monster race engines, where there
wasn't room).  Air is also ducted thru tubes on the side to the heater boxes -
the paper hoses just like on a VW - and into heater boxes and then into the heater 
channels just like a bug.  The difference in the heater boxes on a 911 is
since all 6 exhaust ports come out in a row on the bottom, the heater box
can take advantage of all of 6 of them - not just 2 like on a VW.  The heat on
a 911 will melt your tennies - it can be physically painful to hold your feet
near the outlets.

There was a flat-fan option for the 934, which looked a lot like the Corvair
fan, and was positioned flat across the top of the engine, but was gear driven 
as opposed to that twisted belt mostrosity.  These can be retrofitted to a 
normal 911, but a complete used setup will run you $7k to $10k.  They flow an
ungodly amount of air though, the exact CFM escapes me, but is listed in 
the &quot;911 Performance Handbook&quot;

The oil cooler on a 911 is parallel to the cylinders, ala type4, so it's not
in the way of any particular cylinder like pre-doghouse VW's.  FWIW, the 911
cooling system was virtually unchanged from '64 (prototypes) thru the end of 
the air-cooled era, with the exception of changing fan styles and the moving of
the oil cooler off of the engine in the 3.6L.  Starting in the early 70's
with the S models, and eventually all 911s, an auxiliary cooler was located in
the front right fender.   The 911 engine has 2 oil pumps, one for the sump
and one for the bearings.  And you guage freaks would love a 911 - you have a 
guage for oil *level* (ie how much), oil temperature, and oil pressure.  If
you were really AR I guess you could add one for &quot;taste&quot;.  The 911 oil
system is dry-sump, with an oil tank separate from the crankcase.  In my '77,
to *completely* change the oil, like when I switched to synthetic (and
subsequently *back* once I found it leaked like a seive with synth) took
about 15 or so quarts of oil, once I drained the tank (8qt) sump (3-4qt),
cooler and lines.  _at_ almost $5 qt for Mobil 1, that's an investment!
 
&gt; any one else seen that early KDF case- the one without the oil cooler?   I 
&gt; guess just fins weren't enough.    

Eeek!  The early ones also had fewer thru-bolts on the case, and would literally
blow themselves apart.  The early cars also didn't have the frontmost and rearmost
body-to-pan bolts, so the front and rear of the car &quot;floated&quot; on the pan.
