Subject: Max RPM's updated (can't count)
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com, type2_at_type2_dot_com ('type2_at_type2_dot_com')

I have a 1600 SP in the 70 pop_top Westy and a 40 horse in the 63 singlecab.

I sorta redline the 1600 a 4000 RPM (72 MPH with standard tyres)
18 mph/1000 rpm I read on the list.
Correlates with the owners manual saying that 65 is cruising speed &amp; Max 
speed.
I have not installed the tach in the singlecab but it has a big nut tranny, 
and 205*15 tyres. So I guess that I can probably drive at 60-65.

But the question is, 
Some people say that 3500 RPM is a good Max
I infer from the book that 4000 RPM is Max
Others have said that 4500 RPM is Max

What is the answer?
