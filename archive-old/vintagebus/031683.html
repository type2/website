We have been working our tails off to get bumpers made and should have a
load of Repo Fiberglass pressed bumpers at Red Barn and KP?. Fronts, rears
and truck rears. If you want one please let me know before hand so I can
save/have it there for you.

thanks   ronnie   old volks of az

rpfnos      re pop from new old stock 

the molds were made off of NOS bumpers, so does that qualify use of the term
NOS  &lt;:~)
