Used speedos are not that hard to come by.   I had the exact problem
with the speedo in my '56 a few years ago.  I put a few drops of thin
oil in the back of the speedo, and a few more down the cable, and it
worked like a champ until I sold the car; it's probably still working
great, tooling around the AZ desert.

&gt; Does anyone have pictures of the inside of 65 bus speedo. On our trip
&gt; just before we got back to dallas the speedo started howling and
&gt; flipping around and then quit. The odometer still works so it must be in
&gt; the speedo. Also does anyone know if there are any kind of aftermarket
&gt; speedos. Maybe something with combined guages to keep track of things.
&gt; Right now I have my guages mounted in the package tray so I wouldn't
&gt; have to cut holes in the dash, but they are not very visible.
