This is one of my favorite threads!

You're correct - *nobody* out there is restoring buses to concours
standards.  Some guys are doing a damn nice job, like the stuff
I've seen Lenny Copp put out, but if you'd ever been to a Porsche
concours (the only type I've ever been to) you'd see we're on a 
totally different planet.  Some of these guys spent more for wax
than we've spent for our cars.

Like I've said before, the bus owner demographic isn't particularly
suited to concours-type events.  Most bus bus people are poor, or
at least poor compared to the 7 and 8 figure income crowd that's into
the concours thing.  Another contributing factor is the &quot;tradition&quot; of
VW buses is not conducive to hermetically sealed restoration.  Too
many people want to drive their cars, and as such are hesitant
to dump scads of cash into them to make them into trailer queens.
Yes, there's a lot of trailer queens out there, but not as many 
percentage-wise as compared to the early porsches!

Can you imagine a Pebble Beach bus concours?  All these super-clean
detailed buses, with their scruff, scraggly, (and sometimes smelly)
owners milling about?

Well, it's not going to happen any time soon.  The market isn't there
yet for super nice, super-correct restos. Sure, there will be onesey
twosey jobs here and there, but they're the exception rather than the
norm.

I wish I had the attention to detail, and patience, to do a *real*
restoration.  Every time I do something on the '60, I find another
spot on the car where I think &quot;I really could have done that
better&quot; or &quot;Wow!  I can't believe I missed that!&quot;  Oh well.  I can
drive it, and it looks pretty from a distance, and women
aren't afraid to sit in it..  An OK compromise by me.
