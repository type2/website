One day when I *needed* to have this done (long story) I put my '67 up on 
a jackstand (just the side of the stuck drum) and, having left the tire 
lugged to the drum,  proceeded to beat the living h*ll out of the back of 
the tire with a 3 pound hammer.

I started off by either beating the tire rubber and/or using a block of 
wood between the hammer and the rim, but by the end of an hour or so of 
that, I abandoned both and just beat on the rim.

I'm not sure if my tire can be rebalanced, but the damn drum came off.  I 
was pretty tired by the end though.  Exhausted is actually a better word.

So, obviously this is a sub-optimal sol'n, but it might work in a pinch if 
you're on the side of the road.

i am, of course, open to other suggestions...
