international exchange rate is roughly 1.5 actually a little more.  I paid 
around 575 for my primered kit.  The pounds were 295 + 66.30 for carriage 
(shipping)

So far I have the tabs in as of today and have been test fitting.  I like the 
fit except that the frames at the bottom seem a little tweaked but hopefully 
after paint, rubber and glass that will correct.  Got the tops perfect 
though.  Had problems with the middle tab but thats about it.  The rubber is 
super nice as are the latches and glass.

Looking foreward to cruising with them this spring.
