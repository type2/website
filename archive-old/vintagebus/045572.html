Muir had some eccentric ideas, and quite a few people disagree with
him on the issues of automatic chokes and centrifugal distributors.

As long as the choke is adjusted correctly, it shouldn't cause any
problems.  The carb has a diaphragm designed to open the choke pretty
quickly after engine startup.

I agree- leave the choke in working order.  It is there for a purpose.
Remember that Muir lived in the desert SW, where warm up isn't as much of an
issue.  in most places the choke is really useful.
