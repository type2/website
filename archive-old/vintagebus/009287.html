This message is being posted to the vintagebus and vintagvw listserves
because it involved engine/electrical stuff that is common to both vehicles.

Tonight I decided to let the old bus have a rest and took the 74 Super to
Lincoln, NE.  The battery was low from letting the bus sit for couple of
months so I pushed it around front and hooked it up to the charger.  I also
noticed that my front wheel bearings loose so I jacked it up, pulled the
wheels, popped the dustcaps and snugged things up.  The driver's side
bearing needed some grease so I took care of that and put everything back
together and we were off.

Everything was fine with oil temps around 180 to 190 the whole time  I went
and looked at a 64 Notchback that is for sale there, stopped and saw my
buddy Frank Musil, and headed back home.  On the way home the Alt. light
reared it's ugly head.  It would come on, go off at irregular intervals and
then on the highway while doing 65, the light would come and the gas guage
would from 1/4 tank down into the reserve area.  For about 10 miles it was
like this and then bam, all of a sudden the alt light went out, gas guage
returned to normal, and all was fine for 10 miles.  Once I slowed down, it
came on and off again for the last 5 miles.

I've had problems with Li'l Red's electricals ever since he came into my
life.  It started with an alt light on all the time which culminated in a
rebuilt alt and regulator being put it.  That was in August of 1997.  Then
I've been plauged with hard starts the past 2 years where the alt and oil
lights are dim when you crank it over and the starter goes
&quot;RRRRRRRRrrrrrrrrrrRRRRRrRrrRRRRRRr&quot; (you get the idea).  The bug will start
and run fine all day but you let it sit over night and you're back to the
same situation with hard starts.  If I put the battery on the charger for 15
minutes, it gives it new life and L'il Red fires right up.  I've also been
plagued with a pulsating electrical system which is embarassing at night -
you can see the headlights throbbing and the dash lights doing the same.

I'm taking a guess here but wouldn't the logical way to start be replacing
the regulator followed by the alternator?  Where is the best place to test
alternator output voltage?

Thanks for the assistance - I want this electrical problem fixed!!!
