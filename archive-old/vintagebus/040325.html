Subject:  Drive it or check it?  was beam me up...

Things are pretty slow at work this
week 8-)..... makes a pleasant change..

Anyway, in the beam thread I felt the presence
of a sub thread which was Clara's 'grease it
and drive it' view vs the 'pull it apart'
view (which would be my own way of doing things).

And I would like to just define what I see as
the difference between the two approaches.
Many of the buses I see in Oz now are coming
out of paddocks and off farms and the like.  Those who
want a bus now are usually more likely to 
pick up something the has been sitting outside
for ten years, or at best covered but unused for 
ten years....

The 'new' barns (and there's not many) being found 
here are often literally dug out of the ground.....

Now the front ends on these buses are all stuffed.
You pull them apart and the link pins and bearings
are just a rusty congealed mass.

So, I guess the point I'm trying to  make is that
how you treat a bus largely depends on its history
(what climate its been in) and how you judge its general mechanical
condition.
A barny, if recently driven or greased and stored
dry would be fine with a grease and drive. 
However, to me, a bus with seized trailing arms suggests
that things should be checked out.  I'd be interested
to get thom's report on his king and link pins........

So what am I saying?  There is no golden rule, make your call
on the information you have before you....
