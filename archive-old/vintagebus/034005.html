Hi Aaron,
We definitely do not know about electronics as well as we would like to, but 
we also have run a 6 volt bus fuel gauge and sender on a 12 volt system with 
no problems and very accurately.  The only thing that did go worng a year 
later was that the ground wire for the sender loosened while driving which 
caused the gauge needle to violently jump back and forth which very quickly 
broke off the white plastic needle!   Eric_at_Barb
