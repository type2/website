&gt;&gt;Stephen does understand that that would indisputably violate copyright
law. He is also aware that it would break the promise we make in writing to
each new subscriber of each list, that we will not republish or sell your
messages because you own your words, we don't.
&gt;&gt;
However, despite repeated attempts, I have not been able to get from him a
commitment that he will not distribute the archives on hard media.
&gt;&gt;
If it truly violates copyright law, forget the distribution plans and put
the web site back up.  Problem solved.

Based on what you said, I don't see how the archives itself is not a
republishing of the messages.  The way I see it is that when I post a
message, it is published to every subscriber.  If they retrieve it again via
the archives, they are having that message republished to them.  Since I own
my messages, can I ask that they be removed from the archive and all future
messages from me not be archived?  That would be ridiculous.

Or... Send them to me, I need another gigabyte of data on my site anyway.
