Subject: BBBIV Report

&gt; Just wanted to let Ronnie and Jon and Rachel, etc. know that the Utah Guys
&gt; made it back to SLC from Lake Havasu Monday evening in spite of an engine
&gt; semi-meltdown! 
&gt; 
&gt; Once again we had a great time and enjoyed getting together w/ the many
&gt; listees and others in attendance.  I posted some of the more interesting jpegs
&gt; on The Planet.  Look for you or your bus, family, etc. under BBB 2002.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks again to Ronnie for letting us use his Shop outside area for retorquing
&gt; the heads on the 60 DC which allowed us to make it home without pulling the
&gt; engine.  Only used 3 quarts of oil between Las Wages and SLC (420 miles) from
&gt; the pushrod tube leak!  Also thanks to Denise Howard for retrieving me from
&gt; BFE when the 63 DC died outside the Campground on the way in on Friday night.
&gt; The brushes in my 1.5 year old rebuilt generator died earlier in the day, and
&gt; after the 87 mile detour thru Parker, Arizona, I had to turn the lights on
&gt; when it got pitch dark, and the battery went slowly dead before completely
&gt; dying on the island in Lake Havasu!
&gt; 
&gt; Other than the 2 lost hubcaps, the shop rag fire under the 60 DC, the shredded
&gt; generator belt and slight overheating and subsequent tow job to Ronnie's from
&gt; west of Needles, we had an uneventful drive!!
&gt; 
&gt; Left a very limited edition bus calendar w/ Ronnie for all his hard work on
&gt; the event, and would like to thank VW Howard, Jim Bell, and all the Havasu
&gt; Bulli's for a wonderful time.  Hope to see everyone at Red Barn/Kelley Park in
&gt; April.
&gt;
