WWTD?
what would Tony do?

1963 bus VIN 1141269
Transmission is '64-'67 large nut style.
Ellis wants to attach ebrake cables.

Early cable = too short but has huge amount of bowden like sleeve at rear
wheel. (properly reaches from backing plate to cable tube in body)

Late '64-'67 cable = right length but has short bowden sleeve which requires
bracket on frame/inner rear whl well as on the '67RFH.

Question 1:
Is there a cable that fits without fabbing/welding the missing bowden
retaining brackets to the inner whl wells? Do I have to ask the Bro-inlaws
to weld in the brackets? (Seems 'kinda' easy fix).
Question 2:
Is anyone in the process of cutting up a 64-67 bus who could easily
hack/save the L/R brackets?
Question 3:
Why in the hell am I awake at 02:20 AM???

OK, I have attempted searching the archives at http://www.type2_dot_com/
April, 98 Tony Moore was switching a big nutter tranny into his '60 bus. Had
ebrake question. JThompson gave an answer stating to vin # and switching
ebrake handle...
