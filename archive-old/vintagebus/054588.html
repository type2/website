Subject: Re: [VB] Help with steering wheel

Sergio,

I have heavy duty puller I built just for removing steering wheels. I
am in Torrance and if your bus will drive over here, I can remove it
for you. Let me know. I will Pmail my address to you and we can
arrange a time.

By the way, I have some very nice looking steering wheels if you would
like to buy one.

Chris,
The Steering Man

Subject: [VB] Help with steering wheel


&gt; I tried to remove my steering wheel all this weekend and i was
unable to do it.
&gt; I had checked
&gt; the type2 archives several times and tried several different methods
and i was
&gt; still unable to
&gt; remove my steering wheel.. I would like to replace my steering wheel
as mine is
&gt; in really bad
&gt; condition. I am at the point that i am willing to pay someone to
remove my
&gt; steering wheel for
&gt; me. Please email me if you can help i live in Pomona California.
