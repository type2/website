This weekend I pulled out the multimeter
and dived into the messed up wiring on my
'64.

Looks like the whole thing was cobbled together
with butt connectors and tape and then taped over
to make it look nice.  Not ONE of the wires in the 
harness was correct accept where the PO had taped
the speedo light bulbs on to the new harness.

Decided to order a whole new wiring harness.

Anyone got the wiring harness from air-cooled_dot_net before?

Any recommendations?

Joe
