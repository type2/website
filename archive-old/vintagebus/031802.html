Craig, did you check your intake manifold to see if it's worn threw where
the heat riser and the manifold are mated. Also it's a bummer but 30 pict1
electric choke are no longer manufactured and/or imported. At this time all
that are available are 30 pict1 manual choke.
As for testing for intake leaks Aqua-Net hair spray in the aerosol can, all
the other stuff like WD 40, carb cleaner etc., are made to EPA friendly to
really work, but that HAIR Spray will work like a dream and it has holding
power. Think of the nice lacquer finish it will leave on your painted parts.

Subject: [VB] H30/31 carb tuning details


Well, as poor Ronnie knows, I spent the weekend ripping apart carb after
carb in search of one that made me happy - 6, to be exact - and all my 28
and 30PICT 1s are in dire need of some work beyond my skills. Anyone have a
NOS 30pict 1 :P?

Anyways, in desperation, I dusted off a 30/31 and rebuilt it... it had been
on the car a few years ago, but I HATED the MPGS with it: 12!!
And yes, I was using the jets etc listed in the Bentley for a similar carb,
as well as Barb &amp;Eric's specs.

So here's what is in there right now:  Main jet 112.5  emulsion tube 130
(book lists 140, but this is the biggest I have)   idle jet  65 (actually
reads 90.65)    pilot jet  55

Now, the pilot jet sits to the right of the idle jet - NO idea what it does.

Engine starts right away (1600 SP, stock muff, 009, choked 2/3 cold). Idles
ok. Is running leaner than the 30pict1 that was on there, as perceived by
my Patented Apron Trick: my apron gets hot to varying degrees on a 1/4 mile
jaunt around the block, depending on how lean the mixture is. Believe me, a
too-lean mixture is instantly evident with this method :)  Overrich means
it barely gets warm.
Anyways, I richened up the idle mixture some, but that's not really the way
I want to do things; I need to know which jets to play with to prevent lean
idle/lowspeed ops. I know that the 130 emulsion MIGHT restrict my top end
performance, but I haven't driven that fast yet :)

I guess I need to know what the idle/pilot jets control first, and what the
numbers mean, more or less fuel? IE, the main jet flows more FUEL as the
numbers get bigger, but the emulsion tube flows more AIR as the numbers get
bigger. If I can get a good idle with no stumbles off the blocks, I'll work
on that main jet and make sure IT is the correct size... THEN worry about
the emulsion tube size (that's the order these things 'take control' of the
mixture conditions in the carb).

And please save your typing time if you are gonna start carping about the
009 being the root of all my evils - I am aware of the problems some have
w/ this carb. They are NOT the cause of improper jetting. And while it may
contribute to it, the 009 is not the cause of the boggy off-idle I had with
the 30P1, as it had it with ANY dizzy. I can never remember whether this
bog is caused by too-rich an idle mixture, too much squirt in the accell
pump, or what... read it once, and forgot :P

Anyone want to write a good carb tutorial for the Library? There are
EXCELLENT bits and pieces, but no compendium of little things, like &quot;too
high an idle speed can make it difficult to get into first gear,&quot; &quot;spitting
back through the carb on acceleration often means a bad accel pump
diaphragm,&quot;  etc.
