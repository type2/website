Exactly how is that type 4 better? My friend has a 72 and he has replaced his 
motor 4 times. No the type 4 is expensive and breaks down more. It just 
sucks. Period. &gt;&gt;

Hi Phil,
If an engine is run to hard, badly maintained or rebuilt improperly one can 
expect a short engine lifespan.  In the late 1970-80s before the highway 
speed limit went up from 55MPH it was usual for a properly maintained type 4 
engine to reach 200,000 or even 300,000 miles before rebuilding even when 
powering the much heavier 72-79 bus!  Now a days the speed limit on our 
highways being 70+ MPH the type 4 engine seems to have lifespan problems.   
We used to cruise our big bore 40HP early 60 buses at 3,800 RPM, getting only 
19MPG and rebuilding them about every 40,000 miles or less.  When we dropped 
RPMs in same buses to 3,000 RPM for 27 MPG and 80,000+ between rebuilds.
