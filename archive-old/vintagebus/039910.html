&gt;While I agree with you in principle, note that Michel's email comes from a
&gt;Canadian address, and judging by the spelling of his name, it's possible
&gt;that Michel is bilingual, and English is not his first language.  He may
&gt;not have even realized that his response sounded as harsh as it did.  (and
&gt;it DID)

Folks i hardly Post on this list because i don't own a bus or have any good 
questions yet. Im young(13) And like to think that i have a very open none 
biased opinon. I have never bought any vw part From &quot;The Bus Depot&quot;. Look 
like Thom said please don't air your dirty laundry on the list. We Vw folks 
are a rare breed(Even more bus people) Vw folks are better kinder folks. 
Please keep things this way. The VintagVWlist has many more flamings and it 
is not very fun and lets keep the vintage Bus list at this. Please end this 
subject at this and start from scratch.
Sincerly Don't Have a bus But not wearing a flame retardent suit Kirin
