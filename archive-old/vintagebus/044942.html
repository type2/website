Subject: Steering gear box oil change.
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

I finally got around to changing the oil in my steering gear box the other day.  I had meant to do this since I got the bus 3 or 4 years ago, but....

anyway, it was on the hoist and I Put the oil bucket under neath and undid the 4 10mm headed bolts.  The two on one side you need to pry back the tab on the horn wire holder.   Then lightly tapped the bottom piece, and it rotated, pulled it down a bit

  nothing came out.

okay, then a liquid started dribbling out.  It was water 

then some rusty looking oil came dripping out

                          
I pulled th ehorn wire off thehorn (screw terminal 6V horn ) and pulled the wire through, the bottom bit off the steering gear box down and cleaned it up.   Did othere stuff for a while while it dripped dripped dripped.    Glued it back together, horn wire through and latched down attached to horn, bolts in and snug.   Filled up the box with gear oil, and adjusted it.


moral is...what is in YOUR steering gear box??
