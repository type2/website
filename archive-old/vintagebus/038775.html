OK, my theory is this.

Hippies bought their buses cheap.

They put on colorful paint.

The paint kept rust away.

The hippies graduated from college.

They sold their buses cheap.

The buyer restored the bus.

Hippies became doctors and lawyers.

They made wads of cash.

They bought back their buses.

This time for mega bucks.

The seller was very happy.

But sad to say farewell.

The yippies could care less.

That's his loss not theirs.

They buckled up for safety.

They drove to Whole Foods.

(That's an upscale grocery store.)

They parked in the front.

Everyone around oohed and aahed.

The yippies were again cool.

That is my bus theory.

Here is the sad part.

They meandered their way home.

They put the bus away.

In the garage under cover.

Next to the jet skis.

They forgot it ever happened.
