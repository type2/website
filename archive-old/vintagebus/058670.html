Subject: Re: [VB] Hot Wiring a Bus


Sounds odd but you might want to &quot;spray&quot; a small amount of Marvel Mystery 
Oil in the cylinders and sit for a while.  Not a ton... a spray.  Strange 
stuff but it does the damndest things.

&gt; &gt;The 66 Kombi I just picked up has been sitting in a lumber yard for a 
&gt;VERY
&gt; &gt;long time.  [...] I am going to want to crank it soon so i can see if the
&gt; &gt;current engine appears salvageable.
&gt;
&gt;You might want to try turning the engine manually with a wrench on the
&gt;generator or crankshaft nut.  This will tell you if it's totally siezed
&gt;or not.  I have _heard_ that if the rings are rusted to the piston or
&gt;cylinder, just hitting it with the starter can break the rings, but I
&gt;have no idea how true this is.
&gt;
&gt;Outside of that, the only thing I have to add to the electrical advice
&gt;is: if you do hot-wire it at the ignition switch, be careful to not
&gt;let the fat red wire short out on the dash, column, etc.  This is an
&gt;unfused feed directly from the battery, and I can guarantee you that
&gt;it will melt before the battery runs down.
