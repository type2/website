Subject: Re: [VB] Aircooled_dot_com Dist...wtf?

&gt;&gt; Ok folks...
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Who or what is aircooled_dot_com?  aircooled_dot_com resolves to 165.227.192.145
&gt;&gt; Which, with a web browser, brings up an &quot;account not available&quot; bit..
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt;It is www.aircooled_dot_net. Nice site, fairly new business by John Connolly. He
&gt;is a regular on the aircooled VW newsgroup on Usenet. It isn't an 009, it is
&gt;a SVDA distributor he modifies. Single vacuum, dual advance. He messes with
&gt;the spring and counterweights and guarantees a 3-4 mpg increase and a huge
&gt;driveability increase. More with a Pertronix. Lot of people on the newsgroup
&gt;speak highly of it. He does guarantee satisfaction on everything he sells so
&gt;he doesn't sell a lot of the common junk you can get anywhere. No slip in
&gt;big bore p/c's, etc. He's pretty heavy on the service after the sale, so if
&gt;you have any questions, e-mail him. He'll answer you.


It's $120 -- WITHOUT CAP AND ROTOR!!!   And it's NOT NEW, but a rebuilt
unit!!!
