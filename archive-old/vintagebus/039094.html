&gt;From: Jason &amp; Carla Bizzare &lt;bizzare_at_best_dot_com&gt;
&gt;I have installed a complete set of panels in a camper bus, 
&gt;double cab, and single cab, and
&gt;all three when exposed to any moister warped.

I had close to the same experience. I replaced the original gray kick panels
with Wolfsburg panels.  In my '62, the panels are screwed in.  I was able to
use what was left of the original kick panels as a pattern for drilling
holes in the new panels. The originals seem thicker but they also seem less
dense.  I have a feeling the Wolfsburg panels will look the same in 35
years. 

The new panels looked great for about a two weeks.  Then it got a little
damp and the panels warped between the screw heads. After adjusting the
holes a bit the panels have stabilized.  Other than a bit of &quot;warp memory&quot;
between a couple of screws, they look great.  Much better than what I had
and well worth the money.  

If I needed any more gray panels, I would try leaving them in the bus for a
month to let them stabilize before installing them.
