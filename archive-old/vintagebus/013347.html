&gt; Has any one ever heard of the lower &quot;mountain gears&quot; that were optional in
&gt; the splits for the reduction boxes?

This is M code 92. I've seen a number of split buses in the South American
Andes with this option code. This was described to me as a good option for
the splits used as taxis, as it gave good pull with the heavy loads of
people and cargo. But, I understood that this option involved different
gearing in the transaxle and not the reduction boxes.
