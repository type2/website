Subject: Re: [VB] fixing floor mat?  

&gt;&gt;As I have my barndoors floor mat out and it is 
unlikely I can find a decent 
replacement, and it is old and torn,  anyone ever 
happily repair one?   I 
hate moving it around.  The glycerin really does help 
soften it up, much 
better than yesterday it is, but that does not heal 
rips.  That black rubber 
cement?  superglue?  Anyone done this?&lt;&lt;


Try 3M's super weatherstripping adhesive, I'm not sure 
if it will work here, but it repaired one of my Teva's 
rubber soles after my dog chewed it up. It dries black 
and remains flexible (I can still run in them with the 
repair). The sandal is still going strong 5 years after 
the event. Just a thought, let me know if you try it 
and it works . . . Actually, the floor mat in my 67 
camper is busted a bit too, maybe I'll give it a dose 
of the SWH.
