Subject: Re: [VB] carb jetting - new concept for me ??


&gt;&gt; I've noticed several mentions of correct carburetor jetting and have to
&gt;&gt; admit I'm pretty clueless about it.  I am wondering if perhaps this is the
&gt;&gt; source of my persistent overheating (running at around 260+ in summer on
&gt;&gt; long (2 hours or more) highway drives at speeds of 50-55mph).
&gt; 
&gt; Hi Diana,
&gt; Could be.  Could also be wrong type muffler, air cleaner, cooling fan, relief
&gt; valve springs, lower pulley, clogged oil cooler, too high of RPM way over
&gt; 3,000 RPM at 55-60MPH, missing cooling tin, etc., etc.....
&gt; 
stock, stock, stock, stock, stock, new (oil cooler), don't think so, tranny
is stock AFAIK... also I don't go over 55 plus slowing down doesn't make a
significant difference, I've driven at 40mph in the desert and still had
temps over 260... cooling tin all there...  I think I've ruled out all the
etc's which is why I'm asking about the carb jetting.  Guess I have to pull
out all the jets that are in the carb and look at them?  Are the sizes
stamped on them?

Diana
