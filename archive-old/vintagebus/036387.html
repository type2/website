Subject: Is &quot;lowering&quot; a good thing?
Message-ID: &lt;7mnnio$kk8f_at_eGroups_dot_com&gt;

When I bought my 1967 Kombi it was already lowered. I am not sure if I
like it or not. I seems like a bumpy, uncompherable ride. But then on
the other side, it won't roll as easy.
Should I keep it? What should I do?
