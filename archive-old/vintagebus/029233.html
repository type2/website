Subject: re: [VB] AIRS Couple from FLA. 

Chad and Willa (and their dog, Butter) called me yesterday, about
5:30pm. I swiped a pulley from a spare motor and took my dog with me,
and found them at the Quality Inn off of I-385 in Greenville. Installed
the pulley, tried to find a spare belt in my parts stash for them (I
think I gave my last one away), hung out for a few minutes, swapped
e-mail addresses... They are driving a purple '72 with an upright in it,
bought recently from a bug that had been sitting for awhile. They are
strapped for cash, and the engine compartment looks pretty rough. I hope
they make it, they need all the help they can get... The crank pulley is
pretty rough, and I'm sure it is shredding the belt (evident by all the
black rubber dust in the engine compartment). I advised them to get a
spare belt as soon as they find a parts store open...

Meredith, I have one of your screwdrivers, that Chad found in his
toolbox...

Viva la Airs List!
