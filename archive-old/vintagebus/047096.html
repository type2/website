I think Thom was talking about the caps for the oil wicks in the cargo door 
hinges, not the weatherstripping around the doors.

 &gt; You can get these from any of the mail-order houses.  I've seen

 &gt; ones slightly better, because they had a &quot;flat spot&quot; on one side, which
 &gt; made them fit the channel better, and they have a flatter profile, so
 &gt; they didn't stick up as high.  I think the rubber ones were an adaptation
 &gt; of a bug part.
 Or, alternately...
 
 you can go to the hardware store and get the black self adhesive high
 density rubber weatherstripping.
 
 It is the perfect size, and it is like $3.00 for 10 feet.
 
 I did the back hatch on my bus with less than half a roll, and i plan on
 doing the cargo doors.  It'll maybe take 2 rolls.
 
 I got this tip from the DBG, and it will save me big bucks so im very
 happy :)
