Subject: re:Bright Lights big city

This is the key to the H4's versus all of these super expensive &quot;blue,
extra white....&quot; stuff that is out there. The H4's are very well controlled
light. There is very little glare even with the BIG bulbs. I can drive in a
caravan at night without pissing anyone off by simply lowering the beam
slightly. This only takes about a 1/2&quot; of lowering. I get the benefit of
seeing everything very clearly without blinding on coming traffic. We live
in the sticks and have very few street lights and the driving down the
Columbia Gorge can be quite treacherous without good lights. You are right
that the concern for big ole' lamps in the city would be wasted but out
here they are needed.
