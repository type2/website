Subject: Chet's progress as of last Thursday

Guten Tag, Upon further inspection, it was one of my front parking
lights.
I suspect that either I got water in the lamp on the connection, or that
the
connector on the switch touched the main power input and bypassed the
switch
and so forth fried the wire.  I'm probably going to drive it to WA w/out

parking lights and rewire it there.  Funny thing is that no fuses blew.
I've got a new carb on the way (I don't trust the one on there for going

over the Rockies) and the proper connections to go from the fan to the
HX's.
  Miss you guys, wish you could be here in the snow.  Happy
driving--Chet

I'd rather be poor and unknown.  If I were rich the gummint
would take the rest of my money.  If I was famous, everybody'd
be digging in my business.  You don't even know my dog's name.
