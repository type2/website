Subject: Back from CO.

OK, I just finished wading through 200 messages stacked up from my two
weeks on the road with the family. I've come full circle and finally
realized why my father hated having his seat kicked while he was
driving!!  Three thousand miles and two kids is a true test of wills. 

No it wasn't in a bus alas, but it was about as slow, since I was
tugging a 1952 15 ft aluminum travel trailer with an anemic Astro van
V6. I felt right at home doing 55 miles an hour and being blown around
left and right by the big rigs.

My question is, where was everyone at the RMMW show??  I did not
recognize anyone...well I did see &quot;everywhere Ed&quot; and the green
dormobile-like bus he drives...but that was it!  For anyone who has to
drive more than an hour to this show, I'd skip it.  I'm sure i'm spoiled
from all the large OCTO and Pomona events out here.  The local guys I'm
sure had a great time....for me though, it was a bust!  One guy selling
parts does not make a swap meet!

I was in the area going to my real destination a day later (the reason I
missed the Bandimere show...how was that...where was that???) so I
figured I'd get to the area early and see the show on Sat.   Did anyone
else go to this show?  JP said he was going, and frankly I did not walk
the camp area near the building to look.

Other than the show, I spied only 5 splits the entire trip.  The first
two were on my way to Gunnison CO heading up the Monarch pass.  A DC
with a cut down tilt and a silver panel traveling together.  Both with
guys driving...think the DC driver was smoking a stogie..and both from
AZ.  I assumed they were coming from the Bandimere show as it was about
4pm.  They were able to make 35-40 up the pass and that's about what I
could do...maybe 45.  I stopped to get a pic at the top and they passed
me and I lost them. 

I spotted a brief glance of a kombi parked on the streets of Gunnison
(was told there were a few more) but could not get a close look.  On the
way home driving through Durrango, I found a very nice complete and
solid tan and white deluxe HT with a spare on the front and one camper
window on the drivers side.  Looked like someone's driver as it was
parked near an apartment building and in derivable shape.  The last one
was today just outside of Kingman AZ (I'm sure all you PHX listees have
seen it before) on the top of a sign at a junk yard.  60's
kombi...yellow with writing on it.

That's it.   Anyone belong to any of these?  Not many busses, but I
spotted literally hundreds of resto candidates just waiting in almost
every farm house back yard;-)  I even spotted a 47 Westcraft I might go
back for.  Its like the good ol days of VW hunting.  Unfortunately I
have no room...fun to spot them though.
