Subject: Re: [VB] All I want for Christmas is: 

In relation to the Synchro Tristar on the wish list, bueses &lt;bueses_at_xxxx&gt; 
Asked Ellis: &quot;What no Fat Tire (amber ale) this year?&quot;

Ellis says that Fat Tire is a given. I am getting the stomach to prove it. I'm
starting to look like a middle-aged aerospace worker or something. [Rent
'Falling Down' with Michael Douglas] hahaha
Apparently the Fat Tire beer was not named for an old school bicycle.
A popular Clydesdale light or the Colorado light have fewer calories and
carbos. A Milling type supposedly has a third as many calories and carbos than
the horse or highcountry light. I could lose weight if I switched but what's
the point?

The way that I figure it is that any form of light beer or near beer is like
watching sex on television. It's similar in nature but worlds away from the
real deal. If you are going to be accused of inbibling in beer then you might
as well drink a beer not some liquid version of high altitude equine aftermath.
                                                                              
Don't ask... Being the married type, I'm more likely to drink beer and watch
TV. Hmmm... I wonder if it's too late to change my Christmas list. I think that
memory is the second thing to go but I forget...
Happy Hannukah (tomorrow _at_ sundown) and Merry Christmas to y'all.
