&lt;&lt; s an example, I hear the GoFast
 guys prattle on all day long about how &quot;stroked&quot; they are, and their webber
 42 DNF (did not finish) carbs, yet I never hear brakes mentioned. &gt;&gt;

That also comes up with some locals around here.  Brag about their dual 48s 
and big exhaust with no mention of braking improvements. In fact most of them 
are still running just plain old stock systems.

They tinker and tinker with their motors day after day while i run circles 
around them.
They might be able to get there fast but I can go farther in one piece.

I don't have anything against the fast VW guys at all.  In fact some day I 
hope to have one.  For now I will just kick back and enjoy the benefits of 
stock simplicity.

WooHoo!  Im finally 21 today!!

p.s. For my birthday my family all pitched in together and got me 2 round 
trip tickets aboard Air Luthansa to Frankfurt.  Gonna toodle around there for 
a week and a half.  Anyone know anybody I could visit out there? Listees? 
Cool VW people?
