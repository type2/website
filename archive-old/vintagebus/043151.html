Good point!
I bought a $9 item...the seller is going to charge me $4 to ship it
priority!!!!!!!!!  Better day on that.  Send it cheapo or don't bother...I
don't need a 33% markup thanks.

&gt; Another thing i do is if the shipping/handling isnt listed explicitly, i

&gt; item up to what they feel was fair...
