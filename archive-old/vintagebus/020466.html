&gt; Thanks for the thought. I had not thought about the
&gt; potentially corrosive

&gt; I still will find the fix-a-flat can useful if I get
&gt; stuck on a dark and 
&gt; stormy night.
&gt; BTW the rubber string thingy is what most shops do
&gt; for repair and that you 
&gt; can do yourself.
&gt; Obviously the rubber string does not work with tubed
&gt; tyres.

.....Green Slime...There is that stuff made local here
in Calif called green Slime..Never used it ...but I
hear it's good stuff.Ya just squeeze it into your tire
and it plugs small leaks when ya get them.I would
guess you might have to keep an eye on your tires for
nails and such and remove them to avoid more damage.

unrestored stock motorcycle he liked on tv......
