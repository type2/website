Hey Thom,

I've always loved the logo'd buses. It's true that you can go nuts. Take a
peek at any of the literature out there that showed commercial customers
what they could do. Heck, a lot of times they didn't even have an emblem on
the front! That makes restoration even easier!

I think that most of the commercial buses were primered on the inside.
Although, I suppose that if it were a showcase or display bus (i.e. door to
door sales) you would have painted the interior too. When I painted my 56 I
had in mind an old VW ad that showed a bus on safari painted up with zebra
stripes. So...seeing as how my bus was coachbuilt to go on safari...she
gained a set of stripes! It certainly gets attention, but it also has that
vintage feel too.

I like the idea of the Bosch logo. There's a barndoor that's on the So Cal
circuit that has a Telefunken logo on the side. It looks very cool, too bad
it's also slammed...

&gt;I like yellow.  I thought of pimping it up with a big Bosch logo.
&gt;
&gt;When buses were tarted up for commerical use, were the insides 
&gt;painted to match, or were they left the original color inside?
