Subject: Re: [VB] sundial vs westy

Hmm,well that was a &quot;really useful&quot; reply. Perhaps an example might clear
things up. I also own a 77 Riviera, I like the way its laid out, but the
westies I've owned have had a higher quality, the Riviera just seems more
flimsy in comparison. I know there must be folks on the list that have had
both, and was curious as to how they felt the two compared. As to value, I
think its a fair question to ask if an 'bastard' marque will return some of
the tons of money that will be plowed into it. And yes, I'm in the market
too, thats how I can afford to feed my buses.
