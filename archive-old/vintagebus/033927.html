Actually, the old man did have a pickup truck.
He used it to carry around radio parts.
Broken TV's. stereos, ect.
It was a later truck, Like a 64 or so, same logo on the side.
Similar atleast, its been a while since I saw the pictures.
He said it got wrecked in the 70ies.
Comments. Does it look THAT lame???
I havent broke out the vinyl cutter and the spray gun quite yet.
But it might be tomorrow?

&lt;&lt; Um, would radio stuff be transported in a pickup?  Doesn't make sense...

&gt;Any suggestions???
&gt;Does it look stoopid?
&gt;Its paint so its not going to come off too easy.
&gt;Looking for a &quot;yeah&quot; or a &quot;neigh&quot; before i break out the vinyl cutter and
the 
&gt;paint gun.
&gt;Any suggestions for the rear? Im thinking &quot;sales service 818-555-1212&quot; or 
&gt;something.
