Subject: Portland show sunday at SIR  (long)

Didn't do the whole Portland weekend, but Saturday said, right, time to load 
up the camper with swap stuff.. I pulled the ice box and rear facing seat out, 
folded the bed down, and proceeded to start packing... got distracting by 
testing radios though.  I had picked up this really pretty Sapphire I, then found 
the knobs, at the shows 2 weeks ago, and was hoping it would work, got out 
the speaker and battery and antenna, and nada  so disappointing.  Odd thing is 
the sapphire I I got out of the crusty junkyard, it had the light work, and the 
speaker crackle... a better show that the really clean looking one.   A 
couple people come over and I get most stuff packed, but become distracted from my 
previous goal of actually trying to sort through som stuff to clear space in 
the garage... a slow and involved proces... why is it so easy to fill up space 
and so hard to clear it out?   

Woke up early Sunday and jumped in the 65 green and white westfalia and 
headed south on I-5.   It was cool... even chilly , I had the heater on!!!!  I feel 
like jamming, so the radio was on (damn, front speaker came disconnected.. 
this that happens with the wipers, I really haven't driven Nellie much for a 
year or so, yup..list of things to fix on the old bus every has one, right)  Just 
jamming down the road... is my speedo right... did I go 106 miles by the mile 
marker in 90 minutes by the clock...  hm.. that 106miles /1.5 hrs ~70mph 
average.. but the speedo only touched 70 once... I just don't get it.  anyway I 
got to the line (huge immense line) to get into the show just about 8, having 
left home at 6:15 (120 miles) where's that GPS?

ended up in line behind David mayes and his son in the fire bus  :)   Red 
buses should have those blue lights on tiop, you know.   Nice line up of old 
volksies and race car trailers to get in.  eventually they let us through.   The 
show and swap were on the grass (dry) this time.. nicer tahn the blacktop I 
think so at least.  didn't really see much of th show... there was a tie-dyed bug 
(pretty cool) with a stock interiro and dash 67?  some cars like that are 
neat, but just too look at briefly,   couldn't drive that every day.   Some nice 
stock restored old pretzelwindow bugs.   It started getting really hot, I 
mangaed to get the awning up on the side of the bus.   Saw lots of people went 
blah blah blah volkwagen blah blah.   Cris Torlasco (sp) checked out my bus and 
declared it a westy... after we discussed the oddities of the M-codes (It 
doesnt actually have the westy M-code), windows and painting details, and the 
original panel between icebox and cargo doors. 
 I had Remembered the bits for David Mayes I had forgotten to bring when I 
went to Idaho. Handed over the Original Used Stock (OUS) gas tank grommet with 
success, but my 9mm splash pan bolt was rejected because of a dimpled face  :(  
 

concluded some other peplanned exchanges, and worked out a few more.   heh 
heh heh I will slowly clear the garage.

I did get the big gnarley UGLY front bumper... it is so excellent.. going to 
go on my truck, which will be a monster.  The sort of bumper people will look 
at and get out of the way.  Scare the yuppies.    He dropped it off and ran 
away as if he thought I'd change my mind.  ?

Okay.. &quot;gotta get truck going gotta get truck going gotta gotta gotta gotta 
get truck going&quot;
(repeat until mission accomplished or driven batty)

some guy asked if the bus was for sale... I said, well... maybe.. I have been 
thinking of selling her and fixing up the SO-23 ...  but no he couldn't take 
it now, I'd need to take me and my stuff home gave him a card... maybe he'll 
call.  did I mention it was getting really hot and I didn't have a hat?   My 
apologies to anyone I was babbling at... I think the sun  was affecting my 
brain... drank loads of water and ate some oranges.

Eventually packed up (big bumper on roof rack)  and followed Eric in his 
tatty OG paint early post BD '55 23 (nice bus) to his house to pick up a westy 
kit, which he didn't think would fit in my bus, but everything but the ~5x5 
flooring did.  Ve haf vays of packing into the Volkswagen.  hung in the shade and 
went blah blah bus blah blah.  

 Left P-town at 6:45... cruised N on I 5 at 55-60 cause of the heat well for 
about and hour,  then hit the worst traffic jam...   before the crossing of 
hwy12.   durn it's hot.  eventually got to Chentralia where I stopped at Taco 
Bell, decided to park the bus and use the restroom...

 Must have been something going on around there.. lots of screaming happy 
wound up kids... was there a fair day?  Got my burritos, and left.  Then, the 
bus, of course wouldn't start... after driving on fryway generally have to use 
the secret starter deal rather than the key, PITA, but this time no dice.  five 
kinda punk teenagers were hanging out by the taco bell... I bummed a push 
start off them (Thanks!!!!)  I really need to buy a new starter.. this has gotten 
so old.   dark now.. turn on headlights

Got back on I-5 N, still traffic jam.  eventually get to mile post 89, where 
on the other side of the road a firetruck sits... traffic speeds up.. whew!!!! 
 The last few miles go quickly... but it duid take over 4 hours to get home.  
 

Heard this morning on the radio it was a fire there starting ~4pm, and the 
freeway was closed for 3-4 hours.   Got a little sunburnt... need a new hat, the 
old ones gone missing.. but a fun show as ever.
