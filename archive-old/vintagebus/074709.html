It came off my new carb linkage and I limped home on 1 carb.  I went back 
and looked for it several times, but I couldn't locate it.  If this is the 
correct part from CIP- BALL PIVOT 8MM LOCKING NUT FOR HEX BAR LINKAGE - SET 
OF 4 Code C18-3363 they are 3.95.  If thats not the part or if anyone else 
knows of another source...  Can something like that be found at a hardware 
store? TIA.
