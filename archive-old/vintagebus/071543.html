Subject: Re: [VB] Nitpicky question

You shouldn't have to use any glue.  It's got a prickly thing on the top
that goes into the seal for the entire sliding window area.  And then
there's a small rubber block that hold it in at the bottom.  The last screw
that holds the metal strip with 4 indentions on it (for the sliding window
to latch into) also goes into that rubber block to keep it in place.  If you
need this explained a little better, just ask.  I replaced the seals right
there not long after I bought my bus.

&gt; Volks,
&gt;
&gt; The metal&quot;brace&quot; that is glued onto the non-sliding portionof the front
&gt; door windows on my bus have come away from the glass.  What sort of
&gt; adhesive will do the trick?
&gt;
&gt; Best,
