For the story, go to http://www.sfgate_dot_com

My colleague received the CHP call regarding the VW being pushed overboard this
morning... we  (SF 911) got the call kinda late, after 5:00 am. Neither CHP nor
SFPD knew  whodonnit , and the only news footage I saw was from the Coast
Guard's monitor device, with which the local Channel 2 aired at close to 9 am.
It was reportedly just a VW shell, with a big number &quot;3&quot; (or more likely, a
letter &quot;E&quot;) spray-painted over the hood.

Everyone was trying to get a glimpse of it. Even the local news team wished the
Coast Guard to delay the cutting of cable a bit unitl they can get some
footage. But the thick fog lingered for too long, and the rubberneckers jamed
the traffic, prompting the Coast Guard to cut the bungee cord that kept the bug
dangling.

It wasn't a bus, thankfully!

&gt; Hi everyone,
&gt;
&gt; I know it's not friday, but a guy at work today said someone bungie jumped a
&gt; VW bus off the Golden Gate Bridge today in San Francisco.
&gt; Can anyone support this or is it a BS rumor.
&gt; I tried channel surfing and checking local internet sites for info, but
&gt; nothing.
&gt; I want to see some pics or hear some truth.
&gt; Anyone got some.
&gt;
&gt; Thanks,
