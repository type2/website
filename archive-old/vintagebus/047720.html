We Must Save Them!!!!

repeat this over and over to yourself as you work on the beast.  It is a
labour of love. 

So back to work on the 59 truck (buildt Dec 58).  Did I mention it was FILTHY?
The engine compartment a slimy black under which red (?) could be seen, and a
few specks of the original dove blue could be glimpsed like elusive mountain
spirits.

I started with the taillights.  The old wierd shaped 40s ford or whatever they
are had to go.  In went the original style round glass taillights.  My arms
became blacked with tar in the process.    Does this sound familiar?   Ick.

Put in the 6V Battery and started switching dash light bulbs to convert it
back to 6V.  Replaced the starter bushing and installed a good 6V starter.
The tranny boots were good, so I drained the tranny oil. 

Here I started freaking out.  Not only was it black, but it had a lot of
shavings in it.  Actually, some of the shaving could be called chunks.   The
largest was about a half inch traingle and an eighth inch thick, and
distinctly resembled a gear tooth.  It came out of the differential.   I
drained the reduction gear boxes- no big stuff there.  So I filled the tranny
and gear boxes with 30 weight engine oil.  Installed the 6V 40 hp motor with
bug muffler.   I decided to leave the bug muffler on as I had a bumper (old
one from Nellie) that had been cut out and i didn't want to hassle with it.
Hooked up a good horn.  Put a wiper arm and blade on.   Key didn't start the
car.  Key is on the dah in a wierd spot anyway and is begging to be fixed.
Hooked up a press button in the engine compartment.   Started it up and let it
run for a while, then drove up and down the street, and promptly drained the
oil from the tranny.   More grit, already dark colour that oil.   And more
shavings come out.   The rear brakes all looked good BTW.   Hey, did you know
that early  brake cables (for the split case tranny buses) run about $75 a
piece new?   These ones are pieced together.       So I filled up the tranny
and reduction gear boxes with tranny oil.  But the wierd thing was the tranny
sounded fine.   ? ? ? ? ? ? 

So, what else, oh, messing with the shifter and fixing some wiring and
changing the headlights over to 6V.  The wiper motor works but is noisy.
Painted Nellie's old rear bumper white, just rattle canned it, and put it on.
Got the horn working and the taillights working.  Replaced a lot of connectors
on the wiring, and cleaned things up.   Picked up the oil bath air cleaner I
brought with and found it full of dirt.   So I spent some time cleaning it
out, and put oil in it and installed it which was a little funky as the coil
was in a different place as it had pulled out of the fan housing so I plugged
some holes and put it all together.   

At some point I swept and hosed it down under and around the truck as I had
tons of bits of stuff on me and in my hair and it was icky.

Got a trip permit at the DMV and drove the truck around a bit, filled it up
w/gas.  It has a big tank and took about 14 gallons.   

One wierd thing is the gas guage works.   Some one installed a non VW as guage
to the right of the steering wheel and it reads about jalf full after I filled
it.  Would this be as it is a 12V guage (I suspect) and the truck is now 6V?  

(BTW, this all took more than a day)

Anyway, I have a few more things to do, so I will go do them.  

The plan is to leave tomorrow from the Bay Area, and, barring any mishaps,
arrive Oly day after.   Stop in Redding,   So if anyone sees a grey 59 Single
Cab with black markings stopped on the side of the road, it's probably me.    

Clara
