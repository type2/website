Of course one of the best ways to prevent a fire is to have new fuel lines 
put on, but this isn't a 100 percent prevention, both of my fires were caused 
when the small brass tube going into the single center mounted carb came loose 
and sprayed gasoline on the distributor.
Hi Busbarn,
Replacing the German flexable fuel lines every two to three years is very 
important!  
Also very important to make sure the metal fuel line as it passes through the 
front engine tin has its grommet or make one out of a piece of German 
flexable fuel line slit down one side and hose clamped in place!  We also have had 
the brass pressed in tubes in the fuel pump loosen.  This can not only be fixed, 
but prevented by center punching around the hole the brass tube is in thusly 
shrinking it onto the tube.
  Another possible way to help put out an engine fire or at the very least to 
keep it from getting totally out of hand, is if one has a reserve switch, to 
pull it out halfway to shut off the fuel from the tank.  This will help in the 
case the fuel line from it to the fuel pump is compromised, or damaged due to 
a fire in the engine bay.  In the bus (except SCs being the fuel tank is 
mounted lower) almost the entire fuel tank is higher than the fuel pump.  So lose 
that fuel line and without a reserve switch up to ten (or fiffteen gallons if 
running 68 and later tank) will just keep on pouring out!
  As for fire extinguishers the small disposable ones are better than 
nothing, but are almost always not up to finishing the job!  Five Lbs. size 
extinguisher is the minimum we carry.   Ammonium phosphate base type is probably the 
best to put out all three types of fires.  There are two minor problems with 
this type though.  One this chemical is corrosive, so a complete tear down of the 
engine to long block, and washing it and the engine compartment out several 
times is required afterward.  Also this chemical tends to cake inside the 
extinguisher if it is not turned over once a month.  When caked all one gets is a 
whoosh of air and no fire retardant!  So turn them over and listen/feel for a 
sandy slump kind of movement inside.  If no movement a rubber hammer applied 
for half an hour or more might loosen it back up.
