Subject: Bye Friends!

The signal to noise ratio on the list has reduced to the point where I
will say my goodbyes for now.  It will be four years in Nov that I
started lurking on the list in anticipation of buying my first bus.  I
was specifically searching for a DC.  The list has served me quite well
during that time and I hope that I have contributed in kind.

I first thought that much of the current trouble was due to the events
that occured on my 44th birthday which will forever live in infamy, but
a search of my local archives back to 05/01/01 show that the barbs,
flames, name calling started well before that.  Those that are in the
process of throwing barbs and using 9/11 as an excuse are exposed by
seeing what they were up to before the 11th.

Now I'm getting pmails from those wishing to continue their diatribes
but have been pushed off the list.

I'll happily correspond to those who may have questions about my DC and
what lies benieth it,

I understand why the rules are as they are on this list.  Friday's
flexible envelope gets pushed beyond recognition sometime, but the list
has always kept working.  Free speech advocates, there are upteen places
on the internet where you can go to vent your anger, frustrations.

Finally, to my friends that have helped me so well, its been fun and
THANK YOU, see you on pmail.

My best wishes and regards to all,

Scott
'60 DC w/2L Type IV
