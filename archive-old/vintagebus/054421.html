Subject: Re: [VB] Westy rear seat

I have a rear seat from a '67 walkthru I have taken pictures of (ironically 
so the gentleman I am shipping the kit to can see how it all fits together 
after re-assembling). I can send them to you, if you'd like.
Let me know.
Jon

informational comes up.  Thanks troops.

&gt;
&gt;Hey guys, this is my first posting in about a year, on and off working on
&gt;my
&gt;bus. I have a standard '58, and i bought a rear seat from a '68 westy
&gt;walkthrough. Trouble is  I have no idea how to put it in my bus. The bolts
&gt;on
&gt;bottom line up, but i can't figure out which way the hinges are supposed to
&gt;face, or if it will even fit at all. Can anyone tell me that it is no use
&gt;trying, or send me some pics of an installed seat that can help me?!
&gt;                                                                    Thanks
&gt;for
&gt;any help!!!
