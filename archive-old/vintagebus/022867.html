Get soemthing to hold the frame steady.  Using a SHARP utility knife, cut
into the rubber along the channel at an angle / then again at the other
angle \ now you should have a triangular section which will easily pull
out.  Do so.  Don't be afraid to hit the blade on the inside metal - you
need to make sure you really cut it.  Also, you want a really good angle
going in there - get the shallowest angle relative to the perspective of
the channel that you can.   Basically you want to cut as large a piece out
of the middle as you can.

Now with a fine screwdriver, persuade one of the remaining three sections
to the center, and lift it up.  If you're gentle, you can pull the entire
&quot;string&quot; out this way.  Repeat for the other side.

&gt;frame.  When i pulled the rubber off, it cracked, and left the part in the 
&gt;channel still in the channel.  Anyone who has replaced rubber on windows 
&gt;hopefully knows what I am talking about.  How do I get the remaining strip 
&gt;of rubber out of the channel in the window frame?  It looks like it should 
&gt;just slide out, any tricks for &quot;convincing&quot; it to come out easy?
