Subject: Re: [VB] Eberspacher BN-4 troubleshooting question

If they sit for a while sometimes they get a little cranky. Have you checked the restart switch? With the fan facing you and the top off, there is a clear plastic &quot;box&quot; that has a red switch on the right hand side, push it it back and it should spring forward. I would also check the in-line fuse.
 
As far as the pump goes it has a set of points under the plastic cap where the hot lead connects. The point gap should be set at 1mm. connecting 12volts to the terminal and a ground to the body itself should tell you what you need to do with that.
