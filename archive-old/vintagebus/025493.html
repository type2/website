&gt; Hi all,
&gt; 
&gt; Ok, Maybe this is a little off subject, as it doesn't relate to the
&gt; mechanics of our beloved vehicles, but it is related.  As you may or may
&gt; not recall, I search and rescued a 65 standard.  And while I love
&gt; working on it and it is currently garaged, which I also like, the
&gt; spiders also seem to like it.  The most frequent incounter is the
&gt; harmless daddy long legs, I have also had two encounters with the big
&gt; red hourglass BAS#*RDS (Black Widows). 
&gt; 
&gt; I planned on just buying a few of those bug bombs and letting them rip
&gt; through the garage killing everything in or around, but thought I would
&gt; consult the collective list for any tricks of the trade.  I have three
&gt; more wheels to pull and expect many more encounters.
&gt;

Hey Aaron

I had the same problem. I bought a '71 Crew-Cab in very rusty condition
&gt;from a guy in Pacific Beach, (above San Diego.) Took it home to
Oceanside in the hopes of restoring it. Put it in the garage, and
started working on it. One morning, as I walked past it, I realized I
had walked thru some spider webs. Thought about it later, and took my
big 300 watt work light, and, looking around, spotted a BIG Black Widow!
Thought about it about two seconds, and went to the hardware store and
bought two boxes of bug and spider bombs. Made sure the hot water heater
gas was turned off, pulled my other cars out, closed the garage up very
tight, and set those suckers off! Let it all set closed off til the
afternoon, opened it up and turned the fans on, and started looking.
Didn't have to look very far. Found THREE HUGE Grandma Black Widows, D E
D, Dead, Dead. HAAAHAAA, EEEWWWW ...

I was ready to bomb 'um again, so I set off two more, just to be sure. I
never felt good about sticking my hands it the truck innards again, and
eventually sold it. But, I found another soon after, with no spiders. 

But I keep looking ...
