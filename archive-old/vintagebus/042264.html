&gt; One of the first steps in the process is an acid bath
&gt; to clean and etch the wheels.  Your aluminum wheels 
&gt; wouldn't survive the bath.
&gt; 
&gt; Perhaps you should consider getting them polished instead;
&gt; a good polishing job is almost as bright as chrome, but
&gt; is more subtle.  Me, personally, I think chromed Fuchs
&gt; look a bit too &quot;matchbox&quot;

Or anodized. Actually well polished alum should look as good as chrome.
Just a LOT of work.
