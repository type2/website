Hello,

Not really.  The '67 should have a 12 volt nose cone with the
back up light switch and the smaller 12 volt starter bushing
but that's about all I can think of to identify what it is externally. 
These things are so old now and have had so many fingers
poking around the inside its impossible to say that any 30
year old transaxle has this or that gearing.  Over half the Bus
transaxle cores I get anymore are really Beetle gearboxes 
that they have swapped in when the original trans failed.
