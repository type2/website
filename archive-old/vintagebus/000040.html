 I saw one myself in my recent travels.  I just have to find out if it is for 
sale.  I have always wanted one.  Actually, I want the one for a bus with 
belly pans.  This one was on a 61 turquoise standard walkthrough if I 
remember right.  Como green interior and bullet lights... pretty cool.  
Actually, it might have been the other turquoise one that was the walk 
through.

wow!!!!! that is so freaking cool!   I have been wanting a 61 
turquoise/bluewhite non sunroof deluxe for years, and have never seen nor 
heard of a 61 being that colour till now.   Available for 4 months of 
production.   Heck if it was the right model I'd go to Arizona to get it.

(do I get bonus points on the are you a VW nut quiz for that?)
