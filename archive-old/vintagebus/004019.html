Subject: [VB] Smacked roof repair
Date: Mon, 7 Feb 2000 22:35:27 -0500
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

I was admiring the iron oxide formations on my '62 bus last weekend -- ah,
the wide open spaces of the rotten rockers!  Well, at some point, this
ex-church-bus had a luggage rack mounted onto the roof.  The kind where you
have to drill holes of course, to make my life interesting.  At the front of
the roof it looks like a branch whacked it.  It's not an extraordinarily
large dent and it doesn't extend to the drip rails, but it has made the
overhead vent in the cab separate a touch from the roofline.  It's mostly
all attached but the dent has pushed it down in places.  The PO had
ingeniously filled the gaps with spray foam.  Darn clever, those POs.

My idea to fix the rack holes is to grind at the ragged metal inside the bus
(it's like they simply drove nails through it!), weld it up when it's all
smooth, and grind again.  I'm sort of at a loss for the front
dent/vent-coming-off-sorta mess though.  If the vent can come off, I would
think the best repair would be to remove it or pry it down a bit, and fix
the dent that way.  If it can't, or is difficult to remove/replace, I'm not
sure how to best approach it.  Any suggestions on how to remove the overhead
vent or what to do in general?
