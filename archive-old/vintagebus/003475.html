Subject: Single Strap air cleaner detail

I was comparing my 2 &quot;single-strap&quot; air cleaners today and I noticed one has
an indent in the middle of the side facing the fan shroud and one does not.
They are the same part # and are physically identical except for that.  It's
sorta like it needs the indent so it doesn't hit the fan shroud but they
both have more than enough clearance to not need that indent.  Anyone know
why?

Here's an old pic of my engine compartment, not that you can see the indent:

Good info for those who want to know what heck a &quot;single strap&quot; air cleaner
is, too.  It's a 54-55 Barndoor Bus and Oval Window Bug thing.

Curious,
