&gt; site guru's could prioritize or comment on?  Given some responses I need to 
&gt; be mindful of copywrited material so as not to attract the attention of the

This is very, very important if the doc project isn't to be wiped up by VWoA,
or Bentley, or VW-AG(!) lawyers.  The purpose as I stated when the project
was conceived is to make available documentation that is no longer in print,
fairly difficult to find, and unlikely to see print in the future.  For
that reason it was decided not to scan the early bus workshop manual since
(at least at the time) there was lots of talk of getting Bentley to reprint
it.

The material we have on the site is probably mostly still under copyright, and
we don't take the notices out.  We also don't think that anybody will care that
we have this stuff online, otherwise we wouldn't put it up :-)  In addition,
if anything is republished or announced to be republished, we will pull it
from the site.  It goes without saying that any C&amp;D orders won't be fought and
the whole site could go down in such a fashion.  I barely have money for
school ;-)  I would at least demand a registered letter.

Just thought I should make this clear for anybody who might be thinking of 
lending materials to the project.  And thanks!
