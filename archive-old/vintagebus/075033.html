  You can always get BRM 15 inch copies. Flat Four (sold through Moon Eye's)
are down to 139.95 each now and Speedwells can be had for 500 to 800 dollars
a set, depending on who you buy them from! You can also get Randars for 1000
dollars a set or get a set of Radar copies being unvailed at the Classic
(not by me) for 800 dollars or less a set.
