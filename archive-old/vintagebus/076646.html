----- Original Message -----

&gt; i wrote wrong in caps because you inferred that underinflation was no
&gt; prob, and better than over.

Quote me where I say that, and i'll eat my words. Just because I'm not
supportive of overinflation, does not mean I'm in favor of underinflation. I
vote for &quot;correct&quot; inflation, which is completley different than
underinflation. I even mention that I add a couple pounds to the figure the
formula gives you.
