&gt;Oh, and for the occasion, I bought a new paint gun.  I went to HF to buy a new
&gt;regulator-thingy, and ended up buying their top-of-the-line gravity feed HVLP.

OK so what brand and model number is this new wonder tool???

&gt;It also uses the paint-in-a-ziploc-bag thing, but that only worked well for a
&gt;few minutes, then something happened and there was paint everywhere, all
&gt;down my arm, on the floor, etc.

Operator error???  Or was this a recoverable problem?
