O K, I have just started to have to do some of  my own work. Used to have a
good shop &amp; here in town &amp; it was easier to let him do it. He figured out he
could make more  money working on stuff like new Porsches, Mercedes, ect. so
he quit the air cooled stuff. Good business decision for him, bad for me.
First question: what the hell are y'all talking about when you say 'big
nuts' ? I mean on the bus ( or, in my case, truck) I thought it was the axle
nuts, but mine are the same size as the Ghia, real close to 11/2 &quot;
You ain't talkin' about the driver, are you?

Next, I had  the trans geared to 3:88. With the reduction boxes, what does
that make the final drive? 15&quot; wheels on the 63 double  cab.
                    thanks, bigdog
