Subject: Re: [VB] 80+ bearings? because...
Message-Id: &lt;v02130501b48b3c8f71c0_at_[209.245.213.154]&gt;

&gt;80 over and marginally pounded thrust begs for leaving
&gt;the bearings out and running it at the next events
&gt;&quot;engine blow&quot; contest! Why not just (figuratively
&gt;speaking) burn the case at the next Jerome and search
&gt;for a better used or a mondo expensive new case?

&gt;Is it common that folks now-a-days are thinking
&gt;nothing of 80 out cases?
&gt;-ellis

People - including VW - have ALWAYS thought nothing of running 80 over
cases. That's why they made the bearings. Think that's bad? I have a set of
100/20/100s!  VW made bearings that size because they felt that it SHOULD
work... mebbee not too well, but it should work. OK, at least VW doBrasil
thinks that way  :)
I have 30 or so cases, 36 hp to 2L, and ALL are rebuildable and useful
DESPITE some wide bores.
And many of these cases will go and go despite HIDEOUS damage and slop...
my spare had almost a 1/4&quot; of endplay and it would go 65mph for hours (you
just had to keep the idle at 1000rpm or higher or the oil would go away and
it would stop dead!).  Best engine in the world it is not, but it does what
I need it to do.

If you can get a new case, do so. If you can't, get the best used one you
can, clean it up and go. A paid-for 80 might be better than an
unpayable-for 20. Do you know where to get NEW 40 hp cases? 36? Man, I've
never even SEEN a  25 hp case. If you have an uncracked case for these
years and it needs to be bored out, fine; it beats the car sitting in the
drive for many moons waiting for that uncut German metal to drop in to your
lap.

And please don't burn or blow UNcracked cases... VW de Mexico is ceasing
production of the Beetle in 2002; after that, NO new engine cases. In 30
years people will be happy to see an otherwise-fine 80 over case!
I also have an old Ch*vy pickup (rebuilt it with original Babbitt bearings
:)), and recently lost a junkyard parts truck - a frame with some rotten
metal piled on it - to a guy who paid 500 to haul it off. Why? Because it
had an UNCRACKED block in it, and they are getting hard to find.

Me, my new rebuild is a 40 over taht a p/o had clearanced for a stroker,
but failed to properly shim the heads and never got it to work right. I
could have slapped  oversized jugs back in and rodded it, but I knew 40
over wouldn't last too long when 'warmed up' so I went to stock.  I am
hoping to get 60k outta it -  if I am a good boy with maintenance and
driving habits, I don't see why not. It should die slowly rather than
abruptly, and I will save up meanwhile for a NEW case to store for Der Tag.
And just in case, I have a shed full of bored out cases and the bearings
to fit them.............
