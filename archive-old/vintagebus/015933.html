Hey everybody:

Well, I went to Kool April Nights in Redding CA this past weekend and it was 
a pretty good show.

The Volkswagen turnout was slim (as always) with about a dozen cars. The VWs 
this year were high quality cars including the famous &quot;Low Fat&quot; oval Bug 
from the cover of the January 1981 issue of Hot VWs.

This show is mostly for the street rod crowd. It was reported that a total 
of 2,130 cars entered this year. It seemed like about a third of those cars 
were 55 to 57 Chevys.

The vendor area needs improving. For a show of this size there were only a 
handful of vendors selling automotive related products. Too many people 
selling sun glasses, cowboy hats and NWO shirts.

All things considered, it was a good deal for 5 bucks.
