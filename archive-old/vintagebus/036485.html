My '59 has been mostly converted to a 12volt system. One of the only things
left is the 6volt wiper motor. While weighing my options, I found this
page: http://www.acvwjyro_dot_com/acvwjy/6-to-12.htm. On there I found this
info:

&quot;When we got the Clubhouse (65 II), the WW motor was fried this way, and we
couldn't locate a replacement motor. But interestingly enough, the WW
frame and transmission assembly from a 77 bus matched the 65 frame exactly
in the distance from wiper shaft to wiper shaft, although the holes through
the body for the shafts had to be enlarged to 3/8&quot;. Unfortunately, the 77
WW motor was much too large to fit between the shelf and the dash. But the
good
news was that a Super Beetle motor, much smaller than the 77 bus motor,
bolted right up to the 77 bus transmission, and that's the way the
Clubhouse is
to this very day. &quot;

Anyone else tried this before? Sounds like a good aproach to take. Would
the wiper frame &amp; transmission be the same thing for all years of Baywindow
Buses?

my response is don't do it.    Drilling the holes out larger and probably
mushing the heater pipes makes me want to cringe.   

It should not be difficult to find a replacment 6V motor, and install a
voltage drop.  I've seen voltage drops for a 6V motor in a 12V VW  where you
can have 2 speeds, too, if you want them. 

I have 6V wiper motors and voltage drops in my 61 and my 65. (both are 12V)

The wiper motor in the 59 truck I just got squeaks terribly.   I'll take it
out and grease or replace it, and reinstall it, but that is 6V anyway, so the
voltage bit is irrelevant there.


But, talking about the truck, a lot of things had been done to it like that
later motor into splitty deal, which are a real PITA  to sort out.
