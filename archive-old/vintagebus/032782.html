 Anyone ever figure out what m-code 374 or 195 are? That '62-'63 
 walk-thru I just picked up has both. It also has 027 which everett 
 has listed as fog lights. Can anyone elaborate on that one?

195 is elusive and mysterious, and evidently found generally 62/63.

I tried to search the vintage bus site for info on 195, but I failed 
miserably at figuring it out.  is it found on euro version?  or just the N Am 
version?

 color codes show as TK BLW. What are those for?


====================
turquoise/blue white.

 p.s. I have discovered that the SO-42 camper conversion was harvested 
 from a junkyard bus in the 70's and transplanted to this earlier 
 cherry '63.

you can see what year kit it is by looking at the westy tag on the Z bed - it 
is on the formica between the access door to get stuff under the Z, and the 
cargo doors of the bus.   the bay bed is more comfy
