Subject: what not to do when adjusting valves, missing locknut

 I adjusted the valves on the 70 westy after it had blown a fan belt and been drive about 1/2 mile.
 
Well they all seemed ok but after a 5 mile drive to Peninsula Auto in Campbell they made a really clickey sound.
 
I put the bus up on the ramps again and lo and behold the locknut was missing and one valve had .100&quot; clearance!
 
Where was the locknut, I thought it had gone down the pushrod tubes and was thinking an engine teardown. I also thought that I had to take a trip to a VW FLAPS and get a new locknut.
 
I gave Clara(lw) a call and she said take a locknut of the spare engine I had in the garage for my 73 Thing, good idea, instead of driving 5 miles and back.
 
So I took out two valve adjusting bolts with their locknuts and got under the 70 bus. When I felt for the valve cover, it rattled and the locknut had not fallen down the engine, it was in the valve cover on the concrete driveway!
 
So folks, make sure you torque the locknuts when you adjust your valves.
 
BTW is the vale clearance .004 or .006 on a 1600 single port?
