Subject: Re: [VB] With New Rubber, Vents Won't Close

the rubber that goes to the top half of the doors for the vent wings is a 
PITA to install.  If you don't get it right, it won't close.  The thick piece 
you have to wedge in before installing teh vent glass&amp;frame.   I'd try 
messing with that if it was me.
