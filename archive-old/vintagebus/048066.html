First off the Friday topic: I like to go to Berkeley and cruise the Type 2 
down Telegraph Ave and have all the hippie chicks flash the peace sign at me.

you get you some jailbait.   


Second Safari windows: Everyone complains that safaris leak.  On most buses I 
have met the stock stationaries leak too!
-  --  - -
my 61's stock safaris leaked only in heavy rain after installation w/new 
glass, NOS body to frame seals (4? years ago), Now they always leak.   After 
redoing stock windsheilds in my westy, a couple years later they do not leak. 
   I live in W WA and it rains here.    You California guys only have rain 
part of the year.   Safaris leak even after redoing them.    :(    my 61 has 
the front floor to match.  :(   But fun in the summer, as you say, especially 
if it falls on a weekend.
