Hey All,

Hey Thom I was wondering if you could share you steering box mixture you 
mentioned a few months back.  Something like 2 part stay-lube 1 part 
straight 50 or something.  Also is there any tricks I should know to 
draining and refilling my steering box.  I'm still slacking w/ no Bentley w/ 
a great working box, just thing I should put some new lube in the beast for 
friendly preventativee maintenance.

One Week Til High Country!
Thanks,

Eric

&gt;There is no &quot;adjustment left in&quot; when it comes to steering boxes; when they
&gt;get to the point where you're monkeying with it, it's a sign from The Great 
&gt;Bob
&gt;that you need to get it rebuilt...
