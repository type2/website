&gt; I'm here to aid in any engine question, or just to shed some light on
&gt; some theories and ideas from time to time....
Hi Jack,

I have an idea for an engine, and thought maybe you could tell me what was
involved.

I have an early 70's 1200 (40 horse) case with cam bearings that is in
great shape... 

I want to make a stroked 40 horse motor.... (stock p&amp;c, 69mm crank) but
the big end on 40 horse rods is different from the big end on 1500+
rods. and you'd have to use the 40 horse rods with 40 horse pistons as the
wrist pins are different...

What all would I need to have done machine work wise to make this
work... or should I just have it cut for maybe 1300 or 1500 jugs so I
could use later rods...

take care,

Steve
