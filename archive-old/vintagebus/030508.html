Subject: National Geographic

Finally, after several years, found the issue of National Geographic
that my bus was in. Apparently it was in the May 1972 issue. It was
owned by a NG photographer. There are some issues for sale on the net
but the guy wants $13 for them and I just think thats a bit high. I am a
patient guy.
