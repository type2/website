Thanks... I will be interested in joining.  By the way, our local chamber of
commerce is having a car show on Aug 13.  I would bring my 66 Beetle, but I
will be in Germany instead.  Please pass the word to your fellow
clubmembers, as I would like to see aircooled VWs represented there,
especially since it is a traditionally German neighborhood.  Go to
www.linconsquare_dot_org or call the chamber office at 773-728-3890.  It is held
on the 4700 block of north Lincoln Ave.

By the way I did not haul it home, I DROVE it!  :-)

Hi Paul,
    I live in Barrington and my daily driver is a 64 turquoise kombi
(  http://dreamwater_dot_com/dbg/woodall6.htm )
which I drive into Chicago 2-3 days a week. I ,with many of my fellow club
members, were checking out that bus at MOFOblo and thought it was a nice
truck,however my wife would have shot me had I hauled another home.I'm glad
someone local snatched it up !
    If you are at all interested in joining a local bus club,then check out
our website
at http://dreamwater_dot_com/dbg/ .We are a fun loving group who love to camp in
our buses.My friend has a 59 single cab(you may have seen it at the
show)which he has a pickup tent in the bed.So you can even camp in a
singlecab.
    Anyway, if need help with anything give a hollar ! A great part of being
in a club is networking and parts swapping !!

&gt; Hi,
&gt;
&gt; I am new to this list and new the the vintage bus scene, although I have a
&gt; 66 Beetle, 70 Cabrio &amp; a 99 New Beetle already.  Last week I purchased a
&gt; 1955 Single Cab pickup at the MOFOCO show in Union Grove, WI and drove it
&gt; home to Chicago.  It runs great and I plan to use it as a work truck for
&gt; awhile (I buy, rehab and resell properties) and fully restore it in a year
&gt; or two&gt;
&gt; Also, how rare is a 55 pickup and what is the range of prices, before and
&gt; after restoration?  Even in its current state it still turns heads here in
&gt; Chicago.
&gt;
&gt; Thanks.
&gt;
&gt; Paul Leske
