Subject: How do you put clips on 5 lug rims?

I remember quite a while ago on either the vintagvw list or type2 list that
there was a discussion about putting new clips on old VW 5 lug rims.  I can
recall someone stating that a regular pop rivet gun would not do the trick -
that you had to have some special tool to do it correctly.  In a few days,
I'll be receiving a set of 5 lug rims which need the clips replaced and was
wondering if anyone could shed any light on what I'll need to do this
properly?  I'm going to sandblast the rims myself and prep them properly
this time so I don't have powdercoated sand like my last set.  Then it will
cost me a grand total of $100 to have all 5 rims done.

BTW:  I'm posting this to the vintagvw and type2 lists since 5 luggers are
common to both dubbers.  Thanks for helping me get one step closer to
bringing my bus home!
