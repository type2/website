Hello

I am reading all of the posts about tranny oil and I am wondering?  Do I 
have to drain mine?  I used Castrol 85w90 and I read on the back just now 
that it &quot;exceeds GL-5 ratings&quot;   I have a rebuilt  4.12 Rancho trans that I 
just installed.  So I called Rancho And he said that it does not matter as 
long as the oil was 85w90.

So is this an early trans thing that you talking about, or did the guy just 
not know what he was talking about?

thanks
domonic
