Subject: Re:  [VB] M Plate: No Country Code?
To: taylorvw_at_redshift_dot_com, vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

Hey all,

Was looking at my buddy's '66 Kombi tonite and his M Plate doesn't have a
country code on there at all.  I've never seen this before!  Has anyone
else?  What's it mean?
- - ----
my 65 has the same lack of Port/coutry code.  I believe that means home 
market- as in Germany is where it was sold.    How are the M codes for wiring 
and bumpers and speedo?
