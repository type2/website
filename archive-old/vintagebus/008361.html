SUBSCRIBE VINTAGVW to listproc_at_listproc.sjsu_dot_edu

My personal suggestion for a list equivalent to this one for bugs is the
vintagvw list.  There are a lot of knowledgeable folk on that list.  If you
are looking also for the comraderie that is exhibited  here, you will find
it on the vintagvw list.  I've been on that list for 7 years and have met
the same calibur of people through it as I have on the bus list.  That's why
I'm subbed to both. :-)
