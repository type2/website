  I now have at least two inches LESS leg room.  Now for someone
 with normal appendages this would be no big deal.  For me however
 (mostly legs), this is a huge deal.  The upright leg to pedal position
 is even more pronounced  ....I feel like a marionette on strings.....
 On a bright note, I now have an automatic headlight turn off feature.

ya, A  6'4&quot; friend of mine found the previously unused and unknown auto 
headlight shut off in my 61 a couple years ago, while driving.  He didn't 
realise when happened.  It was pretty funny.  The sliding drivers seat does 
give more leg room.   Not being a giant, I find the hump seat very comfy, 
except for the splitting seams on the backrest, but you only notice them if 
you dont have a jacket on, so big deal.
