You all pulled this poor guy's leg so hard it 'most fell off!

Jeff, I have never replaced the muffler bearings in any of my vehicles,
and so far never a problem, 300,000 miles and going strong.  If I find
them, I'll be sure to replace them, but don't count on it!  

The muffler belt, now, is another story, they have to be replaced every
100,001 miles.  IF you don't, the odometer won't turn over properly.

&gt; Just what is a muffler bearing?  I have never heard of this until now.
&gt; Forgive my newness.
