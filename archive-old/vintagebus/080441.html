Subject: Re: [VB] anyone have  L-31 Dove Blue PPG mixing code

I'll second that plug for PPG, it loks great on my 65.   Though their code 
for the blue white is too green, I had to go back and have them remix it.    The 
place I went to had old book with codes in it.   they looked up the colour 
with the L number on the sticker by the M code tag.

The computer's are plugged in for late model stuff only.
A Dupont dealer would be a good place to start--

Once you have that Dupont number--it can be cross referenced to any
paint mfg's codes.

I would suggest PPG using materials too--the best, most durable, and
easiest to work with--
