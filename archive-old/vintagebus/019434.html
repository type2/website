GAry Lavere - LaVere's VW restoration.  I don't know who actually *makes* them,
I'm pretty sure he doesn't.  He used to lurk on the list, so if he's still
lurking, I figgered he would have piped up by now.

&gt; Who/where is LaVere?  We hunted a long time for that little part.  Finally got one, but had to buy the whole (wrong) air cleaner.
&gt; 
&gt; There are differences.  One has straight sides and one has a notch to go around the fresh air to the heater boxes.  I think the straight side one is for stale air heater.  The notched bracket works much nicer on the later fan shroud.
