You know, I have a bunch of pictures of a low-mileage '54 Bus engine Ronnie
owned on my site at:
http://thesamba_dot_com/vw/type2/information/1954.htm
but I still can't figure out what the difference is...

Either that or all my extra early shrouds are '54 only, in which case it's
time to retire.  ;)

It was cool to see it though, I learned a lot.

  There is also differences in the lip and the indentations on the back
of
 the
  shroud, for instance 54 BD only and 55 only, but I was told 55 and up
are
  the same, this is BD 55 and up. I was told and showed this by a BD engine
