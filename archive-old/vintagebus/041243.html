volks,
I have a friend who has a 64 kombi with the stock (?)1500 in it.  The distributor in it looks _really_ big as far as the diameter of the cap.  Alot bigger than my 009.  I have heard talk on the type2 list that the best dizzy for a late bus is the dual vac/mech advance distributors that are in some vanagons.  Could this distributor be similar? Any of you vintage bussers seen an old bus with one of these?
Pmail me with any response.  Thanx much.
