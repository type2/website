Great point John, my bus is my daily driver and I HATE having to park in
parking lots, even for a short time. I could live with myself if my 'new'
microbus got smashed, or even worse stolen.

Jim

&gt; You will never see my '66 Westy  or my 64 convertible sitting in remote
&gt; parking at O'Hare, but my NB is there about 30 per cent of the time. I
don't
&gt; expect to get what I paid for my NB, because when I sell it, it will be
used
&gt; up.
&gt; My NB is an appliance, something I bought for utility and service. The
&gt; aircooled VW's are in a different league altogether.
&gt; I enjoy you guys who drive your buses exclusively, but that's not my life,
&gt; it's yours.
&gt; I'd like to have a new microbus too
