Wow, here in the Nor'east that translate to about, humm, $20K!!  Actually, I
saw a double cab (~'60) in a used lot up in NH. Painted something like indian
red.  From the distance, it looked great, but on closer inspection this Type
II had been spray-painted right over all rusts.  Nice red-painted hole in the
forward rocker...  Anywaze- curiousity and cats, I asked, and it wuz being
offered for only:  $12K.

-A smile on my face, as I drove away in Foo-Neck-Betty, thinking how much $$$
I'm sittin' on toolin' down the road..
