It's funny how you're a fellow die hard enthusiast one time and a weirdo on a 
motorcycle (or in a Jetta in my case) the next.

To ensure my 1966 Bug's survival I had to replace her with something more 
disposable for commuting purposes.  I got a 1984 one owner GLI and the first 
time I saw a Bus on the freeway I pulled up next to them and waved.....they 
didn't even look. Ouch.
