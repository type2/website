&gt;So: it looks like my carb needs the throttle shaft rebushed.  It
&gt;looks like Rimco can do this for $30; any feedback on them or advice
&gt;on alternate vendors?

&gt;when i did this on a 30p1, total cost was $75.

Where'd you have it done?  Was that all they did?  It looks like a
new carb will be $100 to $120.  I can see spending $30 on my current
carb, but I can't really see spending $75.
 
&gt;the main danger is: if the carb is crapped out, rebushing won't fix
&gt;anything but the throttle shaft leak; mine ended up being a $75
&gt;paperweight, as the idle circuit was bad.

At this point I've got to clean the carb anyway.  I might just put
a new gasket kit on it and fake up some temporary &quot;throttle shaft 
seals&quot; with RTV (per a past Bob Hoover post) - enough to put it on
the engine and run it for a bit to see if there is any improvement.
If that improves it markedly, then it's probably time to have the
throttle shaft fixed right.  If it doesn't improve then it might be
time for a carb.

&gt;(btw, carbs USED to be 'tuned' at the factory as a top/bottom unit...
&gt;shaving metal off one or the other to achieve flat mating/best airflow,
&gt;etc, so in theory, switching tops will render the carb less than
&gt;effecient.  have no idea if they still do this).

&quot;Flat&quot; is probably not as important (there is a gasket there) as
&quot;concentric&quot; but I think that's what you meant: there is a smooth
bore all the way down the carb with no &quot;step&quot; or &quot;lip&quot; where the
air horn - main body joint is.
