&gt; I found a 1776, for a good price. Builder claims it's align bored with Mahle
&gt; pistons, rebuilt heads, new push rod tubes, 009 new, gen stand, cooler, 12.5
&gt; lb flywheel, engle 110 cam... I would want to run a stock exhuast and single
&gt; carb, probably my new pict 34. Is it posisble to get that combination to
&gt; function? I would rather not ditch a stock exhuast, and single carb


Yes.  the single carb will need to be rejetted appropriately, but yes.

The larger exhausts and larger intakes allow more airflow....and hence
more power at higher RPM....fact is, a less restrictive exhaust is more
likely to /hurt/ you at lower RPM.

anyway.  Yes.  But only if the carb is rejetted for the larger engine.
