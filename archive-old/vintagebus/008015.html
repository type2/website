&quot;SAM'S CLUB&quot; is Wal-Mart's membership discount warehouse operation.
Visitors can get a free pass for a &quot;trial visit&quot;.

They already have a huge stock of toys, etc., on the shelves, and past
experience has shown that they usually carry most of the items sold at
Wal-Mart.  [In our area there's a Sam's Club and a Wal-Mart on opposite
sides of the same shopping mall complex.]

FWIW.....
