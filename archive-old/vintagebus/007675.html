    Well their ad in the VW Rag said &quot;Available at your local dealer&quot;. If he
can get a contract and make a killing selling racks to VW, best of luck to
him. People have to eat and buy VWs and money talks.
    Maybe we could talk him into having a family member start a new company
that makes the other racks. If he has a deal with VW not to make them, that
doesn't neccessarily mean he can't let someone else do it.

in mudville Casy!  Can anyone comment on the validity of said VW/PIP
deal?
