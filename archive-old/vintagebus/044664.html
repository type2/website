Subject: Re: [VB] What size radial tire ???????

I just picked up some 15 rims that I plan to use on the rear of my 67 bus. 
Currently, I am running 175 70 R14 in front and 175 75 R14 on the rears. 
While cleaning out the shed, I discovered some 205 60 R15 that were 
originally on a Ford Taurus '98. Are these worth a try on the 15 &quot; rims. I 
would save some dollars and is it true that I could actually see a slight 
speed increase from running 15&quot; rims on the rear?
