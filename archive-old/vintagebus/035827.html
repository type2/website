&lt;&lt; I simply sprayed POR15 clear on all inside panels during the restoration.
 It is a non-porous coating - nothing will get thru from that side. Then I

Hi Cal,
The problem again is that there is no primer or paint under those supports
that are welded to keep the sheet metal from flexing.  Unlike the type 1s that
were dipped completely in a high zinc content primer the buses were sprayed
primered.  Resulting in bare sheet metal under those welded supports.  Now the
POR15 by itself probably will not do anything bad by itself, but once you
installed the insulation you made your mistake.  Since most insulation is
porous moisture that condensates inside your bus sheet metal it will get
sponged up by the insulation, once the insulation gets soaked enough it will
start a Chinese water torture downward under the welded supports.  Where the
rust will be fed by the steady amount of moisture that the insulation is
retaining especially in the lowest area of the insulation due to the moisture
following gravity.  Resulting in rust burrowing under your original VW primer
and POR15.  So far tar is the only material that we have been able to find
that repels rust up to an inch or two away from where it is applied.
  Also this R21 insulation is it made for house use?  If so, it is for a
thickness of 6&quot; and since we doubt that you have this thickness between your
panels and the outer sheet metal you have actually dropped the insulation
value of this materal way way below it's rating by crushing it.  Plus by
crushing it you have made it even harder to dry out when it gets wet.  In
house hold use you have to use the insulation in the proper thickness or
suffer the same problem of wasting your time and money doing a bad
installation job.
Really suggest that you reamove the porous insulation, install nonporous
insulation like sheets of foam and tar the ares under them.  If not then at
the very least you should check areas of what you have done every 6 months,
and maybe that way when the rust starts you might be able to reduce or
hopefully stop the rust.     Eric &amp; Barb
