HiMatt,
In the three type 2 parts manuals from APR58 to mid 70s we can not find those 
numbers!  Best way to check if they are 40HP it to make sure the intake holes 
are the same size and alignment.  Not really a good idea to mix heads with 
differant part numbers on same engine.  If you do one has to cc the head 
chambers and then grind alot of material off one or the other to get them to 
match.  Even with same part number haeds this is required, but with differant 
part number heads it most likely will be a huge differance.   Eric&amp;Barb
