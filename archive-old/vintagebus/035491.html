Subject: WTB: Ladder that hangs on drip rails
Content-type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII

I saw and purchased such a ladder (a repro) a few years ago at a SOTO meet,
and found it valuable to access my roof rack etc. It hangs on the drip rail,
either in back with a padded curve that rests on the rear bumper, or on either
side with the padded curve going inside the wheel well and onto the rear tire.
Great design, but mine fell off my bus on an errand through town through my
inadequate tie down design. I would like to buy another. any leads anyone.
