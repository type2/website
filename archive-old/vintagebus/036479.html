Subject: Re: [VB] Cyl. 3 &amp; 4 not firing well

Hi Pete,
Best to remove that head and inspect for cracks between the spark plug holes 
and the valve seats.  Especially since it is a DP head and doubly so if it is 
a stocker one with the thin casting in the spark plug area!  If no cracks 
then check the head to intake manifold sealing surfaces for flatness and no 
gouges/scratches.  Use flat gasket material not the flimsy tin stocker seals! 
 Then reinstall the head, retoque all the engine and head fasteners and give 
it another try.
Personally we hate DP heads and stock intake manifold and think SPs produce 
better lower torque which is more important than high RPMing HP for the bus.
