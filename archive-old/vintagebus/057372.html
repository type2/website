Subject: Re: painting vintage knobs

  I would guess that your knobs are ABS, but without 
burning it, it is impossible to know for sure!
  ABS will disolve if exposed to acetone, gasoline, 
benzene, silicone, and ingredients of many paints and 
cleaners. That said, we have painted ABS here with some 
success.  It would help if you clean them throughly and 
rough them up before you paint.

Now that I have my rare original radio knobs for my '63, 
I need to paint =
them. They are badly discolored and stained. I know that 
the wrong paint =
will desolve the wierd protoplastic, so my question 
is...what kind of =
paint should I use to make  them white?
