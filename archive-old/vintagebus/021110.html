Subject: Re: [VB] Overreving

How will the new guides be better equipped to handle the higher revs?
I can understand changing the springs -  I recently learned a *VERY*
painful lesson in valve float - an will henceforce keep my engine
rev limited to ~6500.

Are there any lighter valves available?

Sounds like you need a rev limiting rotor, too.

&gt;    Well I found out the problem with my new 1800. I lost the intake valve

&gt; one to the limits of what it will turn. My tach was broken (damn VDO crap).
&gt; My heads are at the machine shop now getting new guides installed and duel
&gt; springs, instead of the single (which are good to 6000 rpm's.  This engine
&gt; will rev to close to 7000 rpm's and I have no problem running it at 4500 for
&gt; short periods and up to 6000 for hill climbs. I am going to install the new
&gt; tach I have to monitor this situation a little better.  I am extremely
&gt; pleased with the performance and the power and once I get a few bugs sorted
&gt; out I should be real happy along with the DD.
