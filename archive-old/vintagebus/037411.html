Lets have a little activism.
VW does not want us to use thier logo thier name, their concept.

I challenge all of you to go to vw_dot_com or equivalent and go to feedback.
Write that letter you know we should write. Pledge that you will not buy a
VW product until they give up searching out domain names using VW or BUG or
Beetle ETC. WE have a right to a name we have leased 30 years ago. We know
that our efforts are only helping. Now is the time to spread the word. Put
language in them about how you could never buy another car by a manufacturer
that is against the people who own thier product. How you will talk to
everyone you know to NOT BUY from a company that forgets about their
consumers.
HOW:
Type VW in your browser. You should get VW_dot_com or some equvilant. Then type
on feedback, or some such. Tell them they are unfair. Tell them you are
setting up a website about how they are unfair. (This has worked for me in
resolving problems from other manufactureres). Be honest and straight
forward about your opinions. (NO HATE MAIL).
I see this as the only way. You think HOT VW, VW Trends, or Flat 4 plays a
commision to VW? NOT. So why are they slamming you and me? Freedom of speach
in America should still be alive in the US. Reporting is media.
