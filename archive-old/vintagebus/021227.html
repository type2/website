&gt; 
&gt; I would add:
&gt; -  potential loss of pickup tube and oil starvation!
&gt;    Since whoever built John's motor neglected to
&gt; install
&gt;    such basic cooling components as air deflectors,
&gt; do
&gt;    you think they took the time to properly install
&gt; this
&gt;    sump?? 
I thought the &quot;air deflectors&quot; (pieces of tin that are
secured to the bottom of the cylinders) where found on
Type3's orginally and had to be added to the other
types. If that tin is original he never had it to
begin with. The picture is bad but i do see the lower
tin that attaches to the case and heater box.   

&gt; -  cost of sump, cost of additional oil at every oil
&gt;    change

At less than $2 a quart, and purchase price of about
$30 for the sump i would say cost is minimal.    

&gt; -  Oil leaks where the sump mounts

Blame the mechanic not the sump.

&gt; -  risk of some road debris shearing it off
Possible but not very likely unless you lower your
car, and why would you do that anyway. :)
 
&gt;   Didn't Kyle have an engine grenaded by one of
&gt; these??
&gt; mounting nut sucked into pickup or somesuch?
I have never heard of that before. It is possible but
it sounds like a poor assembly job to me. Key word
LocTite!
&gt;   If you have a hot rodded, non-stock motor you may
&gt; need
&gt; extra oil capacity as the oil could be pumped out
&gt; faster
&gt; than it can return to the sump. I run a mild 1776,
&gt; don't
&gt; run high revs and check the oil level at every fill
&gt; up.
&gt; For my situation the risks and added cost outweigh
&gt; the 
&gt; benefits, YMMV
I run a stock 1600 in my bus with a full flow system
and heavy duty oil pump. It's a system that has never
let me down. 
By the way if anyone needs a sump i can be reached at
www. iLOVEVWsumps_dot_com, just kidding. I just think they
are worth the money.
