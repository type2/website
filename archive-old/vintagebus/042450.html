Subject: 61 bus progress report... (long)

hi all,

Thought i would let everyone know how my quest on the 61 is going... I got
A LOT done this weekend... I worked on it like all day saturday and sunday
(like 10 am to 10 pm...)

All brakes are now reassembled.  I had to trim the MC pushrod as early
busses had a different master cylinder than the ones currently available.
I wacked about 12-15mm off of it.. then chucked it up in a drill and got
it spinning and put the end of it to my grinder and made it nice and round
just like the original...  I used the drill so i wouldn't make any flat
spots.

Also my front outer bearings were a little blued... So i bought new.
Local VW flaps had chineese bearings for $5.95, Autozone had Timken US
made bearings for the same price, so i went with the american ones.  I
think my front beam must be very low mileage as the original grease seals
and bearings were in there, and in good shape.

Found a complete set of used 205/75 15 tires... and they are narrower than
most i've seen, yet just as tall... almost 100% tread... score! i love
used tire stores.  They had lots more to choose from just not any other
matched sets, and no truck tires... My 71 had truck tires the first 10k
miles or so then i went to passenger car tires, i never really noticed all
that much difference... maybe a tad squirrelier in crosswinds, but that 
only matters driving through oklahoma in a windstorm (been there, done
that) but i dont regularly load my bus up with a 1 ton payload... and its
well within the weight ratings of the tire.

So anyway, i packed the bearings with redline synthetic grease... its a
pretty red color.. had to take off the right front drum and reinstall
(didnt have to repack though) , as i forgot to tighten the brake lines in
there and spewed brake fluid all over my new shoes :(  This angered me so
i used a trick i learned (from hoover i think) Soak the brake shoes in
gasoline... then light em on fire... this dries them out... worked a charm
for me anyway (move the shoes well away from your tin of gasoline, and if
you blow yourself up its not my fault.  Use your own judgement as to
safety of above procedure.)

Oh, and i used one of those bearing packers that looks like 2 plastic
cones with a piece of hollow allthread down the middle with a grease
nipple on the end.  This pushed out some grease in the bearings i reused,
and i thought i had em perfectly clean.  I like that tool and will
definitely use it a lot.

The brake pedal goes pretty far before it grabs, i might have a couple
more air bubbles, but i cant imagine i do... i bled a whole large bottle
of brake fluid through there... Maybe am used to the pedal travel on my
71? Perhaps non-power assit brakes just have more travel???

So anyway, now my brake system is back together, i have tires, so all
thats left before i can take it off the jackstands is to fix the
accelearator pedal linkage and do a tad more underbody POR15, and rehook
the parking brake.. grese the clutch cable...

On to the engine now... The last one i built i did in a weekend, and its
gone 60k so far...  Think i'll be a tad more careful this time, mebbe
make/buy a deck height and CC tool.  Do the math. 

and to electrics... make sure all doodads and geegaws work to make it
legal.

Oh and i have to fix the shifter. Had a coupler on backorder (for the
front) for like a month now... i was told they have it and its on its way,
so that should be in place by next weekend...

I even got a stereo that fits in the dash from a junkyard.  Its a JVC (all
busses with aftermarket stereos seem to have one of these..) but it
appears to work and has a line out to power my way kewl subwoofer... (i
paid a lot for the woofer and its been sitting unused in my garage for
like 2 years. time to thump, hehe)

well, thats all i can think of... 

take care,

Steve
