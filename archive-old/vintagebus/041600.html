&gt; Hello
&gt; 
&gt; I have ask before, and I'm confused.....
&gt; 
&gt; I have bought a 12 Gas Heater, the problem is that my bus only are 6v.
&gt; 
&gt; Can I change the generator and the starter to 12v and keep the rest of the
&gt; bus in 6v ????

Only if you dont want anything else in the bus to work.

A 12v generator (and regulator) will overcharge your 6 volt battery, with
explosion as a possible result.  The 6 volt battery will not start your
bus with a 12 volt starter (you need a 12 volt flywheel, an adaptor
bushing, and to open the bellhousing up to fit a 12 volt flywheel in order
to use a 12v starter).

You will burn out your coil, dash lights, head lights, parking lights,
wiper motor, radio (if any), inteiror lights, tail lights, your flasher
relay, and possibly your headlight relay with that 12v generator as well.

So, the answer is no.

Some people have had success using 2 6 volt batteries in series ( + - +
-), and charging with a 12v generator (tap all 6v power off of the second 
batery, all 12 off of the first, using the same grounds). I tried it, and
found that the second battery in the series only gets about 5.7 (memory) 
volts in this case, which is not enough to keep it at full capacity.

I suspect that if you DID use a 12v starter, you would be able to pull
starter voltage off of the 12v side (using, of course, a large enough
cable between the 1st neg, and the second positive), and perhaps have
better luck.  Or the total system voltage may continue to hang a bit low,
and you'd always have starter trouble.  I dont know.

Its much easier to just convert to 12v if you need to run 12v acessories
that draw decent current. (I ran my stereo off of a seperate 12v battery
that i had to charge every few days for a few months...I could only get
about 6-7 hrs at the most out of it before i lost power....That just
doesnt work for long trips.)

good luck.

later...david (complete with no wiper motor, and two fresh air holes in
the nose..)
