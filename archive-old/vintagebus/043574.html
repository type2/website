&gt;I guess it is time to get interesting.

OK.  This will probably get very interesting indeed.  :)

&gt;I did find that my flasher relay was not working properly so
&gt;i replaced that.  [...]  When the key is OFF and the turn sig
&gt;(TS) and Emergency relay (ER) are off the dash turn signal light
&gt;is on.  Brightly on.  If i turn the key to ON and leave the TS
&gt;and ER off then the dash turn dignal light goes OFF.

Very interesting.

My initial thought was that the turn signal indicator bulb in the
speedo was connected wrong - one side directly to ground instead
of +12v.  But if that was the case, turning on the ignition
shouldn't make any difference - the turn signal bulb would be
on all the time, key off or on, and it would only flash off when
the turn signals or hazards were on.

Question: What is the part number of your new flasher relay? 
It is probably a 3-digit number.

Also, are your oil pressure and generator lights working OK?
Even if you don't have an engine in, you can check by grounding
the wires to the body back in the engine compartment.

&gt;I metered the wire from the flasher to the dash TS light.  It 
&gt;is providing a constant +12V when everythign is off.

I'm not sure that this is right but I'll leave it for now.
Are you sure you have the wires hooked up to X, L, and P on
the flasher in the way that I mentioned?

&gt;I also checked the #15 wire from the ignition to the dash pod.
&gt;It is at +.3V when the key is off and +12V when it is on.

+12v for on is right, but that +0.3v when off is VERY interesting!
To me, this means that that #15 wire is being grounded through
some other component.  If the turn signal bulb is 1.5W, this
means the resistance to ground is about 2.4 ohms or so.

The way the Bus is wired, with the ignition off, your gas gauge,
oil pressure light, and generator light are all in parallel
between #15 and ground.  If the points are closed, your coil is
also in parallel with all this; if the points are open your
coil is in series with your condenser and these two are in
parallel with all this.  If you happen to step on the brake,
your brake lights are in parallel with all this too.  All of
these things in parallel provide a ground path for that turn
signal light bulb.  I really don't know what the resistance
of all this stuff is, but if it's as low as 2.4 ohms normally,
this might be the problem.

Here's how to tell for sure.  Go back to the engine compartment
and disconnect the hot wire to the coil (the one that doesn't
go to the distributor), the electric choke wire, and the pilot
jet wire (if so equipped).  Also disconnect the oil pressure
light wire and the generator light wire (the skinniest wire at
the regulator, usually blue).  Don't let any of these wires
ground out on anything.  Up front, disconnect the gas gauge
(I think you said yours was already disconnected) and pull
the brake lights fuse - the second from the right.  Now check
the turn signal indicator light again.

If it's still on, then #15 is shorted to ground someplace -
either in the wiring or at the ignition switch.  If it's off,
and you know that all the things you disconnected were working
OK the last time you checked, then that may be &quot;the way it is&quot;
with the flasher you're using.  A &quot;plug in&quot; solution is to use
a #559 flasher, which has four terminals like the original VW
flasher.  Another option would be to re-wire the dash indicator
bulb.  Disconnect and tape off the #15 wire at the turn signal
indicator bulb.  Run a new wire from the newly-freed terminal
on the bulb socket to the terminal with two black/white+green
wires on the turn signal flasher.  *That* should get it.

Please make sure that everything else is in order before 
re-wiring.  In particular, make sure that your oil pressure
and generator lights are working, and that the wires are
connected correctly to the flasher terminals (L, P, and X)
per my previous post.  The reason why I am hesitant to
recommend the re-wiring is that my '64 has a non-stock 3
terminal flasher and its turn signal indicator doesn't
stay on.

&gt;PS.  You were right with the 65 only stuff.  My system
&gt;as a whole is electrically the same as the 63/65.  My
&gt;re-wire kit from wire-works was for 65 only.  If i
&gt;remember correctly, that was because of the physical
&gt;location of some of the electrical parts and how the
&gt;wire were routed.

That makes sense.  Cool!
