Isnt there also a bent alternaor version of the linkage?

&gt; He needs one of the spacers to lift the carb up an inch or so, or
&gt; one of the 211 manifolds which is offset to the left.

&gt; &gt; His problem is this. He built up a 1641DP engine to put in the bus. He put

&gt; &gt; PICT carb, bus seems to have some interference with the altenator. I  think 
&gt; &gt; he said it was the linkage or something.
