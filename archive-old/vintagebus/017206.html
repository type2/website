It looks like we all agreed in a 'round abouts sort of
hem-hawing, not directly, beating the bush, not
succinct, sorta circumspect, scuffing at the dirt, aw
shucks, over the shoulder sideways glancing,
gentleman's reach around granting kinda way. 
GET TO THE POINT ELLIS!!!! 
&lt;Gadzooks, I love teasing the list~  &gt;... ROTFLMAO

Buying the Bentley and your own tools is definitely
the way to go. This brake job will not be the last
time that you need to work on the bus, refer to a
manual or desire help from other VW bus-heads. Meeting
JP, Barry, or any of the gentle hoodlums in
Albuquerque is a good thing. Ordering parts from
Ronnie at oldvolks_dot_com or Jon Furst at Foriegn Aid
(Albuquerque) is also a good thing. Best bet is to get
someone with experience to supervise as *you* do it
the first time. Then you will gain experience. Not
doing it yourself keeps you in the dark forever. 
Time and/or health is another factor. If you don't
have either then paying someone else to do it once in
a professionally expedient manner and getting on with
other aspects of life is sometimes well worth the
costs. Been there too.
What the hell am I saying?! Bring it to me and let me
do it for $700.00-800.00. &lt;plus parts and core
charges.&gt; ;-)
