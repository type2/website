This is a really cool idea, but don't forget about your neighbours to the
North! Let's make it International.

&gt;Anyone know how much those instant polaroid cameras cost?  Maybe we could
&gt;all chip in and buy two of them to be passed from bus to bus (heck, use the
&gt;cameras as the baton).  That way, 1 or 2 pictures could be taken of the
&gt;participant and their bus for each leg of the rally and passed along.  Maybe
&gt;a diary book too.  Then at the end we could have the pics scanned in and
&gt;posted to a web site along with the diary entries from each participant.
