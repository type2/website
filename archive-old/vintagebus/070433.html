&gt; I've got a couple questions.  First, how do I know if my wheel cylinders are
&gt; bad or not?  I'm having to replace my master cylinder, and am not sure
&gt; whether to replace the wheel cylinders while I'm at it or not.

Hi Andrew,
If they leak they are at least bad enough to take apart inspect for pitting 
of the bore and seal damage/failure and possible cleaning and reassembly.  We 
take apart all brake cylinders apart when new to us VW arrives or we replace 
our brake shoes or when 30,000 or three year have past.  This allows us to at 
least clean out the cylinders which are often starting to sludge up by then.  
Polish the bores with 400-600 grit wet/dry sand paper.  Change the brake 
fluid which otherwise will become too high of water content which will cause 
the brakes to vapor fail if they heat up enough and/or will corrode the 
cylinder bores if left in there long enough.

  Second, the &gt; hinge pin on my gas pedal keeps coming out of the hinge, how 
&gt; is the pin supposed to be secured in?  

By leaf spring-Accelerator pedal push rod 211 721 619 which should be 
illustrated in the bus parts manual in among the &quot;Obsolete Air Cooled 
Documents&quot;.  Which spring/locks into the narrowed part of the pedal push rod 
to keep it from sliding from side to side.
Kind of like the 211 721 617 (Hmmmm!  Also a bus part number!!!) 
Spring-Accelerator pedal push rod, in the bug parts manual we have. That 
locks the rod in a simular way, so probably using a type I coil spring 
instead of a leaf spring will do the same job in a bus.
