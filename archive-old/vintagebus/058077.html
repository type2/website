Subject: &quot;Schlepping&quot; a transaxle

I've gotta move a complet transaxle. It's in the barn and I need to load it 
to my little trailer to bring it up to the house. I've had my wife help 
move them before, but frankly these things are heavy as sh*t and I always 
feel guilty. Plus, I don't like the trauma it seems we're putting the units 
through just trying to get them from &quot;a&quot; to &quot;b&quot;.

I've seen the cradle that you can make for your jack to help install them, 
and it makes sense you could roll one around. Mine's located in a non 
&quot;ideal&quot; location. The floor jack I've got won't roll around in dirt and 
hay. And even if it did, I wouldn't be able to manuever through the junk 
around it right now.

Has anyone ever made a dolly or carrier of any sorts to just move them 
around on? I'm thinking for today I'll get a real long steel pipe that I've 
got and tie the tranny and axles to it so it kinda hangs underneath. That 
way me and the wife can get on each end and lift it and move it out of 
there without having to wrestle to hold onto it and end up bending things 
the way they shouldn't go. Picture the cartoon where the natives are 
carrying Elmer Fudd hanging upside down from a long stick tied by his hands 
and feet. You get the idea.

In the future I hope to make a cradle out of a saw horse with casters on it 
to sit the transaxle assembly on and be able to roll it out of the way in 
my shop. Anybody else got any creative ideas or inventions they want to share?
