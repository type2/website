&gt; Just got off an email to all NEATO BOD's and stated my views. Had to write
&gt;the list to calm myself down and explain to some of the new listies my offer
&gt;to Thom . The deal was I challenged Thom to drive one of his buses down to
&gt;the Classic and I would pay his gas one way. I knew all along  it was a no
&gt;brainer for me as Thom never drives his buses over 100 miles either way. But
&gt;I had to put the carrot out there. I couldn't make the offer to any other
&gt;listies as I knew they all drive their buses everywhere and I would lose the
&gt;gas money.
