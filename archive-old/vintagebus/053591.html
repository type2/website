Subject: Re: [VB] trailering a bus

must depend on the dealer, I think most states require it be registered but
vary on inforcement. fwiw I've rented dollies in Calif.,Oregon and British
Columbia, all they've ever cared about is the tow vehicle and what I'm
towing, just tell em I'm towing a bug and they go away happy.

&gt; Really a good point, here in KS, if ANY of the wheels are on the ground,
&gt; the vehicle must have tags (could be temporary) and insurance.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; &gt;Howdy,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;On the subject of the tow dollies, beware.  I had one
&gt; &gt;reserved when in Tucson, and once we got there, they
&gt; &gt;asked for the license # of the vehicle being towed.
&gt; &gt;Since it was not currently registered and consequently
&gt; &gt;had no plates, they said it could not go on a dolly,
&gt; &gt;that it had to have all the wheels off of the ground.
&gt; &gt;So my only option was to go with the AT.  Thanks a
&gt; &gt;lot, Uhaul.
