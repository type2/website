&gt; Anyone seen the new VW commercial for the New Cabrio?  It shows 4 people (2
&gt; guys and 2 girls) cruising at night with the top down.   The moon, stars,
&gt; and bus are out and they seem to be enjoying themselves.  As they arrive at
&gt; the party location, they sit and a look at each other and then there is a
&gt; fade-out as the driver's side reverse light comes on.  It shows them out
&gt; cruising again - message being that they'd rather cruise then party.
&gt; 
&gt; The background music is a soft accoustic piece.  Anyone know the name or
&gt; author of it?

Nick Drake, the song is Pink Moon.  You can check out the whole commercial
here:

and you can even buy the CD from the site.

Laters!
