&gt; So what's your stock-looking antenna setup? What
&gt; sort of mounting?  Where
&gt; is it mounted, if not right front?

Joe,

Here' a picture of my '59 Westy w/ Safari's and it's
over-the-emblem antennae-

And here's a picture of my '61 Flipseat Westy w/ it's
single mount antennae-

The best thing is, the first 10 listees who want one
of these single mount antennae can get one from me for
reimbursment of postage.  If you're going to drill
holes in your bus, this is the antennae mount to get
(for free).  Bus-snob Jon (Hazetguy) Furst left me a
box of these the other day, and I thought I'd share. 
The mount comes with the Chrome deal, 2 nuts to mount
it, an antennae cable, and an allen wrench (not sure
what that's for).  You have to buy the antennae itself
w/ the adapter (says for Chrysler cars),but I'll be
glad to send you the chrome mount!
