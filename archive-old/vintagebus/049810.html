Subject: Need starter diagnosis...

So my wife went to drive the bus and it just clicked, no start. It clicked
at me last time I'd had the engine out, two weekends ago, but I cleaned up
the connections and it seemed okay.

This time I can't get it to work. I have cleaned everything shiny clean,
all connections including the hard to reach ones. I've tried two different
ground straps. Battery measures 12.5 volts with a voltmeter.

PO put a Ford solenoid on, could that be it?

At this point I'm thinking it's the starter. Banging on the starter didn't
help. I can pull the starter out of the disabled 68 and put it in, but
that's going to take all night so I'd rather not if I don't have to. Any
suggestions on short notice?

Thanks,
