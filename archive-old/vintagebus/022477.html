When you say b/d do you mean barndoor?

The barndoor reduction boxes are different than &quot;normal&quot; ones, as are the
spring plates.

The center sections (the transmission itself) are interchangeable, but the
mount from a pre-59 1/2 bus needs to be matched to the same type of
nosecone, unless you get one of those adapters from wolfgang.  To do this
conversion you need a later nose cone *without* a reverse light.  Ask me
how I know.

I don't know about the interchangability of the rear-end components.  I'm
going to guess they are not compatible.

&gt;  Can a late 3:88 freeway flier trans be put in a b/d? Will the b/d axles
&gt;fit in a later trans?
&gt;Will the nose cone and hockey stick work or will the front mount have to be
&gt;modified to fit later trans? I would like to run a stock 1600 and later
&gt;trans but keep reduction boxes. Is this imposible? Is the b/d trans the only
&gt;1 that will work with reduction boxes? I would like to have a b/d that sits
&gt;stock but can run freeway speeds on long trips.  Shoot me if you want, but
&gt;it will be another b/d on the road.
