Hey Y'all,
I wanted to pass this deal on to everyone on the list.  I REALLY wanted to buy this bus simply because I felt it was too good of a deal to pass up, but I already have a 66 and my wife &quot;reminded&quot; me that what I really need is a winter driver with good heat (damn Ohio winters!).  Anyway, it's a 65 in Waterville, Ohio (a Suburb of Toledo) that the owner says runs great, &quot;drive it anywhere&quot;. Pix are on Everett's site, search using the word &quot;waterville&quot; in location entry.  It actually looks relatively solid, and he says it runs GREAT.  Here's the kicker: HE'S GETTING FRUSTRATED TRYING TO SELL IT AND SAYS THAT IF NO ONE BUYS IT SOON, HE'S GOING TO CHOP THE TOP OFF AND MAKE A CONVERTIBLE!!!!  His asking price is only $1750 and I get the impression he would be willing to negotiate.  Please contact him, and not me regarding this, his email address is:  my49vw_at_yahoo_dot_com
  With his frustration level, he asked that only serious minded inquiries be made! Somebody please save this bus from being desecrated!!!!!


Peace, John Baker
