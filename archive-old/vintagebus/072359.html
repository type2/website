Subject: Re: [VB] Friday Rant .............. only my first for today.

When I was selling my last VW, several people emailed messages like this:
&quot;$3000, I will pick it up.&quot; That's it - no name, no questions about the
vehicle.
------------- Clip -------------
I made my concessions .......... 1/2 of their airfare to come buy, a
bonus of new and good used spare parts, thrown in the 12v/120v/Battery
powered TV, replace a few items that worked but took &quot;that special touch&quot;
to operate, complete pre delivery service of wash, interior detail, wax,
oil change etc. etc.
I offered exactly all the things that nobody ever offered to do for me on
a car sale.
I have discouraged anybody from purchasing any of my vehicles without
being here, driving them and fully checking them out.
I have absolutely no doubt that every car, truck, van that I've ever sold
would make it 3000+ miles without any problems if they weren't just run
into the ground.
I'm waiting on a guy that called at 12:00 noon and said he'd call back in
15 minutes. That is 2 hours I could have spent better elsewhere.
