&lt;&lt; I have a pile of clamps, base plates and T bolts but I don't know how many
 and what parts to use.
 
 short or long t bolts, with or with-out the nipple, 2 or seat base plates if
 any at all, etc. etc., 
  &gt;&gt;
Can't say how many should be on there, but the clamps with nipples are for 
buses with holes drilled in the seat legs(bay windows?). I think the short 
bolts are for the rear seat since no mat goes underneath it. not sure about 
that though.
