So what you are saying is:  Isn't it peculiar how folks who own, and 
therefore have an intimate knowledge of, and years of experience of camping 
with, and have a greater overall knowledge of, Like the Puck and find it to 
be great addition to our enjoyment of the VW Hobby.  Your point would be 
what?  

As far as value, neither Cowboy Jim E., nor Rchase, nor myself have our 
Puck's for sale so current value would mean what to us?  Any figures 
presented were purely historical, not speculative.  

If you don't like them, fine.  Don't buy one.  But your approval isn't 
prerequisite to someone else wanting one or enjoying the one they have.
