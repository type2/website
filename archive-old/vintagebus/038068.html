Subject: Re: [VB] Gas Heater Seminar update
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

I went to look at an old treadle sewing machine for sale the other day and 
came home with a 12v bn-4 and a tow hitch for the single cab. At one point I 
had a list of sites saved that where dedicated to gas heaters of various 
makes and what made them work but when I sent in my computer for repair it 
came back empty, if some one could point me to some of these site or a list 
of links, It would be most helpful.
thanks
