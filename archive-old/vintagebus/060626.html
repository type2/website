&lt;&lt; ..I know the feeling. I have been going through this
 myself. Check your lug-nuts, reduction box mounting
 bolts and you clutch. If all is well it is probabily
 an internal problem. That is what I have decided the
 problem is with mine.

 &gt; So I've been getting a knocking/rattling sound when
 &gt;  I disengage the
 &gt;  clutch under a load (i.e. when starting up a hill).
 &gt;  After consulting
 &gt;  with Muir and FLAPS, I decided it must be a busted
 &gt;  front tranny
 &gt;  mount. It looked OK from under the bus (a 64
 &gt;  deluxe), but I figured
 &gt;  they knew more than I did. Anyways, I just spent
 &gt; the
 &gt;  last 2 days
 &gt;  pulling the engine and tranny, putting in the new
 &gt;  mount and putting
 &gt;  everything back together again. Just gave it the
 &gt;  first test drive
 &gt;  and it sounds pretty much exactly how it did before
 &gt;  I started.
 &gt; 
 &gt;  Any ideas?
