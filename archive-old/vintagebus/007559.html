 Didint think it was as bad as ronnie said. Got a rear slash bumper with
brkts and splash guards for $75, a barndoor rear spare tire panel for $25,
and 20 doghouse
coolers with adapters for $20 for all 20. Could have bought 2 16&quot; wheels
with 4 trim
rings for $100 but passed on them. A lot of sellers and few buyers. They
also cought
some guys selling stolen VW parts, I say lock em up and through away the
key. See
you all at BBB3 in jan 99. If you need a flier email and I will send one
right out to you.
