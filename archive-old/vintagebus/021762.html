&lt;&lt; I don't think an 8-track will fit in a '66 radio hole without serious
 hackage. Too wide, you know. The Sapphire VIII in the '67 is different,
 monstrous radio orifice you know. &gt;&gt;
Hi Volks,
Agreed that the radio hole in pre1967 buses is too small for 8 track.  Both
Clara and us have found Pioneer 8 track players.  Apparently this model was
only made for one year and the next year was converted into a cassette player.
Along with playing 8 track tapes it has a FM feature, but no AM.  Plus it is
made to bolt under the dash/package tray, so you probably could have a AM,
AM/LW, or AM/SW radio in the dash and the 8 track/FM bolted under the tray.

I was told this was the top of the line 8 track player.    It has quite good
sound, I should get better speakers.       I didn't know you guys found one
too.  Last summer I saw a bay window with the same big dial Pioneer with a
cassette player, I think the 8 track version was 1978 only.   Mine is attached
under the dash tray in my 61 m130 deluxe.      It even has fast forward and
eject.   yeee haw.   I have a radio block off plate in the dash, though it is
from a junkyard and a slightly different level of faded sealing wax red than
the dash.   I personally think it all looks nice.
