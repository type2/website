Subject: Re: [VB] stuck drum again

Yes, this is how I do it too. Make sure the tongues of the shoes are
seated in the slots of the cylinder ends. Then fold the rubber seal
forward and around the cylinder body, making sure that they fit and seal,
all the way around as well.

Good call Clara! It's the kind of detail that I just take for granted.

&gt; ****hm, looking at the pic some more, I am thinking the left shoes where it
&gt; goes into the top whel cylinder looks funny.  Peel back that dust cover
&gt; carefully and make sure the end of the shoe is in the slot in the wheel cylinder
&gt; piston***
&gt;
&gt;  Because of this being easy to do, I usually put the shoes on with the dust
&gt; covers on the shoes (not the cylinders), peeled back inside out sort of, so I
&gt; can see it go into the cyliner right, then pull the dust cover back onto the
&gt; cylinder with a little screwdriver, making sure it is settled on all sides.
