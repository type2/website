Subject: this is about a bay window.
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

i have been looking at a 79 bay window bus lately. i
am doing so because i want to sell my car (to get out
of debt) and buy a nice, perfect bus with the
remainder of the money. i was thinking either that, or
a jeep to tow busses around with. but i think i'd
rather have a bus. so anyway...

this bus is a 79 with a 20k rebuilt motor. i think
it's a champaign edition. it is is very nice shape,
but it still has no heat, the pop top canvas has a few
small holes and tears, the windscreen seal leaks at
the bottom (not a big deal to me), and the fuel guage
only works for the first 100 miles. but those are the
only things wrong with it. it is complete, you can
talk at normal conversational tones, and you can go 70
mph. i deffinitely want a functional camper bus. i
guess what i want to know is what to look for as far
as what wears out first, warning signs of major
repairs and such. it is a 4 speed manual 2.0 litre
with a catalytic conv. any real suggestions would be
mucho appreciated.
