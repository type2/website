Subject: RE: [VB] Paint - Mango Green / Seagull Grey

Thank you for the heads up. I will talk to my LAME PPG dist. tomorrow. They
carry OMNI (JUNK!!!)  which is a urathane, I personally like enamals much
better, but that is just me.

ronnie

of course if there Valu-Pro is as good as there OMNI I would AVOID it

It says they are a division of PPG.

[...]

&gt;   I have talked to all the paint suppliers we have here and none of them
&gt; have ever heard of Valu Pro paints (there is one supplier in Phoenix of
this
&gt; brand). One suggested that it is made by Val-Spar a low end paint
&gt; manufacturer. It is not made by DuPont, PPG or Sherwin Williams.
