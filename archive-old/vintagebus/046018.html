replacement as is used to replace the taillight after the fact, say sometimes 
later when a taillight got cracked and gets... replaced.  The euro flat glass 
taillight with the screws on the inside of the engine compartment are 
functionally the same as the barndoor taillights (fit and attach exactly the 
same, electrical connection ditto)  and I believe that they were sold at 
dealerships to people with broken taillights on their barndoors.    

For your 57 I don't think this would be the case, the euro lights have only 
the one screw terminal - taillight only, and not two, which the N Am 
taillights have for taillight and also for turn signal.  If your 57 has 
semaphores, then it only needs the one connections and of course the euro 
spec lights would be correct.

 What do mean &quot;replacement&quot; lenses?  I just got a set of the lenses on the
 right for my '57 Standard and was hoping that they are correct.

 &gt; People do sell the ones on the right as &quot;Barndoor&quot; as they technically 
could
 &gt; be considered &quot;replacement&quot; lenses.  They are incorrect.
