Subject: Re: [VB] Berg Shifter?

Hi All -

I've used a Berg shifter in my '71 bay since 1982 - one of the best 
investments I put into it.  The faster more positive shifting, with the 
sturdy T handle close at hand is part of the fun in driving.  I must say 
that the added power of the low compression stroker motors I've run in 
Betsy since then are part of the package.   I've ordered one for the '61 
single cab and expect the same good result.

Adrian asked:
 &gt;.... Is anyone running a Berg bus shifter?....

Then Eric said:
I ran a short shift kit and a shift extension in my 66 westy, and it worked
great.  I heard someone say once that it doesn't work/cant be done, but it
worked fine for me.  A Berg shifter is nice, but overkill in a bus IMHO.
