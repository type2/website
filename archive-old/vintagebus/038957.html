So a pressure washer might get the 'art' off? You know, if they are signed
by Jerry, you probably get a mint for the 65(66?) and just restore the mango
one? That way 50% of the hippie world is happy, and you got a minty pre 60?
I just think that it is memoriablila and an expression, a canvas. AS I said
before to each their own bus, maybe since they are so changed from your
ideal that you could let one stay that way? It's ultimately your business of
course, and I do not intend to tell you otherwise, just offer a curious
option. I would be inclined to make em as they rolled off the floor too (as
I unlower a bus and try to find OEM shocks,and mouse grey trim insert
molding (anyone?), for my lotus/lotus white dlx) , but if I would up with a
a 356 signed by janis j., for example,  I might just leave THAT one alone.
Enjoy your wonderful find, and best of luck with them both, a truely rare
oppurtunity and an exciting story.

&gt; So were these raffled as a pair by Discover, the winner won BOTH?

As far as I know at the moment ,Discover card never did give them away.
An employee of Discover &quot;got&quot; them and then they donated them to charity.(a
church).
