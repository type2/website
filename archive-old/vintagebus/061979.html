&gt;I've always wondered: the people who take these epic road trips -
&gt;how do they support themselves while on the road for weeks at a
&gt;time?  I have a decent job (for now!) myself, but I can't imagine
&gt;taking 6 weeks off to go fart around the country in a bus without
&gt;pay.
&gt;
&gt;The money for all that gas and oil and food and parts, etc has to
&gt;come from *somewhere*.  Do they just hit a liquor store in each
&gt;town they pass thru?  Rich uncle?  Sugar momma?  Parts whoring?

&gt; &gt; well, the summer shows are calling and it's time to hit the road.
&gt; &gt; approximately 9000 miles in the next 6 weeks in the 59 Westy.
