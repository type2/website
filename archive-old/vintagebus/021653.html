Okay, the title is a bit off. Maybe I should call it &quot;4,382 miles in a 
split&quot;. But this is actually the short version.   

Left Oly.  Drove down I 5 to the bay area, then down to Bakersfield and hung 
a left and out through Arizona, where I did some bus stuff with VW people.   
Then I turned around and drove back.    Pretty much the same route.   There 
is this one hill in so cal,  west of it has grass and trees, the other side 
has dry rocky desert.

All in all I went to 4 VW shows.  was even called a vw show groupie, but I 
think he was mistaken, I'm with the band.   Bought lots of gasoline at 
increasingly high prices.  Lowest was when I left Oly it was 1.3something in 
Chehalis, highest was out in Californias high desert at 2.23 for regular.  
ouch. Went down as I went north, gas in Oregon was about 1.49 for regular.    
my milage varied between 23 mpg and 30mpg, depending on various conditions 
and driving patterns.   

Bus's oil temp was warmer going up long hills well loaded with stuff on roof 
rack in hot dry weather, than in other driving conditions.

Got home Tuesday night.  Bus is semi unpacked.  Good night
