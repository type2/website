How shiny was the beltline and bumper trim originally?
I got my bumper trims looking like chrome with some
0000 steel wool followed by Mother's polish. Too
shiny? 
....- - - - - - 
very shiny.  shiny shiny shiny.    I sed 1000 grit sandpaper fallowed by 
polish.   Probably a good idea to wax it after to keep it nice.  the steel 
wool idea sounds nice.
