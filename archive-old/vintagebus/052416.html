Subject: Re: [VB] Just how fast does your bus go??



&gt; I was going to save this question for Friday, but all these 
discussions
&gt; concerning experiments and Trannys have me wondering about my bus.  
Just how
&gt; fast does your bus go??
&gt; 
&gt; Everybody is talking about cruising down the road at 65 and 70 MPH; 
my bus
&gt; only goes 55-57 MPH (NOT 58+, unless there is a good tailwind and/or 
I am
&gt; going downhill).  I thought I was doing good, but I feel a bad case 
of
&gt; 'speed envy' coming on &lt;vbg&gt;.

One problem with speed quotes (other than ego inflation) is that not 
all speedometers are accurate.  For example, I could say that I cruise 
between 75 and 80 in my '71 (Low compression Mexican 1600 and stock 
transmission), but that is only what the speedometer says.  

The reality, as reported by the GPS, is that I really cruise around 
58MPH.

The older my speedo gets, the more optomistic it is.  I figure in 
another five years I'll have a metric speedometer.
