The link to the photos was included in the original message I posted.  Here
it is again:

The &quot;mini sump&quot; is only slightly larger than the oil drain plate and is
described to have a fine steel mesh that replaces the stock oil screen.

I havent seen the pics of the plate...where are they?

My guess is that it is a windage tray, if it is an airplane.
The formula vee guy who my old shop built engines for used one... it
keeps the oil level during sustained cornering... they were standard in
type4 engines, but never factory in a type1.
