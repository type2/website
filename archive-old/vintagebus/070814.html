Subject: Re: [VB] missing M-code plate

Sorry to make a correction, but it's pre-1959 Buses that don't have the
m-code plate.  1959 and later buses do have it.

&gt; Hi Tom,
&gt; Would help to know what year your bus is.  Pre-1960 buses do not have a
&gt; M-code plate.  The ONLY way to check for proper VIN # is to find it
stamped on the
&gt; body inside the engine compartment just forward and right of the rear
apron.
&gt; While that one could be cut and welded in place, all other VIN #s can be
just
&gt; unscrewed and replaced.
