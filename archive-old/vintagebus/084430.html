Subject: Re: [VB] Wheel question 15&quot; vs. 14&quot; on my 1963

Hi Garrick,

I'm not sure why they decided to go with smaller wheels on the heavier
bus unless they thought the greater weight needed more shock
absorbtion with more rubber, or maybe they thought they could provide
a more economical product with cheaper tires. But according to the
tire article at gowesty_dot_com you get a shorter sidewall with a 15 inch
wheel which they claim is better stability and better handling.

&gt; **after writing most of this message, I double-checked my Bentley

&gt; fitted with 14&quot; tires and the 3/4 ton with 15&quot; (prior to December
&gt; 1963). So apparently I have a 1 ton vehicle, not surprising since its
&gt; a commercial. The same questions remain, however: what are the
&gt; implications if I go to a 15&quot; wheel? I much prefer a narrower look and
&gt; I will not be hauling around 2000lbs worth of anything. Is this
&gt; possible, or do I have to replace more than just the rims?
