Ronnie and the list--

The Firestone Firehawk R45 LTP's in 205/75/15 are the tires I am running and 
I love 'em to death... They fit the wheel wells on my '59 panel well, don't 
let the bus all over the road, and perform very well in rain and highway 
driving... 
They look great with the large black Firestone script (i opted to keep the 
white side on the inner part). I searched for months for tires and these 
were, by far, the best!!!
Look great on freshly powdercoated rims... Now if I could just master my 
hubcap clip problem (ive lost 4 caps in the first week my bus was done).

BTW--they ran me $82.95 a piece plus 24$ for all of them mounted and computer 
balanced! Worth every penny!!!!

TGIF---
