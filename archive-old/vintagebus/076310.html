Subject: Front door pull handles

I'm trying to redo my '65 bus interior (thanks Clara for the help with the
panels!). I don't have any pull handles for my front doors and my favorite
place, WW, doesn't even offer them for sale. I've checked other sites and they
don't have them either.

Are these parts really hard to come by? Should I just do junkin' and try to
find some in good condition?
