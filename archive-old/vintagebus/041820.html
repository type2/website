&gt; Thom, I must agree on the safe bus issue, but Jerome isn't a weekend of
&gt; drunkedness and unsafe buses,I go and I don't even drink!

thinking about it, the last place I'd want to take a bus with questionable
brakes is Jerome!  Those hills are danged steep and unforgiving  I don't
want my trip to turn into a &quot;thrill ride!&quot;
