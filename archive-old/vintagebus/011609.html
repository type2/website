Subject: A Few Good Writers

NEATOites:

Last week there were several threads about NEATO newsletters---or
lack thereof.  There were several suggestions about how to keep
the OBR going and who could edit which edition, etc.

This week is another story.  NEATO members should have the latest
Old Bus Review by now.  As Dave Easterwood states on the front
page of OBR, &quot;Next issue will be a full-size issue and should be
in your hands about 30 days...&quot;

So, let's see some follow-up on last week's idle chatter.  Take
the time now to write something for the next (or next) OBR.  Type
up something coherent, whether it's technical, a &quot;road trip&quot; or
just an old bus story.  Make it something that's not already here
on the Type 2 list.  Many NEATO members don't have Email...but
those who do deserve to read something fresh in OBR.  Proofread
it and Email it to

neato_at_rt66_dot_com

You'll feel better and other NEATO members will feel better.  And
publishing of OBR will get caught up because someone took the
time to submit something.

You'll find some of my writing in this OBR.  And, yes, I have
already forwarded another article for the next OBR.  I'm working
on another.  That's what it takes.
