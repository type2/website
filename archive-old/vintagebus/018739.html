Happy Friday everybody.

This morning I got up early for the usual Friday only
DARTHVW drive to work.

It was abpout 45 degrees here (Los Angeles, by our
standards, pretty chilly - call me spoiled).

Anyway, I put on some pants and a short-sleeved shirt,
since the high is supposed to be mid-70's. My VW
jacket was hanging on the back of my door at work, so
I figured I could tough it out for the 7 mile drive
this early.

Leaving the driveway everything seemed okay until
about one block down the road, the windows started
fogging up, both inside and outside. I pulled over and
wiped 'em down with the towel which serves as my
passenger seat upholstery.

Ten seconds later I was back in fog city. Since I have
no heat hooked up and no wipers (didn't figure I
needed them, since DARTH has no canvas on the sunroof,
I only drive him in 0% chance of rain weather).

Pulling over was getting tedious. Then I realized that
I could open one safari windshield to wipe off the
other one and vice versa. Then the light bulb really
went on: &quot;Heck, just drive with the windshields open!&quot;

I propped the things up just about parallel to the
ground and was on my way. My hands practically went
numb and I was shivering, but at least I could see. I
got there safe and sound, avoiding the freeway. You
should have seen all the crazy looks I got from
people. 

Proud to be a bus owner. 

Jason
