he writ:


I just purchased a 60 microbus (with no seat, yet..) and under the cargo

floor there is a sheet metal that cover the frame underneath!!


is that factory ??  if yes whats the utility ??


in my advice it more a rust nest as it could keep humidity trapped!! no ?


though you did not mention the model of your bus, VW did put a sub floor in 
their buses that came with big holes in the roof (sunroof) and/or cargo doors 
both sides (DD) as structural reinforcements.  This is important for that 
purpose.  Yes it can also rust in there, but did not get rid of them willy 
nilly.   Does your bus have either of those features?
