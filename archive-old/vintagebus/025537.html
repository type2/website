Subject: What year doors can I substitute
Message-ID: &lt;37691FF5.37876EEC_at_fibertel_dot_com&gt;

Hi all,

I have a 65 that I need a passanger side door for and I might have a guy
up in San Jose that has some doors, but I need to know what year doors
will fit.  I believe that the doors from 59 to 67 will fit, but only the
64? to 67 will match as far as handles.  Correct?

Thanks,
Aaron
