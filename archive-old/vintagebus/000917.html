Hi folks,

I've been doing quite a lot of Windows programming at work, and thought I
might write a program for VW's on my spare time (I actually enjoy this
programming stuff!) I'd give it out for free to anyone interested - I'd just
email the setup (installation) program.

I was thinking of a database type program where you could store info on your
cars (I guess this could apply to all cars/motorcycles - wouldn't have to be
VW only, although I like the idea of a VW theme). For each vehicle you could
save: type, model, VIN, engine #, m-codes, license plate #, date purchased,
etc....) You could also keep a maintenance/modification/restoration database
for each vehicle with date, mileage, work performed, cost, etc. Perhaps a
parts needed (wish list) that you could update when a new one came to mind
and print out on your way to the junkyard/swapmeet? Maybe engine tune-up
specs for each vehicle that you could print out on your way out to the
driveway (point gap/dwell, timing, valve clearance, etc.)?

Would this be useful? Would anyone be interested? Is it a little too
geekish? I do like my little log book that I keep in my bus with all this
information. Any ideas for features to include? Plots, charts, photos?

Anyway, just an idea.
