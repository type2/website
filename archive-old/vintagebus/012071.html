&gt; I have only had to do this operation once(I've only had the bus for
a few months). I believe my gaskets were cork, so I replaced them(also
reccomended by Muir.
&gt; 
&gt; The Fel-Pro Neoprene Gasket sounds like a great solution, where can
you get these, should FLAPS have them?

Any FLAPS that carries Fel-Pro should have them or can order them.

The Fel-Pro gaskets have a &quot;wide&quot; section that matches a &quot;wide&quot; gasket
surface on the valve cover.  Some valve covers have a protrusion that
interferes with the wide section of the gasket.  If you have the
protrusion all you need do is cut the wide section off with a razor
blade.  It's a simple straight cut.

I glue the gasket to the (squeaky clean) cover with Fel-Pro yellow
gasket cement (a substance that looks suspiciously like weatherstrip
adhesive).  I use a very thin coat of permatex blue form-a-gasket to
seal between the gasket and head.
