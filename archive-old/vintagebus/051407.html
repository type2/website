Subject: Friday - VW Planet sighting

As I stumbled by the tv yesterday, access hollywood was on, and I saw a
picture of a computer screen enlarged to show the image of a certain
scandalous web site, and underneath, in the task bar, was a link to VW
Planet.  Belated thanks, Everett, for hooking me up with the 65 EZ Camper I
bought in NY last June.  BTW Since its friday, what's the longest anyone on
the list has owned their current bus(es)?  My wife has asked me what would
make me sell either of mine, and I couldn't come up with an answer right
now.
