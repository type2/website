&gt;You guys are scaring me!!

Okay, now you're with us! Scared. Cold? ...but wait, you're not confused and I am.

&gt;First off, if your just going to skin the nose, cut
&gt;the old nose off about a half inch away from all seams with a wheelie cutter
&gt;or nibbler....allow you to undo any of the hemmings flanges...

I don't know what a hemmings flange is. This probably scares you more, but I can learn. Can you recommend a book where I could learn enough to speak intelligently?

&gt;..if it has the pillars, cut the pillars and work
&gt;them out of the hemmings flanges...

Does this mean we won't cut all the way through the pillar?

&gt;               Mr. Bubble Head

...any chance you're kin to Mr. Bubble of the Bubblebath bubbles? I knew him when I was a child.

;) Thanks! Joe
