Hey there Volks, Andre here again. Nothing to add for now but I hope to get
out there and bring my bus home soon. I have problems with my &quot;tow&quot; vehicle
which is still broken in my garage. I'm waiting for parts. Now while I'm
here I would like to repeat my call for help regarding the windshield that
I'll need once I bring this baby home. When I go to Oklahoma I might be able
to pick it up on the way if anybody out there has one. I do have some pieces
of glass for pop-outs, that should also fit regular stationary side windows
too. All the pieces I have have SEKURIT logos. Anybody for a trade? Do you
have one for sale? As soon as my truck gets fixed I'm on my way. It
shouldn't be much longer. Owner of the Bus told me that he doesn't want to
sell it to anybody else. He committed to me, got my deposit so now he
doesn't want to back out on me. Good thing he's waiting this long.

Andre
