&gt;I can't find any solid info on the proper timing of an H5466796 case with
&gt;.009 dist.  Idiot manual claims 0 deg. TDC, but I am reluctant to believe
&gt;it.  Can anyone verify from another source?  7.5BTDC seems much more
&gt;likely.  thanks...
&gt;
A while back I asked this and after much discussion and research and
argument, the answer was 7.5 BTDC.  Why?  Because the 009 provides 21
degrees of total advance and 28.5 is optimal for a stock or near-stock
engine.  The 21 degrees was verified with a dial advance timing light in
order to squash a few &quot;I've forgotten more about Buses than you'll ever
know&quot; losers.

I always thought the stock vacuum advance was better...
