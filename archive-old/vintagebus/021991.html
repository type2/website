Subject: Re: [VB] Stretchy belt...?

Actually a split case tranny has a slightly HIGHer r&amp;p than the 4.375 tunnel 
case tranny.    SO when I get my truck I'll put a split case tranny, and 1.26 
RGBoxs on it.   I just want that full and complete stop to go into first 
feeling again.

 .82 is higher gearing than a .89  It has something to do with division I 
believe.   a .77 4th - which you can get aftermarket, is even higher.  People 
with fat motors sometimes get them.    THe 4th gear, is an overdrive, as it 
is a number smaller than one.  a bug 4th is good for pulling hills, being 
lower, but less speed at the same rpms.   You can put together the bad hiney 
hauling bus with 4.37 and 1.39 rgb, and bug 4th for hauling heavy loads ... 
around town.  Ya you can overrev at 60.  yup.  Get a tach.  forget trying the 
math.   You can just borrow the tach- hooked up but not installed works.  
swap trannys, and tell us how the tach readings change.

&gt;  Not trying to start anything here, but I dearly love a technical 
&gt; discussion.
&gt;  
&gt;  My manuals give a BUG tranny from 1961-67 with a .89:1 4th gear and a BUS 
&gt; tunnel
&gt;  case tranny w/RGB with a .89:1 4th gear. Same/same.
&gt;  
&gt;  In the split case BUS tranny 4th had a .82:1 ratio. But you also ran a 36HP
&gt;  engine. The lower 4th gear was needed to push the bus. The tunnel case 
&gt; tranny
&gt;  will reduce RPMs over the split case tranny.
&gt;  
&gt;  Maybe I'm a little dense, but can you tell me again WHY you feel this is a 
&gt; bad
&gt;  gearing combo and will &quot;OVERREV&quot; an engine at 60 MPH?
&gt;  
&gt;  Can you provide some hard numbers or am I asking to much? VW seems to 
think 
&gt; a
&gt;  BUG tranny with RGBs will work, they sold them for years!

&gt;  &gt; As I said before, if you have a BUG tranny with a BUG fourth, the gearing
&gt;  &gt; may very well be too short. The fourth gear in a bug tranny is fine with
&gt;  &gt; straight axles, but it wasn't intended to be coupled to redux boxes. I've
&gt;  &gt; had this combo on a couple of buses and it ain't good for highway speed.
