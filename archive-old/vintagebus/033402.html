Subject: 67 Panel Buses??
Mime-Version: 1.0

How hard is it to find Panel Buses?  About when I was ready to buy the 66 
Kombi that I ask for opinions on, along came a deal on a Panel Bus.
A guy has a 67 Panel Bus with Bumpers and runs, needs brake work, and is 
driveable.  I haven't seen it yet (it's 3 hours away), but he says the body 
is in good shape except it's been painted with a paintbrush.  He wants $600 
or $650 to deliver.  The price sounds real good, but I don't 
particularly  like Panels.  My think is I may be able to trade it for a 
Kombi that runs or do the repairs and trade it.  What do you think?
