I am 15 years old and just bought a 1967 VW Bus. I got it for $100 bucks from a friend of mine. It needs some work though. The body is all true except for the very front. There is a small dent on the front of the bus kind of in the middle.
Is that repairable? How do I fix it? Can I go to a junkyard and get a new front?

Please e-mail me the answer at lizard_at_gorge_dot_net

Also, I have no idea how to work on a bus, I just love how they look. Are there any good books/internet sites that might help me?

Thanks a lot, 

Gabriel Rowland
