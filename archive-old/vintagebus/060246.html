Oh yeah, those auto loan payments for the $4500 I borrowed to pay for my bus
are killing me...

I personally prefer to get a 2nd/3rd/4th against my house because that's
what the tv commercials tell me to do.  Did you know I can eliminate
$500-$1000/month
in high credit card and auto loan payments?!?  Call now, don't delay,
limited
time offer, the first 10 callers get 1% off our already low rate of 21.95%!
