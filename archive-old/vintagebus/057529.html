&gt; I would have to agree with the I-5 Cali-Oregon border and the I-5 Grapevine:
&gt;   Same trip from Corvallis, OR to Palmdale, CA a few years back in my '62 DC
&gt; with a 1600SP and about 2600 lbs of my stuff.  Empty my truck is 2200lbs.  I
&gt; checked one of the scales before leaving Oregon and it settled on 4800lbs.
&gt; The Grapevine was all second gear, with redux boxes.

I don't find the grapevine to be all that bad, but since I go over it
several times per year I suppose familiarity breeds contempt.

Now, the old Ridge Route, that's a road!
