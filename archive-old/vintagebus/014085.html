All,

The '67 will go into heavy rotation soon. One issue that I need to tackle
first is pulling the motor to replace the fuel lines and engine room seal. I
would like to install a fuel shut-off valve of some sort at the tank to make
future engine pulls more enjoyable. I also will be removing that little
plastic fuel filter that is inline between the fuel pump and carb and
relocating it somewhere outside the engineroom. A fuel shut-off valve will
be helpful for those frequent filter changes (not to mention a handy theft
prevention device)

Any recomendtions as to where to buy one or a specific kind that has worked
for you?

Chris
