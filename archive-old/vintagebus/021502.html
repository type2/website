 What part number is on the back of the speedo?  If the first three numbers
are 111 or 113 then it is type1, if 211 then it is type 2.    Eric &amp; Barb &gt;&gt;
 

I was told if the connect is off to the side it is a bug.  I have been told 68
and later bugs have a fuel gauge in speedo.  Ithas a angled connect and the
date is may 68.  Looks like I have a part bug and part bus, bus.
