Hey All, If your name is in the TO: box you are a
Turtle Springs Virgin in need of directions for the
3rd Annual Bus Rendezvous this coming week-end, Oct
1-3 .  Some of you were here but forgot how you got
here  or got home, so you are revirginated.
  If your name is in the Cc: box, you are invited to
the party too, some of you have already been here,
some of you have already told  us you are coming, some
of you may as yet be undecided.  Do decide and let us
know if your decision is to join us so we can plan for
the Red Neck Country Champagne Breakfast at Molly's
Valley Inn in Batavia.
  The week end is shaping up to be a another great DBG
event.  Looks like about 40 of us will gather for good
times which will include, cooping, campfire, caravan
to October Fest in Elkhart Lake if interested - a fall
color tour of Wisconsin' Beautiful Kettle Moraine,
conversation, a VW rummage and open house at SRP, the
local VW garage and much more.  

Now for the directions:
    
FROM THE SOUTH
Getting here is best accomplished by coming North
from Milwaukee on I 43.  A bit North of Milwaukee
highway 57 FORKS off to the left.  Take it, 57 that
is, North to Adell, Wisconsin.  Turn left on Highway A
- travel West for 5 miles - look for sign on barn and
a VW by the road to signal your successful virgin
voyage.
  WARNING - Do Not Turn on Highway A at Fredonia.  You
will get hopelessly lost.  
  If problems call my pager 414 590-3457  and I'll get
back to you.  
FROM THE NORTH 
The approach is different depending on whether
you are coming down 41-45 or 57.  If down 57- turn
right at Adell (1st village south of Waldo) on to
County A, travel 5 miles to Turtle Springs Farm on
left side of road.  There is a lit sign on the barn
and there will be a VW of some sort sittin by the road
to signal successful navigation. If coming down 41-45
it is a bit less straight forward. Highway 67 off of
41 toward Plymouth to Sheboygan Co SS, turn right and
follow to Highway 28, turn right, travel south to
County A on north edge of Batavia, turn left toward
Adell and look for the 5th house on the right, the
barn sign &amp; VW and you are there.

FROM THE WEST 

Get yourself to Kewaskum, Wisconsin - it is on your
Wisonsin map north of West Bend on Highway 45.  In the
center of Kewaskum find Highway 28 and follow it to
the east and north east until you reach Batavia.  On
the north edge of Batavia (just past the Methodist
Churh 0n your right) turn right (Highway A) toward
Adell.  We are the 5th house on the right.  Look for
the sign on the barn and the VW by the road to signal
successful navigation.

All these directions assume that you remember to bring
a Wisconsin Map and these directions with you.  A good
navigator and a sense of humor make for an adventure
vs an ordeal getting here.  Most people, especially
those of you from urban area under estimate the
distance.  We are 43 miles from Milwaukee Center
coming up on 57 and 49 miles from the zoo interchange
on Milwaukees west side.  If problems call my pager
414 590-3457  and I'll get back to you - I may be on
the road or out in the woods, so give me a minute to
get to a phone.

See you all this week end.  Jim &amp; Patti
