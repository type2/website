Subject: Re: [VB] Mudflaps on Ebay

&gt;I just thought I would warn you about buying Mudflaps on ebay. There is a seller who is claiming to have NOS German Mudflaps for sale but they are Not German. I won one of his auctions but fortunately he never completed the transaction. I have been in contact with the other buyer and he told me they are brazillian and are complete garbage. The seller appears to be a &quot;major&quot; supplier of VW parts as well, though they had some setbacks within the last few years. Here is the link:

I'll 2nd that. A friend of mine called me when he saw &quot;they&quot; (RMMW) had 
NOS mud flaps listed in their catalog for $50 a set. Needless to say he 
was a bit miffed when they showed up and clearly said &quot;Hecho in Brazil&quot;, 
or something to that effect, definitely *not* German!
