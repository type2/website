Subject: 65 so 42 westy (new arrival)
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

another bus arrived today, just got a 65 westy
pearl white, all original from the second owner
this bus was listed on the type 2 classified
for a cheap price, thought it would be a pile
but lo and behold it was a absoulty rust free,original paint, lived
all it's life in nevada bus, even no surface rust underneath it, almost unheard of nowadays, the bonus was it came with the childs cot, churchkey
last but not least the original so42 handbook and
owners manual in there plastic pouch,, haven't finished searching through the rest of the bus 
yet to see what other goodies mite be there, o yes anyone ever seen a westy inside spare tire cover? but now the sad part towing it home from
LOST WAGES the transmission froze, nice skid marks down the vegas strip, got it towed to a friends house and will pic it up tomorrow 
this time on a trailer, hope to have tranny fixed in time for the VEGAS show and TUCSON.
yet another good find right at my backdoor
