Subject: Insane VW chicks

Okay I'm catching this on Sunday  (but it feels like Friday :)
This 'clinically insane' thing has me cracking up! I love and drive my
'67 Deluxe &amp; I think I qualify 'insane' because:

1- I went to go look at another bus to buy so I'd have 2 &amp; SERIOUSLY
considered
   selling my '90 Fox to buy the '65 Westy
2- It's been 2 weeks and I am *still* thinking about that damn bus
3- My girlfriends have written me off as *hopeless* (I can't even be
bothered to go shopping,
   -unless for parts- I'm either working on the bus or saving for said
parts)
4- My sister knows that whenever she visits from out-of-state that it
qualifies as
   a 'special ocassion' and she gets 'chauffered' in the bus (granted I
drive it almost 
   everyday anyway, but the Fox is left at home due to principle now)
5- My bedside table has 5 technical manuals for the splittie-year busses
and *1* school text book
6- Wait-time reading material when I absolutely *have* to take my
bus/car into VW is a shop manual
   (either for the Fox or the Bus)
7- A VW swap meet or show in town will dominate my weekend
8- I actively look for things to fix/repair/upgrade on my bus
9- the fact that I can list this many things and still feel confident
about listing more
   qualify me as 'insane' :)

Of course in contradiction to the requirement that Brian listed is that
the girl must be
single to be insane - I'm married (so *there*) to a non-VW guy (oops
back in 'insanity')

As far as I'm concerned, any/all other 'insane' VW chicks are perfectly
fine by me, in fact,
I'm more than happy to invite them all over for a BBQ. We can drink beer
and tear apart 
motors (but they'll go back in 'cause who wants a messy garage anyway?)
and laugh about 
why guys can't handle girls who know their VW's and try and figure out
what's up with the 
other girls who can't get a clue about being more than their boyfriend's
trophy-babe at shows.. 
.......ooohhh wait I see a connection.... ;)
