    I have a Transmission question? I recently replaced my engine (1600DP) and
 noticed that my trans boots were badly needing replacement. They were torn
 and had probably been that way for a long time I went down to the my local
 mechanic and bought some new ones. I didn't think at the time to check the
 transmission fluid to see if it was low but it was. I have driven the bus
 around for about 300 miles now most locally. But when I took it out of town
 about 20 miles or so when I got to a stop I couldn't get it into gear. When
 I went to a local shop today to have them check the trans fluid it was
 almost empty. I had him top it off but it probably didn't have any fluid
 left in there. 1) Has anyone had this problem not being able to shift with
 low transmission fluid and 2 do you think that the transmission has been
 damaged because of  a low fluid level.

yes, if your boots are torn, the thing to do is drain the remants of the oil 
out, replace the boots, and fill the RGBoxes, then fill the center section.

since you drove around on low oil, and something is funky, yes you may well 
have damaged your tranny.

I had this happen with the first splitty I bought, didn't know to check axle 
boots/oil, drove for a while, it started making noise (didn't yours?) friends 
said check the oil, there wasn't any and the boots were torn, so I replace 
boots, filled it and got 10K more miles out of it before total destruction as 
the damage had already begun,

Oops.

If it will shift now that it has oil, you will probably get some more miles 
out of it, but its useful life has been shortened.
