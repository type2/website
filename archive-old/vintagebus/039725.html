&gt;Response to Claralw_at_aol_dot_com &amp; microbusman_at_hotmail_dot_com

There was a post awhile back that talked about their rebuilds and after 
looking at the site saved the URL because I thought it was a good reference 
and I knew I would be there at some point in the near future.  The URL is 
&quot;http://www.nateswaterart_dot_com/engine_build.htm&quot;.  I tried to hit it 
unsuccessfully a few moments ago but we are having funny problems with the 
firewall (power related?  Good 'ol California) so you might have a go 
yourself.  I hope its still good!
