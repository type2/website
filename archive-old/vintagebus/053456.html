Subject: saw a 1960 single cab for sale today

Hello everyone,
I looked at a pretty nice fairly original 1960 single cab today.
Original Dove Blue interior. Paint on outside it faded but mostly all there. 
Some surface rust in spots. Fairly straight and solid. Didn't see any rust 
underneath. Driver's floor was wasted but the owner had the replacement panel 
that goes with the truck. Busted treasure chest door but owner says he has an 
NOS one that goes with it. I saw it laying inside the compartment but didn't 
pull it out. Has had rear brakes replaced and need the front gone through. 
Comes with all parts to replace front brakes. Needs tires as it's got mud 
tires on rear. Fenderwells are nice and clean. 
Comes with both bumpers, taillights are clean. Nose is dented in near the 
bottom and could be an easy fix.
Supposedly has a rebuilt motor with only a few thousand miles on it. Ran 
really nice when fired up but didn't idle very well. Could be an intake leak 
or carb problem. Stock exhaust. 
Has a weird metal welded rack in the bed, but that's an easy fix. Dumpster 
nearby.
Gates are pretty nice and straight. Back one is a little warped, but they 
open and close nice.
Tranny and RGB's are supposedly in good shape ad don't make and noise.
Owner wants $2500 for the truck. To me it's worth every penny for a driver or 
a base restoration. Would look sweet restored as it's an original dove blue 
truck.
I'd like it for myself, but too many cars already. Unless I could sell 
someone on the list my 74 chevy truck and 60 hardtop bug which are for sale.

P-mail me if anyone wants some more info or the sellers number. Truck is 
located in Benicia in the SF Bay Area.
