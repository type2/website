Subject: Re: [VB] help on engine black paint

He's looking into it but I also thought I would post up to the list for

Automotive paint companies have a glaze reducer that you add to paint.
You just get the color you want and mix the glaze reducer.
It just takes a little experimenting to get the semi flat finish you
want.
