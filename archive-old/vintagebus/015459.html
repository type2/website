Ellis cant imagine having a radio in a VW that works
or could be heard over the absence of interior. I wear
pistol shooter's -27db earplugs while I drive the
shell of a '63 EZcamper and hum &quot;CampTown Ladies&quot; over
and over. Sounds like a PiperCub inside and makes me
feel like Chas. Lindberg everytime I make it across
town and back on the daily commute. I also find myself
making up words to creative foul mouthed tunes
commenting on why the illegal alien landscaping trucks
with all of the shivering Julios in the backend insist
on driving in the freekin fast lane and Yuppschmucks
want to go a million MPH in the other lanes... I just
merrily chew my Swisher Sweets/Sweet Coronellas in the
middle lane and mess em all up at 60.
Doo dah, Doo dah~ All the m_at_^&amp;%!!* live-long day...

(cant hear ya, I gots my earplugs in!-wait a minute, I
gots ta spit)
