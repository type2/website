Ahhhh.  Interesting night.

Readjusted the clutch from scratch this afternoon, since I thought I may
have overtightened the adjustment when I set it after puting the engine
in...(slipping, but not leaking enough oil to normally justify it..)

The pedal just feels different from Ichigo's, so I overdid it...doh.:/

Took it out tonight to the hardware store (and to a friends, to drop off a
phone..)..

On the way back, just as I turned onto the main road that is a 12 mile
shot to my house, I shifted to 4th.

And &quot;hmm!&quot; thinks I.  That sure shifted smooooooth.  Wierd even.  Let out
the clutch..Wheee!  Still in third.  Declutch, and wiggle the shifter.
Damn.

Something in the linkage seperated.  At least it was third gear...If it
has of been anything else, I'd have pulled over and put it IN third...

I'm guessing it to be the 33 year old shift coupling...Raining, not going
to look yet.:)

More parts to order...

later...david
