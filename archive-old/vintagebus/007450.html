Thanks for all the replies.

Update: The engine is out of the 71 and I saw that the front seal was
leaking. Off with the flywheel to replace but could not see any evidence of
an &quot;o&quot; ring, or the gasket between the crank and flywheel. I put it back
together with a new front seal and no gasket the same way it came apart. Did
I mess up?

The end play the way I did it was .005&quot;. This is without the gasket and only
the two shims that were there.

Also, I torqued to 240 per Muir, but read 253 in Bentley tonight. Is that a
big deal?

I hate VWs. :-)

&gt; &gt; Actual 71's had a different bolt arrangement for the engine/trans bolt
on the
&gt; &gt; top left.
&gt;
&gt; I had this problem with my '69, and solved it by
&gt; using an allen head bolt for the upper driver's
&gt; mounting bolt.  It was pretty hard to find the
&gt; bolt, but I believe I ended up finding them at
&gt; NAPA.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; just change the bellhousings along with the engine.
&gt;
&gt; &quot;just change the bellhousing?&quot;
&gt; You do realize how much grimy, greasy,
&gt; smelly, sweaty, cussing work you're
&gt; laying on Doc in a sentence beginning
&gt; with &quot;just&quot;, don't you?  You are sadistic
&gt; and twisted :-)
