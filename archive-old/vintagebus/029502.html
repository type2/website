Having had a couple of vehicles painted by Maaco and a few painted by Earl
Scheib, I'll offer the following comments...

Both are capable of doing a decent paint job, but one ALWAYS gets what one
pays for.  If you pay for the $199 special, do not expect a factory new
result.  I've also noted that with either different shops yeild different
results.  Living in the San Diego area (at the time), I had a choice of four
Earl Scheibs and at least three Maacos.  Each produced differing results. 
Your best option is to 1.) shop around.  Go look at each shop's finished
product.  Look for a couple of weeks at different times of the week.  Many of
these shops use 'part-time' workers and the paint job done on say Tuesday
might be substantually better than the Thursday job.  2.)  Ask locally.  Ask
the shop to provide previous customer's names and look them up.  See how the
result is holding up.  Finally, 3.) DO NOT go for the bargain basement
special.  Instead, go for the middle quality price.  The results will be MUCH better.

As always, YMMV.

An afterthought...  If you are planning to let them do any bodywork, ask if
you can supply the filler.  If so, pick up a gallon of 'All-Metal' filler at
the local body shop supply house and ask them to use it.  Much better than the
usual plastic filler.
