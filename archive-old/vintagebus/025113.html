Hi, 
This is the way to go.  Except if this bus is to be a safe daily driver you
would be better off installing the tranny with later reduction boxes and the
later front beam.  This will result in 2 MPH increase in speed due to higer
gearing in the reductions.  Plus with both the rear and front brakes increased
20% in size it will feel like it has 50% better brakes than what was standard
used between 1955-63.
