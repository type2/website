Subject: [VB] Re: front shift coupler &amp; screw?

Billy -

	Since you have a 65 you will have the late coupler. I just went through this on my bus.  I ended up getting a coupler and screw from wolfsburg west a bit expensive $20 for coupler $2.50 for screw.  Their website shows none in stock but when I called they had one.  I cut mine off with a dremel tool, it was a pain but I didn't damage my shift rod. 
	I assume you will change the plastic bushing at the front of the rod?
 	
	good luck

	rob
