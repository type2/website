&gt;This rear apron/ (sorry don't know the correct term) was inside of my 
&gt;66 camper when I bought it.  It definietly does not fit this bus (latch
&gt;is different) Just wondering, is this apron from a barndoor bus, and if
&gt;so, does anyone want to trade me the correct 66 apron for this one?

That looks like the one on my '64.  I think the latch on the apron
changed when they changed from the church-key socket to the push button
at the very beginning of the '66 model year.

The '67 parts manual online at http://home.cwru_dot_edu/~agw4/docs.htm
has these three entries for &quot;End cross member - Rear panel&quot; on page 407:

211 813 175 B  up to 20-117 901
211 813 175 B  from 20-117 902 to 215 190 000
211 813 175 C  from 216 000 001 

I'm pretty sure the above numbers break down as &quot;Barndoor&quot; (Wolfsburg?),
&quot;post-Barndoor to '65&quot; (Hannover?), and &quot;'66 and up&quot;.  I think the
original Barndoor apron would have had the starting crank hole; looks
like they had superseded it to the version without the hole by the
time this '67 manual was printed.

Anyway, what you have is probably a 211 813 175 B and what you need
is a 211 813 175 C.
