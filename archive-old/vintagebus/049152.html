Historical day yesterday that I was lucky enough to be a part of.

7:30 am departure time with my good friend Joe Crockett.  Mission:  to pick up Jerry Jess' NEW 1951 Microbus at Port Hueneme, California.  We roll into the U.S. Customs office at 8:50 am for the 9:00 am appointment.  Into Chief Inspector King's office I go (those federal buildings sure make me nervous).  25 minutes later I've paid the duty on the bus and all of the paperwork has been signed off.  Next stop is the shipping line office.  Pay the duty there and we're off to go pick up the bus.  After winding through several parking lots of new BMW's that had been offloaded the day before we see her, in all of her glory.  A 1951 Volkswagen Microbus standing tall amognst the other pewny automobiles.  

Let me say this bus is nice.  Maybe not perfect, but very nice.  Since Joe is a veteran at Volkswagens, and has owned several Barndoors, he was in charge.  Before I knew it Joe had the decklid open and was doing a first blush inspection.  After several attempts to start it Joe checked the gas tank.  Low, if not empty.  After a little more snooping we discovered that the reserve tap was reversed.  Flip it around and it started right up.  Off to the gas station.

Pump in 6 gallons and we hit US 101 to Santa Barbara.  The bus ran great.  Semaphores even worked!  55 minutes later and it's comfortably and safely parked in the driveway.  Sorry for such a boring report, but everything went so smoothly.  We were prepared for the worst, with gas, tool bag, cables, parts.  I suppose it's when you don't go prepared that Murphy's Law strikes.

Anyway, Uncle Jerry got himself a good one.  This is a bus to be proud of.  All the best UJ!

Robert
