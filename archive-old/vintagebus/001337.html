Well, only if I can add to this a little from my own experience. I towed two
busses so far, both behind my Ford Explorer on a dolly rented from U-Haul.
As long as you have two good tires, load it up on a dolly and viola!! ready
to go. At least with a dolly you don't have to worry much about play in your
front end. Make sure you stop and check things every now and then. On my
last trip which lasted 500 miles I did not notice anything wrong until I got
home. The ball got loose somehow so safety chains are a must!! make sure the
lights are in good order and never go faster then necessary. If the speed
limit is 75 it doesn't mean you have to go 75. Bus behind you might not like
it. I never really toyed with the idea of buying a tow bar. Last rental cost
me a total of $74.00. I think it was worth it.
Just my opinion.

&gt; someone mentioned safety chains- yes definitely.    An unchained towed
&gt; vehicle (boat trailer?  jumped the tow ball went across the center line of
&gt; the road and ran up a certain individuals bug hood and hit him physically.
&gt; That isn't good.  be safe, drive slower than usual, leave lots of braking
&gt; space, try to aim for time when the roads are emptier.
