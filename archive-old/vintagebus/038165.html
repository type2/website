Subject: 30K mile field bus questions
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com


Friend of mine found a '66 bus with about 30K original miles.  Been sitting 
outside for several years.  Pretty rusty but has a lot of good parts.  I'm 
mainly interested in the mechanical parts.  Anyone have any insight as to how 
the trans, reduction gears, steering box, etc, might be after sitting outside 
for a couple decades?
