Back to the ol' JB Weld fix. Find a 10mm bolt long enough to fit through the
tranny and case. Vaseline the threads and temp mount your case on a tranny.
push the bolt through from the tranny side and then wrap electrical tape
around threads until it fits enlarged nut insert hole and push the tape back
down your Vaseline threads into the hole. This centers the bolt for the next
step. Take a sharp chisel and tap a few burs into the metal around hole on
engine side. Mix up your JB Weld and generously apply around hole. Run a
clean 17mm nut down on your bolt and firmly tighten it. Scrape extra JB Weld
up around nut and let set overnight. Next day take your bolt out and
whahlah, you have a poor mans nut insert.

&gt; Hey y'all
&gt; I'm getting ready to convert the Tinkertoy (67 d-luxx) to a doghouse
cooler.
&gt; I remember there's an issue with left top engine mount.  Those of you who
&gt; have done this - what's the solution?

Easy:  Dont use the third bolt. :)

Or...

find the right-length bolt to come in from the transaxle side.  Find a
case with the pressed in nut.  Press the nut into your case.  Fight your
way around the clutch lever and install the bolt. :)

If you cant find a pressed in nut....good luck fitting a nut and wrench
between the cooler and the case....it can probably be done....
