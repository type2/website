also what is the list concensus on using the 3:88 ring and pinion in a bus
trans to get better speed, any major problems after many miles? any after only
a few? and is the trans in a 58 different from later splits in case the case
with the truck is cracked or unrebuildable? i know i said i want to keep it
stock, but hey im also putting in lap belts and a fuel gague :) ok im done

Think you should get the truck and see what all is wrong with it before you 
plan on swapping out the trans.     Especially as this is your first ACVW, 
dont tear it all apart at once or you will  probably lose interest .
Odds are it does not have the split case tranny.   they had a trans ith a 
case in two halves like the engine, with a seam down the middle through May 
59.   from 53through 59 they were synchros fror 2nd 3rd and 4th, but for 1st 
and reverse yu have to come to a full and complete stop to change into those 
gears.  They also had the low RGs, as they had a 36hp motor which gets a low 
geared trans.  As NQ said, VW would change the gearing and the engine size to 
match. tranny cases don't tend to crack.  
If you want to have a 1600, seems best to stay away from the 3.88, or you 
will lose power up hills.  If you want to have the 3.88, best to have a 
bigger motor.  There is loads in the archives.

dont hack a guage into your dash.

Is this truck running and drivable?
