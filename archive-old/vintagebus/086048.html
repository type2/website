Subject: Re: [VB] Oil leaks

The new pump slipped right in. I did use a pump puller, it didnt' work too well because of the old style pump that was on there, not Schadeck or Melling. Case nuts were torqued to 26 lbft. I did at one point use a screwdriver between the case and pump but NO gauge marks were left. Seals were installed properly.No sealant was used on the nuts for oil pump and oil pump was not torqued. I am going to pull the pump againg to install one that has 6mm mounting studs, like my case has, soon. As far as the trueness of the pump cover, well, I don't know. Looked pretty flat to me.
