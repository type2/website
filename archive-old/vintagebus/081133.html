&gt;&gt;  Is it bad synchros or problem in the slider assemblies? &lt;&lt;

Hi Cal,
If it was either of those items were causing problems you would have gear 
grinding only when shifting into gear.
  Again, did you check the clutch boden tube for correct bend in it?  This 
bend acts as a shock absorber so the clutch does not grab quite as hard and also 
to prevent clutch bouncing when released to quickly.
  Also would be interesting to know if this problem happened to start when/if 
you had changed any clutch with new parts or differant type of clutch 
components.  
  Plus are you running a sprung or solid clutch disc?  The sprung type is 
better for the daily driver because the springs in the disc help absorb clutch 
grab and reduce this shock to the engine which in turn increases engine main 
bearing longevity.  For the drag racer these are not good because the springs get 
smashed down causing the clutch disc to have a slop to it.
  This main bearing affect we have seen with manual vs. autostick 1968-70s 
bugs/KGs.  With proper maintenance and not driven to extreme limits.  A manual 
trannied bug would get at most about 100,000 miles between rebuilds.  While the 
autostick with its hydralic torque converter which takes out almost all 
shifting shock between the engine and tranny, more often than not got 150,000 
between rebuilds.
