So the engine that was in my bus when I dragged it out of the trees has =
finally developed a fatal flaw. The main bearing is bad and has ruined =
the case. I have a good builder ready to go on what he says will be a =
78.4 x 88 (1907). He says it will be a good, strong, not hot rod bus =
engine, but alas! My case is shot.I thought I had an AJ (fuel injected) =
case lined up but it turned out to be bad also. I have been told that =
the AJ is the strongest and best case available for building.

I can't find one. I have found somebody in Sacramento, of whom I know =
nothing, who says he can &quot;scare one up&quot;. Maybe he can. If I don't come =
up with anything, he's the front runner.

So, I call on the knowledge and experience of this great collective to =
tell me who to call and what is right and wrong. Help me please.

I don't have any reduction boxes and I am using a '68 specially built =
transmission. I have no interest in doing over 70 miles an hour, but I =
do want to run an AC. I'm in Dallas, Texas. It's way way hot alot.
