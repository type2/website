&lt;&lt; My 67 Bus wanders on the road, I know it is in need of a front end
 alignment, but wherever I go they tell me that they can't do cars this
 old. I went to a VW dealer and they said that no adjustments could be
 made, but the Bently manual says otherwise. What should I do? &gt;&gt;

Chris,
A few years ago, I needed my 67 aligned.  The Big O by my house said they 
couldn't do it, but the one by my work said they could.  (The bus met an 
untimely death and never was aligned.)
It may take a while, and a lot of foot work, but you'll be able to find a 
shop with a &quot;old timer&quot; or maybe someone who has a bug or bus and knows how 
to do it.
