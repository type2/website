 I think this was the best VW show that I have ever been to. Hope with the
problems that the GGC can work it for next year, hate to have my 1st Kelly
Park be my last.
 Met alot of listies and got to see Thoms &quot;pale yellow&quot; van, great job Thom.
The 55 Westy is great also.
 Never did get to see everything. The show was so huge and spread out it
would be like trying to see Disneyland in one afternoon. I loved it, will be
1st or 2nd in line next year.
 Thanks to Jethro and Sandy and all the Split Bus Club members for taking
care of all us out of town visitors, you guys were great, thanks a bunch.
 The Red Barn was fun, but real small. It was a buyers market as I think
there were more campers and sellers than buyers. Hopefully this event will
grow each year. The Red Barn owners loved us wand want the VW's back next
year.
 The London Bridge Bullis served our famous tacos Fri. night for the early
campers, beer, tacos, and good friends, it was great.

 Thats it short and sweet.
