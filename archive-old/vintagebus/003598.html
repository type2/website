I figure I would chime in on my recent encounter,
    Well, the other day I picked up my two front door handles from getting
re-keyed at
the dealership. I got them done to match the ignition key. In order to do
so, he had to make new keys to remove the lock mechanism from the handle.
When I was getting ready to leave I told him I would be bringing my rear
hatch and cargo door handles in sometime too. So I was getting ready to pay
and asked him how much? &quot;Don't worry about it, and bring in your other locks
whenever you want to.&quot;  I was ready for a hefty fee for the amount of time
it took to make them work properly because the were frozen due to years of
non-use. But no charge!!! I have been very impressed with my experiences
with them in the past, but this one takes the cake!
