If you already have rust there taring is not gonna stop it ,,cut it out weld 
in patch sections and do it rite you'll be better off in the long run 
,,Ronnie at old volks home can get the windshield repair section from england 
,,you don't have to replace the whole section unless you just wanna have a 
lot of fun ,,The 60 Westy of Rob Braden ,,the whole bottom sectionfrom 
3inches up the post to  the area below the wipers was fabbed and installed by 
me and it looked great ,,but thats my .02cents worth ,, 
 &quot;Hope you are joking!  Best to figure that you would be lucky to get two 
windows done in a weekend.  If you are not then at least just tar the heck 
out of it and hopefully that will stop the rust.
