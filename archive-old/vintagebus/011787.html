&quot;Kyle&quot; &lt;cal4570_at_concentric_dot_net&gt; and Joe the lurker were frothing at the
mouth to &quot;out&quot; me regarding my arrival to the event on the end of a tow rope.

Well, OK be that way! ;-) VanBondo and his lady had a relative noneventful
trip to the Jerome meet until we got up and over the bigassed mountain pass
that leads into Jerome. We crawled to the downhill side and were enjoying
the tailgater on my butt with the Halogen highbeams when the shifter coupler
set screw decided to &quot;go missing&quot; as our UK friends say. We were free
wheeling in neutral for miles until I decided to pull it over. Move up, step
aside, let the man go through...
A thorough search for the spare coupler that I *always* carry and the extra
set screw that I always include in the toolbox revealed that they were
safely stowed in the RFH. No bolt could be found. Flashlight batteries
failed, not enough brains to manipulate the nose cone into any gear and
creep into the event.
Broken and busted two miles from Jerome...
 
Repeated requests for a simple set screw went unanswered after flagging down
several passer-by vehicles. Good ole Everett Barnes finally gave me a ride
into camp only to find that two rednecked FORD and CHEVY fans were already
in the process of towing the rat '63 of mine into camp. I suspect just to
spite me. I mean, REALLY! A two second set screw replacement woulda done the
trick. I *allow* these guys to give me a rough time once in awhile seeing as
they are ballsy enough to drive American technology to the baddest VW event
of the year. Nice choice. ;-) Seriously, thanks for the help.

Many folks wondered why we drove &quot;THAT thing&quot; (the rat '63) instead of the
RFH trophy whore. Hey, its my thing. Besides, it Jerome. The nice one is
hers and the headlights on the barn were DOA. This Jerome was weird in my
book but fun. The ropehead bongo crowd danced and attempted to dance and
keep a 4/4 beat. Trying over and over and over... I don't get it. No
piercings this year that I was privy to. The &quot;Pierced Man&quot; was burned in
effigy. =) 
The positive side was that many new attendees came from out of State. I was
disappointed that several of the California contengent decided to stay home.
We missed the Box on Wheels and some of the gurus. Big Thank you to the
*VINTAGE TRANSPORTERS ONLY*, RT66 Splits and Sacto NEATO chapters for making
it. Sorry if I missed any other NEATO chapters. The &quot;Super Lurker&quot; will just
have to forgive me. Thanks to all who made the effort. Paula and I camped
near Katie and Matt/Keith and Cindy, VWFOOL_at_AOL_dot_com and made fun of the
young &quot;Hey Dudes&quot; who invaded our space. Every other word was &quot;Dude&quot; The
other alternating word can not be &lt;F'ing&gt; mentioned here. Those DOODs were
worse than a MAD TV skit! People were amazed at the many tank bikes/trikes
in our camp.

Lots of fun over all! =)
