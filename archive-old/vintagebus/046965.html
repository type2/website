 Now the question, I believe I remember someone (Clara?) saying to grease the
 bolts when I put them in.  I was wondering what the preferred grease is.  I
 am planning on using the silver anti-sieze stuff unless someone recommends
 otherwise. &gt;&gt;
Hi Terry &amp; Sunshine,
Use grease, if your bus has pre-1964 reduction gear boxes you will want to
also fill the pocket in the back of each to keep water from sitting there.  If
you have 1964-67 reduction gear boxes grease lightly the swing plate where the
box sits and then apply a layer of silicon sealant to the back of the
reduction gear box plug.  Then bolt the pregreased bolts quickly before the
silicon dries and the sandwiching of the sealant will seal the back of the
redution gear boxes.  Did you make sure that the bolts you are using are grade
8 or a metric equivalent hardness?  The silver anti-sieze is great stuff, but
we prefer using it only in high temp areas (Heads, exaust systems.) and we are
not sure of the chemical make up of the anti-sieze (Does it have lead of some
other heavy metal in it?) and the grease in low temp areas works just as well
and costs much less per amount.    Eric &amp; Barb
