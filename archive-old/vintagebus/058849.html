Subject: RE: [VB] Re: Valve Gap!

It all depends if you want to go by European spec or U S. VWoA superceded
the original .004 gap to .006 for the U S market in the late 60's or early
70's. The reason was the lazy Americans would not adjust there valves on a
regular basis causing them to tighten up and burn valves (while under
warranty). Somewhere in one of my books there is the supplement stating
this.

Ronnie   so to be on the safe side I would recommend .006

ps. I use a 4/6 no go gauge, loose at .004 and tight at .006 seems happy at
.005

	Can someone tell me what the valve gap should be on a 1600dp
engine?  I want to run down and get a feeler gauge I have seemed to have
lost mine.

 

 

Thanks,
