If you broke down
&gt; on the road and have no signal on your cell, you could at least ask truck
&gt; drivers over CB to contact the State Trooper or Highway Patrol for a wellbeing
&gt; check. If you can, I'd suggest carrying both cellphone and CB.

Hey,

Does &quot;REACT&quot; still exist??  When I was a kid, I remember my dad calling
them.  To the best of my knowledge, they were much like a volunteer CB
&quot;AIRS&quot;.  People would listen in shifts and send help for people.  I
think they monitored ch 3.  Not sure.
