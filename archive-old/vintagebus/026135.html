I agree with Douglas when he says that the stock split window bus
achieves a balance of speed, power and efficiency at full throttle
(WOT!) going 60mph.  36 HP here sounds about right too for this
scenario.  The issue that many out there may have with this is that
their bus will go a lot faster than 60 mph at WOT and exceed whatever
the redline may be on their no longer stock engine.  How many&quot;stock&quot;
engines out there today are running 6.6-1 CRs?  How many are balanced to
at least factory standards?  How many are still 1200-1500cc in
displacement?  The reality is that most Vintage Bus folks cannot safely
run their bus WOT.  You guys are really missing out on a big part of the
fun.  WOT at cruising speed is the fundamental harmony and balance of
the splitty!  Gary Gibson  Tucson
