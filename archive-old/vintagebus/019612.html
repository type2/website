Someone wrote, regarding SUVs:
4.) A 4-wheel drive!!!  I'm invulnerable!!!
++++++++++++

This is something I've really noticed this winter here
in western Wisconsin.  I've had occassion to drive to
Minneapolis-St. Paul a couple of times when the roads
were snow covered and slippery, and I noticed that at
least 80% of the vehicles in the ditches were SUVs,
and most of the roll-overs were SUVs.  People drive
them like they are invulnerable, with no regard for
other drivers, blabbing on their cell phones and
drinking their coffee, creating a hazard for those of
us in &quot;sensible&quot; vehicles. (My buses are home in the
garage when the weather is like this.  The rabbits or
the toyota can take their chances against the snow,
ice, salt and crazy SUV drivers.)

The first time that I noticed so many SUVs in the
ditches, I didn't do an actual count, but after that I
paid more attention to the actual numbers and types of
vehicles off the road and in the ditches.  The St.
Paul paper even acknowledged the exceptional number of
SUVs in the ditches due to ice and snow.
