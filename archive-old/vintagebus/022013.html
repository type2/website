 I hear tell that it's not a good idea to reset endplay without rebuilding
 the lower end.  I've always wondered if that is really true, so what's
 your insight on that?  I think it had to do with inevitable tightening up
 of the #1 bearing, which might explain your engines sluggishness if true.
   Any insight would be appreciated.

nope- that's not it.   AAMOF, it is a good thing to adjust the endplay-
reduces wear on things by eliminating the excess slop.   Mine wasn't out all
that much- but as it was out I felt it would be good to reset it.   If an
engine has a LOT of end play there is probably already some damage in there,
which adjusting will not repair.
