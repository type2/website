Hi.

Has anyone had experience wtih a tranny from the So.
Cal. company &quot;TRANSFORM&quot;?

I have one PO installed in my 67 deluxe. Installed in
1994, but only has about 1500 miles on it.

I got underneath the bus to top off the gear oil,
(since it has been leaking about a teaspoon a day from
the sideplate) and I noticed it looks like there is
leak evidence (dark oil areas coated with dirt) at
more than one point in the seams of the case. Not even
as bad as the sideplate leak, but should I get this
this pulled, broken down and resealed? Or would it be
worth it to start somewhere else?

Are these guys the GEX of trannies? I have no idea.

Any experience would be helpful
