&lt;&lt; I searched all the code sections and could not find a single section that
 said anything about the windshield being in place.  I think that one could
 make a very good argument in court if you were driving with safari's open or
 a Thing's windshield down, that both vehicles are &quot;equipped with adequate
 windshields&quot; and that the law does not mention anything about the required
 position of those windshields. &gt;&gt;

I've asked my brother, a San Jose, CA cop, what his interpretation would be. 
Actually his personal opinion would probably be &quot;Cool, dude! I used to have a 
67 Deluxe&quot; but hopefully he will reply soon with his professional opinion
