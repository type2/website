&lt;&lt; OK - quick question - how dificult is it to pull the alternator pulley
 without pulling the alternator out.? looked for info in Bently and it
 only showed it out.  Yes we have impacts.
 
 TIA &gt;&gt;

There is no need to pull the alternator or generator out to remove that oh so 
accessable pulley.

sometimes the inner half/hub will slide right off and the little half moon 
key will jump and hide, sometimes you need to get a coupler screwsdrivers and 
wiggle it off.

use grease or antiseize when installing a hub on the alt/gen shaft.
