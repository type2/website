Subject: Re: [VB] front wheel bearing questions

I did my front bearings last year, and it sounds like you got it right. 
The notched washer is called the 'thrust washer' and must be present to
seat and adjust the bearings properly.  The bendable lock washer ('lock
plate') goes between the two hex nuts.  I wasn't sure about those new
plastic grease seals either, so I ended up reusing my old-style ones
'cuz they were still good.

&gt; little grinding on the front passenger wheel whenever i braked in my bus. I
&gt; took the wheel off, and the hub and found some metal shavings around the
&gt; bearings-so i replaced both of them and the seal. The new seal I got is very
&gt; different from the one that was in there. The old one was basically square in
&gt; cross section, and the new one is U-shaped and has what looks like a spring on
&gt; it. it is also some type of plastic. It looks a lot like the front engine
&gt; seal. I installed it with the bottom of the U shape out-is that correct. Also
&gt; the nuts did not have a lock washer on them, nor did they appear to have the
&gt; correct washer that goes against the bearings(the one with a notch sticking
&gt; out to prevent it from rotating. so i replaced these as well. just checking to
&gt; see if i did this correct-anyone else run into this?
