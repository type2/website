Subject: Re: [VB] tight shoes

I'll bet a dollar you don't have the tab on the shoe properly in the
slot in the wheel cylinder.  Also, once long ago, I actually had
to shave material off said tab, as it was a bit too long.

&gt; pulled the drum off and re-oriented the shoes, adjusters backed off as far
&gt; as they'll go, tabs seem firmly seated in the wheel cylinder and adjusters
&gt; but still the drum is super tight against the shoes. I used more force than
&gt; I would have liked and got it on but it's so tight the bus is hard to push
&gt; in and out of the garage(no room to work inside). What am I'm missing?
