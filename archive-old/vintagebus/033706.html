    The whole Havasu tour has changed it's route. We will be heading to
Yucca, Cal first to deliver a bus then going over to the summit via Joshua
Tree, we are turning the normally boring drive into a TOUR. We still should
be at Chirico Summit as planned (around 9am). If anybody is meeting us there
please p-mail me and I will send you my cell number and you can send yours
so we can keep updated on the tour. Also if you have a  CB, we will be on
channel 2. Watch and listen for us. Vw Howard, Ronnie (2 buses), JP, Berry,
Kerry and maybe Lou,
Tommy (63 DD micro) and Jim Bell. Who else I don't know, but there will be a
bunch of us.
