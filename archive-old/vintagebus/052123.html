Oh yeh, reminds me of last time I pulled the engine too. One of my 
co-workers wanted to go for a ride in it. So on the way to lunch I told 
him, &quot;yeh, I pulled the engine yesterday to fix....&quot; . He looked at me kind 
of scared..&quot;In THIS&quot;. I said, &quot;yeh&quot;. He kind of stiffened up and held on a 
little tighter to the side of the seat. I just had to laugh.
