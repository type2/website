Has to be 1300-1500 SP, otherwise the dog house fanshroud wouldn't fit width
wise. I have converted a number of SP SR engines over to dog house in the
past. Generally I would recommend getting a DR block with the bigger oil pump,
but the SR can be converted easily by dropping the parts right on.

Hello Guys and Dolls    First which single port? not 25hp,or 36hp. 40hp
easier, 50hp yes , any 1600 sure  the differences is that the old heads had a
plate in them for the rod to  go thur. New heads don't have this plate that I
have seen. You would have trouble with the 40( 1200cc) cause of the width. I
just measured a old stlye housing verus the later dog house style and theres
no difference where the rod hooks or comes out of the housing. I don't think
someone is holding their mouth just right!  Later and have fun  Mark Dearing
