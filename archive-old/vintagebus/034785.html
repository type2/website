Hi Steve,
You need to use your original stift linkage from your 1961.
 
&lt;&lt;are parking brake cables the same, or do i need some of the 67 parts to get 
it all to work?&gt;&gt;
These are the only parts you may have to adapt.  If the 1964-67 cables are 
too long you will have to measure the length needed to reduce them and have 
them swedged at a shop.  Probably a sail boat shop can do the work needed.
 
&lt;&lt;since i am going to 12v, i planned on getting the 67 wiper assembly will it 
bolt right in?  &gt;&gt;
Wrong.  You will have to bash your defroster tubes to get it to fit.  Plus 
the 1967 wiper motor is rather hard to find and thusly expen$ive.  You would 
be better off using a resistor system and your original wiper motor setup.  
These were made from 1955 to about 1965 so lots were made compared to 1966 
and 1967 only years.
