I just took off my incorrect (barndoor) pop-out latch from my '61 Double 
door, and pictures of both latches are here:

onearth_dot_com/images/latches.jpg
onearth_dot_com/images/ends.jpg

The barndoor latch is the one with the holes, the DD latch has slots, and yes 
I was only able to get two screws in the bd latch because of the different 
shape of the triangular section.

Hope this is of help to somebody.
