The piece I'm talking about is mounted on the bottom of the removable seat
cushion, right in the middle. There are two rubber stoppers on each side so
the seat won't slide out towards the rear, then this thing. It's metal, 2
1/2&quot; long, stands 1 1/2&quot; high. Looking at it from the side it is 'L' shaped
with a rod coming off the vertical part parallel to the bottom.
Almost impossible to describe.

Unless you've seen one, you probably think I'm crazy...

&gt; I think that Jim is referring to the brass bracket that can be seen in the
pic you referenced as items &quot;A&quot;. Mine was gone when i got my bus nad I found
a very similar brass facsimilie at a local hardware store.

&gt; As Scott said there should be a brass sliding latch at the base of the
drivers side of the seat(near the plug outlet).  Additionally, there is the
piece you are referring to.  It keeps the seat attached to the drivers side
bulkhead.  The rod/clip you speak of should be threaded on one end and have
a black Bakelite knob threaded on to it.  There will be a hole in the
bulkhead that the rod goes through.  Attach the clip to the seat
bracket(screwed to the inside of the seat upright I think) and snug down the
knob from the drivers side of the bulkhead.  This secures the seat from
moving backwards.

&gt; I don't know why yours is &quot;L&quot; shaped.  Possibly bent?

&gt;
&gt; On the bottom of the seat there is some kind of weird mount type
&gt; thingy. It's sort of  'L' shaped that's round on one end with notches in
it
