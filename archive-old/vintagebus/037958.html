&lt;&lt; My understanding is that 1540 pounds per tire is the magic number, so do
 I get the C load range and have a better ride than with the D? &gt;&gt;
Hi Chad,
Load range C at 1540 Lbs. wieght load per tire is about as low as one would 
want to go for a wieght limit for bus.  The higher the wieght limit the 
better for the bus, especially one that may carry a load at one time or 
another.  Which is likely going to happen unless you have a super short wheel 
base bus!  Also the higher the wieght limit for the tires the less side wind 
and/or bow wave from semi truckers passing  problems you will have!  Eric&amp;Barb
