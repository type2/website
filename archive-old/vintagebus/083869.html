Subject: stroker motor?

Hi folks,

What do folks think of a 87mm X 74mm Stroker Crank motor in splitty with a 3.88 freeway flyer? Would this give me the torque I am looking for? It will be dual port with either dual Weber 34 ict's or dual Kadrons 40/44s...

Does anyone have thoughts or experience with these less common combinations?


Thanks
Eric
