Howdy Split Nosers;

  In the homebrew business, the recession (downturn in the economy), is
here.  In the New Jersey area more than 25 homebrew stores have closed for
one reason or another...most likely revenue had something to do with most
of the closings.  There are only 3 &quot;real&quot; homebrew stores left in NJ!

  On National Homebrew Day, Cinco de Mayo, Kentucky Derby and other
imbibing events our homebrew club brewed outside my store in the 61
Side-Loader.  The drop-plank area was excellent for a king kooker and 45
gal. SS pot and gave the extra 2 feet of gravity for the wort chiller to
the fermentors.  Since my store is next to a Mexican Grocery store we
called our sight Little Mexico, Mint Juleps were served around 5PM in
honor of the Derby.

  Over Easter, I went on a short trip to Amsterdam, Brussles, Mons, and
Paris and didn't see a split anywhere (it seems like all the cars are new
and small, Mercedes make a high-roof conversion van)-- But I almost
broadsided a loaf at the Arc de Triumph!

  I'm going to start working on my VW's soon, the list has given me the
inspiration I need!

Best,
joe
