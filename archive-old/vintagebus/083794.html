Subject: Re: [VB] $99,000 Westy

Yes,  but you did not &quot;PAY&quot; $100,000 for it and it is
not worth anywhere close to $100,000.  Maybe $15K now
for nice restored common `50 bug, and REALLY it was
worth even FAR less then that from
`66-`86...seriously.  Splits were nothing in
60s-`70s...even in `80s I recall decent splits for a
few thou max...

&gt; Why not drive it? My late father and I daily drove

&gt; VWs are made to be driven

&gt;  Well........there is the fact that for the last 10
&gt; years we had it that my
&gt; father and I ran a 2180 w/dual 40 IDFs, Scintilla
&gt; Mag, a Tunnel Trans (with
&gt; a very tall [Bus] 4th Gear - who needs a five
