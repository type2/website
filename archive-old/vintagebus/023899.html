Subject: Re: PIP Racks

P.I.P. made a deal with VW to make roof racks for the
New Beetle and as a condition of the deal they were to stop
manufacturing racks for the early models.  

Bummer, sounds like VW wants us all to buy a waterbug and abandon our
old projects despite the facade displayed in their print ads. Favorite
Uncle or not, they are still a corporation and don't make money
supporting the past. Oh well, that repro rack would get sheared off when
I pull into my garage anyway! I think I'll try my hand at a tubular rack
built at the same height as my pop-top ala Hoover.
