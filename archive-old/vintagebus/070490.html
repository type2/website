&gt;Have I read that it is almost impossible to get the turn signal switch??

I'm not sure about this one.  I do think there is somewhat of an
availability problem with some turn signal switches.

There has been some success reported with using contact or tuner cleaner
on balky turn signal switches.  *Don't* use WD-40 or similar oils and
solvents!  Get the right stuff from Radio Shack or a clueful hi-fi store.
Squirt it in along the stalk, towards the contacts, and work the switch
back and forth a few times to clean the contacts.  Let the cleaner
evaporate and check how well the switch works.

&gt;I believe I am in need of the &quot;whatchmacallit&quot;,,, the switch that connects
&gt;to the fuse panel,,,the little blinker box.  Maybe even another signal
&gt;lever assembly.

Go to http://www.type2_dot_com/library/electris/vw-9prong.html and do what's
in the &quot;Troubleshooting&quot; section.  It should tell you where the problem
is.  Often it's something cheap to fix, like a bad ground or loose wire
at the rear tail lights.
