Subject: Re: [VB] My old bus

What the hell?  How can you expect a 44 year old vehicle not to have
problems?

Andrew
'60 European Beetle (sale pending)
'67 Deluxe Bus
'75 914 1.8 (for sale)


&gt; his money back. The owner says no way a deal is a deal. The Dad then makes
&gt; a list of everything wrong with the bus and sends a letter to the seller
&gt; telling him he is gonna sue him because of all the things wrong with the
&gt; bus. The seller had to eventually hire a lawyer himself. They ended up
&gt; settling and he now owns the bus again. He's been keeping me updated all
&gt; along. I'll refrain from giving my opinion on lawyers...that should be
&gt; enough to let you know how I feel. But anyway....
