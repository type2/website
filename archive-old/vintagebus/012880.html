hey people... this is actually my first post, just lurking in the
wings trying to soak up as much knowledge as possible, waiting to get
a bus... and now i have.  :)  needs a lot of work, but i'm broke and
i'm just happy it runs... from what i've seen this list is a great
resource and i hope to meet some of u at various events... any advice
on local garages and such would be appreciated, as well as local
clubs.

here is my fuel to the fire... i am a mechanical engineer for the East
Bay Municipal Utility District in Oakland, CA... i do mostly
construction management and design for infrastructure improvements to
our wastewater treatment facilities... at home i do a bit of graphic
design and hopefully will get going on some product design...

later folks...

Raul
