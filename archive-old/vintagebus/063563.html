Subject: Re: [VB] '67 Model Year Questions

My 67 deluxe has VIN of 247053979. Manufactured in Nov 1966.
I am sure its a single circuit MC and it has no separate backup lights.
Could this be a 66 model year? Not what the title says...

&gt;My ex very early 67 had back ups and dual brakes only because it has M code
&gt;430. Early 67's did not come with them as standard equipment. That happened in
&gt;the middle of the 67 model year. A lot of early ones did not have either.
&gt;My 67 Standard does have 'em because it was made Feb 22, 67.
&gt;And it does not have code 430.
