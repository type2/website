Hey all,

	While doing some investigating for some parts, I came across and
internet special at Rocky Mountain Motorworks.

	They are offering 10% all instock catalog items.  From Jan
13(yeterday) to Jan 20th.  You are supposed to call a special
number..different from the one listed in the catalog, so check the website.

	I called in an order (via the wrong number) only vaguely remembering
the special, and the order taker didn't know anything about it.  But after
being transferred to a Customer service Rep, I was able to get the 10%
credited back.  Whuch was cool

	So, I figure if you plan to buy anything from them soon, use the
offer and save 10%.  www.motorworks_dot_com

	yada, yada, yada... I don't work for them...they don't always have
the best price....be sure to ask country of origin on items like
bearings....and so on, and so on....

	Now all I have to deal with is their mailing barrage of
catalogs.....
