&gt;  I am starting a project 1967 Deluxe bus, that
&gt;  has had one owner, my family. It was used to move us from San Jose CA to
&gt;  Fallon Nevada and it has sat in my parents yard unmoved since 1974. Not 
much
&gt;  rust, and not sure if engine works. 

good for you!!  :)   

ya- the engine should probably be taken apart and rebuildt- there is goop in 
there-  the case should be thouroughly cleaned- oil passages and all.    
Since it is the original motor, I would keep that engine case

I have looked at the engine, and
&gt;  taken many pictures of the bus and engine with my digital camera, for 
before
&gt;  and after pictures. I LOVE John Muir's book, and have absorbed all kinds of
&gt;  information that you have given since I got started. 
 My
&gt;  biggest concern is getting started on the engine. I am not mechanically
&gt;  inclined even thought my dad was a mechanic.
&gt;  
ya- the idiot book is very good, and written for the average non mechanic.   
Do also consider getting the 63 bently book- written for 63-67 buses, the 
reprint of the factory book, is good for all sorts of details on the body and 
wiring etc.


&gt;  I did read something lately that did sound crazy, something about Paraffin
&gt;  wax? What was that all about? I do have bolts that are going to be 
replaced,
&gt;  like shocks and such, and any help on removing those would be great. 

 yup, it works great  I had just tried it the other day and was very 
impressed.

 I don't
&gt;  think the engine has ever been taken off the bus, and everywhere I turn
&gt;  there is something that either says Made in Germany or something is in
&gt;  German. Oh, mileage is just over 71k. I have only 3 windows that are
&gt;  cracked, both front and the rear window, and only one light fixture is
&gt;  broken, the right backup light. All other lens are in perfect shape.
&gt;  Others in my family say that it is a waste of time and money to work on it,
&gt;  but I want to get it back and running right.

well, sounds worthwhile to me.  and surely to many on this list.  so you 
found a good place for support of your strange habit.   I have done lots of 
work to keep ratty buses going.  sad, huh?

dont forget to grease everything that moves.  suspension, nuts and bolts, 
mechanisms in doors, etc.
