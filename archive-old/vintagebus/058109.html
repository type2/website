Subject: RE: [VB] What is the toughest climb you ever drove?

I drove a loaded squareback from Corvallis (Go Beavers!) non-stop to
Tempe. Can't remember how long it took, but it seemed like eternity.
Especially the Ashland - Shasta leg. *shudder*

Worst one (so far) for the bus is the climb from I-10 up into Idyllwild.

I would have to agree with the I-5 Cali-Oregon border and the I-5
Grapevine:
  Same trip from Corvallis, OR to Palmdale, CA a few years back in my
'62 DC with a 1600SP and about 2600 lbs of my stuff.  Empty my truck is
2200lbs.  I checked one of the scales before leaving Oregon and it
settled on 4800lbs. The Grapevine was all second gear, with redux boxes.
