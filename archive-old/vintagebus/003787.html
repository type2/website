I don't really share this attitude. They are an imported car, after all. Saw
the same sentiment expressed about Uncle Jerry's hearse. He just imported it
from Germany a couple of years back! Many of the cool odd buses have been
imported fairly recently. If the Europeans felt the same way, there wouldn't
be any highroofs, laddertrucks, ambulances, right hand drives, Mannlifts,
'50 panels, or firetrucks here to look at. The buses can go where the most
willing buyer is and that is fair. They will sell them back when someone
here is more willing. Just saying no to a high selling price because it's
for overseas won't solve any problem, real or imagined. The next guy will
sell and the loss of one more bus will still happen. Better we spend our
energy trying to prevent the destruction of buses by 'friendly fire',
whether intentional or not. You could actually save buses that way. An
overseas buyer that spent a bundle isn't going to 'bathtub' a barndoor
deluxe, hack the engine louvers out, weld up the gates on a singlecab,
stretch a Westy and put a V8 in it, make a crewcab out of a Kombi, weld one
to the roof of a schoolbus, or just let them sit in a field and rot away to
nothing. The buses going overseas are protected, whether in the States or
not, the ones here are in the most danger.
