Subject: RE: [VB] Message to VWoA &amp; MVVC


Considering that VW doesn't want us to use their emblem, why not do what
they want?  If every VW emblem at the show was covered with black cloth,
this would send a message.  If the newspeople are present, a bit of
controversy will make a better story for them.
