hey all,
i have checked the archives and got a lot of hits but came up blank in the 
actual formula department... i have two friends that work at PPG here in 
Cleveland and they claim they can mix &quot;anything&quot;! one of them can get the 
stuff for free. the colors i want are L311 Sand Green &amp; L312 Palm Green. 
anyone got anything?
thanks in advance!!
