&gt; &gt; stop, move two feet stop until you reach the top.  Total time for this trip
&gt; was
&gt; &gt; about 30 minutes. (no lie!)  If I stopped for any length of time to allow a
&gt; gap
&gt; &gt; to develop, I got crazed drivers all the way down the hill honking at me.

&gt; Almost sounds like driving in a parade.  I bet you get more people to sign
&gt; up for parades if you offered and free clutch replacement afterwards. :-)

I would have taken a parade over that &quot;fun&quot; any time, but yes, it sounds very
similar.  In the parade is you don't have the gravity wanting to pull you back
into the float behind you.

As I neared the top of the hill, my daughter remarked &quot;wow, Dad, you're covered
in sweat!&quot;

The things we do for fun and entertainment :-).
