Subject: Re: [VB] Daily Driver Poll/Bus Sighting :p

&gt;Hate to say it, but the vintagebus_dot_com panel has been relegated to
&gt;backup, show, and Home Depot duty.   It's just not competitive in
&gt;this region's traffic environment.

The ONE time I went to California for D*sney, OCTO, The Classic, we 
took the modern mini-van. All I kept telling my wife was &quot;How the 
F*CK do they drive a VW Bus on these highways!&quot;. The Highways I was 
on in California were absolutely the worst roads I've ever driven on. 
Seems like there's so much traffic they don't have a chance to fix 
'em. People doin 90 on horribly torn up bumpy &quot;highways&quot;.

Now, once we were in Anehiem near Wally World....it was real nice! 
Just gotta stay off the highways I guess.

RR ... not missing Cali highways.
