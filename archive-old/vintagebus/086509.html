Subject: Re: [VB] RE: Carbs....was Air Cooled Rant

This is great information, and explains quite a bit, since early '65 and
later '65 (model year) makes a big(ish) difference.

I'll let folks know what the M-codes are once/if I get them. I submitted
credit card information a week ago to the museum, and have not yet been
charged. If that doesn't work, I'll fax them.

&gt; Really, really early.  There were 82,480 1965 Buses, or about 1600 Buses
&gt; a week assuming linear production.  This puts 5505 at around 3 to 4 weeks
&gt; past 1 August 1964.  Doliwa
&gt; Let us know what you find out.
