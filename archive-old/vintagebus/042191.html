&gt; George, 
&gt; The local tractor and auto supply places still have
&gt; these, the last I checked (saw one just a few weeks
&gt; ago).  New screens and gaskets available at the local
&gt; Farm and Fleet store, I just put a new screen in my
&gt; 1940 era Ford 9N tractor.  

I'll have to do some poking about.  We don't have &quot;farm and fleet&quot; here
(no farms in SoCal!) but perhaps NAPA might have one.
