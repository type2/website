Subject: Friday topic?

Did anyone else receive a post from gromow_at_uol_dot_com.br entitled &quot;Good morning! 
Open this e-mail only if you like the VW Beetle&quot;?  If so, please let me know
which of the type2 mailing lists you are subscribed to.  I think that one of
them has been harvested and a reply will let me take appropriate action. &lt;mailto:jrasite_at_eoni_dot_com&gt;
