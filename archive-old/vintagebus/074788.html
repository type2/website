&gt; I would say no they are not as valuable as an early SC- It seems to me that
&gt; SC's are on the bottom of the food chain of the commercial buses cuz there
&gt; are so many of them?

&gt; It seems to me that SCs are pretty desirable.  When I drove one (ratty),
&gt; people kept asking to buy it, even before I got it home.  Much, much more than
&gt; any 
&gt; other VW I've had.
&gt; 
Hmmmmmm.  I was thinking more in comparison to DC's, Tippers, DD panels,
sideloaders, cherry pickers etc.  It seems to moi that ratty SC's while
possibly being desirable, don't sell for much, thus the bottom of the chain
comment.
I think the general public that barely knows that SCs or DCs even exist in
relation to a bus that someone did &quot;a nice job of turning into a truck
thing&quot; will pay more for a SC/DC than the &quot;educated&quot; or &quot;informed&quot; VW
afficionado.
