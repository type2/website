Is relining unusual?  There is a place in Oly that does this (13.50 a set)   
barndoor, late bug, 65 bus, whatever .  no big deal.   BDs have the same pads 
on the metal as  58? through 68 bugs I think, 69 the bugs got larger brakes. 

...............
 After much hunting for brake shoes for my 55 BD panel, I stumbled across a

place in Ontario, Cal. that can reline them, for those that care they are;


Valley Brake

415 w. Main

Ontario, Cali.

909   988-6596
