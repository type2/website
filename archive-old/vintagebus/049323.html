I know the feeling, after spending 4 years getting 60 sunroof kombi restored its maiden voyage made it is as far as the gas station and would not restart after i shut it off. Eventually got it repaired but I know how depressing it can be. I know your 59 westy will be will worth the wait Robert when it does get back on the road.

Hey Robert,

Don't bang your head too hard against the wall.
You'll get there.

All this anticipation will just make your bus all the better when you
finally do show up.  Sure, you'll be able to point out all the flaws but
those who judge will probably not be able to point to something of theirs as
better.

Chin up!


So, where is Familienfest?  :-)
