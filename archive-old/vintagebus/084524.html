Hi Jamie,
Sounds like you connected just the starter motor to the electrical  power 
with the screwdriver.  You want to connect the small wire terminal  above those 
to the stud the battery cable is fastened to the solenoid.  13mm open wrench 
works best for us to bridge over the insulating plastic hump in  between these.
