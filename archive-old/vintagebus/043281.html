&gt; Many thanks to those who responded with backfiring suggestions, most of
&gt; which involved timing, crossed plug wires, or the valve train.  No
&gt; crossed wires, and the timing is dead on (static).  Tonite I'll check
&gt; the valve train.
&gt;
&gt; But I'm wondering if I need to tear this thing down and look closer, for
&gt; two reasons:
&gt;
&gt; 1) on reassembly, my dizzy drive shaft notch didn't line up like the
&gt; books say at TDC.  It was off by about 20degrees counterclockwise.  I've
&gt; tried puzzling out the geometry in my head and it *seems* like this is
&gt; not a problem, but to get timing right at present, the notch on the
&gt; dizzy rim points sorta towards #1 cyl.  But it's the relationship
&gt; between dizzy cam and #1 plug wire that matters, right?

As long as the rotor points to the correct cylinder at TDC between
compression and power for that cylinder AND the points have just opened,
the position of the drive gear is irrelevent.

&gt; 2) more disturbingly, this engine gets tighter and tighter.  On
&gt; reassembly everything was fine, just got progressively tighter as I
&gt; removed end play, added the pistons, torqued down the heads -- but still
&gt; was easy to turn over by hand, gripping the main crank pulley.  Now,
&gt; after running maybe 30 minutes (with the occasional backfire and cutting
&gt; out -- it will not run slow yet) it's getting very tight, and it's not
&gt; just compression.  Can't think what it is, but it's getting where the
&gt; starter will barely spin it -- and it's not the starter; I can barely
&gt; turn it with a crescent wrench on the crank pulley bolt.

Either take the plugs out or, easier, turn it backwards. If it's still
tough, take both rocker shafts off and try again. If it's still tough,
remove the engine, disassemble and find out why. Before tear down, try
checking the end-play, yes, again. Also check that the clutch wasn't
dragging on the input shaft (ie does it NOW turn freely?)

My hunch is that it's the end-play. Cupped shims in VW engines are not at
all uncommon because they are too thin and eventually distort from being
contacted unevenly (note the diameters fo the two surfaces on either side)
and especially from heavy clutches - or &quot;riding the clutch.&quot; Such shims
should be thrown out.

But who knows? It's obvious something is wrong. Find out what it is before
you run it again.
