&gt; Before you adjust you valves find what gap was there prior to your
&gt; adjustment.
&gt;  keep a history of it in a note book each time you adjust your valves.
&gt; this way you know if your valves are stretching or your rocker shaft is
&gt; loose or your cylinders are coming  loose and you act  accordingly.

And I thought I was the only one to do that!
