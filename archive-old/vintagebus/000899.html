Hi All,

I am getting ready to send off my bumpers to get straightened and I noticed
that the PO cut two nice holes in it to put a beetle muffler through it...
ughh.  Also, right in the center, there is a rather large vertical
indentation about 3/4 inch deep and 1-1 1/2 inches wide that looks too
perfect to be a dent... any thoughts or is this just a nice dent???  I've
looked in a few mags but they all look totally smooth.

Thanks again.

Dave

59 crew cab... almost in the paint shop...
