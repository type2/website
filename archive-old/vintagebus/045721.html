What I'm thinking is before 1960 the side pans were longer.

&lt;&lt; My '60 (11/59) DD does *not* have the extra outriggers, and the belly pans
of course only span the jack points.

So what you're saying, is the 'earlier' buses had longer outer pans than 
inner?
There isn't a center chassis section to go with the last set of outriggers.
