Subject: Swing axle rear lowering kit.By WOLFGANG
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

    I Need some information on this ad. by Wolfgang for a rear lowering kit. 
It say it eliminates reduction boxes. Will that Make a difference on the 
FREEWAY?
      I'm building a 1835cc for my 65' Dlx. I don't won't the engine to heat 
up when I'm on the freeway will this work? Or what would be the best way to 
go about it.  Aloha Mike
