&gt; back to the end-play shims....i think i understand where they should go.I
&gt; don't remember ever having seen them when taking my engine out(removing
clutch
&gt; flywheel etc...) what are the side effects of running an engine without
these
&gt; shims? is that possible, or would the engine not run at all? i'm wondering
if
&gt; i just missed seeing them in my engine, or they aren't there at all and i
am
&gt; causing engine damage with all my driving...

It ain't a side effect, the patient croaks. The shims work like a gear
reduction. If your flywheel thrust surface rubbed directly on the thrust
surface of the front main bearing, it would see one revolution of wear for
each revolution. With steel against aluminum, say about a hundred turns
before she is all ate up. So you take 3 shims and put them in there. Not 2,
not 4, but 3(three). So the flywheel rubs against the first shim. Say it
turns once for each two revs of the flywheel. Okey dokey, then it in turn
rubs against the second shim. One for two again. Now the second shim rubs
against the third shim, half speed again. Now this third shim, it rubs
against the thrust surface of the forward main bearing, which by this point
thinks it is still relaxing in the garage. I am sure that as sure as God
made little green apples someone will write in with the corrected
mathematical reduction of this formula, so I won't be a show-off and tell
you, but it is enough. 22 million engines can't be wrong. All of this fine
reduction really only comes into play when the clutch pedal is depressed
assuming all things are in order, endplay properly set, cable adjusted
properly, clutch disk floating properly on tranny input shaft splines, and
so forth. This complicated process also only works with proper endplay
setting. Not enough and there is no room for an oil film between the shims
and we all know what that means. They don't rotate on each other and the
bearing is soon fused to the flywheel with a mangled washer looking thing in
between. This is also why we never ever touch the clutch pedal when we are
firing up our fresh rebuild engine. We wouldn't want all of these shims and
bearing surfaces to meet without the presence of oil, would we? No we
wouldn't. So, the odds are very good if you are still driving, that you have
shims. Whether there are the right amount I can't say. Also, for those of
you that didn't already know this, this is why you don't sit through red
lights with the clutch pedal depressed. You are working those poor shims
half to death for nothing. I think that covers it, so I'll shut up now.
