 NEW FIND in the attic or garage. How do you miss 3 nos bumpers in the corner

when I finally moved all my crap out of my parents house(years after I'd 
left) I found  enough glass to do 3/4 of a deluxe bus, a middle seat, a 
deluxe rear bumper, and a disasembled tranny I didn't know I had. on the 
other hand That rear seat kick pannel I distinctly remeber being there was no 
where to be found. every one remebers different things. I know I personally 
dont have enough brain cells left in the old noggin to remember it all.
