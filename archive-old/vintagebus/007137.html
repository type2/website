You want it to last? POR-15

As far as cylinders? replacing the entire set-up wouldn't hurt although it
all depends on finances.

I would do complete overhaul even going into troubles of replacing master
with the newer version. You want to make sure you stop.

&gt; Question is what should I do for the
&gt; newly sandblasted backing plates?  I figured I have
&gt; three options: Powder coating, Zinc primed and
&gt; rattle-canned, or POR-15.  (What color?  I thought
&gt; plain old gloss black)  There is no rust, so I'm not
&gt; really inclined to do the POR-15 route.  This will be
&gt; my daily ride, so I wanted the coating to last, what
&gt; ever it may be.  Also, should I try to rebuild the
&gt; cylinders, or just buy new ones?
