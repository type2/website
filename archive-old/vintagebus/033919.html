Hello,

This is only a preliminary price check for now.  I am sure  
that with some digging I can do better than this but at least
those that posted to me will have some idea as to cost.

Upper inner bearing  311-501-283  3/55-7/67   $30  SKF/FAG
Lower inner bearing   (same as above)
Upper outer bearing  211-501-285  3/55-7/67   $18  SKF/FAG
Lower outer bearing  211-501-283  8/63-7/67   $60  SKF/FAG

Obviously this is not a complete listing nor is it thorough 
search at this time.  You'll still need the axle gasket/seal kit 
or around $5 per side (311-598-051).  And I need to get either 
the VW part number for the stub axle O-ring for the post-64's 
or at least its true size to price that out.  Right now I do not 
have a source for the 'freeze plugs' behind the lower inner ball 
bearing but I have heard that some of the Bus specific parts 
shops in California have the metal ones for around $15 ea.  
There are plastic ones available as well but I would prefer to 
use the original style metal one if available.  Usually you can
weld a nut onto the backside of that plug and using a slide
hammer pop it right out w/o any damage.  Just grind the nut
off, clean it up, splooge it with some sealer, and reinstall.

I'll continue looking and see if I can come up with better prices.
When I called today these prices were for one or two only of
each and over the counter full-bore retail prices.  There is power
in mass quantities so if I were to put together some kits I would
order a couple of dozen each and that will bring prices down.
Also, there are some non-SKF or FAG bearings out there at
reduced pricing and I will check into those as well.  I'll stay
away from mainland China, Russia, or some other country with
an unknown (or known!) track record.  I would think that name
brand bearings from Japan would be OK.  There are a bazillion
Japanese cars out there running Japanese bearings and they
seem to do just fine.  Besides, most of the SKFs and FAGs
aren't made in Germany anymore anyway.  

Talk to you later
