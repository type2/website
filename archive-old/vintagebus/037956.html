&lt;&lt; Doesn't Audi use the same symbol as Auto Union?  By
 the way, who were the members of that? VW, BMW,
 Porsche and Audi? &gt;&gt;

It is the same symbol and company, more or less.
The German companies Wanderer, Horch, DKW and Audi merged in 1932 using the 
four interlocking circles to symbolize the joining together of the 
manufacturers. Auto Union was bought by VW in the 60's and the name was 
changed to just Audi sometime later.
