Subject: Insurance

I&quot;m looking for good leads for an auto Insurance company that will insure a 
daily driver classic vehicle for it's real world value and at a good annual 
rate. I checked Hagerty, but they seem to be restricted a bit much. If my 
wife was on the policy, we'd have to have an extra vehicle for me and for 
her on top of my bus. Any other suggestions?
