&lt;&lt; Hi there,  saw your message about evenly spacing the T/O bearing.  How
      is this accomplished? &gt;&gt;
Hi Ray,
Well if there is very little to move it (Less than 1/32&quot;.) you can bend the
arms slightly enough to the one side to place the bearing evenly to the input
shaft.  If more movement is needed then you need to find or make washer/s to
spacer the whole throw out arm to one side.  Eric&amp;Barb
