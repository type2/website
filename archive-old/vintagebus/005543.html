Dewayne-
If the white haze is inside the glass, no. Laminated
Safety glass has two panels with a plastic core.
If it is on the surface, try CLR ( Calcium, Lime, Rust )
available in grocery/hardware stores, full strength.
Otherwise, you will need to get cesium oxide from
a jeweler's supply source or Eastwood, and polish it off
with a buffing pad. polarized sunglasses will help to
make it more visible.

Subject: [VB] Cleaning nasty glass
&gt;    I am seeking advise about how to clean the glass in the 65 that I am
&gt;working on. The bus was pulled from a field here in Oklahoma after
&gt;sitting 28 years and the glass has a crusty coating on it. The coating
&gt;is a slight whitish hazing that resembles lime deposit in a shower.
&gt;I tried using some household cleaners with minimal success.
&gt;Is there a product or procedure(polishing, etc.?) that will remove the
&gt;coating and clear the glass up again?
