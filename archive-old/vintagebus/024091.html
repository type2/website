Subject: re;engine out-must do's

everyone forgot to tell you the most important thing to do
i personally always retorque the cyclinder heads every time
i have an engine out, it's the best insurance since you allready
have the engine out, replace seals (oil cooler, unless it's been
done recently and there is no sighs of leaks) you already will have the
tin off
and do everything else everyone else said.
