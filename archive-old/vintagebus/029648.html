Subject: FLAPS Oil Cooler Fraud.

    went down to the local import FLAPS last week to buy a doghouse oil
cooler for the current vw-motor-on-the-stand...
    it was like $68 and some change... and i specified that the oil
cooler must be new...
    not recon... new. new new new.
    it was painted gray... and i had some hesitation about buying it
given this condition, but thrice was i assured that it was new... and
since i do a lot of business with the place in question, i went ahead
and got it...
    my bad....
    there was one spot on the cooler where paint was not... and you
could see the aged aluminum... you could also see where the old foam
insulation was glued on... disintegrated, fell away, and was
subsequently painted battleship gray... i should have paid better
attention, i guess.. woops.
    the real breathtaking giveaway was in the cleaning... brake cleaner
followed by shop air one side, rag at the other.... old motor oil and
*chunky bits* came out.... mmmmm nice.
    not what you'd want in any motor....
    so i took it back.... i told the guy that i wanted not my money
back, but a real brand new oil cooler.... i had purchased one there
before that was the bona fide deal.... but i suppose his suppliers have
sadly lapsed into mediocrity... but i had to settle for getting my money
back....
    but.... i'd say there's a batch of these out there waiting to burn a
bunch of us vw owners.... stay away from the gray paint.
