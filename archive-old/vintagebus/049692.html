Hey Volks

Old fuel in a 30-PICT carb turned to glue and blocked all the drilled
internal passages. I tried all the usual solvents on the residue, but to no
avail.

Is their some secret cleaner that can unblock all the tiny passages in a
carb, or should I just toss it and buy a new Brazilian 31-PICT?
