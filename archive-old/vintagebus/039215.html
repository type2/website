yeah, it fell below $2/gallon here.  whoo-hoo.


today I was pleasently supprised to find that regular gas has dropped to
$1.50 a gallon, last week it was $1.69 at the same location. Does anybody
else see this trend in falling fuel prices. If they keep dropping I might
make even more long distance road trips to VW shows.
