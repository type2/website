Subject: Welder Gas
Mime-Version: 1.0

I finally got gas for my lincoln sp-100t welder. I bought the welder a few 
months back, but only just now had the money to get the gas. It cost me 
almost $200 for a tank full of gas!!! That was mainly the cost to buy the 
actual tank. Luckily it's only $40 to get it refilled. At least it's done.
