Thanks bob,

That is really cool, i've been looking for those and now you have found
them for us :)

as an aside, my halogen experiment was a flop.  Both of em burned out in a
couple of weeks, i dont know if it was heat or voltage fluctuations (i
was having charging system problems) but they werent as hardy as i would
have liked.

LED's seem like a much better solution.

thanks,

Steve
