Subject: Clutch Throwout Shaft stuff.
Message-ID: &lt;19990308033932.13787.rocketmail_at_attach1.rocketmail_dot_com&gt;

The following was done on a B*g, but splittys and early loafs have the
same parts...

A couple of weeks ago I replaced a clutch cross shaft, which had
suffered a failure of the end where the bearing rides.  End of story,
right?  Not likely!

Wife comes home from work and tells me that the clutch cable seems to
be failing.  I drive car and, sure enough, it feels like the cable is
graunching somewhere along its length.  Funny thing was, when the
engine was off it was smooth as silk.  Hmmmmm.

I finally figured out that it must be the throwout bearing going
south. Kicked myself for not replacing it when the engine was out. 
Dropped engine today to fix the problem.

Turned out that the problem was that the snap ring that lives just
inboard of the left hand bushing had gotten out of its slot, allowing
the entire shaft to move to the left.  The out-of-center bearing was
making the nasty noise.  In the meantime it also ground out its center
on the input shaft, shedding the shield that protects the ball bearing.

Fix was to get new snap rings and install them securely.  I used thin
safety wire through the snap-ring holes and then used a small carbide
bit in a Dremel tool to carve a relief &quot;dent&quot; in the thrust washer
that lives between the snap ring and bushing.  This allows clearance
for the safety wire.  An even better idea would be to make a larger
diameter and thickness washer with an indentation that captures the
snap ring, but my shop lacks a lathe! 

I also safety-wired the clips that secure the bearing to the arm.  Ran
a loop of wire through the loops of the clips and then around the
bearing in the slots around the outer aspects.  VWs have gone
thousands of miles without doing this, but it just feels a bit more
secure.

Moral of the story:  Always use new snap rings!
