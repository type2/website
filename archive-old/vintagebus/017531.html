As a shot in the dark is anyone from Phoenix area or
passing through Phoenix going to the Familienfest and
Pomona?
I specifically would like to hook up with anyone
taking a vehicle that could tow the '54 barn on a
Uhaul 2 wheeled dolly. Will pay a good portion of the
fuel bill or negotiate a flat fee. No relative owns a
Suburban or V8 pick up truck or I'd be all over it. We
have already checked with all of the rental places and
no one allows towing with a rental truck smaller than
an apartment building.
Misc. family logistics makes it tough to plop the 7
month old in it and head out. I'd do it solo anytime
but am trying to make a family weekend at the 2 shows.
Would like to have the 54 barney at Pomona.
Contact me privately ASAP if possible.

America West weekender special from Phoenix to
SanDiego = $69.00 roundtrip... $79.00 to Albuquerque
if I had business there.
