 Yes.  It was usually made from the same material as the front seats.
 I have the ones from the '54 and the '60.  I can't enumerate the

the tools that came with the bus yes came in a tools roll made out of seat 
material- the stuff the sides of the seat were made of- and the tools 
included are listed in the back of the owners manual for that year.
