From what I understand, the Beetle book has been in the works since before
June of last year (I recieved my copies over a month ago). Every VW book
will eventually be published. The bus manuals have been on the list of 2
do's for over a year, the parts list books have also been given
consideration. Thom's info given to Bentley has hopefully stepped up the
publishing date, the detering factor is the decenters who have said (to
Bentley) that it would be a waste of time to publish the pre 64 book and
should do the 59 or earlier book, which has created some second thoughts on
Bentleys end. There philosphy is to publish books by a series of dates and
not hop around and publish odd series. Keep your fingers crossed and I will
post when I recieve the publish date.

No hard news from Bentley yet.  I sent them my 1955 and 1953/54 
(that's what it sez on the cover) manuals, and they're going to
poke at them and figure something out.  What ya wanna bet that
a portion of their decision hinges on the success of thr '58-'60
bug manual?

&gt; We finally have filled the gap in our Beetle workshop manual line.
&gt; After 40 years, the VW official 1958-1960 workshop manual is
&gt; again in print.&lt;&lt;&lt;

&gt; 
&gt; How far behind this  could a early bus maual be
&gt; in Bentley's corperate planning?
&gt; Any buzz on this?
