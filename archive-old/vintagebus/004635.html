Does anyone know if there is such a thing as a 6V alternator for a VW
engine?  I know the alternators for VW came out well after VW went to 12V
but I bet there is someone someplace that has one.

BTW:  In the event that I can't find a 6V alternator and have to go with a
6V generator, is there anyone on here that would like to sell me a good used
6V generator?  (As in after you converted to 12V,  you have this good used
6V generator laying around...&quot;
