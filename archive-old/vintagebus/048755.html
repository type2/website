Subject: Saturday morning vw toys and stuff...

Once every 1 or 2 months we pack up the family on Saturday morning 
and hit some of the local junk shops and flea markets. Of course I 
always look for anything VW.. With the help of my 3 year old son, 
I've done pretty good. I always seem to come home with something.

Today I found a real cool big Solido Coke delivery bus still new in 
the box. I guess it's the 1:18 scale. Real neat. Got it for $15.00. 
Also found a pinkish purple flower power looking Lledo bus. It's 
smaller, but bigger than a matchbox car. Got that one for $5. Also 
got a neat assortment of bugs and one of those kublewagens from the 
70's. One of the bugs is a redline hotwheels from the 70's I think.

Lots of fun. It is a waste of money. But at least I've got junk to 
show for it. Beats the heck out of going to the movies or something. 
At this point I've got so many VW toys and memorabilia I could 
probably sell them on ebay and buy a real nice bus...or at least take 
a big hunk out of the price.
