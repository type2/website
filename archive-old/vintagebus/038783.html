&gt; Did you feel through the headliner (if it is there) to see if all the wood
&gt; is in place? There are 3 wood bows that go from side to side and 2 that go
&gt; lengthwise along the pop top. Also if you pull the gray plastic trim piece
&gt; (I sell those, shameless plug) there should be a piece of plastic stiping
&gt; there that is stapled through to hold the canvas to the wood. I have a
&gt; complete westy wood bow set and the pop top for that matter, heck even the
&gt; roof clip with the hole in it, with these items I would find it very easy to
&gt; instal the top. It would appear that Westy put the wood frame work in first,
&gt; then cut the hole for the top, then very carefully (ya right) bent the lip
&gt; of the roof up with some sort of cust pliers, more like a hammer and dolly
&gt; the way my roog clip looks.
&gt; 
&gt; So what it could boil down to is, does it look like the headliner was ever
&gt; replaced? and are all wood pieces in place??  It would be nearly impossible
&gt; to install all 3 wood pieces without removing the headliner, but you could
&gt; get 2 of them in.

IT LOOKS LIKE THE ORIGINAL HEADLINER!  BUT I'LL HAVE TO SEE IF THE WOOD IS
THERE POSSIBLY THRU THE NEARBY TEAR WHICH I AM PLANNING ON SEWING UP.
ANYONE HAD ANY LUCK W/ THIS?
&gt; 
&gt; More research, but who cares it sounds like a really cool bus.

  YEA, I'M THINKING THE $900 WAS WORTH IT, EVEN THOUGH I HAD TO SMILE WHEN
&quot;THE WIFE&quot; BROUGHT HOME 2- 5 YEAR OLD SAMOYEDS AT THE SAME TIME I BROUGHT
THE DELUXE HOME.  WONDER WHICH AQUISITION WILL END UP COSTING MORE TO
MAINTAIN???!!!!!

&gt; When I was at Bad Camberg there were quite a few Deluxe Campers, but most of
&gt; those had DEVON camper kits, they are very cool because some of the cabinets
&gt; have roll up doors like on an old desk and beautiful woodwork!

&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks for all the feedback on the SO-42/clamshell lights/Deluxe issues!  I
&gt; am still puzzled(not hard to do!) about the installation of the poptop in
&gt; the existing roof of the Deluxe.  If you look at factory poptops, there is a
&gt; very smooth curved bend in the roof metal that sticks up about 1/2&quot; around
&gt; the opening and has a crimped edge of the metal bent back to the outside of
&gt; the roof.  Then the canvas is attached to this &quot;curb&quot; at this point which
&gt; keeps the joint up off the roof and makes a good positive seal to keep water
&gt; out. My Deluxe has this same detail as other factory poptops I have
&gt; physically compared it too.  Can this be done in the field?  I have seen
&gt; some of the American camper conversions, and they didn't even try this
&gt; detail(just cut a hole in the roof and relied on caulking to keep the rain
&gt; out!) so I am perplexed as to how this would have been done by a PO at some
&gt; time instead of Westy?
&gt; Anyone have any insight on this?  On the other hand, the hole in the floor
&gt; for the water tank drain, appears to have been cut w/ a torch.  Would Westy
&gt; have done that?
&gt; 
&gt; Again thanks for the responses!
&gt; 
&gt; Tom,
