Subject: VintageBus archive fixed

All,

The VintageBus archive at type2_dot_com is back in operation.  It was
fixed by early Friday morning (May 11), so if you haven't tried it
since then, you may wish to try again.

The problem came from the fact that I had hard-coded type2_dot_com's IP
address in the document database.  I originally did this because of
apparent problems with the name server when the database was indexed;
it didn't like 30,000 requests to resolve www.type2_dot_com.  :)  Using
the hard-coded IP was fine until we had to move the server, at which
point it broke.  It is still hard-coded to the new address but there
have been other changes made -- the next time the server moves, the
archives should only be down for a few hours instead of several days.

I apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused.  Thanks for 
bearing with us!

Matt Roberds
