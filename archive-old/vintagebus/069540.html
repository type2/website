Subject: RE: [VB] Non-walk-thru  boom boom 

There used to be a base unit that sat in the rim itself, not the highest
quality pounder, but best of both worlds, if they are still made. This is
crutchfield ala 5 years ago, should fall right into a 14-15 vw rim.

Hey Adrian,

I've been toying with this idea as well but was just going to throught a
stock spare with a smaller tire in behind the seat and a 12 inch tube under
the rear camper seat.  Let me know how this goes, it appears that some of us
are interested.

&gt; I am hoping to place a single 12&quot; sub in that spot with a custom
enclosure.
&gt; Probably a sealed cabinet for clarity over boom-boom.  Nothing fancy.
