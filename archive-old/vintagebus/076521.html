Subject: J-Tubes - Avail. In Reg. or Stainless Steel

&gt; i was wondering if it was possible to drive my bus around 
&gt; without the heater boxes ( heat exchangers?) and still have 
&gt; an exaust system hooked up.


Yes, you need a pair of &quot;J tubes.&quot;  We sell a standard pair and a
Stainless Steel pair.  For short-term use like yours, you'll only need
the cheap ones ($13 a pair). They're not top quality but will serve the
purpose for a year or two at a very low cost.  For long-term use the
stainless ones are worth the difference; they're $89 a pair but
infinately higher quality. (Like anything else, you get what you pay
for.)  Indicidentally, the stainless ones are now discontinued, so once
they're gone we won't be able to get them again.
