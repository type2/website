&lt;&lt; Well, I'm looking at some of the 'new' Mexican engines, GEX seems decent:
 Hyd lifters,unleaded heads,etc with 12/12 warranty for 1,199. Mofoco has
 'new' Mexican 1600DP for 1,350. Strictly Foreign has a new 1600DP for 1,259
 with a 24/24 warranty and no core charge . These all sound pretty good,
 warranty on the SF engine looks tempting. Seems like it would be wiser  to
 go for the new engine since the prices aren't all that far apart. So... any
 suggestions?
  &gt;&gt;

Keep in mind the warranty is only good if you don't mind pulling the motor, 
crating it up, and sending it back!
