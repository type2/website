There was a posting to a link in a down-under (Aussies I believe) that showed 
the welding of plates with backup nuts. I seem to remember that this is a 
legal requirement.
I am certainly tempted to do this to my 63 singlecab in the reconstruction 
phase.
But the singlecab can use the hardpoints where the latches are for the 
forward edge of the gates. It still needs a reinforced plate for the bottom 
parts.

I Will post pictures when it is complete.
