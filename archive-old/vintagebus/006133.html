When installing a engine I always chew gum so when I get to this half-moon
bolt you stick the gum around the bottom of the head of the bolt and then
push it in.  that way you can get around to the engine side of the bolt you
can get it started with out the bolt sliding into the hole to far to get the
nut started.

, a few on the list have suggested using tape or some type of silicone
&gt; sealant upon re-installing...with the thinking being-if you ever really
have
&gt; to get the bolt out, the tape or sealant are not too permanent. There is
also
&gt; a halfmoon bolt that can replace the bolt above the starter, this is
supposed
&gt; to catch on something near it-it doens't on my engine...
&gt;
&gt; good luck. I think I usually spend about 30-45 minutes trying to get those
two
&gt; top bolts out(that includes trying to find someone to stick their arm in
my
&gt; greasy engine compartment)
