Subject: Re: [VB] rubber undercoat in doors?

Jason,

I used black POR15 during my restoration, and the doors are absolutely
sealed and waterproof. Any other sealer should be carefully checked for
proper adhesion to the inner door surface. POR is really good for this
purpose - Ronnie sells it, as does POR-15 company.

&gt; Hey everyone...
&gt;
&gt; I wonder if you could insulate the inside panels of
&gt; your doors/ body panels this way. Has anyone tried
&gt; this?  Would it be a smart way to keep water from
&gt; ruining the bottom inside of your cab doors?
&gt;
&gt; What do you guys/gals think?
