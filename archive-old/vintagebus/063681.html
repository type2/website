Subject: Re: [VB] Hey, all

take that number and a token handle or so to your local good locksmith.  
preferably one that has been around for a while- they have the key codes for 
cars, and can look up 67 VW bus, you particular key code, and the books will 
say what shape the key should be.  Check the cut key actually works the 
handle.  If it doesn't, either the handle has been altered, or the key was 
cut wrong, but odds are you'll be fine.
Cost- about $15 for two keys cut to code

 Hi! 
 This is my first post. As suggested I have been receiving the mail now for 
 several weeks and have been loving every minute of it! 
 
 I have '67 deluxe project that is just starting to take off. I am not 
 unfamiliar with the beautiful air cooled VW, but this is my first type ll.
 
 I need to get keys for my bus, as it had none when I bought it. I took the 
 ignition switch and door handles out and they are all stamped with the same 
 number. Does this mean that I can just order new keys from a good VW parts 
 supplier with this number?
 
 Thanks for all the good information!
 
 -Greg
