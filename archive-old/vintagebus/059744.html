Subject: Jerome &amp; Harry Houck

Harry p-mail me with your address, have some &quot;classy&quot; Jerome pics for you.
Where did you and Carl go?
Jerome was GREAT this year. More &quot;laid back and cool&quot; as Ellis would say. No
worries at all. Thanks to the ABC for the best Jerome ever in my opinion,
and I have been there from the beginning. Thanks to the Terrible 2's and
J.P. for Sun. DeDe, Denise and I both owe you forever, thanks again.
 The trip through the dez was PERFECT for the 2 buses that went. We covered
74 miles in 5 hours and had a blast, no getting towed by the Bronco. Want to
see more buses next year. Ronnie and his group still have to learn how to
read a map. They missed the Seligman turn and went through the red clay
mudboggs and finally called for help. Great offroad trip from Ashfork to
Jerome, 9 buses. Covered the 34 miles in a little over 2 hours. A must do
next year for all of you who have the time. Hope to see all at BBB this
year.
