Contrary to popular legend, it *is* possible to be a VW enthusiast *without*
being a redneck/druggie/hippie/deadhead/misfit/burnout with 10 cars in various
states of disrepair in the front yard.

There are too many car enthusiasts in general that take on more projects
than they can afford, either time or money wise, which sit out front for 
months or years with no forward progress.  Some of these people have
months issue with dismembering a car in the front yard, leaving the 
carcass there, only to drag home another.  It looks like *crap*.  
There is nothing beautiful or noble about  a car dismembered in someones 
driveway, I don't care if it's a pinto or a '51 deluxe.

You need to conform to the environment around you.  If you do not like
the environment around you, you need to change - the environment is not
going to change for you.  When it snows, you put on a coat, or move.
You do not petition the coulds to allow you to roam naked.  If you're in
a neighborhood that doesn't like project cars, then move.  I recently
moved, and one of the criteria was finding a neighborhood that wasn't
too uppity and &quot;neat&quot; that wouldn't wouldn't mind too terribly if I 
wrenched on my buses.  If you want to have cars on your front lawn, move 
to where everyone else has cars on their front lawn.  It's that simple.
I don't park my projects on the street or in the driveway, and I don't expect
my neighbors to do the same.  I don't pee in your porridge, and I expect you
not to pee in mine.

I think a lot of people bite off way more than they can chew on some of these 
projects, in terms of what their neighborhood, wallet &amp; SO 
can withstand.  Taking on a project incurs responsibilities that
a lot of would-be restorers don't take into consideration.  Like:

&quot;where will this thing sit while I'm working on it&quot; 
	ie people forget that when you dismember a car, the parts have to go
*somewhere*
&quot;who will I be inconveniencing while I work on it&quot; - 
	ie SO's car loses it's garage berth
&quot;how much work can I get accomplished in a given time frame&quot;
	ie don't strip the damn thing to a bare chassis if you're not
going to be able to afford to paint it for 5 years
&quot;how much will this cost me&quot;
	ie if will I be able to eat and feed the kids and buy the parts, or
will the kids go hungry in favor of NOS splash pan seals.  Come up with
an estimate, then tripplie it.  Now double that number.  you're almost there..
&quot;do I have the skills for this?&quot;
	ie learning as you go is one thing, but be realistic about your
abilities and don't underestimate the learning curve
&quot;What the hell will I do with this when I'm done?&quot;
	ie I can't even answer this question
