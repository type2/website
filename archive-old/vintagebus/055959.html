Subject: Re: [VB] Crew Cab Body Panels

&gt; I have a '67 crew cab that needs COMPLETE rocker panel replacement.  I am
&gt; about to acquire a welder, is this something that I can accomplish? Or
does
&gt; this job need to be left to the proffesionals (sp)?

If you are going to get a welder, learn to use it &quot;before&quot; you start a
project like this. When I was learning to weld, I ruined a lot of metal
before I got it right.

Also, you will need more than a welder to do this job. A nice tool to have
for this kind of project is a air saw. It is a small reciprocating saw that
makes a very fine, even, detailed cut. This is handy when cutting-out the
bad rockers. You will also need an electric grinder and a flanging tool to
make a flange in the replacement rocker.

Another thing, check your inner rockers. When the outer rockers are gone,
the inner rockers are usually gone as well.

I think Thom has a series on replacing rockers on his web site.
