Subject: Re: [VB] Cooling/Do side scoops work????
To: Oldscholvw_at_aol_dot_com, vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

Hi I foun dthis in my outgoing mail box, so here it is:

There is tons in the archives about side scoops. check it out.   I think they 
are ugly (U. G. L. Y. you ain't got no alibi, you're ugly), and took them off 
my daily driver.  Heard things both ways about whether they help or not, I 
really don't know.

But,   have you done other things to keep your bus cool?  like

Make sure all the connections from fresh air tubes through to heater boxes 
are secure, you can lose a lot of cooling are through there

Good engine to body seal?

Good engine compartment seal?  This is a big deal, really increasing air 
pressurisation in engine compartment.  good for getting you warm in winter 
too (more heat volume)

extra holes in cooling tin?  plug them like if you have those open holes for 
preheat, etc.  get a pop can or two and plug them.

wash your motor, high pressure under neath and up around the cylinders by the 
push rod tubes there.  A clean motor is a cooler motor

Tune up? (wash motor/engine compartment first, your SO will appreciate it) 

Pull the spark plug wires one at a time off the dist then replace it, so you 
see how it sounds running on each combination of 3 cylinders?  If removing a 
wire makes no difference, is it not firing on that cylinder.  removing each 
should sound the same.

Doghouse?  if not, consider a switch, though that's more hassle.  I did the 
type IV doghouse swap and am very happy with it.  saw 10-20F drop in freeway 
temps over regular doghouse.

that's my advice if you are worried about it running hot.

 month going up Interstate 5......thats a 4000 ft climb,,,,,,and it can be 
HOT 
 100 degrees plus, 400 miles each way.......
 
 not sure what size the motor is as it came in the bus......1600cc or larger
 The bus already has the holes for the scoops .......
 
 so has anyone really tested these scoops ? or is it &quot;old wifes tales&quot;
 
 and no I am not going to cut out the wheelwells and put chrome reverse Chevy 
 rims with adapters.............Or a big 8 track in the dash.............
