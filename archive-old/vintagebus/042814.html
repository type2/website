Subject: Safari Standoff, proper alignment question

Hey splitnosers;

  I got some bronze L-shaped standoffs for my safari wiper arms (to use
with the one-eyed duck) so you can move the wipers out of the way [without
losening the allen set screws] to open the windows.  Although I've got an
idea on how they work, I want to ask the list first so I don't break the
wiper arms testing my theory.  The bronze L-shaped standoff has a round
male pin (secondary wiper shaft; with the allen set screw) that is held on
by an e-clip giving 1/16&quot; room to pull up and disengage the female post
hole (for the allen set screw) which holds the primary wiper shaft. There
is no spring mechanism on these standoffs, just that little bit of free
play when you pull up on them.  The question is what is the way you put
these on?  My guess is the cradle on the bronze L-shaped gets forced in
the wiper arm (but this will affect or ruin the spring mechanism?)  I'm so
confused--how do these go on?  Anybody have these on theirs?

  Also, what is the correct position for the one-eyed duck?
