Hi Stephen;

A little &quot;off-roading to get a good spot for lunching?????&quot;
OK...sure there wasn't some good looking colleague from accounting or
maybe some administrative specialist from marketing along for the ride???
Regardless of the circumstances of your little adventure, I must admit that you

do know how to write an attention-getting headline.
Sorry about the rock, but I am suspicious of the distraction that caused this
bus-damaging incident. ;-)   =&gt;  (now there's an emoticon for you John).
