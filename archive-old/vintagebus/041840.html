&gt; That's nothing, to quote old VW deluxe bus ad copy
&gt; &quot;...You can even fit a playpen or crib in the back
&gt; without removing any of the seats (what better way to
&gt; transport a sleeping baby?)...&quot;

Then there was the DDB Bug ad that read, in part: &quot;...and you can sleep an
enormous baby behind the rear seat!&quot;

Ah, what it was like to live free!
