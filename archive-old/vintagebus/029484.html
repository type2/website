Subject: Whats in your parcel tray?

Well...the content of my parcel tray changes rather frequently.  Right now I
have 2 bottles of touch up paint.  One primer and one white.  I've a few
lighters back there, a few slips of paper with people's phone numbers on
them....bus people that i meet here and there.    I've a tape player/radio
crammed in there, a voltage drop or two from when the bus was converted to
12V, I think the original owners manual is in there from when i last went to
a show, some pens, tapes, and a few of the interior panel screws...as mine
like to come out every once in a while.  I've a truck-style seat cover for my
front seat too...and that has big pockets all along the front bottom part of
the seat...so theres a few things in there too.  Soon to be another little
notebook up there for gas mileage...as my gas gauge quit on my the other day
:(  Shawn says he has a little book up there for that, but I think its just a
cover up for whats *really* in there. Its ok shawn, I won't tell sarah ;-)
ahh yes...and the newest addition.  My bus journal...
It sounds like a lot of stuff...but my bus is suprisingly clean.  I keep my
buses cleaner than say....my room.  The buses get a little messy
sometimes...but I clean it up pretty quickly.
Now I'm trying to find yet another engine for the 62.  The 40hp that I put in
there now burns oil and leaks it...and slings it out from behind the pulley
...but it doesn't do it all the time?  hmmmm... it started smoking right
after I did an oil change.  geeeeeez...talk about ticked off.
ahhh well...

Take it easy, and happy friday!
I'm off to a bus campout today!  Wahooooo!!
