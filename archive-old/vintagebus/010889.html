&gt; Thank you for your replies.  Does this mean that this happens to
&gt;  everyone that has split bus?  Is'nt there anything else I can do?  I
&gt;  live in Hawaii, and even mornings do not ever get that cool.  You'd
&gt;  think the vent on the fuel filler cap would let enough gas escape?  Did
&gt;  VW ever address this in any of their manuals?  Hmmmm..   --J.D.
&gt;  

today I was sitting in the shade outside the cafe for an hour this afternoon, 
doing the crossword and drinking coffee.  My bus was tilted towards the gas 
cap side.  It did smell of gas when I got in.   (no gas guage sender- it's a 
61)  (vented cap)  Thought of this thread and checked my notes- it had been 
43 miles since I filled it up.   It's just a heat thing.  Does not do this in 
the cool weather.
