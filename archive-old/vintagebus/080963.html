Subject: manual choke installl in 60-67 bus?

hey i'm wanting to put a manual choke carb in my 65 bus, which has the dumb 
stock electric choke, which doesn't allow for variations in weather.  Choke's 
usually on too long or not enough.    So I just ordered a 1600 sp carb w/ 
manual choke from bus depot (~$80.. good deal).... need to find me a new choke 
cable to put in... hmm

http://www.wolfsburgwest_dot_com/cart/DetailsList.cfm?ID=111711501A    
does $22.50 seem high?

any tips on installation I should be aware of??   WW lists a bunch of seals 
they think it should have as well...   ????? which add up at $3 ea.

Clara
