This is probably more of a friday topic, but I thought I'd post it
anyway.
Do any listees have custom personalised number plates.
I'm going to get some for my '61, but haven't decided what to get.
I'm thinking on TYP2 61.
I had SPLIT1 on my '67, and KOMBI on my '73 camper.
Suggestions appreciated
Daniel
