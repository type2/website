Subject: (VB) RE: seat belts

Based on Matt Roberds reference:

http://www.roaminangelsinc_dot_com/HTMLS/Sep05/BeltLess.html

it appears a safe bet that 1962 was the year they became mandatory
for the front at least (minimum requirement) in California.
My 1963 15 window (walk-through) has what appears to be dealer installed
belts in the front. The '63 transporter owners manual (February 1963 edition)
page 19, state's &quot;safety belts are available at your VW &quot;service station&quot;.
It apears they were only available for the driver and front passenger.
As a side note. In 1966 I purchased a brand new deluxe bug from Truman
Motors in El Cajon, California. I was in the Navy at the time, stationed at
NAS Miramar, north of San Diego. The car came with seat belts, front and
back.
