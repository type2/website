&gt; Look for the olive green ones. We just gave away one that was ugly but

&gt; rid of the green and rusty red ones too.


I'm renovating my kitchen and will probably have a nice oversized oven
(with attached stove) in the rusty red color avaliable in a few months,
haven't tried to sell it maybe I have an excuse to keep it. would have to
run 220volt to the garage though
