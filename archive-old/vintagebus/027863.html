peoples...

George has a valid tip... going to a shop, and having a mechanic impact the
gland nut off for you... this is what I had to do for my first vw rebuild way
back when... I gave the mechanic a few bucks toward the refreshment fund ;)
check out:
http://vw.i405_dot_com/sm.asp?path=\vintagebus_at_type2\Y1999\August\7882
for some good info on impact wrenches and gland nuts...
    I wouldn't feel bad at all about using an impact wrench to remove the gland
nut... but then again I don't reuse impact-torqued gland nuts. Since I bought a
torque-meister, I don't even use an impact wrench to remove gland nuts.
    If you plan to go to a truck shop or the like... that's fine. Most basic
truck shops won't have the 36 mm socket that you need, though... a 1 7/16&quot;
socket is a little loose, but it'll work (providing again that the nut isn't
used again.... I dislike reusing galled hardware...)...

&gt; Either that, or invest in higher quality tools and a long piece of angle
&gt; iron to hold the flywheel.  Worked for me!
