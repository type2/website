Yes, well, Hallo!

As of last night, all of my electrical problems are solved.  The flasher
thing was solved by looking in the type2_dot_com library, checking out the info,
studying the schematics, and then going out there, wiggling wires and
hitting the box with a stick.  Everything works!

Clara Williams stayed the night last night, (remembeer, this '66 Westy I'm
working on is named Clara because of its history) and upon perusal of my
hookups, since I asked her about the fact that my side interior lights had
no juice....when she told me that they got their power from a wire in the
engine compartment, a big light bulb flashed on over my head...it was a
dimbulb, to be sure, but I immediately and joyously began to disconnect the
fuel gauge sender wire from the silly place I had it:  the starter?!? and
put that onto where it goes (it works now....amazing), and then to take the
wire which comes from the left side of the engine compartment that I had
connected to the fuel gauge sender, and connect it to the positive terminal
on the battery.  WOW!  I now have juice to my side lights!  Thanks, Clara!

It just goes to show that when you hook things up like they're supposed to
be, they work!

And then we listened to the engine....Clara agreed that it sounded funny,
and that  it was coming from the left side more than the right.  &quot;It&quot; was a
heavy tapping sound.....I started thinking about the fact that the #3
exhaust valve adjuster nut was a little weird, and that I had put one of
those really thin wavy washers in there to move it to a spot that wasn't
stripped.  Well, Clara agreed that it would behoove us to check it out, and
upon pulling the adjuster, found that it was bent!  How!?!

Checked pushrod, and Clara gave me another adjuster, and I'll bet that after
installing it and adjusting the valves, the engine will be a whole lot
quieter!

Now it's pancake time....

Later!

Gene

&gt; Happy Eostre, Volks!
&gt;
&gt; I have two problems so far ('66 Westy) that I haven't been able to figger
&gt; out.  The re-assembly is almost complete!
&gt;
&gt; *My turn signals ALL work, but only my front hazards function.  How is
that
&gt; possible? Aren't they on the same line?
&gt;
&gt; *My gas gauge was pegging when I turned on the lights, but would go dead
&gt; when I turned the ignition on.  I messed with the fuses, and now it does
&gt; nothing.  FWIW, there is a baywindow tank and sender back there, and I
only
&gt; have 5 gallons.
&gt;
&gt; So far, all my problems have been grounding related.  One by one, they go
&gt; away as I clean off the paint and apply a thin coat of anti-seize.
