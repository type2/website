Subject: Bus won't idle.

Ok, My bus starts after you give it a shot of gas, runs for a minute or so,
then dies.You can keep it alive by goosing the gas pedal, but that is a tricky
manuver going down a hill with a stop light at the bottom.  I forget where the
idle adjustment is on the type 1 1600DP (74 bug)  Is this the problem?  any
ideas?  Also, the &quot;hot start&quot; issue that plagues these older busses, does the
engine turn over but not catch? or is there no juice to turn the starter?
just curious.

Thanks-

-Tom Purdum
