 This weekend I'm headed to Topeka to Rick Taylor's bus farm and in trying to
 keep my bus warm, I hacked together a little something that might work.
 Since I can't adjust the thermostat due to the Berg sump being in the way,
= = =  =
ditch the extra sump.  You have to heat up extra oil. 
-----------
 I
 took 2 sheets of wood backed bathroom paneling and drilled 8 holes in each
 piece.  Each piece measures 12 inches by 13.5 inches.  I put some single
 sticky sided foam tape around the edge of the paneling and wire tied each of
 these covers over my air vents on either side of the bus in effect sealing
 them off.  I still have that louvered decklid on the back
=  === 
ditch that decklid, put on a regular one
------------
 and am missing the
 bottom seal so I still have some air flow back there.
==========
install the seal.  get the engine compartment properly pressurised.
--------------
Now I can watch my
 oil temps and if they start to climb into critical, I can always take the
 side cutters, remove one of my panels and increase the airflow to the
 engine.
 
 I'll let you all know how it works.  So far, the trip home from work didn't
 register anything majorly different however, I noticed a little more oil
 leakage, presumably due to the increased vaccuum created in the engine
 compartment now.
 
 NQ &gt;&gt;
= =  ==
ya- blocking the air vents will make the engine run warmer,  But get the 
other stuff sorted out.  You are also blocking off air for the carb and also 
for the fan which blows air to heat the inside of the bus.  Just MOPBO.
