Subject: New Splitty Hitch

I know some of you have expressed an interest in a hitch for pre '68 busses.
I'll throw out a new design for you're inspection.  I've spent most of the
summer perfecting a hitch that has these features:

Does not have to be removed to change oil.
Adjusting valves is not a problem
Should work with header exhaust system (I haven't tried yet)
Replaces flimsy bumper brackets.
Is &quot;hidden&quot; behind bumper.
Gives the rear of the bus an extra measure of crash protection.
Strengths the rear frame.
Has slot for corner gravel guards.
Uses a 2&quot; reciever style mount.
Bike racks, or cooler mounts can be used in the reciever.
Requires no holes to be drilled, totally bolt on.

And the feature I am most proud of, a special bracing system that takes all
the tongue and pulling forces off the frame and puts them onto the torsion.
This feature will put a &quot;pre load&quot; on the rear frame taking all weight off
the frame.  This is such a different idea that I am putting a patent pending
on this feature.

I will have a couple of these hitches at RMMW, which I will be leaving for
as soon as I send this.  If you would like to see one of these, look for the
yellow westy pulling the white Scamp.  I think both of these are spoken for,
but I may be making more in the future.

I'm sorry I don't have any pictures yet, you'll need to see the hitches in
person for now.
