&gt;Anyone ever have any experience with oil slinging past the oil slinger
washer, hitting the pulley and making a nice mess of the motor?  This is a
sudden development on a normally reliable 1600 dp with about 11K on it.  Any
ideas how to fix?


Look for a blockage in the breather system (the hose connecting the oil
filler to the air cleaner). If this is plugged, the crankcase pressure will
force oil out past the slinger and make a lovely mess all over the engine
compartment.
