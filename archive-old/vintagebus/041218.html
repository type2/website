Thanks for all the responses about the wiring harness. I have another minor
dilemma: while redoing our bus, we're wondering if we should keep our bus a
walk-thru, or make it a non-walk thru? I like the idea of keeping it a
walk-thru, since that's what it is now. However, I also like a
bigger/comfier bench seat... anyone wanna donate &quot;pros or cons&quot; to either?
Thanks,
JRuck
