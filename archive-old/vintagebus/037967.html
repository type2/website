The best advise for putting together a Westy interior is patience, patience, 
patience.
Actually that goes for putting together anything....
Anyways, It took me awhile but I found everything I needed for my SO-42.  I 
found a correct icebox at a Vallejo show, an interior light at another 
Vallejo show, a spice rack in Auburn, jalousie windows in Berkeley and so on 
and so forth.
You have already started publicizing you quest, the leads you pick up might 
help a lot.
 Keep you eyes open at the swap meet, talk to the swappers, they might have 
more stuff at home.
I don't know if you want a Westy wood slat rack, but the metal ones are 
cheaper and more durable (not as cool looking though)
Hope this helps some
