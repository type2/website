Subject: Suburban Design Core at Buses of the Corn

Hi Volks,

Suburban Design Core is proudly sponsoring BoTC2004. As part of our
&quot;arrangement&quot; they are doing a couple of new things.

SDC ScreenShop:
Rather than planning an event, ordering shirts, and praying that
you've made enough/ or worrying that you've made to many, SDC is bring
the shirts to you. We will be screening the shirts on-site, on a per
request basis. This puts less pressure on the organizer (Greg). Greg
is handling the orders and prices. All profits from the
screening/shirts will go to BoTC so that we can have a great event.

and

Suburban Design Core is proud to present Rob Johnston, Tattoo artist.
Rob is a mobile tattoo artist, who will be bringing his gear and doing
tattoo's onsite. This ain't no henna party honey, this is the real deal.
Rob has been tattoing for over 10 years, and is pretty darn good. He
will have all his gear on hand, and books to help you make that
difficult decision. I personally suggest making a decision before
hand, and emailing an image to anarraway_at_mgrp_dot_com. That
way SDC can have all the necessary needles and colours on hand.
Call it the &quot;tupperware party of the next generation&quot;: Rob also does in
home tattooing and &quot;tattoo parties&quot;.

So pack your bags, grab some EMLA, and we'll see you in 2 weeks!

For more information about Suburban Design Core please contact 
anarraway_at_mgrp_dot_com.

Happy trails,

Greg Potts
