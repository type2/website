Hi Bad Camberg freaks all over the world.

Our friend Pim Van Loon made it fast! He sended me the English link for the
Camberg website last night already... so far all of You focussing major
problems with the Deutsche sprache (German language) plse use

Just recieved this info today, I am still looking for someone who would like
to share a room. I am making my room reservations this week. The cheapest
airfare I have found from LA or Phoenix is $974.00 r/t, if anybody finds a
cheaper fare from either of these airports please let me know, even Las
Vegas would work

Furtheron for people who want to see or drive the VW's as well, there will
be a hughe catering on Thursday night at BBT HQ and a Eggs and Bacon
breakfast before the Vintage VW convoy leaves on the Friday morning... all
and everything hosted by BBT....several groups of people from the UK,
Holland and France already signed up.... so the convoy will be quiet
something! At least 7 BBT cars will join together with at least three BBT
recovery cars, fully recovery eqiupment, power group, lights, tent and spare
parts! Lets attend the best Vintage VW show on earth attend in style!!! Free
convoy memory plaque for every participating car....
