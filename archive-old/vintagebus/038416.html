Subject: Pllea for fuel line connect/disconnect hose solution

This is a plea to see if someone can help me come up with a solution...
Someone who knows hardware bits and can think of an off-the-shelf part.

We all talk about clamping the fuel line and plugging the rubber hose when
we disconnect it.  But i find the whole process of pulling the metal hose
and rubber hose apart rather messy.  Especially with new hose, it is
difficult to get up there and worse -- difficult to put back on after engine
is re-installed.

My thoughts are that we can come up with some sort of locking connector, run
rubber hoses to each side of the connector -- and have a much easier way of
disconnecting the engine from the body.

Some sort of locking twist connector.... for about $5 would seem ideal.  You
know how those in-line single fuses somewhat lock together?  Or how a light
bulb locks into the tail light assembly?  Or how air hoses lock together?
Something like that design, a male and female connector that has suitable
ends for our beloved german fuel hose.

You would think that there is some common device we could come up with that
would fit the standard german fuel hose and allow one to QUICKLY disconnect
and -reconnect.

As it is now, I'm always triple-checking that the rubber hose is really over
the end of the metal hose enough and that the clamp is perfect.
