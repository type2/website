Subject: Re:[VB] Judgement

From: Joseph Clark &lt;jclark_at_supernet_dot_net&gt; 
     
I thought I was a poor man because I had no tall bus. Then I saw a man with
only an F-150.........
---
Do not judge a man until you have driven a mile in his F150

Yea, it is easier for a highroof panel to pass through the eye of a needle
than for an F150 to enter heaven.

Ellis clarifies:
Judgement? Oh yeah you mean... http://www.bartleby_dot_com/108/40/7.html

In the spirit of Christmas, I refrain from posting my Volkswagen altered
version of John 3:16. Some things are best left alone. Let's just say that I
sacrificed my buses for a new baby and cash flow. Nice trade...
Peace,
