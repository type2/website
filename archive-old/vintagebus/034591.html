Hi Chris,
You really should shoot for inexpensive and not cheap.  Cheap is the kind of
upholstery we got for a bug from J. C. Whitney once long ago that had all the
thickness of paper towel material and 6 months later had ripped apart.  The
thicker the upholstery, and the better sewn the longer lasting it is.  This
will make it more expensive though in the short run, but in the long run will
save you money time and fustrastion.
  The main problem with the idea of you getting a type 4 later bus is that
these engines cost about $1,500-2,000 for a rebuild and you seem to be low on
funds.  The good thing is that these engines last easily over 200,000 miles
between rebuilds, two to three times longer lasting than the earlier type 1
engines used in the bus that cost $600.00-1,200.00 to rebuild.  Which means
again you save $ in the long run and have more HP.  Yes, you might be able to
find a good used type 4 engine, but unless you personally know and can really
trust the fella selling it you will be buying a pig in the poke.  You should
probably right now fix the 1964 bus you have now.  Get at least $600.00 banked
away for that rainy day you have to have the engine or tranny rebuilt.  Then
think about getting another VW.  Eric &amp; Barb
