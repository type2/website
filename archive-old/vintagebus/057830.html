Subject: Re: 2.1L on 1600 case engine/carb ?

I would think the 44's would be a bit big for what you are considering.
It really depends on your cam, valve size and exhaust size. For a bus I
would think you would want to err on the side of under carbeurated
instead of over. Remember even if you go the big valve big carb, wild
cam route you will need to get rid of or run big fat heat exchangers to
get the full advantage. The engine is basically an air pump and if it
doesn't flow better all the way through having one part big and fat
doesn't really help. I have run dual carbs for a long time now and have
had more problems setting up and dialing in stock carbs than the duals.
I would think a set of 40 IDF's or even the 36mm Dells would be a good
choice. For ease of setup the Kadrons are nice but I really don't like
the looks or the linkage. I am running dual 40 IDF's on both of my
1776's right now and am pretty happy. You are going to want to keep the
compression low in order to keep that cool enough in a bus. I finally
pulled my 2110 out of my bus just because I got tired of staring at the
oil temp guage and worrying all the time. The power was awesome though.
hope some of this helps,
