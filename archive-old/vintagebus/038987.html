&gt; &gt; Can any tell me the part number for the &quot;black box&quot; emergency flasher
&gt; &gt; relay for a 67 bus?  I am converting my 65 to 12V and need a 12V flasher
&gt; &gt; relay and emergency relay.  Anyone have a source for these?

I think the wiring for the turn signal lever control &amp; lights is
a lot different on a '67; not sure if you can use the same switch and
just swap wires around.  My '67 has the stock &quot;box&quot;, though it's bright
blue.  It has 9 connections on top, as detailed in the wiring diagrams
on www.type2_dot_com.  Make sure you're comparing to the USA-spec wiring
diagram.

Ronnie at www.type2parts_dot_com has a replacement relay and can probably
tell you more..
