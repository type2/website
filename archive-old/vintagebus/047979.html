&lt;&lt; &gt; On some engines, the tin under the right cylinders is one piece, which
 &gt; means that thermostat replacement probably involves bending the tin.
 &gt; I replace these with 2-piece tin at the first opportunity.

 &gt; When viewing the thermostat, you're kneeling behind the rear bumper,
 &gt; looking just under the muffler and just over the rear edge of the tin
 &gt; under the right-side cylinders. A flashlight is helpful!

I have seen/ used the kind of  under tin that is one piece on the thermostat 
side.  It has a hole in it for access to the bolt holding the thermostat to 
its bracket.   I have installed/ removed the actual thermostat sproingy bit 
on a motor with this kind of tin- you just reach in from the muffler side 
once the bolt is out, unscrew it from the vertical rod, and remove it.   it 
is a little awkward to adjust it via the bracket though.  i prefer the two 
piece tin.
