I don't think my carb is getting gas from the fuel pump. I took off the air
cleaner, looked down into the throat, worked the linkage, and it seems as
though I'm getting nothing. I have set the timing (I think), put plugs,
points, condenser, and it still doesn't start. Before I changed the timing
and it would start, someone suggested it may have been a vaccuum leak, as
when I started it it would rev up high for a second and then go back down,
no matter what I did witht he accelerator pedal. Taking the carb off is
going to be a tough one, the back two bolts are hidden behind the linkage on
one side and part of the choke on the other, should be interresting seeing
how to get them off. Should the carb be taken off and rebuilt, or is
something just loose, needing to be tightened? Thanks for any help.

you do have gas in the tank?   Take the fuel line that goes from tank to pump
off.   It should immediately start dripping (pouring gas) .  okay put it back
on the pump.    Take the line off the carb and turn the motor over by hand-
it should pump gas out the line.    If not,  try turning the starter a couple
seconds and you should have gas in the engine compartment.  f not-  blame the
fuel pump.   A new one is what 20 bucks or so.

Gas to carb?  okay   Pull the carb if you feel like it.  rebuilding is eay,
you just gotta get the crud out of it and out of all the passages  and make
sure the accelerator pump is working etc.   the two nuts can be hard to get
to, I have a thinner 13mm wrench I use for the forward (nearer the fan
housing) one, and usually pull the cap off the dist. to do that.  Pull the
arm down and gas should spray out the throat.   THat means the accelerator
pump is working.     hope this makes sense.    If there isn't any gas in the
carb and it was going to it either the inlet valve is fubar or there is
something wrong with the float.    you had previously made sure it got a
spark, right, so this is not chasing down the wrong street?
