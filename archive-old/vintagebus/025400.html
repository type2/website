Hi everybody,
I did a compression test for the first time today, since the
local shop wanted twice as much as the cost of the tester tool I
bought.
I really don't know what to make of the results though:
#1 - 130
#2 - 135
#3 - 120
#4 - 132

I don't know if it matters, but the tester screws in, and the
motor turned over about 5-6 times for each test.  I'm hoping
somebody can point me in the right direction.  I didn't search
the archives 'cause I'm really really bad at it (I couldn't even
find the messages about me and my trip) please don't flame me :-)

Bus loads of love,
Diana
