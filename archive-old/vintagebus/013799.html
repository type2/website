I got into the habit of using dry ice usually along with some regular ice, as
i like to throw some cubes in my drinks.

I use an old sneaker box usually(you know the one that your sneakers came in
when they were new). I bring it to the dryice guy, and ask him to fill it.
Then a few zip-locs with ice when starting from home, but when on the road, i
just get some bags of ice, and place them in there too. I am sure there are
ways to superinsulate the dang thing to get the ice to last forever...but i
don't bother.

I have had about 15 pounds of dry ice last for 4-5 days in the beginning of
the summer.
