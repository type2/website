  Heres the deal, on the '62 my wiper blades dont go
 high enough for me. When drivin in the rain w/ the
 wipers on, I have to duck way down to get where I can
 see. (have to duck a little anyways, Im 6'3&quot;)

I know that it's not original but last spring someone suggested using
blades for an older Jeep on my bus. $5 and the only change I had to make
was to remove a very small amount of material at the end of my wiper
arms. The old blades still fit so if I want to go back no problem. In
the mean time I have blades that lay flat on the glass and clean them
well. I can't remember exactly what size. Just ask the folks at your
FLAPS if you can test fit for size.
