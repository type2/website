Hey Y'all!

The Ark lives again!!  It was indeed the fuel pump that laid us low.
Seems there's a different push rod for Alternator type fuel pumps.  I
put an Alternator pump on since she's got an alternator.  (thought
the new pump was bolting on funny).  The difference between the 2 
seems that the lever on the pump sits lower in the base, requiring a
shorter pushrod.

Redid the trial ride that she failed on Thursday.  She's SWEEEEET!
I'm still grinning, though it'll take some getting used to being
down on power.  Even my '64 BMW motorcycle makes better acceleration
but the reality is that ain't what a bus is about.

Thank you all for your encouragement and help when I was stuck.
I'll have to resign from the list Tuesday, as the movers are
gonna pack my box into a box and I'll be computerless for a month.
I'll have to scribe the trip the old fashioned way, then put it
up on a web site once I get online in Miami.  Any listees in the
Miami area?  p-mail me and I'll let you know when I arrive and
maybe we can compare rides.
 
If you see a Blue/White '67 with an iguana looking out the rear
window, it's us.  Wave, say howdy.  I ask that you use all your
fingers when you wave though....  We'll be camping so if you
see us, stop by.

Dave
