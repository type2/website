&gt; Are there 1.2 W 12 V bulbs?  When I took mine apart it had 2 W 12 V
&gt; bulbs and the gels all had holes melted in them.  That extra 0.8 W
&gt; must make a difference.

There are 1.2 W 12 V lamps, but I'm not sure if they have the right
bases to fit the holders in a splitty.  Take a look at
http://www.type2_dot_com/library/electris/bulbs.html .  All of the 6 V
cars take a &quot;N 17 722 1&quot; lamp for the instruments, which is a &quot;J&quot;
lamp, 6 V, 1.2 W.  Some of the 12 V cars take what is nominally the
12 V version of this lamp &quot;N 17 722 2&quot;, which is still a J base, but
has grown to 2 W.  The Ghia, bay Bus, and Type 4 take a different
lamp &quot;N 17 751 2&quot; which is 12 V 1.2 W, but is a &quot;JG&quot; lamp.

I suspect the &quot;J&quot; lamp is the bayonet kind with a round brass base
with two ribs on it, while the &quot;JG&quot; base is the flat pressed glass
base with wire leads folded up on it.

Looking in a Wagner Lighting catalog, they have a part number 11009
for a lamp with a BA7s base (round metal with two ribs) that is rated
at 14.40 V, 1.73 W.  It's not 1.2 W but it's a little less than 2.0 W.
