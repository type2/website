 Hey y'all
 I thing I've got a bad sending unit.  When the bus is still not fully warmed 
 up and I take a fairl sharp right hand bend in a 'spirited manner', my oil 
 pressure gauge and light come on.  Of course I shut down immediately and go 
 out back to check.  Plenty of oil in the sump, sending unit wires are there. 
   I'm running a dual output sending unit (light and gauge).  Any thoughts?

what does the guage read when the oil light comes on?

what is the date on the sending unit?

I run one of those dual VDO senders in my 65 westy, and if anything the oil 
pressure is high on cold mornings.    but when I was in Arizona the light 
kept coming on and the guage reading low.   Turned out the sender I had was 
dated 1978.  It was bad- tested oil pressure with another guage.  Bought a 
new sender (warrantied for 3 years) and the oil light does not come on.   The 
guage reads differently.   Just a thought.
