Subject: Rear bearing removal? 63 SC
Message-ID: &lt;37F645FC.4E4CF6C9_at_fullnet_dot_net&gt;

Started pulling the redux boxes apart to find the source of one stub axle
being ~1/2 inch longer than the other. 

Found that the right side stub axle has 9/64 inch end play, enough to let the
bearing come free of the housing.

What is the best method to pull these outer bearings? Bentley shows a puller
(VW 241) that reaches inside the ball bearing. I was planing to make one out
of all-thread but the bearing cage doesn't allow enough space to insert
anything. Is there a simple way to do this?

Note: Both outer bearings are FAG #6306.C3 but are different, using different
cages.
