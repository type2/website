Subject: front window curtain hooks

Does anyone have a source for something that work as the curtain
hangers in my 66? The only hint I found in the archives was a
reference to some bathroom hangers available at walmart. I looked at
all the local retail places and never found anything that worked. My
backup plan is simply to use magnets, but I'd love to use something
that actually slides in the tracks.
