Subject: Re: [VB] Bus stereo question...

----- Original Message ----- 
&gt; I have a 15 year old or so AM/FM/cassette stereo in the dash of my '67
Westy
&gt; (I'm guessing about 10 watts per side?).  It runs through an equally old
Radio
&gt; Shack brand 40 watt equalizer/power amp and out to 4 fairly unremarkable
car
&gt; stereo speakers (two in the front doors and two in the rear of the Bus).
&gt; Sounds great when I don't crank it up to high, but as I increase the
volume
&gt; toward loud, the volume occasionally pulses or drops temporarily.  The
louder
&gt; you go the more frequent the &quot;drop-out&quot; of volume.  I assumed it was maybe
&gt; drawing too much power at that point.  Does that simple description sound
&gt; right/familiar to you audio experts?  If so, could you comment on a
solution
&gt; (those &quot;caps&quot;, etc.) in plain English for us audio rookies?  You know,
what
&gt; they are, what they do, where to get 'em, how to install them properly,
how to
&gt; obtain a wiring diagram of how they should be installed, etc.?  Us
&quot;rookies'
&gt; would sure appreciate your guidance!
&gt;

A &quot;Cap&quot; is just short for capacitor.They are like a power reserve, able to
charge very fast, and discharge very fast. They are pretty overkill unless
you have a pretty large system. My current bus, i'm running 100 watts to
some speakers, and i'm far from needing to add a cap to the system. It
helped a lot when I was running 610 watt's with my old system about 7-8
years ago with a 12&quot; sub taking 360 watts. (oh the things I thought were
cool when I was younger.....)

If your headlights dim to the beat of the music (not counting when you're at
idle), a cap will help. They are pricy, so don't buy one unless you know for
sure if you need one or not. Unless they've come down in price, it's been
almost a decade since I bought my last one.
