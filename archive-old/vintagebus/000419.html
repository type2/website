&lt;&lt; Got a question for all of you with the early style front sliding glass 
windows, the ones without holes for the latch.  Pre '60?  Anyway, as you know 
the felt track is different from the later style with the latch thru the 
glass.  As far as I know noone repops the earlier style felt.&gt;&gt;
Hi Robert,
We hear your pain, and since we are in the same boat, and know what you are 
going through.  This style of window side glass was used from about 
1957-62ish  Our 1962 westie has this same Sigla laminated glass for the 
slider, and wing windows.  Due to this being laminate glass these pieces 
break very easily compared to tempered glass.  We have heard rumors that USA 
lawmakers had an idea that if laminate glass was good for the windshields it 
would be great for side windows.  The other drawback of laminate glass is 
that if water is allowed to get to the edges it attacks the plastic laminate 
between the two panes of glass causing it to bubble around the edges.
 
&lt;&lt; The easy solution is to replace my sliding windows with the holes in the 
glass.  But, like so many of you, I don't want to take the easy route and 
would rather drive myself crazy trying to stay &quot;stock&quot;.&gt;&gt;
Right, we are looking for the glass sliders, and hoping for the wing window 
glass for ours to replace all the cracked, and bubbled windows.  Fortunitly 
we were able to find one pair of NOS felt channels.  We have been wondering 
if it would be possible to recover/glue the old channels with artificial felt 
to refurbish them.
 
&lt;&lt;I've heard that one way is to buy two felt kits and cut them up and somehow 
*splice* halves togehter to make one good set out of two.  Tedious but maybe 
the only solution. &gt;&gt;
Not at all sure that would work.  The bottom channel for the slider has to be 
wider to accommodate the steel frame around the base of the slider glass.  
How to widen this to do this......          Eric&amp;Barb
