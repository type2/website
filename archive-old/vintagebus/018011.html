Subject: Got a new small stash
Mime-Version: 1.0

I'm in Abilene for work and visited with a bus friend here who is gonna be
moving soon. I ended up buying a '59 Kombi from him with a bunch of parts
inside it.

The Kombi is missing one cargo door, the engine lid, apron, and engine. It
originally came with Safari windows, but those are gone as well. No
interior. Tailights and bullets are gone. It's basically a parts bus that I
think could be saved. I've got a soft spot in my heart for '59 era busses!

I also got a bay window middle seat, a split bus middle seat, a couple sets
of bumpers, a couple sets of 15&quot; wheels, and a bunch of other parts that
I'll have to go through when I get it home.

I might sell or trade some of the parts. He unfortunaly took the doors and
stuff that are missing for use on his double cab truck. Oh well. 

He's got rear gate for a truck that's in fair to good condition. It's not
beat up or bowed and it has surface rust. If someone wanted it, I could
pass along his email. I have no idea how much he'd want for it.

Anyway, just wanted to tell someone who wouldn't bitch at me.....'cause I
still havn't told my wife!!!!!
