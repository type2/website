That was too easy, rope has been made out of hemp for centuries, hemp rope
is resistant to mildew and mold, I have some hemp rope here that I have had
since I moved to Havasu 10 years ago and it still is usable. Back in the old
days we use to refer to smoking a joint as smoking the rope and/or roll rope
or do you have any rope.

Ronnie  stopped that stuff 30 years ago

Subject: [VB] Hemp Trivia - Win a Prize


Hey Everyone,

    This whole hemp thing has really stirred up the list.  I'd like to add
to the fun.

    I'm prepared to offer up one of my spinning &quot;Vee Dub Emblem&quot; sprinklers
(a $60 value) as a prize to the first person who can correctly answer the
following Hemp trivia question:

&quot;In today's modern &quot;Zero Tolerance&quot; policy U.S. military, where in naval
shipboard aviation, is hemp used daily and why is it used there??&quot;

    First person to e-mail me the correct answer is the winner.  I'll post
the answer tomorrow evening _at_ 6:00pm PST if no one gets it as well as the
winner if someone does.

Good Luck!!
