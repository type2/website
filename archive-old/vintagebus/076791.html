Subject: Re: [VB] Weatherstrip problems

Don't they (bus depot, etc) still have teh German rear hatch seal... I 
believe it is pricey, molded rubber and all that, but is supposed to work right.

Can anyone recommend the best source for weatherstrip/seal for the rear door
on my 70 bus. I've had problems with poorly fitting  weatherstrip in the
past.

Thanks,
Phil
