Hi,

Sited a bus just east of freeway 580. Visible from the freeway. The
exact location is just south of Patterson Pass Road and the aquaduct.
If traveling north, there is some sort of industrial building with a
small passel of junk cars. The Bus may have a tow bar attached to the
front. It is quite visible from all North bound lanes. Heading south,
travel past Patterson Pass Road, past the aquaduct, then look to the
left. Looking from the left lane, the upper half of the bus is visible
from the driver seat of an american 4 door sedan. Maybe someone can
investigate further. This bus has been there a while, I saw it earlier
in the year and again this weekend.

The body looked complete from my distant vantage point.

Chris.
