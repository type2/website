Hey Volks

This was posted on the UK Split-Screen Van Club forum this weekend:

&gt;a classic car auction was held in southend
&gt;on 11th march and a '53 vw camper was
&gt;on the list but had no price guide or condition
&gt;but there is'nt many of these babies about ..
&gt;the only one that i found was on Rich Stainsby's
&gt;site, is this the same one or is there another
&gt;anyway this weeks Classic Car Mart printed
&gt;the results of the auction and says that it is
&gt;a condition 3 car and was sold for £375 to
&gt;a very lucky if somewhat brave buyer
&gt;anyone knows.

Sounds like someone got lucky.
