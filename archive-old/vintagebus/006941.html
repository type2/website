Kind of reminds me of the 2 Barndoors I just got, except I had photos but
they really didn't show the extent of the rust, when I phoned the owner I
ASKED if the chassis was still in the Deluxe and solid, I was told YES, upon
loading on the trailer it fell completely out! duh
But the panel was pretty much as described, actually better then I
anticipated.

Ronnie

good luck on your find

Sunroof? I never even asked if it has air in the tires. Mind you these are
original!!!!! tires. Good thing I called the guy again yesterday. I'm gonna
have to take the usual then with me. A set of mounted rims for starters.
Now, I'm just keeping my fingers crossed as I don't really know how well
this guy was able to describe it. I mean from sitting for over 20 some years
in some barn it could be all gone underneath. He mentioned something about
mice and stuff but well, nothing scares me.

Have to wait and see.

&gt; Sounds great!  If you see the bus and decide that it's not quite what you
&gt; wanted, you can just drop it off at my house :-)
&gt;
&gt; 1600 miles!!!!!  I am in awe of the trek you're about to make for this
bus.
&gt; I've passed on several VWs less than a hundred miles away just because I
&gt; didn't want to transport one that far, and you don't even know what type
it
&gt; is!  That is so cool!  You did ask if the bus has a sunroof didn't you?
&gt;
&gt; See you soon,
&gt; Matt Montgomery
