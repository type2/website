Hey y'all
Just to get you up to date.  Wednesday I built a new table to replace
the
de laminated plywood table.  Came out good for a &lt;very&gt; amateur
woodworker.  I'll laminate it this coming week when I get tired of
wrenching,

Thursday I installed the brake lines fore and aft.  Doesn't;  sound like

much but tell ya what they were encrusted with that good old Georgia
dirt.  Cleaning took quite a while.  I got them done, kissed the local
parts lady's butt over the phone in hope that she'll get the parts I'm
waiting for.  I got that done, came in to warm up then Chet came over to

trade rear seats.  I had a Z-bed in the Tinkertoy and Chet had a correct

middle seat.  We traded and I welded a patch into his floor.  Friday I
had to work so that was shot.

Saturday I met with some of the Full Moon Bus Club for scottish
breakfast
(mcdonalds) and we picked up an engine that had parts Royce and Snoopy
need.  I went home, picked up the case, rods, and crank and went to the
local guru to get a confirmation that the markings on the crankshaft box

were indeed true.  They were.  I bought bearings from Doc Woosley and
came home to take a nap, having been up and about since 4am Friday.
After dinner I thought it was time Sherry (my wife) got started on
assembling the engine.  I figure if she does most of the work she'll be
more inclined to love the bus.  That's the plan anyhow.  I scrubadub
dubbed the crank, sprayed copious amounts of WD40 through the passages
to
flush what I loosened up scrubbing.   The crank gears were heating in
the
oven and when they reached a balmy 450 degrees Sherry installed the #3
bearing and tried to install the camshaft drive gear.  Got it most of
the
way before the gear &quot;stuck&quot;.  Oh well tomorrow I'll press it on the rest

of the way along with the remainder of the crankshaft nose stuff.  After

that it's time to install the rods, finish crankcase tasks, and be ready

to finish off the short block.  Ahhhh

I'd rather be poor and unknown.  If I were rich the gummint
would take the rest of my money.  If I was famous, everybody'd
be digging in my business.  You don't even know my dog's name.
