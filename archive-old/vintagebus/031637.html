The worse part of putting the plastic filter between the pump and carb is
that when it cracks it's going to pump fuel all over your pretty triangle
piece.
I have mine before the pump on all my VW's (I can't say buses anymore being
I also have a couple beetles now)

 I would recommend removing the fuel filter from the pressure side of the
 fuel pump, that is bad news.
 
 Actually, remove the plastic fuel filter from the engine compartment 
entirely,
 I put mine right under the fuel tank outlet, under the Bus.
 
 Anybody want to 2nd me?

I put the filter between pump and carb, but have a longer piece of line to 
loop around the coil.   So far, no problems.
 I dont like a filter when it is not easy to see, or where it will pour gas 
on me when I chnange it.
