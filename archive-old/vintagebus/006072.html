&gt; I agree with Neil though, just find yourself a nice 64-67 roof and use it.
&gt; or just tel your friend to go buy a deluxe and not be a poser  ;-)

&quot;_Just_ find a 64-67 roof&quot;?  How many 21 window roof clips do you guys see
for sale a year?  I can think of 2 in the last 3 yrs and I'm sitting in
sunny CA.  As far as the rear hatch question, someone had suggested (on the
list) &quot;grafting&quot; the skylights and sunroof into the existing roof rather
than replacing the whole thing.  The last 23 window I saw for sale that was
running was $10g's.  The last 23 window I saw that was not running and rusty
went for $5g's.  &quot;just go buy a deluxe&quot;? ;o)
