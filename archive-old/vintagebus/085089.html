Subject: Re: [VB] Third brakelight?

Technically, it's not a *third* brake light.  It's the *only* brake
light.

No idea if one from an ambulance of the same year would work though...

I have got this engine hatch without the third brakelight housing but
with the cutout. I was looking for a housing and ran across one for an
ambulance that looks like it would work, but am not sure, any
suggestions?
