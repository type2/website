&lt;&lt; Then there are a million ways to keep them flat...
 por-15 on the back I heard works pretty well, although the majority of 
listees probably use a plastic liner between the panel and the door, making 
sure that the door can drain properly, Eric and Barb probably have some 
solution with tar...good luck.  &gt;&gt;
Hi Kevin,
Definitely use the plastic inside of the door panels and make sure that the 
bottom of the plastic drops into the bottm of the doors.  This way the water 
that drains from both the wing and slider windows is shunted back to the door 
bottoms and drain out the door drain holes.  Without the plastic the water 
drips down the inside of the door panels and drips into the bus and under the 
floor mat.   We do like to coat with tar the inner bottom half of the front 
doors to repel rust formation.    Eric&amp;Barb
