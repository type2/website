Subject: Star light Star Bright...

Star light Star Bright... There goes the 1400th shooting star that I've seen
tonight.
Saturday evening my wife, daughter and I drove the '67 Westy approx 50 miles
south of Phoenix just off I-8 to watch the meteor shower. Arriving after dark
at an astronomy club's gathering is not the place for a poser car owner.
Protocol dictates at all lights are off and late arrivals are guided into the
site via red lens pen lights. =) No case burning and club rules of no alcohol
cut the &quot;rubber johnny&quot; factor to null. We laid out on the blanket watching
tons of shooting stars until we faded at about 3am. Not being the gurus of
stargazing we had enough by then and missed the ultimate final oncore. It seems
a little like passing out in the old days before Clapton played Layla or Skydog
Duane stepped up to the spot light for his specialty. &lt;old school reference&gt; Oh
well! Even two year old Audrey stayed up to 2am. She's usually out at 7:30 pm.
Sunday was a treat as you might guess! ;-P
The trip was a shakedown cruise for recent maintenance to the center pin, link
adjustment and brake adjustment. &lt;thanks again to Kyle Tillman the repair Saint
of the Phoenix bus scene.&gt;
Also replaced the Yokohama 195/7?/14 Y370's that I bought back in 1997. They
were replaced due to scary separating issues, age, wear, inappropriate &lt;lack
of&gt; front end maintenance and Arizona dry rot. I got about 30,000 out of the
tires. I enjoyed the D range side walls and general ride. And tried to stay
with that range. Was soon reminded that searching for D range 14's isn't easy
for the off-the-shelf crowd. My goal was to buy a set of safe tires prior to
our first trip/usage of the bus since Spring. Frankly speaking, finances kept
the bus off the road this summer. I replaced the Yokohamas with a set of 4
27x8.5R14 Pathmax LT tires from Big O. More of an aggressive tread and horsier
typography than usually acceptable but what the heck. More of a bada**ed
roadwarrior look so I switched to gray painted hubcaps like the '67 should have
had all along. Now for the Dormo front rack, Roobars, Shortwave-rolling
hamshack set up, stoneguards for the lights and tons of KC lights! =) &lt;hey now&gt;
PepBoys had a similar tire for same/slightly cheaper price but lacked the
ability to mount/balace the wide five pattern. Time was an issue. Big O won the
deal due to having a set of the Bridgestones and the LT's on hand. My cost was
$373.33 with 3 year no-prorate, no question replacement plus factory warranty.
I passed on a set of the Bridgestone 603 8plys that would have cost $398. out
the door but lacked the longer warranty. The extra $50 for the supposed road
hazard warranty put them out of my reach.

The bus ran great, the combined effect of the repairs and tires allowed the bus
to run great and track nicer than it has in a long time. Now I can shop for a
set of aviation headphones so that all in the bus can converse without
shouting. I forgot how loud the bus was and quiet the Land Cruiser and F150's
are. ;-)
