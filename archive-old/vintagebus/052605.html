Subject: Re: [VB] 67 tipper driving impressions

&gt;I got the tipper out of the shop this morning and putted around town
&gt;to show a few friends.

He's a day tipper, Old Bus driver, yeah... 

&gt;- If you turn on the turn signals, as soon as the flasher unit tries to
&gt;blink the lights, the fuse blows.  The lights all work.

I am assuming you mean that the lights come on as soon as you hit the
switch but when it's time for them to click off the fuse blows.  I
would look first for DPO creativity in the area of the turn signal
flasher.  In particular, the '67 Euro wiring diagram shows a separate
ground wire for the flasher which should go (only) to terminal 31 on
the flasher.  If your flasher doesn't have a terminal 31 (most aftermarket
flashers don't) then unhook the ground wire.

&gt;The emergency flasher doesn't blink the lights also (I think at least).

This bus was originally Euro spec, right?  If so the emergency flasher
switch *may* have been a DPO addition.  If you get the turn signals
working then the emergency flasher may follow.

*IF* this Bus has a 9-prong box you can follow my write-up at
http://www.type2_dot_com/library/electris/vw-9prong.html , but if it's
Euro-spec it wouldn't have had one of these originally.
 
&gt;- To answer Everett's question, it takes 51 pumps to reach the first stage
&gt;and 24 more to get the bed in it's highest position.

I have absolutely no experience in this area but that seems like kind
of a lot.  You might see if there is any provision to bleed or fill the
hydraulic circuit for the tipper.
  
&gt;... oh yea, just how much do you all think I should lower it????

Well, you should always lower the bed back down flat before driving it.
It could play hell with your mileage and handling otherwise.  :)
