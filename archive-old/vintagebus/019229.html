I've owned several VWs but only two splitties...

1967 Kombi, 1967-2001 RIP -- This bus has been retired as of last week since I
will need a lot of parts from it for the Westy.  I drove this thing everywhere,
all across the eastern bit of the US, moved myself to college in it, etc.  I
put 25000 miles on an engine Dave Easterwood pretty much found in his yard ;-) 
with absolutely no problems I might add.  Except for generators.  The Kombi
liked to eat generators.  Ask anybody who has ever been in a caravan with me...
Frame damage and the aquisition of the next bus made me decide to stop putting
money in it.  Good times though.  And like fifteen degrees of camber baby, real
men take corners on two wheels!  ;-)

1967 Westy, 1967-???? -- Not yet on the road, hopefully I will make Everybus
2K+1 in it.  Pretty complete, with a few options, one of the more unusual being
full subflooring (belly pans).  Still has the child's cot even.  Bought in the
&quot;rought part&quot; of Macon ;-) from crazy carpenter George, sittin' on rims waiting
for someone to move it.  And let me tell you, it didn't want to move.  Three
wheels locked up, dug tracks four inches deep in the dirt pulling it onto the
tow truck.  Happily they all roll now :-)  The amazing DaveE yard special goes
in this bus too after a rebuild!
