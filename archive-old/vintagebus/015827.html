don't know all the details yet but I'm hoping to go look at it 
tommorow afternoon.I do know that it is a 1958,it does have the
correct taillights,roofhatch and complete interior,lost title?,no 
bumpers,RUSTY..
If I do get it I will not be keeping it becouse of my overload of 
projects as it is... so it will be sold!


and a totally unrelated find yesterday of a 1958 kombi..this one will 
be cut up as it is  way too rusty/hacked to save..homemade 
plywood camper top featuring a 4x6' hole cut in the roof!
funny..the guy I got it from told me &quot;its a 1958 microbus with 
sunroof!! I have to say I was slightly disappointed when I first saw 
it...on the good side it was free!! and has many salvagable 
parts...58 only decklid!! non recessed cargo doors,MIDDLE SEAT!!!
(later 61?-67 style with rubber grab handles)...and a few other 
misc. things..since it will be cut up I will save the title and vin 
plates for??

located in bremerton,wa
