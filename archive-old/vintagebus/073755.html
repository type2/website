&gt; Have I overlooked anything? Suggestions?

I had a rocker arm stud strip out one time.  Made the same type of
&quot;clack&quot; like I'd not adjusted the valves correctly and one side was WAY
too loose.  After checking them (the valves) a bunch of times I took the
rocker assembly off only to find that upon reinstallation, one of the
studs would not tighten down.  The threads were stripped and so the
shaft was &quot;slapping&quot; against the boss every time that cylinder's valves
were being opened/closed.  JB welded the threads and it solved the
problem. 

Just a thought.
