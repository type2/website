&gt; I don't understand how anything could be damaged by holding a depressed pedal

Have you ever removed your engine and seen where and how the t.o. bearing
operates?



&gt; Am I the only
&gt; one that keeps the car in first, and holds the pedal down?

I certainly hope so, and I certainly hope that you stop doing that. Your
throwout bearing is pressing against the rotating pressure plate with
several hundred pounds of pressure. It's a small fairly humble bearing,
and it doesn't ask much during its life, except not to use it too much.

It's only there to operate the clutch when shifting gears.
