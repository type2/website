Subject: Re: [VB] $500 buses... 

they are still out there, in the past year or so I bought a straight and
very dry 64 kombi complete with cab divider and rear seat  for 400, and a
dry og paint sundial less interior and rear bumper with the motor torn down
and in the back for $275. I was given a 59 kombi that I sold for $100 and a
case of beer, those folks later gave it to someone else. When I moved all my
buses to one yard last summer I sold a 59 single cab(with gates) for $500
and I sold a 57 panel and 59 kombi to a friend for $200 each, he then resold
them for $500 each.
