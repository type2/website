Subject: Re: [VB] 6V starter

Once again Matt, some very compressive useful advice.  Thanks!

&gt; Are you using nice, heavy wires (4 gauge or better) to hook the battery
&gt; to the starter?  Jumper cables are often plenty thick but make crummy
&gt; contact at the clamps on the ends.

Well, these aren't the newest set of cables around.



&gt; 
&gt; It kind of sounds like you're trying to start the engine before you
&gt; install it, but if it's in a car, check the ground strap at the nose
&gt; of the transmission. 

Yes, I'm trying to start this on the ground to make tuning the dual
carbs easier and to detect any leaks.  I like to do this if possible as
it eliminates a re pull if there are problems.



&gt; 
&gt; I guess you're using a piece of a bellhousing to mount the starter in,
&gt; but if you're using a whole transmission, you know it turns freely and
&gt; is out of gear, right?

Yes, I'm using a gutted 6V tranny case/housing.  There are no guts/gears
what so ever.


&gt; 
&gt; It's possible you've got bad contacts in the solenoid.  If you want to
&gt; know for sure, disconnect the battery negative cable, and then bolt the
&gt; positive cable onto the &quot;wrong&quot; stud at the solenoid -

I'll try this.  I'd not thought of that.  Thanks.



&gt; 
&gt; Are you sure that the engine still has a 6 V flywheel on it?  

Yes I'm sure, as this car is a very original (62K) one owner car (T3). 
I don't think the motor had ever been removed before.  Almost every
part/hose/wire is original.  It sat for 25 years.  When I can get the
starter to engage (even though it is briefly, there are no grinding noises)

Thanks again!!

Steve
