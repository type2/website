Subject: Re: Oil plate thread size

&gt;Anyone know what size the 6 studs are that hold the plate cover on the
&gt;bottom of the oil strainer? Some of mine are stripped.

Pretty sure they are 6mm.  Another option is to get a step-stud which
is a stud that is bigger on one end - the one for this application is
6mm and 8mm.  You drill and tap the case for the 8mm end and just screw
it in, leaving a 6mm end sticking down.

If at all possible do the drilling with a variable speed drill on low
speed or even a brace and bit.  The case alloy is very soft and will
&quot;grab&quot; at your drill bit.  My Dad did this on his Bug and wasn't 
ready when the case sucked in the drill bit so quickly...the hole
ended up usable but a little crooked.

Kyle's idea of putting a bolt in from the top also sounds pretty cool.
I wonder if it would be a good idea to put just a touch of Loctite or
maybe RTV on the bolt threads before threading them in, against 
loosening and leaks.
