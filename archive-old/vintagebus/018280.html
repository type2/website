What is the compelling reason for installing the 901 trans?

The porsche trans is physically larger than the VW unit; I don't
know if it would fit height-wise without mods.  I think it would, but
close.  I think it's also longer than the VW unit, so you'd have to
accomodate that.  To use the IRS components, you'd have to
install the trailing arms from the porsche, and either modify the
porsche spring plates to fit the bus, or the bus ones to fit the porsche
bits.

The 901 trans will be more expensive to rebuild when the time comes,
and the clutch parts are more expensive as well, since the carry the magick
P label. 

What engine are you planning on using with this beast?  A 912 engine would,
of course, fit nicely.

There was a guy _at_ kelly park with a 911 engine and trans - don't know if it
was a 911 or 915 - and I don't have any details of the conversion.

Try searching on rennlist_dot_org and see if anyone has posted something there.

The 912 motor has more oomph than the VW unit, so probabaly you'll run into
the same problems that others ran into when installing &quot;freeway flier&quot; 
transmissions into stock-engined buses.  You'll have a 5th gear, but 
I dunno if you'll have the HP to make use of it.

&gt; I wish to install the 901 series transaxle and use the 912 IRS. Has anyone
&gt; done this? (I searched the archives). Any advice, experience?
