Subject: Re: [VB] A lesson in how NOT to handle a car...

&gt;LOL!  You've never seen the *inside* of his house, have you?

Obviously my assumption was wrong.

  So I'll stick to the single-guy excuse for why he burns and turns 
VW's. I guess maybe the messy inside of his house helps to make sure 
he STAYS single, therefore keeping his VW restoration time in check;)

Hey, anybody remember Thom's comment about passing on a date with 2 
girls to work on his bus!

p.s. he actually said it wasn't 2 girls at the same time.....but it's 
more fun to remember it that way!
