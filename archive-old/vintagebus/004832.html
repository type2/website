&gt;Hello all,
&gt;  OK, here's a problem that I bet none of you have to deal with!
&gt;  I am 4'11&quot; tall and have a problem reaching the pedals.  I can either
&gt;sit on the edge of my seat to reach them, or slide the seat up so far
&gt;that the steering wheel crams into my stomach.  Does anyone have any
&gt;suggestions on how to remedy this problem?
&gt;Thanks! (no short jokes please, I've heard them all!)


First, make sure your clutch and brakes are properly adjusted. You shouldn't
need to go to the floor for either of them. Barring that, you can go one of
two ways. Bring the pedals up to you, or take the seat down. The 67
Westfailure has seats in it out of a Porsche 914. They definitely aren't
stock, but they're pretty comfortable. They sit very low, probably 4&quot; lower
than the stock ones. They sit down between the rails for the stock ones. Got
a nice headrest, too. I like them because my head doesn't hit the doorjamb
when entering and exiting. Or, you can have someone make you some nice
chrome billet powdercoated carbon/Kevlar aircraft aluminum pedal blocks. Or
wood. Make them maybe a tad larger than the pedal and however thick you
need, although I wouldn't go over 2&quot;. Curve the backs so they fit nice and
tight, then drill the pedals and through bolt them. Make sure they are very
well mounted and will stay that way. I've had the little barefoot gas pedal
hang up on me enough to know I wouldn't want my brake pedal doing that. If
you extend the gas pedal up, make the thing as light as a feather, you don't
want a pound and a half of 2x4 bouncing around on it. Or, if this all sounds
like to much bother, go to the thrift store and glom onto an authentic 70's
disco outfit for driving. Elephant bells, VW emblem hanging around your
neck, wide belt with a gigantic buckle, and dig this, some nice white patent
leather elevator platform shoes!!! Very stylish these days you know. Retro,
I should think. Stylish and practical, what we all own VW's for anyway,
right? Might even start a new fad, the ropehead/body piercing thing is kinda
 fading. Thank you for calling the fashion hotline.
