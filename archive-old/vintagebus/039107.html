Hiya list! 
	I have a 65 double cab with some throttle cable woes. When I got the
bus, the linkage was made up of a long wood nail with a hole drilled in the
end and the Thr cable fixed to the hole with wire. The nail was put through
the hole in the original linkage arm. Very cheezy and unsafe looking. Seems
the cable was about 3 inches to short. I figured the wrong cable was
installed so I installed a new 65 cable. Same problem. Is this due to the
engine being from a bug? Seems odd if thats the case. Currently I have
welded together a new linkage arm that works ok, but I was wondering if
there was a more stock solution, or at least a reason for the short cable.
The current lingake arm sits on the stock pin under the floor so I dont
think it was moved around. Any ideas?
