Subject: Re: [VB] Back on list w/ a fine(?) vehicle!

Enjoy your new truck!    Especially in a bus sat for ages, it is not wierd 
for it to have a replacement motor installed sometime in the past 37 years.

sounds like the steering box is worn, I'd try readjusting it.

people do sometimes have doubtful taste in upholstery, and trucks do get 
dings in the bed and hidden compartment from things rolling around.

yes- should be 1 key for all locks - including treasure chest locks.   a 65 
w/ steering lock has a dif ig key than door key.   If the ig switch was 
replaced that suggests more than 26K miles.

Trucks (commercials) didn't get vinyl lining on dash.

crack on drivers door hinge also implies more than 26K miles.     But if it 
had lots of short trips maybe not.  I had a 63 DD panels that the drivers 
door and rear hatch and drivers cargo doors were worn, the pass cab door and 
pass cargo doors shut so nice.  You can tell which were used.  about 74K 
original miles.  It was a delivery van for a butcher shop in Everett WA 
(Hausmann's Meats) with large logos.  The cab was almost pristinely stock.  
The only mod a union sticker on the air vents .  (Ya, engine and tranny were 
missing, but oh well)   Ya, rear bumper gone as well I think.

Seems the door thing is a good indicator, usually low milage buses have real 
nice door shutting styles.  But those stay opens do kill the lower hingess 
(every one- lube it to lessen wear and strain)  

Good deal-  I have seen nice SCs FS for 6 to 8 grand.  dunno what they 
actually sell for.  A nice looking, driving truck, decent paint, tidy 
upholstery, minor dings and issues.  Not 100% original (who really keeps 
governors on engines?) but nice. It doesn't seem like you got ripped.   
You'ld be into it more if you got a project and spent the dough fixing it up 
(though you could choose the upholstery.)

&lt;&lt; Hi folks:
 
 I just resubbed due to my latest purchase:
 
 '65 single cab with a claimed 26,000 miles.  Claimed to have been restored
 about ten years back.  Drives nicer than any bus I can remember.  90%
 complete and correct.
 ....
 
 Seller was asking $6500.  Two weeks of on and off negotiations by my buddy
 and myself yielded a $5200 deal.
 
 Opinions please.  How should a 26k bus drive?  Shift?  Steer?  Should I
 believe the mileage?  How about the price?  High?  Low?  About right?
 
 TIA,
 
 Kabayo
