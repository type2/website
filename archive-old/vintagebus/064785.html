&gt; I though the early bus (pre62) Bentley was going to be out in September (Hey! 

They're out.  Ronnie was supposed to have the very first ones _at_ Jerome, and
Ron from Bus Depot had posted a competitive price for them as well.  

&gt; That's now!)  This includes the 53, 55, and 59 edition, so it'd have the 
&gt; 36hp, splitcase, barndoor stuff, right?   They were going to be about $120?  
&gt; what's the story?

This Bentley version was created from original '53 (mine), '55, and '59 manual.
