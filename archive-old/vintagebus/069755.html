&gt;Ya, I've noticed that too over the years, but I haven't seen 
&gt;anything in the books to show that there were different lengths. I 
&gt;mean, after all, the dimensions between the bottom of the fan 
&gt;housing to the thermostat were the same for all 1300-1600 blocks. 
&gt;Eric and Barb say that those dimensions also follow on the 25,36, 
&gt;and 40 hp although I have to take their word for that.
&gt;
&gt;Ray, Kent WA
&gt;Bernoulli Interval: Do I really have enough data to draw a valid conclusion ?


i SWEAR i even found one where the bit that slides into the flaps was 
bent OPPOSITE the way from the others. now i'll have to dig for it.
like i said, tho: a pair of pliers and a determined PO can make a 
lotta strange things!
