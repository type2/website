funny this subject should come up... there is a beam in the center of my 
garage that hangs lower than the door opening and my old pop-top bus used to 
just slide in about 1/2&quot; under this beam. this past weekend i brought the 
newer bus from a friends garage. i had to use a pipe to jack the door up 
another 3 or 4 inches and the rack JUST fits through the door and since its 
on the back of the bus stops before the beam. i was thinking that it wouldnt 
fit in and what a drag it would be to have to take it off and put it back 
on.
