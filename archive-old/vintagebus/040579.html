Subject: Re: [VB] Ebay Reserve


There are different permuations of the reserve discussion:

* some use it in hopes of establishing a value for their goods; basically,
to see how much someone &quot;clicks&quot; that they'll pay.
A lot of people list stuff on ebay with an astronimical reserve that
wouldn't be met due to the limitations of the base 10 numbering system,
and then offer the item to the high bidder when the auction is done.  This
way they still get the traffic, collect the bids, but don't have to
pay commission.

* some folx don't want their reserve known, for whatever reason, possibly
to encourage people to still bid (see point #1)

* some people don't care if the reserve is known, and will list it
in the auction text.

* along the same lines, some people think you should just start the
bidding at what your &quot;reserve&quot; would be.  In a common sense world,
this would work.  but people are more willing to incrementally bid
on an item with a $1 opening bid and a $300 reserve, as opposed to
an item with a $300 starting bid and no reserve.  Go figger. (and
as a math teacher, *you* can do that!)

* some people have been quite sucessful starting the bidding _at_ $1 with
no reserve, but those are usually delectable items and are soon consumed
in a frenzy of bidding, followed by a spate of &quot;spite bidding&quot;

So, there you have it, clear as mud.
