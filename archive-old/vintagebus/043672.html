&gt;I am not sure what the readings with an ohmeter on the guages themselves 
&gt;should be.

It depends on what kind of meters they have inside.  Don't use the Rx1
ohms scale on your meter at first - try something like Rx100 or greater
to start with.  I don't know exactly what it should be but I wouldn't
expect the sender terminal to be shorted (very close to zero ohms)
to either the power or ground terminals.  It may show open (infinite ohms)
to one terminal but I don't think it should be open to both terminals.

The reason not to use Rx1 is that it can let too much current flow
from your meter into the gauge you're testing.  The gauges probably
don't have this problem, but it is possible to burn out other kinds
of meters this way.

&gt;The senders are a vdo oil temp in the oil pressure relief plug dated 
&gt;96 I think, and oil pressure/idiot light double sender in the oil
&gt;pressure area, which was new a year ago.

Are you sure that the engine case is well grounded?  If the starter
and generator work it probably is, but it's a thought.  I had a
really bizarre idea about the case halves being insulated from
each other and one half being grounded and the other not, but I
think there's too much stuff that touches both halves for that
to be true.

Are you getting a nice steady 6 or 12v at the gauges?  If the
generator or regulator is going out, the voltage fluctuation and/or
AC on the system might be confusing the gauges.

You might try taking the gauges to the back of the Bus and hooking up 
short sender, power, and ground wires - run the power and ground ones
right to the battery.  You can't drive it this way but it may tell
you if the problem is in the wires from front to back, the power
supply up front, or what.

Both of the sensors should be resistances that change as the thing
they are measuring changes.  You might try unhooking both sensors
and starting the engine.  Measure the resistance from the pressure
sender terminal to the engine case, and while you're watching your
test meter, hook up the temperature sender wire.  If the reading
on your test meter suddenly jumps, then you probably have grounding
trouble or maybe a problem with the temperature gauge.  If this is
OK, unhook the temperature sender again and measure between it and
the case while you hook up the pressure sender - test meter jumps,
grounding or pressure gauge problems, doesn't jump - senders are
OK and either or both gauges are suspect.

If you want to check the gauges you have to know about what resistances
the sensors have.  Measure the oil pressure and temperature senders
with the engine cold and off, and then idling, to get an idea of
what their resistance values are.  Go to Radio Shack and buy a
variable resistor (pot) to simulate the sender - if the temperature
sender was 100 ohms cold and 300 ohms warm, buy a 1k ohm pot, but if it
was like 100 ohms cold and 1000 ohms warm, buy a 10k ohm pot - like
that.  Make sure it says &quot;linear taper&quot; on the package.  Hook up the
middle terminal on the pot to the sender terminal on the gauge and
ground either (not both) of the outside terminals.  Turn the key on and
turn the shaft on the pot - you should be able to make the gauge
vary linearly over some portion of the range.  If it jumps around
like crazy no matter what you do the gauge is probably bad.  You might
find that it is exponential - turning the pot 10 degrees might make
it go from 0 to 20 PSI and then turning it 10 more degrees might
make it go from 20 to 100 PSI.  This is *probably* OK if there seems
to be a repeatable pattern for it.  To make sure, go get a &quot;log taper&quot;
or &quot;audio taper&quot; pot with the same value and try again - if you can
now make the gauge vary linearly with this pot, then the gauge is
probably OK.

&gt;These guages came out of a bug that burned in a fire.  They weren't very
&gt;old (a couple years?) but I am wondering if/how that would affect things.

If the sender wires were shorted to ground (likely) or power (less likely
but possible) then the gauges could have been damaged.  If you decide
the gauges are a write-off anyway you might try opening them up and
looking for any obviously burned/damaged electrical parts.

Good luck!
