I don't think he is asking if the air cleaner needs the gas heater or how
the air cleaner hangs on the left.  I think this is what he is saying, if
you have a gas heater on the left (drivers) side of the engine compartment,
where do you put the air cleaner?  Good question.


&gt;&lt;&lt; Does anyone have a photo of how an early bus air cleaner works with a
gas
&gt; heater? Right now the Zebra bus' air cleaner is hanging off to the right
&gt; with a coat hanger, but that can't be right. Charlie H once mentioned that
&gt; there is a special bracket for that, but I've never seen it. Anyone have a
&gt; good photo or  &gt;&gt;
&gt;.................
&gt;you dont' need a gas heater for the air cleaner.  Yes the 36hp air cleaners
&gt;don't have the preheat attachment, and so have more carb icing problems.
At
&gt;least you get a manual choke.  If you are worried about the preheat for the
&gt;carb that much you can use a bus 40hp air cleaner, they have the pre heat
&gt;attachement.
&gt;
&gt;The 36hp motors wear the air cleaners on the left.  The tube that goes
across
&gt;to the air cleaner has a tab on it that where the air cleaner is on the
left
&gt;sits above and to the left of the coil.
