I'm currently putting together a 36hp okrasa engine with a Mag
supercharger...   I've taken information from the book 'Making the VW Go'
and they say (at least for the Mag unit) that no real modification should be
made to the compression ratio... except that you should leave it stock.
Then again, I think the Mag is only capable of 3-5lbs of boost.

I'm real interested in others comments as well.!

... out of curiosity, what type of supercharger are you using?

Question 1:
-What initial compression ratio should I run on an engine that will be
supercharged?

Question 2:
- Does anyone have the H.P. Book on supercharging the air cooled VW engine?
What are the fundamental Do's and Dont's from this book? What about a
contact address for the H.P. Book series?

Question 3:
- Has anyone ever run a Spearco brand water injector on an air cooled VW
engine for the purpose of intercooling the compressed air-gasoline mixture?
