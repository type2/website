I just got my bus in August, but looked around for a little while bvefore.  I think you need to determine what you want to do with the bus. I was looking for a peusdo daily driver(I actually ride my bicycle every day, the bus just goes on longer trips with large objects).

I reccomend taking it for a drive, at highway speeds, to see how it handles. Some I looked at felt liked you were playing Pong with the front tires.

Check for Rust! Although my experience with VW's is very limited, I think rust is the umber one culprit, as there are ways to get teh motor running, fix the handling, etc, etc, but Rust is an evil that is difficuly if near impossible to get rid of.

Get under the bus, and look around for rust. Bang the floor boards, look under the floor mats. 

These are some preliminary things to look for, I am sure there are a lot more, for an extensive checklist, I strongly suggest getting John Muir's Idiot Book for VW's. This book has a whole chapter devoted to the pre-purchase inspection.

Good Luck.

(50,000 miles on a '64 sounds a bit tooo good to be true)
