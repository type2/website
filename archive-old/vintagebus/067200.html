&gt;&gt;Call me an optimist but there is one more huge

I'd agree with his &quot;turning heads,&quot; though there aren't many confederate
flags in Illinois, there are plenty of POS DEtroit pickups.

But, the REAL advantage of having no VW shops is that you learn to do it
all yourself.  Tune-ups, valve adjustment, electrical fixes, clutches. 
The list is endless.  I stopped going to tire places too.  Those funny
wheels with the big hole in the middle wouldn't fit anything.  I run
tubes and carry tire irons now.
