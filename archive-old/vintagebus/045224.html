Subject: looking for engine
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

hello
 this is the first post i have done so i hope it makes sense to all

this might be an odd question but where would people suggest i look to find a 
complete 1500 engine. I bought a 65 Double cab not long ago. The only thing 
it did not come with was the engine ;  gear box,reduction boxes ,ect. is all 
there. Ill be restoring this truck back to  original except possibly the 
paint color , therefore id really like to find a complete 1500 rather than 
somhow trying to find the indivdual parts. 
does anyone have somthing such as this for sale ?  im not too concerned if it 
needs to be rebuilt because of mileage , but i dont want somthing that is 
broken from abuse .  If so, please email me 
thank you in advance
Eric
