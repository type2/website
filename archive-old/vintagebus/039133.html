Subject: pressed bumper styles
Date: Thu, 10 Feb 2000 14:35:15 -0800

last night a buddy and i were shooting the sh*t and admiring our type 2s
when i remarked that the front bumpers on our volkswagens are different.
they're both pressed bumpers but the one on his panel has a wider area in
the center between the two raised areas while the bumper on my truck has a
smaller area between the two raised areas.  his panel is a '54 and my truck
is a '56.

in the process of bringing his panel back from the rusty grave, he's
discovered that barndoors are different in practically every respect from
type 2s even just a few years younger.  the logical thought is that the
front bumpers would be different but in what way?  is one of these bumpers a
barndoor bumper?  does the fact that one of the volkswagens is a truck
figure into the equation at all - after all if the rear bumper is
truck-only, why should the front be any different?  we looked through my bus
books but what we saw only seemed to point to my truck wearing a barndoor
bumper and his barndoor wearing a non-barndoor pressed bumper.  (if this is
true it might explain why my truck appeared to be sitting so tall and
proud... on the other hand it could be just the giant tires it wears.)

in hopes of helping you knowledgeable folks out and since i didn't feel like
doing my library work, i created a web page with pictures of the fronts of
our crusty machines:  &lt;a
