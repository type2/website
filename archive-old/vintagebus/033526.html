Our gas has gone down to $1.18 at a few places. Can you believe it!?!?! 
When I went to Cali we paid over $2 a couple of times.

&gt;Hrmmm here in Indianapolis it went up 20 cents per gallon last night,
&gt;alone....

&gt;  today I was pleasently supprised to find that regular gas has dropped to
&gt;$1.50 a gallon, last week it was $1.69 at the same location.
