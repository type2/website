&gt; Short answer: With some help from Matt Roberds and
&gt; Ronnie, Got it all figured out, and drove the bus
&gt; for the first time yesterday evening.  Nice!

Good deal!  Thanks for posting back to the list with
the solution; it helps everybody calibrate their advice
to the next person.

&gt; Now I've got to tackle all of the crazy things I
&gt; discovered once I got it on the road (adjust drag link,
&gt; brakes, accel cable sticks a bit, clutch needs to be a
&gt; bit tighter, aim headlghts).  Does it ever end?

You may have done this already, but: it can end in a
hurry if you don't replace the RUBBER FUEL LINES.  If
your Bus needs all of the above, it probably needs the
fuel lines replaced as well.
