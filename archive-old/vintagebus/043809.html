&gt;What is the best tach to put in a bus and how much would one expect to
&gt;pay?

Hard for me to say.  For price you can spend $30 or so on up.

&gt;Are they hard to hook up?

No, but you will need to run a wire from back to front.  All tachs will
need a connection to the (thin) wire between the distributor and the coil,
and this is the one you have to run up front.  (If you're paranoid, fuse
this long wire to the front at the distributor/coil with a one amp fuse.
If this long one shorts to ground, it can kill your ignition.)

Most tachs also want a ground, which is easy to get up front (body), and 
some want switched battery voltage, which is easy to get up front (ignition
switch).  Some will also have a light bulb which can be wired in with your
dash lights if you want.

Some people like to just temporarily wire in a tach in a new-to-them bus
and drive until they are comfortable with the RPM/speed/tire size/gear
ratios/etc that they have, then take out the tach.

I hope this helps!
