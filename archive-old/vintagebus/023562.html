&lt;&lt; How would someone get rid of trapped sand?  Any suggestions for this or
 otherwise? &gt;&gt;

I'd stay away from sand. The top resto guys don't use it because the heat 
produced causes too much warpage, especially on large bus panels. You'll end 
up spending a lot  more &quot;fill time&quot;ust to get everything straight. Baking 
soda is even worse. It won't do a good job stripping and the stuff you never 
find with a vacuum cleaner has a strange attraction for water! Go to a good 
plastic media guy. The stuff is inert, light, and with the many grades 
available, is suitable for all applications.
