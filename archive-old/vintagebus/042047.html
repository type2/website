&gt; In my 65 daily driver I have been having a problem

&gt; out speedo's.  Only to see marginal results.
&gt; 
&gt; Usually only occures in a.m. commute (i.e. COLD
&gt; weather).  Can last for 5 seconds, 5 minutes or even
&gt; 15 minutes.  Speedo needle remains fairly constant
&gt; (maybe a 2-5 mph flucutation) during the &quot;whining&quot;.
&gt; 
&gt; Any ideas, do I need to/can I lube my speedo???

Yes, although it's not a guaranteed fix.

What I did was to take the speedo out and immerse the protrusion where the
speedo cable attaches in a small cup of heavy oil.  This fix seemed to
work for six months or so.  There is probably a better fix, but I didn't
want to disassemble the speedo.

You might also lube the speedo cable from the top while you are at it.
