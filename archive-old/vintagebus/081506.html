Subject: Fw: [VB] Bus startin' woes

I'm pretty sure that my points and condenser are good - Muir says to clip a 
test light to the wire that goes from the coil to the distributor and to 
pull the centre wire out of the coil and to turn the engine over with a 
wrench etc.. I did all that and as I watched the points open and close the 
light would come on etc... He says that to test the ignition you clip a wire 
between the hot wire on voltage regulator (&quot;the big red one&quot;) and the +15 
wire going to the coil  etc.. and if it starts then the problem is the 
ignition switch - so the hot wire on the ignition switch that he talks about 
... would that be the red and black one that goes to the voltage regulator 
from - I guess the starter - or would that be the big red one that goes 
between the voltage  regulator and the generator - or does it matter?

Again - when I turn the key on and pull the middle wire from the distributor 
and hold it next to a ground and turn the engine - no spark jumps - and when
 I pull a spark plug wire and hold that next to a ground and turn the 
engine - no spark. and coil is brand new.
