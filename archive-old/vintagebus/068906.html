&gt; E&amp;B,
&gt; I am doing this as we discuss.  I got my tranny from Ronnie, what happened 
&gt; was, my son popped the clutch and my 1835 with 1700 pound Kennedy snapped 
&gt; the paddle handle end of the driverside axle right inside the side gear. 
&gt; Dropped about a million tons of cast-iron drivel down into the gear oil by 
&gt; the side bearing.  Hence, new tranny.  Fortunately I have a &quot;donor&quot; bus 
&gt; sitting out in a field about 10 miles away.  It is a rusty, gutted '67 
&gt; Westy I bought several years ago for $400.  I pulled an axle and side gear 
&gt; out of it.  
&gt; 
&gt; I bought new bearings from Ronnie when I got the tranny.  I did'nt think 
&gt; you could pull the RGB gears out and press them in yourself, so I had the 
&gt; local FLAPS with a machine shop do it.  Charged me $60 an hour and it took 
&gt; an hour and a half, each side, so the bill came to $191.25.  Is that 
&gt; reasonable?  They also drilled and re-tapped a threaded hole that had a 
&gt; broken bolt that I was unaware of.  I knew I was missing a bolt when I took 
&gt; off the driver side, but didn't know it was busted inside.  
&gt; 
&gt; The FLAP's machinist also told me that someone had beat the bejunior out of 
&gt; the bearing cap that you have to pull to get the old bearing out and the 
&gt; new in, on the inner part of the RGB.  He said it was rubbing against the 
&gt; extisting bearings on both RGB's.  He had to drill the cap and pull it, 
&gt; then install the gear and finally, he repaired the the two holes in them 
&gt; with an oxy-acetelyne torch, and then siliconed it to make sure it won't 
&gt; leak any gear oil.
&gt; 
&gt; This sounds good to me.  I am wondering what you guys think of all this.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks,

Hi Curt,
Sounds like the repairs are going well for you.  The price per hour for 
repairs does seem a tad high, but it does sounds like they were through.   
Yes, you can replace the RGB bearings yourself with commonly used VW tools, 
though having a few special use tools does make it alot easier.  We got to 
the point with the 1955-63 RGBs that we replaced all of the bearings in one 
of them in less than two hours while at a rest stop just North of Redding in 
less than two hours!  We do wonder if you might need to go to a lesser 
strength clutch which will allow a bit more slippage when the clutch pedal is 
released suddenly and thusly protect the tranny and even engine from the 
sudden shock.  We had a friend who actually snapped the tranny in two pieces 
just forward of the RGB axles due to running a 2 liter type 4 engine and 
letting the clutch out with the engine at high RPM while showing off for some 
friends of his.  Plus it has been shown engines last longer due to less 
shock.  In the autostick bugs the tranny has a hydralic torque converter to 
cushion the shifting.  This results in the well maintained not hot rodded 
engine lasting instead of only 80,000 to 100,000 miles with the standard 
stick shift to quite often 150,000 miles in the autostick bugs/Ghias!
