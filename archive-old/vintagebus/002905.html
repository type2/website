Subject: Re: Front Suspension Stuck

&gt;The biggest problem I have right now is with the front end suspension.
&gt;The bus drives and steers just fine. New shocks. The suspension just
&gt;doesn't move. The drivers side is up against the rubber stop and the
&gt;passenger side is about 3/4 inch off in the compressed direction.
&gt;I have applied a reasonable amount of downward pressure using a jack
&gt;with the wheel suspended.

(Snip)

&gt;Can I take the torsion arms off the springs
&gt;without disassembling the entire front end. I figure that might be a way
&gt;to tell which end of the system is binding.

Yes, you can. Assuming the part that you're taking off isn't the frozen
part. Basically, you take the wheel off, remove the cotter pins and nuts and
bolts retaining the link pins and pull the spindle off of the torsion arms.
Wire it up or set it on a jackstand, resist the urge to dangle it from the
brake hose. The effort won't kill you, but a broken brake hose might! Now
you are presented with the torsion arms. Loosen the lock nut and the allen
grub screw on the torsions. Easy, now just slide them right out. You may
have plastic bushings or roller bearings in the torsion tube. Don't know
offhand which is correct for your vehicle but at that age anything is
possible. If they don't slide right out or turn, you got problems, bub. Is
it compressed all the way? Like lowered? Maybe your torsion bars/springs
collapsed. First, when you look at the hub of the torsion arm where it
connects to the torsion tube, is the center area smooth, or are there some
open spaces? Does grease come out it? If open, some crackpot has yanked
springs and left the hole open for Mr. orange locktite to do his evil work.
And I do so hate shoddy lowering. It's much worse than regular lowering. If
these holes are open and it has allowed the tube to fill with rust and crap,
I would seriously consider not even reassembling the deathtrap and driving
on it. Get another front end from torsion arm to torsion arm and hang your
spindles on it. Leave the shims as they are, hopefully it will work out.
Bent torsion arms or a torsion tube not quite square require reshimming but
that procedure is best left to you, the Bentley, and many beers, or a pro
that will do it for you for many beers. If it is locked in the fully
extended position that is the weirdest thing I've heard all week, was it
stored for 25 years up on jackstands? In the rain? Check it out and let us
know.
