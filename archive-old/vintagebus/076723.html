Subject: Re: [VB] front seat area?

It seems like it would help the bus keep it's shape.  In the rear, you've
got all the sheet metal that separates the engine from the cabin to keep the
shape in the rear.  Up front, you could have the bench seat partition could
help keep the shape in the front (there's still the frames for the
walkthrough sections on a walkthrough bus).  I'm not sure how much this
would affect the bus for daily use, but it might become evident in a wreck.
Don't quote me on any of this, as I've never been told this, it's just what
it seems like to me.

&gt; Is this an old wives tail that has spread to every corner, or is there
some
&gt; actual evidence that shows that cutting out the bench seat actually does
&gt; weaken the bus? I personally don't see how it affects anything since the
bus
&gt; has a roof and a floor to keep it's shape, and you don't see any bulkheads
&gt; through the rest of the bus to help keep it's shape. Unless you count the
&gt; metal that seperates the engine bay from the interior.
