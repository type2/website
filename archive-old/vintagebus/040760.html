...timed it, it was perfect.  Oh, and now the oil light comes on at idle
after my last trip around the block to check on things, yet the dipstick
reads full.  Any ideas?

&gt;Some things that come to my mind are points and dwell, cap and rotor, leaky
vacuum advance, or sticky mechanical.  My squareback once started dogging
for no particular reason, it was because the 009 had crap in it that kept it
from fully advancing.  Twisting the rotor solved that.
