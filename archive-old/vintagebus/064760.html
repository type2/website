Hi Ray,
The problem with silicon is the vibration and flexing of the body.  Not many 
aquariums are driven daily over rough roads!  Silicon and most other sealants 
we tried for windshield seals only lasted six months or less.  3M body 
sealant lasted two years in an experiment before the bus owner rolled her bus 
and continued to drive it.  The windshields began to leak there after and we 
squirted tar under the seal which stopped the leaks.  The reason we did not 
try a second windshield experiement with the 3M body sealant was it was too 
sticky making installation of window seals a nightmare.  Where with tar the 
window and seal slides in slick as snot and has been leak free for about 8 
years now.
  Using Silicon sealant over a large area will probably work even if the 
silicon only continues to stick on 50% of the surface area, but that still 
leaves 50% to leak.
