Subject: Re: [VB] 1961 Panel

Hi Mike,
From what we have heard the replacement tanks are made of a thinner  sheet 
metal than the stock ones were.  Signs of seepage is not unusual  since when the 
fuel tank is overfilled and/or the bus is parked tilted to  the right side 
fuel can leak out the gas cap.  If enough comes  out it drips down the tank neck 
making it look like seepage from lower  down the neck.  We went with the 
1968-71 bus fifteen gallon gas tank  in our 1963 SC and 1960 panel walk thru panel 
camper conversion.   Definitely was worth the work for us!!  Both also have 
the reserve valve  installed.
