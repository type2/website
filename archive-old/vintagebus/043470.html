&gt;Got the '59 Kombi 1600cc DP engine that I just overhauled back in and 
&gt;all hooked up. [...] The engine wouldn't fire-up for nothin'!!! [...]
&gt;Closest thing I could figure is maybe the coil ain't cuttin' it.

Did you put new points and condenser in the distributor?  A bum 
condenser will keep you from running, as my Dad found out from
experience on his '74 Bug.

Also, the higher the cylinder pressure, the more energy it takes to
make a spark.  The coil may have been able to fire the plugs on a
tired engine, but on a new, tight engine, it may not be cutting it.

Finally, I have found that the rotor works best when it is inside
the distributor.  When it's sitting on the engine tin it doesn't
work as well.  :)  I usually do that at least once per tune-up on
a VW.  This is probably not your problem, though.
