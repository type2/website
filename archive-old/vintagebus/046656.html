Funny thing is I recognize about three or four photos that I personally took 
and uploaded onto various other websites.

 Hey list,
  Finally got my trucks ONLY site up to releasable status (at least i think
 so). Contains pretty much everything for a truck fan. Year to year with
 pics, restoration help, truck m-codes, truck toys, truck literature,
 accessories,etc. Even got some old commercials in wav format. Go check it
 out and lemme know what you guys think, or if you see probs. I tried to make
 it a point not to have pics that other sites have, so most everything you
 see will be new. More to follow as time allows.
