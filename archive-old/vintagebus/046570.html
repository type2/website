&quot;_Just_ find a 64-67 roof&quot;?  How many 21 window roof clips do you guys see
for sale a year?  I can think of 2 in the last 3 yrs and I'm sitting in
sunny CA.  As far as the rear hatch question, someone had suggested (on the
list) &quot;grafting&quot; the skylights and sunroof into the existing roof rather
than replacing the whole thing.  The last 23 window I saw for sale that was
running was $10g's.  The last 23 window I saw that was not running and rusty
went for $5g's.  &quot;just go buy a deluxe&quot;? ;o)
&gt;&gt;

Think about this people.  the guy wants to cut the roof off of a 55 23 window 
and put it on a 66.  why not use the 66 as a donor bus and cut as much usable 
sheet metal out of it and fix the 55?  the 55 would end up being a cooler bus 
with nicer bumpers, smaller hatch and at the very least a much better color 
if painted back to stock.   
And dont tell me about rust (if thats why the 55 is unrestorable).  you all 
can look at the metwiz's web page and check out my labor of love 58 15 
window.  I have owned that bus for over 10 years and have vowed to fix it at 
any cost.  it is actually cheeper then you think if you do some of the work 
yourself.  i think i would rather pull up a cargo floor anyday then to 
replace a roof clip.

Not trying to start a fight,  but why isnt the 55 being saved or given a 
chance?
