I like to build stuff.

Clocks.  Cars.  Engines of all types, including steam.  Firearms.  Machine
tools.  Ships.  Boats.  Kayaks.  Airplanes.  Nuclear power plants.  Towers.
Radio transmitters &amp; receivers.  Computers.  Houses.  Concrete structures of
all types.  Ditto for steel structures.

I also like to solve puzzles.

The Navy retired me.  Haynes Publications fired me.  Qual-comm, General
Atomic and 87 other firms refused to hire me.  Square peg in a world of round
holes; the puzzle I've yet to solve.
