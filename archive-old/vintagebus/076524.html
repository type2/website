Subject: Re: [VB] Re: [T2] 71 engine into 65

&gt; Some time back, someone on this site suggested J-B welding a nut to the back
 side of the engine flange to receive that &quot;mean and nasty' bolt.
 It's still hard to reach the bolt, but at least I didn't have to reach in to
 hold the nut.
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

The problem I see is that the early transaxles used a D bolt on the 'meam and nasty' side which was held from
turning by a V in the bellhousing. Then you can tighten the nut on the engine side.
On doghouse engines, they pressed in a threaded insert into the case. Then a regular bolt went in from the
bell housing side. The bell housing on these later cars then lost the cast V that held the D bolt. When you
screw in a hex head bolt into a bell housing that has a V in it, it actually locks in place and it takes a
miracle to get it out. I use a Allen head bolt because it is round and can't lock in place.
