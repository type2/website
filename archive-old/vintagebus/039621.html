Hey All,

I aquired a deluxe short middle seat over the weekend and would like to 
trade it for a full length or 2/3 roof rack.  Both of these items are bulky 
so someone in the South East would be great!  I'm in Upstate SC about an 
hour south of Asheville, NC.  Drop me a line if your interested.

Thanks,

Eric
