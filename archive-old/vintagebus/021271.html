On my engine lid, the right side hinge has separated from the hinge...

I'm wanting a quick repair that isn't a lot of work... I'd rather spend
reasonable money than take on another project :)

In finding a replacement, should I be concerned about the year -- or the
fact this is a truck vs. a bus?  It does have a light over the license plate
(even works)...

Going rate?  Anyone have a perfect one to sell?  A not perfect one that you
would be willing to make perfect and sell?

I am also seeking all new hinges, both body and lid sides... someone
indicated to me that NOS ones were going for $20 a pair?

if the hinge itself is bad, you can (usually with effeort) remove and replace 
the hinge.   Unscrews from bus, unscrews from lid.    same as early bay 
windows- the later ones are obviously different.   If the decklid is broken, 
that's more of a pain, but doable    yours is 59 through 63 -    needs the 
attachment for the elbow which is differnt than the attachment for  the 
spring.

VW recommends oiling hinges every 1200 miles.  Have you?   Has anyone?  
course not.  add the hinge oiling routine to your tuneup procedure to make 
them last longer.
