Another sign of intentional obsolesce from VW. Quick and easy way to make a
customer buy a new vehicle is to make it rust from the inside out. Although
from what I can remember Bay window busses don't have any water drain holes
in the tops of doglegs at all.
 
The upper water drain in the dogleg is almost completely useless in the
function of getting water to the ground. As stated by several list members
these should be cleaned or else the big hunks of crud will build up and hold
water. If you think about it that section of the dogleg could hold about one
cup of water. Not good. But what if the damage has already begun and you
don't have the dough to replace the dogleg with a tube that properly siphons
the water to the ground. Well stop the water from going in the top drain in
the first place. Get a can of your preferred rust preventative paint, spray
it in the hole with a WD40 style spray tube (you know the red coffee straw
taped to the side of a WD40 can you stick on the spray head). Spray the
inside of the dogleg, everywhere you can reach, then put a plug in the hole
that will fit, along with some RTV silicone and Vola!, no more water to that
rusty part of your bus. The water that used to go down the hole and feed the
rust goblins in your dogleg now drains down the outside of your bus. Ok,
it's not simple. cause now you have to make sure your rubber foam door seal
doesn't trap water against this part of your bus. carefully remove your seal
and clean and paint the seams then glue the seal back in. Now you should be
done down there. Remember to only do this to the upper Dogleg drain hole,
cause the bottom one has a more direct route out of the panel about two
inches instead of the ten inches or so of snaking between body panels for
the upper drain hole. 
 
Next step, completely rebuild your sliding windows so water does not get
there in the first place.
 
I know I'll get flack for this one. :-}
