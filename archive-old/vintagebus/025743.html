&quot;Buses are reliable and easily and cheaply fixable.&quot;

Chris nailed it with that one.

Instead of wondering about who drives VWs, let's think about WHY people
still are driving AC VWs.

Buzzy, cramped (bugs anyway) no AC, minimal heat, no power, spartan
accommodations, miserable handling...just a few comments I hear.

I drive my bug because I can fix it myself.  I refuse to work on my wife's
Toyota - looks like a bad day at a steam plant under the hood.

I drive my bug because it's different - even though they were once common.

I'm restoring my bus because I enjoy learning about VWs (my Bentley and
Muir, they comfort me)

I'll drive them both because most of the time they're just plain fun.

Sorry if I'm skirting the topic - but I could care less about who likes VWs,
more interested in why they do, because we're all different - thank
goodness!
