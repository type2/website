&gt;It sounds like their are a few that are interested in this. I am working on
&gt;finding a supplier for the plastic sleeve material (leads anyone???). I have
&gt;already made the molds for the caps.
&gt;Unfortunately for everyone except me, I just sold my house this weekend and
&gt;will spending most of my free time packing and looking for a new house. So
&gt;my disclaimer is I will be doing them but it will probably be after the
&gt;first of the year before they are ready. As far as cash up front, I don't
&gt;think that will be necessary.
&gt;Anyone have a house they want to sell in North Tacoma in the $125 to $175
&gt;range?
&gt;Thanks

&gt;
&gt;   Shawn,
&gt;
&gt;     YES! I planned on using a bay middle seat for my 21w and upholstering it
&gt;in vintage style. I would buy a kit to add the grab handles. Need some $$ to
&gt;get started?

&gt;   List
&gt;   Oh the ever sought after middle seat!!
&gt;
&gt;   I am wanting to re-sleeve my middle seat grab bars (63) and noticed that
&gt;the
&gt;   material on the dash grab handle is the same. since the dash handle is
&gt;   reproduced does anyone know who makes them or can supply me with that
&gt;   material? I am also in the process of making molds of the chrome end
&gt;pieces
&gt;   (Deluxes and Standards 62 to 67) so I can reproduce them. My idea is to
&gt;sell
&gt;   the pieces separately, to allow people to either fix the seats they have,
&gt;or
&gt;   to sell them a conversion kit to add to a bay window seat.
&gt;   If this sounds like a good idea to anyone please p-mail me to let me know,
&gt;   for right know I am only making one and reproducing them for sale is only
&gt;an
&gt;   idea.
&gt;   Thanks
&gt;   Shawn
