Subject: RE: [VB] [F] any UK listees want to get me some beer?

Sounds like you just need a good vodka martini... and just let the
bottle of vermouth sit *next* to the glass for a minute or so, that'll
make it dry enough.

Or, go find your self a Belgium Trappist beer... mmmmm Westmalle...

trivia for this Friday: you can put 18 cases of beer in the belly of a
single cab :-)

perhaps there is a yank beer you want, and we could swap.

&lt;from his post&gt; after working on the craptacular aluminum motor last
night, i settled in with a nice st. peter's cream stout.... now i need a
bottle of 
their king cnut (made with stinging nettles!), but their u.s. 
distributor doesn't carry it.
i can't think of a better beer for drinking after working on the POS 
aluminum case - unless they have a beer made with poison sumac.
