&gt; I am thinking of pumping the special liquid used by model airplanes into the
&gt; exhaust tialpipe with an electric pump.
&gt; They used it on the nitro powered model engines to make smoke, but I don't
&gt; know if I could make it copius enough for effect.
&gt; I'd love to say &quot;activate smoke screen!&quot;, and produce a detering, but not
&gt; dangerous effect, don't need them too close AND blind./
