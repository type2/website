&gt; How about each listmember kicks down $25 and buys the bus. We could
&gt; hand it off from show to show like that hubcap.  There's approximately
&gt; 500 list members; if everyone kicked in, that would be $12.5k

Funny, seems I've heard that suggestion a month or so ago somewhere.

Look, in my original statement re: Jim's bus I fully intended it to be an
example of a bus that should be selling for much more than the 12,500.  I
think it is worth at least that if not more.  Just my opinion.
