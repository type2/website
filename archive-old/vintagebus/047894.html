 &gt; Here's what the &quot;Old Cars Price Guide&quot; has to say about ballpark values
 &gt; for a mid-60s single cab:
 &gt; 
 &gt; 1--mint condition (trailer queen):  $11,500
 &gt; 2--well-restored or excellent original: $8,100
 
 What does this pub say about a mid-60's crew cab?

well the word down the local pub doesn't say anything about mid sixties crew 
cabs.  There aren't any in town, though there are a few bay window crews.   
But those people dont drink there.
