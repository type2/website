Subject: progress (65 Samba)

Just thought i would toss out there a quick update on the bus.  This is
the restoration of my 65 Samba back to original.  I have been at it for
3+years and not have a hard deadline of March, 2001.

I have been working on the interior moslty.  I bought a set of TMI's
seat covers (origianl grey S&amp;P) and enough material to make up my own
door panels and other misc parts.  That is almost done.  I have the
front seats done and the rear is almost there.  The seat covers fit real
nice.  Very tight.  I used TMI's cusions also.  (except the middle seat
because it is not available)  I was very impressed with the covers.  The
door panels are not yet installed.  I am waiting on some welting for the
top of the panels.  I have installed the parts for the partition and
they look great.  I am also waiting for a few trim pieces from a fellow
listee.

I pulled the rim's off last week and took them to get blasted.
Yesterday i painted the back side white.  I plan to paint the face
today.  I hope to get the new rubber on mext week and then get them on
the bus in another week.  Those will look good especially when i get the
trim rings and hupcaps on.

I started to build the motor last night.  So far only one slip up.  I
went and damaged the main #1 bearing so i had to get another set.  I
hope that is all i have to re-buy.  I plan to get the long block
together today.

Other then that, things are going good.  My last big order of bisness is
to find a few outstanding parts (see next email for parts needed) and
figure out my electrical gremlins.

Thanks for reading.
Matt
