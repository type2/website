Red paint is then only paint I know that is more expensive than other paint.
The main difference in paint cost is the quality. PPG, DuPont, Glasurit are
the best, in my opinion. Metalic paint is definately harder to paint than
non-metallic, especially gold or silver metallic. If you're letting someone
else do it, let the painter pick the brand. That way, he or she will be
familiar with how it behaves.

Solder is great. A lot of high quality restoration shops will only use
solder. The problem is finding someone that can do it, it's a dying art. If
you can spare the bucks, go with solder.

Some high quality shops are using metal filler now. It has the same
water-proof substrate as fiberglass, but it has aluminum particles in it
instead of fiberglass. My paint supplier swears by it. They told me that
when it sets, its as hard as metal and can even be grinded like metal.

&gt;Two questions here. I want to paint my bus yellow below the belt and white
&gt;on the top. Question I have is is it true that some colors are harder/more
&gt;expensive to paint than others? I plan to either do it myself or have it
&gt;done, whichever seems more viable. I have no experience except with model
&gt;car painting, which I'm sure is much different. Other question is, everyone
&gt;around here I've talked to about bodywork says
&gt;fiberglass,fiberglass,fiberglass. I read in auto magazines and books about
&gt;the 'old fashioned way with lead'. What gives here? It seems here in
&gt;Michigan people would want to do things that way, seems it would last
&gt;longer, here in the salt belt. Thanks for any help.
