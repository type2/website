   A lot of response on this question, now the problem.
  The company willing to do this has had years of experience in the
aftermarket sheet metal bisiness for other makes of vehicals, I have seen
and used there other products with great sucess. Now the problem, finding
original and/or OG sheet metal to copy. Like I mentioned they do have an NOS
OG front floor which they will copy, they NEED straight original pieces to
copy. I am cutting up a 59 panel with perfect rockers and doglegs to copy
and am working on getting a 67 delux that has been stripped to get it's
doglegs and lower front valance and frame structure to copy. It seems that
corners are way up on the list of parts so does anybody have a NOS or
perfect OG corner they would like to loan for copying. I was told that they
can mirror a part so only one would be needed. 
   As for the pressed bumpers, that is a posability, but again they would
need NOS or perfect ones to copy.
I am going to send them splash pans for rear pressed bumper and the rear
brackets to see what can be done.

  There goal is to have some parts made to unvail at the Classic this year,
they have asked me for cargo floors as they feel there is a big demand for
those. 
  I am working on getting some more of the OE VW Brazil floors over here
(ask Terry Wolfe, he's used them), it's strange but the VW factory still
stamps out the floors but does not allow import to the U S A. I am getting
these from one of my German importers, these are available in Germany, but
not the U S. This is still at least 3 months away, as a container just
landed last week, hurray, more German e-brake cables finally, along with hub
cap clips and other assorted German parts.
  Today I will find out quanities of parts needed to be made in order to get
this moving.

ps.  I am not exclusive to this and these parts will be available direct or
through there dealers once made, I am just trying to help get this done, but
I am a dealer (plug)
