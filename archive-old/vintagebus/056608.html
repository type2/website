--------------------------------------

&gt; ...the ZebraSafari is finally over, thanks to the Stuttgart cops.  &gt;Indeed, Africa was a breeze compared to &quot;more civilised&quot; lands. But that &gt;also shows the power of passion and purpose.  
&gt;
&gt;Cape to Cairo in a vintage VW bus was my dream; getting to London was 
&gt;just a nice idea.  I guess the universe was telling us, via our travails &gt;since Cairo, that it was time to wrap things up and find something else &gt;to do.
&gt;
&gt;We have spent the weekend in Paris visiting friends, and we catch a bus
&gt;to London tonight, where we'll spend some time with my brother before &gt;flying home.  In London I'll also be approaching some publishers about &gt;the book I intend to write about this journey!
