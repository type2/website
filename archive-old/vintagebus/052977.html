Subject: Re: [VB] UHaul Horror Story? (fwd)


I planned a move from LA to San Francisco several years ago, and
'reserved' with U-Haul. Didn't know anything about them back then. Day
came and they didn't have the truck. In a panic, I called all over  and
finally found a Ryder dealer who had a spare truck same size, only two
miles away. It took months to get the deposit refunded from the credit
card.

Needless to say, never again U-Haul.

cal


never far!
