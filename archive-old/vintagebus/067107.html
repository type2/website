 The '58-'67 parts book at the doc project lists just one part number,
211 501 201, for both axles, but also says &quot;see Workshop Bulletin.&quot;

I doubt there is such a book as a 58-67 parts book.

I have seen parts lists that are editions from 56, 58, 61, 63, etc.  And 
versions updated through various years, such as through 70.   As of 68 there 
was a entirely different list for parts for bays, so you could have a splitty 
parts list that was updated through 70 or whatever year, that was only 
splitties, no bay buses.
However, AFAIS, they never cut off the beginning year for splitty parts 
lists,  though parts did become superceded and NLA, and were omitted from 
later versions.

I looked up the number in a 58 edition, which likewise had just the one 
number.   That is a book published in 58, has no parts introduced 59 or 
later, and is more complete for barndoors than a later version, as fewer 
parts were NLA.  Same info was in the online  updated 63 edition re axle 
shafts.   Referense to WS bulletin is about which paint coded version you 
use, I think.

just a pet peeeve of mine.   I dunno if folks realise the meaning of '58-67' 
parts list isn't very accurate.
