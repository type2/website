Subject: Original Engine Comparment Insulation Problem

I have the original four pieces of insulation in the &quot;roof&quot; of my 70 engine
compartment. The largest piece sags quite a bit. I have taken it out and
reflattened it but it sags again after a short time. Has this problem been
addressed and solved? Maybe in the achieves? (I don't find the achieves
search friendly). I'm thinking aluminum sheets cut to fit over the original
insulation might work.
