Subject: Mexico Trip/ I-5 listees

Hello List:

Been off the list for a while trying to get my page put back together
and get ready for a big ol splitty journey.

Kelli Jo and I are setting off in our 65 Kombi this December 15 for Baja
and Mainland Mexico. Our preparations have been extensive, and I have
every confidence that we will make the 4000 mile plus trip in good
shape. I will not go into all the preparations for fear of boring you
all to tears VanBondo trip-report style. (Hi Jim :P)

But the jist of the message is that we are gonna be headed down the ol
Interstate Numero 5 through the great state o California and were
wondering who might see clear to letting us camp in their driveway.
We are thinking of stopping somewhere between Redding and Sacramento our
first or second evening, Perhaps halfway between there and San Diego the
next, and San Diego the evening after that.  Our departure date is
probably going to end up being nearer to Dec 20, with final preparations
and all.  This puts us really near Christmas, and probably not such a
great time to drop in on some folks. 

We have everything we will need, food, bed, even bathroom facilities (
don't ask unless you really want to know) and will leap out at the crack
of dawn. We had thought to stay in parkinglots if we get no offers...but
I thought it would be fun to maybe meet some listees if we get the
chance. I would be pissed if anyone pulled  a stunt like passing through
MY town and didn't give me a yell.

We will be coming back up through Arizona in March and were hoping to
ask the same of Arizona folks. I know one set of people in Tempe, but
they are not listees. We are gonna stay at my grandmother's house in
Green Valley for a day or two, but were hoping to see a certain
rusto-ration in the Phoenix area, should we be invited.....

Please p-mail me any flames, guffaws, or invites, as I sometimes don't
read all my list mail ( the shame!) 


PS. The odds makers have it at 5-3 against us coming home with the same
engine.

PPS I just updated the VWWO webpage, and will soon have another update
with more info on our plans and route in Mexico. We *will* be visiting
teh factory in Puebla!
