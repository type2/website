Subject: Re: [VB] bus front suspension question/problem

yes, but when the torsion bars went bad, they snapped in two- the guy though 
his whole wheel fell off, as it suddenly dropped out from under him.

How are your shocks?  I like the  KYB GR-2s.  Checked you r tire pressure 
recently?  Seat need repadding? really bad king pins do give thunks and a 
sudden change in steering direction.   Muir in the idiot book gives a good 
description of checking out the steering.  But steering is not quite the same 
as ride. hmmmmmmmm

I do have extra sets of torsion bars FWIW

 Hi everyone,
 Has anyone heard of front torsion bars going bad. For some reason the front 
 of my 63 deluxe rides extremeley rough. Like a 1-ton truck. ok, maybe not 
 that bad.
 Could it possibly be the torsion leaves have gone bad or maybe the king pin 
 needle bearings need replacing.
 Does anyone know of a way to test a front suspension?
 Yesterday I picked up a drum to drum front beam out of a wrecked 62 single 
 cab. It's complete but was lowered by pulling torsion leaves. Now I'm stuck 
 with re-using my existing torsion leaves which I hadn't planned to. 
 Anyone have any suggestions or spare torsion bars they would like to sell.
