&gt; &gt; The difference is that nobody is going to mistake a HO-scale boxcar for
&gt; &gt; a product of the BNSF railroad, nor would the BNSF be endangered
&gt; &gt; legally by an accident involving one of these boxcars.
&gt;
&gt; The last time I checked no one has ever been hurt in a collision with a
&gt; fan based web site!

No, but they could be hurt by following maintainance procedures found on
those websites.  At least that is how the suits at VW seem to see it.

Their lawyers are paid to do things, and if those tasks include slapping
down some poor guy who has a VW symbol on his site they will find this
easier than doing real work.
