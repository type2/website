&lt;&lt; Heres my question as I do not want to buy a new crank shaft.... 
  &gt;&gt;

One time along time ago, I had a problem with my gland nut coming loose and
the  dowels coming out of the crank end (or messing them up). We had the
machine shop do what all the hot rod boys do, 8 dowel it. This should work for
you also.
