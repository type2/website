&lt;&lt; Hello,
  I'm new here, so please forgive me if my questions
 sound a little silly. I have a 1960 Kombi that is
 about 60% done, a friend of mine brought me a middle
 seat last week that obviously was not for this year
 and model, it appears to be a 2/3 seat with the arm
 rest(grab handle?) on the passenger side where my
 cargo doors are. The brackets on the belly pan don't
 even come close to matching up,can anyone tell me what
 year and model this might fit. I'd like to sell it,
 but I need some info so I don't mislead anyone. Any
 and all info would be greatly appreciated. &gt;&gt;


What it sounds like you have is a bench seat kombi right?  What you want then 
is a full length seat with a folding backrest (near the doors)  Just look at 
the floor (belly pans are under the floors on certain buses) if you have 
welded in brackets for a seat just inside the cargo doors (just past the 
sill), then that is what you need.

The 2/3 middle seat was most commony used on walkthru busses (busses with 
bucket front seats.)  I think ill put together a page with al the different 
middle seats in a day or two so you can see the diferent seats.
