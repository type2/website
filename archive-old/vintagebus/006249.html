Could someone please send me Jerry Jess' e-mail address?

(bus content) I managed to get the third bus that I bought out of the dirt and got wheels on it. However I also managed to pull two thirds of the frame out from under it while trying to get it to a place where I could get the trailer. It must have sunk into the dirt twenty years ago. Oh well it was only parts any way.
