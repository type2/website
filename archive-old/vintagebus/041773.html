&gt; HI,
&gt; 
&gt; Regarding no fresh air tubes:
&gt; 
&gt; I suspect that back pressure is only increased by only a marginal
&gt; amount. What might really be happening to increase engine temp is that
&gt; the temperature of the exhaust tube goes waayy up and thus more heat
&gt; is transfered back into the heads.

Hmmm, what does this say about the hot-rodder's practice of wrapping the
pipes in fiberfrax insulation?  They claim that this increases power, and
more back-pressure certainly wouldn't do that!

IN any case, I'm happier with the tubes hooked up and operating as the
designers intended.
