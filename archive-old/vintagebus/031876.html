Hi Kyle,
Actually the problem with the acid getting under the mat is that it attacks 
the exposed original VW high zinc content primer around and in trace amounts 
on the bare metal areas.  Without this zinc primer the steel is exposed even 
more beyond the direct friction areas of the mat.  Which in a wierd way is 
actually polishing away the rust where it the mat is in constant contact with 
the steel!
   Zinc primering is the only way we know of to prevent rust from making it's 
way through rock chips and cracks in the paint to forming rust tunnels under 
the good paint and thrusting up and off the paint later.  Eric&amp;Barb
