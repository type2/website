Chris,
When the city gave me grief for not having an engine in the DC and parking it in
my drive, I quickly dropped the engine and duct taped the windshields in place
until I got the window rubber.  Drove that way for a few weeks.  Reading your list
below the first paragraph below, it looks like there is a bit more than just
windshields that the DD needs before the trip!

You going to bring some of those fancy new steering wheels with you?

&gt; Hi,
&gt;
&gt; The question is:  Should I tape the windshields back in for the
&gt; weekend and drive on down to OCTO and Irvine, or should I just drive
&gt; the %#anger truck?
&gt;
&gt; The DD has not been started in 2 years, the oil is at least 4 years
&gt; old, the battery is dead, the gas may be congealed in the tank, half
&gt; the nose skin has been removed, the passenger head light is missing
&gt; ( maybe I can duck tape it into place ), the jelousies on the
&gt; passenger side have been removed, and I have no spare time unless I
&gt; stop sleeping.
&gt;
&gt; I need your votes. If the yays beat the nays, I stop sleeping at least
&gt; until I hit the freeway on Friday to go to West Coast Classics.
&gt;
