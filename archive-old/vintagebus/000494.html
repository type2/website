&lt;&lt; No.  What should those be for a 30pict?&gt;&gt;
Hi Steve,
What size engine, air cleaner, and muffler?  It is not the carburator you set 
what size jets for but these factors, and even which engine compartment used 
in.

&lt;&lt;Thanks.  BTW which ones are which?  Main, idle, air correction &gt;&gt;
Main is the one inside of the resevoir plug.  Idle is the one on the right of 
the carburator.  Air correction is the flute looking one in the forward side 
of the throat of the carburator.  All should be brass, though some recent 
replacement main jets are made out of white plastic.  Eric&amp;Barb
