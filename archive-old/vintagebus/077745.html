   I was just informed through motor vehicles that VW's ARE NOT
considered classic cars. Motor vehicles bases there information on what
is supplied to them by CCCA (classic car club of america) I went down
their list of CLASSIC's and nowhere was VW to be found!!!!!!, but our
motor vehicles does consider them HISTORIC.
   It would be cool maybe if we did a survey on each state's classic
plate requirements to see what other states think and/or use as their
guideline for classic car plates
