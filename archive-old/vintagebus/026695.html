I have to agree.  VW has consistently said F you to the vintage community when it comes to supporting the vintage enthusiasts!  In addition VWAG and possibly VWOA have been ruthless in the pursuit of enthusiasts web sites.  Threatening legal action if their site was not taken down.

The ONLY reason they are using vintage VW in their marketing efforts is because nostalgia sells.  Look at the sales of the new beetle.  Sitting and waiting for the behemoth corporation to become nice and give you something is pitifully.  Corporations never give anything away unless it benefits them...ie makes them more money.

I have always found it irritating that VW, in South Africa
at least, are quick to hire their immaculately resto'd vintage products to
use in ads but are not nearly as enthusiastic when it comes to maintaining
even the smallest store of parts beyond the level of fan belts and spark
plugs.
