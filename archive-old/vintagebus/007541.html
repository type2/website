Subject: spindle - bearing trouble
Date: Tue, 24 Apr 2001 18:56:04 -0500
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

So I got one front bearing off by destroying it.  I'm fairly busy these days
so I don't have the time to work on my bus that I would like.  Anyway,
shouldn't that outer bearing just slide off.  Muir talks about a screw
driver to pull them out but that's not working, it's like they are seized
onto the spindle.  When I do finally get this other one off I was thinking
about emry cloth on the spindle, but I'm wondering how far I should go.
Should this bearing just slide off or what.
