Saw the post on this ignition and thought I would comment.  I just put
one of these on my 63 ragtop bug with a 1776cc engine.  This is a hot
set up.  My engine has never been so strong and responsive.  I highly
recommend this set up to anyone.  I did order mine from J.C. Whitney,
but it was only $84.95.  It set up in under 1 hour.  I also have a
friend who has been using the xr700 in his 914 and it also has been
trouble free for over a year now.  If anyone has any questions feel free
to email me.
