Subject: RE: [VB] domed pistons?

didn't early type 3's (1500 S) have domed pistons? i don't think they
weren't super domed, but..
i guess it all depends, too, on what &quot;REALLY&quot; means, ans if there are any
sizes or part numbers on them or the box.


&gt; [Original Message]
&gt; I've been helping my friend who bought a big VW stash. We came across
some 
&gt; domed pistons. Were these for race engines or something? These things
were 
&gt; REALLY domed!
&gt;
