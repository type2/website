Subject: cables

In my 57 panel, I have two cables below the seat. One to the left and 
one to the right of the heater control knob. They are both frozen solid. 
I have given them an occasional douse of penetrating oil but still can't 
seem to pull or push them loose. I disconnected the reserve lever from 
one of them to see if I could pull on the wire from the back end. No 
luck. Do I need to actually remove the whole cable to get them freed? 
Any suggestions how to make them operational? does the other cable 
control a choke?
