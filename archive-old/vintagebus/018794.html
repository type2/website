howdy all
a few weeks back i remember all the toy busses everyone was talking about, but
i didnt really care because i didnt want to go to a vw show and pay $10 for a
1/800 scale tiny bus that looks nothing like one, but today in walmart i found
those 'drag busses' with the insane 20&quot; rims in the back and the obnoxious
spoiler on it in 1/20 scale and it was georgus, but i didnt have $25 on me, so
i pouted and tried to con my lady friend into buying it for me, no go. beh, i
went on my merry way, and found a 'road and track show stoppers' samba 21
window bus pulling a bug on a trailer and they are both in the green/blue/grey
that the soon to be mine 58 sc pickup is in!!! and if that wasnt enough the
beetle (marked 73 but has some weird thing with the seates not being slanted
or something so its a pre 67, as my daddy-o had one) it was a wonderful trip
and it was only $15 with tax!!! i dont know if these were mentioned before but
hey its mine and that makes it worth repeating. my meaningless rant of
happiness for the day
