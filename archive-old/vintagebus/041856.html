&gt; Hi NQ,
&gt; Hmm, if memory serves right Porshe 356 engines used bigger valves witout the 
&gt; dual springs!  

Dual springs are there for two reasons:

First, they can supply more closing force in the same volume.
Second, using two springs eliminates the single frequency of resonance
that might cause problems at high RPMS.

You only need enough closing force to cause the valve to follow the
closing side of the cam, plus a bit more to prevent bounce.  If you're
using a stock cam and rockers at normal RPM, then stock valve springs are 
all you need.  Stronger/double springs will only increase wear and
friction.

OTOH, if you are using a cam with a high lift, steep profile, or are
running at high RPMS, then you will need stronger springs to keep the
lifter on the cam.  The exact tension required is an engineering decision 
that requires careful analyis.  Most hot-rodders eschew this, opting for
the strongest springs available and living with the increased wear.

The elegant solutions to this is to go to desmodronic valves as used on
Ducati motorcycles.  they use no springs to close the valves, relying
instead on a 2-way valve train that uses the cam to both open and close
the valves.  Not a bad system if you can live with 500-mile valve
adjustment intervals!
