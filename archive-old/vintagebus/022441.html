&gt;I was about to install the intake manifold on my 1500 SP engine, when I
&gt;decided to check Muir to make sure I didn't dork it up.
&gt;
&gt;Muir refers to copper &quot;gaskets&quot; - which I successfully located in my gasket
&gt;set.
&gt;
&gt;However, as I looked at the intake port on the head, it appears that there
&gt;is a (much flatter) copper seal in there already.  Preliminary poking at it
&gt;makes me think it doesn't want to come out very easily.

The gaskets start round, then crush as you tighten the manifold.  They're
good for one use.

Gently pry the old one out, slip the new one in, and awaaayyy you go!
