All those interested in the demise of the Web-posted &quot;Sermons&quot;, whatever
their positions/opinions in this egregious matter,  should go to the
website formerly occupied by those learned treatises and read the
author's letter posted thereon.

As another has recently written, the events of the past week represent
merely the tip of an apparently very large iceberg.  The iceberg's center
of gravity finally became sufficiently elevated as to cause it to
overturn with catastrophic results.

&lt;For Obligatory Bus content see Subject Line above.&gt;
