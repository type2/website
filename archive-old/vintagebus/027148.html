&gt; I don't claim to be an expert on anything, hey I'm just a teacher, but I do
&gt; have a late model '67 westy with the drive away tent that has a floor and 2
&gt; pockets for the carge doors, one on each side.  The tent is the blue and
&gt; orange one, with the external frame and striped awnings.

Rick, that might be a real rare model you've got -- I've never seen or
heard of that Add-a-room tent being available and designed for
pre-sliding door buses.  I'd love to see some pix and would like to add
the info to the site.  See
http://www.supernet_dot_net/~jclark/vw/loaves.html for all I have on the
Add-a-room (what I originally called the &quot;Drive-Away&quot;).

&gt; And on that note, it is now 3:05 pm, time to go home and play with my
&gt; busses!  We may not get payed much, but have nice working hours.

Aw, heshup. :-)
