Sounds like you need a bentley manual, and to spend some time looking
at my site and some of the work I've done.  The outer body work is going
to be pretty much the same whether it's a panel or a deluxe.

&gt; I am restoring a '58 to '62 panel that has a lot of rust around the bottom

&gt; I should go through all mechanicals as well.  I will probably farm out the
&gt; paint, but I plan on doing the welding and mechanical work my self. Panels
&gt; don't have much interior to deal with, so I am not concerned with that. The
&gt; books I have bought so far. Seem to have excluded type 2 info, focusing on
&gt; type 1 and type 3 VWs instead. Getting to the point, I need a book that
&gt; shows me details of body panels and gives me a breakdown on all mechanicals
&gt; including the mysterious reduction boxes.
