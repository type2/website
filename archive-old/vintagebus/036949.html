Subject: Gas Mileage Problems (again)
Message-ID: &lt;8a99ffd2.2484b2de_at_aol_dot_com&gt;

Hi everyone,
To start off, I searched the archives and no luck.
I am getting really crappy gas mileage in my 63 deluxe.
Roughly 13 mpg on the freeway. I'm only able to make it around 140 miles per 
tank at 70 mph
I have a 1600dp with a 009 and 30 pic w/ satock oil bath. Stock bus trans.
Choke is adjusted but plugs still come out black.
Do I need carb work, new jets, float, choke
I have installed new plugs, wires, valve adjustment, etc...
This is getting to be dissapointing expecially as I plan to drive to Southern 
Ca for the Classic in a few weeks. I'd really like to make it without 
stopping ecvery two hours for gas.
Can anyone offer any good suggestions

Thanks in advance,
