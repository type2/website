Here's why... Last winter, I lunched the engine in Osterbus, My '66 Westy.
This was due to
my driving it around with only three gears (cause I'm a dumbass). So, I
decided that it was time to take the engine and trans out and get them
redone. I decided to let my &quot;friend&quot; and admittedly very good VW mechanic
Brian (NOT CRUSTY) do the job (cause I'm a dumbass). He was down on his luck
and needed extra money and I felt sorry for him (cause I'm a dumbass). He
said it wouldn't be too expensive and I believed him (see above).
I traded my old '61 ragtop in terrible shape for a nice-running 1600
single-port engine.
Then when Brian (NOT CRUSTY) had the trans out I took it to a noted local
buggy racer and he rebuilt the trans and the redux boxes (only non-dumbass
move I made so far). This took a couple weeks and over the time my bus was
apart in Brian's (NC) shop he continually hit me up for money, &quot;he had a
tool man to pay&quot;, &quot;he had a tooth bothering him and had to go to the
dentist&quot; &quot;his wife said I should pay half up front&quot; blah blah blah until now
I've paid him all the money we agreed on up front, and he has no incentive
to finish up my bus, it's sat for a week and he hasn't touched it. The
engine I've traded for needs to be converted from a 12V system to the 6V
system in my bus and he's complaining that it's going to cost a lot more
'cause that's a lot of work, I've also given him a new clutch cable,
accelerator cable and new rear brake shoes and wheel cylinders and asked him
to install those while the bus is apart and easy to work on. Well, he won't
take my calls, he hasn't lifted a finger on my bus since all the parts were
delivered to his garage and I'm doing the &quot;bang head here&quot; bit on the wall,
because, as my wife reminded me just last night &quot;you're a dumbass, to pay
him all that money up front&quot;.
My bus is on jack stands and I'm on the edge of freakin' out. I don't know
what to do.
