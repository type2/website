&lt;&lt; your gonna &quot;blast&quot; the engine at the do it yourself car wash? is this a 
good 
 idea? lots of stuff that really shouldnt get wet in there. get some simple 
 green and a few rolls of paper towels. &gt;&gt;
I've done this myself several times with no ill affects. coversd the 
distributer with a tightly tied plastis bag.  stuffed a rag in the top of the 
carb and covered it with plastic too. pull it all off replace air cleaner a 
drive away. Lots of hacked up bugs get wet engines up here in the great north 
west for most of the year.
