Look at the part that says &quot;Volkswagen Village&quot;. It's probably just 
hats and shirts and multi-hundred dollar remote controlled new 
beetles...but it could be some of their NOS stash! Yeah...I know it's 
dreaming, but you never know.

I doubt they'd want SV2s and Hot Dog Fred selling brats there, 
though...heheh
