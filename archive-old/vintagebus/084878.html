&gt;
&gt;I have a 63 Panel that has either a 15 or 1600 single port head with a
&gt;28 PICT 6V choke (voltage dropped from 12V).

You might measure the voltage at the choke heater terminal with the
engine running and revved up a little.  If it's really low (say, much
below 5 V), the choke could take a long time to come open.

The way I adjust a choke is to let the Bus sit all night in the
&quot;average&quot; seasonal temperature, then before starting it, adjust the
choke heater so that the choke plate just barely closes.  Often this
will make the dot on the heater line up with one of the marks on the
carb, but not always - I don't worry about it much if the marks don't
line up.

Also, too much pressure from the fuel pump can force the float valve
open, overfilling the float bowl and flooding the engine.  See pages
K-3 2 and K-3 3 of the '63-'67 Bentley.

Later:
&gt; As far as the jet size, your guess is as good as mine.

The numbers should be stamped on all the jets.  If they aren't stamped,
you can get in the ball park with a &quot;jet gauge&quot; set - like feeler gauges
but with different diameters of wire.  On the other hand, page 7 of the
Solex manual at the doc project http://www.failsure_dot_net/oacdp/ claims
that some Solex jets are marked by flow capacity and not bore size,
so measuring the bore is not always accurate.

&gt; Choke is brand new.

I'm guessing you mean the choke heater element?  &quot;Brand new&quot; doesn't
guarantee &quot;works right&quot;.  A 6 V heater element should be about 5 ohms -
much higher and it will open slowly or not at all.  To check, pull off
the wire and measure between the terminal and ground.
