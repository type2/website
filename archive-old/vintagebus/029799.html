The only problem I have with that is that VW is persecuting the very people
who are celebrating the marque by prosecuting them. Why are they pursuing
this so vigorously? I would be willing to bet it's their lawyers out there
trying to create as many billable hours as they can. Most of the time, when I
find lawyers getting blamed for things, they usually deserve it, and more.

&gt; &lt;  it looks like indeed, the lawyers possibly
&gt; won again.&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Please . . . don't blame it on the lawyers. They have no choice. It is
&gt; the law itself and the interpretation of that law by the courts.
