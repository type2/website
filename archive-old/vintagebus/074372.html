Subject: RE: [VB] wives/busses

I hear that. A couple of years ago when I was looking for my new daily driver
I showed my wife the pic of my SC in the truck trader mag. She couldn't
believe I was even considering it as a daily driver, a hobby car maybe,
despite the garage full of dub engines. Now, two years later, nobody I know
can think of me driving up in anything else. The SC is me, and I like it that
way. 'cept when I'm on the trike!

In 1992 when I asked my wife to go with me to look at a 1963 double cab I
had found she went, but when we got there I pulled up and shined the lights
on it ( it was in a barn lot ) She said, &quot; You want to buy THAT? That is the
ugliest damn thing I have ever seen.&quot; I bought it any way and drove it home.
We later took 2 different trips to Calif. ( We live in Arkansas ) One of
those trips we went to Baja Ca. and spent 10 days on the beach. Ol' Ugly has
become a member of this family.
