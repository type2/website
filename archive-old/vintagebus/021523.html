&lt;&lt; I have a 63 and a 62 for parts.  I think I need another tranny in my 67.  
Will either of these trannies fit in my 67? &gt;&gt;
Hi Boyd,
They will fit.  Though you might have to drill the front trans mount bolt 
holes in the nose cone bigger on the 62.  The main problems will be wether 
they are good trannies, or even geared anywhere near correctly.   Eric&amp;Barb
