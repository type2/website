Subject: [VB] re: April Fools at the Expense of General Motors...

There is a local ACVW that I am looking at. It is priced half way reasonable.


Yeah, curiously enough the &quot;commercials&quot; that my friends created and sent to me
still seem to be working. Perhaps GM gleaned out the contest entrants who used
bogus email addresses, bogie snail addresses, included racial slurs and dropped
the F bomb without warning folks. Doh! sorry about that.

I can't seem to make it work either. Perhaps it is selective &quot;system
maintenance&quot; by GM. Pmails to ellisjames at yahoo dot com might work for
off-list communication. Let us return to VW content and civility.

Appologies for the lack of F warning and slur. As the first ever anglo member
of the Boeing Black Employees Assn. (PR committee chairperson). and an
ex-husband to a Yaqui with full D's and a crank habit, I am thoroughly versed
in &quot;Diversity&quot;. (past lives, past lives, past lives, we dont talk about past
lives)...

Inclusion of knee-jerk target words were intentional for reactionary impact. I
was taught that every good ad calls for a response. Hopefully the resulting
&quot;response&quot; will not have the name brand of Molotov, S&amp;W, ATK, or Glock.
