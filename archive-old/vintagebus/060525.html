Subject: RE: [VB] Middle seat question

Gang:

So, looking at the web, I see something like this:

http://www.wolfsburgwest_dot_com/cgi-bin/wwshowpn.cgi?PN=221801419

Does that mean that the new metal floors, don't come with seat brackets
welded in?  I am curious who has done this type of fix and can provide info.


-Wayne

PS Not like I have any back sees for a early model (or can find any) for
that matter.

...The last thing we want to do is drill a hole through the
floor and bolt them that way...
