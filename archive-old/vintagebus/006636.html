  What good is the seat without the slider and the correct bulkhead pieces?
I cut up a 59 Kombi swivel seat a few tears ago and sold the seat with the
tracks , bulkhead pieces and the M code plat for a lot less then E bay
thingy and mine was complete with all necessary pieces to install.

That's the seat for a bus equipped with an M199 swivel walkt-thru.
Not exactly rarest of the rare.
