Subject: [VB] 6V vs 12V

 Well, being an avid all around Car nut (primarily VW, but I do wander
 occasionally), I talk to a lot of old car people.  Now I've always
converted
 my VW's to 12v for convenience because no one can argue that 12v parts are
 easier to get, and the headlights are way brighter. Now, I do know of some
 people with non VW's that have 6v cars.  They all run 8v batteries in their
 6v cars with no problems ever.  They said their headlights are brighter,
and
 everything works fine.  This may be an option for all of the 6v guys out
 there.

 Just an idea
