Subject: Re: [VB] safari windows

The originals have a V-channel with a double-wall inside, although
CE is making some like that now, but I think they're aluminum (aluminium)
The cheep repros have a flat-bottom frame.

&gt;        Pardon my ignorance,  but how can you tell original safari windows from aftermarket ones?  Could I get a general price on original and aftermarket one's as I have a pair that I am going to sell... they are in good condition.
