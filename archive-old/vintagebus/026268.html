&gt; Does anyone know what color hubcaps would be on a 66 Crewcab?  Chrome,
&gt; primer, or other?  I am thinking it would not be chrome, just because

Paul,
According to the splitscreen Specifications, Modifications &amp; Optional
Extras book by David Eccles and Alex Ellis, put out by NEATO and
Brittish Split Screen Van (sic) Club:

Hubcaps that were not chrome were painted light grey, (L345).  Chrome
hubcaps were an option (M181) except on Sambas (deluxes), where they
were standard.
