Nobody has yet to take up Bill Jacobsen on his bus. It's a *GREAT* project
bus and I posted a full synopsis of it's condition several months ago.  In
short, the battery corner has been replaced, the bus has corner glass but no
sunroof or roof glass.  Has the bullet shape turn signals and all seats are
there.  They've been professionally reupholstored in red/brown vinyl
and the middle seat is a 1/3 - 2/3 combo.  Driver's side floor will need to
be replaced and if you can stand the 3 colors of paint (including primer),
all it needs is an engine and the brakes bled and checked before it is
driven.  He has the engine in pieces for it as well as the radio block off
plate.  Bill lives in Hiawatha, KS and his number is:

1-785-742-3667

Tell him that Erin Lassley from Beatrice sent ya.  Reason for selling?
Gonna move in a year or so and needs to get stuff off the lot.  The bus is
kept in an open carport looking thing.  For $500, if I had the room I'd buy
it pronto.

Don't mail me - call Bill. The maching will probably answer but leave a
message and number - so far, Bill has returned 100% of my calls - he's good
VW fodder.

BTW:  I just found my original message so here it is as it appeared back in
March.

Hello Volks.  I'm here to tell you about my trip Saturday March 21st from
Beatrice, NE to Hiawatha, KS to check on a 59 bus and the biggest parts
stash I have found yet.

First off, I must say that since Mr.Vw showed up a week ago Thursday, the
Westy has ran like it never has before.  I think that Mr.Vw's presense did
something to the Westy. :-)  I was actually accelerating ever so slightly up
hills that used to drag me down!  When I stop to check the engine, it's nice
a cool - fixing my thermostat problem has done wonders!

Here's the story:

My trusty sidekick Erik Weakland and his friend Jack wanted to go along.
They are both just under the driving age of 16 here and are dying to drive
anything.  They are the pickup truck/v8 type of kids but I went through that
stage myself once!  They love riding in the VWs though and besides being
good help, they kept me company on the way over.

We arrived in Hiawatha, KS which is about 90 miles from here.  We
accidentally drove past Bill Jacobsen's house once but once we settled in
and knew where we were, we rolled into the driveway, popped the top up on
the Westy, notified the Mrs. we were there so she could summon Bill home
from his rental project, and kicked back and waited.

After greetings were swapped, he showed me the bus.  He said &quot;rust free&quot; on
the phone and of course this wasn't the case but the bus does have minimal
rust.  It has less than my 66 bus does and for a 59 bus that is 39 years
old, it ain't really too bad.  It sits under a carport protected from rain,
direct sunlight, etc.  There is also a fiberglass buggy on a shortened pan
that is a junker but I would dearly love to have it.  It's &quot;part of the
whole&quot; as he says.  What I gather is that he wants to clear out everything
by August or September of this year.

Here is a 360 degree walk around view of what I observed of the 59 bus
starting with the RR corner and proceeding counter clockwise around the
whole bus.
&gt;---
RR tail light and lense small round type with glass lense.  Good shape.
Corner has been replaced due to battery rust.  As bus sits in primer right
now, scrape marks a visible through the paint from filing down the welds but
little bondo would take care of this.  Notice that this is a deluxe bus with
rear jailbars and corner glass - no top glass or sunroof.  Has popouts on
the sides.  Out side of frames is primer gray where as insides of frams are
an aqua green control.  Cargo doors - one with handle opens but shuts a
little tough.  Partner cargo door stuck shut due to rusty hinges.  All seats
present - front bench, middle 1/3 - 2/3 seat (flop down 1/3), and rear
seat - all redone and in nice shape with a reddish brown vinyl (looks
vintage bus isn't).  Notice on floor the following:

-Aftermarket moon hubcaps with no VW logo - these aren't with the deal -
he's got original caps in the shop
- 2 heater boxes
- rusted bows for the missing headliner
-beauty rings (not with the deal)
-front VW emblem
-boxes of misc parts (like points, dizzy's, nuts, bolts, etc.)

After shutting cargo doors, opened front passenger door.  Glass is so dirty,
appears foggy.  Track for the sliding glass window is rusty and would
probably need replaced.  Front glass is cracked.  Get impression that this
bus could use all new glass up front but back corners, hatch, and rear most
pop-outs okay.

Opened passenger door, lift floormat.  Floor is rusted through.  Still
structurally sound but looks like a cobweb of rust holes primarily right
where you would put your feet.  Noticed dash clock missing. Front has bullet
style turn signals both lenses there.  No deluxe trim noticed.  Both front
doors have the pull handle - no bush button entry.  Driver's side door
opened.  Gear shift knob is a red looking sphere of plastic.  Appears to
have beetle speedo installed.  Owner states he installed speedo with fuel
guage and cut hole in gas tank and installed a sender unit.  Said prior to
this, used lever that ran to back to dump spare gallon of gas into tank.
Aftermarket radio installed - queried owner and bus was converted to 12v.
The dash was cut slightly but stereo being installed but says he has block
of plate that will &quot;cover it up.&quot;
Steering wheel loose - robbed nut off to fix other bus for a customer.  Horn
button and spring still on front bench seat.  Notice rust under floor mat on
driver's side just like passenger side but this side has a big 12&quot; by 12&quot;
galvanized patch screwed down over the biggest hole.  Looks like where ones
feet is where it's the worst.  Underneath the bus looks solid but just
surface rust all over everything.  Steering box all wet (leaking).  Could
use front end rebuilt and a bottom media blasting with POR-15 treatment.
Notice interior front is done in a nice smooth factory looking reddish brown
paint.  Unsure if this is factory or not.  Not sure at all what factory bus
color is.  Owner also states at this time that the rails that stand up on
the &quot;back of the back seat have been snapped off.&quot;  Assume it's part of the
jailbar system but unsure.  Notice also that front headlights, chrome rings,
and glass covers appear in real good shape - almost brand new.  Can't detect
bondo in front end - looks undented and factory.  Front bumper is there
(looks like the flat blade style).  Proceeded to rear of bus, notice LR
bezel glass is broken and split in a jillion pieces.  Engine bay, though
dirty, appears solid.  Gas tank in plain view, no engine, obvious cutting
torch job done to clearance engine bay for later model heater boxes.

Floor is solid for the center and rear bench seat areas but did notice pin
hole in front of middle bench seat on floor and with parts on floor,
couldn't see on floor behind driver's seat.  PO said that is where there is
rust through and I believe him because this is where the rust on my 66 bus
is the worst.
Also notice that along roof on the right side that there are snaps screwed
into roof along the length of the whole bus about 8 inches apart.  It was
like this when the guy rescued the bus from the junkyard and it is supposed
someone put them on there to attatch a tarp for a tent on the side.  They
were just sighted on so they aren't in a real straight longitudinal line.
Didn't see spare tire anyplace but all rims are 5 lug with pretty big tires
on them.  Didn't check tire condition.  Assumed that it need to be replaced.

Asked price for bus.  Will sell seperately from rest of parts stash for $500
as long as you will restore and promise not to resell for profit. He wants
to see it go to a good home.

Feeling of this bus:  Definitely a restoration type of project but a real
solid
and complete basis for one.  Have never seen an old bus with this little
rust and this complete ever.  I must say there was rust around the front
glass and front interior panels are gone (you can see the wiring and
headlight buckets).
If I didn't have the 66, I'd probably opt for this bus as the
corner-glass-59 Deluxe is a nice foundation for a nice project.  The area
under the cargo doors appears solid too - this is another bad place on my
66.
&gt;----
Moving on, he showed me a nice 64 bug pan, the junkylookingbutpotentiallyfun
fiberglas buggy (which I'd love to have!), swingaxle trannies, and other
stuff that is unfortunately outside sitting on the ground. :-(  He took me
into the shop and showed me:

Engine cases galore (at least 10 to 15 which are good rebuilders) - he
hasn't saved &quot;junk cases&quot; as he put it.  A baja kit (minus one fender), 1 or
2 rear fenders from an early 70's bug (with those side reflectors), new
mufflers (still in primer), new and good used heater boxes, 36hp engine, the
original bastard engine in pieces for the 59 bus, new pistons and cylinders
for a 1200 rebuild (taken as trade-in for some work done on a dub), some
type 3 engine tin, type 1 engine tin - the likes I have never seen before,
10 to 20 carbs that look all like 30-pict to 34-pict, boxes of new parts
with old SCAT logos on them (very 70ish looking), new gaskets, aftermarket
flull flow oil stuff new in old SCAT packs, alternators, generators, wheel
adaptors, flywheels, shrouds, just everything - mainly engine stuff.

He wants $1000 for everything he showed me.  There was yet another shed of
parts that was partially blocked with some junk and he said that was also
full of parts as well.  If I had the money and the room, I'd take it all.
He told me if he sells the bus for $500 (with all the bus parts that go with
it), then he'll sell the rest of his stash for $500.

My personal feelings on all of this is that several people would probably
benefit by chipping in together, hauling it all off, and then divvying it
all up so not one person would be stuck with the whole bill of it all.  I'm
mainly interested in the buggy myself but it's part of the deal and I got
the impression that he wouldn't sell it seperate.

After more visiting, I showed him the Westy, added a half quart of oil,
noticed that the plug on the 34-pict carb had worked loose to I tapped it
back in and kind of used a screwdriver and ratchet booger up the metal
around the plug to hold it in.  I'll get me some JBWeld today and take care
of that. :-)

We made the trip home in about 2.5 hours.  We stopped and ate at Burger King
in Falls City, NE and happened across one of those discount tool vendors
(the ones with old plywood and sawhorses for display racks) and picked up a
nice set of snap ring pliers and a combination air pressure guage/inflator.
All you gotta go is pull the lever to fill yer tire and then let go to read
the pressure.  I spent $22 bucks total - not a bad deal.  I wished I had the
money for the 3/4 drive sockets set with SAE sockets that would work on bug
and bus axle nuts.  It also came with 3&quot; and 6&quot; extensions, ratchet and
breaker bar all for $65.  Despite the bold black print bragging of it's
oriental heritage, it was tempting none-the-less.

We got home after dark and I bought the boys' a chocolate mint shake at the
local greasy spoon where the folks told me they would be (cell phones and
buses go good together.) :-)

It was a nice trip over all.

If any of you have any questions about any of what I have written, please
ask me cuz I know I've probably left out some stuff.  If anyone would like
to buy into this stash, you've got free room and board here at the Lassley's
and I'll take vacation to help you out as well.  I think at this time, I'm
going to pass as I need to put my funds towards getting my 66 roadworthy
asap.

Thanks for reading...
