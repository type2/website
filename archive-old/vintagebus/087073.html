Subject: timing mark jumping around

I've developed a problem with my 67 Westy, 1600 DP engine w/PICT34-3 and 205M distributor.  It started backfiring shortly after I tuned it up the last time and after tracing back through the things I had done I came to conclusion it was the distributor.  I put a timing light on it and the timing mark was jumping all over the place at 3000rpm.  I have since improved the performance by reinstalling the distributor and this time making sure I had it seated all the way down, touching the clamp firmly.  The performance is holding steady now but the timing mark is still jumping around within plus or minus 3/4 of an inch.  I now think the distributor is the main cause.  Can someone suggest how to remedy this problem?  Do I need to replace the whole distributor? 

thanks 

John
67 Westy
