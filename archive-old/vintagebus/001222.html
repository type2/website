&gt;#4--brand new case,, It has been machined for bigger jugs,,  I usually
&gt;have my used cases professionally cleaned but have been told I can clean
&gt;it myself.  What cleaning fluids have you guys had good luck with ?

I remember this guy who had a Peterbuilt with aluminum wheels. He used to
use some kind of acid to clean them, but you had to be very careful with it.
Anyone know about cleaning aluminum with acid? How about cleaning magnesium?

Thanks,
Kevin Sullivan
