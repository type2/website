Subject:  [VB] Dumb fuel POLL

ok kids, TIME FOR A POLL. how many of you have personally had a &quot;little
plastic fuel filter&quot; come apart and douse your engine.  PLEASE P-MAIL ME.
I'LL GIVE IT A WEEK AND REPORT MY FINDINGS.  i sold 1000's of these of all
kinds of manufacture, and have used 100's personally, and never had one
come apart, nor someone complain about it.  the only person who said this
happened to him was ed, neato pres (why didn't you vote), but he has his
own consipracy theory on that one.

&gt; Those little plastic filters between the pump and carb aren't all that
&gt; good of an idea.  They can break and douse the sparking bits of your
&gt; engine with gas.  They aren't all that good of filters anyway.
