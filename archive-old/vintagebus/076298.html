Subject: windshield leak

My '61 Panel leaks at the outboard corners on the left and right windshields.
I had them removed by a local glass company. The seals were replaced and the
glass reinstalled with sealant. The leak is not as bad, but in even light rain
there is a steady drip, drip, drip. The glass company said that the
windshields are not original and the current ones weren't properly cut and
fitted. I won't be able to remove them again without breakage ( I believe). I
know this is a common problem, does anyone have a fix?
