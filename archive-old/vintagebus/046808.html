Subject: Re: [VB] Dead mouse removal?

it is pretty fresh if you can still smell it.  My cat is an accomplished 
hunter handily killing the vermin, and I often find dead rodents or parts 
thereof or one in process of becoming dead or being eaten, near my bed in the 
morning.  So I look where I walk, and shake out my boots,   and can supply 
you with new rodents if you like.  I was keeping them for a friend who was in 
a biology class (that was a Townsends' Vole, but those arent the current 
crop).  And they also fed a snake.  

Anyway  I had an enormous cleaning fit yesterday, and there was a dried 
rodent found behind some furniture.  They (mummified version) are 
periodically found,  BUT I have never smelt rotting mouse in the house.  who 
knows?

I also had a live mouse living in my bug for a while, under the back seat- or 
over the tranny- it would run along the starter cable from the battery under 
the back seat to the starter area at least.    

Good luck finding the little beggar.  FWIW they will blow out of the bus 
fresh air vents (65 style foot vents) when dried.
