Hi Craig,
More likely to be DPO mods.  We have dealt with 25, 36, 40 HP, 1500, &amp; 1600 
thermostatic flaps and the rod is the same length and bends.  The only 
differance is the non-fresh air rods have a stamped set of tiny ears on the 
top end to lock into the pivot arm of the preheat ring Vs. the fresh air rods 
that are left smooth and are speed nutted to the right side flaps.
