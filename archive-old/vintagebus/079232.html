Subject: Re: [VB] under pedal spash pans - how many kinds?

   There is another I don't see pictured. I have 4 different ones, not counting BD (I don't know how many of if there are 
different ones) and the 3 different bay window ones.

I might be wrong on the dates and am sure someone will come in and correct me

55 to 57
58 to 62
63 to 66
67 only

The dates are only guesstimates

&gt;I was looking at the samba and saw this ad... it has pictures of 3 versions 
&gt;of the 3/55-67 pedal pan.  I thought there were two versions.     Anyway, the 
&gt;pics are nice and clear showing the differences, so anyone who cares about this 
&gt;trivia take a look.
