When I attempted to look at the new VW's at the local dealer I was 
asked  &quot;Do you REALLY think you can afford a VW&quot; (in a very condescending 
tone). Then the salesman refused to unlock any of the cars. That and he 
commented on the &quot;Crappy&quot; appearance of my &quot;61 Singlecab...he didn't 
believe that someone would hack up a bus to make a pick-up. Needless to say 
I will never give that dealership any business or referrals.
