:  I got 5 lbs of dry ice for $10 u.s.  and it came in an insulated paper
:  bag...

This price seems high to me....

:  I put the bag of ice in a cooler with a 30 / 70 partition, and put the beer
:  and the soda on the bigger side of the partition, separated from the bag by
:  air and a plastic divider.
:  I didn't put any regular ice in

That would definitely be a mistake.  The other things in the cooler
don't have nearly as a good a &quot;heat inertia&quot; as water does.  Putting
water ice on top of the dry ice will do two things:  you get an
insulating layer so the rest of the cooler isn't at -50 or so, and
both ices will melt more slowly (particularly in the face of repeated
openings of the cooler, which you should, of course, keep to a
minimum).

:  It did last longer than reg ice,, as I had it from Thurs afternoon till
:  about sat afternoon,
:  but I guess this depends on alot of factors,, and EveryBus wasn't the
:  Hottest weeekend to test its endurance.

On a really hot outing, two days is about what I'd expect from that
sort of setup (although with more like a 50/50 split of ice/food
volume).  If it's not excessively hot, you should be able to do three+
days without too much effort.  In other words, keep the cooler covered
and in the shade, things like that.  Nothing's going to much help a
cooler that's open all the time and/or in direct sunlight with the
temperatures about 80 Fahrenheit.
