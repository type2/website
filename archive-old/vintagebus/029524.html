Subject: Re: [VB] Why won't my bus accelerate?

I had a '71 westy with a problem similar to this, once. I bought and
installed new plugs, points, condensor, coil, changed the carb... Turned
out to be a clogged air filter (about 5 bucks to replace)... Maybe, try
taking your air filter off and see if it accelerates any  better.

Other suggestions... Make sure your fuel pump is working. Does your
clear plastic fuel filter have gas in it? You could pull the fuel line
from the carb, have someone crank the engine over and see if you're
getting anything from the pump... Spray some brake cleaner around your
carb/intake connection, around the intake boots, then around where the
intake is bolted to the heads, to check for vacuum leaks...

Check your points, just make sure they're not closed up or stuck
together... make sure your timing is ok...

Lastly, I had a Fiat Spyder that did what you have described. Turned out
that the float valve had unscrewed itself from the carb, and wouldn't
let enough gas into the bowl to keep the car going.
