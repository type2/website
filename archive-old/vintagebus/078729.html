You might be on to something here. Whatever is the most sound deadening
seems like it would be well worth the try. What does the torch down material
look like? Does it come in sheets, roll roofing? Can you send some pictures?
Dave

I was thinking of using
&gt; roofing torch down material (used on flat roofed buildings). I figure I
&gt; would literly torch it down the same way before installing the new
&gt; floors.
