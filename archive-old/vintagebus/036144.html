Hi Dan,
When using new P&amp;Cs , and heads the engine is just going to run hot for a 
while till the parts seat completely in properly in 3,000 to 6,000 miles.  
This is why it is best to run it around town for the first 300-500 miles 
especially in stop and go traffic for trips about 15 to 30 minutes with shut 
downs of at least 15 minutes between to allow it to cool down.  We would 
suggest getting a doghouse cooler setup to pamper your #3 cylinder and have 
less problems there down the road.  Eric&amp;Barb
