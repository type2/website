Subject: re;emblems,  the hippy bus(sorry if 2 post)
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

  in my opinion the chrome repops are junk
the inner corners are way off, the bends aren't crisp and the metal is thin, but what do you expect from overseas (orient). especially the chrome, scratchs under chrome etc, but hey call and deal you can probably bargin and get-em for 20 bucks a piece (ps plus they don't fit worth a da##.

   WCM are pretty close, at JEROME i had an org.
chrome, an orig. painted and an WCM repop hanging together and people had a hard time telling them apart, the wing nuts gave it away, but them having a 2/3 off sale i haven't heard about that
i ussally get 35.00 for them sell a lot at that 
but would lower my price if i did get them cheaper
i am a WCM warehouse dist. also EMPI, TMI, JA-MAR
and others.
