&gt; Anyone care to comment ?

I know of at least three examples of Mexican engines living happily in
buses, including my own.  To me, the low-compression Mexican engine seems
to be ideal for the application and I have no complaints.

The main problem in dual-port heads is cracking around the spark plug
holes.  The Mexican heads address this problem by going to long-reach
plugs which allows the metal to be thicker in this area.  I have no idea
if this will prevent cracking or not, but it's a step in the right
direction.

Other problems with dual-port installation is cracking of the cylinder tin
and leaks in the manifold boots.  My 30-year-old tin, once repaired by
brazing, has shown no further tendency to crack.  I still haven't come up
with a good solution for the intake manifold boot problem other than
renewing them every time it is convenient.  The &quot;silicone&quot; boots are
better, but they still crack.  You can change them with the engine in
place by removing the left manifold end piece.
