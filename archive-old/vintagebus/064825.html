Subject: RE: [VB] Crying kids and road trips- what music calms them
  down? 

Let's just say that I used to think of myself as an audiophile. Now I just
stuff pistol shooter's earplugs in my ears, full (ear) coverage headphones and
crank up unusually rowdy music to cover the incessant screaming and crying.
Brokaw comes on at 5:30 in Phoenix. All can be well with the world at 5:15.
Play that NBC Evening News theme music and everyone in the house starts to
scream, cry, deficate, puke, turn red in the face and beg for attn. 6:03 PM and
all goes quiet again... My left~ turn signal for a TiVo.
Everett, are you still up for babysitting Saturday night? ;-) I owe you a phone
call none the less.
