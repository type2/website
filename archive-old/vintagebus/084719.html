Subject: Etka parts list

Howdy Volks!

Has anyone seen on-line the Volkswagen ETKA parts list that the dealerships
use to show diagrams and VW part numbers for air cooleds?  I found a site
that had the ETKA for a 1990 Passat, but that's doesn't really do us any
good, unless you have a Passat of course...
Thanks
