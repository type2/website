Subject: Truck show class

&gt;Well, now I'm really upset! My 63 double cab is a factory 12 volt. It is a
&gt;TRUCK, not a bus but when I go to a show, do they have a class for TRUCKS ?
&gt;
&gt;No, they put me in a class with 300 BUSSES and I don't never win nothing.
&gt;whimper, whimper, whine.

Be happy with your truck and get use to getting passed over! Commercials are 
usually lumped in with everything else. Good luck getting a trophy when your truck is competing against a 23 window barndoor (or even post BD for that matter) for votes, no matter if it is a much better resto. I doubt even David Mayes truck could pull off a win (when finished) which is a real shame. Everyone knows commercials are the coolest *ducks for cover*

 ooooooohhhhhhhh chrome! .....what a bunch of sheep.
