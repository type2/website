Subject: ZebraSafari and vintage buses in Africa

Hey Volks

I'm finally back with my feet on home ground after driving nine-and-a-half
months and 32,000km across Africa, the Middle East and Europe in the
ZebraBus.

What follows is a brief account of the vintage VWs we spotted along the way.

For those who don't know the ZebraBus, she is a 1975 splitscreen 15-window
Kombi, made in Brazil and assembled in South Africa, and sold under the
model name &quot;Fleetline&quot;. There's more info about her at:
www.zebrasafari.co.za

We began our journey on July 22 2001, when we left Johannesburg heading
south instead of north, because we wanted to start at Cape Agulhas, the
southernmost point of Africa.

Although we drove nearly 5,000km around South Africa in the first few weeks
of our trip, we only saw one other splitscreen bus. Shortly before we left
Cape Town we took a scenic drive up Table Mountain. At the end of the road
we spotted another 1975 Fleetline just like our ZebraBus, and we waved at
the young couple inside. As we headed back down the mountain I noticed the
other Fleetline following behind us, and we drove down the mountain in
convoy, before parting company at the bottom with a hoot and a wave. We had
to drive more than 16,000km (10,000 miles) across the continent before we
saw another splittie.

One day driving in Cape Town we spotted a wonderful 1967 Beetle that had
been painted up to resemble Janis Joplin's Porsche 356, in memory of Janis
and the 1969 Woodstock festival. We gave chase and got the driver to pull
over, much to his surprise. He was an ageing hippie who had attended
Woodstock, which seemed to have been the defining moment of his life.

After leaving South Africa we crossed Namibia. The harsh driving conditions
there have ensured that very few air-cooled VWs have survived. We saw a
couple of Beetles and baywindow buses from the 1970s in the capital,
Windhoek, but nothing from pre-1967.

The next country we entered was Botswana, where 90% of the vehicles on the
road seem to be newish 4x4s of one sort or another. In the town of Maun,
adjoining the Okavango Delta, the ZebraBus was spotted by two different
German-speaking
men who told me they had driven Bullis from Germany to Cape Town in the
1960s and 1970s.

The first guy, an architect from Vienna who was in Africa on safari,
couldn't believe his eyes when he saw our bus. Although he spoke little
English he accosted me in a parking lot and told me all about how he drove a
Bulli across Africa in the 1960s.

The very next day I met another German fellow, who was a mechanic at one of
the safari camps in the Delta. He said he had driven a Bulli from Germany to
Cape Town in 1973. Among his spare parts he carried a complete engine(!!!).
But his bus did not break down and he sold the engine at the end of the
journey.

He described how he crossed the Sahara Desert by using two 30m-long rolls of
wire mesh to get the bus across soft, sandy stretches. He also told me that
his bus did the trip with more than 300kg of stuff on the roofrack with no
ill effects (VW specifies a maximum roof weight for the bus of 100kg). The
ZebraBus's own rack was carrying more than 200kg when we had a full load of
fuel on board.

After Botswana we crossed Zambia, Malawi, Tanzania and Kenya without seeing
a single splitscreen bus, not even a scrap one.

In Tanzania, in the towns of Moshi and Arusha, we saw a lot of Beetles, but
most were 70s models, although we did spot a few 60s Bugs. I also met the
secretary of the Arusha Beetle Club. It came as a big surprise to me to find
a club there, as all the Beetles still on the roads are kept going by hook
and by crook, and most of them are in a pretty sad condition by now.

My grandfather and my father came from the area around Arusha, and I was
surprised to learn during this time that my grandfather previously owned the
Volkswagen agent in Arusha, Townsend's Limited, during the 1950s. That was
news to me! No wonder I love old VW buses!

Not only did we see no vintage buses between Cape Town and the equator, but
most of the local people who commented on the ZebraBus asked us what she
was, and many even asked if she was new! It's obviously many many years
since splitties last drove the roads of East Africa, and they are now all
but forgotten.

I was beginning to think we wouldn't see any splitties on the continent,
until we reached Ethiopia. In the rural areas and villages of Ethiopia there
are very few private cars; most of the people make do with donkeys. Almost
the only vehicles on the roads are trucks and the ubiquitous Japanese
minibuses, which are used as taxis everywhere across Africa.

But, when we reached the capital, Addis Ababa, we found old VWs everywhere.
Most of the cars in Addis date from the 50s, 60s and 70s, and I saw
splitscreen buses every day we drove in Addis. There were hundreds of
Beetles on the roads of Addis, more from the 60s than from the 70s, and I
saw several oval-window Bugs being driven.

The splitties in Addis were German and Brazilian models. I photographed one
Brazilian bus that was in service as a hearse. And I also got a good
sighting of a unique Brazilian bus that I had never seen, but had heard
rumours about: the Brazilian taxi. Taxi versions of the Brazilian
splitscreen buses were very weird beasts indeed. Apart from the front doors,
they have two passenger doors on each side of the bus but, instead of a
facing pair like the normal cargo doors, all the rear doors in the Brazilian
taxis are forward hinged/rear opening, with a wide pillar between them, so
that passengers have easy access to both rear bench seats from both sides of
the bus. Look out for pics of this one on the website as soon as I can scan
the photos.

Our next surprise in Addis came when we found the local Volkswagen dealer,
which looked just like a VW dealer from the 60s, with 60s-style signage and
lots of old Beetles and buses parked in the yard. In what passed for a
showroom was a brand new Brazilian panelvan. It's basically a Type1-engined
baywindow with a modified roofline. Badging and steering wheel were
modernised, but otherwise the latest Brazilian bus looks like a German bus
from ca1971.

Although we spotted many vintage VWs in Addis Ababa, almost all of them were
very much the worse for wear. In most African countries, new cars are way
beyond the reach of ordinary people, so old cars are kept running in any way
possible. With original parts impossible to find, drivers make whatever
modifications are necessary to keep their cars going with whatever parts
they can get.

In one example of this kind of creative bush engineering, I saw a 1971
baywindow bus that had splitscreen hinged cargo doors fitted in place of the
sliding door, whose mechanism had presumably been broken beyond repair. The
splitty doors were exactly the correct width, but were about 20cm too short
at the bottom. Another interesting bush modification on this bus was the
Toyota alternator, which was mounted to a bracket on top of the gutted VW
generator, which now served merely as a drive shaft for the cooling fan. A
longer fan belt was fitted, which drove both the alternator and the cooling
fan (via the pulley of the gutted generator).

In Addis at least people recognised the ZebraBus for what she is. But they
had a very low opinion of the VW bus's capabilities, and most people who
spoke to me about the bus said: &quot;But it's a city car -- you can't drive it
in Ethiopia.&quot; They were always very surprised to hear we had driven all the
way from Cape Town and intended to get as far as Cairo.

Once we left Addis and headed north, it was back to donkeys and Japanese
minibuses and overloaded trucks, until we reached the medieval city of
Gondar in the north of the country, where I spotted a very tired late 50s
bus serving as school transport.

About 50km out of Gondar the ZebraBus's cooling fan cracked around the hub,
our first mechanical failure of the journey. Luckily the fan was still
turning, so we were able to turn back to Gondar to effect a repair.

While scouting the scapyards of Gondar searching for a replacement fan, I
came across two barndoor buses. One of them had been hacked into a pick-up,
but the other looked to me like a restorable proposition, despite not having
engine, transmission or front suspension. There were lots of scavengeable
parts on the two buses, including a set of barndoor safari screens, steering
wheels and a good &quot;upside down&quot; speedo, but the scrapyard owner would not
sell me any parts off them, as he said an English traveller had bought them
both some months previously.

I was unable to find the correct wide fan in Gondar, so I eventually had the
cracked fan welded up. I had removed the alternator and fan with the engine
still in the car, but my attempt at saving time backfired when I
accidentally dropped a washer into the manifold without noticing when I
removed the carb. When I reassembled everything and fired the engine up
again, it made a horrific ringing sound. I had to pull the engine and remove
the LHS cylinder head to remove the washer from #3 cylinder. There was no
damage to the piston or head, but the washer had been rolled up into
something resembling a small nail.

After Ethiopia we entered Sudan. Ours was the only air-cooled VW anywhere in
the desert. We did see a couple of Brazilian bay/split hybrids in Khartoum.

In the far north of Sudan, in Wadi Halfa, I spotted a very interesting bus
clone. It was a 1963 Volga, a Russian-made minibus with four-wheel drive. It
looked similar to a British Commer minibus from the same era, with a
four-wheel drive set-up that looked as though it was modelled on the
drivetrain of an early Land Rover. Although it was literally held together
with wire, I took some photographs of this bus which will soon be posted on
our site. I spotted another of these interesting vehicles in Egypt, in very
good condition, but it was a military vehicle and they would not let me
photograph it. I also spotted lots of these Volga 4x4 minibuses in Bulgaria.

Egypt was also pretty much bereft of ACVWs until we reached Cairo, where
there are lots of decrepit Beetles still running. But Cairo did have one
quirky surprise up its sleeve: the Pyramids road in Giza is plied by a fleet
of 70s baywindow taxis, many of them still in good condition. For some weird
reason that I was unable to discover, only that route features VW buses as
taxis, and everywhere else in Egypt you are unlikely to see old VW buses at
all. We did spot one splitscreen bus in Egypt, also in Giza. It was a crusty
old 64-67 German bus with a single safari windscreen.

Our next major bus sighting came in Syria, where baywindow buses were
plentiful, although we saw no splits.

In the north of Syria, in a town called Aleppo, the ZebraBus dropped a valve
as we were slowing down for an intersection. I suspect the broken valve was
the aftermath of a load of bad fuel we bought when we left Egypt. Excessive
detonation caused by the poor fuel combined with very hot weather and a long
ascent from sea level to 1,750m in Jordan to terminally damage the engine.

I pulled the engine in a side street in Aleppo and fitted the spare cylinder
head we had been carrying. The valve had broken at low speed, and it seemed
that the piston was undamaged. But in fact the piston must have been
cracked, because it completely disintegrated the next day.

Meanwhile, I reassembled the engine and we hit the road again and crossed
into Turkey. At the border I spotted a splitscreen bus (German 64-67) in a
queue of taxis, but that was the only splittie I saw in Turkey.

Later that day the piston that had hit the broken valve disintegrated in a
remote area of the countryside, all but destroying the engine. We were lucky
to get a tow back to the city of Gaziantep, where we placed ourselves in the
care of the local ACVW expert, Mehmet Yapar.

We stripped the engine and found it filled with a chunky aluminium soup. The
bits of the broken piston had damaged all the other pistons and cylinders,
but luckily there was no serious damage to the case or any of the other
internal parts. But there was no chance of finding any new parts in
Gaziantep. Instead, Mehmet gave me a used P&amp;C set from his carefully hoarded
stash of junk, and we reassembled the engine.

This repair got us on the road again, but the used P&amp;Cs were worn out and
our faithful ZebraBus was never the same again. Power was down and #4 spark
plug kept oiling up, and there was a nasty oil leak. She got really
temperamental after that; some days she ran quite well, while on others she
felt as though she was about to throw a rod.

Nonetheless, our tough old bus limped across Turkey and across Eastern
Europe and into Vienna, where we met up with the Vienna Bulli Club. We met
several of the club members and their Bullis, and gave a slide and video
presentation at their monthly club meeting. The Bulli Club members were
great and we had a fabulous time with them.

I had been planning on doing a proper repair to the ZebraBus in Vienna, but
she had perked up considerably by the time we reached Austria, so I thought
she would hold out until we reached Germany and Frankfurt, where Bullikartei
guru Michael Steinke was waiting to assist us.

That turned out to be a mistake. The day we entered Germany the oil leak
deteriorated into a flood and the engine began running very badly. Then, in
Stuttgart, the autobahn cops pulled us over. They took one look at the
puddle of oil under our bus and took immediate offense at us dirtying up
their clean German roads.

They told us that we had to accompany them to &quot;an engineer&quot;, who would
establish what was wrong with the car. I knew they wanted to take our
beloved bus off the road, and Zebi knew it too. On the way to the engineer
she gave up her long struggle and her heart broke and she dumped all her oil
on the road. But the cops did not fall for that little delaying tactic and
they called a tow truck (at our expense). Zebi was dragged to the testing
station and pushed
through the TUV test.

The TUV test is the German roadworthiness test and it is probably the
strictest roadworthy in the world. Even in her best condition when she had
just passed the South African roadworthy in Johannesburg she would not have
been able to pass the TUV test. And after 30,000km of extreme driving
through Africa and a jury-rigged engine repair in Turkey there was just no
way she was going to survive examination by the TUV technicians in their
white lab coats.

Zebi was found to be unfit to drive in the European Union, and the cops
impounded our license plates and registration papers and left us stranded in
the street on a Friday evening with a warning that if our pile of junk was
still there on Monday morning they would remove it, at our expense, to a
scrapyard.

We called Michael Steinke to let him know that we were taking him up on his
offer to rescue us with a trailer. Michael arrived the next morning with his
T4 Syncro TDi and a car trailer, accompanied by fellow Bullikartei member
Matthias Meyer.

Michael towed us the 250km to Frankfurt and would not allow me to pay for
fuel. On route we dropped Matthias off at his home and got to see his bus, a
1965 Arcomobil, a very rare pop-top camper conversion.

In Frankfurt, Michael and his wife Christa and their dog Samba opened their
home to us. Their kindness was amazing, and it carried us through a
difficult time, as we sold our beloved ZebraBus and disposed of most of our
possessions.

Thanks to Michael, we were able to sell Zebi within 24 hours to a fellow bus
collector. Thomas Gahl's collection features only unique and oddball buses,
and he promised us that he intends to preserve Zebi just as she is. He said
he would repair her engine so that he could drive her to shows (on his
garage plates, so no TUV certificate necessary!), but that he would
otherwise leave her as she is. He also promised us that any time we visit
Germany we are welcome to visit Zebi in his collection.

Once we had sold the ZebraBus, Michael gave me one of the buses from his
collection to drive around in. Anyone who has heard of Michael Steinke will
know that he has a constantly changing collection of the most amazing
splitscreen buses. Michael is not into restoration, and all the buses that
have crossed his hands have been low-mileage originals. He has owned all
sorts of marvellous emergency vehicles and still has an immaculate 1967
Westy Dormobile, a spotless 1966 21-window Samba and a squeaky clean 1967
Standard Microbus.

But to me the star of his collection is his 1967 ex-fire department double
cab, with just 22,000 original kilometres on the odo. And that's the car
that Michael gave me to drive. Just like that! It was a pleasure and a
privilege to drive around for a week in a nearly new vintage bus, and it
gave me a real feel for what splitties felt like when they were new. I still
can't believe that Michael was prepared to hand over the keys to such a
unique and valuable vehicle to a complete stranger! If I had a bus like that
I wouldn't let anyone so much as breathe on it, never mind drive it!

Although it was a very sad end to the ZebraSafari, things were made easier
by the wonderful kindness of the Steinke family and the hospitality of the
Frankfurt Bullikartei members. And we were comfortable in the knowledge that
our beloved Zebi will enjoy a graceful retirement in the hands of someone
who really appreciates her amazing feat.

It is interesting to note that our first breakdown on the journey came after
we had left Africa. We drove 22,000km from Cape Town to Cairo without a
single breakdown! And, what's more, we did it without any punctures or
blow-outs either! Our only mechanical failure from Cape to Cairo was the
cracked cooling fan and a couple of oil leaks, all of which were easily
repaired and did not strand us on the road.

So much for all the party poopers who told us we would never make it!
Vintage VW buses rule!

Drive those buses!
