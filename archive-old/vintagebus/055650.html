Subject: Type 2 list and Delete key

--part1_160.199f37b.28e7404c_boundary

I Delete 90% of Type 2 list mail for lack of bus content.
I'm about out of here if we can't return to Bus content like the list was 
meant for.
Busses are what I want to read about and not all this other shit. Even Friday 
topics should be Bus related.
Please help keep it a type 2 list and use it for what it is.
