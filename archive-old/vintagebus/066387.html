Subject: RE: [VB] Quarterlight seals

  I am getting ready to restore a set of window frames for my 63 Westy.
  I will take pics of the seal install when I do it, also the workmate
wingvent glass press jig.
  I will also be showing the new felts we just had made for the non threw
the glass latches. These will be available in bottom felts only and in
complete kits. 
  These should be here anyday this week.
  Also tired of those replacement mirror arms for the round mirrors? We had
just finished the tooling for these arms, left and right (not fat base)and
are EXACT copies of OG ones and will be available primered only, just like
OG ones.
  Also the first sample of the MOULDED split bus windshield seals are on
their way here, the only problem is they made one side only. After I test
fit these and approve, both sides will be available

Hi Ronnie,

  Since this question has come up many times in the past, and it is one of
the more pita parts of restoration (preservation is better,) and would
help many people actually believe that the heater does work, pls enlighten
us.

 I don't want to cut anything before I find out where to cut, can you or
someone who has done it and knows exactly where to cut...be so kind enough
pass on this vital information?

Best,
joe
