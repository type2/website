I've only adjusted the rear splines on a super beetle so if it's anything
like a bus, it's tricky.  Here's a good point to keep in mind.  When I
adjusted the splines, I found that turning 1 outer spline made a difference
of about an 1/8&quot; of travel in the &quot;at-rest&quot; position.  This equated to a
loaded up suspension that was either all the way bottomed out or all the way
on the top bump stop.  So you are going to be dealing with a slight movement
of about a 1/16&quot; of an inch at rest in order for it to translate into
sufficient (and not overmuch) adjustment when assembled.  I can almost
guarantee that you will have to do inner and outer splines such as I did.
