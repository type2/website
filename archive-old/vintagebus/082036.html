Subject: Re: [VB] pulley stuff w/ freeway flyer

&gt; is anyone aware of a compromise of these two sizes? I wonder what

I was doing a bit of math and it seems that running a power pully w/
the 356 gen pulley will result in about 2:1 ratio. That really seems
ideal, but has anyone run this combination?

I too have a freeway flyer, which is fantastic at 65 on the highway,
however at speed closer to 50-55 the fan just isn't spinning fast
enough for my taste as evidenced by the slightly higher head temps.
Nothing horrible, just working on getting my bus exactly where I want
it for my driving style.
