&lt;&lt;  is there anyway
 to check the RGB, or is it just assumed that if the tranny fluid is
 the correct level, the needed oil for the RGB's make their way to the
 correct level through the axle tubes.

I don't Check the RGBoxes.   Like you said, they are connected by the tubes 
to the center section.   So I look for leaks, inspect the axle boots, and 
check the center section oil level.
