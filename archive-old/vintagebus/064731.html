Subject: Re: [VB] Crewcabs and fences and the CHP

what kind of motor does this have?  Looking through the side door?   Shift 
cable?   Front pulley?   No wonder the poor thing had thoughts of self 
destruction.

&lt;&lt;  Get the crew unloaded this morning and get things
hooked up and fire up the motor. This is throught the crews side door, and I
 see the shift cable is rubbing on the front pully so I go move it and the bus
 jumps in gear and takes off for the next door chain link fence. I panic and
 grab the side door ( instead of just pulling the coil wire) and get dragged
 about 10 feet and let go. The bus plows down the fence  &gt;&gt;
