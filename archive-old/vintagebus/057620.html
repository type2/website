Subject:  [VB] Engine seized

Well,

I was hoping it wasn't seized but it looks like it is.  I don't have the
time or tools to tear it down, can anyone recommend a shop or individual to
tear down and rebuild?  Its an all new 1904 that the PO bought had installed
and never ran it.  I got it started and then it seized up.  I was hopig it
was just high compression and a low battery, but after using a breaker bar
to try to get it to turn...no luck, stuck.

Help,

Charles
