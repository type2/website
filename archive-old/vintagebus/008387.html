The list can be an odd community but I, like you and many others, am glad to
be a part of it through the good times and the bad. We all have the
potential to become frustrated with our situations because we are struggling
to keep a vehicle alive that many before us have given up on. We are
dependent on each other for support of many kinds including parts, advice or
just someone to share our feelings with.

If you are reading this than you are also dependent on the computer as a
channel of communication that helps support your bus habit, hobby, need,
addiction or passion as the case may be. Let's keep in mind that what we
know of each other is often no more than just some carefully crafted ASCII.
It is easy to forget we are not messages but people. I have been fortunate
to meet many listmembers and am always delighted to see and hear who they
really are.

Within the guidelines of the list charter, we are free to post what we as
individuals deem to be meaningful and pertinent. We may also ask the list to
guide us when we are lost. Each individual must make the final decision
whether to turn the wrench themselves or where to trade their money for
parts .This thread has shaken the apples from the tree. You decide which, if
any, you want to pick up.

The lists exist because we need them. When we no longer need them they will
just fade away. The same goes for vendors, buses and even each other. Right
now, I need all three.
