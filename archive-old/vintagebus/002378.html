Subject: Happy B- day Thom, windshield area. fixes

Thoms still a youngin,,grin but happy b-day anyway.  I gained a year last
month so i'm still ahead of him .
On the windshield area's just og ahead and cut it out and fix it rite the
first time.I'm intrigued by leading and someday i might give it a whirl, if
and when i get the time to tinker with it, but i think and i might be wrong
,that  by the time you fool with lead and  the Jb weld  that you can cut it
out and weld in the patch sections, I've been there and did that several
times. I might even know where you could find the fabbed sections to do it
with ,,grin. As for the thick POR putty i don't think so , if anything i
would give the POR 2 part  epoxy a whirl on the area, but you will still
have sanding and smoothing even with that.
Donnin flame suit, just in case the easy way out appeals to others more the
doing it rite the first time does,,later
