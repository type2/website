Subject: BYOB - Weather Obsessive

Okay, so I'll admit it...when I was a kid I wanted to be a TV Weatherman.  I've just come 
from accuweather_dot_com which has forecasts down to the hour.  Guess you have to take it 
with a grain of salt...but here goes....

For BYOB (zip code 95004) they're not predicting rain to start up until about 2pm 
Saturday.  Show's over at 1pm.  :)  Now, I'm not putting 100% faith in all this weather 
stuff, but I want everyone out there to know they shouldn't fear the rain.  Come on out 
and join us for Bring Your Own Bus 2003!!
