THIS IS BAD! especially the popping out. have whoever built it check it or
replace it.  there is NO excuse for any of those problems, especially if
the person rebuilding it knows what they are doing and checked everything
and replaced anything that was worn beyond its service life.  


&gt; [Original Message]
&gt; Some notes on the rebuilt tranny.  Fourth gear howls.  Not as loudly as in
&gt; the Kombi, but it does.  Second gear has a little bite to it until the
oil has
&gt; warmed up some, then it smooths out.  Finally, third gear has popped out
about
&gt; five times in 300 or so miles of driving.  I'm looking for opinions on
what to
&gt; adjust to get around some of these problems (I know 4th gear is just gonna
&gt; howl).  Heck, even some input on what you think about the life of a tranny
&gt; doing this stuff.  This is my first rebuilt, so I don't really know what
I'm
&gt; supposed to expect out of it.  And, no, I've never actually driven one
that
&gt; was perfect either.
