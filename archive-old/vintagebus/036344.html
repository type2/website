Does anyone know when the Berg Cruise is going through Portland? Are you VWHoward planning on coming up with them? I would like to hook up with either or both and need to find out when and where.



Anyone else going to the Vintage meet in Seattle? It would be cool to meet up with listees some place. I will be at the Burger meet, Vintage meet and the Bug Nationals. I will be driving either my Tan colored 60 Double Cab or my 57 23 Window. There is a small chance I will drive the 55 Primer Gray single cab but I am not sure it will be ready for that long of drive.

Come up and say hi!



I hope this post works, my posts only seem to randomly show up.



Hope to see you there,

Craig
