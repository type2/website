When you pull your shifter the locking plate underneeth has a hole in it in a kinda &quot;D&quot; shape with two little walls, one per side.  How does this go in there?  I can't quite figure that one out.  

TIA,
Benj.

P.S.
I am completely sold on POR-15 now.  (except I can't get it out of my hair. . .)
