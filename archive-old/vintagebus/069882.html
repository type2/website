Subject: journey through the past

i was scanning in some OLD hot vws articles tonight (they are going 
to another listee w/ more storage space than i) and was amazed at all 
the lil tidbits contained therein. ferinstanz.... the X on solex jets 
indicates DIRECTION of gas flow!  'X' means the gas flows from the 
jet head to the threads, and should be used in carbs w/ jet 
carriers... no x means thread to head, no carrier. the little circle 
around the jet face means .75 thread pitch; without is .80 and is 
REALLY early.

fun stuff.

course, then there are the advertisement claims, like the one for the 
WHIRR FAN... what looks like the lid from popeye's spinach can stuck 
to the generator pulley! the idea is to cool the engine compartment 
(and remove fingers) by stirring up the air in there because &quot;the 
louvers in your deck lid are for heat to escape, NOT to let air in!&quot; 
in light of our scoops discussion, i thought that was a pretty good 
howler.
