Sorry for the stupid minutia question.  I realize it has nothing to do with keeping a Bus on the road, but it is still nonetheless Bus related.

What was the original color of the cargo door check strap mounting bracket that screws into the cargo door?  Black?  Color of the lower portion of the Bus?  Different for early Westies?  I'm at that point with the Westy and inquiring minds need to know.

TIA.

Robert
