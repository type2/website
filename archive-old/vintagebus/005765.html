&gt; Hi Brad,
&gt; Is your accelerator linkage not going back to the idle postion quickly?
If
&gt; so it might need to be greased, or we have found it works better with both
&gt; the early on throttle cable return spring and the late engine return
spring
&gt; on the carburator at the same time.  Otherwise there was not enough return
&gt; pressure.  Have you been good and applied a drop or two of oil under the
&gt; distributor rotor every time you tune you VW up?  Could be that your
&gt; centrifical wieghts in the distributor are sticking due to lack of
&gt; lubrication.   Eric&amp;Barb

Tried all these things. Linkage seems to check out ok, but i don't think
thats it as i don't even have to press on the gas and it just revs up. I
tried backing off the timing and all I got was an engine that wouldn't
start.  Tightened heat riser bolts, intake manifold, exhaust manifold bolts,
carb is tightened down onto manifold. The only other thing i can think of is
the choke is not adjusted correctly. This doesn't seem likley, as I (with my
limited mechanical knowledge) can't imagine the choke being open at idle to
cause this. It revs, high..i mean, really high, like race car high. I can't
leave it running as I don't want to blow it up. This is really frustrating.
Is there anyplace else to check for vaccuum leaks that im just not finding?
I want to check everything other than the choke first as to adjust choke i
have to take carb off again, and thats getting really nauseating (3-4 times
in almost as many days). Thanks again.
