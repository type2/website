Subject: Correct '67 Westy front seats?
Message-Id: &lt;l03130303631403c16a46_at_[128.0.0.164]&gt;

Last summer I purchased a pretty complete '67 westy.  The interior is nice
and the seats are in good shape for thier age (some tears and sun fading).

My question is, the front seats are covered in the same material as the
rest of the cushions in the bus.  The material is faded and looks to be as
original as the rest.

Did westy ever cover the front seats?  I can't figure out why someone would
want to cover new front seats to match the back, but anything is possible
