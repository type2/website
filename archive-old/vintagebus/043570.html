&gt;The problem is not you. Microsoft is under a DoS attack from hackers.

Crackers.  Or jerks or whatever.  Not hackers.

http://www.tuxedo_dot_org/~esr/jargon/html/Appendix-C.html

Admiral Grace Hopper was one of the first hackers.  Ken Thompson and K&amp;R
are hackers, and are three of the many reasons you can read this right
now.  RMS is a hacker.  Linus is a hacker.

Robert T. Morris was probably a cracker.

Bus content?  Gene Berg and John Muir were VW hackers.  The people
doing the DoS attacks are the people driving around with fake blue
headlights and stacks of washers on each lug bolt as &quot;wheel adapters&quot;.
