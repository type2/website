My alarm awoke me at 6am and I was relieved to discover I hadn't been
devoured by an army of ants overnight. I would have liked to start the day
by adjusting the valves, but the ants were as busy as the previous night,
so after brewing up coffee and washing the dishes I got ready to head off
into town to find somewhere to do an oil change and have my charging system
seen to. Before pushing the bus to the start of the slope, I tried the key;
the engine turned slowly, once, and roared to life.

I found the local VW dealer closed up. A man in the back told me it just
went bankrupt. He directed me to an auto electrician and the auctioneer who
was to be selling off the dealer's assets on Friday, two days hence. The
bus started by itself again and I headed straight for the auctioneers.
There I found the dealer's parts inventory and workshop tools. I wasn't
planning on being anywhere near these parts come Friday, but I had to
check, just in case.
Pity I didn't have my parts list and workshop tools for local manufacture book.

A search of the parts revealed two things: the first was that there were a
few vintage Type2 parts among them (the previous year when I passed through
this town, I had asked the longest-serving man on this dealer's parts
counter if he had any parts at all to fit my bus, but he said no), and
secondly the lots had been arranged by group number (the middle three
digits in the nine-digit part#), so that similar parts were all lumped
together, whether from vintage bus or new Audi. I saw a NOS rear brake drum
(big nut, 64-67), as well as quite a few transmission bearings, including
the expensive N207E from the redux boxes and what looked like the obscenely
expensive main drive shaft bearing, but without parts list I couldn't be
sure. There were also a few Bug parts and piles of special tools. The only
one I could recognise was the puller for the front wheel bearing cap.

I asked the auctioneer if it would be possible to separate vintage parts
into a single lot. No, came the reply; they'd hired someone from the dealer
to work out the lots and they didn't know a differential from a dipstick
and if I wanted to bid on individual parts it would just have to be in the
lots as sorted. Oh well, I really wanted that drum and the trans bearings
would have been a nice prize, but I didn't really have money to spend, nor
did I really want to hang around there for another two days to buy a pile
of Golf parts for a couple of (hard to find) bus bits.

So I moved on to the auto electrician. A test showed the generator to be
working fine but the regulator to be dodgy. I had suspected this as the
charge light went out as soon as the engine started. He didn't have a new
one, but strung up a new cable directly between battery and regulator,
assuring me that the problem was just old cabling and bad connections.
Yeah, right. He clearly didn't want to spend any time solving my problem,
but at least I got 20 minutes of battery charging out of him.

I hit the road again into a cool morning. But almost immediately the bus
started misfiring at higher revs, losing power completely until I slowed
down. I kept driving, speeding up and slowing down until I was sure the
problem was fuel delivery and not electrics, before pulling over at a
lay-by, where I drained the oil into some plastic containers I had
collected from a trash can earlier. While the oil drained I removed and
stripped the carb. It turned out to be a sticky needle valve. I blew
through it a few times, and it seemed to be working fine. Probably just a
bit of grit, I thought, and reassembled. Then I removed the oil strainer,
to find it and the oil nice and clean. I reinstalled with new gaskets and
refilled the engine with fresh oil.

Then it was back on the road, to discover that I had cured the misfire. Now
I was driving the bus at full speed (I use 60mph as my maximum on a big-nut
trans). She was purring along, smooth and powerful. After about 50km I
stopped for petrol in the dusty Karoo town of Aberdeen, where I also dumped
the old oil.

At Aberdeen I had planned to cut west on a different road, before hitting
the main Jo'burg-Cape Town highway and heading south on it a while, where I
planned to the cut west again on the road to Sutherland, a tiny hamlet atop
a 1 600m plateau in the middle of the arid Karoo. Sutherland has the
distinction of being the coldest place in South Africa and the site of the
national observatory, which I wanted to visit. A call on my cellphone to
the observatory told me I could visit for a guided tour during the daytime
but, being a research institution, its telescopes were not for use by the
public at night.

I looked at the road map and saw that I'd have to drive about 200km along
the most dangerous section of the main N1 highway to get to the Sutherland
turn-off. Then followed an interesting-looking back road up the escarpment
for 100km. But I could also keep heading directly south and visit my
friends Sharon and Robert in the Knysna forest. I weighed things up a while
before Rob and Shaz and the forest won out. I called Robert on his cell and
was lucky to get through to him (they don't have reception up in the
mountains, but he was in nearby Plettenberg Bay for the day). He was
surprised to hear from me, but said I should come right over, and gave me
directions to their place in the forest. I told him I'd get there about
nightfall. I still had about 300km to cover.

So I kept on the same road south, still in the Karoo, but the land was
rocky and hilly now. After a while I passed the village of Willowmore, and
soon afterwards the turn-off to Baviaanskloof, where the Dormobile took us
on a previous trip (report's in the list archives). A large sign showed the
road to be closed due to flood damage. It was barely passable when we went
through two years previously.

I kept moving, and in the late afternoon watched a thunderstorm come up
over the mountains ahead and dump a lot of rain on the parched earth of the
Karoo on the horizon. The storm had moved away by the time I drove through
where it passed, but the countryside was transformed. The Karoo is
semi-desert, and that storm was probably half the annual rainfall. What is
normally barren and rocky land covered in dry watercourses had become a
place of running streams and waterfalls. I stopped and walked about for a
while, marvelling at the scene. It would all be dry again by morning.

Soon afterwards I stopped for fuel at Uniondale, a village as dusty and
poverty stricken as any other in the Karoo. The place was barely damp in
the sun after the rain. The engine was now running very cool. The dipstick
felt as cool as a DP, and I usually find SPs run hotter than DPs. The main
route bore west after Uniondale, running parallel to the mountain range
before the coast. I headed south, down the Prince Alfred's Pass, a 70km
gravel road through the mountains and the Knysna forest. The pass road was
built about 140 years ago and has changed little since. Lots of hairpin
bends and low retaining walls at the edge of steep precipices. At the top
of the pass I drove into a dense fog. Visibility was down to a few metres
as I slowly made the descent, surrounded by opaque whiteness. I got a
strangely vertiginous feeling as I imagined the steep drops that I could
not see through the white blanket all around.

The pass road had deteriorated markedly since last I'd driven it, and there
were several sections so rough I had to crawl along in first to keep the
Dormobile from shaking itself to pieces. At one stage I came around a
corner to find that a large rock about half the size of the bus had very
recently fallen from the mountain above and embedded itself in the road's
edge, demolishing part of the retaining wall in the process. It had
probably fallen in the storm that I saw earlier. I gave thanks that it
didn't fall on me.

Soon the road descended into the forest and the mist thinned a little.
Presently I reached a fork in the road, right to Knysna and left to
Plettenberg Bay and Rob and Shaz's neck of the woods. I bore left and soon
arrived in the motley collection of houses where they live in the forest.
The houses are part of a &quot;bosdorp&quot; (forest village) owned by the state
forestry company Safcol, which is in the process of being privatised.
Safcol managers no longer live in the several bosdorpe scattered through
the forest, and they have been taken over by communities of hippie types.
Safcol doesn't want people in the houses and does not maintain them and
demolishes any of them that stand empty. But the residents pay rent to
Safcol and they live in an uneasy peace with the company.

I found Rob and Shaz's place, their 58 Kombi parked outside with tall grass
in the wheelwells. They hadn't yet returned from Plett, so I set up camp in
their yard in the dusk after renewing my acquaintance with their dogs. They
arrived soon after in their battered Renault and we spent the evening
talking over a few beers from my cooler box. I was ready to cook up a big
dinner from my camping supplies, but none of us was hungry. There didn't
seem to be any food in their house. Rob and Shaz left stressful jobs in the
city to come and live in near poverty in the forest, but they're adamant
that it was a good choice. They do whatever piece work they can get in the
nearby coastal tourist resorts of Plett and Knysna, and seem to have enough
to run a car and pay their rent and feed themselves.

Next door to Rob and Shaz lives Keith, another old friend from Jo'burg, who
together with his girlfriend runs a curio and craft shop in Plett. I had
hoped to borrow his battery charger, but he had left it in his shop. As it
happened they were having charging problems with their Beetle. Keith also
has a very nice 66 panelvan, but it was with the local mechanic at the
time. Most of the cars up there are wrecks because of the terrible roads.

Early next morning we all went for a walk in the forest for a few hours.
Then we had a leisurely brunch, after which I enjoyed an outdoor shower
before getting ready to leave just before noon, much later than I'd
planned. My friend Judi was expecting me in Cape Town in the early evening,
and that was still at least 500km away.

As I got ready to roll-start the Dormobile out of their yard, Rob gave me a
map of the forest and recommended several foresters' tracks for the route
out. He also said that I should try to make the time to drive to the top of
Spitskop, the highest point in the forest, for the view.

On the back tracks I apparently had the forest to myself as I saw no signs
of people until I arrived on the Knysna fork of the Prince Alfred's Pass
road. Instead of headling left to Knysna and the coast I took Rob's advice
and turned back inland for a way until I came acros the turn-off to the
Spitskop. Then started a tortuous ascent on a narrow, rutted road that
zig-zagged up one side of a conical peak that sticks up about 750m above
the forest, which is more-or-less at sea level.

At the top was a group in a new Mitsubishi 4x4. I parked the Dormobile and
enjoyed the 360 degree panorama and took some photographs. While I was up
there another group, this time German diplomats, arrived, in a new Toyota
Land Cruiser, followed shortly afterwards by another group in a 4x4.
Everybody ignored me and my 36-year-old hippie bus, perhaps because its age
and two-wheel drive made them feel not quite so tough and rugged in getting
their new 4x4s up the mountain.

By then it was getting quite late if I was to be getting to Cape Town, so I
resisted the temptation to take more of the foresters' tracks and headed
straight to the main N2 coastal highway at Knysna and pointed the Dormobile
at Cape Town, some 450km west. I was breaking my back roads rule, but my
battery was flat and it was late afternoon. I would only reach Cape Town
late in the night and there was a few hours of night driving ahead. I
normally also avoid travelling at night, because I hate knowing that I'm
driving through scenery that I can't enjoy. I wondered if the generator
would push out enough power to run the ignition and the lights.

This section of the N2 is known as the Garden Route, and is a well-known
scenic drive. The Dormobile cruised on smoothly through Sedgefield and
Wilderness, past the turn-off to the city of George a little inland, and
then past the industrial port of Mossel Bay, where the scenic route ended.

Soon afterwards I was pulled over by traffic cops for a roadworthiness and
licence check. I kept the engine running and fortunately they didn't tell
me to switch off while they checked the tyres, lights and indicators. It
would have been kind of embarrassing to explain the flat battery. They sent
me on my way with a warning that my left rear brake light wasn't working.

I pressed on, keeping up a more-or-less steady 60mph across the flat plain
of the Overberg into the setting sun. Just after sunset I pulled off for
petrol, and had the pump attendant roll me off the forecourt to get the
Dormobile barrelling back down the highway, its 12 volt halogen headlight
beams a strange yellow colour, but still giving adequate light. The engine
never missed a beat.

Still 130km from Cape Town I passed the turn-off to the village of Greyton,
where I own a small plot of land at the foot of a mountain range. I was
tempted to turn off and camp there for the night, still fearing the
Dormobile would suddenly die on me as the last dregs of juice were
extracted from the battery. But I had to keep my date with Judi and I'd be
back this way when heading back home, so I kept moving, through Grabouw,
down Sir Lowrie's Pass and through Somerset West, where my sister and her
family just moved, then across the Cape Flats, past the sprawling, smoky
shantytowns of Crossroads and Guguletu, and beyond into Cape Town,
marvelling as always at my first glimpse of the floodlit Table Mountain.

Soon afterwards I was greeted by Judi in the street outside her house in
Newlands, bordering on the forest at the base of the mountain. We chatted
for a while, catching up on our lives since last we'd been together, then I
gratefully crashed on her couch, exhausted.

NEXT: Cape Town and breakdown
