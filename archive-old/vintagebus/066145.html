Subject: I'm lookin' for...

Hi all,

I was working on my '59 D.D Panel yesterday and just now noticed that I'm
missing a fuse box cover.  Not on the Bus when I bought it last year.  Would
anyone have a decent to nice condition black fuse box cover correct for a June
1959 Bus.  If I remember correctly, it should screw onto the fuse box with a
small diameter screw in the center of the black plastic cover.  Anyway, if you
can help, please let me know privately via email, and thanks for looking!
