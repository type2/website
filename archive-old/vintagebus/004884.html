Subject: 1956 Rear reflectors &amp; Some ?? &amp; Tacos

Did all 1956 buses have reflectors below the taillights? Saw 2 at Pomona
that did not. Did different countries have different specs? Looked inside
and saw no signs of body work or the small square hole for the reflectors.
Also looked at 1 1956 bus after Pomona and it had reflectors.

What does Type 2/23 mean on VIN plate? Think I know but want to verify.

Tacos (Thanks to London Bridge Bullis) and RICE (thanks to Stan and Steve
and most of all Pearle from VTO) this year at Jerome. Will do it Friday
night. Be there around 5/6 PM.
