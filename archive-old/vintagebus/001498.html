Wow, I just read all the backed up VB posting from this weekend and it
reminds me of the movie The Godfather; &quot;Nothing personal, it's just
business&quot;, and then they wack you.  I guess if there weren't people who
found a way to make money out of other people's hobbies then we all wouldn't
have the products we need to keep our little VW &quot;habit&quot; satisfied.  But
sometimes you gotta wonder if &quot;just business&quot;  is &quot;just business&quot; or really
&quot;just greed&quot;. Too bad the parents of the group couldn't have ironed it out
in private instead of having this blow out in front of us &quot;kids&quot; (I'll be in
therapy for years on this).

Thanks,

Kevin Sullivan
