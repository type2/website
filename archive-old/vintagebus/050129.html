Subject: 6V -&gt; 12V Wipers, it's ALMOST there


I have a raft of Pandora (64 EZ) pics to go up soon BTW.

Anyway the wiper bits were all in a big coffee can when I got her. I was
told to finish off converting the wipers to 12V as this was about the only
step of the 12V conversion left undone. I spent some time with the archive
and it seems the inline resistor is frowned upon as a kludge so I tried to
do it the right way instead.

I think I have two 6V motors, all the 6V parts, plus one big black rack of
a thing that I THINK is out of a 67. Probably a 67 gave its life for this
bus at one point because the rear driveline is all 67 and I know this wiper
assembly is exquisitely rare. 8)

Anyway I gave current to the big black rack and it turns fine, took it
apart and cleaned it out and greased it up nice. It seems to have almost no
wear whatsoever.

Got it all installed, had to remove the package tray and clearance a little
up inside the dash but nothing too difficult. Everything works fine. There
are new rubber grommets at the body but I'm still sort of itching to smear
silicone around a little. I still might.

ANYWAY it works great but what do you do about the switch? The switch will
fit in place and fits through the hole in the dash, but it's intended to
use that threaded insert thing like the bay windows use rather than the set
screw underneath like the earlier buses. So it just waggles around loose.
Is there an elegant solution to this? Please save Pandora from JB Weld! 8)
