That's the tool for drilling for case savers.

You bolt it to the side of the case and use a drill bushing in the holes
to guide your drill in straight. It isn't complete without the bushing,
but I guess that's something you could buy from someplace like
McMaster-Carr or Harbor Freight.

Since it lines up in the cylinder holes, it only works if you have case
that matches the round line-up thingys (otherwise known as pilots). Most
likely the one in the picture is for a 1500/1600, but you know the deal.
You pays yer money and you takes yer chances.
