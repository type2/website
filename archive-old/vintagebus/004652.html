[...]

Before you get into this any deeper, it's vital to know whether these speeds
are _indicated_ MPH or _corrected_ MPH.  [See the archives for speedo
calibration procedure.]

VW speedometers can be notoriously optimistic.  If these are _indicated_
speeds, your true MPH is probably significantly lower than these numbers.

Some folks prefer to cruise at 3,000RPM max., although experience has shown
[and VW specs verify] that 4,000 is actually pretty conservative for the
typical 1600 SP or DP engine.

FWIW.....

&gt;&gt;  i was watching my speed and rpm last night and this morning and heres
what i cam up with.
all are 4th gear:
40mph  3000rpm
50mph  3750
55mph  4000
60mph  4500
like i said before, i always try to stay righ around 62mph on road trips.
but, that cruising rpm seems sooo high. should i get taller tires?  &lt;&lt;
