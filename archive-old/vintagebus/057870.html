Subject: VW Protest

The Vintage Volkswagen Club of Michigan
The MVVC is attempting to confront Volkswagen on the issue of the
trademark and copyright
lawsuits and their alienation of the air-cooled community. To do this we
need your help. The
company that made the cars we love is, as the saying goes &quot;being penny
wise, and dollar
foolish.&quot; In an attempt to protect it's trade marked properties VW is
loosing the die hard
loyalists that it worked on for decades to build. They are driving away
the very group that
sustained them in the late 80s and early 90s. We all recognize VW's
right to protect
trademarks. But to do so without guidelines for the after market
industry, independent repair
facilities and even the hobbyist and clubs is incredibly short sighted
and an insult to their
most loyal fans.
Included is a brief form you can fill out. In the form are information
boxes to provide the
demographic information that will show VW what they potentially can and
will loose if they
continue to interact with the hobby in this manner. To put it another
way, sadly VW seems to be
concerned only with the dollars earned now from it's legal tactics. Fill
out the form, and show
them how many more dollars they will loose later.
