Depending on how miracle this material is, this is a pretty good price.

Dynamat and VBlock go for $30-$80 for ~ the same amount.

There's been some discussion on the Lists lately about soundproofing and
insulating strategies.

I recently received a Spring catalog from American Science and Surplus, a
must have for widget and oddity enthusiasts, and on page 8, under the
&quot;Materials&quot; heading they list &quot;Sound Absorbing Foam&quot; [item # 30866].

The blurb reads in part:

    &quot;Miracle foam made to sound deaden cars.  Each sheet is about 33&quot;X17&quot;X1&quot;
thick.  Gray in color, it can be  cut with a knife or large scissors.  It is
quite soft...  It is laminated onto a pretty rigid backing which in turn has
a self adhesive coating.&quot;

The price is $9.50 each.

Seems like a pretty steep price, even for &quot;miracle foam&quot;, but if it's the
genuine article.....

American Science and Surplus has an online catalog, and their URL is:
www.sciplus_dot_com

FWIW.....
