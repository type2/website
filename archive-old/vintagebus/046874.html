 I have a problem that is a little wierd.  If anyone has some insite
 please let me know.
 
 All my rubber is new, completely around the bus.  My passenger door
 closes tight.  My driver's side door closes tight but has just a little 
 alignment problem in that it sticks out maybe 1/8&quot; from the body.
 
 When it rains, the door will not stay shut.  It will seem like it is 
 latched, but if I turn right it flies open.  A good bump and it's open.
 If I slam it from the middle of the door, the toggle latch closes, but 
 doesn't grab the post.  If I slam it from the back of the door, it 
 seems to shut (it hasn't come open at least).
  &gt;&gt;
It's from your bad karma for not sending me the money for the parts I sent 
you for this bus.

Clara
