I stopped by yesterday to check out the Pandora bus. Ken wasn't home, but I spied as much as I could without being disrespectful. I was impressed by a fairly straight bus worth far more than was paid. I commented to Erin that the engine was probably worth the price of the bus and she indicated that those were Ken's thoughts as well. I'd say Chip contributed significantly to the cause. Thanks Chip! :) 

I spied the M codes and discovered two options: separate seats for a panel or kombi (it started life as a panel; and the infamous 475, a secret M-code that was revealed only to a few VW initiates who apparently aren't giving up the secret. So this was a walk-thru panel at one point.

The conversion, though appearing home-made to me was done well and based on the westy interior. I believe this may be a sundial, but it may simply be homemade. The windows are not altogether like sundial windows I'm familiar with. They each sport a single pane and a crank at the base. As you crank the window, it lifts straight up. An aluminum gutter/shade deflects rain above each window. I believe the bed is a &quot;W-bed,&quot; though it may be a z-bed as Ken's indicated.

Very few dents and not much rust (except the nose), from what I could see. The cargo floor near the side doors will need to be replaced, as will the driver's side floor. The well-bondo'd nose will need some attention, but it's there and solid...though it kinda reminds me of Tammy Fay Baker's nose with all that bondo on it (just kidding, Tammy; just kidding Ken).

This is a bus worthy of a long life. It is, in my opinion, a fine choice and well worth the wait.

Take care! Joe
