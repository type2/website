&gt; I had to do the same thing with my SC. Fortunately, all the PO did was lower

&gt; the Bently and readjusted them back to 20 degrees. I built a spring plate
&gt; compression tool just like the one shown in the pictures and a simple degree
&gt; plate.

Nice to have proper tools, but I did it with a floor jack (the tension on
the spring plate isn't much at full extension) and a dime-store
protractor.  Just drill a hole through the &quot;center&quot; of the protractor, run
a thread through the hole and put a nut or somesuch on the end of the
thread.  Level the bus front-to-rear, put the flat side of the protractor
against the bottom of the lever, lift the lever to take any play out of
the splines, and read where the thread lies on the protractor.  Subtract
the number from 90 and you have the angle of the lever.
