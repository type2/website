Subject: Re: [VB] N.A.D.A. Our Buses Value

But in a perfect world where there was no need for
repop stuff there would be more buses availabe for
parts and for sale at good prices.

&gt; Hm, In the last ten years there has been a lot more
&gt; repro parts available for 
&gt; splitties.  The quality of the repro bits has gotten
&gt; better, and sometimes 
&gt; cheaper.  Why?  Cause a lot of people are willing to
&gt; spend some cash on these 
&gt; buses.  Makes it easier for me to keep the beasties
&gt; going.  I don't think we 
&gt; can pray at the sacred church of the VW bus and
&gt; expect some  hippy 
&gt; free/barter community.   The places that make and
&gt; sell parts are business, 
&gt; many of them run but people who love old buses, but
&gt; gotta pay the bills you 
&gt; know.
