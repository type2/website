Jeffrey:

I believe Das Bulli Haus only sells repro doglegs for '63 and up.  You're best bet would be to check with Thom.  I cut out a pair of doglegs for Thom for his '54 out of a '58 Kombi.  I would suggest the same for you.  Try and find a donor bus, '62 or earlier, that you can cut some out of.

The '58 was in a salvage yard, so I used a cordless Sawzall.  If you don't have access to a cordless one, a gas generator and regular Sawzall would be even better, just more stuff to have to lug around.  I think most salvage yards won't allow torches due to liability issues, but California seems to be a bit more anal than a lot of states.

Good luck!

Robert
