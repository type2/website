Maybe behind that smile it had big, gnashing teeth. Check this site to see if it's related... http://www.mwscomp_dot_com/movies/grail/grail-21.htm

Bus content...
The 10th annual Madera Spring Fling was the biggest ever. A lot of parts and goodies and a rare bus for sale. Roger Nang and John Furst come down to pick our area clean of vintage parts. They got a couple of goodies from my spares pile. 
The rare bus was an upper vent option single cab. Left hand drive. I didn't inspect it closely, but it had the vent covers on either side of the rear window and no intake slots by the engine. John said it was beat up pretty bad. They were asking $1,200, no gates. Sorry, don't have any other details. Greg Banfill was vending, maybe he took a closer look.
