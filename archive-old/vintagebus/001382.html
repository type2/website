&gt; I'm trying to swap steering wheels.  Read the Type2 Library, and I
&gt; wondered if there's another way to do this that may be easier
&gt; (please no
&gt; sawzall comments).
&gt;
&gt;
I've had great results with the following method:

I used a standard two-arm puller and fabbed a up a C-shaped steel plate  to
protect the bottom of the wheel. Remove the self-canceller ring as ronnie
suggests.

I then set up the puller so that it put the wheel under some tension, but
not so much that anything is in danger of cracking. Keep the nut on the
steering shaft to protect the threads, and place a coin over the top so the
puller shaft does not ream out ther steering shaft.

Now for the neat part: get a kettle of boiling water and pour boiling water
into the cavities in the steering boss. Immediately sponge it out and
refill. Repeat until the boss warms up enough to expand. At this point the
tension of the puller will cause the wheel to jump off.

Works for me every time. Boiling water is the only way to heat a steering
wheel without melting it.
