&lt;&lt;The oil pump (melling) intake port's fine.  The outlet port only opens to 
about half of the case port.  Is it ok to open the oil pump port to better 
match the case?&gt;&gt;
Yes, you really need to open the outlet side to the same as the case oil 
passageway.  If you are very carefull not to scar up the outer sealing 
diameter of the pump you will not get any leaks.  You would be wise to wrap 
the outside of this diameter with tape to protect the surface before you 
machine the outlet bigger.

&lt;&lt;If I don't go full flow remote then I have a restricted oil pump outlet. &gt;&gt;
Correct, and not too great of oil pressure especially dure summer weather!
