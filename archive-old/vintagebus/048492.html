Subject: Maybe Freeway Flyers Aren't So Bad

Hi Everybody,

Following a suggestion from Dworkin about my mileage problem, I bought a
stopwatch and took my bus for a spin on the freeway and came up with some
interesting stuff.

At an indicated 60mph, I clocked 60 seconds at the mile markers, doing that
at least five times to get a good reading.

However, the odometer took a full 83 seconds to click off a mile at 60 mph.
I figured a 38% error and went back to my mileage log and discovered the
actual mpg has been 17-23 instead of 12-16. I've been focusing too much on
the engine/gearing/brakes that I overlooked the obvious. I just assumed the
speedo/odometer were linked pretty closely; obviously not. Thanks for the
suggestions, folks.

Still Grinning,
Everett
