Subject: Overhead Vent Rehab II?
Content-type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII

The overhead vent in my  63 does not really turn off. I took off the cover
thinking that this would be a neat place to install gauges but decided against
it thinking that rev counters do not like the wet.

I noticed that the seal was not reall closing it shut and in the winter I will
want to shut it,
anybody have the rubber seal??
