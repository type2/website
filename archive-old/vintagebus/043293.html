&gt; about 30 pounds!The thing is,the motor sounded really strong other than the 
&gt; knock,no smoke or anything like that.Do you guys think its still ok? I 
&gt; figure the fact that it was hitting the bell housing and had a loose fly 
&gt; wheel pretty well accounts for the noise so........

Once on a trip from Tallahassee to Charlotte NC (1k mi rt) I started
hearing some funky knocking that changed with clutch pedal movement and
engine load.  68 Westy.

Ended up sleeping in a truck stop with the ex and two kids, woke up at
dawn and pulled the engine.  The flywheel was loose, somehow the gland nut
had backed off.  Cranked it down tight and went on (by the end of the trip
the driver's seat bottom cushion had a big pucker mark in it).  Made it to
Charlotte and back within 100 miles of home when it worked loose again.
Did the same R&amp;R on a hot motor in a Ga. Highway Patrol parking lot.  Made
it home and within a week it did it again.

The dowel pins had wallered out the crank holes (I guess _so_), but the
flywheel holes looked OK.  I bought a bit and borrowed a jig from good old
Bob Gillam, drilled 4 new holes in the end of the crank, reused the
dowels, and it never did it again.

It ran for several more years of local and interstate driving before my
brother-in-law blew it up on I-10 (it was his by then).  I'm sure the
floppy flywheel problem shortened its life, but not drastically.

No guarantees, but I'd check for ovaled dowel holes, redrill if you need
to (could use the flywheel for a jig in a pinch), crank down that gland
nut, and give her a go.
