&gt; I have asked Clara to find out the vintage of the 211 857 513C mirrors and 
&gt; she does not have a book that covers that year.

Hi Sam,
Those mirrors do not show up in any manual we have.  Best guess is they are 
much later made accessory mirrors.  As for the correct basic exterior mirror 
would be a single round one on the driver side.
