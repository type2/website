 When I was getting my plates here in CO for my 66 Samba which was purchased 
 in CA with a HI title, I had a hell of a time getting even a temporary tag 
 because 1) the VIN did not have enough digits, and the DMV computer would 
 not accept it, 2) the previous title in HI said the bus was white and 
 purple, and the DMV person thought the purple was really more of a dark 
 blue, and that I was therefore trying to commit some sort of fraud.  These 
 &quot;discrepencies&quot; kept me in a legal loop for about two months.
 
 Furthermore, when I tried to insure the vehical to get the plates, the 
 insurance company added zeros onto the end of the VIN so it would have 
 enough digits for their computer to accept it.  When I took my insurance 
 card to the DMV, they accused me of making up a VIN since no VIN could have 
 that many zeros in a row.
 
 
 ARRRGGGGGGGG!!!!
 
 
 Now maybe people can imagine my problems. First there was my 1952 Zwitter. 
It was registered in Ontario as a 1953, because it was first sold in 1953. I 
had to take
a picture of a late 1952 VW down to the Texas license plate office and 
convince them
that it was a 1952. I wanted it to be a 1952 so that I could call it a 
Zwitter. They approved the reclassification, and that was that. About a year 
later, I bought a 1956
beetle on a 1954 chassis, and I wanted to get it classified as a 1956, 
because it has a 1956 body on it. They approved it locally, but the office in 
Austin has held it up for
some reason. It's still pending.
