Subject: Anybody tried this?
Date: Thu, 12 Nov 1998 11:04:40 -0600

I was talking to one of those guru kind of guys yesterday,
about this and that, how I was going to do this, and if I did
what was I going to do about that.  And the subject of heating
came up, in accordance with using a different exhaust.  And this
guru guy says &quot;why don't you look into using an external oil 
filter to warm the air and a fan to blow it through the heater pipes?&quot;
He says it'd be just like a fresh air but not from the exhaust boxes,
which he says would be better and safer.  He says the cooler
could be mounted inside the left wheel well, inside the torsion bar,
with a fan and a housing with a flap (for winter and summer).  And 
since the oil temp would always be above 200, I'd have hot air any
time I wanted.

I know this has been advertised in the rags, but it has always had the 
cooler inside the cab.

Would this work, in your humble opinions?

Cecil
