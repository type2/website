Taking the path of least resistance, I've got to say that I like them both.
If I could find a girlfriend (trying to find one that likes VWs is tough),
I'd probably like the bench seat but for now, my bachlerhood and
practicalness says walk-thru repeatedly.  I've ridden in a 67 benchseat and
talk about packing people in - 3 or 4 across the front and everyone and
everything else in the back.  I think you loose seating with a walkthru
though.  There are pros and cons to both sides but neither one is the best
or worst. :-)
