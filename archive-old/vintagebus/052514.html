Subject: RE: [VB] Wiring through bellypans?

no. on a bus with belly pans, there is a metal tube that the wiring harness
runs through. there are clips near the front axle and near the back, but
not underneath the belly pans. make very sure when pulling the old one out,
you either have the new one attached to it very securely, or use something
along the lines of an old clutch cable to route through to pull the new one
back through. and don't get the wires too bundled up, or they won't fit
through the tube at all. it's not too bad if it does get stuck, because it
is in a tube and really has no other place to run other than in the tube.
and start at the front of the bus and fish it towards the back. it's always
seemed to be easier for me to do it that way.
good luck. it's not really that hard, especially with nice, new, flexible
wiring.

&gt; Ronnie, John Howard, Matt Earle &amp; I am working to replace my wiring
harness 
&gt; this weekend and were discussing the issue of the securing clips that run 
&gt; along the frame rail.
&gt; 
&gt; On buses equiped with belly pans, are these clips in place? We want to
make 
&gt; sure that we can get the old wiring out (and fish wire in) without
breaking 
&gt; it.
