well, the link didn't work for me, but the real question is 'is this what 
your dad wants to drive?   

does he want a slammed bus with those bits on it?   

Does he want to dump 20K?  

 If he is really into that, then you can get an independent person to look at 
this bus.   All safaris leak.   I live in Oly WA, and sold the original 
safaris out of my 65 westy cause I couldn't deal with going through that 
again, and they leaked.  Drip drip drip.  

 Anyway,  you could find a decent daily driver bus for much less I am sure.

I would say- what is it he wants in a bus?      

I bought a ratty non running 65 westy a few years ago, and now it is good for 
driving on long trips or to the beach.  Even looks pretty - shiny green&amp;white 
though no show winner.  Have a roof rack, camper kit, fairly well sealed, 
good heat (though it is chilly when is is below freezing outside)  most 
windows resealed so only the popout which weren't re done have leaks

Yes a bus can be a daily driver in the PNW.   

I would get in touch with local bus people and see what is happening in your 
area.  I am sure there are buses up there you could look at, so he can see 
what there is, and look for rust, cause you do tend to get attached to these 
beasts, so try to find a good one.
