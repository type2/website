I have one of these, too (anybody want to buy it cheap?). On mine, a bolt
passes through the left side of jack point, through the step-attachment
thingie and has a nut holding it in place on the right side of the jack
point. In other words, after you pulled the step out you should see a whole
drilled through the jackpoint where the bolt assembly used to be.

If it's any consulation, my bus is also held together by rust.

&gt; I bought a bus with one of those steps on the passenger side that hook up
&gt; into
&gt; the jack points.  It was rather rusted in there so I beat on it and it
&gt; came
&gt; out easily.  But I think I'm missing a part or something because I don't
&gt; know
&gt; how it stays in there without rust.  How are they locked in there?  Any
&gt; help
&gt; would be appreciated!
