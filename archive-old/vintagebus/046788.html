So, what are you going to do, Thom?  

If your trailing arms break, I might have a spare set of barndoor ones, but I 
could be wrong.  Need to look at my spindle pile as the upper left king pin 
bushing area is worn on my 65, and getting annoying, time to see if I have a 
decent used left 64-67 spindle.

so, I guess you might have to find that wrong hand drive BD n the pick and 
pull,?

Nope, the swing lever is not in the center on a barndoor, and
there's a separate RHD/LHD beam.

&gt; Uhhh,
&gt; 
&gt; arent RHD and LHD beams identical and all considering the swing lever is
&gt; in the middle...
