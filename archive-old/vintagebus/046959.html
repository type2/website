Subject: Re: [VB] Sandblasting a panel?
To: wades_wagens_at_uswest_dot_net, VintageBus_at_type2_dot_com

If you have ever been to the 4 Peaks Brewery, you probably has seen their 
59(?) 7 door panel.  That bus was SANDblasted before having the body work 
done.  There is nothing wrong with sandblasting as long as it is done with 
care.  It's like welding sheet metal.  You can't do too much in one spot at 
one time.  This takes a little longer, but if you must have everything 
removed from the metal and you want to keep it here in the Phoenix area, then 
your choices are limited.  What about only blasting the more contoured areas 
and leaving the large flat panel areas for machine sanding or paint stripper?

Just some thoughts....
