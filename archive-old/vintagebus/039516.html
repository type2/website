This is not a family event, unless you are comfortable with having your kids 
exposed to lots of drugs.  Everything I've seen on this is just as was 
stated &quot;a place for the yuppies to go and play hippie&quot;.  The big drugs are 
LSD, Shrooms and that worthless stuff ecstacy.  I'd rather trip somewhere 
else without the crazy people, not that I do that anymore though.
    Too many people associate splitties with hippies all ready.
