Hi Pete,
Definitely!  Engines come, and go, but your bus will be the one to stay with 
that speedo.  You would do well to start a log book instead.  This really 
helps to keep track of the parts replaced repaired, plus the MPG  tracking 
has many times helped us to realize that there was something else needed to 
be replaced, reworked, or realigned.   Eric&amp;Barb
