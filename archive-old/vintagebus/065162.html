Subject: Re: [VB] Welding trouble

I hope there is a trick I am missing someone will tell me about. The
welder is a
new Lincoln 110V wirefeed with gas, and seems to be working properly. I
turn it
all the way down to make the butt welds, and the faster I move the better
I do,
but I'm still burning too much metal to try this with the floor.
----------------------------------------
I've used wire feeds for thirty years and its a lot to do with the
adjustments.
#1) Gas Flow
#2) Wire speed
#3) Wire Size
#4) Heat range
I'd suggest that you not count on strength from butt welds unless you 45
degree bend the metal down and fill the grove, in other words you need a
fillet weld. Fill the grove and grind later.
In addition you need to move the wire from side to side like the marks
you see a Lie Detector or Seizmic Printer make on the paper. This way
you're controlling the heat and it rolls rather than bunches or dobbles.
The best way to get you hands onto welding that really marginal metal is
just practice up on some scraps until you develop your own technique.
Another trick ................ don't have any fans around blowing your
Argon/Co2 away.
Another trick ............... pop rivet a piece of steel on the backside
and weld through to it, 5/8&quot; steel straping works good.
