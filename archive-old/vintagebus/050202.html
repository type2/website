Subject: Re: [VB] Water in my lines (long complaint for help)

&gt;&gt; Do I need to buy yet another water trap?  I am really getting poor, so
&gt;&gt; whatever I do, it's gotta be cheap!

I made a water trap myself for very little money and it works great. What I
did was buy some small PVC and some elbow joints. I run from the compressor
about 2 feet and then put a &quot;T&quot; joint. I go down from the &quot;T&quot; joint just
enough to connect a valve. I go from the &quot;T&quot; joint about a foot or foot and
a half and then an elbow. I go sideways again about a foot and then an
elbow. I then go back down about a foot and a half to another &quot;t&quot; joint
with a valve on the bottom again. Out from the &quot;t&quot; joint sideways to a
Wal-Mart water filter I already had. All of the PVC, joints, valves, and
adapters cost less than $10. And it works GREAT for me. I NEVER get water
in my line anymore. A paint and body guy told me to do this and I'm very
glad I did. The whole set-up looks kind of like this:

                                 ________
                                 I              I
                                 I              I
                                 I              I
Compressor---------I              I---water filter---hose
                                 I              I
              valve---&gt;    I              I    &lt;----valve


Hope that diagram came through OK.

I've got a 5HP 30 gallon compressor and my Sand Blaster is too much for it
to be able to go without stopping. But everything else I use it for is
fine. So it's a tough call on getting a new one. I will eventually. But I
can't rationalize it right now. I am ABLE to blast. I just have to do it
while I'm doing other things instead of doing it all at once. Kind of go
back and forth. Still the best and most effeciant way for me to strip paint
and get rid of rust...even with the delays.
