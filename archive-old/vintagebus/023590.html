You use the words beautiful bus and project in the same story. Sounds like a 
nice bus as it sits now. Gone this many years and built up so much character, 
don't paint it yet. Fix the rust, blend in some paint on the new body work 
and WALA!

&lt;&lt; Got home today with my new project, a '67 Walk-Thru Pop Top.  Been thinking
 about getting a camper for a while but not seriously until Thom put his &quot;55
 up for sale.  Then I decided that I needed a camper.  Bought it Wednesday
 and flew to LA Saturday to pick it up.  It's beautiful.  Mostly orginal
 paint, Pearl White (buffed in few places to the primer), with only one major
 cancer spot along the bottom of the cargo doors and sill.  The kit is
 compleatly intact including the child cot, screen cover for rear hatch and
 filler seat for the walk thru.  Everything works and is clean.  The entire
 break system was recently rebuilt as well as the front beam and the
 transmission (with 4th gear FF).  The motor is a 1600 SP that looks like the
 orginal.  The engine compartment is rust and corrosion free as well as the
 undercarrage.  There's aftermarket safari's and a shift lock.  I drove it up
 the coast (HiWay 1) stopping at Pismo Beach to spend the night Sunday and
 everything ran smooth and strong.  Finished the trip today and were bonded.
 I plan to use her this summer for weekend camping and then began work in the
 fall.  A little body work here and there and a paint job.  There had been
 air scoops and the screw holes are left.  Also a PO had truck mirrors at one
 time, more holes to fill.  Little dents and scratches, mostly around the
 bottom edges.  All in all this camper has been taken care of for most of
 it's years.  As I look it over to see what I need to do I keep finding
 little treasures.  This morning I inspected the spair tire.  New!!!!  Never
 been on the ground.  I do need to replace the wood panels on the rear hatch
 and cargo doors and a couple of the release latches on the kit.  The
 clincher to the sale was the personalized plate........&quot;WSTFLIA&quot;
 See ya on the road. &gt;&gt;
