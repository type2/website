I wouldn't take it out of town, as your range would be less than a mile
and I don't think that there are gas stations that frequently when you get
to the desert!

Besides, for a 3,000 mile trip, fuel would cost you around $56,250.
I think you should stay home, save the money and just buy a couple 23
window barndoors (lipless) instead!

&gt; It does seem to be running rich that I have yet to solve.

Yeah, I should think so! ;^)
