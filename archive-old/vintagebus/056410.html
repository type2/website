I am working out all the excellent advice given me about sloppy =
steering, but here is a new question; If I decide that my steering box =
is shot, where should I get a rebuilt one?

I checked the net and some other sources and am looking at about $200, =
with my core, before tax and shipping.

I have also been told that the new Brazillians are junk.

Any thoughts?
