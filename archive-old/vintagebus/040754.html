Funny you mention a '66 slider....  I've got a totaled one in my back yard
right now. Same year and everything!

Seems that the DKB boys down in Florida don't have much luck.  The '66
slider in question has been in St. Louis for many years, first owned by Nate
Sorenson, and driven across the US many times while he owned it.  Well, Nate
left to become a bush-pilot in Guatemala, and the bus was left in Kent
Zschoche's field...  fast forward a few years, and Billy Montiel from
Memphis bought it, and got it back on the road.  Well, Billy just moved up
here to Mizzery recently, and decided to sell the Slider...

So, Friday, a guy named John and his girlfriend Cindy flew up to St. Louis,
and plan to buy the slider, and drive it back to Tampa, stopping at
Graceland and various other points of interest along the way.  Well, they
had reservations at Heartbreak Hotel for Friday night, and wanted to just
finalize the deal, and get underway... Well, Billy, as he is known to do,
convinced them to hang out a while and drive around and &quot;see the sights&quot; of
St. Louis.  They drove the slider, Billy drove his flame-jobbed '67 kombi.
Well, after seeing the arch, they're up cruising towards old Rt 66 in my
neck of the woods, when Billy comes up on a car stalled in the middle of the
road.  Well, Billy is doing crazy Billy things in his bus, and not paying
attention.  Billy manages to stop BARELY in time to avoid rear-ending the
stalled car.  John in the slider behind Billy on the other hand, is not so
lucky...  He literally STANDS on the brake pedal, and swerves to avoid
Billy, but hits him hard in the drivers-side corner...  Billy's kombi is
thrust forward into the car in front of him, and gets smashed in the front
as well.  The full-length roof rack on top of the slider (loaded with 2
extra sliding doors) breaks loose and shoots off the bus and onto the
street.

End result: the front of Billy's kombi is FLAT across the front end at
overider height, and the rear corner is smashed in HARD..  the side of the
bus is rippled.  Of course, both bumpers are a total loss as well.  The
front end of the slider is UNBELIEVABLY SMASHED.  The passenger side is
smashed in nearly to the front wheel well... dash is bent, windshield popped
out, floor buckled, etc.  I am totally amazed John's girlfriend is not in
the hospital or dead, but she got away without even a scratch.  Both Billy
and John have nice bumps and gashes on their foreheads from hitting the
sun-visors and/or fresh air vents, but that's about it.  No one went to the
hospital.

Since they were only a few blocks from my house, they drove both busses over
here (with the passenger side door on the slider bungeed shut), and left the
slider in my lot.

Think that's bad?  Well, it gets worse...

John and Cindy are now stuck here with Billy to try and figure out how to
get home.  They manage to book a flight for Monday.  Well, when Billy went
in to work on Saturday, our friend Rick Babor tells Billy that he'll make
John a good deal on his '60 double-door standard.  So, John ends up buying
Rick's DD for cheap, provided that Rick gets the nice motor out of the
slider in trade. Sooooo....  Billy, John and Cindy are on their way over
here Saturday night to pull the motor out of the slider for Rick, and gather
various parts off of it that he wants to bring back home(such as middle
seat, new tires, etc.).  They get about halfway here, and the DD starts
pinging, knocking, shootin smoke, etc.  No oil pressure too.  (Did I mention
John is a VW dealer mechanic, and before they left he tuned up the engine
and tourqued the heads - which were loose?).  Well, the ENGINE IS BLOWN...
I get a call from Billy to rescue them, and we end up getting the DD towed
to my house.

So, the rest of the night is spent pulling the engine and good tires off the
slider, and then installing them in the DD so they can hopefully get home.
I don't know what kind of deal Rick is getting now that they had to use the
engine out of the slider though. (Most likely a RAW one though,
unfortunately).

What made the DD's engine blow you ask?  Well, when we got the engine out,
we found paper towels sucked up into the fan..(like the ones they have at
Rick's work)... that'll certainly do it, wouldn't you say?  Since all the
legs on the roof rack were broken off of the passenger side, we rigged it up
quick... snugging it down directly to the roof, and John and Cindy finally
pulled out of my driveway about 4:30 AM Sunday morning.

I gave them a good luck charm that served me well at one time... a glow in
the dark Casper figure that got me to the East coast and back a few years
ago with a bungee holding the bus in 4th...  I hope it serves them just as
well.

I don't know how they're doing..  I'll post again as soon as I hear
something if anyone is interested.
