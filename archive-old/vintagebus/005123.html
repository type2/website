Subject: Bus Sickness

I am there right now.  I want to restore my '67 kombi with a price tag of
$6500 for complete body work (got my estimate yesterday...get this, life
time guarentee on paint and rust.  He absolutely stands behind his work for
LIFE!).  I can't afford that.  I have two kids that are in braces, one heads
off to college in a few years, etc. etc. BUT I still sit here a think
&quot;Yeah...why not?.  Can I afford not to do it?  Short of an accident it would
guarentee that my kids will have this bus after I croak.  I wish I could get
vacinated or something but then what?  Boats?  Motorcycles?  Magic cards?
When you think about it there are worse sicknesses to have.  Most diseases
are not fun, but VWitis is OK.
