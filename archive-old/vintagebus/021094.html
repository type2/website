Salute Thom;

This is Tom and Sophie Fritz from Santa Clara.  We have a 1964 21 Window
Deluxe and we have to move from Santa Clara to Texas.  Once in Texas, we
would not need the bar...

We would rather not have to sell the 21 Window, but we can not seem to find
a good tow bar for the 21 window.

We have found a tow bar from a bug but my fear is that the start of a climb
up a hill will damage the bus, or worst, maybe spin us out of control.  We
will be using a 96 Eclipse (turbo) as a tow vehicle since it has tons of
power, and four wheel anti-lock brakes.

I have spent a lot of time to look for one, called around to the normal
suspects, but has not come up with a good tow bar.

Any clue?
