Subject: Re: [VB] Church Keys On Airplanes

Rob,
   A story I heard was a traveler was recently relieved of his disposable =
razor at the x-ray area. He walked down the concourse to his gate and =
stopped into a shop and bought another disposable razor!
   A church/bus hatch key might look like a tool to open an aircraft =
door/hatch/panel, don't blame 'em for taking a second look.=20

An insight to how the airline industry views security... http://www.thedail=

Here's a good link for rumor control... http://urbanlegends.about_dot_com/libra=

I like the phony &quot;final&quot; picture.=20

Last year when Erin and I flew in to Vegas to attend the Lake Havasu show =
I
dumped my pocket stuff on the little tray at the X-ray machine and the
ladies there asked about the church key on my key ring.  I told her that =
it
was to open the gas tank filler on a old split window bus.  She went and =
got
her supervisor and she asked me what it was for.  I explained to her and =
she
thought about it for a minute and then let me pass.  With the heightened
security I doubt if a church key is the kind of thing that you want to =
have
in your pocket.
Just a heads up to let you know.
