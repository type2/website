I recently picked up 2 newly rebuilt in-the-KYMCO-box 6 volt generators.
 These are Bosch, of course.  These include new regulators.  I don't need
them.  Anybody need a spare?

$40 each + shipping.

I figure like $10 shipping, they are pretty heavy. Someone let me know if
that is too low...

If anyone in Phoenix needs one I can bring it to the show this weekend.

I also have a couple extra 54-57 thin-slot generators, if anyone is doing
a correct resto.  Can provide month/year date codes as needed.  Prices vary
with condition.

Everett
