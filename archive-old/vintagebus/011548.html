I finally broke down and called about ordering a P.I.P westy style roof rack and discovered they are no longer making them and won't make any in the future. So that solves that. As for the NEATO help I'll be glad to give my time to speed the process up? I find the O.B.R invaluable. I also had luck tracking down the Glassurit paint mixing codes ( from original L-codes) through BASF's web site. I needed to mix L-73 and BASF had their rep. here in Vancouver give me a call, he looked up the codes and sent them to a local paint supply shop that carries the Glassurit 21 line. thats it.
