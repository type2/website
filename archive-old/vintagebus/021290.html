 Dear vintage listies,
     Me and a very good person, old friend and former roomy of my
 bro-in-law's spent most of the last two days attempting to put an early
 '66 trans. into his  '67 westy.  Well, the patient has rejected the
 transplant, it appears that the '66 came with it's drive shafts a total
 of about an 1.5&quot; shorter that they need to be.
 
 Friday we loaded the body and and former trans. onto a trailer with yet
 another David, don't remember any problem putting it in?
 
 QUESTION #1:  What is involved in replacing the drive shafts from the
 '67 with the reduction boxes from the '66? That's assuming we'll be able
 to get back in touch with the trans. &gt;&gt;

this doesn't mmake sense to me. driveshaft coming out of the bell housing is a
different length?   It should be the same - as you can put the same motorin a
crash box, later split case, tunnel case,or even those earlly 70s buses with
IRS trans.

Or do you mean the axles?    They did make some changes in the axle shafts,
but you could still use them onother year buses (3/55 through 67). Is the 66
tranny a reduction box bus tranny?  If it is a bug the axles are different.
