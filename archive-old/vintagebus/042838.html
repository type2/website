First potential problem I see is the duct tape.  A few years down the
road, chances are that your bag will come open. Duct tape ages, and
breaks down. Then it stops sticking.  Especially when exposed to moisture.

And a second potential problem (but then, one you'll have with anything)
is that the plastic bag itself will collect condensation on its outside,
and hold that against the metal.

Ok, ok.  It's a loose-loose situation, no matter how you go about it....;p

i'll shush now.;)
