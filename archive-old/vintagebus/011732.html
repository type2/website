&gt;1) Tranny has 4th pop out.  Hopefully I can rig it in for long Interstate
&gt;drive. 

Loaned my '67 to a friend one time, she drove from Atlanta to Deetroit --
4th got worse and worse during the trip -- one of her friends spent last
couple of hundred miles laying on the front floor, holding it in gear...

I hope your girlfriend is a *good* friend  (P.S. Take a couple of stout
bungee cords)
