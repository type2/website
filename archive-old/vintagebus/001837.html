Hi,

You might try adjusting the lash. There is a screw with a lock nut on
the steering box. It forces a follower pin into the worm gear. If the
adjustment screw is pushing too hard, tight steering results.

The screw should be adjusted for minimum lash and smooth action. Just
like any adjustable bearing.

Subject: [VB] Too tight steering


&gt;
&gt; Ever since I've owned my '57 bus the steering has been too tight.
It got
&gt; so bad once that it actually locked up on me and it ended up being
the
&gt; right spindle was froze on the king pin.  But now that I have new
dropped
&gt; spindles I thought that would solve it, but it is as tight as ever.
&gt;
&gt; When I say &quot;tight&quot; I mean that it is difficult to steer for one
thing, and
&gt; the steering doesn't &quot;return&quot; after turning a corner like most cars
and
&gt; type2s should.  I really have to reef on that thing to get it back
to
&gt; straight.
&gt;
&gt; Anyway, I was thinking it might be the steering box, but thought I'd
see
&gt; if anybody else has had this problem.
