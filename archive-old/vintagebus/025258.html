Subject: Which Vacuum Dizzy?
Message-ID: &lt;3737BC98.6832E8C1_at_worldnet.att_dot_net&gt;

List,

I have been reading the archives and I still can't find the answer I'm
looking for.

I want to replace the 009 distributor with a vacuum advance one. Here
are the particulars on the engine:

Case # H 5 290 255 - a (1968?) Type I 1500 rebuilt into a 1600 DP who
knows when, Carb - 34 PICT 3, 12 volt, stock exhaust and so on....

So the big question is, which vacuum dizzy should I be looking for? Part
numbers anyone? I realize that some of these are interchangeable from
year to year. Also, any pointers when looking through the used and
abused ones at the swap meets?

Thanks for your help!
