Subject: More Classic Pics

Yes I know I'm a bit late but here ya go. I have had a very busy summer
and have barely had enough time to do anything but work. So now I
finally got some pics uploaded (crudely) but there. See them at
http://hannoverwerks_dot_com then go to the events link and click on
Classic2000. Will have more to come! If you'd like to add to the site
I'll be glad to take all and any pics you guys have and or stories and I
promise I'll get them there sometime soon.
Later!
