Subject: [VB] Gas heater rebuilders
Message-ID: &lt;0.2f0246e2.2549d675_at_aol_dot_com&gt;

I have a complete under-dash style gas heater I would like to have rebuilt 
and installed in my Binz.  I know JB's in Colorado rebuilds them...is there 
anyone else?  Any guesses as to what a rebuild should cost me?  Turnaround 
time?

Thanks,
Dan
