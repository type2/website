Subject: Re: [VB] Bus Sightings

If you go to your local Chick-fil-A, they have a set of 4 cassette tapes to
go with the kids meal, and if I remember, two of them have a bus on the
cover.  I tried to get one last time I was there, but they were all out.
Don't know if they still have them, that was probably 2 weeks ago.  I'll
have to go back soon and check.

&gt; Also, if you have Hecht's in your local Mall. Next time go in and check
the
&gt; pictures in the Young Peoples department.  They're in the back of what
looks
&gt; like a 23 Window.
