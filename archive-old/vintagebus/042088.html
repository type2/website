3 calls in 3 days? Odd, considering I havent gotten but one call and a
visit from the Millars since the inception. Is it VW migration season?
1) Got a call from some young travelers from New York staying on South
Beach. Went visiting on sunday, 71 westy engine sounds a bit rough, like 3
cyl firing rough :(. They saw a mechanic today who said 'rebuild 1100' so
tomorrow they are off for a 2nd opinion from a pretty highly regarded shop
and well see how it goes. I have to be wary of a mechanic saying
rebuild 1100$ without suggesting a new engine possibility pr explaining
why in some detail. 
2) A pleasant girl with an 83 who is preparing for a trip to new
hampshire? and just wanted reassurance that things seem cool before she
takes off.
3) Just a few minutes ago some travellers in a 69 heading for key west
just asking about the area and crashing spots. May drop by on the
way back through (to Savannah) for a visit.

I guess like the Mortons salt slogan &quot;When it rains, It pours.&quot;
