&quot;So enough whining.  I have questions.  This is the second coil in 3
weeks.  
This time the points had closed a bit.  However, the common element I
can 
think of is the tachometer.  A Sunpro 2.5&quot;.  That's the only thing
that's 
been hooked up to the coils the whole time.  I removed a Pertronics unit 
thinking that had caused the last failure, returning to the way of the 
points.  Also, you may recall that just before the coil died the last
time I 
saw the tach needle oscillating wildly.  Only other thing I can think of
is 
the coil holder being loose might cause an erratic ground, causing
secondary 
winding failure (no didn't test the secondary windings before I
littered).&quot;

The coil doesn't really seem to be designed to be well grounded (paint,
stickers, etc.). I've seen Pertronics go bad, but not very often, and if
you've been running the points successfully for awhile, I think you
could rule that one out. I think the tach might very well be the
culprit.

I had a coil once short directly to ground, causing the ignition wire to
get very hot (enough to scare me, a couple of hours from home)... My
hero Dave R. had a spare...

Not a Guru, just another mechanic,
