We last left our hero in the arms of a blonde with wistful wanderlust
wunnung awound er going through his mind. 
After a heart rending departure, the Bus truddled southward to the
horntoad haven of that wide spot in the road called Coalinga. While
visiting a couple, his biker bro and Coasta Recian wife, they reminded
him that , ostensibly, he was responsible for their being together. All
he could remember was that his date canceled and he gave them 20 bucks
and told them to go on without him and &quot;have a good time&quot;. Anything that
a college grad and under aged latina spitfire did on their own time was
their responsibility and they would have to bear the consequence
themselves.
After stop in Mohave for gas and oil (der Black Forest elfs hide der
water fillum uppen un der volkswagen)  he left the motherland of
California for the vacum of  Arizona and the magic billboards of New
Mexico. The oil fillup proved to be over anctious as the forgiving bus
puked it's sump plate and pickup screen on an offramp to a Los Cruzes
Burger King, along with its entire load of oil. For one raised on the
mothers milk of Chevy V8s he was oblivious to the reality that he was
force feeding the poor little engine more oil than it would ever need.
After road side repairs and more Castorl GTX than nessary our 99cent
Wopper nourished, neophite traveled on.
