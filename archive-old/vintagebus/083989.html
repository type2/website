&gt;&gt;  Hey guys - I've just had an offer of the original engine  from a 67 - 
will that go right into my 60?  Assuming there were no  modifications to the 67 
and that I modify my bell housing to accept the 67  motor.  &lt;&lt;
Hi John,
Any engine from 1938-67 (as long as it is not a type 3 engine) will bolt  
right in.  Six volt bell housing does not have to be modified, if one uses  a 
200mm six volt FW.  The big problem will be making a mount for the remote  gen 
regulator or converting to earlier gen with mounted regulator
