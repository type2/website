Ok...Heres my new problem.

[Backround Info]
Yesterday afternoon out of nowhere, I felt the shifter &quot;tighten up&quot; if you
will.  It wouldn't physicly move into gear as smooth as it used to. Didn't
really think much of it. I was on my way home from work and approaching my
neighborhood.  I was taking off in first gear nice and slow from a stop
sign. I left the bus in first for a few feet, because the road ahead was
bumpy and rough. 


[THE PROBLEM]
I lifted off the gas while in first, and heard this terrible clunking noise
coming from the rear. Almost like if i were accellerating, breaking hard,
accellerating, breaking hard, only a lot more violent.  So I pulled over and
thought about it for a few.  This now happens in low RPM's in first gear,
and in second gear.  3&amp;4 don't have this problem, but there is quite a bit
of whining and other yucky noises.

[The Question]
I'm pretty sure I need a new tranny.  Where should I put my money?  I went
to my mechanic today. He said I probably need a new R&amp;P, maybe syncros,
bearings, gears, possibly redux bearings, the typical rebuild stuff I
suppose.  $800 for the worst case scenerio.  This includes remove and
install and it could be done in about 2 weeks.  He seems to know what hes
talking about, and I trust his work. (He also did my engine)  Now should I
have him do it? It is quite a bit of money, and I would have to leave my
only car in the shop for 2 weeks.  What is the difference between the pay
and go service he is offering, and a $500? tranny I can get from a catalog?
I hear the Rancho's are nice... I understand it takes a good deal of work to
remove engine, tranny, re-install, etc.  That would be where part of that
$800 goes.  Will a $500 tranny fix my problems? Is that all I need to
install and get back on the road again? Is there more to it than I'm not
seeing. I would rather spend $500 than $800 (duh) and am willing to do the
install labor myself (with Bently in hand).  Also would like to keep
downtime to a minimum!  The bus is drivable as is with plenty of babying.
(for how long? I have no idea)  Sorry for the length in this, I hope I made
some kind of sence.  Any and all suggestions are welcome.  Oh and no, I
don't race my bus or try to burn rubber, so this problem didn't rise out of
neglagence or bad driving habitts. Just old age i guess :-\
