&gt; First,  I keep reading that dd buses are rare (or atleast uncommon) but it seems like there are a ton of them around. Ronnie says there are 5 in Havasu, I know of 3 (including mine) in Houston, Thom even has one...

Heck, I got 2 for free November of 98!  DD panels are fairly common, and you're probably more
likely to see a DD panel running around than a 23-window.  Now DD windowed models - ie kombis,
standards, deluxes, are a bit rarer.

&gt; Second,  On the passenger inside latch of the first cargo door there is no handle, only a screw, no square thing to mount a handle to.... the drivers side cargos have handles on both. Should there be handles on all the doors? I know the pass side latch has a different # than the drivers side (well, diff letter 'A' vs 'C' I think)

Panels have different cargo door exterior handles.  Since it was a cargo-hauling vehicle,
- and not a passenger vehicle - there was no expectation of someone trying to get out of
one with the doors shut.
