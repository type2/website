&lt;&lt; The situation: My &quot;Certificate of Title&quot; states the VIN to my '63 as being
 7024040.  The VIN on my bus is accually something far different (988295).
 
 The big question: Does 702040 sound like an engine number?  &gt;&gt;
Hi Derrick,
Sure does!  According to &quot;Progressive Refinements&quot; chassi No. 970 990 had 
engine No. 6 916 251 built on 30JULY62.  Chassi No. 988 771 had engine No. 7 
020 161 built on 29AUG62.  So yours is a very early 63!  What would be great 
for you to get is the &quot;Birth Certificate&quot; from VW that would show the engine, 
chassi numbers, and Mcodes.  Several states used to use only the engine 
number for IDing a vehical.   Eric&amp;Barb
