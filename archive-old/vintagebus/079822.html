  someone   else do  it?

Hey Beto,

Why not just switch to big nut reduction boxes?  That
should give you just enough gearing to cruise at 70 or
so w/o much expense.  Heck, if I get a chance to
remove some, I'll give them to you.  I can cruise at
70 in my 1600/small nut in the '59 SO-23, but I
probably am winding out pretty bad.  The 1800/3.44/bug
4th gear set I'm using now does get me down the road
pretty well, even if the stroker lost me 3rd gear on
the earlier non-welded trans!

&gt; 205/75/15's this time around.  Wound out at 60-65,
&gt; but damn, accelerates like a bat outta hell! 
&gt; Contemplating keeping the stock tranny for the
&gt; acceleration, and around town driving. This bus is
&gt; my daily driver. I think I can deal with a 60-65
&gt; crusing speed.  We'll see after the entire inside is
&gt; dynamatted.
