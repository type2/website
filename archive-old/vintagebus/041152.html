Hey All,
Is the thermostat rod (the rod that connects the thermostat to the fan
shroud flaps)
the same in a doghouse shroud and a non-doghouse shroud ?
Are there different temperature range thermostats,ones that activate at
different temps.?
Anybody have a &quot;hoover bit&quot; they want to part with ?

Thanks !!!!!
