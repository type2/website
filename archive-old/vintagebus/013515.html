Hi, gang!

I've got a poser for you....

I've got a '65 13-window Deluxe Walkthrough and I'm yanking the stock 
interior panels that cover the metal panels behind the front seats and can't 
seem to do anything with the rivets. What do you guys do when you yank these 
without destroying the panel or deforming the metal beneath?

I thought of drilling, but am interested in hearing from you guys (gals) 
before I get rude with 34 year old metal.

All ears-

-EJ
