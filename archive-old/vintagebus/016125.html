&gt; I too was there early, It seemed like all the gold was bought/traded among 
&gt; the sellers before the public came in. like all those middle seats with sold 
&gt; signs on them. I did find some screw terminal bulb holders and early wiper 
&gt; arms for the 59 though.  Nice barndoor single cab in the lot.
