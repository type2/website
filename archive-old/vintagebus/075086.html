looks like Ronnie must have found some books to look this stuff up in.  whoo

hoo!  He doesn't usually quote chassis and part numbers.    So, did he dig 
them out of a dusty pile they have been in for years in his back room, or 
accidently run into them?

wow, that's really a mind trip.

&lt;&lt;   The handle changed to the recessed (indented style) somewhere in
 November/December
 1960 at chassis number 705 620 part number 211 837 205 D. Model year change
 was generally in August of 1960. Thus making yours a 1961 with the recessed
 ice pick handle, which was also used up till early/mid 1964.

 ps. Being E and B, and Clara are at the Vintage meets this weekend, I
 thought I'd post this to save them the trouble when they get home! &gt;&gt;
