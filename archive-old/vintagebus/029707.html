Subject: Bus resto update  (65 samba)

Just a quick update on where my resto project is.  (This is for a stock
65 Deluxe micro that i have been restoring for the last 3 years.)

Over the past 2 months alot has changed.  I got some new motivation in
the fact that i am getting married and want to use the bus as our
transportation.  Therefor i need to get it done inthe next 5 months.
(Gonna be close)  Anyway, i have made some good progress on the
interior.  I bought a set of S&amp;P seat covers from TMI and am working on
fitting these right now.  I also bought raw material to make door
panels.  The panels are 80% done right now and look great.  (Saved some
$$ too)  Next is to get all the interior trim polished and installed.

The seats need new stuffing so that is next.  Any recomendations out
there?  I got the wiring installed and 75% de-bugged.  I am having
trouble with the turn sig's and the dash pod lights.  (All of them)  I
have something crossed somewhere as they all come on or off at different
times when they are not supposed to.  I did design and install a
replacment 12V 65 only wire relay.  I also installed the stearing lock.
Lastly, i got hold of a new Engine case to build up the motor with.

Lot's to do though.

Anyway
Matt
