 True, the Bentley manual is a reprint of the original two-volume
 official VWAG Transporter Workshop Manual.  I started out with a copy of
 the Bentley reprint via JC Whitney (only $60), and eventually I was able
 to pick up each volume of the original (complete with grease smudges)
 via that unmentionable online auction site.  The original typically
 sells there for around $75 per volume, whenever one does appear.
 
 I've heard that story about the Bentley manual being an abridged version
 of the original (from no less a source than Bob Hoover, et al), but when
 I compared the two page-by-page I actually could not find much
 significant difference!

 &gt; As I understand it, the reprinted Bentley is an abridgement of some

 &gt; set, if it exists.

hm, the two volume set is thicker than the reprint.   The deal is that VW 
sent out updates everyso often, and the dealers put them in the binders.  So 
you find an old copy in the binder,  it may have several version of a page, 
with perhaps slight variations.    And you could thumb through them and find 
out the differences between 7/66 and 3/65 or whatever.  if you buy the 
reprint, it has only one version of each page.   
the real difference IMOPBO, is that the original have colour wiring diagrams, 
the reprint doesn't.  Also the originals can be pretty tatty. water damaged, 
etc.

seems that each copy of the original has a slightly different arrangements of 
the pages.   some can be missing, you know
