&gt; Pretty Cool Matt!
&gt;             Very interesting! I  am not sure if it is a Westfalia.It looks
&gt; more like a E-Z camper ( I say that because of the cabinet in the
&gt; foreground)

That could have been added at a later date cause is not of the same wood as the other
stuff

&gt; ,or a mix and match home set up.Maybe somebody modified a
&gt; Westy.But!! Some brighter pics of the interior would help!!!

On the way, I ran out of film ;)

&gt; Do the cushions
&gt; unattach and how??

The small table folds down and the front cushion slides over it to make into a bed.

&gt; Is there a closet just inside the cargo doors?

Nope. just the wheel arch

&gt; What kind
&gt; of wood would you say it is?Oak? Pine?Birch!!??

Just took a look at it again, it looks like a ply wood, a laminate two pieces of wood
sandwiching a soft core....
The paneling I'm not sure of the type of wood, it's about 1/8 in thick

&gt; What do the back cabinets
&gt; look like?

just a small cabinet, two doors with the hinges on the center post, about 8 inches deep
from floor to roof

&gt; Is there original material under the Hawaiian stuff?

Looks to be original, but there definitely is a cover on the seats

&gt; No curtain
&gt; rods?

no, there are some little spring thingies that look like they'd serve the same purpose.

&gt; Any propane appliances?

Nope, nothing at all like that.

&gt; Does it smell German in there?haha.

but of course! ;-)

&gt; It's cool
&gt; whatever it is.

Thanks

&gt;
