While I don't know what the spec in W for the headlights is,
you aren't going to have a lotta choices, like you do with the
12v ones.  I have seen headlights become more &quot;greedy&quot; as they
get close to the end of their useful life.

If you're not getting juice to the blinkies with the lights on,
that (to me) would indicate a separate problem.  

Try disconnecting the headlights themselves and seeing what happens.

&gt; What are the actual wattage specs for the 6V headlights (say, in
&gt; 1960)?  I think I've tracked my flaky blinkers down to not working
&gt; when the headlights are on, but the headlights don't seem dim.
&gt; Therefore, I suspect the bulbs themselves are pulling too much power
&gt; (although I'm going to clean up all the connections in any case).
&gt; Thus, I'd like to inspect the existing bulbs and make sure they're the
&gt; right ones.
