Subject: RE: [VB] Bus Sickness...POR 15

&lt;&lt;Zinc acts as a sacrificial anode on properly prepared bare metal
(blasted,
and metal prepped) Useless otherwise.&gt;&gt;

I am doimg my undercarraige in zinc chromate right now. And I think that
perhaps the POR-15 works a bit better than their disclaimer. . . at
least that is the word I got from a professional car restorer, who
swears the stuff chokes the rust out. Of course, he does his bets to
remove all of it first, but it can be reallly difficult to get it all.

But I also remember an old post, I think by Bob Hoover, in which he
stated that in the rust belt northern states, they spray their
undercarraiges with chain saw oil each year. That the chain saw oil has
a rust inhibitor built in to it and spraying it on ensures that it goes
in all the cracks. Of course, this sounds like it would also make it
disgusting to work on, but I guess there are tradeoffs in everything.

Also, as an aside. . . a friend of mine has a nice 1959 beetle for sale
in Maryland. It's a CONVERTABLE and he wants just $5,500 for it, which
seems like quite a deal. He is a mechanic, so it runs like a top. Has
just a few spots of &quot;surface rust&quot;. Top is in great shape and the
interior looks good too. I will be posting it on Ebay soom. . . thought
I woukl give you guys first crack at it.
