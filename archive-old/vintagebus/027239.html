ok...
wonderful evening here in WI...
this problem started 2 days ago....she got really hard to shift and
would grind gears whenever shifting.  I thought it was the clutch cable
stretching or breaking...so i adjusted it...no help.  I bought a new
clutch cable and bowden tube and adjusted them. no help. the old clutch
cable is perfect btw...   I adjusted it all the way down...no help at
all.  the clutch pedal is still too soft...and it doesn't pull the arm
on the trans far enough to disengage the clutch.  I have no idea
whatsoever as to what is happening.  The clutch and pressure plate are
new along with the throwout bearing about 2 months ago.  no problems
there.  it may be a problem up front with the pedal mechanism...but I
couldnt detect any problems.  I'm 100% stumped.  no manual will help me
here....I've looked.  and to top it all off tonight...when I was
starting it i pressed on the brake and blew a brake line.  GREAT!  more
money to plug into this thing.  It just so happens it blew inside of the
frame member...so I couldn't see where it was at first.....just
wonderful.  bye bye paint...hello rust!

any ideas?

I think stella may make a good storage shed out back.......
