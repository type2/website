Subject: Problems with Microsoft-related internet sites and services...

Several List members have inquired about problems with their Microsoft [MSN]
Internet connections and
e-mail services.

This is a link to a CNN story about the current problems with
Microsoft-related websites and Internet services including e-mail.

Seattle [Redmond] area media are reporting a situation that's much more
serious and extensive than this article describes.  Access problems began
nearly a week ago, and as of 11:00PM Pacific time Microsoft reports they
still do not know the source, extent, or true nature of this apparent
attack.  They report that the Hotmail e-mail service continues to be
inaccessible and the Outlook Express, etc., e-mail services are only
intermittently accessible.

OBC:  Some of us can't post or retrieve messages to/from the VW bus Lists.

FWIW.....
