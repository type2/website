I head off on the 30th to get the correct rear for my bus. The Bentley
manual states about supporting main driveshaft
while unit is on groud. I am confused at this point, if the reference is to
axle tubes and redux boxes? Will it be ok to have the trans attached to
axles and tubes/reduxes, while laying in my S10's bed, and then disassembled
in there _at_ home. I do not intend on using the trans,
rebuilt unit instead, just dont want to waste the axles. Is there something
I should ahve ready when I pick this thing up?
As far as rebuilds go, does anyone know if Rancho or other ships the entire
unit rebuilt assembled ahead of time? I am considering this avenue,
if possible.

Al
