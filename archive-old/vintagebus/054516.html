Subject: generator bushings.

for a while my bus has not been charging the battery.
i replaced the voltage regulator, checked the brushes,
and i was about to take off the pulleys whe i realized
that the belt spins freely of the pulley. it's too
loose. so i took out some bushings and tried to
tighten it up but i couldn't get it tight enough. in
the process, i broke a breaker bar and got a nice
raspberry on my head trying to tighten it. my question
is, do i need to ADD bushings between the pulleys or
take more out? there's only a couple in there now.
thanks a lot for you time.
