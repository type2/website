No only look like Bill Gates' crack head brother, feel

If I could afford a Land Rover I'd be there. No, we
are talking &lt;Toyota&gt; Land Cruiser, the vehicle that
makes a splittie bus look low maintenance. Not even a
cool FJ40 but a poop brown FJ60 4Runner looking thing
purchase based on price, number of doors, ease of
insertion/extraction of small childlike being(s) from
a baby seat &lt;there's a set up for a come-back if I
ever saw one&gt; and existence of A/C for the &quot;old man&quot;.
