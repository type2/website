 I am a little confused about this bus [or what's left of it!].
 This is a high hinge 60, correct?
 Why does it have fried egg turn signals?  Shouldn't it have bullets?
 &gt;

.........................
Nose job ?    But it does still have the pointy corned dash pod and thin 
edged package tray like a 60 should, so I would say just the nose skin was 
done.

hey those early kill your back walk throughs are rare!!!!
