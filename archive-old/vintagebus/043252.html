You bought lots of stuff, but not quite enough stuff!
There is an offset carb base that can be had.  What it does is it moves
the carb just enough to the left to free up the action of the accelerator
pump.  
It isn't very tall....maybe an inch at most, but the offset is probably
about 1/2&quot;.  Enough to do the job.
Break out the plastic Jim and go get ya one!
