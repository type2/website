Hi, I just wanted to say you can make some interesting bus stickers out
of the Bush campaign stickers. I changed my &quot;Bush for president&quot; sticker
into &quot;Bus resident&quot; . Maybe you could get 2 Gores and 1 Bush and make a
Go Bus Go sticker. A couple of buses ago I used to have a &quot; don't blame
me, I voted for bus &quot; one.

PS  Which by the way, I am voting for Bush and hope ya'll will consider
it too. Remember, Gore is an environmentalist who would love to see all
our beloved busses off the road by requiring stricter regulations, ie..
bigger government. Thanks ya'll.
