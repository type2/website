Subject: RE: [VB] Type 1 in a 74 bus

Ok,this is something I actually can relate to first hand.I rebuilt a 75 Brazillian Panel for a friend of mine it has a hangerbar like an upright powered loaf suspended by rubber mounts off the frame rail.The stock cooling tin for the upright is used but filler panels bolt to it so it mates to the body.

On monday I will post pictures of a stock 86 Bay Doublecab if it shows at the camping trip.It is powered by a 1600 Dp with a funky intake,looks like a singleport till it meets with an adapter at the head.

&gt;Make sure the engine is supported by more then just bolted to the transaxle.

Any suggestions on the best way to do this? I'm sure others have made this 
conversion and maybe somebody can give us some insight.
