Subject: Milk Crate Police

While looking at your pictures I noticed your use of Milk Crates, you
should note that on these it states &quot;Use by other than registered owner
punishable by law.&quot;
This is to confirm you are the registered owner? :-)

I also noticed you have some BIG VICE-GRIPS THERE BIG BOY!

Thanks for the encouragement for restoring busses that I would think are
toast and have given there souls to the vw heavens! Some day they will
be a 54RHD to someone!


Meredith
