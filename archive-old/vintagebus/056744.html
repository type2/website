 Hi Joe,
 It did go through!  We just did not respond due to vagueness.  Are you 
 looking to do really high RPMs, drag race or just daily drive?  For us daily 
 driving is it, so single Solex carb and otherwise pretty much stock engine.  
 Someday we want to improve this with a fuel injection system which results 
in 
 better torque through out the RPMs and still increases MPG!  Dual carbs are 
 much better for a bug or K Ghia for racing.

the engine i picked up is 2110    its got a couterwighted 82 mm crank
it is just the short block , crank and cam.
i got it cheap and in good shape , what i was thinking was of maybe putting 
in a milder cam and then going mild with the rest of the parts,  
just because its got the big bore and stroke shouldnt mean i have to go all 
out race with it right?
im thinking eventually to put it in my double cab
so im looking for low rpm but with the punch of the big bore and stroke
what carb setups do you think will feed this thing without over carbing it 
since it will be a daily driver in a truck.
in the cam i'll probaly call one of the cam makers and get the one they 
recomend for the low rpm and tourque.
