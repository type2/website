 Won't go into how great the event was, just want you to read a short letter
from a 13 year old girl and her sisters on how BBB effected them. Our
proceeds go to a local abused kids fund and this letter is about where some
of last years donations went. If you don't get teary eyed you're dead.

Dear Friends
 My name is Shannon and I am 13 years old. I have 2 sisters Stacy Sarah. We
came to Arizona in May to live with Grandma. My Mom is in prison for making
and selling drugs. Using too. My Dad is in prison for longer because he made
us have sex and hit us alot. My Grandma had to get a bigger house and buy
furniture for us before we could come here. It cost alot of money. My worker
said you guys helped pay for all this stuff. We are so happy to be here. We
also got to by new cloths, shoes,and even our own hairbrush. I never had my
own hairbrush. Then Christmas came. My Grandma said we could only have a
small Christmas because we had a little money. On Christmas eve our worker
brought turkey and lots of presents. We all cried hard. Stacy got her very
own bike and Sarah a scotter. I got a c.d. player and c.d.s. This has been
the best year of our life. You guys are our special angles. We thank you and
pray for you each night. When I'm older I am going to help kids like you
helped us.

Love Shannon Stacy Sarah

We thank every one of you who attended, donated, bought raffle tickets, and
bought auction items.

This is what it is all about. See you all next year.

John Howard and the London Bridge Bullis
