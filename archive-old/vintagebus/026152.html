To TF&amp;KLM,

&quot;press a rag over carb air intake of a revving engine until it stalls
do this a couple of times.&quot;

this is documented with accompanying illustration as a VW off road tune
up.
from that ubiquitous &quot;how to hot rod dune buggies&quot; (or something or
other) book.
This book was my first introduction to reduction boxes (there, bus
content!)

ps
by the way you guys really got under my skin today

from the home of the Tampa Buccaneers to the UH Rainbows spanning the
north american continent with Mississippi breakdowns and San Antonio
shake downs (and all those in-between kombi oakie tune ups) our hero
says good night to all F&amp;KLM and art bell listeners.
