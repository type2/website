It probably wouldn't hurt to pull the rocker arms off during this
procedure.  After you have cranked it for oil pressure, squirt plenty of
oil on the rocker assemblies,valves etc. re-install, check valve
clearances.  Double check oil level before running in the cam.  I even
overfill it.  As Kyle mentioned, don't use something like Castrol until
you get the rings seated or they won't ever seat. BTDT.  I used to use
Kendall 20 wt. non-detergent for the first few hundred, running it
gently then valvoline 30wt. non-detergent untill about 2000 miles, but
I've had trouble finding the Kendall oil lately.  At about 2000 miles 
Castrol goes in.
