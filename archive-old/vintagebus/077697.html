Subject: Re: [VB] RGB - 41mm socket needed

I got one for I think $10 at a pawn shop, with 3/4&quot; drive.   There is an inch 
size that fits too. Think I got the inch size.  I can check the socket for 
you if you want.  
 I didn't feel like paying big bucks for a new one (which I did for the big 
nut axle socket for some reason.) 

Make sure you have both inner bearings in place before putting the stub axle 
inner nuts on.  I forgot once, and had to undo the nut and remove the stub 
axle to get the upper inner bearing in.

:)

Hi all,
I'm just starting to re-assemble my RGB's, and I need to find a 41mm socket.  
Does anyone know a good source for the socket( or good alternative) for 
tightening these nuts on the short axles?
