&lt;&lt; I know this is probably asking for the impossible, but does anyone out 
there have a westy SO-35 interior they would be willing to sell?&gt;&gt;
We will keep an eye out for one for you.  So far though we know three others 
who are in the same boat as you.

&lt;&gt;
Wow, great!  It most likely had to be specially ordered from VW by the first 
owner.  Not a Vw that would have been found stock on the dealer floor after 
1962ish.

&lt;&lt;The partition behind the front seat was not a walkthrough, but not a bench 
either.  I think I saw a post awhile back about flipseats that they were 
converted from bench seat kombi's.&gt;&gt;
Well yes, and no.  The flip-seat front seat superstructure was a walk-thru 
swivel seat set up that had the flip seat installed in.

&lt;&lt;The partition was cut, and it was not a hack job.&gt;&gt;
Correct, definitely a factory job on all SO-34 &amp; 35s.

&lt;&lt;The bus also had a submarine hatch, and a mostly intact headliner. The 
westy interior is gone.  Tragic.  Another question, the tag from the engine 
bay reads:   23-35       1176847

Should stand for SO-35 Westfalia interior.  SO-34 was a Flip-seat interior 
with white formica interior cabinets, while the SO-35 was the same camper 
with the same cabinets in wood instead.

&lt;&lt;Anyone out there had any experience &quot;re-creating&quot; westy interiors?&gt;&gt;
Hmm, defintely could be done, but the $ is high unless you are a cabinet 
maker, or you had better learn to do it yourself.  Know one fellow who had 
his interior fabricated, and it looks original, but cost him over $2,000.00!

&lt;&lt; I wonder how hard it would be to rig up a flipseat for the front....  just 
thinking out loud.&gt;&gt;
Again anything is possible.  Though making the front seat is more of a likely 
thing you could do if you can find someone in your area to duplicate off of.

&lt;&lt;Any help on a flipseat interior would be greatly appreciated.&gt;&gt;
Okay dokay!  Eric&amp;Barb
PS we would like to get more info about your westie from the M-code plate 
that would have been under the front Flip-seat bench bottom, and include your 
bus in the Flip-seat registery.  EEE&amp;B
