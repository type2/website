&lt;&lt; &gt;&gt;hey Greg, why dont you get a parts list- there is even one online.&lt;&lt;
 
 Clara, where is that?
 
 Tom &gt;&gt;
I am responding to the list in case others are interested:
 
goto   http://home.cwru_dot_edu/~agw4/docs.htm

scroll down and click on the type II part resource.  It will show you a index 
with the preface bits, and  the main sections listed, search in section 8.  
the numbers in the parts list tend to be arranged by number in order

it has a mid sixties edition updated past 67.  Finding stuff can be 
difficult, as there is not much of an index on it, and there are many pages.  
go by the middle three numbers.    The first of them is the main section.   
section 8 is body  

the 841 section is &quot;door wings&quot;  (aka cargo doors)
(the 837 section is the cab doors, 845 is window glass and weatherstrips,  
etc)
 there are 7 pages in the 841 section

the 211 841 605 version is the barndoor one, and was still available at least 
through when my parts list was published, as it in there, and it

shows the 211 841 605D ( note the letter at the end- this is very important) 
version for the post barndoors (all) and 

so versions A,B and C, which were original at differnt point are NLA.

hope this helps.
