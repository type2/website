Subject: Re: [VB] Tips on removing petrified window seals?

Soak the frames in molten lava for 30 minutes.  The rubber will
come out like butter.

Failing that, take a sharp utility knife and cut at angles
down the channel, ie 'reaching into' the channel  This will reduce the rubber
to little strips which can be pulled out easier.

&gt; In particular, I am in the process of removing the 'window
&gt; frame to body seal' that runs around the outside edge of the
&gt; window frame.  The process I am using involves breaking it
&gt; up in to small pieces using a small screwdriver and a light
&gt; hammer and then picking the pieces out or sliding them to
&gt; the end of the channel an removing them there.  This is
&gt; quite a slow and tedious process.
&gt; 
&gt; If anyone has any advice for me that would make this process
&gt; go faster and easier I would sure like to hear it.
