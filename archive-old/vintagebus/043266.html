&gt;My experiace with NAPA is that the counter guys can be idiots.

That's anywhere, though.  :)  AutoZone/Pep Boys seem to have more of
them, though.._dot_usually you can find one guy who's been there a while
and knows to head for the paper catalogs if messing with the computer
doesn't prove helpful.  Seems like there is usually more than one
clue-enabled counter person at NAPA.  Also, they usually seem to be
a little more familiar with older cars like our VWs.

&gt;That being said, I have found that NAPA is REAL good about having parts 
&gt;other guys don't. But usually the price will reflect it.

They can be proud of their stuff but it usually tends to be good stuff.
It's hard to give any absolutes, but the NAPA stuff *usually* tends to
be the decent made-in-USA/Canada/Germany stuff instead of the 
made-in-China/Taiwan/Outer Elbonia stuff you get elsewhere.

Another thing is that at most NAPA stores, the guy punching up your
order has more control than you might think over what the bottom
line is going to be.  Once you've been shopping there for a while,
you may find that the prices come down somewhat.  Being nice to the
counter guy is also a factor here.  :)

I don't know if their distribution centers are one-per-large-city or
what, but here in Tulsa they had a warehouse with a parts store
across the street.  If you really needed it *now*, you went to that
store - they would sell it to you and you could pick it up yourself
at the will-call window over at the warehouse.  Now the warehouse
and the store are integrated, but still, you usually wait less if
you go to that store.
