Subject: Re:  [VB] Interior door panel Q (65 Samba)
To: mjhenks_at_deltanet_dot_com, vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

the cab and cargo area panels used the same system- grey above and below, S&amp;P 
in the middle.  this is material (rea vinyl leatherette) that is the same as 
the seats.   The panels got chrome strips inbetween the coloured sections.    
Think there was beading on top, will try to remember to check tomorrow.   No 
the S&amp;P panels (deluxe or not) were not painted onto the hardboard.  The same 
grey material was used for the ttrim panels for middle and rear seat.

(Funny enough, diff subject, some of the grey commercial panels wer painted 
grey, and some had material glued to hardboard.   Not sure of years, except 
the ones w/pockets I have seen were all painted, and some of the non pockets 
were each.)

or are you talking about the pieces behind the back seat?  In the luggage 
area by the rear hatch?  
..........................
Currently, I am under the impresion that the rear cargo area door panels
were the plain board w/ paint ona deluxe bus.  I have been looking at
some pictures of original bus interiors and am wondering if that is
correct.  Could it be that the lower hardboard in the cargo area had the
same material as the upper portion of the rest of the door panels?  This
would mean that it would also get the trim beading stapled to the top of
the panel.  Anyone????  I also think that the upper cargo panel (21
wondow) was not covered and was painted grey. (Grey S&amp;P interior)

Any help out there?

Thanks
Matt
