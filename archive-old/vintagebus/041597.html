Subject: Gas tank vent Q
Message-ID: &lt;Pine.BSF.4.05.10004050716150.29886-100000_at_lenti.type2_dot_com&gt;

On my 68, 69 gas tanks there is a vent tube on top that runs to a spot
in the filler door (i guess it goes to a charcoal cannister in later
years) but the Q is if I am using one of those tanks does the cap still
need to be vented or were the vented caps for some years when the fuel
tank had no venting system of its own. Im going to jam an early loaf tank
into the 64 as well. Where have you folks routed the tank vent to in that
case?
gracias
