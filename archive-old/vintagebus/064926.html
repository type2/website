&gt; Hey Y'all,
&gt; I've got a 1600 DP here with an alternator conversion an it is not charging
&gt; the battery. Battery is confirmed good. So 2 questions, How do I test an
&gt; alternator, and secondly, The alternator has 2 terminals, one marked B+ and
&gt; the other marked D.  The B+ obviously goes to the positive side of the
&gt; battery, but my question is: Should there be a wire going DIRECTLY from this
&gt; terminal to the battery or does the wire from this terminal go to the starter
&gt; solenoid where it is attached at the same place as the positive battery cable?

Either arrangement is the same.  It really depends upon whether the
starter or battery is easier to wire from the alternator.

The thin wire from the alternator goes to the idiot light.  This circuit
has to be intact and the bulb good for the battery to charge.
