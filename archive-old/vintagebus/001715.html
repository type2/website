&gt; If anyone has one that will fit a bus, I need one for the '66 hippy van
&gt; so I can play my 8 tracks that I have kept all these years.


8-tracks deteriorate with age much more severely than cassettes do. Unlike
cassettes, they used a lubricant on the reel within the tape cartridge
itself, which has likely dried up after all these years.  Meaning that once
you find a way to play your old 8-tracks, you may be very disappointed with
how they sound.  Then again, I suppose that considering that they're
8-tracks, you weren't exactly expecting CD quality anyway. :-)
