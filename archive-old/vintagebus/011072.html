&lt;&lt; The list   Is there any way to install the vent window rubber without
 taking the vent out of the frame?  Does VW sell the rivet needed?   &gt;&gt;
Hi Jon,
It depends on which seal you are talking about.  The body to the wing window 
frame then yes!  The rubber between the frame and the glass will only install 
if previously pressed into place so it has the proper shape.  Otherwise you 
have to remove it and press the glass and rubber in with a special fixture.  
As for the rivet all you need is a solid metal rivet of either aluminum or 
copper.  Just make sure to install a phenolic fiber washer between the wing 
window and bracket on the door window frame!   Eric&amp;Barb
