Subject: More Electrical Problems

Argh! I had everything working and then I made the big mistake of taking all 
the wires off the fuse box cause I wanted to clean the cab floor with a light 
hose spray of water. Thought I wrote down where everything went, but 
evidently not correctly, cause now some stuff isn't working.

1) I have only high or low beams not sure which). When I pull out the light 
switch one click, dash lights and small bulbs in headlight come on. When I 
pull out another notch I have headlights. When I step on the dimmer switch 
the headlights go out. When I step again, they come back on. So I have either 
high or low beam (not sure which it is) but not both. 

2) No turn signals. I have a German 3 pring relay that worked before taking 
the fuse box apart. One wire to fuse, one to turn signal switch on column, 
and one ground. 

Any idea where I should begin to look for the cause of these problems? As I 
say, all was working well before I took wires off the fuse box and cleaned 
the cab floor.
