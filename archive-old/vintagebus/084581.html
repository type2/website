Subject: Re: [VB] re:weird 28 pict

I've run a 28 pict on a 1600 sp in a bus, and liked it.  In fact a couple years ago swapped to the 28 from a so pict, and got better gas milage, though the acceleration was different than with the 30.  A bit less pull at lower rpms.    Doesn't run hot... I have oil temp guage.  
I think they were designed for a 40hp, but I have had no issues with one on a 1600.  My first bus has one, and it got 31 mpg regularly.   For 3 years.
