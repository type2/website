&gt;Styling reminiscent of the 50's-60's Microbus designed to attract Phish

fans who've grown old enough to have their own families&quot;

Man, are those blockheads out of touch!  The irony of that statement is
overwhelming.  I am supposed to be exactly who they are talking about
(Phish fan, small family, &quot;grown up&quot;, etc).  However, because I love,
respect and use a product(my buses) they created so well many years ago,
I have no desire to buy one of these overdone beasts now.

That is, unless they actually listened to and supported all of us who
drive around  in 23+ year-old rolling advertisements for what they used
to be about, and dropped the price by about 20 grand.   I saw a couple
drawings done by bus fans, which took the current prototype, and just
changed some external styling, which almost made the new one
interesting.  One was in one of the popular vw rags, but I can't find
it, here's another one:
