 Hi Wayne.
I have been to factoy tours of both Wolfburg and Hannover plants.  I was in Hannover last summer for EXPO2000 and to visit other Leskes.  We really enjoyed the the tour of the VW Nutzfahrzuege Fabrik. It was very interesting to see the whole process.  Even the wife enjoyed it.  VW started building Transporters there in 1956 but there is very little vintage to see there.  They did give me a 50 year anniversary magazine (in German) and some vintage postcards that were really cool.  I also bought some coffee mugs there with vintage bus pictures from early adverts.  Watch the new transporters being built and bask in history of the building that your bus was built in.  Tell the guides that you have an old Bulli and you may score some extra goodies.
While in Wolfsburg be sure to tour the factory.  The museum is not on the grounds but north and east of the factory and across the river. (that was 2-3 years ago)  VW has since constructed a new museum called Autostadt (www.autostadt_dot_de) that may be worth a look.  
Let me know how much spare time you have and I can give you some travel pointers, as I have been to Hannover a few times.  If you have time, go to the Harz mountains and if you are into military history there is a wonderful Panzer Museum in Munster.  www.panzermuseum_dot_com  I am not so enamored with Hannover itself but there is so much near there that is nice.  If you like mediaval half-timbered villages Celle or Hameln is only a train ride away.  If you go to the Harz you should rent a car, go to Wernegerode, in the former DDR, and ride the narrow gauge steam railroad through the Harz.
I hope that helps...Oh I almost forgot ...there is a Bullimuseum in Salzgitter.  I have not been there but it mostly looks like bays from what I can see on the web.
Paul

Because of business I have the opportunity to go to Wolfsburg and Hanover in
Germany. Does anyone know which one has the vintage tours or vintage
museum?
