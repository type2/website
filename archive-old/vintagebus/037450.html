This kamperbus article I came accross for my 56 westy quotes:

&quot;But when you go to get dinner, everything is at hand. A camp stove of your 
favorite type comes out of the engine compartment, where there was more than 
enough room for it; your&quot;

Stove in the engine compartment?????????
Huh?
Any thoughts?

Thanks!
Greg
