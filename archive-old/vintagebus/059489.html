Subject: Re: [VB] Daily Driver Poll/Bus Sighting :p

&gt;i know the &quot;bus sightings&quot; were more out of excitment, but if i did that every
&gt;time i saw a bus, i'd never be able to stop typing.

Split busses are VERY RARE around here. Because of me there are now a 
few more in town. But none of those are even on the road right now. 
And all my others are non-running too. So it's just my lonely '59. A 
bus sighting is usually one driving through town. Very rare, but VERY 
cool when I, or someone I know, sees one.
