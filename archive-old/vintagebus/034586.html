have access to this material for free.)  This person was not charging for his

this act of kindness constitute &quot;an act of theft&quot;.  Secondly, how does such an
act have a &quot;natural outcome of this abuse has been to squelch such

Steve,

You see it wrong.  And I should not have to explain.  But...

Obtain and read a copy of the Copyright Act (as variously amended but be sure
to include the most recent [1997] 'NET' amendment [ie, 'No Electronic
Theft']).  My material was posted to a publicly accessible archive and, with
my permission, to mirror sites in other countries.      

What you have termed a 'convenience' is in fact an act of thievery.  Just
because material has been publicly posted does not mean it falls within the
definition of material within the 'public domain' (ie, material NOT protected
by copyright).  Without the permission of the owner you may not legally
reproduce, duplicate, distribute or publish copyrighted material.  I know it
sounds a bit picky but it happens to be the law, just as you are not supposed
to steal other people's cars or children or money.  

Try applying your version of reality to books in a library, material published
in a newspaper or a song you've heard over the radio  Each of these
constitutes 'public posting' of copyrighted material.  You did not create the
material.  You have no rights to it other than as an end-user.  Except within
the narrow provisions of the law, you have no right to duplicate, publish or
distribute without the consent of the owner.  Nor does the fact the author of
such material made no effort to profit from it give you the right to do so.

As to the 'natural outcome' of such theft, see the archives of the Vanagon
mailing list and the cute  &quot;Permissions Reminder&quot; they now tack to their
subscription notice.  But you should also check the stats for such Lists.   

It's a sad thing to see a Volkswagen burn up or to hear about some kid losing
his brakes on a hill or having his 'new' engine blow up.  I've tried to help
those people and for the most part, they found that help useful.  But then
there are the other sort, people without any sense of honor or fair play,
people who are always willing to prey upon the kindness of others. One does
not consort with such people, other than to eliminate them. 

What I write belongs to me, legally and morally. If you want to distribute
something to your friends as a 'convience', write it yourself.  That way you
won't be breaking any laws and I won't come gunning for you :-)
