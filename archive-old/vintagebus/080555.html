Subject: Re: Re: [VB] re:Vintage v Type II

I've been on VB for awhile now and have been posting a lot on thesamba, but 
I do keep up with the VB list.  It is a lot shorter than it used to be.  
When I first joined, if I didn't keep up with it during the day, I would 
never get through all the posts when I got home in the evening.  I remember 
everyone saying the same stuff about flaming on vb and they only subscribed 
to the digest.  The VB list has much better content though.  Quality not 
quantity.
