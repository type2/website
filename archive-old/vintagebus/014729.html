Well Thom, I agree with that. You get it cheap but in the end you end-up
spending more. Isn't it the same with newer cars? These days you pay
$20,000 for a used car and then end up spending additional $1,000 on new
power steering pump, $500.00 on a new pair of seat belt buckles, yes!!!!
$500.00 for seatbelt buckles!!!!, $400.00 on a new radiator. Do you want
me to go on? You end-up spending a lot more. Older cars we can fix
ourselves 90% of the time, newer ones what? 25-30%??? Don't you agree
with that? My main thing here is that cars no matter how expensive or how
cheap are going to need our attention, cars will break down once in a
while. Working on a bus is not just because we have to drive it. We do it
because we love it and it gives us that great feeling that we've done
something ourself. It's pride. It's not just a car or a van,,,,,,, It's a
Volkswagen!!!!
