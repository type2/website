&gt; size is 18x1, and the left side has a left handed thread (reverse than
&gt; normal &quot;righty-tighty&quot;), so to die the fronts, you'd need two different
&gt; dies.
&gt; baum tools, although pricy, sells all the larger size taps and dies for all
&gt; those weird vw things, such as spindles, rear stub axles, etc.
&gt; their phone number is:  1-800-848-6657, or http://www.baumtools_dot_com
&gt; i don't have a jobber account with them, or i could maybe help as far as
&gt; prices and ordering, but my guess would be in the $40 range each for the
&gt; dies for the front spindles.
&gt; good luck.
&gt;

&gt;&gt; Any help would be appreciated.  I took off my drums today to check my
&gt;&gt; cylinder, and the previous person who did this mangled the threads when
&gt; they
&gt;&gt; put it on.  Now I need to, if I can, find a tap for the spindle to try and
&gt;&gt; repair the threads or replace the whole spindle.  Does anyone know what
&gt; the
&gt;&gt; thread size is on a 67 front end spindle and if I can buy that size tap?

Thanks for all the help.  Mr. Metric is here in town, I think I'll call them
tomorrow to see if they have that dye and nut.
