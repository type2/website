Hi Issaiah,

Okay, i heard the deal you were offered and i didnt think it was that
bad... No gain but no loss anyway.

The deal i remeber was that Mr. X offered to trade you straight up a DD
middle seat in good shape with a different color of upholstery for your dd
middle seat with the color of upholstery he needed.

You wanted him to trade you a sloped roof rack AND his dd middle seat for
yours.  With a sloped roof rack going for 1k plus, i think The other party 
would have been ripped off on that one... Slightly better upholstery isnt
a 1k premium... (or is it? this market is whack lately!)

Thing is, he had a buyer lined up for his seat that needed that exact
color to finish his 23 window... and the buyer is desperate.  You
quite possibly could have made more money selling the other one. (Mr. X
cant sell it because he needs it for his bus.)

take care,

Steve &quot;setting the record straight&quot; White
