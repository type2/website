&gt; But, I took the old oil bath out and it looks totally Jurassic inside.
&gt; There is a cake of gunk in the bottm, which looks like clay. The top of the 
&gt; honeycomb compartment is all dusty, and it looks like the horsehair in 
&gt; there is
&gt; nasty.

Hi Jason,
Sounds like someone never bothered to clean out the debis in the bottom!

&gt; How long do these things last?

As long as you do not apply fire, sandblasting, acid or salt water to it.

&gt; I read the cleaning instructions in the library. Seems like you use 
&gt; Kerosene?

Correct if it is really grungy as your's sounds.

 Does this horsehair compartment &gt; come apart?

No, it will clean some with the kerosene and continue to clean with the 
action of the oil filtering air through it.

&gt; Finally, is this even the correct cleaner for my 67 Bus?  The bottom 
&gt; &quot;bathtub&quot; is about 7.5&quot; across, with the spout coming out with the weighted 
&gt; flap and a 1&quot; outlet near the end. The part markings are: 1GM 4087S 211 129 
&gt; 613 B

That one is for a Bastard 40HP engine and possibly very early 40 HP.  Which 
will run your engine too rich unless jetted especially for it.  Check the 
obsolete air cooled files through Thom's vintagebus webpage for the bus parts 
manual and see the aircleaner you need there.
