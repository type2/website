Subject: [VB] 12v flasher conversion complete

I just finished the installation of the KYMCO 12v flasher conversion that I
ordered from Ronnie.  I didn't realize that Kymco carried such a thing but
of course, Ronnie did.  It's kind of a pricy little gizmo - it consists of 3
big diodes and two three way flashers to complete the deed.  When it comes
right down to it, the parts could be had for a song so in reality, you are
paying for the brainiac that figured out how to convert from the old 6v
system to the 12v system with off the shelf parts.  I'm contemplating on
writing up a schematic and a how-to article but something about doing it
seems unethical.  I mean, I paid money for this gizmo and by posting a
schematic, it kind of hurts future sales on Ronnie's and KYMCO's part.

At any rate, the conversion went really smooth - it's an A-1 kit that
installed with nothing more than a couple of strong fingers, a phillips
screw driver, and a pair of pliers for when the fingers weren't strong
enough.

I finished por15'ing the headlight buckets and the rear apron and they are
just starting to get tacky so I'm headed out to K-Mart to buy some dutchboy
rattle can primer.  They've got it on sale for 75 cents a can.  Hard to beat
that price!
