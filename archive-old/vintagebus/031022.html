Subject: Re: [VB] Repro Rubber for EMPI steps?

Which brings up a question I've been saving -- on my set of EMPI steps
the globe-shaped pads are offset from the center of the pad bracket. 
And since both of my steps are identical, this means that the pads
appear assymettrical when installed on my DC's bumper brackets.  That
is, on one side the pad is slightly forward from bracket center and on
the other its slightly behind center.

Is this the way it's supposed to be?  Are both steps in the set supposed
to be identical?  Or the person who did the original installation screw
this up?
