Subject: Re: [VB] Questions about the metal fuel line to fuel pump in
  1600DP

http://www.wolfsburgwest_dot_com/wolfsburg_new/fuelsystem/index.cfm
   
  Wrapping your line with a rubberband, innertube or piece of gum is not a good idea. Why not do  it they way you should. The above should help you to see how.

  I had not planned to remove the motor (1600DP w/ doghouse
cooler), but a broken exhaust stud changed that. Now I am planning to
re-install my motor, I am thinking about improvements I would like to
make. One &quot;improvement&quot; I would like to make is to install the stock
metal fuel line that goes from the front (FIF) of the engine tin around
the fan housing to the fuel pump. I once bought a metal fuel line that
was supposed to serve this purpose, but I could not figure out any way
to make fit on my motor.
I know that the place where the metal fuel line passes through
the front tin is an historic problem area, but I believe that there are
adequate fixes for this (Bob Hoover had one involving lamp parts and, I
think I recall that veewee111 recommends wrapping the fuel line w/
bicycle inner tube). I think that, in the event of an engine fire, I'd
rather have metal fuel line running through the engine compartment.
Anyway, I have never seen a motor in person or detailed pictures
with this fuel line installed. I have two questions:

1) Are there any detailed pictures anywhere showing this fuel
line installed. I vaguely understand that it bends around the fan
housing. I don't understand exactly how it is routed. Did the location
of the hole in the front tin move over time? I don't understand how the
metal fuel line connects to the fuel pump.

2) Does anyone sell this metal fuel line with the correct
shape for the doghouse cooler? Is there a different shape for doghouse
coolers?

Thanks for your help,
