&gt;
&gt;So I took the sender out of the tank and hooked it up to the gauge with
&gt;new jumper wires, stuck a coat hanger in one of the holes in the bottom
&gt;and cycled the float with no action at the gauge. The gauge sat at 1/1
&gt;the entire time and I could hear and feel the float going up and down.
&gt;So it looks like a new sender eh.

Pretty likely.  As long as you're sure your ground wire was touching
bare metal on the sender, then it sounds like your sender is bad.

Unless you bought it from someplace that lets you return electrical
stuff, you probably don't have anything to lose by trying to take the
sender apart.  If it's welded it might be interesting but sometimes
things like this are riveted or held together with tabs.  I'd guess
that the wire is broken off of the hot terminal, or the wiper that
goes between the coiled wire and ground isn't making good contact.
You might be able to bend the wiper or solder the wire and fix it.
