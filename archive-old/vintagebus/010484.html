 &gt;     Back on the subject, my working fuel gauge does that exact thing!
&gt; &gt; It reads empty when I actually have half a tank left.  I replaced the
&gt; &gt; original tube sender with a floating arm one.  Does anyone have this
&gt; &gt; problem with aftermarket senders that don't reach all the way down into
&gt; &gt; the tank?  Has anyone bought an accurate aftermarket sender that reads
&gt; &gt; accurately?  Can I bend it a little so that my gauge can be more
&gt; &gt; accurate on the lower half of the tank instead of the upper when I know
&gt; &gt; I'm o.k. on fuel???  ---J.D.

I'm using a baywindow tank and baywindow sending on my 67 bus.  I can fill
the tank (all 15 gallons) and it registers full on my VDO Royale guage.
Within about 50 miles I'm down to 3/4 of a tank and as within a 100 miles
I'm down to 1/4&quot;.  The guage sits on 1/4 for a long long time and then once
I start getting critical, it starts diving towards the E mark.  It was a bit
un-nerving at first but I've gotten used to driving on 1/4 tank for a long
time.  If I fill the tank on on the 1/4 mark, it hold about 7 gallons.
After awhile you figger it out...
