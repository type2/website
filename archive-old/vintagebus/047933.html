Subject: too Cke or not to Coke?
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com


Oooh, this doesn't sound like a good idea, for the following reasons:
1. Coke can generally be used as a cleaner, I suspect it would be
detrimental to the mat.
2. 

If the other stuff is cheap and works why take a chance on Coke. plus whenever
i spill soda on my mats it just makes a sticky mess, i guess you would have 
to wash it all off, because of the carmel.
any way to the point of this letter:   someone once told me if you are 
washing work close that are oily or greasy put a little Coke in the washing 
machine and it will take the oil and grease stain out.
i wonder if i wash my hair with it if it will cure baldness?
