&lt;&lt; Could the fitting of a bay window clutch damage the gearbox? If so, 
 to what extent? &gt;&gt;
Hi Mack,
If it was not adjusted correctly it would cause the clutch not to completely 
engage or dissengage.  The former would cause slipping and loss of power and 
the latter would cause hard shifting and much wear and tear of the sycromesh, 
and gears.

&lt;&lt;On the second breakdown, did the gearbox actually fail at all - or was it 
merely the same problem as the first breakdown - the cause of which may not 
have been rectified?&gt;&gt;
Without being able to see the parts we could only guess that it was the 
clutch again going bad.

&lt;&lt;Do the symptoms described for the first breakdown tie in with the engine 
mounting bolts dropping out? Would this result in damage to the original 
clutch, necessitating its replacement?&gt;&gt;
If the engine mounting bolts had dropped out the first time you pushed on the 
clutch the engine would have tilted back and downward and the clutch pedal 
pressure would have pushed out the engine.
 
&lt;&lt;The garage maintains that it did not replace the clutch cable, yet it was 
apparently the correct length prior to the clutch being replaced and too long 
afterwards (it had been shimmed to try and reduce the  effective length but 
was still too long). Why could this be?  &gt;&gt;
As a best guess is that your original clutch cable was stretching toward 
breaking.  So this caused you to glaze the clutch disc due to not entirely 
disengaging the engine from the tranny.  Causing less fiction and slipping of 
the clutch components which feels like less power.  So they may have replaced 
the clutch parts and installed a cable of too long of length, or if the cable 
was too long to begin with, and left that way the clutch disc and pressure 
plate would end up in the same condition as before.
