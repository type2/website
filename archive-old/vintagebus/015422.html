Objection!  

Sustained.  The list is instructed to disregard that last remark and

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Hah! Thats a laugh. Lawyers in buses?
&gt; &gt;A lawyer would most likely spontaneously combust in a karma-rich
&gt; &gt;environment like a split screen vw. 
&gt; 
&gt; I take umbrage at that! As a lawyer and the owner of two splitties, one 
&gt; beetle, and a Karmann Ghia, this comes perilously close to slander, and I 
&gt; will take the appropriate action! :)
