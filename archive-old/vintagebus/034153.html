If you feel like makeing a drive VWhoward and I found a 66 deluxe with a
perfect nose on it, It's out where I bought my single cab, The gentalmen
that owns the bus will only sell it whole, theres not much left on it but
the body is really straight, anybody interested in this pmail me and we can
meet up when I go to pick up the single cab and  then cut the deluxe up&gt;

Hi All,

Still need that elusive passenger door hinge pillar. Any of
you guys goin to Pomona that brings one, I will take a
serious look. I will also look at whole nose pieces.

Richard, I am still interested if you have a really good
one. Its just that if  I can't  soon find one out here, I'll
buy yours.

First one to show up with the goods gets my business.

Chris
