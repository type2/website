&gt; Subject: [VB] Dying at stop lights
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Greetings, O Cool List ... another question for ya...
&gt;
&gt; My bus' engine, a new engine (A.D. 2000), always running great
&gt; for the past
&gt; year, year and a half, never abused... temp gauges.. warmup...
&gt; textbook down
&gt; the line.. is now suddenly running like crap and, worse, dying at stop
&gt; lights.
&gt;
&gt; God, how awful is that, to get these curiouis looks -- and then the thing
&gt; doesn't run, hasta be re-started at an intersection.
&gt;
&gt; Great. Dead VW bus at a stop light. Perfect target. It should be illegal
&gt; (the honking horns, not the VW bus).
&gt;
&gt; Idle is way, way too low, out of the blue.
&gt;
&gt; Alright, alright, I know. The idle is, of course, promptly
&gt; adjusted.  But it
&gt; runs great for a day, maybe two -- hell, four -- , then it's back to being
&gt; too low, where I have to do the foot-switchcaroo deal -- and gun the thing
&gt; to keep it from dying when I come to a stop. Definitely not safe.
&gt;
&gt; It's also begging to die to when I start from a stop unless I
&gt; give it extra
&gt; gas.
&gt;
&gt; It starts right back up, of course. &quot;Who? Me?&quot;.
&gt;
&gt; Here's the Twilight Zone: As far the carb goes, the two screws used to
&gt; adjust the carb seem to be in the same positions they were when they were
&gt; last adjusted, which corrected this... for a day.. and they're not
&gt; particulary loose.
&gt;
&gt; Insight? Without the nee-ni-nee-nu nee-ni-nee-nu of the TV series?
&gt;
&gt; The help I got on the directionals (previous) was OUTSTANDING.
&gt;
&gt; (WTC Note: I sincerely apologize to the members of this list for actually
&gt; posting extremely emotional sentiment for the participants to
&gt; endure. While
&gt; it either inflames hurtful derision or solicits much-needed
&gt; support, it does
&gt; not contribute to the function of the list . Like most, I just vented
&gt; irrespective of the forum -- but I did not intend nor do not now, nor ever
&gt; so, to vent at the expense of alienating anybody, right or left
&gt; (politically).
&gt;
&gt; (This is a great list. Its members, you, me, automatically have at least
&gt; that one thing in common. Thus apologies and respect offered.)
&gt;
&gt; Just answer my question, DAMN IT!
&gt;
&gt; ; )
&gt;
&gt; Craig.
