&gt;    I have a genereal question about the front window sizes. Is 1955-63
&gt;different than 1964-67? I am looking at a pair of safari windows that are
&gt;for a 55 thru 63. I didn't think there was a difference. Anyone in the know
&gt;on this.

Stock glass size is no different, but the safaris windowss are a 
different size.
Look at a 64 - 67 window frame. ATt he top there is an indention that 
the earlier windows don't have. That indention is where the safari hinge 
rests. The 64 =67 are that much bigger that the 55 - 63 ones. This is 
all OG safaris. The aftermarket one are somewhere in the middle to make 
a happy medium. I have OG late safaris in my 56 Panel, and the bottoms 
would always rub on the bottom of the window frame. Found a set of 
earlier ones and the problem went away...
