Subject: Gas Heater Seminar update

Put it on your calender, Sunday February 18, 2pm in Kansas City, a gasoline
heater seminar sponsored by the local chapter of NEATO, the Kansas City
Kombies.

We still have not nailed down an exact location for the seminar, but we
should this week.

I have a number of gas heaters of various types to show, they include South
Wind - bug, type 3, bus in engine compartment with duct work and bus under
dash model.  We also have a complete Eberspacher heater for a bus that
includes all of the needed duct work and controls.

We will have a running gas heater on a stand along with one that can be
disassembled to show the various parts.

This past weekend, I was working on some nice stands that will hold the
heaters and allow me to rotate them as we explain the parts.  I love to
design and build from steel (farm boy ingenuity).  I think you will like
the stands I have designed.  The stands make working and handling a gas
heater much, much easier.

We will have both the South Wind and Eberspacher manual copies available.

This seminar should prove to be a lot of fun along with some good
information.  After the seminar, we will caravan to a local restaurant for
those that have time.

A number of people have asked me to video tape the seminar, so I will try
to have a camera set up as I do in the lab when I am demonstrating.

We may even have a few fly in (Kansas City International is close to the
meeting), we can arrange for transportation and lodging.  As far as we
know, no where else in the world is anyone doing a seminar on gas heaters,
so plan on attending!!
