I had that type (12W) bulb in mine and I think it took about 20 min to see 
any appreciable melting.
(I had a partially melted lens to experiment with) Course I wouldn't use 
these bulbs on a regular basis as Plastics do weird things when subjected 
to repeated high heat encounters (i.e. cloud up, get very brittle....)

&gt;Well, I haven't left it on long enough yet, but it makes the whole
&gt;assembly pretty darn worn if you leave it on for, let's say, 5 minutes.
&gt;I don't have covers on all of them yet.
