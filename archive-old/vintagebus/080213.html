Subject: Re: [VB] Excessively stiff clutch pedal

Paul,
The pressure plates vary as to which one you have.
Our stock is soft but our Kennedy 1700 lb. requires MORE effort.
Sounds as if you do not know what pressure you have???
Now to I.D. you pressure plate?

Still in the PNW

&gt; I have a 66 split bus that I fitted IRS to 18 months ago using a type 3 box -

&gt; It had its original box, but with a 1200 engine in with a 180mm clutch - which
&gt; I don't remember being that difficult to use.
&gt; I then fitted a 1600 that had sat outside for a while, and the pressure plate
&gt; was a bit rusty - the clutch was tough to engage - but I just put that down to
&gt; the fact that then PP was rusty.
&gt; Now I have just fitted a type 4 engine with a brand new 215mm pressure plate -
&gt; and the clutch is still just as difficult to engage.....
