Subject: New Air-Cooled VW Forums!!!!

Hello!
  
  I just wanted to let you all know about the new Volks Folks Air-Cooled forums. You can visit them by going to:
  
  http://volksfolks.forumwise_dot_com/
  
  These forums were created on May 16, 2006. As of yet they don't have  any members or posts. I'm hoping to change that by getting the word out.
  
  I hope this can become a place, like this e-mail list, where us VW nuts can get together and share ideas and information.
  
  Thanks and I hope to see you at http://volksfolks.forumwise_dot_com/ soon!
  
  Keith
