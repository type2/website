Subject: rear straight axle for towing  bus with no trans ???
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

Anyone  figure out a  neat way to tow a bus without a tranny ?

something that bolts to the spring plates and the stock cradle mounts....

need to move a bus with no tranny to the paint shop and keep it mobile so 
they can move it around.......
the  back needs to have 2 wheels so it can be pulled  up on a car trailer if 
needed........

Any ideas.......thanks
