I have only one:
67 deluxe 21 window.

Painted all black with a red beltline (hence:
&quot;DARTHVW&quot;) a result of a p.p.o. resto in the 80's.

Original 1500 sp runs well, 100% electrically working
and one key fits all locks. Rust in both rockers and
the upper weatherstrip lip of both doorjambs. 

Full interior and 100% of deluxe bits have been
collected for the resto to Titian red/beige grey very
soon. 

--Jason
