Hi Dan

I have to get back to my paint shop by wednesday about this one- 
 How does a factory correct two tone paint job work in the sills, door edges,
inside, dashboard, etc.?  I am going with a factory two tone combination and
my bus was originally painted in a single color, so I don't have much to go
by.  Please don't slam me for my paint choices, I wouldn't dream of cutting
pieces off of my bus, but I AM going with incorrect colors.  Please help me do
it right.  If it matters, the colors are the 1961 green and grey combination.
64 EZ
 66 Westy&lt;--lil bro's, but I'll take credit..

I think the dash was painted the top colour as of 62.   The entire bus was
painted the top colour, then the inside and top was masked off and the bottom
painted the bottom colour.  Look at the inside of your doors etc  (or a two
tone bus around to see how it was taped.  Take a picture)

The earlier buses (like my 4/61 deluxe) was painted the entire BOTTOM colour
first, then the interior/bottom masked off and the top color painted.   Yes,
the BG on top of the SWR, you can see it where the Beige Grey has worn off in
places on the roof.

I suppose you mean the Turquoise/Bluewhite, which is beautiful, IMOPBO.  I
would do the dash /interior in blue white, I suppose this is for your 64.   Or
maybe you mean the earlier green grey.  Hm, well  decide which gets the paint,
if you are doing the whole durn thing and then painting over half the outside,
or  saving on paint.  Do not tape off the half the bus still in primer if you
are doing it that way, or you will have lines to sand down or they will be
evident through the paint applied later (ask me how I know.)

Hope this helps.  Get rid of all the rust first.   The final result depends on
the prepwork, so take your time prepping- decide what you want though the
actual level of perfection or lack thereof will probably change as the project
goes on.    The package tray is painted off the bus.  Hey, it is much easier
to reinstall all the dash wiring w/o the tray in the way.   Mask off your
wires before painting the dash or they will be all one colour- we used tin
foil on my 65 westy.
