Hit a deer at low speed with my '67, caved in
the front end.  Bummer was it was the day after
the fried engine replacement.  Still missed the
Rogue River kayaking permit day.
Hit a deer with my Vanagon, easiest $900 I ever
made, as that is what the insurance paid me to
get the damage repaired.  A little bashing and
a little rattlecan, hard to tell.
Owls are weird, they don't make a sound in flight,
so there's no whoosh just before impact on the
windshield.  Skunks are so confident, they turn 
tail and spray as a last salute.  Squirrels bounce 
off the underside.  Drunk birds bounce off the
windshield and the ground and then fly away.
