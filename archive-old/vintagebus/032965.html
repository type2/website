Subject: Free stuff - and stuff for trade.
Date: Tue, 8 Sep 1998 14:03:30 -0700 

So,

	we are cleaning up our garage and want to unload some stuff.  Seeing
that dropping it into the local dumpster would prove to be easiest thing to
do, we wanted to see if we can help clutter anothers garage before we
clutter the local landfills.

You pay shipping if I have to ship it, otherwise contact me p-mail and I'll
arrange a pick up or delivery (in the SF bay area)

Free Stuff:

	2  6V battery Cores

	1 12V Battery Core

	a Type 4 Gas heater, working???

The following I want to trade something for or sell CHEEP!.  surprise
me.....

	a type 2 Gas heater (from a 71) working - YES! but needs a new spark
plug.

AND...
I was digging through some of my parts boxes and came upon some stuff  that
I thought others could use. If I find more, I'll post more, but for now,
this will do as they are gathering dust.  Hoping to barter for something I
can use in my year ('67) or other misc. Also looking for cool literature,
orig or photocopy.

	Here's what I have.

	2 Left Wheel Cylinders, FRONT 211 611 069  (55-63)

	3 Right Wheel Cylinders, FRONT 211 611 070  (55-63)

	2 rear cylinders for ???? Me thinks they fit newer busses (71-79)

	Please reply to me off list _at_ roger.nang_at_caere_dot_com

Like I said I would like to barter, but if you wish me to price them out,
just ask.

-Roger
