I am considering buying a '66 Westy, and my next chance to look at it
will be tomorrow night.
Last time I saw it I wanted to take a look at the M-Code plate, but I
couldn't remember two things:
    1. How do I get the passenger seat moved to see the plate?
 -- - - - 
if it is a bench seat, tip the 2/3 part of the seat forward.  If it is a 
walkthrough, pull the bottom part of the seat back up and froward, and you 
will see how it hooks in on top, pull it out and voila!!
..........
    2. Where does the &quot;SO-...&quot; code show up on the M-Code plate?
 - - - -- 
in the m codes- in the middle line(s)
..........
    3. It has a gas heater (eberspacher??) mounted on the driver's side
next to the engine, but the heater has been disconnected by the P.O..
What should I look for to rerstore the function of the heater? What is
the basic operation of this heater? I know nothing about them, is there
information available on the web? 
-  -- - - 
who was it - someone has info on these-  in Arizona, or somewhere in the SW- 
was it Ronnie?
