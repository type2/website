 There was a post about this a few months back.
 The guy had his tent made.
 YeP, FAKE!
 Nice bus!!!!!!

sorry I haven't looked at the picture.  But if you are referring to the tent 
being green/white stripes, yes they DID make them that colour scheme, though 
rare.  Not to say it isn't a repro, just that a tent could be that colour.
