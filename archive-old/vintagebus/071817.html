Is there an advantage to ditching the muffler boxes? Mine are both
there and in good shape?

I prefer the metal tube and dampner pod.  Cause once on a road trip I broke a 
fan belt, which detroyed the right side fresh air tube.  Changed fan belty, 
had no spare fresh air tube, so drove about ten miles with the right side tube 
crumplde close, until I could get a replacement.  This horrible smell went 
into the bus.  The black plastic style heat tube was melting.  ick.
