Subject: intro

hi,  i have rejoined this list after 5 years absence. It is good to be in familiar territory. :-)
have been on the bubble window list lately trying to absorb new information but it is nice to hear
familiar parts and procedures here.

my recent impetus to join was to seek help regarding a selling transaction gone amok.  It was good
to have the background of the list to pull from.  it is a valuable source to be able to go to your
community and seek advice even if it all doesn't make it on the list.  i have appreciated the
replies that came to me.

I am Susan Dolvin, formerly Susan Crandall.  Moved to Drain from Seattle 7 years ago. Currently on
a hay farm called Westfalia Acres. Purchased to house westy buses in the barn.  the supply has
been greatly reduced in the last couple years but my pride is still the 66 dormobile westfalia i
have had for 21 years.  I have sold the vents for the dormo tops for about 20 years. [Good news: I
have recovered my molds and will be processing a new run!!]  So if you need any let me know.
Pricing will be determined at production time. I hear it has gone up but so has everything else
:-(

So i look forward to working on Zapper and digging in the archives for the step by step procedure
since i didn't pay attention years ago !  and thanks for being out there.
