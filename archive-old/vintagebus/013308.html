Subject: just bought a 59 panel...
Message-ID: &lt;19990623163123.48537.qmail_at_hotmail_dot_com&gt;

Hello everyone.  I just bought a 59 double door panel that is in great 
condition with very little rust.  My problem is this...I have a big block 
Chevy motor sitting in my garage that makes about 400 horsepower.  Has 
anyone put one of these into a bus before?  I plan to tub out the rear end 
and drag race at my local 1/8 and 1/4 mile tracks.  I know there will be 
problems but the bus seems to be in great shape so it shouldn't need too 
much reinforcement.  If anyone could help me with any problems I might run 
into and/or tips and tricks I could use.

Thanks,
Terry Mercer
Oliver Springs, TN
