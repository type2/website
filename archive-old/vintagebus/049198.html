Harbor Freight has a tire changer on sale for about $45, regularly ~$80. Don't know how well it works. That and a bubble balancer could give you a part time job. 

If you take those bald tires off real careful, see if the _inside_ has any tread. Turn 'em inside out for another 4-5k miles. 

Don't bite too hard on that BDDC bait, could have a hook it it!
