 Hey Guys &amp; Gals!
 So the the '66 Camper I brought home 2 weeks ago apparently was a panel van 
converted to a camper (which as I have read, seems to be pretty common). In 
re-doing the interior my question is this:  Do those top air vents on the 
very back panels serve any purpose? 
=============
well those three near the top, they give ventilation to the sealed back area 
of a panel van, which comes which a cab divider. and so when you open the 
fresh air vent, they get rid of the 'pop bottle effect' that nice sealed rust 
free VWs allegedly came with. As yours is no longer that style, you can 
safely seal them from the inside to prevent drafts and bugs if you like.  
They have nothing to do with the engine ventilation.
-----------------------------------
 Can I cover them and seal them with something from the inside to prevent 
&quot;intruders&quot; from entering there and raising a family (I live in the country 
and you would be amazed at the places mice and birds find to make their 
homes...there goes my property values!) And lastly, If anyone has done this, 
what did YOU do?  OK, I know that was actually three questions not one, I 
have a tendency to babble...see, there I go again...I'll try to stop...I 
promise...No, really........
