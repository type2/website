Subject: RE: Muffler Noise

This is not a rattle.  Best description is the crinkling sound aluminum cans make when twisted.  Also, it does go away after about 2 or 3 minutes.  I would think that anything in the muffer would be constant, as would any contact between the muffler and body/frame etc..

Enjoy your day!
