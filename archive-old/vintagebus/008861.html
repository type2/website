I own a 66 westy and i really dont know a lot about it and I was wondering
if anyone could tell me what i have, It's a Pearl white walk through westy
with a refrig and club seating with a table between, and shelving on the
door, pop out windows in the front, a tent on the side, and a rack on topp,
its in ok shape, with some rust and 50k miles, i bought it from the original
owners in 1992 but put it away in my barn in okla and havent touched it
since. I plan to have it moved to my home in raleigh NC and begin work on it
next month.  I also have a few other questions concerning body work can you
help. Her they go

1) I am an accomplished welder and some experience in bodywork but no
experience in welding body panels, Should i leave this to a profesional or
do it myself. Should i use Mig or oxy acetylene( I have both) can you also
recommend wire, tips etc.

2) What sources do you use for replacement panels,

3) do you use sandblasting for rust removal

4) How do you remove the old panels, Die grinders, sabre saws, nibler,
plasma etc.

5) Can you give me some sample repair time of lets say the front floors


Thank you

Scott Carter
