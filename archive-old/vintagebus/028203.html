To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

Working on my friends 1962 subhatch Westy......

the side door panels were replaced with cheap grooved paneling

any idea where to get the real look stuff ?

and whats it called?

and are there big enough pieces for the roof, its not bad but  if he redoes 
the side door panels he may get ambitious and  do the  roof.......

Southern California area would be great.........thanks for your help.........
