So how do you determine percentages?  Is there some
fixed number like doctors and paramedics use when
attempting to figure out what percentabe of a person's
skin was burned?  A while back when I first started
down the road of volunteer firefighter, I went into a
building that was fully involved (flames pouring out
the top windows, smoke everywhere) because me and
another firefighter were assigned to search and rescue
while another team of firefighters was clearing the
way with a hose.  Oops, off on a tangent - anyway,
somehow my turnout coat got flipped up and I got 2nd &amp;
3rd degree burns on my back - 9% of my body.  Hurt a
whole lot when they scrubbed off the old skin.  They
call it the rule of nines...

How bout for a bus?

Full nose - 9%
all rockers on left side - 9%
all rockers on right side  9%
both doglegs - 4.5%
both wheel wells - 4.5%
rear corners - 9%
roof - 9%
left front door - 9%
right front door - 9%
left side of bus from b pillar back, not including
wheel wells* - 9%
right side of bus from b pillar back, not including
wheel wells* - 9%
cargo floor - 9%

*May or may not include cargo doors, but it's about
the same amount of metal anyway.

Does that look about right?
