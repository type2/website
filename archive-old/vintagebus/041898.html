&gt; I have been thinking about making one of these for a while now.  My 
&gt; configuration was going to use a 2 cycle single stage snowblower motor and a 
&gt; VW generator.   I was always told that in this application a VW generator 
&gt; would be better than an alternator.  A generator produces power even if the 
&gt; battery is at nearly 0 charge.  Whereas a alternator needs a moderately 
&gt; charged battery.   This way you could use the deep cycle batteries until 
&gt; they were out of charge and then only run the engine to recharge the 
&gt; batteries.  That way you would not have to listen to the thing all the time.

A couple of thoughts:

2-cycle engines aren't all that good for stationary long-term use.  They
aren't all that clean and their fuel usage is high compared to 4-cycle
engines.

Alternators can self-start with the residual voltage of a discharged
battery.  I ran a separate alternator system on my c*evy camper with no
problems self-starting.

considering the cost and complexity of doing this with a VW generator and
regulator, I think that you'd be better off with a good 'ol Delco internal
regulator alternatore, available at wrecking yards everywhere.
