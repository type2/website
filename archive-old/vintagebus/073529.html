Subject: more maintenance-heat improvement

This may sound familiar, but the heat tube in my 61 has a habit of shaking loose.  That is, the connection between the heater box and the tube/pod that is on the body.  Then my heat volume gets pretty wimpy up front.   So every so often I climb under there , move the tube into place and re-duct tape it.   seeing as the weather is getting chilly, it's time to fix it right,(as suggested by Arnott et al).

A complication is that the bus &amp; tube from bus and dampener pod are 60mm diameter.  However, the heater boxes are 80mm.  Rather than swap heater boxes, I've been duct taping.   for some reason the side that leads the heat to the rear stays put, just the side that gives heat to the front wiggles loose.

Amazing, I found an NOS adaptor, p/n 211 255 something or other, in my stash of parts.   I crawled under the bus with a razor blade and some wrenches, pulled the duct tape off, the pod/tube (which I'd done a couple? years ago when I rebuildt the fuel petcock, so it wasn't rusted on, fitted the adaptor to the heater box, reinstalled the stock pod and tube (with it's insulation cover), and it was very groovy.   Applied some clamps, snugged it down, and low and behold the heat was of a greater volume than the previous drive.   

YAY!

how's that for an example of a part you really don't care is NOS or not?  Fit nice though.
