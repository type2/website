One of my friends here in town has a 58 bus... i believe it was commercial because
of the black knobs and steering wheel and only has the headliner in the cab
area...well...that pressboard stuff.  It must have been a kombi...as it has the
side windows.  Anyways...the bus was painted green, then red...but the engine bay
still remains that beautiful dove blue color.

the 62's looks good though...even if it isn't original.  I don't see any reason
why anyone would have touched it though....
there was a ton of road grime and gook up in there today.... yuck! so if it was
done...it was done a loooooong time ago.

&gt; My ex-58 singlecab engine compartment was dove blue.
&gt; I DOUBT it was resprayed because they didnt touch the floor, the dash,
&gt; interior, etc.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; &gt; Commercial vehicles are primer in the engine bay, I believe, up to a certain
&gt; &gt; year.  My ex-'63 SC was white, my ex-'60 SC was factory-looking primer.
&gt;
&gt; kombis too.
&gt; Right on into the Bays
