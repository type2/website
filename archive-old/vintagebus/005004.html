&gt; Also, I want to install some sort of tie-down mounts inside, so I can put
&gt; my cycle truck (or whatever) in there and strap it down.  What would be
&gt; cool would be to use the same sort of strap mounts as single cabs have.
&gt; Any other ideas?


I found small stainless steel loops (U-shaped, 2 screws) at a local marine
supply. I put them on the inside of Rosies's side gates for tie-downs and to
secure the bungee spider web.. They're small and unobtrusive, but work very
well. I also have a bunch of chrome plated plastic ones if anybody's
interested.
