Howdy fellow VW Loons,
             I have a set of wheels I have had in my posesion for about 10 years
I traded a Winchester 30-30 for them.  I am need of a little help in determining
what they are.  I saw some that looked like them on a site which said they were
Rocket Something Wheels they are wide five and I need to know if they would be
strong enough for my 63 Single Cab since they are made of magnesium.   If
someone in the know around Sacramento wouldn't mind  taking a look and telling
me what they are for sure I appreciate it.

Peace,
Nathan
