Subject: clutch problem
Date: Fri, 3 Mar 2000 03:16:11 +0100 

Hello

I have had a problem with my clutch, in my '64 micro.
At first it would change gear proberly, and when I start the bus with the
clutch push to the buttom, the bus is giving a little spring forward. This
problem, we fix by ajust the clutch.
BUT
Now the problem is when I give the bus gas ex. by 60 Km/h in 4. gear, the
only thing that's happens is that the engine get more rpm but no speed. My
question is now can I ajust this or should I change the cluth ?
Is't a sign to ajust now and change in about 500 Km or so (not drive on a
vacation without changing) ?

If I should stop driving the bus and change at once please mail me at
splitbus_at_mail.dk &lt;mailto:splitbus_at_mail.dk&gt;  (I'm writing from my work)

Ciao
