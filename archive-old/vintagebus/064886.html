&gt;
&gt; So, by the time you add it all up, those VW engineers really knew what they
&gt; were doing. The short aluminum height with the large expansion compensates
&gt; for the short expansion of the cast iron cylinders and so over the distance
&gt; from the case to the end of the studs, the expansion is about equal between
&gt; the two structures.
&gt;
&gt; George, can you add anything to that? I don't have all the heights otherwise
&gt; I would run the numbers to prove all of it.

Not much. The stud screws into the case at the same plane that the
cylinders butt up against the case, so the case shouldn't affect things
much.  My references don't show that much difference in the expansion
coefficients for cast iron and steel, but aluminum is much greater.

I need some dimensions to figure out the actual expansion, but with the
info I have I know that the studs will be tensioned by higher
temperatures.
