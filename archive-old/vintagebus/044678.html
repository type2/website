In a message dated 98-07-21 19:57:59 EDT, you write:

&lt;&lt; Anyway he tells me the rebuilt
 trans is from a '67 Bug and he had to put in a 12 volt starter because the
old
 6 volt wouldnt fit in the trans properly.  OK my question: &gt;&gt;
The bus and type 1s used the same tranny center section in the 50s-60s.  

&lt;&lt;I would suppose it still had the 6 volt flywheel.  Problem, right?  He says
no, he's done it many times without any trouble.  Then he says it looked like
the flywheel was a 12 volt anyway.  Wait a minute,  LOOKED like a 12 volt
flywheel? Doesn't this decide the clutch size too?  For the starter concern,
he said that if it made me feel better, there was a bushing that allowed one
to use a 6 volt starter with a later transmission.  OK great he'll put it in
for me-but what about the flywheel-clutch thing?  Maybe PO was running a 6
volt starter with a 12 volt flywheel?  No grinding or problems with starting
prior to this though. Then I hear some buses used a 6 volt flywheel that was
the same size as the 12 volt  HELP!&gt;&gt;
You can put either 6 or 12 volt starters in VW with just a change of the
starter bushing.  As for the flywheel you have to put the flywheel with the
right teeth for the starter you are going to use.  If you go to the bigger dia
12 volt flywheel and put it into a pre-1967 tranny you will have to grind a
little off the inside of the tranny bell housing.  As to the clutch pressure
plate, disc and the flywheel having a clutch area of 180 or 200mm these both
where used for both 12 volt and 6 volt.  We prefer using the 200mm 6 volt
flywheel for both 6 and 12 volt systems with a 9 spring pressure plate not the
weaker 6 spring or diaphram style.  On our 12 volt VWs we just change the
solinoid to 12volt on the 6 volt starter.    Eric &amp; Barb
PS From what you say about your mechanic, it sounds like you need to find a
new one or better yet get your hands dirty and do the job right.  EEE&amp;B
