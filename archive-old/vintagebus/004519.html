Hello Everyone,

I researched about 50 different transportation companies when I was having
my '55 Single shipped from Oregon to Florida.  I finally decided on
http://www.haascarriage_dot_com/ , Eric at Haus is a really nice guy and and
came through 100% with substaintial savings on my part.
I am not affiliated with Haus Carriage in any way, but they have come
through for me and I suggested them to a guy needing an early Ghia shipped
from west to east coast...he wrote me a while back and said Haus did an
excellent job for him as well.

-Tom
