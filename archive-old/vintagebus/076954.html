Subject: Re: [VB] Clutch pedal removal

You can lie under the bus and pull the lever down with your hand  ( pedal pan 
off)  this may help decide if that's the issue... disconnecting clutch cable 
could help here.   When the pivot area gets stucky it can be a PITA, I don't 
remember exactly how I did it, plus get it mixed up with the brake pivot, put I 
do think there was some creative use of a hammer.   Spray liquid wrench like 
holy water ala Muir.  My 61 has a grease fitting on the clutch pivot (I think 
or was it the brake )  but unfortunately the later buses don't   When you have 
it apart you might install one, though I haven't bothered.    liberally 
grease everything when installing.  your bus likes grease.  grease the suspension 
and wipe the excess around under the bus as anti rust preventative.

Talking about greasing suspensions, my 61 is squeaking over bumps as of two 
days ago, so I gotta grease it again.   though it has been less than 3K miles.  
 the absolute mess of the bridge and area around it downtown has many 
annoying severe bumps.   Was supposed to be done I think Nov 2003.  (damaged in 6.9 
Earthquake)  Contruction's been going on for what 2 years or something.  Pisses 
me off.   The gummit can spend billions on Iraq, when with proper funding 
this bridge would have been done ages ago.   I guess this is considered 'driving 
on bad roads' and the bus oughta be greased every 700 miles or whatever.     I 
better grease it or it'll wear the link pins out.

Hey all, 

   I got a '67 that has a sticky clutch pedal.  I'm pretty sure that what I 
need to do is clean up and grease the pivot and pivot bushing under the pedal.

   Does anyone have a trick to push out the pivot?  I think I might need to 
make a special tool to get the leverage I need to push the pivot out.  There's 
no room for a drift and hammer.

   Any help would be appreciated.

THANKS
