If you guys go to http://www.tomgreen_dot_com/photos/vote_5.html I've put a
picture of me sleeping at BNNTA last year.  This is for a travel photo
contest so if you wanna help me win a stupid prize, go there and click on
VOTE next to my photo to make me the winner!  You'll see Rob's SC and
Terry's 65 Westy in the background.  If you really look, you can see my 67.

If you go to the URL and see nothing, my picture is called Erin Lassley and
since they are all alphabetized, you can go forward or back until you find
me sleeping on the ground.

Brag me up guys and gals!!!
