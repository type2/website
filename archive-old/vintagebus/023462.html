Steven Howell and I examined my fuel door on my 1967 pretty closely.. it has
the lip for finger pull, but also has all the (properly cut and aligned)
parts of a church key lock.

But there is nothing but a hole where the lock would go.  The arm is there
that matches a church key design... our best guess is that maybe at one time
there was a REAL Key lock (matching doors and engine hatch)?

Was a fuel door lock an option in 1967?

Definitely a '67.  Giveaway is on rside.jpg. Finger pull instead of 
church-key latch on gas filler.
