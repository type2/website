I did not fare well on meeting a lot of people, although I was there for
more than 3 hours.  Just met those I already knew.... except for Clara.  I
introduced myself to her.

I will admit that I had seen Clara at other shows but didn't realize who she
was... whatever that means.

And I can't let this go:  I purchased a visor from Clara ... and oh, it
didn't have enough GREASE ON IT!  She felt so guilty she knocked another 1/3
off the price and explained the procedure on how to grease it &lt;grin&gt;.

P.S.  Took my Crew to the show ... thanks to all for helping me identify and
locate generator woodruff keys.
