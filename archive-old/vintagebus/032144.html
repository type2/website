OK I talked to a friend awile back from florida that was heading west for the
classic and asked if he could set up camp at my house one night..I told him
sure and gave him directions but heard nothing else...His name is Kaz aka
SlowVWBus or WhoDaspaz on aol..does anyone know if the caravan is heading 
west?

for the caravan in Stockton..anyone whos knows about his venture...will I come
home and have a few more vw's at the house??
