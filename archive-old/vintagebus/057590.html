Subject: Re: [VB] Friday question


  To me it looks more like an early vanagon. I did see
one episode where they had to have the rear end
repaired. They showed the engine in the back but it
had 2 doors that opened out on the back instead of a
hatch. I assumed that they were attempting to mimic a
VW but, I could be wrong. I am quite often. I like to
think of it as a VW. I gives me an excuse to watch the
cartoon. :0)

&gt; Since the actual mystery machine is an american van,

&gt; doubt they would have used a VW in the movie.

&gt; &gt; Any of you SoCal, Hollywood insider type bus folks
&gt; &gt; have the scoop as to if the &quot;Mystery Machine&quot; in
&gt; the
&gt; &gt; new Scooby Doo movie is a VW or not?  You can only
&gt; &gt; see a partial shot of the cargo door in the
&gt; &gt; commercial.  Looks like it might be.  I'll have to
&gt; &gt; take my boys to go see iteither way but if there
&gt; is
&gt; &gt; a VW in it at least I would have something to look
&gt; &gt; forward too.
