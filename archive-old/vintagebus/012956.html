I'm supposed to be working on the shroud but
it bores me . . . :-)

Spring time and talk turns to springs . . is that
how it works .? :-)

The crew speaks of a new hi-po engine  . .  that's
all . . :-)

These valve springs and hi-lift cams and ratio rockers
'n swivel foots 'n  . . . . .

I wrote a post on springs one time . . probably a 
shallow piece meant to entertain the unwashed masses . .
much like this one . . :-)

I just recently went thru this whole exercise with
my friend Dick . . I'm pleased to say he hit most  of
the errors . . :-) of course I helped . . how you think
he got in that mess ?  :-)

Dick had the hydraulic eqivalent to the 120 Engle . .
Dual springs from CBP  . . then he got stupid . .

He goes for a set of ratio rockers to stack on top
this . . then he found he could get the 1.4 : 1's
for the same price as the 1.25's . . more's better
right?  

This thing ate springs . . spring retainers . .
lash caps . . (can you spell &quot;float&quot;) 3 sets of 
push-rods and 2 cams and numerous lifters . .

You get in this beast and blip on the throttle, you're
at 9 grand now . . 

Oh, he blew up two coolng fans too . . grenaded

He ended up keeping the hi-ratio rockers, he's all
the way back down to a stock grind cam and a single
set of hi-po springs from Bugpack . .

So Dicks only problem now,(we were out climbing
mountains and trees last week-end . .) is that he
just can't get the damn thing warm . .

Oil stays down around 120 no matter what . .

Probably the biggest single piece of data I have here
is run the weakest springs you can and not float'em.

Why strong springs at all ? . . 

Inside the case and on the center line, resides the
Cam . . the magic bump-stick . .

The cam is driven by the crankshaft himself and has
a 2:1 reduction ? . . 

On each side of the cam, cunningly tucked into the 
case, are the &quot;Followers&quot; or &quot;Lifters&quot;  . .
Each in it's own bored piston-like sleeve . .

The lifter has a big base on it like a mushroom . .
Not all do tho . .
Still . . the big base catches the cam face and rolls
across as it is lifted by the cam . .
The same cam lifts #1 and then rotates and lifts #3.

In the top end of the lifter(outer side to us) sits
the pushrod . . it's about 10.5&quot; (4.1 cm) long and
aboot 6mm in dia . . (1/4&quot;) . .

The pushrod gets a violent push from the lifter and 
it in turn pushes on the rocker arm that then pushes
inward on the valve stem . .

The valve stem has a long bronze guide/bushing to slide
thru . . 

I'm going to talk about &quot;float&quot; if I can get there. :-)

Climbing ladders maybe . . when you go up a ladder
one-handed . . most of us do this or you may have seen.
You have a bucket in one hand and you have the other
on the rungs there . . 
this is considered good form . :-)

Now to get up the ladder you have to let go with your hand,
step up, and grab the next rung up before you fall . .

This by the way, is not one of those &quot;inherent&quot; things.
This is a real &quot;mind over fear&quot; thing . . learned

So you let go of the ladder, step up, gravity is right
on your butt, it's going to get you but you grab the
ladder before it can . . :-)

Time is the factor we want out of this and Newtons
&quot;first Law&quot; . . &quot; a body in motion remains in motion,
a body at rest remains at rest . . yada yada . .

We need a new word too . . &quot;Hysteresis&quot; . . big mojo
on that one  . . :-)
I'll define that as &quot;high-speed friction&quot;.

So we have all this stuff with the new words wrapped
around, going up and down at a terrible speed . .

That single hi-po spring weighs in at about 150psi/in
spring rate . .

Your doubles and triples go on up to 5-600 psi/in . .

The big boys say springs must be matched for rates
as opposed to getting the most in there . .

Now we add up the dammage: lifters plus friction plus
pushrod plus rocker arm plus more friction plus 
friction of swivel-foot on valve stem now picking up 
the spring plus coil wrap plus friction of valve guide
plus compression left in the chamber . .

All of those items including the spring have mass. .
All have friction in long bores . . at higher speeds
even the oil mass is bad . .

The oil and everything else works against you at 
hi speed. this is the &quot;hysteresis&quot; . . oil on oil
is now a friction thing . .
Rubber seals will just tear, they can't move aside fast 
enough.

So this valve stem reaches a point in speed where it
just can't move . . the spring can't move it fast
enough to follow the cam . .

That's &quot;float&quot; . . . this engine is doing 9 grand rpm, the pushrod
et al are going a full up and down stroke 4500 times a minute,
that's what 75 times a second . .?

So why do I say &quot;the lightest spring possible&quot;?
Horsepower and friction . .

Cams and lifters are case hardened . . a surface 
hardening about .03-.06&quot; thick (3/4 to 1-1/2mm&quot;.

Hardening jobs are not all created equal . .

If you are into the hi-speed stuff, you better
find a shop that can do a hardness test for you . .

Down at the core of eiher item, you want a nice soft 
material . . it absorbs shock . .

The heavier the spring rate the greater the friction
thru-out . . the more friction the more wear, which
causes even more friction  . . friction is always a hp thief.

There is no point to your trying to achieve the 
impossible . . it's been tried . .

Decide what your max rpm is to be and put in springs
that don't float up to that rpm range . .

Double and triple springs: don't know all that much
about it . . supposed to overlap each others natural
frequency or some kind of voodoo . . :-)

I tell you this much  . . put them in exactly like
the instructions say to . . you don't have any 
instructions . . give them back to the idiot you 
got them from.

For one spring you have all this spot-facing or shimming
to get the springs all the same rate . .
You then have to check for bind etc . .

You have dual springs you now have dual headaches.

You cannot cheat at this stuff . . it just eats your
engine . .

You see those titanium retainers . . ? these are for
you . .:-)

Serious . . you want the lightest materials and 
components you can find to overcome the mass thing.

What do you mean you got 9mm valve stems . . ? 
get rid of 'em .  those are for freakin' trucks :-)

CB Performance has a light-weight lifter too . .

Now you start weighing the components for 
each hole . . . . . . they must all be within grams
of each other . .

Polishing all sliding or rotating parts, friction is a constant,
you want to double the rpm with no new friction, double the finish
on the part . . you will still get more friction but you're close.

You deliberately cut grooves in the lifter bores and valve guides
to reduce friction . . at the same time you tighten the bore/rod
clearance to maintain alignment . .

 
The man told you a long time ago, &quot;speed costs, how
much you got, kid?&quot; . .  :-)
