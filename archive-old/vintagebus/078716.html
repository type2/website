Subject: Fw: [VB] fan width

Maybe its time to run through this airflow model again. It occurred to me
that this choked flow will suck air from wherever it will leak in from. This
includes the areas that have warmer sources as well as cooler sources.

&gt; &gt; The most important thing to do is to minimize all the gaps  where air
can
&gt; &gt; leak through the tin, particularly those that allow hot air  from under
&gt; &gt; the engine to return to the engine bay.  All the airflow in  the world
won't
&gt; &gt; help if the air entering the fan is already hot!  I've  lost count of
the
&gt; &gt; times I've stopped to help a VW person overheated on a  summer day and
&gt; &gt; found gaping holes around the missing hot air or heater  tubes.
&gt; &gt; All the tin ware is in good condition with the correct
&gt; &gt; rubber grommets around the heater tubes.
