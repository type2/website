Jon writ:
&gt;Does anyone know where I can get a pair of old 4,5&quot; fuchs wheels? &lt;

Try:  http://www.wheelenhancement_dot_com  (sure to have them and will refinish
them for you)

Or if you want straight up used ones try: http://www.partsheaven_dot_com/


But how did you get Fuchs on your bus?  I know this question has come up
many times before, but no one gave the dirt on how to do it &quot;right&quot;.  A tech
article for the library would be very much appreciated.


Thanks,
