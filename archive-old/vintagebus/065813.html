&lt;&lt; need help please, does any know how you can tell if your voltage regulator
 goes bad .i droped it pretty hard! my p.u. won`t start now. maybe i might 
have
 it wired wrong. i took it off to primer engine compartment.thanks greg

hm, THink you should be able to start the engine and run it even if the 
voltage regulator isn't hooked up, so perhaps it is something else.   Do 
double check all your wires.  Does the engine turn over but not catch?  W/ a 
bad regulator teh engine should run but the gen light come on, I think 
brighter when you rev the engine
