Subject: RE: [VB] Front brake drum seal problem, etc.

oh yeah, a 68-- seal has a different inside diameter, so you'd need the
&quot;adapter&quot; sized seal.


&gt; [Original Message]
&gt; yes, i've seen this before. i believe you have a 68-70 front drum, which
&gt; will work on a split. you need to get the &quot;adapter&quot; seal that has the same
&gt; inside diameter as the early, but the outside diameter as the late drum. i
&gt; don't have a part number, but i know foreign aide in albuquerque
&gt; (1-800-658-5712) stocks them (if you describe the early/late drum scenario
&gt; they should be able to find it on the shelf no problem--it should be with
&gt; the 64-67 seals), and maybe ronnie does too, but i don't know for sure.
&gt; when you get the &quot;adapter&quot; seal, it should bolt on no problem.

&gt; &gt; Greetings, All...
&gt; &gt;     I received my new front brake drums(yea!) for my 65 and
&gt; &gt; proceeded to clean them up(yea!) and install new bearings(yea!).
&gt; &gt; Got the bearing races installed(yea!) and then went to test fit the
&gt; &gt; seal. The seal just dropped in...(boo!). 
&gt; &gt;    OK...the drums are Frum units, #1346E, =VW#211.405.615E.
&gt; &gt; The seals are Sabo 01711-BRG, and are supposed to be = VW#
&gt; &gt; 211.405.641B.(I believe they are correct for that year VW bus
&gt; &gt; because the new seal will fit my old drums fine).
&gt; &gt;    The the new drum seal bore is 1 or 2mm. larger than the old VW
&gt; &gt; original drums.
&gt; &gt;    Has anyone run into this problem and, if so, how did you correct it?
&gt;
