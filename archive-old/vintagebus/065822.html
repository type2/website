&gt; hm, THink you should be able to start the engine and run it even if the

Hi Volks,
The engine should start, but running it for more than a few seconds with the 
regulator disconnected from the generator in 1964 and later buses or earlier 
ones with 12 volt generator adapted will burn out the generator.
