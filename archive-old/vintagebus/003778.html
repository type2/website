Wednesday morning there was a wreck in front of my house.  I had been
standing outside looking my bus over when I heard the BOOM and skidding of
tires so I ended up calling 911 when it was confirmed there was an injury.
The caption in the paper says they are trying to extracate a man when it
fact it was a woman.  But what's the big deal here?  Well the newspaper got
a picture of the wreck and in the background you see a full shot of my house
complete with busted garage door and if you look over on the right hand side
of the picture, you can see the rear end of my 67 bus. :-)  I almost made
it... :-)
