Subject: REV LIMITER?

I have a motor that I picked up a few years ago out of a 65 bus that has a
rev limiter on it under the carburater,(at least that is what I think it
is). It's got a flat plate on the front of it, I was wondering if anyone
knew what years and models these went on and can they be rebuilt if they go
bad. Also how do they work? Thanks.
