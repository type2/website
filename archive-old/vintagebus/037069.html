Subject: more truck gummipuffers
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

that is gate buffers to you!!!

noticed on a truck this evening downtown oly-  OG paint63 sc, has lower body 
buffers at rear by vents.  also has a varied assortment of kinds of 
gummipuffers.  didn't ask the owner (who wasn't in the truck) if he had 
attached them or not, so I dont know what were original.   think the lower 
ones were 25mm, but this wierd guy started talking to me and my friend, so we 
left.
