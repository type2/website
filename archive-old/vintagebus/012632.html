Message-Id: &lt;199904111143450_at_lustinky.thedrivein.zzn_dot_com&gt;

first off i would like to thank everyone for their speedy reply to my letter, and id like to let you guys (and gals) know that i will probably now, end up doing the (brake) work myself. thank you.
it doesnt seem like a very impossible job, and i have some helpful family members (no vw enthusiests though).
for your information, if you could extend a helping hand, i live in southern california, thousand oaks to be exact (south of ventura, north of LA). i need to restore this bus, to a reliable condition (at least) for minimal cost, before i go off to college (in santa cruz). i want to be able to take the bus with me to UCSC, and not break down on the road between school and home. so thats why i was just considering a mechanic, to restore some easy things. but the estimate i got was just outlandish, so i decieded to get an estimate from some experienced, honest people, which i assume many of you are. so anyways, thanxxx for your help, and ill get back to you guys as soon as something happens, thanks again.
and if you can extend any more help, please feel free to keep emailing me.

mikie!
