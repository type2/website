Subject: 66 porsche  buckets vs. stock front becnch

Morning all,

I debating on what I should do for seating on my 66 hardtop deluxe non 
walktru.  My drivers side partition on my front bench has a descent frame 
but will need a recover and posibbly pads, the 2/3 passengerside has kinks 
in the elbos so don't know if I want to even play w/ these, in definite need 
of pads and recover.

I saw a bus in a old hot vws issue like mine with 2 914 buckets with neat 
carpeting in the middle....this idea seems nice for making a compartment for 
tapes drinks whatever in the middle.  Really have no use for a bench except 
to stay original...my dog is too big to fit between me and my girlfriend and 
my girlfriend choosed not to sit directly beside me as this is popular in 
trucks in the south!

Anyway could possibly get black 66 porsche 912 buckets in real good 
condition...they look the same as walktru seats for a 66 bus.  Are they?  do 
you all think I could use my existing rails and hook mechanism or the 
proshce rails for an easy intal?

Any advice or ideas are greatly appreciated.  Sorry so long!

Eric
