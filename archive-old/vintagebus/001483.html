Subject: church key hole cover thingy springs

Hi All,

I have gone through the trouble to re chrome the covers to the gas door and
engine lid church key holes.  In the process, I made new stainless steel
rivets and now it's time to coil a few springs out of music wire.  However,
because both of my covers had springs that were totally disintegrated, could
someone look at theirs and tell me where the ends of the springs go?

I could just wing it but hey, I could get it wrong and then someone would
recognize the fact that the springs were *wrong* and criticize the entire
truck...arrghhh, the thought is terrifying ;-) ... hell, they'll criticize
me anyway since I have s.s. rivets in the hole covers but I digress....

Anyone else need some replacement springs while I'm winding???
