----- Original Message ----- 
&gt; I would never drive my '71 for four solid minutes with the pedal floored
under
&gt; any circumstances.  Not enough cooling to compensate.  If I did that and
my
&gt; engine melted down, I'd call it &quot;driver error.&quot;  If I need the pedal
floored
&gt; to maintain speed and the hill will last longer than about 20-30 seconds,
I
&gt; downshift into 3rd and slow to 40.

VW designed thier vehicles to be driven floored without ill effects. Top
speed was thier maximum cruising speed as well.

If you can't floor your motor for extended periods without running hot,
something in the combo is not right (or not as good as it was from the
factory).
