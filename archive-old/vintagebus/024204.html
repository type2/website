Subject: Front suspension inspected

Thats to everyone that sent me the courage to try fixing the stuck front
end myself. I have been at it all day and have identified all amy
problem parts.
Both top torsion arms are attached are frozen at the linkpin. These pins
have needle bearings and a sleeve that fit into the kingpin. The
bearings/sleeves/pin are frozen and rusted to death from lack of grease
and bent from the pressure of bouncing. The kingpins and the hole that
holds the sleeve are fine.
Is there a source for these parts that anyone could suggest. I need the
2 top linkpins for a 1965 bus with bearing and sleeves. Until I get them
I will be relegated to driving a P*****c. RMMW doesn't list the parts. I
don't have any other catalogs to search. Anybody out there have a couple
to spare? Fair price for correct fit.
Again thanks for the suggestions
Tery Wolfe
