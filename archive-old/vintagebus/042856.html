Hey Daniel,
I'm pretty sure that Hasagawa doesn't make a deluxe model kit, at least
not anymore.  And I'm pretty sure that the '67 panel is a pretty new
release.  I've seen the plain dove blue panel and the &quot;Hawaiian&quot; themed
one also.  Just thought I'd let you know since my folks own a hobby shop.

&gt; the kit for the '67 panel.
&gt; Could you please re mail me the #'s so that they can get me the deluxe,
&gt; so that I can have both.  2 more for the collection.
