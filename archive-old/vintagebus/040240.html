OK list my wife wants A/C when we go camping.  A year or two ago I saw a few 
photos in a hotvw mag. which were taken at some kind of event.  The pre 67 
westy had a AC mounted in the right front window, the person removed the 
slider glass and did some creative plywood cutting to fill around the AC.  I 
think there was a strap or something that hung from the gutter rail.  Does 
anybody know of this install???

I'm sure this will bring up some concerns which I thought of few, the 
condensation inside the bus due two the heat outside.  What about driving 
down the road could it be removable and install the glass back?

Anyway the info would be nice after this last weekend of 100' in the shade, 
I like the idea.

Steve
66 Westy
