   Alrighty, getting ready to try an electrical overhaul on my '62
Kombi...tired old 6V bus...and I'm looking for a bit o' advice about the whole
thing.  What happened when you did this?  What did you wish you had but didn't
at the time?  I'm planning on sticking a voltage drop under the dash to handle
things like wiper motor and anything I can't afford to replace all at once.
Did
you experience any problems afterwards because of missed details?  I am
planning
on getting one of those conversion kits...or does someone have a better idea?

do you mean you are thinking of converting because the electrics seem tired?
Before doing that I would clean the connections- your bus is 36 years old and
it is very likely that there is a bunch of resistance from corrosion at the
terminals.    I use fine sandpaper-  though I hear tell of a wonderstuff you
can dip it in and it become instantly clean.   unhook every connection from
the fuse block, one at a time to be less confusing, clean it and hook it back
up.   Take the wires off the taillights/headlight/front turn signals and clean
them too.   everything you want to have more juice to, basically.    If you
have a voltage drop, you can test voltage before and after.   Or use a test
light and see how bright it is at the hot wire to whatever circuit you pick,
and then how bright direct to battery?   See a difference?  It's because of
resistance in the system.   Get rid of the corrosion.   Make sure your
taillights have good grounds.  Clean your battery connections and where the
ground strap grounds and the connections at the starter.  

I need to do this to the rest of the stuff on my 6V 59.
