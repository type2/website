Subject: Rear shock mounts
Message-ID: &lt;37FD1BFC.D6D58AD0_at_earthlink_dot_net&gt;

On the new very rusty Westy parts bus I just acquired, the rear upper
shock mounts are completely GONE!  It looks like they've been ripped
off.  I assume that rust and vibration broke them off.  The bus had no
rear shocks (obviously) when I got it.

I'm going to put it back on the road (thanks to CA which has no
inspection...just the money sir) and drive it till I need the interior
for my '65, and would like to have some shocks back there.  Is anyone
making repops?  Or do I have to find some donors?  Anyone have any???

Thanks!!

Steve
