The following has been my experience with Bus Depot.  Last winter I ordered 
complete door rubber sets as well as some additional rubber window seals 
from Bus Depot.  I asked if they had it all in stock and were assured they 
did. I was sent part of the door sets immediately. However they sent two 
left sides for the vent window seals. They did not send the door to frame 
seals. They sent turn signal seals for bullet lens even though I had 
specified they were for a 67. They sent the back window glass seal for a 
small glass.  They also managed to lose a money order for 59 dollars.  I 
ordered the incorrect seals from Ronnie at Old Volks and of course got the 
correct stuff.  I have since ordered several hundred dollars worth of stuff 
from him and it has always been right.
    Oh the kicker was when two months ago, a full five months after it had 
been ordered I received the door to frame seals by priority mail.  This is 
just my experience and my not be indicative of anyone else's experience.
