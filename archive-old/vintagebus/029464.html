With the purchase of my new syncro, I now must depart with my daily driver, and
another vanagon I just purchased (or sleep in them!).

First the daily driver.  I have owned this one for about 5 months and bought it
from the original owner.  He came into the dealer and traded it in for a new
Mountaineer, ?   It doesn't leak a drop and runs great.  I put in a new Dealer
clutch, German rotors, German drums, German wheel cylinders, Dealer rear shoes,
ATE front pads, and an ATE clutch slave cylinder.  It was originally 2-tone blue,
but has since been repainted the upper, lighter blue color throughout.  It has
135K miles, but had a factory engine installed 2 years ago.  I even installed a
new windshield and Dealer seal.  This vanagon is ready to go anywhere and is very
complete.  $2500.  I have pics and can email on request.

The other vanagon is a 9 passenger.  1/3 - 2/3 front seat and full middle and
rear seats.  I have not seen one of these in quite a while.  A customer drove it
in claiming it was gutless.  After telling him it needed a head, he settled on
another car and traded it in.  It does run, but it needs some work.  It has a
dent on the left side, just in front of the rear wheel well and a little window
rust, but is not bad.  It is light blue with a cream white upper.  It is $800
now, but the more work I do to it, the more it will be.  Please grab it now and
spare me the work!  Again, pics are available to email.

I also have some parts from a strip I did on a 80/81 vanagon.
Dash
Instrument cluster
Westy luggage rack
Heater control pipes behind the dash
Sliding door
Rear hatch
Turn signal assemblies
Front grille
2 Rear closets

These items are on a 'make offer' price.  The parts I have had for almost 5 years
now and I am ready to deal.  Send me an offer.  I can ship any of these items
from work.
