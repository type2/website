Subject: Stolen door handle!

Hi Volks,
Went out today to a 1958 panel bus we have been storing several  years for an 
old HS friend (who has been in the army and done tours in  Afganstan and 
Iraq) of Eric's, and the cargo door handle, latch and even  the locking rods had 
been stolen.  #$%&amp;*  Pretty sure we have  the parts to replace most everything, 
but the 1955-58 exterior  handle.  So we were wondering if someone might have 
a spare handle we could  buy or trade for?  Does not need to be perfect, the 
one that was on this  bus was well worn and pitted, and this is going to be a 
summer driver not a  show car.
Thanks,
Eric&amp;Barb
