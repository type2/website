Don't worry, he's just jealous.  he wants to be able to send his bus to a 
good shop for a nice resto.  The first thing that popped into my mind  when I 
read your first post was wondering how much you want to be involved in the 
resto, and learn this stuff, rummage at VW shows for that missing latch or 
whatever,  talk with people who know old buses and older westies about what 
came with yours, etc etc, or if you want the bus you have magically turned 
into the perfect running shiny nice bus it once was.  

other thing is, you should figure out, to some extent at least, what defines 
a resto,  what kind of body work does it need?  
how much do you expect to pay for parts (such as all those old seals you will 
need to replace)?  Are you going to add some extras?   Does this include 
going through the brakes/engine/tranny/steering&amp;supsension/interior/rust 
repair/body/paint?  sounds like it for that money.  Have some sort of plan 
and schedule, with payments as each part is done, to keep that carrot 
motivation there.

&lt;&lt; Hi All,
 I am new to this list and if I have offended anyone, my sincere apologies.  
 Our bus has been in storage for 6 years now.  I just think it's time to get 
 it back on the road.  We've saved money to fix it up, neither one of us know 
 how to do the project, so we just want to have a good job by someone who 
does 
 know how to do it.

  &gt; Hello all, I was wondering where I could get a job so I could afford to
  &gt; spend 15-75k on restoring my bus. Let me know where to send my resume. I
  &gt; would be willing to relocate to mars for that kind of spending money.
  &gt; Unless some kind soul out there would like to donate the money to me. In
  &gt; that case I won't send out my crayon written resume.  Shawn &gt;&gt;
