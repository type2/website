are there any listees who live near Butch of Bears VW, he is building my
engine, and before I send him any money-he expects a certified check, I would
appreciate knowing that this engine actually exists....i don't have his
address right here, but he is right outside san diego... if you are in the
area and could help me with this I would appreciate it. i have his address in
my studio(i'm currently at work).

thanks,
kevin
