Whew!  What a day!  I learned by being stupid why they call those things on
a flywheel &quot;teeth&quot;....I was turning it by hand, and I thought to myself
&quot;maybe I should not do this like this&quot; with my finger getting awfully close
to the bottom stud and.....ow!

But, in keeping with the subject, I replaced the clutch and all parts
thereof, installed new axle boots, cleaned up many greasy old things, and
went for a ride...yippee!  The bus now shifts much better, the tranny seems
to be howling even less than before (I can hear the engine now), and my
finger hurts....

BTW, the new cross-shaft for the throw-out bearing seems to be very solid,
and it put the bearing in a satisfactorily centered position.....
