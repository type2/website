List:

I have a factory set of VW NOS 25hp pistons and cylinders up for trade. 
These are 75.5mm, dished low compression pistons.  Still in cosmoline, in
the original VW box.  I need an NOS set of German 36hp P&amp;C's;
Kolbenschmidt, Mahle, etc.

At this point I only want to trade, cash doesn't do me much good right
now, I need P&amp;C's so I can get to the motor builder.  Unless of course
you need these and know someone who will sell me theirs.  Pmail me for
pics; if during the day I can be reached at:

rdavis_at_sbch_dot_org

TIA.

Robert
