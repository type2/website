Subject: Re: Brake wheel cylinder paste...

Thanks Everyone,

Lots of people replied to my query, most with the answer about just 
using new brake fluid (which is what I'll do to get them together 
today).  I still haven't found any for sale locally.  But others showed 
me that ATE still makes &quot;ATE brake cylinder assembly paste&quot; which comes 
in a small tube.  I'll order some for the future from a supplier in 
England (www.alfastop.co_dot_uk/) that I found by Googling &quot;brake cylinder 
paste&quot; (it's on their &quot;brake&quot; parts page).  I neglected to flush the 
brake fluid for way too long on one of my VWs and the cylinders 
got &quot;sticky&quot;.  Upon disassembly they cleaned up nice, no pitting, so now 
I'll be able to stop and not clobber anyone on the Berg Cruise to the 
MVVC Festival in a couple of weeks!

Anyway, thanks for all the help and advice!

Bill Bowman
