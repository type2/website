Subject: '59 Single Cab... front tranny mount conversion

http://www.type2guy_dot_com/59sc/59sc4.html

Yesterday I spent the day working on the front tranny mount on my '59 
single cab. It had the original split-case tranny in it when I got 
the truck.  I had yanked that tranny out a long time ago and even cut 
away the original front mount. But I had got &quot;stuck&quot; 'cause the 
shiftrod was rusted to the tube. After a long hiatus that problem is 
solved and I've moved on.

  I had decided to make a new front mount plate instead of using the 
adapter that is for sale. I wanted to keep the rubber front tranny 
mount instead of having it all bolted to solid steel.

I installed my refurbished replacement shift rod with new bushings. I 
kinda went by Ronnie's suggestion of how to make the new front mount 
plate. I used some 3&quot; wide 1/4&quot; thick stock plate steel. I cut a 
piece the width of the center cast part of the torsion tube. I 
centered the rubber mount on the plate and made 2 holes to mount it. 
I bought a couple of metric bolts from the hardware store and welded 
them onto the plate through the holes. I decided I wanted to get the 
plate as close to the torsion tube as possible, so went ahead and 
ground away the heads of the bolts from the backside of the plate. 
Then I re-welded the backside where the bolt heads were and cleaned 
it all up again. Solid as a rock! Working with thick ass steel sure 
makes it easy. Crank up the heat and get after it!

Next I needed to cut a couple of smaller pieces to fit from the tube 
to the new plate I made. See, the plate could touch the tube, but 
with the tube being round, it only touched in a small area. So these 
pieces were &quot;radius cut&quot; to fit the curve of the tube...then the 
plate could be welded to the straight other side of them. I guess it 
sounds more confusing that it is. Like Ronnie said, just start doing 
it and it makes sense.

So I welded up my little bracket edges to the torsion tube. I welded 
them right at the weld that connects the cast center to the rest of 
the tube. This was recommended by Ronnie to have one side welded to 
the thin metal of the tube and the other side to the cast center 
part. Best of both worlds.

Welding these little pieces on was hard for me 'cause of the small 
and awkward areas under there. But I did get them on with good solid 
penetrating welds. They're ugly welds, but are solid. Next I 
installed the tranny with the rubber mount installed and with the new 
mount plate bolted up to it. I lined up the tranny shifter with the 
shift rod centered in the tube. All this done under the bus. Then I 
tacked the plate in place from under there. I unbolted the tranny and 
rubber mount from the new plate.

With the tranny out of the way, I got after it all with the welder 
and made sure that sucker was in there real good. After letting it 
cool down I put some tape on the studs and then painted it all with 
some black POR-15. I poured about a baby food jar full and ended up 
painting on a good amount of the truck in there. That stuff has great 
coverage. I used up what I had and then let it dry.

While the paint dried I decided to sneak in a little body work. The 
truck had been picked up by a fork lift or something...not sure. But 
it had some bent parts on the bottom seam under the rockers. I worked 
on the drivers side of those for an hour or two and got it to an 
acceptable status. I'll have to weld in some patch metal to rusty 
holes later on, so plenty of future work still left in those areas. I 
was filthy from years of far west Texas dirt and old rust inside the 
rockers falling on me, so called it a day.

This morning I went and took a look. I have to say it came out pretty 
good. I shot some pictures of the whole thing and posted them here:
