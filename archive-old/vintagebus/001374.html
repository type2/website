I recently purchased a 58 ghia and on the 350 mile trek home, the fan belt
broke at the top of the mountain on the way into town...I coasted a bit and
where needed I started the engine and drove real conservatively... luckily
it was pretty cool out.  However, that didn't stop me a month or so later to
drive the 700 miles round trip in one day to Seattle and back for the
vintage meet with my 5 year old son :-)  We treat these things as adventures
and plan extra time and gear just in case...

Make sure you have a few tools with you, a spare fan belt, buy the idiot
book, etc...

and hey, stop worrying... you could be driving a newer POS car which when it
does break down you're totally helpless!!!
