Target locked, decoy vehicles in place, we have rust ignition, project BDB

--- Start BDB handshake ---
&quot;The Dove bluebird is OG.&quot;
--- End BDB handshake ---


Thom, under danger of exposing the truth, said:
&gt;&gt;The last I'd heard, the BDB (barndoor binz) had been covertly transported
to the Washington state area, maybe to the Boeing testing grounds?  A few
civilians reported seeing it, but those reports are not confirmed and the
civilians were labelled &quot;crackpots&quot; by the government, and subsequently
disappeared under suspicious circumstances.
