Subject: Cleaning the oil bath air filter?
Date: Wed, 14 Mar 2001 13:09:04 -0500
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

I have just read the air filter cleaning procedure in the library and am
wondering why kerosene is used?

Could mineral spirits be used instead?

Mine is filthy and in need of some R&amp;R.  I am willing to bet that it has
never been cleaned.


Thanks,
