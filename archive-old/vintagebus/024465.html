Subject: Rubber Baby Buggy Bumpers

We've had our '67 for a couple of months now and have just a few more
squeaks to find.
Two of them are caused by lack of rubber bumpers on the drivers door
latch and the rear hatch latch.  I'm assuming this because the passenger
door appears to have the only bumper left.  No one appears to carry a
replacement bumper and the guy at the counter at BFY said he needed one
for his bus, too.  While at the junkyard today I found that the early
bugs use a similar bumper.  The buses are 1 1/8&quot; long and the bugs are 1
3/8&quot;.  They fit the buses fine, but stick out past the mounting bracket
1/8&quot;.  But, then who cares, the rattles are gone. I got a bunch of them
since 2 or 10 were the same minimum price. If anyone needs a couple
contact me at babichrt_at_gte_dot_net.  Also, if anyone needs a replacement
spring for the rear hatch latch of a '67, I think the '68+ buses use a
similar latch and the spring is the same.  I'm going to be trying one in
my latch 'cause the spring is broke, but I'm having trouble getting the
latch off.
