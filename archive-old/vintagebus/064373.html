Subject: Re: [VB] Purple Single Cab

&gt; I saw a purple Single Cab being trailered on I85 in South Carolina.  Where
&gt; are the shows and events for the Southeast?

Go to the event planner on www.sevwc_dot_com for all the events in the South
East.  If you're into camping, also check out the events page at
www.fullmoonbusclub_dot_com.  Good luck, and hope to see you at some
shows/campouts.
