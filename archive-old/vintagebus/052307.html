Subject: Re: [VB] What ever happened to the five hundred dollar bus?

&gt; i think deals and cheap buses are still out there. 
&gt; jp has loads of stories about getting buses cheap. 
&gt; my favorite is the one about the cuban buses.

I think that the really cheap ones are getting pretty
scarce.  The &quot;Cuban busses&quot; referred to by Rachel were
three busses I got in exchange for a singlecab shell. 
It's quite a story, but in short, I got three (parts)
busses in trade for a singlecab shell that took me
five trips from Albuquerque to Cuba (New Mexico - 100
miles from here) to pick up.  (Ask me around the
campfire at BBB for details - Jon Furst and I were
threatened with jail on the third trip up there!) 
Then the guy gave me a subhatch Westy with a good
transmission to put in the singlecab.

The upshot of this whole story is that I just bought
back the original singlecab really cheap!

Other than these, I really haven't paid more than $300
for most of my busses when I got them.  I've got alot
more in most of them now!

For more stories, come by my campfire in Havasu real
soon!  Just look for the turquoise flipseat Westy w/ a
singlewheel trailer.
