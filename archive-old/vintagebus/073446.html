&gt; &gt;..... So, what do you get for a 44 year old double cab for it's birthday?


&gt;  I thought I would have Eric (my painter


&gt; &gt; friend) paint some flames on the narrowed spring plates for the double


&gt; &gt; cab. dove blue flames of course on the black plate, maybe a little bit


&gt; &gt; of pearl but I'll leave that up to Eric that likes to do flames.


&gt; &gt; . Flame suit on :-).......
