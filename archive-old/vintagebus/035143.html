&lt;&lt; Hello there...
 How would one go about mounting non stock rims such as empi 5 spokes to 
 a bus?  Are there problems with putting them on the rear wheels of a big 
 nut tranny?  Are there problems with the center caps or anything?  Are 
 there any offset issues with the rims that would pose a problem putting 
 them on a bus?

And would the same thing go for Raders? Theres a set on ebay I might be 
interested in? But thought I would ask before spending all that money.
