Subject: Re: For sale Arnold, Md Various Split Screen seats


&gt; I just imported a 75 Double Cab from Sweden and as
&gt; part of the transaction I am selling some stuff for
&gt; the guy.
&gt; All prices negotiable see website
&gt; http://www.angelfire_dot_com/dc/pflynn06/index.html
&gt; , also if you know how to ship a seat let me know.
&gt; Also a 36hp motor and a beetle pivot trailor for
&gt; sale
&gt; 
&gt; Stay tuned to here about the restoration of my 67
&gt; Westfalia.  Additionally I have an extra 65-67 tent
&gt; that I would trade for an original 67 poptop roof
&gt; rack
&gt; or sell for the right price.
&gt;
