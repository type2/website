Subject: Re: [VB] ebay barndoor item
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

So not only was barnoor spelled incorrectly, the items
are identified incorrectly?  So now some ebay sellers
have gone from saying either &quot;not NOS&quot; or &quot;it's better
than NOS, it's restored&quot; they just plain lie?

I'd be pissed if I didn't know those weren't barndoor
headlights (pre-60's that is).  I guess the seller can
get out of it by saying &quot;Yeah, I said they were
'bandoor' headlights, not 'barndoor' ones!&quot;

I learn more everyday from this list.  Thanks.

Paul
