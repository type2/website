Hi all,

To quote a famous phrase...&quot;Can't we all just get along?&quot;  A few of you
(you know who you are) need to quit the bickering and unwanted dialog and
all of us need to stick to more polite, helpful Bus content.  Please??? 
Thank you!!!

Speaking of Bus content, a while back I was given a cool, old, original
VWoA 6 volt battery.  It has a cool raise relief outline of the USA on the
side of the battery.  Inside the USA outline in cool vintage script are the
words &quot;Volkswagen of America, Inc&quot;.  It has a crack in the case and of
course, it's been dead and useless for decades.  I saw in an older issue of
Hemmings Motor News that some companies that will restore an old vintage
battery and can make them functional again.  So I'm planning to have this
one restored soon.  However I do need to locate a couple of the unique
filler caps for this battery and thought someone out there may have 'em in
their parts pile.  Some of you may remember these batteries.  The three
individual round filler caps are mainly made up of a sort of clear plastic
with a top insert of black plastic that has raised/relief lettering that
says:

FILL
TO
RING
ONLY

So please check out your stash and if you can find one or more of these
characters, give me an e-mail and make my day.  I'd love to buy at least
two to make this old vintage VWoA battery complete again.
