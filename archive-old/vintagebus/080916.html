Subject: Re: [VB] steering locks

I believe the lock cylinder is the same.   key IS same.  But I have not yet 
done this.

Anyone know if the guts (tumbler set only) from a 60's
bug steering lock will fit the housing of a bus
steering lock?   Both are made by neiman so i thought
they may be the same.   I have a few bus locks that
have bad tumbler sets.  Short of finding a sutable
replacment i was just curious if anyone has tried a
bug unit.

thanks
