Subject: Re: [VB] Warning

I too used my atm card and got taken for $1114.00 using Paypal.  I talked to
my
bank.  They reversed the electronic transfer!!  I got my money back, and I
never thought I would.  Talk to your bank, you may get a pleasant surprise.
One note, it has to be done within 60 days of the transaction.

Good luck, and don't go down without a fight.

&gt; Unfortunately, The deal was struck off of ebay after the auction had
ended. He had good feedback too. My &quot;visa&quot; is actually my ATM card with a
logo on it so I think I'm screwed. I do a have a Phone # and email and I
think he runs carsonline_dot_com.au
