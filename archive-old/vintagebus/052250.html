Hi Rich,
Good to hear of your multiple window rubber replacement success!  For tar in 
cloth use a hand goop type of product and an old toothbrush to work it into 
the tar spots.  This stuff works best if rubbed in when the cloth is dry of 
water and then run it thru a wash.  We have saved many vintage VW tee shirts 
this way that otherwise would have been thrown away.   Eric&amp;Barb
