&gt; Great, thanks for the info! I looked at my bus rims and they do seem to be 
&gt; a
&gt; different profile than my bug rims. So i think that they are correct.

Hi Jason,
You are welcome.  The bus rims have four slots in them between the inner and 
outer halfs of the rims where they were welded together.  The type 1s have no 
slots.

 But , &gt; i only have 4 of them. I guess i should find me a spare somewhere! I 
&gt; am in
&gt; need of some new tires for the bus, and i was thinking of going with those
&gt; whitewall Coker tires. Would those be ok on a bus?

Well, yes, and no.  We love the ride of bias ply tires, except thier tendancy 
to self steer if there is worn grooves in the pavement from too many tires 
and time between pavement resurface treatments.  Todays bias plys cost the same 
as the more pricey radials and only get about 1/3 (About 30,000 miles) the 
milage lifespan of radial tires in bus sizes!  Lastly if you run bias ply tires 
on long trips you have to make sure they are in tip top shape or risk having to 
get a complete set of radials, because bias plys are nowadays a mail order 
only item.  Mixing radials and bias tires on any auto is risky!  We did it once 
on our 1963 SC and it felt kind of like it was running in high heels.  
Steering had to be done constantly from moment to moment as it veered from side to 
side at highway speed!  This with nice tight steering!
