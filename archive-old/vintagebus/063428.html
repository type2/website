&gt;Here is what I found when I checked my turn signal switch w/test light. 
&gt;
&gt;Left turn signal on: white and yellow stripe flash
&gt;Left turn signal and brakes on: red and purple steady light

This is OK.

&gt;Right turn signal on: green, red, and white flash
&gt;Right turn signal and brakes on: green, red, and white steady

You're right; this is not a good result.

There are a couple of more tests you can do: Swap sides.  In other
words, interchange the green stripe and white stripe wires (front
lights) and the yellow stripe and red stripe wires (rear lights).
If this makes the problem swap sides (left rear turn signal doesn't
work, left front flashes real fast, right side works OK) then it's
pretty sure to be in the switch.  If the problem stays on the right
then it's in the wiring between the switch and the bulbs. 

You can also check out the bulb and wiring on each corner by unplugging
the green, white, yellow, and red stripe wires and touching them each
in turn to the black with green and white stripes wire.  You're
connecting each bulb individually to the flasher, bypassing the switch,
and each corner should flash as you do this.  If any bulbs don't flash,
the wiring, bulb, or socket on that corner are suspect.
