Dear Folks,

Jamie Rivers and I have been chatting by e-mail and we need more drivers in
the Great White North so we can plan the route up there. Phil Gowdy from
Strathroy has signed up but we need more folks to make this part of the Tour
a big event! We also have a couple in Manchester New Hampshire (it looks
like it's straight down I-89 from Montreal) who would like to participate so
if it would be possible to include them in a short loop through the Northern
U.S. now would be a good time. Speak up! It's your turn to shine! Remember
&quot;You're either on the Bus or off the Bus&quot;

Chris and Gus in Atlanta
