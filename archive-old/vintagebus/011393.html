Subject: Free rear bumper for '69 bus....
To: type2_at_type2_dot_com, vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

The subject says it all. It's got a smoosh in the center, but it
works. This is a blade only, as I'm keeping all accessories. 

It's in Portland, Or. I will drop it at UPS (shipping COD) for anyone
who wants it. I can e-mail an attached photo to anyone interested.


If interested, e-mail me directly and save the list bandwidth.



Jaime
