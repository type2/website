Subject: work on my 61...
Message-ID: &lt;Pine.BSF.4.10.10002111055320.25695-100000_at_users.anet-stl_dot_com&gt;

hi all,

I bought myself a 61 standard not too long ago... i have not yet posted a
trip report on the acquisition mainly because it was pretty uneventful.
(this time i put the bus on a trailer where all 4 wheels are off the road,
much better/calmer way to do it, but its not cheap to rent one...)

So anyway, ive been fiddling with it... last few weeks i got the popout
hinges unstuck.  They were rusted so they wouldnt open at all.

What i did was carefully heat them up with a torch.  Enough to get em hot,
but not enough to burn off all the paint...  a few bubbles here and there,
but these areas ned some paint anyway.

then i squirt em with kroil, and it gets sucked down in there. Then i took
a 2x4 bit that was as long as the hinge and put it against the hinge. This
gets teh force equally distributed along the length of the hinge so that
you dont tweak it.

Then you bash gently back and forth until it frees up a bit.  Then once
its moving you work it back and forth with your hands until it moves the
whole range of motion. Squirting some more oil in the process...

anyway, now on to the meat of the issue.

I pulled the drums last night.  the rear drums came of easily, no problems
there.  All inside the drum was as it should be.

Then i move on to the fronts...  Get the drums off and there are no shoes
or brake hardware.  WTF!

Guess someone took those parts for another bus and then put the drums back
on... wierd.

Anyway it looks like the passenger side bearing spun at some point as the
bearing slides on instead of being an interference fit.  I figure that
this will be okay as long as the clearance is no more than the clearance
allowed on a 64-67 bearing to hub. (vw did away with the interference fit
and went to a slide fit on the 64-67 with no major redesign in either
bearings or hubs.. so i will measure the spindle and the bearing inside
diameter and see what the clearance is. i think about 4-5 thou is allowed
in the 64-67 specs)

(i really want to use this front end as the king and links are tight and
no slop anywhere even in the center pivot... it'd be a shame to scrap it
before its worn out. Plus it has really cool tie rods and drag link,
grease fittings on each joint, and they are tight too :)  )

Problem is, i measured the spindle with my dial caliper and the readings i
got were about .030 off from spec.  this concerned me so i said hmm, ill
measure the good one and see what it reads.  It was way off too.  So now i
say to myself my crappy dial caliper from harbor freaight must be next to
useless.

Anyone have any suggestions as to where i can get some decent measuring
tools without breaking the bank?

peas,

Steve

p.s. if the spindle isnt even a good slide fit i have  67 front beam to
put in anyway... just want to try it as built for a while before upgrading
to newer stuff...
