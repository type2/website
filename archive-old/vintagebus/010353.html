It's doubtful you still have the original heads on a '66.  If the rocker arm
hold-down studs extend about 3-4&quot; down into the head then the correct
adjustment is .004&quot;.  If the hold-down studs screw directly into the head
casting right under the rocker stands then set them at .006&quot;.  With the
engine cold of course.  Most of the old .004&quot; heads with the long rocker arm
studs were converted to the short studs long ago.  I doubt there are many of
them left.  They didn't work well.  The studs wore against the head material
and caused oil leaks.
