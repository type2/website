hi greg,
        i have an extra interior but it would be impossible to ship.why?
because no way do i want to have to crate
it!! i also have a so23 flip seat.i am in the process of restoring the bus
and the interior.i have two complete interiors,
however i will be keeping the best components of each interior for my
bus.when i have completed my restoration
in the year 2033(just kidding),hopefully spring,i will be willing to sell
it.i don't now if this is too late for you but it is an option.
    good luck,
    woody
