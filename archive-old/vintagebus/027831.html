&gt;I always buy Bosch platinum plugs&lt;
I have not had great experiences with these plugs.  I have tried them in
type 1 motors and they seemed to foul because of a little oil consumption
issue.  Also I have run them in a Mazda 626 and Honda Accord and much
preferred the NGK copper cores, the Bosch Platinum were good at high RPM but
seemed to lack low end grunt.  I think this is due to the spark size being
larger on copper cores.  I have not run a 4 tip though which may do
better..?

&gt;When I bought a new Porsche 944 in 1983, the dealer warned me against using
synthetic oil, &lt;
This is kind of a weird recommendation for the engine.  For the 911 trannies
901 and 915 models dino juice needs to be used though, the synthetic is too
slippery and drains off the gears too well which causes them to loose
lubrication and wear prematurely.  I would recommend Mobil1 for any Porsche
engine application no matter how old/new it is.

&gt;  I got burned with a worthless electronic ignition kit for a vw, which I
bought from JC Whitney (yeah, I know) years ago. I've been shy about
spending my money on this type of thing ever since.&lt;
I got one of those Universal Corp Tiger 581 CDI modules and it broke too!
POS!  I have not had time to open it up and see what happened or complain to
Universal Corp.  The one good thing is that the Tiger CDI is switchable back
to points on the fly which is really nice, otherwise you would be there
picking your nose trying to figure out what busted for a few hours.  I have
given up on all this aftermarket made in Taiwan crap because it just does
not work, fit, or last like stock German stuff.
Points are easy, I am sticking with them.
