Well, I only found one...but it's definitely for sale!  I was on my way to
Home Despot this morning to get the last of the parts I need for my $150
tent when I passed a &quot;Donated Cars For Sale&quot; lot and here's this '62+
Yellow single cab.  It looks pretty straight at a 30mph pass, didn't check
the fender wells, but it's got baja 5-spoke rims on it.  Looked lowered a
little, but that could have been a trick of perspective.  I didn't get a
phone number of the place as I came back, but I got the address: 2265
Lafayette, Santa Clara CA.  If anyone long distance is interested in it...I
can go back and get their phone #.
