Subject: Pick a part

Finally got some junk yarding time in today.  Went to the Wilmington
(L.A. harbor) pick a parts today...there are two close
together...bastards charge you two bucks now...I'm insulted...asked the
guy when they raised the rates and with a blank stare he mumbled
&quot;uh....3 years ago&quot;.  Hmm, its been longer than I thought. Their prices
for some things are outrageous and others are cheep.  Late model bus
visors 11 bucks for two used visors, but a complete, solid barely rusted
T3 exhaust with the heater boxes still attached $12.99...go figure.

Sadly, no splits (never is), but did find a few air-cooled, mostly 70's
bugs and 3 or 4 busses.  For anyone that wants or needs a mid 70's
Riviera pop top camper interior, it's still all there and in perfect
shape...dometic frig/cooktop and all.  The pop top canvas looks brand
new and the top is in great shape.  No T4 running gear of any type no
front end either.  Who snags all the bus motor/running gear before these
things go out to the yard??

Bus content question:  While looking under a 70's Super, I noticed weird
oil lines coming off the oil pump and going to a small tank (upon future
inspection I realized it was for the autostick. I've never even looked
at an auto VW over so didn't realize the pump looked like that).  Is
there any reason one could not use that type of pump with the outlet and
return already plumbed into the cover of the pump to route oil to a
cooler or filter???  Why or why not?  

Steve
greasy but happy
