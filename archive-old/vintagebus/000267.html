 I still don't see why it's so hard to go to Radio Shack and buy a $6
 speaker and call it good.  I guess for some people that would double the
 investment in their buses, but at least you'd have some cool toons while
 waiting for your friend with a f*rd pickup and 50 feet of rope to pull you
 home...

If you want to really go whole hog buy a Bose.  Makes the old speakers sound 
like people with nasal problems singing into a tin can.
