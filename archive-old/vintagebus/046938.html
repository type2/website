&lt;&lt; I figure now that I'm this far that I'll just replace the birdys that 
Clara mentioned and maybe I should por-15 my shift rod while it is out.  Any 
reason why I shouldn't por-15 it.  &gt;&gt;
Hi John,
POR-15 the front shift rod should be fine.  The rear we would just polish, 
grease and reinstall with new rubber boots at the ends of the tube it rides 
in to protect it.

&lt;&lt; I have a couple that are part number 111 701 259 A and on page H-9 2 in the
 bently manual it says that those bushings can be  service installed in 
vehicles from chassis no. 631071 but I am 585 578 so .............. it won't 
work. &gt;&gt;
Again, if memory serves correctly we used this later front shift rod bushing 
on our 1960 without problem.  Could be that DPO had the later metal bracket 
shift guide piece installed and that might let the later bushing work with 
the earlier shift rod.

&lt;&lt; the rear two bushings are the badminton birdies, and they were changed at 
chassis 835 088.  the older version are smooth on the outside, the newer 
version have a ridge-&gt;&gt;
If we are figuring that chassi # out correctly that change should have 
occured about the third or fourth month of 1962 model year.  If memory serves 
correctly we used the ridged rear shift rod bushings from WW on our 1960 
panel camper without any problems so far.  The only thing we had to do was to 
carefully peel open these bushings and carve out the casting flash around 
locking tab that locks these bushings to thier position on the rear shift rod.

&lt;&lt;the rear shift rod was changed at that time and no they are not 
interchangable. &gt;&gt;
Think Clara means that only the rear shift rod is not interchangable.
