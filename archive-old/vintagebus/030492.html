Subject: japanese buyers

Not for nothing, but a dollar is a dollar. I had a 56 westy for sale for
8 months. No one in the USA wanted to come up with the money and a
japanese buyer through an intermediary did. I tried to sell my bus here
but if it does not sell here you need to do what pays the bills. Would
loved to have the bus stay here, but if it goes to a good home where it
will be preserved so be it. Just my two cents worth.
