&lt;&lt; Does anyone know where I can get hinges for my pop-out windows?
 1962 15 window.
 I have the glass and frames and the latches.
 Just need a way to mount them to my Deluxe.
 I got my bus with the windows out and hinges removed and missing.
 Two were there, the ones on each side of rear seat.
 Left side and cargo doors missing hinges.
 I have four pop-out windows sitting on the seat.
 I would like to get them in their holes.

 Also who makes the jail bars now?
 Where is a bar for the rear seat back?

Chris,

The hinges can be cut from &quot;piano hinge&quot; stock available at most good harware
stores. I found some stainless steel stock for mine and it works great on all
6!

I saw some guy mentioned in Hot VW's &quot;Transporter Talk&quot; a month or two ago
who makes or remanufacturers &quot;jail bars&quot;.  I found some old ones at a swap
meet. The tubing was pretty bad, so I tossed them and just kept the fittings
and the vertical center piece. The tubing is just aluminum tubing which is
easy to find and cut to length.

Jerry
