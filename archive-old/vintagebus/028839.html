Subject: re: [VB] Inspecting a tranny in the dirt 

Hey Andrew,

I got my last tranny from a local friend, after the previous one
completely went south. My friend had kept this tranny under shelter, but
apparently the previous owner kept it in a mud puddle outside...

The drums were locked up, as well as the shifter forks. It took me a
couple of days to loosen everything up... I got everything working well,
as far as I could  tell, on the ground. Installed, did a couple of
tranny oil changes, and it has been running fine ever since.

Good karma can't hurt, of course...

david
