A few things come to mind:

- how flat are the mating surfaces of the case?  A little rounding, or
  a slight dip (say, from filing/buffing off a burr or scratch), will
  definitely make getting a good seal difficult.
- how much sealant did you use?  If you can't see the metal underneath
  the sealant before you mate the case halves together, you've got too
  much.  That can cause multiple problems - leaks, bits of sealant
  getting squeezed into the engine and coming loose to block oil
  passages, etc.  The sealant layer needs to be as even as possible,
  as well.
- did you include the silk thread?  It's a Hoover trick.  You get some
  silk sewing thread, tease out one strand, and lay it into the
  sealant.  It takes care of any larger gaps that the sealant's not
  going to be able to handle, but squishes flat enough to not cause
  any problems with getting the case halves at the right relative
  positions.
