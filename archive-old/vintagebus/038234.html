Hi Chuck,
No, Westfalia did not install the small pop-up-tops in 68 and later busses.
But other camper conversion companys did. Like Sportsmobile, Riviera Line by
ASI, and possibly Sundial. In 1968 along with the redesign on the exterior
of the bus Westfalia also redesigned its pop-up-top to the cheese wedge
style full fiberglass top. The other camper conversion tops (small style)
put on splitwindow busses were still being offered well through the 70's. An
easyway to tell if it is a Westfalia is to check if the fiberglass top has
rounded edges and gold colored canvas , if it has square edges and yellow
vinyl or tan canvas then it is probably Riviera Line or Sportsmobile,
although if it has rounded edges but has three ridges or steps in the top
and seablue canvas then it could be Sundial. You can see photos of some of
the tops on our web site at, http://www.plfvw_dot_com/
Lastly if the 68 + camper has a Westy style small top then it was hacked in.

Hope this clears up the pop-up-top confusion.
