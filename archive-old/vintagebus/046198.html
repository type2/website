My old 58 singlecab has                  sekurit
My old 59 singlacab has (had?)       sekurit
My old 61 deluxe has                      sigla

My old 64 standard has                  sekurit

Thom needs a registry in his index to test this further.

&lt;&lt; THat passenger vs commercial distinction makes a lot of sense.   I thought 
that 61-63 buses all came with the laminated/sigla glass. But then I heard of 
and saw earlier buses with sigla, but come to think of it they were pass 
buses or campers.   56 deluxe has large logo SEKURIT.  60 DD panel had 
sekurit, 60 truck sekurit, 59 panel had sekurit, 59 truck sekurit, 58 DD had 
sekurit- most of the late 50s buses I have had were commercials.   61 deluxe 
has sigla, 61 standard sigla
