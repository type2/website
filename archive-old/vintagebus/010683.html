Hi Diana,
If you mean the sheet metal flange that the axle boot goes onto, then you 
really need to dissassemble the RGB and remove the axle tube to do the job 
right.  Make sure to have the proper amount of gaskets which shim between the 
flange and the tranny.  You want just enough gaskets/shims to allow the axle 
tube to slide up down, but not sloppy in outward.  Once you have the proper 
amount of gaskets/shims take the axle tube back off and apply high temp 
silicon sealant by finger painting onto each gasket/shim and reassemble.  
Make sure to torque the nuts on the axle tube flange to the proper amount!  
Too much will distort the sheet metal and require you to take it all apart 
and pound out the dents that you formed in the sheet metal flange.  Which 
sounds like you already have over torqued!    Eric&amp;Barb
