&gt;  &gt; Isnt 114 front seat belt mounts?
&gt;
&gt;  Yep, I messed up, so they are a front option, are they a rear/middle
&gt;  option?
&gt;  AL &gt;&gt;
&gt; I think they became standard for the back in 66 or 67.
&gt; standard in front in 64 or 65

OK I missed.
Front Mounts are 025 not 114 (6 pop outs). duh.
But as far as becoming standard.

A quick search on thoms database and 025 and 425 as well as the mysterious
426 show up in plenty of the 65-67 busses but not all.
025 also shows up with 425, 426 and 460 at times which are apparently all
3 us packages of some sort.
425 supposedly having to do with belts and mounts.
