He said the rounded style bumper came
&gt; out in 63 w/the change in turn signals.  I respect his
&gt; opinion but I thought that 66/67 rounded were those
&gt; years only.

65 is the split year. But as with air cleaners and dash lights, ther are
anomolies (sp?)...
I can just see the new load of bumpers from the bumper maker being
loaded into a storage room in front of a bunch of old style ones, and
when the hew were used up a few later buses got the old style ones newly
uncovered in the pile.

I have a  feeling that VW never in their wildest most halucinatory
octoberfest-beer hangovers guessed that a bunch of crazy nitpickers
would be discussing correct years for changes in bumpers over the
internet (der was?) some 35 years later.....
