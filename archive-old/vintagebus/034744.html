May 27 will be the Bug-O-RAMVA dinner the night before the Bug-O-Rama in
Sacramento Ca. This has been the event to put faces to screen names from the
online VW community. Everyone is welcome to attend and the more the better.
Last year there was a great turn out and hopefully this year will be even
bigger and better. This event will be held on May 27, the Sat. before the show
between 7pm and 9pm (gates at the track close at 10pm) at the In-N-Out Burger
at 2475 Sunrise Blvd., Rancho Cordova. Traveling on the 50 Fwy., exit at
Sunrise Blvd. and head north. The In-N-Out is on the right side of the street
Sunrise. So I hope to see everyone there it is always fun and we have a good
time, don't be shy we are all a bunch of &quot;VW Freaks and computer Geeks!&quot;
