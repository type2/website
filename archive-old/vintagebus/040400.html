If there ever was a perfect vacation, this one was it. Went over Goldie, my
'71 Westy, with a fine tooth comb and, finding nothing drastically wrong,
left Cincinnati, Oh. on June 20,2001. Up I75 to Lakeside, Oh. to pick up my
wife who was staying at a family cottage. It's amazing the transformation
that comes over me when I leave for a road trip- seems like total relaxation
and a mellow mind-set. Left the next day for a trip around Lake Erie.

Up SR2 to I75N and the miles starting melting away. Through Detroit Mi,
across the bridge and I was in Canada. Nothing very exciting to see, just
like any super-slab. Took 401 to London Ontario and stayed the night. Up
early the next day and on the road to 401. OOPS, should have stayed on 403.
After a slight delay, and a trip down Rt. 6, I hit 403 to the QEW to
Niagara, Falls. Stopped at John's Bug shop and then off to the camp grounds
for Buses by the Falls.

My hat is off to Jamie R. and crew for hosting a GREAT event.  Friday night
found us at a fantastic fire-works display over the falls. What a sight...
Back to the camp grounds for some serious relaxing and some cherries ( a
special blend about 80 proof). Saturday morning brought a great community
breakfast cooked by the Potts family.  After breakfast it was off to the
&quot;Maid of the Mist&quot; for a boat ride almost touching the falls. The view from
the bottom of the falls, the thunder of the cascading water, and the mist
floating up showed the true glory of Mother Nature.

Saturday night was the cruise-in at a local drive-in. I was amazed at the
how friendly everyone was and how nice some of the car were. It was quite a
surprise when I ran into someone from Cincinnati who had come up for the
show. After the cruise-in there was a VW caravan going by the Falls. Quite
an impressive sight to see a long line of VDubs parading through the streets
of Niagara. Back to the camp grounds for more relaxing and some serious door
prizes. More cherries and I was history till the next morning.

Got up- packed up- and then off to the &quot;June Jitterbug&quot; car show.  What a
treat!!! 220 car including 45 buses. Spent the day lounging by Goldie,
talking to a tremendous amount of very friendly VW people. This show was one
of the best I have been to and I plan on making this event every year.  Left
the show, after winning the &quot;long-distance&quot; award and headed S on the QEW to
Fort Erie. Stayed there Sun. night.

Monday morning left Fort Erie for Niagara-On-The-Lake, following the Niagara
Parkway. This is one of the most beautiful drives In a VW Bus I have ever
taken. The morning was bright and sunny, the bus was just humming along, the
scenery was beautiful, and all was right with the world.

Crossed over the bridge to the States and ended up in Buffalo, NW. I am a
goldsmith by profession and stopped at a gold refinery in the area that I do
business with. They gave me the grand tour and it was really impressive.
Left there and , driving back to I90, I saw a '70 bus with a beetle roof
section grafted on top. It was very well done and I will post pictures as
soon as I figure out how to do it.

Back to the cottage at Lakeside for 3 days of more relaxation and
refinishing the rack portion of my pop-top. Sadly, I had to make it back to
Cincinnati by the week-end.

The bus ran GREAT with no problems except bad gas mileage (an age old
problem that has haunted me since I started work on the bus).  There is
nothing I can think of that would have made this trip better. Looking
forward to the next one!!!!!!! TBear
