hey dude,
check the thinga magigger under the front floor mine hangs up all the time
if the pin going through it has any play in it at all it will go sideways
and hang up on itself i replaced the pin with a bolt with a washer on both
sides just snug enough to keep every thing in line

Subject: [VB] Sticking Throttle Lever on 34 Pict


&gt;Hey all!,
&gt;
&gt;Took the 67 westy out for her test drive. New front, rear brakes
(everything)
&gt;and front and rear shocks. Also a new accelerator cable. Still need to
bleed
&gt;some more, the new shocks are nice but look out! The throttle lever is
&gt;sticking and not returning.
&gt;
&gt;In addition to changing out my accelerator cable I also changed out the
lever
&gt;underneath the front floor board. This lever came with (2) holes to attach
&gt;the cable to and I guessed at the lower hole to attach it to rather than
&gt;upper hole on the lever which actually is a few mm closer to the rear of
the
&gt;bus, follow? Not sure if this is the reason for the throttle lever not
&gt;returning.
&gt;
&gt;Needless to say I hate running a cold engine at high revs due to my either
my
&gt;gas pedal not returning. Leaf spring under pedal long gone. Or I didn't
&gt;grease my cable enough, thought so the cable did have plenty of kinks.
&gt;Should the cable be taunt ? Do I need a new one? Should I have a spring
&gt;between the end of my accelerator cable and the fan shroud? I currently
have
&gt;the shroud that attaches to the fan shroud but should there be a spring to
&gt;help return the cable? The process I did was to pull the cable tight and
&gt;screwed it down. Was this incorrect?  Help!
&gt;
&gt;Thanks for your help.
&gt;
&gt;Virge
&gt;67 Westy
