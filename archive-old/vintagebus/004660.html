Subject: Re: [VB] Replacing your Jalousie window panes

Hi all,

I think I just got lucky, or...whatever.  I ordered replacement glass for my
jalousies yesterday....$115 for all pieces in tempered glass with all edges
seamed.  I measured carefully the originals, and also took them one pane of
each size for reference.  The thickness is 3/16&quot;, the length is 16 1/8&quot;, and
the height of the small panes is 2 3/16&quot;, the big ones: 4&quot; exactly.  I
noticed some variations in the originals, so these sizes are averaged to
within a sixteenth of an inch.

I am posting this because I was having trouble locating these panes anywhere
else that was affordable.  I don't know if this is a unique deal, but the
cheapest I could find in either tempered or laminated anywhere else was
$10/pane for all 20!

I replied to this message because it was a consideration....

&gt; I just completed making some replacement jalousie window panes and wanted
to share.  The original safety glass was all getting bubbles in it that you
cannot see through :(
&gt;
&gt; First I went to Home Depot and got a sheet of quarter inch
Plexiglas(really .22 inches and not .25), of course get a size that is right
for how many panes you need to make.  Quarter inch plexi is not cheap, so do
not go hog wild on the stuff...  I thought it was pricey for what it is
anyway.  Okay now set yourself up on a workbench or saw horses and mark a
template from the old window pane.  Now use a fine toothed circular saw or a
fine toothed bayonet (reciprocating) saw and start cutting.  Use fast and
accurate cuts otherwise the plexi will melt and you will have to recut the
same line.  You will probably make more than one so reuse the original glass
for another template and keep going,  if you use the plexi as a template
they will end up too big because your line will get a little fatter each
time.  Also keep the plexi steady and if it starts bouncing and clapping the
table stop, otherwise it will shatter.
&gt;
&gt; You can sand the edges if you want, but I think a good cut is all that is
necessary.
&gt;
&gt; Fitting them in is really straight forward.  The original panes seem to be
.2 inches thick so the plexi ones fit snug in the grooves when completed, be
careful not to knock the rubber friction pads out when putting the plexis
in.
&gt;
&gt; Now you are ready for summer camping!....  Just remember now people can
look in at you....  Drat now I need to make curtains and get the brake
lights working to be road legal.
&gt;
