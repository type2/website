Don't know about you, but I always hot tank and clean up/restore sheet metal
and paint and store. Exhaust parts I get are usually over the hill and get
trashed. Nuts, washers and bolts that were replaced that are still serviceable
get tanked and cleaned and put in my used hardware assortment by size and
type. I usually replace all  bolts, nuts and washers with new ones and even
the long case bolts. Every now and then I will throw together an engine for
some purpose or another and then I will use my nice clean sheet metal and
stuff out of my stock.

&gt; When overhauling an engine, the biggest problem is all the extra pieces,
&gt; what do you do with them?  Most people just scatter those pieces of tin,
&gt; intake runners, exhaust parts and everything else all over the shop, or if
&gt; they are somewhat organized, put them in boxes.

Pictures when you're done please!!  :-)
