I have just bought a 1960 westfalia the interior package is SO23 i believe.
On my M-Codes it say D23. My questions are what does this package consist of?

What does a driver side swivel seat look like? are they rare?

What color is SK 654C?

what does 372 mean?

And last what country and port is FR? I figured it was France or something
like that.
