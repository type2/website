Subject: &quot;Birth Certificate&quot; Question....

Hi All, I got my Birth Certificate!!!! and fast, but I have a question....
There is a spot for the engine number, they state the size of the engine,
but no engine number. The area where it should be, just says &quot;not
mentioned&quot;. Could it be that they don't have it? Or was I suppose to supply
it along with the VIN?
TIA
