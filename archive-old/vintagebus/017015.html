Where did they pull that VIN from?  You should be getting it from the 
tag on the passenger side of the front overhead air console.  Also
grab the numbers of the m-plate behind the passenger-side front seat.
Does it have any sort of popup roof?

&gt; Hello all. I'm pretty new to all this so bear with my questions :~). I'm 
&gt; considering buying a 65 Bus, and can't quite figure out what model it is. The 
&gt; VIN is 285097285. As far as I've checked, that comes up as a 7-seater 
&gt; sunroof, which this definitely is not. This is a Kombi camper conversion of 
&gt; some sort--but no louvered windows, all pop-outs. I wonder if anyone can help 
&gt; with this VIN mystery. I haven't seen the bus up close yet, so I'm going on 
&gt; pictures right now. Thanks...
