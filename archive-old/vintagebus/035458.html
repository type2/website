 &quot;flip&quot; it around for our needs?  anyone sell a 'proper' bus one? &gt;&gt;

Hi Craig,
To use a reserve tap in a non-BD bus you probably want to use a cable.  To do 
this you need a bus only reserve switch.  Instead of having the ball end like 
knob shaft for type 1 coming out of the reserve switch the bus switch has a 
round shaft with two flat areas machined on each side of the shaft.  These 
machined flats allow the use of the bus only cable arm on the reserve switch 
shaft.  If the new ones are backward in thier action you can carefully pull 
with a bit of twisting the brass tubes out and reverse them.  Best to loose 
the short tube, on the originals we just cut this short one off.  This short 
tube keeps a small amount of water/crud in the bottom of the tank.  It is 
alot easier for us to replace a fuel filter, drain the reseviour bowl in the 
carb or even clean the carb than to repair/replace rusted out fuel tanks.
 
&lt;&lt; anyone done this... places to drill, size cable to get, etc??  &gt;&gt;

Best you take a good look at a late 55-60 bus for how everything is set up!  
You just need to buy a reserve/choke cable from Wolfsburg West, buy or find a 
grommet for where the forward end of the cable exits the inside of the bus, 
you need to scavange up a anchoring arm that is welded to the bus just under 
the fuel tank to anchor the rear end of the cable sheath, and of course the 
bus only reserve arm with it's barrel clamp.
  If all of this seems to be too much trouble you should install just a 
reserve switch anyway and when you need it you can at least switch it by hand 
by reaching under the bus on the side of the road.  Also having a reserve 
switch in any bus is nice due to being able to shut off the fuel when 
removing the engine or worse yet when replacing all the flexable fuel line!  
Yes, no more laying in a puddle of fuel while your arm/s are covered in the 
fuel, waiting for a spark to light up you and your bus's lives!  The only 
preventive action needed with any reserve switch is to run the reserve 
postion every couple of months for at least a few minutes.  This allows the 
VW to suck in the little bit of water and crud down the carb.  If this 
water/crud is allowed to collect for long periods you will get no fuel, just 
a huge water/crud amount in the fuel reseviour bowl in the carb and end up on 
the side of the road draining the reseviour bowl and possibly cleaning the 
carb!  If the reserve switch is not used for even longer periods the little 
bit of fuel trapped in the unused side of the reserve switch will turn into 
jelly clogging any chance of you making it to the next gas staion when you 
need the switch to work!    Eric&amp;Barb
