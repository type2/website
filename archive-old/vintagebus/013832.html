A few folks have contacted me lately regarding the
Burleson Family Fund. Thanks to all who have already
contributed and are still thinking of joining the
bandwagon. The correct address for contributions is
posted below.

Send Cashier's check to:
Home State Bank
c/o Burleson Family Trust
40 Grant Street
Crystal Lake, IL 60014

Make Checks Payable to:
&quot;the Burleson Family&quot;

I would suggest a cashier's check for safety and keep
the receipt, if you wish, for tax time. There is an
appropriate line item within the tax long form for
Charitable Contributions. Also you might use certified
mail to ensure that you have a tracking method and
piece of mind that the mail was accepted/recieved by
the bank.
*It is not my intent to pump the list in any way but
only to provide information that has been requested.
This is not chain mail spam*

As of this date I have not ever heard back from the
bank or any representative of the Burleson Fund. It is
assumed that Tom has his hands full at the moment. If
anyone knows Tom or his present status, or has
pertanent questions please email me privately. Let's
keep it offline. Thanks!
