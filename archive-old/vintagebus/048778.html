Subject: '59 Kombi...Home-Made seat covers

A while back I posted pictures of the home-made interior panels I put 
in my '59 Kombi. I had got such a good deal on the vinyl material 
that I bought enough to cover my seats. The first priorty was the 
rear seat. Without a rear seat, i couldn't really drive around with 
the whole family.

For the rear seat, I had decided I wanted a &quot;Z-Bed&quot;. I found a bay 
window one that a fella gave me for FREE!!! This suited me fine 
'cause the seat went across the whole width of the bus. I also 
grabbed the seat belts. My wife insisted I put them in for the kids.

So this past weekend I found the time to remove the covers from the 
Z-bed. I cut all the seams loose and used the different pieces to 
make patterns for my new material. My wife sewed them together for me 
(her first REAL sewing job by the way). I re-installed them, painted 
the wood on the Z-bed white, and put it in the bus along with the 
seat belts.

It turned out really nice. If feels more like a couch than a car 
seat. The sun was going down, but I snapped some pictures and put 
them up here:
