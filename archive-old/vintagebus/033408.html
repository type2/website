Subject: '59 Kombi...Clutch cable problem?
Mime-Version: 1.0

Before I got my bus back on the road, I had to undue the wing nut that 
holds the clutch cable. I cleaned everything up so I could adjust by hand 
and then put it back on. Since then the play in the pedal has slowly got 
worse. Then today something happened and the play in the pedal drastically 
changed making it barely drivable. I'm at work now. I adjusted the pedal to 
get the play out. Only thing is now the clutch cable/pedal seems real 
squeeky and noisy. And going into first SEEMS kinda loud and growly. My 
idle is way too high right now, but it was that way before and I don't 
remember that much noise.

Any ideas on any of this?

Regardless I'll probably order a new clutch cable first thing tommarrow. 
Unless the cable is the same as a bug or something. Is it? Otherwise, I'll 
be talking to Ronnie at oldvolks_dot_com . I don't want to get stuck with a 
broken cable.
