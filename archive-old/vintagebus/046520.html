Does anyone know where I can get a set of those S-pipes so I can use a
bug muffler on my bus and have them clear the bottom of my bumper...
Peace, Love, and In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida,

&quot;The tires are the things on your bus
that make contact with the road....
Bummed is what you are when you go
out to your bus and it's been towed.&quot;...
