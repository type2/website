Aloha to the friendly and knowledgeable list members,

I will try to write in complete, polite, intelligible sentences because I
need your help. The metal reservoir on my Kombi is in need of
replacement. In a few short days I will be back on the US mainland to
prep my Kombi for shipment to Oahu in Hawaii. I have gone down to the
local library to search the vintage bus archives but did not come up with
any information on my master cylinder. I need to know if the plastic
cylinder my girlfriend bought for it at the FLAPS is a direct replacement
or if I need to order a metal one. I am hoping that the whole master
cylinder doesn't need to be replaced for this minor problem. Your kahua
(help) would be much aprciated.

The metal reservoir is ancient, and de to water retnetion in the brake fluid
corrosion is not uncommon.  Actually I am more surprised that it has been
functional so long.  I doubt the metal version is available now.

I believe the plastic reservoirs bolt on.  If not, a new MC is only about
$30.
