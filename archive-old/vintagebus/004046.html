cause

    I guess you two haven't been having any fun with VWs in general then for
at least the past 15 or 16 years.  Pull out those back issues of Hot VWs
from around '85 or '86 and you will find a feature (I believe a cover
feature at that) on Eddie's resto-custom bug (before anyone called it
&quot;resto-custom&quot;).  I recall the cover said &quot;Eddie Van Halen's Bug!!&quot;.  It was
a gray rag top with a stuffed Pink Panther toy in the back seat.  If anyone
knows which issue exactly, please let me know.  Mine are packed away at the
moment so I'm unable to check myself.  He's been a VW guy for years.  He may
have strayed from the &quot;fold&quot; for a decade and a half, but he's back!!

    Hey, if he wants to buy a bus and paint it like his guitar, I say &quot;Go
for it!!&quot;.  After all, it's HIS_BUS he can do what he wants with it!!
YOUR_BUS though, is entirely up to you. . .

    Now pardon me while I get back riveting on those fiberglass
ground-effects panels on my barndoor . . .  'Just LUV that Mullholland look
:-)
