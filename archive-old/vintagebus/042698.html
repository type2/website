&gt; Hi Steve,
&gt; The 1959-67 starter strap was the same as your 1967 one.  The 1961 one of 
&gt; yours is a DPO add on, but should not hurt!  Unless your bus is going to be a 
&gt; show bus or trailer queen keep the 1967 RGBs and just install a 1964-67 
&gt; (1966-67 are best) front beam.  This will keep the higher geared reduactions 
&gt; and give you brakes 20% bigger all the way around.  Eric&amp;Barb

My 61 transmission had only a gorund strap from the starter to the
chassis, no strap at the front of the transaxle, the 67 box had a strap
from the front of the transaxle to the front transaxle mount... Since i
got  this tranny out of the bus i am unsure if it ever had a strap from
the starter to the rear tranny mount. Also if there was supposed to be
another ground strap on the 61 box it was a dpo mod and missing :(

As for the front beam, i have had a 67 beam in it for the last 8k miles,
just never got around to putting this transaxle in (out of the same donor)
(the original 61 beam was mangled, never even used it...)

As for bigger rear brakes making that much of a difference, i dont think
they really will as 75% of the braking is done at the front, so a 20%
improvement in the rear brakes is really only maybe a 2-5% improvement
overall... im not sure...

take care,

Steve
