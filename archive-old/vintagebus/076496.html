Subject: Help with 9 prong  box Flashers,please

First off thanks for the help with the wiper switch.  Seems it was a combo of
loose connections and bad ground.  Went through everything and got them to
work.  I now have Headlights, Turn Signals and Parking lights.  Haven't hooked
up the brake switch yet.

Here's the issue with Hazards;  I don't have any, with the ignition switch off
I pull the Hazard switch and nothing.  With the Ignition switch on the Hazard
switch light will flash.  Nothing blinks front or back.  Turn signals work
like they should.  I tried another 9 prong box and it flashed rapidly, made a
strange noise and eventually the turn signal light would stay on until I
turned it off with the indicator switch.  When I pull the Hazard switch with
that one it would do the same as the turn signals; blink rapidly, go solid and
make noise.  Ok bad 9 prong.

With this one everything functions but the Hazards.  Is it possible for just
the Hazard function of the 9 prong to fail and the rest not?  If so is there a
work around so I can the 9 prong in place for the turn signals and get
flashers to work or should I just use one of Matt's solutions in Type2_dot_com?

Dave
