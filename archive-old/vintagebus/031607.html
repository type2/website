I'm never one to through something away but I just through out one of those
linkage set-ups that I had removed from an engine. The main problem was
carbs going out of sync dure to cable stretch and I find the cross bar
linkage just fine and trouble free.

Last week someone reported that they had made a linkage for dual Kadrons
that were cable operated. I've been thinking about this and it seems like a
great solution to the expansion - contraction problems with a push pull
linkage. Now that that message is long gone, I'm thinking of doing something
like this. Would the person who posted that message please p-mail me?
