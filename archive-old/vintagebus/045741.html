&lt;&lt; i have it tightened down good again, but how much damage can the drum 
being able to move on the splines do? (i/e the drum is now gone, but can i 
ruin the stub axle?) &gt;&gt;
Hi Steve,
Until the drum splines wear out and leave you stranded due to that side of 
axles just spinning!  If you do not use a cotter pin to lock the axle nut 
this could automaticly unthread it!  The drum is made softer than the stub 
axle so the drum gets most of the wear in situations like this.  Eric&amp;Barb
