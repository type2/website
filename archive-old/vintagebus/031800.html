Did anybody notice on this bus that the side door swings open, not down like
on my old side loader. This could have been one of those repair trucks with
a seat in the back and a small tilt for the workers, somewhere on Vintagebus
or the Planet is a photo of this style of truck.

&gt; Not only was it a side loader, it had doors on both sides.  It got hacked
up
&gt; too!  Where is Kelly when you need him?

Double Damn!!!  I didn't see that.  If any bus was a candidate for
restoration, that one should have been.  Even Ronnie's mint condition side
loader is only on one side.  It's a shame that one was let go for so long -
that would have had to have been a special order then didn't it?

&gt; Did you see the long load trailer that is on Dropgates_dot_com??  Its under
&gt; accessories.  There is a link to a German site. I would just about trade
my
&gt; Westy (project) for one ;-)  Of course #10 is &quot;thou shall not covet&quot; so I
&gt; guess I'll have to make my own ;-O  That thing is SOOOOO cool I can't
stand
&gt; it.

You bet I did - that bus with the swivel in the bed and the trailer behind
it?  I would love to load up some Parallam beams at work and haul them to
the jobsite on that setup.  It'd be fun just to haul a telephone pole around
on it and to shows.  You'd be a hit then!
