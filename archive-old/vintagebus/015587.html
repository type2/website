The crankstart was used all the way thru the end of
the 36hp engines on the buses which was mid `59 when
the bastard engine started.  So yes all early 36hp
engined `59s had crankstart equipment....and for the
next yet asked question...yes there was also a longer
crank start handle as with the newer style bumpers the
crank handle had to be longer to clear the wider new
style `59 bumper.

I have seen and owned a couple of these buses.  It is
also verified in my `50-`67 VW factory parts manual.

Now does anyone have the specs for cutting the
tailight holes?  I have yet to see them...Robert Davis
you out there???

&gt; &gt; Hello--
&gt; &gt; The chassis number is 457 113. I had no idea there
&gt; was a height difference 
&gt; &gt; mid year? It is an early 59' panel built in early
&gt; April and has a crankstart 
&gt; &gt; apron?
&gt; &gt; I really have no clue,  that's the first i've
&gt; heard of height difference and 
&gt; &gt; the taillights were hacked w/ 62-71 lights when I
&gt; got it--
&gt; &gt; could you make me a trace if that's what I need ?
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Thanks alot--Pete
&gt; 
&gt; think you get the low version taillights- just by
&gt; the overriders,  not sure of exact placement off
&gt; hand, 
&gt; 
&gt; .. but  I find it cool that you have the crankstart
&gt; apron.  Does it seem original to the bus, ie same
&gt; colour (s) et al?   Because the crank handle /start
&gt; was dropped, supposedly , at the end of 58, when
&gt; they switched to the sturdy non-stamped bumpers.  
&gt; But I had an early 59 , that had the splitcase
&gt; tranny and was originally 36hp, and had the original
&gt; crankstart apron.  Same sealing wax red as the
&gt; engine compartment on the inside, same aqua as the
&gt; outside of the bus on the outside.  (also cut for
&gt; pea shooters, and the bumper had two tailpipes
&gt; sticking through it- the John Muir special)  Anyway,
&gt; haven't heard of anyone else having a 36hp 59 with a
&gt; crank apron, and have been ridiculed for suggesting
&gt; mine came with the crank apron  :(
&gt;
