&gt; That's interesting .... The Westfalia factory sprayed glue on the interior
&gt; metal and stuck the insulation there and not on the wood panelling. So
what
&gt; is the difference between the old factory insulation and &quot;new&quot; home
&gt; insulation that would cause rust??

&gt;
&gt; &gt; Be careful if you are using home insulation on a bus.
&gt; &gt; I have a remarkably rust free midwest bus that I am
&gt; &gt; restoring.  The only major rust was in the doors and
&gt; &gt; it was caused by moisture held in by the pink
&gt; &gt; fiberglass insulation.  Any insulation should be
&gt; &gt; attached to the inner door panels and not the metal.
