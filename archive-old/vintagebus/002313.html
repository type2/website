  HI Volks,
A friend of mine Tom here in Havasu just bought a '63 DD Standard Microbus.
It's 'very' complete, inside &amp; out.  I posted a pic on my web page, sorry
for the slow loading page I'm just learning how to 'thumb' pics.

The codes are:  vin #988063
                              374-unknown
                              025-lap belt anchors
                              195-unknown- US Specific
                              209-Seating for 9 people ( double cargo doors)
Needless to say he is excited with his new project!  The bus needs rockers
and the drivers rear quarter has been banged badly but it's OG paint,
interior and engine, which runs great.
Any info out there on the unknown codes?  He would like to know
if this is a fairly rare bus.  Any way of finding out how many were made?
 Tom is excellent on restoring VWs and will do a super job.  His wife owns
the red '62 'vert that was on the cover of RMMW and in HVW mag. a while 
back. 
Hey JP does Berry have one like it?  
Lou in Havasu
