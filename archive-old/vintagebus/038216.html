Bill,  Thankyou for your response.  I have had a nice correspondence
with Todd S. about the same matter of slamming. This is Dawn and My
first experience dealing with Mr. Heard and the SOTO club.  We are
members of NEATO and our local branch The Cascade Kombi's.  I know SOTO
has had difficulties in the past but I was unaware of its extent on its
own members.  My original closing statement reflects that ignorance.  I
do think airing difficulties with unreputable people, organizations, or
businesses on the list is a Good thing.  I will remain impartial to the
whole SOTO slamming forum due to my limited exposure to SOTO/ Dave H.
(FIN)

Free Speech is the gateway of democracy!
Everyone have a GREAT Fourth of July weekend! :-)

Gone on Holiday till Monday.
