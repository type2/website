Subject: Swap 16&quot; barn rims for others?

Greetings All.

I have three 16&quot; rims in good condition,  although needing
a clan and paint.  All are dated 1954.

I was wondering if anyone would be interested in working
towards a trade/deal on four 15&quot;  5.5&quot; or 6&quot; wide five pattern
'hot rod'  rims (what have you got lying around ?).

I'm in Australia so some freight cost/hassle would be involved.  I
would be happy to pay freight on the barn rims and send .....

I'm hoping this doesn't sound too ludicrous but 16&quot; rims are very
hard to find here and worth a bit.  I understand they could be more
plentiful (and thus worth less)  in the US or UK.....

Always happy to receive a bashing/opinions on this too 8-)..

regards

RobK
