yes, this has happened to me on more than one occasion.
the first time was in the mountains of tennessee.  the 66 was
at a slight angle and dripping steadily from the drain;  but nothing, of
course, 
in the engine compartment. then last week I had just filled it, then 
drove 20 miles when it happened again.  much more gas this time.
exactly as described in Bob L.'s  previous post.  a bit of a shock if
you're not used to a deluge of gas like that.  just glad I'm not the
only one.
