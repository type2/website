Said JoeJd13_at_aol_dot_com:

&gt; i paid 12.95 for mine   (east coast)

Same here, last night at the Tallahassee FL Wal-Mart.  I forget who was
talking about having to go to the top &quot;ask for help&quot; shelf and look way
in the back.  Exactly the same for me - they had a total of about a
half-dozen of the others, but only one bus/beetle, and it was on the
bottom in the back of the top shelf.  Sheesh.

There are two other Walmarts in town - I'll see what I can find.  I'm
thinking my Franklin Mint cabrio beetle would look pretty cool on the
trailer. ;-)
