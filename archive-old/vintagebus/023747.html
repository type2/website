Subject: Engine internal pressure?!?!

Took a short trip from Ottawa, Ontario to Nova Scotia this past week.
Lovely area, incidently.

Anyway, on the way home, pulled a bonehead manuver and lost the oil
filler cap.

No prob, says I and make a tinfoil cover and a clamp to hold it on.

Drive for about ten minutes and pull over just to check things out, and
sure enough, the engine is again
completely drenched in oil...the tinfiol cover has a hole blown through
it.

I was under the impression that the case pressure (we aren't talking oil
pressure here, I think)
was very low yet in this engine (1641 hydraulic) the pressure was enough
to blow through 4 layers of tinfoil.

Comments appreciated.

...Markus


Conclusion:

We stopped to check things out in a little old gas station.  I asked if
he had any oil caps and he handed me a large
box full of gas caps etc.  My SO sat on the stool behind the bus to see
if there was something that might fit.

10 minutes later she says she had something.  Obviously a gas cap, but a
decent fit.  Looked kinda familiar.
Sure enough, an exact match for the gas cap on my '66.  I'd wanted a
spare anyway.  What are the odds?
