Subject: Pomona 

&gt;One of the best Pomona's I ever had, why I don't know, could it have
been
&gt;the Westfailure drawing all the people over?

It must have been me. When I left, you said you had'nt made a dime and
still owed Kyle 200 bucks. I'm good luck ;-)


&gt;Man, and that's what you get for not being able to make it to every
show or
&gt;swap you want to.

You never had a chance. Ronnie had the inside track on it and said he
almost trampled people to get it ;-) Besides, he bought it the night
before. Thats when all he good stuff gos. All the sellers prowl the rows
the night before and before first light. You can still do well if you
get there by 5am though.

I spent every penny I brought....a first for me. Saw Ronnie and picked
up a set of main bearings to double check the ones I bought. I found a
few deals on new  parts for my motor. A brand new 30/31 for 70 bucks and
a new DH cooler for 40. I bought out a guys stock (all of 5) NOS small
hole heat riser gaskets for a buck. My big ticket item was metal 4 leg
rack for my double cab. One foot is damaged, but for $125 its a easy
fix.

Hey, anyone pick up a flyer from the guy on the (East) end of a row who
was selling parts and was hawking a powder coating service. He is in
Hyland out in the San Berdoo area. His prices were great, but I lost the
flyer.

Steve
