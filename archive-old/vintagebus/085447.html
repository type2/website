Subject: Rebuild/Trip Report - long time coming... Details

Thank you all for the comments and suggestions.  E&amp;B indicate that a temp 
over 220 is generally not that good, so it looks like I have some work to do 
before I end up burning this latest rebuild (which is actually my second 
with this engine case within ~4 years).

Here are some more pseudo-vitals on my '63 bus engine:
- Single port 1600 which I am told gives me about 43HP... awesome.  :o)
- Single carb, nothing fancy.
- Single tip exhaust.
- All the engine tin is in place, although it could be a little better 
condition... a couple of the bolt holes are worn out on the bottom of the 
engine.

My mechanic suggested that I use some high-heat silicone to seal up all the 
contact points on the tin.  That should clean up some of the airflow... but 
I can't imagine it has an effect of buying me the 10-50 degrees that I need 
to trim... or would it?

I will try some of the other suggestions from E&amp;B as well (make sure my temp 
gauge is accurate, new pulleys, doghouse shroud, etc.).  I'll let you all 
know how it turns out.

One more tidbit about the trip.  In Idaho Falls, after some noted high 
temps, I checked the archives from a hotel computer and saw that some 
believe synthetic oils would lower temps through lower friction (smaller 
particles, blah, blah, blah).  So, we went to the local Quickie-lube and had 
them drain the oil and add in the synthetic.  Honestly, I have no idea if it 
helped.  I still had the same high temps on the way home.  Likely it is due 
to other cooling issues, but it might also be a bunch of hooey too.  There 
wasn't a lot in the archives that I could find, and it was kind of dated, so 
perhaps we can strike up the discussion again?  Does synthetic oil help keep 
these vintage bus engines cooler?
