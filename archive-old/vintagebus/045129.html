&gt;I can't seem to find any info on the 'net about the Jarome Jamboree.
&gt;Could someone either tell me where to look or else send me some info &gt;via
&gt;e-mail?  Mostly I just need to know when, but any other info would be
&gt;nice too.

The Jerome Jamboree VIII will be held September 12/13.  To my knowledge there
is no website for the event.  It may well be that the Arizona Bus Club, the
sponsor of the event, will have a web page at some point, but it is doubtful
that this will happen prior to the event, it's only 7 weeks away and an
enormous amount of work must be done.  This event may well see 400 buses this
year.  As the date draws nearer it will be posted on the list, as many listees
are members of ABC.  If you have more specific questions, e-mail me off-list
and I'll do what I can.
