to us:   &gt;&gt;  &gt; Wow 
&gt; that will teach me to write and press the button without refering to the 
&gt; drawing !
&gt; I just checked  we are both wrong !
&gt; I was wrong to say 24mm in to the fisrt 2 holes. That should have been 24 
&gt; mm the first knuckle length (at each end- thereafter the knuckle length is 
&gt; 30mm) 
&gt; You are right  the first hole is 10mm (actually 9.25 on all 3 originals of 
&gt; mine but thats nit picking, but I know how every one loves to nit pick!  
&gt; Anyway you can lay our new stainless hinge over an old VW hinge and all 
&gt; holes and knuckles are EXACT. Therfore I stand by my comment that they will 
&gt; pick up on an original captive nut strip.
&gt; Weve also even got the 5mm rad on the lower corner of the lower hinge flap 
&gt; this time. I did make the tool to flare the countersink on the top hinge 
&gt; and although it was perfect in a steel hinge it caused distortion in a 
&gt; stainless hinge so this is ommited on our  production windows.
&gt; It is interesting to note that out of the three set of original safaris i 
&gt; have the bending points and leg length very slightly. This could be due to 
&gt; two reasons. Material slipping in the tooling when being formed or , more 
&gt; than one set of tooling/machines manufacturing safaris. If any ones around 
&gt; who worked at the factory.....
&gt; Another interesting point. I was loaned a NOS set of VW safaris (still in 
&gt; the box !)
&gt; which I borrowed to cross check our jigs and a pile of old  originals ive 
&gt; gathered over the years. When offered to a never repaired bus in my shop, 
&gt; they were miles out of being parrallel on the vertical sides. It would not 
&gt; take much of a gently tweek to get them correct but it showed me that even 
&gt; VW safaris needed to be &quot;fitted&quot;.
&gt; Another fact is that the same set fitted another bus better. Buses vary bus 
&gt; to bus. No robots and computors. Hope thats of interest.
&gt; To answer the question about fitting VW tops to our bottoms. Ive done this 
&gt; several times for UK customers with the old steel frames we made. I 
&gt; normally asked for the top to be sent to me and I fit them. This is 
&gt; normally because the steel joint is so rusted or the screws are snapped off 
&gt; that most customers would be stuck for repairing. Normally the ends of the 
&gt; safaris are damaged where people cant get them apart and start sticking in 
&gt; screw drivers etc. I would be prepared to repair the odd set but they would 
&gt; not have the double wall. 
&gt; The new ally double wall is still externally the correct shape and matches 
&gt; VW. however I have chosen to make the joint section rectangular and the 
&gt; slot in the new extrusion rectangular. This way we get perfect alignment of 
&gt; the two halves. As no one can see inside the internal section, I cant see 
&gt; this as a problem. (except for the nit pickers who will no doubt have sleep 
&gt; less nights over it). 
&gt; Does any one have a good original captive nut strip to loan or send a 
&gt; drawing ? I will make the inserts and if customers want them , well include 
&gt; them. 
&gt; More views on fitting this ...who wants to  ???
&gt; Always interested to talk Safaris

&gt;&gt;me again,
how are you going to weld the captive strip when youve tightened up the 
window in the right place ? you cant get at the strip to weld it ???

Hi Dave,
Thanks for the very interesting info on your repro safaris!  They sound as 
good as the originals, and hopefully less prone to corrosion.  We have a bad 
copy of the Shop Bulletian on installing safaris, but can not find it right 
now.  Darn!  If we remember correctly VW suggested the shops weld the plate 
in place or risked having the nut plate strip fall away and disappear 
whenever the safaris were removed for repair, or body work on the bus.  We 
would make the nut plate strip about 50-60mm longer than the safari hinge.  
When drilling the slightly larger holes in the upper body frame for the 
mounting screws to go through, we would drill two extra holes outside of the 
hinge length.  Once the nut plate strip and window are screwed together and 
adjusted for proper fit inside the one could mig weld these two outer holes 
to the nut plate strip, or drill and tap it for two extra much longer screws. 
 If one installed these two extra screws one could adjust slightly the 
safaris if needed later.  Especially if a replacement seal was not quite 
sealing in an area or another.  Also using anchoring screws for the nut plate 
strip would reduce the amount of welding needed that could marr glass and 
other interior components with welding splatter.
  By the way are you volks producing a outer seals with molded corners as the 
originals for increased sealing in these areas?
  Thanks again, Eric&amp;Barb
