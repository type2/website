&gt; Dear Folks,
&gt; &quot;Something I have never seen on the list is a List Name Tag
&gt; I have seen ,,, see me at the Yellow bus at 10..  etc,,

I guess you weren't on the list as of last year.  Craig S. made up name tags on
CD rom labels for folks at last years OCTO.  I got mine (too late so I had to
manually print mine :-!) as did a few others.  A bit of a stigma, but you can't
miss people with a big honk'n white donut on their chest.
