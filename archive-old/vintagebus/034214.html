Subject: BUSES by the BRIDGE IV news!! FLASH
Date: Thu, 20 Jan 2000 21:05:31 -0800
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

Terry Delaney of the LONDON BRIDGE BULLIS has donated his 1966 WESTY
walkthrough camper to BUSES by the BRIDGE IV to be auctioned off to the
highest bidder, no reserve, no ebay, this bus will be sold and all the
proceeds donated to the Arizona Abused Childrens Home, so sorry for those
that won't be there and somebody will be driving home in a pretty nice Westy
camper.

BBB IV starts tomorrow and people are already arriving for the festivities,
caravans have left from points across the country and will be arriving
tomorrow, we will be posting pictures and updates of the weekend on the web
for those of you who can't make it, so at least you see what your missing
and can start planning for next year.

gotta go, thingd to do, people to see and places to go
