Subject: Re: [VB] Front Shift Rod Coupling: Why cut/weld rather than 
  tap?

Couldn't you cut a two hole coupler apart into two one
holer's?  Also those red plastic (what do you call
that stuff?) aftermarket rear couplers actually will
replace the front one (same center to center grub
screw measurement - I checked).

&gt; I had got a repro front coupler for my 61 (2 screw)
&gt; from WW.   It worked, but 
&gt; the ID was larger than it ought to be.   For a piece
&gt; of pipe with a couple 
&gt; holes tapped in it for $8 I expected a nice fit.  Oh
&gt; well, it did work.   Are 
&gt; the single hole couplers available?
