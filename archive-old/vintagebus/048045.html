&lt;&lt; I use Rain-X Anti-Fog.  It works great, but you'll probably need to 
re-apply
 it every few days or once a week. &gt;&gt;
do you gat alot of glare at night using that brand? I used some anti fog/rain 
stuff a few years ago and swore it off afterwards due to the glare it caused. 
Also have heard it said (by more than one) that you can cut a potato in two  
and rub the juicy part on the window. never tried it though.
