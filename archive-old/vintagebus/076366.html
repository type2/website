Subject: RE: [VB] Re: Vent Wing Window Problem

Hello Everyone

	Well I got the frames painted again and I checked around today
and found an old school auto glass guy. He told me to bring the frames
to him and he would help me out. He had different size rubber thickness
similar to what WCM sells and I will probably go with something a little
bit thinner. I will find out Thursday or Friday if we can get this done.
I will keep you posted.


Thanks again for everyone's responses on this one,
Eric


I've used bicycle inner tube.  might have had to double it over.
