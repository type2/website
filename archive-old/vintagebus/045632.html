&lt;&lt; Speaking of cots, can anyone describe (length of poles, color of canvas,
 shape of poles) what the cot for a pre 68 Westy looks like?  &gt;&gt;
Hi Steve,
What year Westie would you be talking about?  There were at least three 
differant pre-1968 models!  Plus for the record there were at least two post 
1967 Westie hammocks and one pre-1968 Sundial hammock that we know of!
