well everything seems good on the engine now...set the timing statically this
afternoon, will try to hook up with my friend this weekend and try dynamically
timing it.

seems real smooth and quiet, can't wait until i finish the interior(hopefully
next week)then it should be extra quiet.

I think i will try to take it for a little jaunt down to galveston this
weekend, i think it is about an hour away(i haven't been for a while).

thanks to the list for all your help....you guys are great!
