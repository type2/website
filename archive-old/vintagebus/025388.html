I have had a chance to install a few sets of Izz's windows and have had
the same problem with the window cracking.  If yours cracked where the
two frame pieces come together the reason is, when you pull the safari
in by the latches and close the latch down against the tab the frames
flex a little.  Original safari windows when taken apart have a inner
channel that the glass rides in.  This channel also makes the frame
stronger and not flex when closing down the latches.  Izz's windows do
not have this channel and that is why your window cracked.  It doesn't
have to flex much to make the glass crack.  I have noticed also on a few
sets that when screwed into the bus one corner and the opposing corner
will fit great, but the other corner and the one opposing it isn't even
close.  Has anyone experienced this problem.  I thought it might be the
bus we were installing them in but when I compared Izz's windows to a
perfect set of originals, Izz's were shaped different.
