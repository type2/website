Just a thought. Shortly after I entered the world of busses and read about how
neat a 009 was, I thought that I had to have one. When installed and adjusted,
I noted that there was perhaps more power (old rule of car tuning--anything
that you do will make the seat of the pants judgment feel better).  BUT I also
noted that drivability went away. Instead of just mashing on the gas for more
power, now I had to gently coax the throttle or it would stumble badly.
something about needing a different advance curve for a heavy bus vs a lighter
bug. I read in Bob Hoover's sermon (when we could still read them) some about
this. I put the old double vacuum dizzy back on, replaced the points with a
hall effect device, added an electronic control module and the drivability is
now great. More power??? don't know. With a stock 1600 DP I can rev to 4800+
rpm in 3 rd gear and easily top an indicated 85 mph in 4th.
Just a thought. replace the 009 with the stock dizzy, hook up the vacuum tubes
and try it.
