Sending hate mail is silly.
My mistake for attributing Rikki to the bus. Beat me
and make me drink beer the next time that you see me. 

I was supporting the look and efforts. Pmails between
he and I clarified that the bus &quot;originally was an
American 13 window, 1966, it's the one that Mark
Maskery started before he went off to Australia, he
sold it to Al, the guy who built the now orange, denim
interior slammer. He has now turned it in to this wild
creation.&quot; (per Rikki J.)

Ellis sez- Kudos and support to all involved. I
thanked Rikki for forwarding the shots to VWPlanet and
mentioned that it was great. Exposure to trends and
efforts world wide is what the internet is all about.
Hurray! =) Everett did not name his domain
VW-WestCoast-USA. Wise choice Ev.
To me it looks like a popular trend is in the *Well
Executed and finished* &quot;Super Retrocustom&quot; panels and
deluxes. A breath of fresh air!

&quot;Super Creative Retrocustom&quot; = (SCRC) new term coined
here! Creating what VW didn't in a way that looks like
they did ~or better.

(SCRC-d)=scrc-deluxe
(SCRC-p)=scrc-panel
(SCRC-ddc)=scrc deluxeroofed dblcab

Perhaps Hammill and Metwizard can join in on this
trend with their skills and show us some more fun
stuff.

(My first VW was a slammed &lt;I mean DUMPED to the dirt&gt;
screaming zonker yellow Ghia coupe with a huge
engine).
