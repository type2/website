Hi Mike,
We guess it depends on how much time you have between getting your bus there 
and painting time.  If you drive it you really will need to rinse it down, 
wipe it and dry it.  Either way you will have to let the metal of body 
equalize in temperature to the inside of the shop or you will be painting 
over a layer of water condensated out of the air itself.
  Hmm, how about renting a large moving truck and that way your bus can 
travel in style inside all the way!
