&gt; a couple months ago I had problem with my 1600 air cooled engine which

&gt; something wrong inside engine.

&gt; 3. End float of crankshaft is 1.2 mm ( too big and I will re set up by shim

This is your problem. The #1 main bearing has come loose and is 
working back and forth on its saddle. This CANNOT be fixed by 
shimming. If you are LUCKY, it may be possible to align bore the case 
and cut the thrust surface for undersized thrust width main bearings, 
but if the bearing acrually has 1mm+ of end play then it is beyond 
saving and you will need a new case.

Sorry.
