Basically figure for the wood flooring to go:
Length = from just behind the front seat bulkhead to as far back as possible 
Width = from the edge which runs along the far wall (opposite of the cargo
doors) to the edge of the aluminum trim strip that runs parallel to the
cargo doors. Dry fit the aluminum strip prior to the wood. See the distance
that is inside the alum strip for the thickness. Remember that this
thickness is to include the thickness of the vynil flooring and the tile
glue compound...
Having fun with this element includes the concept of not scratching your
newly applied paint! &lt;Oh goody!&gt;

Remember to provide holes which will give access to the Zbed securing floor
mounting &quot;T&quot; bolts. It's time to decide whether to weld up the icebox drain
hole or drill this hole into the wood flooring.

The '63 rat EZ camper's interior camping kit currently consists of a big
piece of dumpster dive male cat marked used carpeting. It was so much easier
to install... You can haul parts to Pomona, sleep any angle that you want
and the cat stench provides a natural security system. =)
