I recently purchased a 67 Westy on which a tree had fallen.  It caved in the
top on the front passenger side.  What is my best bet for finding a donor to
go on this otherwise good bus?  I'd like to find a junker shell with a Westy
top but will consider any top that will fit.  What years will fit?  I know
this is not your typical interchangeable part, and replacing such a big
piece on a unibody will be no small task.  Any suggestions welcome.
Thanks,
Mike
