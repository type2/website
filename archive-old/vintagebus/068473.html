Subject: Re: [VB] 57 brake question

you need different spindles as well as the parts you mentioned.

either spindles from a one ton 63 which fit your beam, 
or a whole 64-67 beam.

yes teh earlier cylinders are only available German and cost about twice as 
much as the laters.

&lt;&lt; I have a '57 that's in need of some new front brake cylinders, but
 they seem to be next to impossible to find and when I have found some
 they're $$$'s. Anyhoo, whats involved if I wanted to upgrade to later
 brakes, 62-67 I think?
 
 I'm thinking cylinders, shoes, drums?, backing plates? &gt;&gt;
