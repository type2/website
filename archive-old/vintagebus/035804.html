It is some sort of plastic rubber stuff, dissolves with carb spray, but I was 
chipping it off mostly.  I had already chipped of the carb (melted carb no 
good).   I cleaned one half of the case, but the other half, I think  will 
try that rubbing alcolhol cant hurt.

&gt;The pita is getting the melted stuff off the top of the case.

If the melted stuff is plastic or rubber, you might try dumping some
ice cubes on it and letting them sit for awhile.  This may harden
it enough that you can chip it off with a knife or scraper.  For
more cooling, you can use &quot;freeze spray&quot; from an electronics store
or even a CO2 fire extinguisher, but these will create a large
temperature difference that may not be good for the case (crack...)

You might also try some rubbing alcohol...it eats some kinds of
plastic and if the melted stuff is one of those kinds of plastic
you're set.

Good luck!
