Subject: Re:  KCW DC progress and more questions

Wanted to say how beautiful that yellow bus is.  I love all the chrome.  I am
like a ferret or something .. attracted to shiny things.

1)  Wondering how much money it costs to chrome plate something, like that
bumper for example.  Anyway .. it is fantastic looking.

2)  Jumping from one subject to another ...  Is there anyway to find where
your bus has been ?? I mean, like a pedigree .. names of owners are not
important .. just wondering if you bought it in Florida and it is 36 years old
.. where has the bus been ... where did it's first owner live ?  How long
people owned it before passing it on ??

3)  Totally different subject ... Daily driver .. I think there is nothing
strange about using your 36 year old car as a daily driver.  Yes there will be
mechanical problems, but isn't that the case with any car ?? And repairs
should be WAY less money than on the newer cars.
