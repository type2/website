Subject: Rough Cold Idle

Alright, I've been struggling with this problem ever since I put my engine
back in when I replaced my fuel tank. Engine stats:

1600 sp w/ Alternator
New plugs, wires, cap &amp; rotor
009 dist w/ new Compufire
New 12V Blue coil
New Fuel pump

When my engine is cold (sitting over night) or slightly warm (sitting for
about 10 minutes after I just turned it off) it cranks right up but idles
very very rough with black smoke coming out of the tailpipe. Here's what
I've tried that hasn't worked:

1. Tried both the original 28Pict1 (122 main, 125 Air-correction, 55 idle
solenoid) and a rebuilt 30pict1 (127.5 main, 127 Air-correction, 55 idle
solenoid)
2. Adjusted the automatic choke to varying degrees of &quot;on&quot; when cold
3. Another 009 with points
4. Adjusted the idle-air screws on both carbs many many times
5. I don't think my heat riser is blocked.

If I can get through the rough idle and the engine gets warm it runs and
idles great. It is very inconsistent though, sometimes it will be rough for
30 seconds and be fine and sometimes it will just want to die for 5 minutes.
I think it is definitely a fuel related issue. Anyone have any ideas?
