&gt; Once again you have come to my rescue - this was indeed the problem.  Never
&gt; even noticed that adjustment before!  Adjusted it and it feels so much nicer

Hi Paul,
Clara had the same problem!  Time you got a copy of the bus owners manual to 
study up on.

&gt; Well as I have ordered the new padding I might as well do it now anyway.

Good!
