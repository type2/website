&gt; 
&gt;  &gt;Would someone tell me how to tell which tranny i have in my 66 13 window,
&gt;  &gt;the numbers on the front of the case are 113 310 171,it takes a 6 volt 
fly ,
&gt; 
&gt;  &gt; i would try to research it but im all greasy, im sure you guys know.
&gt;  

the serial number is on the front of the tranny case, not the nose cone, and 
starts with a letter.  You might have to clean gurk to find it.  The number 
you wrote is a part number, says it's on a part of a tranny, but you already 
knew that.

but unless you know the tranny has never been changed, you have no guarantee 
it is the original gearing.  Think a 66 would have come with a 4.375 R&amp;P with 
the big nut boxes when it was new.  but... to find out what you have in their 
I am not sure.  Stephen G posted a thing with jack the bus up and turn the 
motor and count revolutions of wheel system a month or two ago- anyone 
remember how to do that or find it?
