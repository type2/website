Umm, the switch is purely mechanical and can not conduct electricity
without being physically operated.  The odds are very good that the
switch is fine.  What's probably been toasted is the flasher unit
behind the front kick panel.  The brakes and turn signals both go
through it (since the same bulb is used for both).  However, before
getting too excited, make sure you didn't just pop a fuse.
