&lt;&lt;  that glass cost me $25 or $30, why don't they do bus windsheilds?   
 I'd love a couple clear new  windsheilds the proper thickness with logos 
like 
 that on them.   Or original sigla logos, or rather Delog would be right for 
 my westy I believe.    but no luck.
  &gt;&gt;
I got a set of corner windows for my bus that are brand spankin new with  the 
audi logo beside the vw logo. beneath them it says blindex, beneath that it 
says transparencia 75% a 95%
BR (inside a little box)
INDUSTRIA BRASILEIRA

would these be newer made replacement glass or maybe for the brazilian 
hybrids?
