&gt;Putting the engine on a dyno is only going to tell you if you have
&gt;more power at WOT, which really won't tell you much either.

Maybe I don't understand how an engine dyno works, but I thought you
can use it to tell you how much horsepower and torque an engine is
developing at any given RPM.  I know people are generally most
interested in just the peak numbers, but sometimes the shape of the
curve is important too... a naturally aspirated V-8 making 200 HP will
behave a little differently than a turbocharged I-4 also making 200 HP.

&gt;Run a constant long stretch of road that can be repeated for all tests
&gt;with consistancy. A 100 mile stretch of highway that you can go back
&gt;and forth on, and fill up at the same gas station to check mileage
&gt;differences.

Or a chassis dyno...right, everyone has one of those in their garage.
:)  Although I do think that with reasonable thought about safety, it
might be possible to rig up a fuel measuring system similar to the one
with the glass globes in the Bentley: 50 cc and 100 cc volumes that
can be timed with a stopwatch as the engine uses the fuel.  No, I am
not actually proposing that you use glass in the fuel system of a
40-year-old car bouncing down the road.  Don't try this at home.
