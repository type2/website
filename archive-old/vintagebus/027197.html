Subject: [Fwd: Re: [VB] starting engine out of vehicle]

Forgot to make this public post...

&gt;              I've heard various suggestions of attaching the bell housing from an
&gt; old transmission, and using that, but it's not real clear to me how you do that
&gt; without having the entire transmission housing hanging out there, or doing an awful
&gt; lot of cutting through thick metal.

The other obvious option is to find a junk trans out of a type4 ( 72-
air vanagon)  bay bus, which has the transmission with the bell housing
that bolts off. Nocutting necessary. And an upright engine will bolt
right to this bellhousing portion.

But really, all you need is the half of the trans that the starter bolts
up to. The cutting is easy.  Remember, this is the same transmission
case that is so often sawed in half by errant acccelerator cables.
