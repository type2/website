Subject: Dual circuit upgrade

With all this talk of upgrading to a dual circuit MC it got me thinking =
about a couple things.  Back in my 914 days the hot upgrade was to go =
from the 914 MC to an early 911 MC.  Identical except the bore of the =
911 MC was larger.  I think it was a change from 17mm to 19mm, 19mm to =
21mm, or something like that.  Does anyone know what the bore size is on =
the single vs. dual MC's?  If the bore size is smaller (I doubt it) it =
may not be the &quot;upgrade&quot; it is touted to be.  Has anyone tried the 914 =
or early 911 MC in a bus?
