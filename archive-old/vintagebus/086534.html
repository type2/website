&gt; I'm swallowing my pride and asking an electronics question.

You've come to the right place!  We can help remove your shorts.

&gt; When I bought my 67 bus, the blinkers worked and the wipers worked
&gt; on two speeds.   I had to disconnect the dash for painting, and no
&gt; matter how many times I've compared the wires to the schematic in
&gt; Type2_dot_com's archives, I can't find anything out of place.

A lot of electrical devices in a Bus ground through their mounting
screws.  With a fresh coat of paint, it's possible that many things
aren't making very good contact.  A general thing you can try is to make
sure there's a small bare spot on the body where electrical things are
mounted to it.

&gt; The wipers now run on one speed and the blinkers/flasher will not work.

Does your Bus have the original 9-prong box, or some other replacement
flasher?  You might read the &quot;Troubleshooting&quot; section of my 9-prong box
article at http://www.type2_dot_com/library/electris/vw-9prong.html .  Most
of the directions will apply even if you don't have a 9-prong box; you'll
just need to refer to a wiring diagram to know that the &quot;wire connected
to terminal 30&quot; is &quot;the red wire&quot;.  Or, the below is an excerpt from a
revised version of that article.

You will either need a jumper wire (a short piece of wire, 12 to 16 gauge
(2.5 to 1.0 mm2), with alligator clips on each end), or a friend. You will
also need a test light.

Step 1. Inspection.

Sometimes it's as simple as a wire having fallen off. Take out the front
trim panels (around the headlight buckets) to expose the 9-prong box,
and check for loose wires near the box. Also, check that the wires are
plugged onto their proper terminals, per the wiring diagram. Check the
hazard flasher switch for loose and incorrectly connected wires, too.

If all is well, proceed to step 2.

If one or more wires are disconnected or on the wrong terminals, move
them to their correct terminals and retest according to the table above.

If one of the prongs of the box is broken off, it may or may not have
left a stub. If there isn't a stub left, you may be able to expose some
metal by peeling back the paper label.  Try carefully holding the loose
wire against the stub of the terminal while you (or a friend) try the
turn signals and hazard lights again, according to the table above.

If holding the loose wire against the stub doesn't help, proceed to
step 2.

If holding the loose wire against the stub restores correct operation, it
is sometimes possible to solder a short (3&quot;/8 cm) 14 gauge (1.5 mm2 jumper
wire onto the stub with a HOT (100 watt or more) soldering iron. Crimp a
male terminal on the other end of the jumper wire, and plug the original
wire onto the male terminal. Retest according to the table above.


Step 2. Test light confidence check.

Connect one end of your test light to a bare spot on the body sheet metal,
or on something metal that's bolted to the body. I like to use the end
of one of the mounting studs for the passenger side grab handle. Touch
the other end of your test light to either end of the right-most fuse
in the fuse panel.

If your test light lights, proceed to step 3.

If your test light does not light, either your test light is broken or
the VW you're working on has a very basic electrical problem, like a
dead battery, loose battery cable, or broken main wiring harness. When
you've found the trouble, proceed to step 3.


Step 3. Jumper wire confidence check.

Connect one end of your test light to a bare spot on the body sheet metal,
or on something metal that's bolted to the body. Touch the other end of
your test light to one end of the jumper wire, and touch the other end
of the jumper wire to either end of the right-most fuse in the fuse panel.

If your test light lights, proceed to step 4.

If your test light does not light, either your test light just burned out,
or the jumper wire is broken. When you've found the trouble, proceed to
step 4.


Step 4. Battery power check.

Connect one end of your test light to a bare spot on the body sheet
metal, or on something metal that's bolted to the body. With the key off,
touch the other end of your test light to terminal 30 at the 9 prong box.

If your test light lights, proceed to step 5.

If your test light does not light, either the rightmost fuse is open,
or there is a problem in the red wire from the fuse box to terminal
30. When you've found the trouble, proceed to step 5.


Step 5. Ignition power check.

Connect one end of your test light to a bare spot on the body sheet metal,
or on something metal that's bolted to the body. Touch the other end of
your test light to terminal 15 at the 9 prong box and turn the ignition
key on.

If your test light lights, turn the ignition key off and proceed to
step 6.

If your test light does not light, either one of the fuses is blown,
or there is a problem in your ignition switch.  Turn the ignition key
off. When you've found the trouble, proceed to step 6.


Step 6. Ground check.

Connect one end of your test light to either end of the rightmost fuse
in the fuse box. If your 9-prong box has a metal housing, touch the other
end of your test light to the metal housing. If it has a plastic housing,
touch the other end of your test light to the box mounting screw.

If your test light lights, proceed to step 7.

If your test light does not light, the 9 prong box is not grounded
properly. Some metal-housing boxes ground through a mounting clip to the
body; other boxes ground through their mounting screw; still other boxes
have a separate ground wire. When you've found the trouble, proceed to
step 7.


Step 7. Left front turn signal lamp.

With the key off and turn signal and hazard flashers off, pull the wire
off terminal VL on the 9 prong box and either touch it to the wire on
terminal 30 (with your friend watching the light) or use the jumper wire
to make the connection so you can go outside and look.

If the left front light lights up when you do this, remove the jumper
wire, put the VL wire back on its terminal, and proceed to Step 8.

If the left front light doesn't light up when you do this, there is a
problem with the left front lamp, left front lamp socket, or the wire
from the 9 prong box to the left front lamp socket. When you've found
the trouble, put the VL wire back on its terminal and proceed to Step 8.


Step 8. Right front turn signal lamp.

With the key off and turn signal and hazard flashers off, pull the wire
off terminal VR on the 9 prong box and either touch it to the wire on
terminal 30 (with your friend watching the light) or use the jumper wire
to make the connection so you can go outside and look.

If the right front light lights up when you do this, remove the jumper
wire, put the VR wire back on its terminal, and proceed to Step 9.

If the right front light doesn't light up when you do this, there is a
problem with the right front lamp, right front lamp socket, or the wire
from the 9 prong box to the right front lamp socket. When you've found
the trouble, put the VR wire back on its terminal and proceed to Step 9.


Step 9. Right and left rear brake/turn lamps.

With the key off and turn signals and hazard flashers off, pull off the
wire connected to terminal 54f and touch it (or use the jumper wire to
make the connection) to terminal 30.

If both rear lights come on, proceed to step 10.

If only one rear light comes on, there is a problem with the lamp,
socket, or wire from the socket to the turn signal switch for the side
that isn't on, or a problem in the turn signal switch itself. When you've
found the trouble, proceed to step 10.

If neither rear light comes on, there is a problem with both lamps,
sockets, and wire from each socket to the turn signal switch (engine
fire?), OR there is a problem in the wire from 54f to the turn signal
switch, OR a problem in the turn signal switch itself. When you've found
the trouble, proceed to step 10.


Step 10. Turn signal switch, part 1.

With the key off, turn signals off, hazard flashers off, and the wire from
terminal 54f still touching terminal 30, flip the turn signal switch into
&quot;left turn&quot;. The left rear light should go out but the right one should
stay on.

If this is as expected, proceed to step 11.

If this is not as expected, there is a problem in the turn signal
switch. When you've found the trouble, proceed to step 11.


Step 11. Turn signal switch, part 2.

With the key off, turn signals off, hazard flashers off, and the wire from
terminal 54f still touching terminal 30, flip the turn signal switch into
&quot;right turn&quot;. The right rear light should go out but the left one should
stay on.

If this is as expected, proceed to step 12.

If this is not as expected, there is a problem in the turn signal
switch. When you've found the trouble, put the 54f wire back on its
terminal and proceed to step 12.


Step 12. Turn signal switch, part 3.

With the key off, turn signals off, and hazard flashers off, pull off the
wire connected to terminal 49a and touch it (or use the jumper wire to
make the connection) to terminal 30.  Flip the turn signal switch into
&quot;left turn&quot;. Both the front and rear left turn signal lamps should come
on steadily.

If this is as expected, proceed to step 13.

If this is not as expected, the trouble is in the wire from the 9 prong
box to the turn signal switch, or in the turn signal switch itself. When
you've found the trouble, proceed to step 13.


Step 13. Turn signal switch, part 4.

With the key off, turn signals off, hazard flashers off, and the wire
from 49a still touching terminal 30, flip the turn signal switch into
&quot;right turn&quot;. Both the front and rear right turn signal lamps should
come on steadily.

If this is as expected, put the 49a wire back on its terminal, and
proceed to step 14.

If this is not as expected, the trouble is in the wire from the 9 prong
box to the turn signal switch, or in the turn signal switch itself. When
you've found the trouble, put the 49a wire back on its terminal, and
proceed to step 14.


Step 14. Arrow light in speedometer.

With the key off, turn signals off, and hazard flashers off, pull of the
wire connected to terminal KBL. Connect that wire to a bare spot on the
body sheet metal, or on something metal that's bolted to the body. Turn
the ignition on.

If the arrow light comes on, proceed to step 15.

If the arrow light does not come on, the lamp is burned out, or there
is a problem in the speedometer wiring or with the KBL wire. When you've
found the trouble, proceed to step 15.


Step 15. Hazard flasher switch.

With the key off, turn signals off, and hazard flashers off, pull of the
wire connected to terminal -S. Touch that wire to the wire from terminal
KBL (both wires disconnected from the 9 prong box). Turn the key on,
then pull out the hazard flasher switch.

If the arrow light comes on, turn the ignition off, push in the hazard
flasher switch, put the KBL and -S wires back on their terminals, and
proceed to step 16.

If the arrow light does not come on, there is a problem in the -S wire,
with the grounding of the hazard flasher switch, or in the hazard flasher
switch itself. When you've found the trouble, put the KBL and -S wires
back on their terminals, and proceed to step 16.


Step 16. Warning light in hazard flasher switch

With the key off, turn signals off, and hazard flashers off, pull off
the wire on terminal &quot;K&quot; on the hazard switch. Run your jumper wire from
&quot;K&quot; on the hazard switch to &quot;30&quot; on the 9-prong box. Pull out the
hazard switch.

If the warning light in the hazard flasher switch comes on, push in
the hazard switch, remove the jumper wire, put the K wire back on its
terminal, and go to Step 17.

If the warning light in the hazard flasher switch does not comes on, the
trouble is with the lamp, the grounding of the hazard flasher switch,
or the hazard flasher switch itself.  When you've found the trouble,
put the K wire back on its terminal, and go to Step 17.


Step 17. Conclusion.

If you've gotten to this point and the system is still not operating
correctly, the chances are good that your 9-prong box is broken.
---

&gt; I have a volt/ohm meter and know how to use it, so please tell me what
&gt; I may be missing.

The procedure above calls for a test light, partly because it's cheaper
and partly because it won't lie to you like a meter will.  A meter, by
design, draws very little power (something less than one-thousandth of a
watt) from the circuit it is measuring.  It will tell you that there is
12 V in places that actually have a high resistance path to the battery
positive terminal and won't actually supply 12 V when presented with the
load of a turn signal lamp.  Most test lights don't draw as much current
as a turn signal lamp does, but they draw enough to give you a better
idea of what's going on.

I haven't written a step-by-step troubleshooter for the wipers, but
http://www.type2_dot_com/archive/vintagebus/078359.html describes how the
two-speed self-parking wiper motors are supposed to work, and may be
helpful.  For a quick test:

1.  Disconnect everything at the wiper motor except for the ground wire
     or strap from the motor body to the Bus body.

2.  Take out the rightmost fuse (red) and find out which end does NOT make
     a test light light up or make a meter indicate battery voltage.  Put
     the fuse back in.

3.  Connect a jumper wire from the end of the fuse you found in step 2
     to terminal 53a at the wiper motor.

     This should make the motor run at one speed continously, and it should
     stop in place whenever you remove the jumper wire - it won't park the
     blades.

     If this works, go to step 4.

     If this doesn't happen, the problem is probably in the wiper motor.

4.  Connect a jumper wire from the end of the fuse you found in step 2
     to terminal 53b at the wiper motor.

     This should make the motor run at the other speed continously, and it
     should stop in place whenever you remove the jumper wire - it won't
     park the blades.

     If this doesn't happen, the problem is probably in the wiper motor.

If all of this checks out, the problem is most likely in the switch or
the wires between the switch and the motor.
