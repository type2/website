&gt; &gt;&gt;&quot;TRANSPORTER WORKSHOP MANUAL, 1955-1967 Reprint of
&gt; early 
&gt; English
&gt; &gt;publication&quot;
&gt; 

I got a look at one of these w/o publishing date etc.
at a bus buddies house today. 
(when we talked on the phone, I was hoping it was a Bentley)
imagine my disappointment...
The book was kind of funny; 
it has rebuild sequence for a split case tranny w/ specs 
and then there has a blurb about the i.r.s. tranny 
tacked on the end of the chapter.
The text is clear but some of the photos are bad.
the cover was faded pink and grey w/ transporter  &quot;blue prints&quot; on it.

keep those calls and letters going to Bentley...
only seven at last count? 
i'm sure more by now...

thanks for the work so far 
Thom, ronnie, and all.

Aloha
