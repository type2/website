watch it for a few days.
It --ate-- the fat/meat. big hunks missing, and he says it'll do that to your 
gut too. Don't know that it left to much of an impression about pop, still 
drink lots of it now, although I haven't eatin meat in years.

I have heard that line so often it drives me crazy 8-) If it takes a couple of days to
dissolve it there is very little risk to your guts. You can digest several pounds of 
meat and fat in that time. If anything it dilutes the acid in your belly and makes it
less effective.
If anyone come to the Omaha Show and Shine on July 15th at Flashbacks we can do a test.
