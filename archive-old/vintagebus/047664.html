was writ:


How common is or how many were made of the single cab ute's with no air vents 
on the side of the vehicle. The over head peak on the cab is alot longer to 
channel the air to the motor.

1.   whatsa &quot;ute?&quot;    

2. the overhead lip on the cab is passenger ventilation, not motor.

3.  single cabs have engine vents to let the air in for the motor.
