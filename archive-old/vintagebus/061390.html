Subject: Re: [VB] middle seat seatbelts

Jason, i have a '67 too &amp; the seatbelts do stick back
a little ways but not enough to cause anyone getting
into back seat any problems.  I think the reason they
didn't mount them to the seat frame is because it
wouldn't be safe, the clamps that hold the seat down
would just rip out in an accident.  If they are bolted
to the floor it sould have a harder time.  

Just my thoughts on the subject.

&gt; Or, has anyone mounted seatbelts (customly) to the
&gt; framework of the middles seat? Like, to the rear leg
&gt; of the seat?
&gt; That way you could turn the middle seat around
&gt; backwards (conference style) and people could still
&gt; use the belts.
