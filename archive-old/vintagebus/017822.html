I've never tried this, but maybe it would work:

Get a stiff plastic scraper (if you want to save the
paint under the carpet, metal otherwise) and try that,
also, try it on a hot day when the glue is soft and
get a blow dryer on high and try to soften the glue.
Work your way from edges to the center.
