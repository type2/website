&gt; i was trying to decode my m-codes last night on my 64 kombi and her's
&gt; what i came up with.
&gt;
&gt; saets obviously the popouts and the colors but.but the 531 code is that
&gt; correct?

Yup, that's what 531 is, though of course it might have
been changed since. Mine came with 6 pop-outs, now I
have none :-(

I've been putting together a little Javascript thing to
give M-code descriptions in response to number input,
essentially just the Type2_dot_com resources and the
SSVC/Bullei Kartei/NEATO spec guide lists in a wrapper.
It's not fully complete yet, but a working version is
at http://www.geocities_dot_com/~vwsplitty/mcode.html
