This Bus is a camper with foldout bed, cabinets, walk thru.  Has a 1600 dual
port motor, converted to 12 volt, double bottom floor, vinyl slide back
sunroof( material is shot, water gets in.) The body is in good shape, no
dents, never been hit, has bumpers and spare bumpers. This bus was a 1st
price show winner in the Mannassas Va Bug out about 12 years ago.  It is
located in Williamsburg Virginia. 
With little money and care it can be a show Bus again. The Attached photo is
about 5 years ago. Need any more info let me know. Bob Rodriguez
