Subject: re:My new tires and wheels

It is fairly interesting that you ask about LT and load range &quot;C&quot; tires.
They are not one in the same. They may have been a while ago but not
now. I wasn't able to find any load range C tires that I was interested
in so I chose to look at the weight capabilities and chose an arbitrary
weight of 1500lbs as the weight range I was interested in. These tires
are designed for SUV's and those beheameths weight alot more than my
double cab, even fully loaded. So far the tires are great. They handle
side winds excellent. 30-40 mile an hour winds are not unheard of here
so I get my share of wind testing. I have not had a full load in it yet
so I do not know how they will do there yet. So far I am really happy. I
also have an aftermarket MOMO style steering wheel (this translates to
really small) and the steering effort is not bad at all at low speeds. I
was a little worried about the steering effort of a 205 vs. the 165's
that I had on there before. These again are a hair short compared to
stock but with my freeway flyer big nut tranny and a 1776 with dual
Webers I don't think I would want anything taller. We have alot of head
winds and hills so too tall of gearing would be a pain.
hope this helps,
