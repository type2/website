Subject: Towing vs hauling

As a VW person just getting acquainted with his new bus ('67 Deluxe, VIN 
#257066156) I have been leading a lurker's life.  Since we're far from being 
on the road, I have to drive vicariously, enjoying the ups &amp; downs of everyone 
else on this list.

But the recent threads on hauling &amp; towing made me wonder, if buses are rated 
for such stupendous loads, why is towing verboten?  Seems to me to be the same 
burden, whether pulled or carried.

That's it!  Any ideas?
