Subject: Fw: [VB] Can you tell from the pics?

&gt; &gt; Regretfully I must agree with Jim Ellis. You got about a 71 there.

 Nope- 68-69 sundial camper, cant be a 71, it has wide 5 wheels, cant be 70
 no square marker lights or reflectors. It does have pushbutton door locks
 instead of trigger, it has round reflectors frt and rear. Sundial converted
 kombis to campers, did use 2 pane jalousies windows and did offer a small
 poptop for the bay window. Thats my story and I'm sticking to it. 'sides,
 what does Jim know about a fat chick anyway. =8- )~
