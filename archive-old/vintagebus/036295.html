I drilled out the previously-broken bolt, used a&gt; little penetrant, a little heat and a few choice words, but the rods&gt; won't separate.&gt; &gt; I've also tried twisting with a pair of vise grips, that didn't work out&gt; either.&gt; &gt; I'm considering marking and cutting the rod in two (I need to take out&gt; the beam) then welding it back in again. Will the rod being shortened&gt; the width of the hacksaw blade affect the shifting after it's all welded&gt; back up?&gt; &gt; Just looking for feedback before I perform any half-_at__at_sed repairs on my&gt; bus.&gt; &gt; Everett&gt; '66 Westy&gt;  I've beaten two off so far with a hand sledge.  It goes forward. Not an easy deal, but it works. Also, I replaced one that a previous owner had welded. I guess he drove it that way for a while with no problems. I never drove it after!
 I bought it so I couldn't tell you how it was working at that time.  Hope this helps.Vince59,63 23 window deluxes
