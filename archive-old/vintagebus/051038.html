Subject: RE: [VB] NW VW Shows

There is one in July at Shoreline Community College near Seattle.  I
used to live out there but don't remember the exact date.  I seem to
remember it was in mid-July.  Typically the Saturday was a show/swap
meet at the college and then Sunday was a show and drag races and stuff
at Seattle International Raceway.

Hello,
I am fairly new to this board and I am very interested in where the
annual
VW shows are in Oregon and Washington. If anyone has any info I would be
stoked!

Thanks,
JDK
