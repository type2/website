We're leaving Fresno, the Midwest of California, about 7 a.m. on the 21st if anybody wants to join us down 99, across 58 to 40 to 95.  Robert Davis from Santa Barbara? Craig Sauls from Modesto? Fresno lurkers? 
I'm bringing down the fantastically-fun-2-liter-pop-bottle-launcher-with-human-powered-propulsion. Plenty of muddy Colorado River water for throw weight. We tried it once at Jerome, but with the tight space, we freaked out a fellow camper. Who knows what trouble we'll get into this weekend. 
Oh, Dellortos. Karl came by after wrenching on Mer---- Be--'s all day and tweaked the carb and they're purring like siamese twin cats. Last minute wiring and seat belt installation and I'm good to go.
