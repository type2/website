We are going to be having the 100th anniversary celebration on December 2nd,
2006.  This is an all day event from 9:00 AM to 3:00 PM. Please feel free to
contact us at 602-272-5639 and you could ask for Joel Ramirez or David
Walker. The area of location where the vehicles would be set up is pending
at the moment.

 

The main objective is to set up older type vehicles for display remembering
the past years of history.

 

our address is 2300 W. Van Buren St. Phoenix, AZ
