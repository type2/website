Subject: Tires .. it's been a while

So what tires are people putting on 15&quot; rims? I have this rim with an old
firestone tire on it .. it has 'tubeless' in big letters (I suspect it is an
early tubeless tire) and it's really knobby .. really really knobby (is that a
tire term) .. and skinny .. really skinny .. maybe 4 1/2&quot; wide .. it is
perfect for holding up the seat in my 60. The fatter tires I run on my bus
prevent the seat from sitting exactly right so I keep this one .. I'd like to
find a set of tires that match the specs of that old firestone knobby tire
(btw - I'm sure it would be too unsafe to put on the bus). I'm wondering what
is the skinniest LT tire I can get ... for a 15&quot; rim.
