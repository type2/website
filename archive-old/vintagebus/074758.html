Subject: Data plate info

Hi Volks!

I just purchased what is reportedly a 67 camper, and I wanted to confirm the
data plate info.  Unfortunately, I can't remember the website I had used in
the past to do that.  I thought Thom's Vintagebus site had a decoder, but if
it is still there, it is too well hidden for me.

Can anybody tell me (politely!) where to go?

Alternatively, here is the data plate info:

22 5
426 043 080
UY2112 131383 7127223

Gracias,

Dave Gillingham
