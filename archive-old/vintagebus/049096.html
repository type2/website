&lt;&lt; Don't forget the condoms when doing this job.. I know it sounds wierd, but
 if you put a condom over the splines on the axle, it will usually save the
 seal.
  &gt;&gt;
                Is that a leaky axle or are you just happy to see me?

This gets my vote for the &quot;Subject Line of the Year&quot;  award. Definatly a
classic!&gt;&gt;
                       Classic like the original song?

This is your official, engraved invite to join fellow listees for a pint at the brewpub across Katella from OCTO. We'll have a big table and a red toy ambulance to mark our spot, but ask the bartender for your pint. Faster service and he'll keep my tab. Order a root beer if you want, Ronnie. Tell'em Harry sent you. Food's not bad as I remember.
