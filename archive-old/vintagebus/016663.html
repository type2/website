While a really nice un-restored car is cool, it's also a double-edged
sword: it's intrinsic value is in it's un-restoredness.  The applies
even moreto original, ultra-low mileage cars.  If you paid huge $$$
for a 500mile bus, you're kinda screwed - the intrinsic value is
in the &quot;only 500 miles&quot; aspect.  If you drive it, you devalue it.

Oh well.  Someone is putting $19.5k into the bank this week.  I wonder 
about the tax issues of large bus transasctions.  Do you have to
file a schedule D for something like that?  I know that some of the
vendors will only take cash or postal money orders, and certain
ones have you make it out to a 3rd party - trying to stay off someone's
radar screen, I guess...
