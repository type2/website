Ummm, I had a difficult time deciphering your letter.  Couldn't tell what was 
written and what was forwarded but here goes.  

No I don't need a front bumper, mine is intact and has overriders.  I do need 
a rear bumper though, preferably with overiders (they look so cool!)  As far 
as storage space, I don't have any.  My tiny little garage has the 66 stuck 
inside with the ass end hanging out.  The darn thing just needs to be three 
feet longer!  This will change once I get the front windows fixed and the 
seals replaced.  
As for the UPS man, was that in reference to the treasure chest?  I haven't 
even peaked inside yet so I don't know what to expect.  He may not even be 
willing to part with anything but if he decides to clean house I will help 
him offer the parts to the list.  
I am hoping to resurrect the Veedubber in him by getting him to help me out 
with my 66 Resto.  He has since turned to porsche but there was a glint in 
his eye when he saw my bus.  Hopefully, maybe...
