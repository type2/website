&gt; I've been freshening up the DP 1600 that was in the 62 DC this week, and
&gt; have a few questions.
&gt; 
&gt; Can I reuse the old push rods?  They are straight and look fine.

Yes

&gt; Do I use sealant on the oil cooler seals?

No.  Use fresh seals, and be sure that the seats are squeaky clean.
Grunge or scratches here lead to oil leaks.

&gt; Do I need to use the gaskets that originally came under barrels?  I was
&gt; told by the VW flaps to just use RTV.

Permatex 3H is recommended, with or without the gaskets.  make sure that
your deck height is correct if you omit the gaskets.
