Subject: Dual vs single vacuum advance

I'm still going through my 1600DP engine that came with my '65 DC.

It came with an 009 and I went to my FBNRTLVWRPS (friendly but, not really that local, VW repair
shop) to see about getting a vacuum advance dist.

The owner, a great guy named Tim, didn't really know which was better, the single or dual advance. I
know the single advances the timing and the dual advances then retards the timing. My question is,
what are the advantages and/or disadvantages to using the dual advance.

I'm planning on installing a Pertronix ignition in the new dist, does that factor-in to the
equation?
