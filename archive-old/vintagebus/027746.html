that's because it isn't a 15&quot; bus rim.......   it is an early Type 3
rim......  they didn't have the clips or the holes... and used a different
hubcap....

&gt; hey all,
&gt; while getting tires dismounted from rims the other day at the local tire
&gt; place ( I have a friend that works there...its nice!) I noticed that i
&gt; have a 15&quot; bus rim that has no hub cap clips.  Ok, thats not odd ;-) but
&gt; the rim didn't even have holes or anything for the rivet to go in.
&gt; There is nothing.  Hubcap clips were never put in the thing.  Its
&gt; exactly the same as the other 15&quot; bus rims that i have, but no hub cap
&gt; clips.  It does have 3 little dimples that seem like they might hold a
&gt; hub cap on (like the late bay-vanagon rims do) but thats all.  Is this
&gt; an early thing rim or some off the wall bus rim?/  Like I said...its the
&gt; same as my other bus rims....
