Subject: LAST CALL: Pre-Registration For Buses Of The Corn ends
  tomorrow!

Hi Volks,

Just a word to the thrifty bus-pilots out there... if you're planning  
on coming out to BOTC there is still time to pre-register and save a  
few bucks.  But your paypal or postal mail payment has to go out by  
the 30th of June 2006 to qualify for the discount.

WHEN &amp; WHERE:
Buses Of the Corn will be taking place on August 18th-20th, 2006 in  
Brooklin, Ontario, about 40 minutes east of Toronto.

WHAT'S UP?
We'll have plenty of activities to keep you occupied, from Breakfast  
Burritos to a Tie-Dye Workshop, a swap meet, Bocci-Ball competition,  
Frisbee Golf, The corn roast/Potluck dinner and the awesome campfire  
circle.

WHO:
We're expecting something between 50 to 100 buses this year, and the  
more the merrier. Aircooleds, Water-boxers, and Eurovans are all  
welcome! Pop the top in with your westy or tent camp in a Kombi if  
that's what makes you happy.

T-SHIRTS:
T-Shirt details are still to be worked out, and this year's shirt  
will be as good as ever. Stay tuned.

COST: $18 for a 2 night stay, or $12 for a one-night-stand.  That fee  
is per bus, not per person. Bring the whole family and have a great  
time.

FACILITIES:
The campsite is a bit rustic, but we do bring in some additional  
Industrial Grade comfort stations. There are coin-op showers, and you  
must bring your own drinking water. There is *extremely limited*  
electrical service available, it's presently allocated to those with  
medical priorities. Dogs must stay leashed, and no fire-arms or  
fireworks are allowed. Red Cup rules apply...

DETAILS:
There's links to a frappr map and a google earth bookmark on the  
website at www.busesofthecorn_dot_com. You can also find pics from past  
years, and a report on &quot;Operation Yellow Ribbon&quot; from BOTC 2005.

Happy trails,

Greg Potts
