To: thom_at_calweb_dot_com, vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

Just wanted to let you guys know about the cool thing Thom came up with.
Thom Fitzpatrick (list admin I might add!) made this SUPER cool thing on his 
website.
Hes got this gallery where YOU (Yes, YOU) can upload pictures to the web and 
put them in his &quot;gallery&quot;. 

Check out this links.

You can do this by youreself with no help from thom. Thats right, by YOURSELF 
needing no knowlege of computer to get the hang of this thing.

Then you can email youre friends links to the page and have them check out 
youre pictures of youre bus!

Check out the picture of my 57 standard bus I posted on there.

This is just the latest addition to his already INCREDIBLE website.
not to mention the vintage bus REGISTRY!
You guys all need to register youre buses!!!!!
