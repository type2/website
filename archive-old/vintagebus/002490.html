List

While the engine and Trans are out I am pounding out the rear corners in
preparation to welding in the new battery tray.  I find I have identical
indentations on the lower curve of the corners, parallel to the ground. My
first impression was that the rear bumper (not available for fitting) had
been pushed into the corners, but the indentations are so even and almost
equal in size that they seem correct.

Are these indentations correct, or should they be removed?

TIA

Bill
