I've tracked down the previous owners of my 74 Super Beetle and my 71 Westy.
Both missions were extremely rewarding and brought tons of smiles to the
faces of the owners.  The one guy was reduced to tears by the memories of
his Westy.  It meant a lot to him.  That's just one thing to keep in mind  -
tracking down a PO might render you VW-less if they offer you a wealthy sum
for their old ride back.  I'm sure it's happened.
