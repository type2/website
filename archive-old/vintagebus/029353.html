&gt;I am in the process of converting my 1959 back to 6V from a poorly done
12V conversion. Would the Interstate 19L-50 battery be the correct physical
size for a 59?
&gt;
I believe I have an Interstate 19L, it fits the cover and strap perfectly.
 The other one close in size is too tall.

&gt;Also, were there different size battery covers for the 6V batteries? 
&gt;
I've only seen 1 6v size cover.  

One thing that is weird is I have an NOS battery cover that has a hand-written
Bus part #, not sure what is different, it looks the same as others I've
seen.  It was $10 from a reputable source so I don't think the seller was
trying to trick me.

Another weird thing, the battery cover picture in the '54 Owner's Manual
has 3 holes in it, I've never seen one like that but that's artwork so who
knows...

One more thing, the stock battery covers work best with stock-style battery
cables.
