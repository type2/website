Hello all,

Yesterday, I was fortunate enough to attend the Butterfield Park Picnic in 
Corona, what a good showing of busses and bugs there.  For those of you also 
there, I had the beat-down DC in two-tone primer.
So, to the point, I talked with a fellow who told me that another guy who 
typically sells wood slats at the OCTO shows had a DC bed and SC bed that he 
wanted to get rid of.  I do not know any of these people's names, but 
someone here might.  Or, someone may have a bed for my doublecab, which was 
completely cut out by a P.O.

Any assistance or leads are greatly appreciated,

Alex Kuchta
