Subject: Re: [VB] new ebay scam page

I got one of these a couple of months ago and turned it in to Ebay.  They
said that it wasn't theirs and they would never contact you that way.  Just
like a phone call that you didn't make don't answer emails that you didn't
start!!

Subject: [VB] new ebay scam page


&gt; ebay supposedly suspended me, and when i went to the webpage they
&gt; gave me, they began asking for mother's maiden name, SS # etc. do not
&gt; EVEN enter your ebay password... it is a scam that i traced to
&gt; cornell's students :)  looks just like ebay, same as the one reported
&gt; earlier,, but has a dotted quad in the addy, so is easier to spot.
&gt; if an ebay site asks for any info like the above mentioned, BEWARE!!
&gt; it ain't real.
