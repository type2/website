&gt; I personally could give a rat's ass what some new owner thinks about what
&gt; I've done to my bus. If they don't like it they don't have to buy it. It's
&gt; mine right now and IF I choose to Rhino Liner the bed....so be it.
&gt; 

That's what the guy said when he cut the wheel wells and the cab divider
back in '72.  I think Rhino liner would be great on the underside of a
bus...  

Now where in the hell did I put my sawsall???  ;-)
