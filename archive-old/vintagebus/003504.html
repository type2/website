I would probably have owned a split window by now, if I didnt keep tripping
over great bay window deals. I've now owned a 69,70,71,72 &amp;77 and have yet
to pay over $500 bucks for one except for the 71 which I hate to admit was
only 5 years old at the time.
I think thats where I went wrong, I could have bought a split for next to
nothin, but instead went into debt for the 71. Ah wasted youth and
hindsight.
