Subject: Re: [VB] Fire Single

    I drove the SC down to the event site today, dam choke sticks. Started right up after setting a year in my warehouse. Will take a ton of pics 
and get them up tomorrow or is it today for all to see as I am sure a few others will also. Sure get a shitload of looks driving it around.
    Yesterday a new Excursion caught on fire in front of my shop and after I called 911 and helped the lady get her 4 kids out of it I went and 
got the fire truck and drove it over to the where the fire was, the local FD got a real kick out of it as did the little kids who were in the SUV.

&gt;OK, I just search type2_dot_com and got all the witty remarks about the fire 
&gt;Single, etc.
&gt;If anyone replied *directly* to me with some serious help please do so 
&gt;again....
&gt;
&gt;Ronnie, I would buy your Single (as I've stated before) if you'd send me 
&gt;some better pictures that aren't 2 years old taken from 60 feet away....
&gt;I'll take Sean (Gus actually) up on his offer, wire you the money have 
&gt;them drive it back for me...
&gt;
&gt;No need to finish a Bus for Shasta then..
