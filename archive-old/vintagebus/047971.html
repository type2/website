Hi Chris,
Sounds like a bad center pin.  You should check out Thom's web site and the
article he wrote about redoing this.  You will need to buy a reamer to do the
bushings or find a shop in your area to do the job.  Worse comes to worse
replace the steel center pin with a new one and this has taken out about
50-80% of the slop without having to replace the bushings.  This is a good
quick field fix if you do not have the reamer to do the job and/or have to
have the bus running now situation.

 &lt;&lt;Getting those tie rod ends off is going to be interesting! &gt;&gt;
Okay the best way to do this is to have the proper tool to remove these, but
if you do not plan to do this often or you forgot your tool and need a part
out of a junk yard now here is how to remove it with only a wrnch and hammer.
 Remove the cotter pin and loosen the nut on the tie rod end several turns.
Then hit the side of the part that the tie rod end goes through with a hammer
firmly (Do not wail on it at first.) three times.  This will shock the part
to deform slightly momentarily and pop the tie end loose.  You will probably
not notice the tie rod end is loose until you push upward on the tie rod with
your hand.  If it does not loosen increase the hammer blows little by little.
 Do not pound on the tie rod stud/nut to push it up and you can save
perfectly good tie rods and drag links.  Eric&amp;Barb
