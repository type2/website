Subject: Re: [VB] Bus Bumper color

When I painted my bumpers and wheels last year I buffed a good area of paint
(OG paint) with polishing compound to restore the color. Then I went to
Lowes and came home with 5 cans of paint that looked close. then sprayed
each one on the bumper and let dry. The closest to OG was Bisque from
American homes collection. Just a slight bit darker (very slight) and 3
bucks a can. A year + later the wheels and buumpers still look great. 3
bucks vs. 13 bucks......Lowes wins when it takes 5 cans to paint 5 wheels
and 2 bumpers w/ overriders.
