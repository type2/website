Anyone see the new ad for the new honda? Just caugth the tail end of the ad 
but it looks like the honda comes up to a splitty complete with luggage rack 
at a red light smack dab in the middle of the dessert. Great looking bus. The 
honda was that new electric/gas combination. 

Whats the message? Anyone know whose bus that was?
