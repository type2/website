	This sounds like a compleat rebuild to me. If the piston was hammering
on the crank then the case is going to need aline-boring ( sp?) so mite
as well just do the whole thing and have it done with. Oh and I would at
least go with 87mm pistons instead of 85.5s they bolt right in and
increase power, especially in a bus. Good luck and keep us informed.
