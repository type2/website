&lt;&lt; Has any one tried using a industrial vapor barrier applied directly to
 the inside metal? &gt;&gt;
Hi Dave,
The problem with this idea is that you are working with metal instead of
masonary.  Have seen too many times volks that used a plastic undercoating,
only to find out later that once the coating gets chipped or scratched the
rust works under the coating and turns the coating into a moisture retaining
barrier.  The rust wicks the water under the coating like gross veins working
it's damage.  Have though this over and am pondering using some of VWs old
sound deadening materials.  
      In the type 1s of the 1960-70s they installed a tar paper styrofoam tar
paper sandwich type of material and glued down to the floor pan with spots of
roofing tar to deaden out the road noise.  Also in the 1970 VW installed
roofing tar material glued with roofing tar to the center of the door skin to
keep this panel from acting as a speaker and producing noise from vibration.
Since both of these were glued down with roofing tar the steel and paint under
and for a little ways around are in perfect shape even when heavy rust has
attracked the rest of these metal areas.   
     For the bus we might paint the interior sheet metal and use this to glue
roofing tar paper wrapped around 1/2&quot; thick panels of styrofoam shaped for
each of the areas behind each of the interior panels.  Both materials are
availible from hardware stores  Fortunitly we have measurements for doing this
from a VW shop bulliteins manual for insulating the panel bus for industrial
use with just styrofoam.  Also copy the bug tar paper panels for the front bus
doors since they allow water to drain through them like the bug.  Hoping this
fall/winter to start experimenting with this to see if it works well and since
tar repels rust it should prevent rust.
