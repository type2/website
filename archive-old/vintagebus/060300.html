Subject: update re: getting my transmission fixed - finally!

Hmm... ok, well, the tranny works just fine, goes into all the gears and
such but it leaks like a m.f.  Will he need special tools to fix that?  um,
obviously if i could afford a rebuilt tranny this problem would have been
solved long ago.  But it's not an option.  So, I guess I need to tell him
not to mess with the gears and such, just to put in new seals and gaskets?

&gt; &gt; I'm just wondering if anyone has any advice on things the rebuild guy
might
&gt; &gt; need to know, as he's not familiar with old vw's at all.
&gt;
&gt; Hi Diana,
&gt; Uh oh!  First big problem is that your friend has not done any VWs before.
&gt; Every tranny rebuilder we have met whether they were praticing or long
&gt; retired say the same thing &quot;You really need to do at least one tranny
rebuild
&gt; a week to keep up the skill level!&quot;.  Many of the interior tranny parts
were
&gt; modified and a letter suffix added to the nine digit part number to show
the
&gt; change.  VW did not stamp part numbers on many of  the interior parts of
the
&gt; tranny center section so one has to be knowlegable enough to identify by
eye
&gt; which parts will fit with which other modified parts in the tranny or risk
&gt; failure soon after!  On top of this all your friend will have to spend
alot
&gt; of time making special tools to work on the VW tranny center section or
spend
&gt; about $1000.00 in tools if he can find them.
&gt;   Just get the VW bus shop manual for 1963-67 and check out all the
&gt; modifications listed in the tranny section, and that does not cover all
the
&gt; modifications done since the 1960s to the replacement tranny parts!
