Subject: Gas Heater Seminar Location &amp; Date Change

I'm sorry and I hope we haven't created a problem for anyone, but we have
had to move the date of the Gas Heater Seminar back one week to February 25
in order to secure the location that we really wanted.  We also moved the
time up one hour to 1 PM in order to fit all the information in and allow
those that are driving in time to get home at a decent hour.  So here's the
scoop:

Gas Heater Seminar
Date - February 25
Time - 1 PM
Location - 11010 NW Berry, Kansas City MO (about 3 miles south of KCI airport)

Topics to be covered:
***1.  The history of gas heaters
***2.  Types of gas heaters
***3.  Theory of Operation.
***4.  Maintenance, Testing, Repair and Rebuilding
***5.  Purchasing
***6.  Sources for rebuilt heaters, parts and service.

We will have available copies of the repair manuals for the BN2, BN4 and
South Wind heaters.

We will video tape, so videos along with information and manuals will be
availabe after the seminar.
