Hi Steve,

How are you doing?  

I had always thought that 2/3 seats were delivered with walk-thru
buses thus making the 7 seater model.  I had always thought
bench front seats came with bench middles making the 9 seater
and the two were never mixed from the factory (there is no factory
designation for an 8 seater?).  I'd guessed that
any variation on this was done by mixing'n'matching by someone
post factory.

US'ers (who have the opportunity to see many more original
busses than we do) have previously stated that this is BS and
that they have seen bench fronts with 2/3 middles and walk-thrus
with bench middles from the factory....(I think a walk-thru with a 
bench middle makes little functional sense myself........).  

I would also be interested in the definitive answer 8-).....

Hi y'all,

I've picked up a 2/3 middle seat for my '65 bus at the VW Nats in
Sydney, but there are no fastening holes in the middle floor plates for
bolts (only on the outer plates for a full-length seat). I guess this seat
was not meant to be for a '65, or the 2/3rd was never an option for a '65.
I've got some donor plates I can install
so it's not a big problem.

Question is - what models is the 2/3 seat for, and are they any rarer than
the full-length version (I haven't seen many in Oz.). If it was just an
&quot;option&quot; why won't my floor accomodate it?

Cheers,
Steve J.
