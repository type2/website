One of the strangest things I witnessed this weekend had to do with
money, or at least the pereception of it.  At all of the &quot;big time&quot;
vendors, any time a person who appeared to be of Japanese descent 
approached, the vendor pulled out all the stops to kiss the guy's
butt.  Customer service on a level never seen before.  When a plain-
dumpy-white-boy, wanted something, he had to stand around and wait for 
service, which is to be expected.  I don't have anything against
the Japanese, but the change in demeanor was amazing!  You'd a thought
Heinz Nordhoff himself had just strolled up!
