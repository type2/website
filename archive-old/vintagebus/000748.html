&lt;&lt; So is there a different oilbath that uses both/one/neither of these 
hangers,  or did the po bolt a newer bracket into the older truck when 
converting to 1600? To be honest, the circumference of the 'trapezoid' formed 
when the straps are buckled down seems smaller than a 1600 can, but I haven't 
dug out the spare to try it........... &gt;&gt;
Hi Craig,
Do you have a bus shop manual for pre-1968?  If so check out in the first 
volumn the picture in section K-2, on page 11b.  Is you bracket from the 
wheel well to the upper frame simular?  If you are not going to use this type 
of bracket we could use it for a air cleaner we have without bracket!  
Thanks, Eric&amp;Barb
