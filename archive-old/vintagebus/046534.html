If we were 1/2 as organized as the NRA, we'd have autobahns
with a 125MPH speed *minumum*

Thom,

	If the minimum speed was set at 125mph, where would I drive my bus???
Heck, I can barely go HALF that fast. . .   In fact, I'd be down right
scared to go over about 80mph sportin' the stock brakes outstanding
factory aerodynamic qualities and such. ;-)

	It's true about the political leverage a group with that size would
have.  Though I think you would be hard pressed to get most folks with
families (ie -kids) to agree to a a nation without speed limits (of
course this EXCLUDES those from Montana ;-) ).  Have you ever seen whats
left after most autobahn crashes??  The ones I've seen usually end up
with the occupants getting the &quot;sponge and Mason-jar treatment&quot;, if you
know what I mean.

	Just stirin' the pot on a slow Friday. . .
