Subject: re:kadogs

  They do sell (or did anyways) Kadron single port manifolds, I had a set 
way back when but they are long gone now. I dont think anyone (or anyone i 
know anyways) cuts their stock manifold up and mates it with the dp kadron 
manifold. I have run kadrons for years now and like their power and 
simplicity. I have literaly most available carbs in my possesion and the 
kadogs are the ones on the bus now and they came off my vert when I sold 
it..

Hi Karl
How about posting a pic or 2 so those of us that are interested in such a
setup can see how you did it?  I've also got a set of Kadrons that are
'resting' and could be put to use on the doublecab project.
