Hi Volks,
Also check for the front metal fuel line where it goes through the front  
engine tin that the grommet is still there and not allowing the metal line to  
touch the tin.  Wiggle test the line and listen for metal to metal  clink.  If 
the grommet is not there or failed slit 2-3&quot; of fuel line  (preferably German 
fuel line) along its length.  Slip this onto the metal  fuel line, with half 
its length through the tin and hose clamp in  place.
 
&gt;&gt;  Getting the engine running is only the first part of the  fun.  Before 
you drive the Bus, you need to inspect the brakes, suspension,  and steering.  
It is probable that all the rubber hoses in the brake system  will need to be 
replaced.  &lt;&lt;

 
Best to figure that any automobile that has sat for longer than six months  
needs complete brake disassembly and inspection.  Just the water that has  
built up in the cylinders will have rusted them up.  Repack with new  grease, 
front, rear wheel bearings &amp; CVs.  Change  tranny gear oil and inspect the old oil 
for metal flakes as big or bigger than a  pin head.  Have someone wiggle the 
steering wheel while you inspect the  steering underneath for slop.  Build the 
lever tool to check the front ball  joints for wear.
  In other words make sure the steering, brakes and suspension are in  good 
condition before even starting the engine.
  Once that all is good to go.  Work on the engine.  Best  would be to just 
go through it and rebuild it.  That way you will have a  reliable engine.
  If no rebuild, then strip the engine down to a long block and  inspect for 
junk in the head intakes.  Any junk there, then remove heads  and clean 
chambers.  Then retorque ALL engine case and  then head fasteners.  Clean out ALL 
casting flash and  crud out of head and cylinder fins.  Then reassemble the  
engine.
  For the first 300-500 miles drive in town (stop-go) traffic, on  drives 
15-30 minutes with at least 15 minutes between drives.  Change oil  every 50 
miles or sooner when oil on dipstick gets dirty for at least the  first 300 miles. 
 Driving at higher RPMs while the engine is repolishing  all the moving 
surfaces inside (friction = lots of heat) and not changing  oil often will result 
in a clogged oil cooler and possibly oil passages when all  the old sludge/crud 
in the engine avalanches loose.   BTDT!
