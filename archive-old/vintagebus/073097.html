Subject: Cleaning SP heads

I mailed about some modded 1300cc SP heads I was
getting &amp; when I picked up the entire engine that has
them on it last Satuday I've found quite a bit of
corrosion on it.
There's plenty of white gunk inside the ports and also
on the externals of the heads.
How can I clean this off?
How likely is it to have damaged the heads?
I'd like to salvage these ones.
:o)
Cheers &amp; God Bless
