Subject: Judging/ dealer parts

We have had a lot of  discussion on this subject locally and the thing I
tried to pointout is not what serious judging would do to the value of buses
(as though their not getting there already) but what it would do for the
people with the lack of knowledge. I have watched people on the list totally
chastised the idea of concours judging but yet these are the same people
asking all the questions on originality, does this go to my bus, what colors
etc. These people are trying to restore/refresh their bus as close to
original as they can, but they are against Their pears helping them see what
is correct or not. Concours judging is one of the best ways for the layman
and/or professional to see what is considered the proper way to do
something. 

When I started in Porsche's I didn't know jack, I went to shows looked at
ALL the cars from drivers to full concours, I look at the paint, the way
they were painted, the way the door seals where installed, the interior
details, etc. etc.. Now I do the same with BUSES, at Charlie Hammils I
climbed allover his ORIGINAL hatch top Westy, not to be nosey but to see how
the underneath was painted, how the seals were cut and installed, how they
over floor was put in ETC. Now when I go to bus shows I do the same, I
personally am not a Concours guy, you can tell by looking at my 2 done
buses, but if this class of judging does come about, I might do 1 up, just
to see how I would do. I do have a Perfect 59 Single cab that could easily
go concours and being I have 2 other single cabs to drive why not. Don't put
done the perfect bus or those trying to do them, look at them and learn
it'll only help you make your daily driver better.

Remember that the world evolves as do our hobbies, be open minded, expand
your knowable, enjoy your hobby and the people and events that go along with
it, then we can all get along, work together not against each other. If this
concours thing works VW will recognize our hobby and maybe they will set up
getting the vintage program off the ground. They kind of started seeing the
light when they came out with the new beetle and soon the new bus, so they
are aware, now it's up to all of us to prove it.

As for parts, Porsche use to auction off their obsolete parts, That's how
Porsche Parts Obsolete started, they would buy pallets of NOS parts gathered
from the dealers, didn't know what they were going to get in them but the
first load was all 4 Cam Carrea engine parts$$$$. Most VW dealer stocks were
not destroyed, there has been VW fanatics around forever, long before it
became the in thing, these people have be scouring the VW dealers for years,
finding the parts and hoarding them, most of us know who they are. 

   A funny thing though was in Germany there is a VW dealer about every mile
and they still had/have a lot of NOS parts as does the Wolfsburg Museum. I
met some guys at Bad Camberg from Finland, they left Finland without a VW
part and by the time they arrived at Bad Camberg they had boxes full of NOS
parts that they bought from dealers along the way to Germany.
