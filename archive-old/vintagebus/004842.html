&gt; Well it turns out that some of the parts I've ordered from Barrett
&gt; Enterprises are crap.  The reground lifters that are supposed to be
concave
&gt; aren't - they are flat.  The local guru looked at them and said he
wouldn't
&gt; use them.

??  Something is wrong here. New lifters are ground convex so they rotate
when the lobe comes around, otherwise they would wear in one spot. Over time
they wear concave, that is when you huck them along with the worn out cam.
Your guru wants you to use worn lifters??
Take one of your rebuilt lifters and stand it on a piece of glass. It should
rock on the center of the end. Not much but it won't be perfectly flat.
