Hello,

The recent postings on rebuilding redux boxes got
me to thinking about the current prices on the bearings.
I called a local bearing house and gave them the 
numbers for the bearings to see what they wanted for
them.  

I am still in shock.

Granted, its only been about 18 months since I did
a complete rebuild on a redux box but the prices, while
they were retail/ over-the-counter, were enough to cause
me to flinch.  The 6305 bearings were $23 each, the 6306
bearings were $30 each (and you need two per side), and
the N207E roller bearing was $90.  These were either FAG
or SKF brands and I was told that they may have difficulty
in suppling the N207E as FAG may have discontinued it.
Taking off my shoes to use my toes to count I come up
with around $340+ tax for just the bearings.  

Makes you want to run out right now and change the gear
box oil, doesn't it?

PS- I also was told that prices tend to increase 2-3 times
per year.  They never go down, only up.
