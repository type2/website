Subject: ICQ Problem/Question

Hey guys, this is kind of VW related.  Since a lot of us use ICQ or
messenger and talk back and forth off list about different things, I've had
an ICQ problem surface that has never happened before.  What happens is that
when I click on someone's name to send them a message, at the very bottom of
the window that I type my message into, there is a little tip, almost like a
banner ad, that reminds you of various ICQ features and sometimes does
advertise something.  I'e NEVER had this pop up before and it just started.
I have ICQ 2000a and I didn't install any updates or anything and haven't
for the past few months.  I've looked in the configuration and cannot for
the life of me figure what prompted ICQ to all of sudden start doing this.
Any suggestions?  Thanks!

NQ
