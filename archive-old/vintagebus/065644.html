&gt; Hey all,
&gt;
&gt;         I'm working on the bus and I found out some wacky stuff!
&gt;
&gt;         The front end has different year spindles!!  The bus is a '60 and the the
&gt; drivers side somehow has a later ('64-67) spindle/brake set up?
&gt;
&gt;         Is this possible?
&gt;         Am I dreaming?
&gt;         Any reccomendation?
&gt;         Should I upgrade the passenger side?
&gt;         Should I downgrade the wacked side?

If this is true, then you have a &quot;stock&quot; '60 spindle on one side, and a &quot;63&quot; spindle
on the other. The &quot;63&quot; spindle uses the earlier link pins, but the later brakes.

I use these alot on the early Buses I do. Better / cheaper brakes that way.

If you can find another '63 spindle and upgrade the brakes on that side as well.
Wolfgangs would be a good source for them.
