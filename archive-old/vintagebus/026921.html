Subject: clutch pedal working :-)

Well, it turned out the problem was at the pedal, so I pulled it all apart, sanded
it, greased it &amp; put it back together.  It was so stuck that it would barely
move when I pulled on it.  took much prying with the big screwdriver and hammer
to get the *&amp;*^* thing out too.  Of course I touched the horn wire in the process
and it broke right off.  Oh well, new wire, works good.

Thanks to everyone who replied, esp. Eric's tip about using vise grips to clamp
the cable so I wouldn't have to mess with the tranny end of it.  Easy as pie.
 Happy bus.
