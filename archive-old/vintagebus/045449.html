i don't know exactly what it looks like, but I saw a 50's westy that was made
so it could fit in a barndoor- it had the cutout for the long grab bar on the
back of the partition.    Also had  a red/white striped tent, and the back of
the front seat swunng up as a kiddie cot.  Really neat bus- wish I knew where
they were- I would like to have a westy kit for my 53, then I could camp in it
comfortably.    I saw picture of how they just put the kit in over the panels
in a standard, even.   But I am just waiting, not holding my breath.
