Subject: [VB]  1700 lb Kennedy Pressure plate (in)compatability ?

Hi  I've having problems with a Kennedy 1700 lb pressure plate,
engaging/disingaging the clutch in the '63 Bus. Ajusted 3/4&quot; play clutch
,pedal pushed all the way in, would not release. Kept tighten cable so
clutch would work then slipping clutch.    Put in another 1700 lb Kennedy,
stock clutch plate and throwout bearing again today same thing. It's a 67
type trans(stock) from Rancho the only thing different is the clutch arm on
the trans is the later off set type.I'm still using the pressure plate with
the ring, early throwout bearing... It feels like the arm movement is not
enough.  Any ideas before I  replace it with a stock Sachs pressure plate ?
OH it's got a 1776 with 40 IDFs .I have used Kennedys PP before on Bettles
just not on Buses....   Lloyd in Eureka, Ca.
