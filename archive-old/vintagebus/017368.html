A friend of mine has a '59 standard done like that, completely covered
with those carpet sample squares.  It is the *quietest* bus I've
even been in!  It's so quiet it's eery!

&gt; &gt;&gt; wait a few years...)

&gt; I used to have a '73 bus with an interior like this. ceilings? carpet.
&gt; floors? carpet. walls? mostly carpet, plus fake wood paneling! it was
&gt; awesome.
