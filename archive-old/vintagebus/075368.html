&gt; I talked to Rick Long about this and he said this was not the case. He said

&gt; is fine.

I'm not sure who Rick Long is, but I'd say, based on various technical
information passed around on these lists over the years, that he's
entirely wrong.

All of the technical information I've seen shows that some of the
additives to GL5 actually corrode our uncoated brass or bronze.

The archives have plenty of information on this, search'm.  Try google, as
well.
