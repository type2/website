I will need you to send me .843 g.  of the material you state is &quot;paint&quot;
It should be uncontaminated and placed into a vial that has been run
through an autoclave and also cultured for sterility.  Then evacuate as
much of the air content from said vial before packing it in liquid oxygen
and sending it off to me.  You're paying the shipping right?
Within a 2 day to 1 year period, I should have the answer for you.
Your patience will be appreciated.
Thanks and later........
