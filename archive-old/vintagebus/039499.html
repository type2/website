Engine is a 1776. Was originally from a texas Ghia. When the engine was out 
I should have figured out the comp ratio. I didnt. I did pull one head off 
to make sure it was a 1776 and not a 1600. I figured that in texas it was 
hot so they would not have a high CR. I am probably wrong. I didnt notice 
any shims on the barrels allthough they may have been there. When I first 
put the engine in, I couldnt get it started, and for the hell of it I tried 
a compression check. Now this is a cold engine, and I got 150 all the way 
round. I know that you cant tell the CR by compression psi, but some web 
sites have said that a 150 psi check would indicate a high CR. Oh Crap. 
Thats what I dont need. It does feel VERY powerfull.

I put a VDO temp guage in to see what was going on with the oil. The guage 
had been used with this engine before. It does not work, not unless my oil 
temp is at 250 when I start it and then work up to 300 on the freeway at 60. 
(I hope not). I made sure everything was hooked up right, and checked the 
wires. Even had a long talk with a good tech at Ovals VW in Federal Way. The 
Sender is not likely the problem, as I can pull the sender wire OFF (at the 
guage) and it doesnt change the reading.

Should I get a new guage? Sure I should but the new vdo guages (mine was 
made in the late 80's) suck. The range is all wrong. It has a very narrow 
range from 180 to 220, and thats the area I want to watch. Stupid Guage, I 
should have gotten one at a swap. Anyone ever fix thier old guage?

On a final note, I drove about 20 minutes at 60 then pulled off the freeway 
for gas. Station was right next to the end of the exit so I hopped out and 
grabbed the dipstick to see if it was hot. I could hold it all day. Not very 
hot at all. I hope this is indictive of the heat in the engine. OTOH it 
wasnt very hot outside, about 65 at most, so my problems may be coming.

Oh my oil filter and pulley (aluminum degree ring) where very hot to touch 
but not scorching.
