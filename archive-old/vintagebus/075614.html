&gt;Funny that y'all should mention tail gaters....  I was just sitting
&gt;here trying to see what would be the best words to put on my slow
&gt;singlecab.

I have a sign in the lower left corner of the rear window that says
&quot;faster traffic keep left&quot;.  There's another in the lower right
corner that says &quot;Vorsprung durch Technik&quot; in a blackletter font.
I have thought of changing it to something like &quot;Vorsprung durch
Luftkuhlung&quot; or similar.

As far as the flame-thrower thing... wow, $200 is a lot for $10 worth
of circuit, plus another $20-$30 for the coil and plug.  You can
probably do it on the cheap with just the coil, plug, and a beefy
switch.  You have to set the carb kinda rich to get this to work,
though... it was probably first made popular when cars still had
manual chokes, so it was easier to richen your mixture on demand.
Don't try this at home.
