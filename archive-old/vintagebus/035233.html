&lt;&lt; Hi ya'll i just got a case and was having a little problem with the number.
 it is #  0442053 
 now thier is the vw stampping and what apears to be a faint H to the far 
left 
 of it.
 the engine # is stamped clearly, now i am unsure if the H is part of the # 
or 
 not.
 as it is not at the same plane or stamping depth.
 also could the zero in the begining of the # be a O?
 i was told it was a 1300 FWIW.
 
 thanks
 joe 
  &gt;&gt;

if it has an H it seems like that started out life as a 1500

if it was a 1300, the number would start with an F (66 bug motor)

look up the number in the back of your idiot book (Muir) for more info
