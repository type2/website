Subject: 40hp into 1500 Bus?
Message-ID: &lt;374AA5E7.22BC_at_piasanet_dot_com&gt;

I have an opportunity to buy a freshly rebuilt 40 hp for a few clams and
I was wondering if it would work ok in a bus designed to run a 1500 ('66
Deluxe with 1.26 reduction boxes). Too underpowered for the gearing?

Also, what is the deal with the rocker studs on those old 1200's. If I
pull the valve covers off, what should I look for?

If it's too much for the bus, I'll probably put it to work in the oval.

Thanks for any feedback.
