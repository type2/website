The description is necessary as I have encountered many of the wrong type, including a very nice gentlemen who contacted the Hella factory in Germany for me.

For anyone who may know someone with a set, I appreciate any help you can provide.  They were most likely used on other mid-50s German vehicles as well.

I have cash to purchase any reasonable set that comes my way.
