&gt; temp??  By the way, it's like 90 degrees in southern ohio today, and boy
&gt; would it be nice to have crank down windows!!!
above re 66 bus.

What would you need those for? I have a 61 and a 71 and the ventilation is
quite comparable.  The main reason people complain about the ventilation
in a splitty is because they are too lazy to fix the vent windows.

The vent windows in a split let in SO much air you need goggles at highway
speed if you angle them right. Square in the face you will get a HUMUNGOUS
blast of air.  If I was driving a splitty/bay where it gets hot, and the
vent windows didn't function that would be the first thing I fixed. to be
fair the Bay vent windows do pretty well also, but not quite as
good.  However, the dash vents are better than the overheaed one in a
split so it all about evens out in the wash.

After having experienced the power of vent windows, I'd never go back.

Take care,

Steve
