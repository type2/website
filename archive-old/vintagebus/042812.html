Re: VW Engine shops in Used Jersey;

 sure...they are around.  I've taken mine to Larry at Classic Motors in
Kingston, NJ.  He did a good job and only charged me a bottle of Scotch. I
like him, and he is very inexpensive, but he works to his own timetable
and you have to deal with that. I went to Hodi (sp?) in Manalapan and his
work convinced me to never let anyone else work on my bus.

  I found out that my Bus was only insured for ACV - $500 deductible
today.  It is smart to look over the insurance papers!!  
Phone Conversation went like this:
I asked &quot;well, if it was totalled, what would it be worth?

[sound of keypad clicking] 

Insurance Agent replies: ACV is $2,400 new in 67' minus 33 years
depreciation minus $500 deductible is AHEM 
[long pause] 
Sir, we would call it a wash and refund your premium.

I answered:  just forget it then, what's the use. I'm protecting everyone
but myself with your insurance and it is worthless.

Insurance Agent: Try American Collectors Insurance, they are what you
need.
