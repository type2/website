Subject: Bus Insurance

Howdy all,

It's insurance renewal time at my house and I was wondering what suggestions
any of y'all may have regarding insurance for my '66 13 window Deluxe.  We
are currently using State farm, but I was wondering if any of you have or
are using one of the vintage car insurers.

Thanks
Gary
