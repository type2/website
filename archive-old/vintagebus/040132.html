well, since these were typically installed by dealers, you'll see them in 
various places. i have seen them under the radio, next to wiper switch and 
next to headlight switch in that same flat 2&quot; ridge at the bottom of the 
dash. i have also seen them up on the curved part of the dash on either side 
of the speedo.
