Thanks Erin,
I did pull out the pushrod tubes, but I think maybe they're a little crooked,
as in not dead center in the holes in the head.  Don't know if that has anything
to do with this or not.  The cylinders seemed to fit pretty snug to me, but
I didn't put any sealant on them.  

The only other thing I can think of is that the old heads all had a circular
shim type thing (like a metal gasket) and the new ones didn't.

I torqued the  heads down like Muir said to.  It didn't seem like very much
pressure, but I guess 23 lbs is what it's supposed to be...

After working on it in the rain all day this sucks.
Oh well, it's supposed to be sunny tomorrow.

&gt;Well hey Diana - sorry to hear about the oil pouring out of the engine.  The

&gt;part about the pushrod tubes leaking...did you &quot;extend&quot; the tubes before
&gt;installing them?  They need to have a certain amount of &quot;crush&quot; when you put

&gt;the heads back on.  If you don't, they never seal quite right.  You fix this

&gt;by pulling the head, removing the tubes, extending them (very carefully!),

&gt;and cleaning the pushrod tube holes liberally (spic and span!!!).  Upon
&gt;reinstallation, use some kind of gasket sealer on the seals and tube ends to

&gt;prevent oil leaks.
&gt;
&gt;As for the oil pouring from the cylinders - just before you install them,
&gt;you should put some RTV around the base of the cylinders and then install
&gt;them.  BUT, before you even do this, you need to make sure that the
&gt;cylinders don't slop around in the case.  If it's been bored out previously,

&gt;there is no way an undersize cylinder is going to seal no matter what
&gt;(besides an obviously creating a gap for oil to shoot from.)  If there is
&gt;ANY slop between the case and the cylinder, they are the wrong size.
