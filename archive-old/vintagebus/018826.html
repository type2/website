Not that hard at all.  The new harnesses come with decent instructions,
and if used in conjunction with a wiring diagram (http://www.vintagebus_dot_com/wiring)
it shouldn't be a problem at all.

&gt; I was wondering how hard is it to put a new  wiring harness in.  How well 
&gt; are the harnesses labled? Do they have very good instructions? To me it 
&gt; looks like it is an issue of taking your time?
