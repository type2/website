couldn't you just use a bucket of water?  hook the sender to guage and 
suitably wire to a battery, and dip bottom of sender into bucket, watch 
guage?

 Is the system still 6 volts?
 Which  gas tank are you using?
 We are using the bay sender and tank . Runs 25 (empty) to 90 (full) ohms ????
 (just can not find our notes) with a  68 bug speedo? with the gauge in the
 speedo ( no holes to cut )
 We did use a 10 watt 10 ohm resistor in series
 This put the gauge within one gallon for the full range
 Hope this helps
 The ground from the sender can be bad but that probably is not your problem,
 sounds like the sender (sorry)
 P &amp; C
 59 DDR w/t w 65 EZ camper and bay gas tank on 12 volts
