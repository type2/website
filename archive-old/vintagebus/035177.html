&gt;        On your sheet metal question, there are three parts to make up the
&gt; area that you need.  First, and obviously, the &quot;outer rocker panel&quot; (app.
&gt; $40).  It has square holes in the middle of it with tangs that stick up and
&gt; go thru the second part, the &quot;outer ten inches of the cargo floor&quot; (app.
&gt; $45).  The floor will have the &quot;check plate&quot; that you are looking for
&gt; prewelded on it.

&gt; All parts prices are quoted via Wolfsburg West, but Das Bulli Haus makes 
&gt; heavier duty sheet metal parts.

I have heard that the cargo floor peices that DBH sells do NOT have the
reinforced strike plate for the cargo door vertical rods nor other seat
mounting plates.  I have heard that WW's floors do have these plates.  Is this
correct?  I got this info from another lister (chunks!), and just want to see
if things have changed :)
