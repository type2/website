Subject: Re: [VB] Toe In.

    The simplest way to compensate for &quot;wheel/tire run out&quot; is to jack the
front wheels up just until they clear the ground. Take a piece of artist
chalk ( because its large and easy to handle, but anything will work even
spray paint ) and make chalk mark all the way around the tires. Then use a
&quot;fixed&quot; scribe ( a nail through a 1x board with the nail pointing up, works
good ) and with out letting your etching tool move, etch the tires in the
middle of the tread all the way around. Let the van down and &quot;bounce&quot; it up
and down to settle the suspension. Then use this mark as your reference
point, you also want to make your measurement at the same height from the
ground on the front and rear of the tires. And your right 1/8 of an inch
positive toe in is right. But before you set the toe, you want to center the
steering wheel, and check tire pressure. First you want to make sure the
steering box is centered. Align the notch in the box with the ring on the
steering shaft to center. Then remove and re-align the steering wheel if
necessary. Once it is aligned you want to tie it off so it does not move
while you adjust the toe.

&gt; How does that play with a rim that is not really straight? Will the tire
&gt; &quot;average&quot; out the wobble? If I spin the wheel, the tire has a little
wobble
&gt; too. Can I use the inside of the brake plate? Or how about removing the
&gt; wheels and measuring off the outside of the drums? In that case, what
&gt; dimension should be used? Its gotta be something less than 1/8&quot;.
