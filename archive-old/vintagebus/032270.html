I have seen Chris' wheels in person and would attest to their quality. They
look like they're NOS! What you might not understand from his brief note is
that these are not repaired wheels...they are completely remolded wheels!
Essentially he breaks them down to the cores and puts them into a mold
which he fills with the correct plastic. Doing a resto on a steering wheel
will look great for awhile, longer if your bus is a garage-kept trailer
queen....but it won't last forever. Well, these probably won't last FOREVER
either, but they'll last a lot longer if you actually use your bus.

With the new price, Chris...I'll probably be ordering at least one soon!

Cheers,

Scott

&gt;Hey Chris. Do you have any pictures of your wheels on the web?
