Subject: Re: [VB] Re: generator issue  6V conversion

Thanks.. I'll pull that 130 air jet out and hope I have a 155, or at least a 
bigger one, to swap in.  The shut off bit I used is a 45... but I also have a 
55... seems that 45 is closer to 47.7 than 55 is, so I'll just leave the 45 
in.   :)   Found my 6V choke elements, sorted!  Worst problem is finding all the 
bits... easier when everything is nice and clean in a pile (sigh)

 I just swapped over to the small heater boxes so they'll line up easily... I 
hate the way they don't fit when they aren't the same size... and I used my 
adaptors on the 61... so I'm just going to run the small ones.

Got the engine with the ground test stuff hooked up.. but the starter just 
clicks... I'll pull the tranny piece/starter off and see if it's the starter 
(just pulled one out of a pile) or what. Pics before it wore a carb:

Still have to do the crank nut install.   Didn't 63 trucks come with crank 
starts?   I think mine has the MX code for that, and seeing as its going back to 
factory specs  :)

&gt;jetting suggestions for a 1600sp with 28 in a bus?  think it has a 122.5
&gt;main, 130 air, and the electric shut off dealie..

Per K-2 12 of the '63-'67 Bentley, the stock jets for a 1500 sp with
28 PICT 1 are 115 main, 145y air, g45 pilot.  Multiplying these by
1584/1493 gives a 122 main, 154 air and 47.7 pilot.  I think the closest
normal values are 122.5, 155, and 50 (or 55).  I have no idea how well
these will work - it's just a suggestion based on displacement.
