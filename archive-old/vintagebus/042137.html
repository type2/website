&gt; well i got the case apart today, it is no good, would need to bored again to

&gt; 
&gt; looking to ronnie to get a new one.
&gt; 
&gt; my original is a 1600 single port, the new ones are dual port, so i believe i
&gt; will need a new carb(the 28 pict won't fit the new manifold)
&gt; 
&gt; My options:
&gt; 30/31 pict electric choke
&gt; 34-pict-3
&gt; or something else?

The 30/31 (from Ronnie) that I put on mine worked perfectly from the first
start.  It comes with an adapter for the dual-port manifold, or you might
be able to scrouge up a 30mm manifold center section.

Do put a _good_ filter between the tank outlet and the pump.  I've found
that the 30/31s aren't tolerant of debris in the fuel.  I had to pull mine
apart and give it a good cleaning to get rid of some fiberous stuff that
was caught in one of the jets after about 4000 miles.
