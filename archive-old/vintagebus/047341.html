 I shall finish my exhaust work and thermostat installation and reinstall
 the engine, and then instead of grinding on the bellhousing with a dremel
 i shall run teh engine until the noise goes away... not the best plan, but
 certainly the easiest, and only the metal that needs be gone will get
 ground away.
 
 Then its on to figuring out the funny noise from the transaxle and putting
 in my new rear shocks... i've been putting that off for a month. 
  &gt;&gt;

why not change the rear shocks while the motor is still out?   just a little 
easier.   Myself I would rather sit in the engine area and replace shocks 
than lie under neath and get grease on my head and dirt in my eyes.    Did 
that sort of thing yesterday  ick
