&lt;&lt; I'm ready to take my bus to him for an engine rebuild.  The problem is my 
front left caliper is seized, and I blew a plug.  Both in the same day!  
He'll rebuild my early 74 1700 cc for $900 (good deal?).  &gt;&gt;
Hi Dustin,
Too good!  The type 4 engine cost about $1,500-2,000 for a quality rebuild.  
So unless he is giving away new, or rebuilt parts.......  You really should 
check on the type2 list (1968-79) for you year of bus for more info.
