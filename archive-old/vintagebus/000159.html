Subject: what should i be paying for a 60 sc??
Message-ID: &lt;0.3d0d653a.253d2efd_at_aol_dot_com&gt;

I have a 60 SC that I am supposedly purchasing in the next week or two.  
Since it has been a few years since owning any splits and having never owned 
a SC, I would like some ballpark figures of what I should be paying for this 
one.

heres the basics...
no engine
cracked windscreen
wrong wheels
two fist size holes on each side in front floor
undercarriage out-riggers perfect
not wrecked
rusted rockers,battery tray, misc, nicks/chips
painted really crappy white/blue
wiring is toasted, and rigged up.
brakes are completly toast

but it is pretty solid, and almost complete
the side gates are excellent, with all latches
passed missouri inspection in fall 96
has both bumpers all lights, visors, mirrors, seats,everything
has a basket case 36 hp that can go with it.
front beam,steering box suspension good.

if anyone has real experience with sc's i will have some pics developed in 
the next couple days and i could send some to you and have you give me a 
ball-park figure.

any help would be appreciated,

have fun,
zac
