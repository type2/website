Subject: Non-sealed-beam 6v headlights?
Message-ID: &lt;Pine.LNX.4.10.10007141834500.25437-100000_at_birdbird&gt;

Hello all!

A friend of mine has a '64 Standard bus (and a '56 Oval) that 
he imported from Germany himself.  Both were originally sold
in Germany, not for export, so they have Euro-spec headlights,
not sealed beams.  He's never converted it from 6 volt.  (He's
a ham, but he just keeps a 12v deep-cycle battery right behind
the passenger seat to run his radios, and puts it on a charger
at home.  :)  )

These headlights are a bulb-and-reflector design, just like the
aero headlights on most newer cars.  The August '63 edition
of the owners manual that came with my '64 shows exactly his
setup in the &quot;how to change your headlight bulbs&quot; section.

The bulb itself has a spherical glass envelope about 2&quot; diameter.
There is a round metal disc for a base, and three terminals on
three sides of a square (like the arrangment on US-spec sealed
beams).

Does anyone have a source for these 6v headlight bulbs?  The
few catalogs I've looked at only seem to carry the US-spec
bulbs.

Thanks!
