Wow!  Lots of interest in this.

Charlie Ford agrees that compiling the names of potential participation for
this would be a good first step.  And I volunteered to be the repository.
The number of responses I get will probably determine some of how this thing
gets planned out.  And of course the route will be based on where we have
willing drivers.

I'm starting to think that rather than a 2-directional competition type
thing that maybe we should have a single 'round-the-country' (continent?)
thing.  Picture a route zig-zagging all over the country(s), covering as
many places as we've got buses!  Pass a camera(s) and log book everytime you
trade off with each driver logging any comments, scenery, restaurants,
roadkill, whatever-tickles-you-fancy in it.  Parts of  the journey might
even be made up of mini caravans and possibly some group-campouts depending
on the number of participants for the various legs.  Then post the whole
shabang on a web page complete with pictures, log book entries,
drivers/passengers/buses that made each leg, etc.  What do you all think of
this?

In the mean time, if you're interested in participating, here's what I need
&gt;from you (mail to ME at mike_gensler_at_udscorp_dot_com, not to the list):

Name:  
Bus type:  
City:  
State:  
Maximum # of ONE-WAY miles you'd be willing to drive (remember, how ever far
you drive, you've got to drive to get back home again):

At this point, this is not a commitment (I know time frames will affect some
folks).  This is just to see if we've got enough interest to make something
work.  After we see how much participation we've got, we'll look at how to
organize it, plan the route, set a starting time, and start signing people
up for the various legs and figure out time frames (I expect that to be the
biggest problem).

Also, please don't feel that I've &quot;taken over&quot; this idea and am railroading
it - this is a democratic thing and any and all ideas and suggestions as to
how this thing should work are welcome.  Lets just try to put together
something that will be fun for all, give some of us a chance to meet other
listees, and most important, get out on the road with our great vehicles.
