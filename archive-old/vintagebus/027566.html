&lt;&lt; I am having a most grievous time getting the ball of the shifter, with its 
pin that keeps on moving out, back into the cup.  Is there some trick to 
this?  I am getting mad. &gt;&gt;
Hi Gene,
If you mean the shift spring keeps pushing the front shift rod and it's 
socket down and out of the way....
You either need a helper to hold the shift rod up in place or wedge something 
on top of the cross brace below the shift rod.  Did this latter solution last 
week after replacing and reaming in new center bushings and it worked well.
