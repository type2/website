I hope you get help    :)

Thanks, I always can use another hand. Do you have an extra extension that I
can borrow? =) A guy named Rusty VanBondo is last in line to ever make fun
of anyone's name. Dr. Freud was stuck in the back on the Z-bed I suppose. I
electra, er elect to be up front by the stiff shift. Oops, I meant to say
&quot;stick&quot;... The bare spring frames of my walk through rat seats tend to make
me kinda anal. My frequent usage of the word &quot;Mother&quot; in heavy Phoenix
traffic has prompted several of my bus acquaintences to wonder of I had a
genuine Oedipus Complex. (see http://idealist_dot_com/children/phallic.html). It
occured from about 1955-62 for me. My fear of interaction originated from
early shift coupler separation anxiety. Maybe it's just MY ego talking but
years of latent interest in group (camping) therapy has taught me that we
are all Bozo's on this bus (list).
I figure that Freud was into VWs as evidenced by the website &quot;Freud as
Collector&quot; (In Japanese and English!)

Enough of this poop.  Gotta get my butt into bed.
We better kill the thread before Thom plays &quot;Alpha Dog&quot; on us...
