Subject: My VW weekend in Kansas City

Wow - what a weekend. For the first time ever, I was able to ride in a bus
(78 Westy) for several hundred miles.  I had done 100 miles in one sitting
in my 71 Westy but this was a big long trip with total reliance upon the bus
for transportation.  It was great!

This whole thing started about 10 days ago with a query to the list for a
good passenger side door for my 66 Deluxe.  Dan Kinsey in KCMO had what I
needed so arrangments were made to go down Saturday, spend the night, and
head home Sunday.  During the planning, Glen Hadley (regular vintagvw
listserv member) had emailed me and said he would be free this weekend so
naturally things were arranged so that we could trek to KC in his Westy.

Dan and Rick Taylor put out an APB amongst the KC crowd that Glen and I were
showing up so in our honor, 4 additional listees/bus nuts showed up at Dan's
house including Pink Newell.  I'm sorry I forgot the other guys names but I
kind of think they aren't on the list.  We all brought some goodies so by
night's end, we had a sampling of potato chips, salsa, tortilla chips and
then a nice compliment of tacos and burritos compliments of Dan and Melina.

Upon our arrival, Dan showed us his recently acquired 67 double door panel
with the prospective T4 engine sitting inside.  The bus is rough but
definitely has potential on top of being just plain awesome.  I've never
seen a double door in real life so this was a real treat.  But what I
thought was a treat was quickly outdone by Dan giving us a ride in his Binz
doublecab with a 1776 powerplant.  Dan and I sat in the front while Glen and
the 3 nameless bus nuts crammed in the back.  Of course, before leaving the
confines of the driveway, we opened the safari's all the way and listened to
the Red Elvises (Dan's theme band.)  What a COOL trip - literally and in
quality as well.  I actually stuck my head out and looked straight down at
the ground while we were cruising with the cold February wind pouring down
our backs and through our hair.  That is a trip that I will absolutely never
forget!  The Binz is kind of Dan's crowing bus piece because it sports an
EMPI tach and steering wheel and is his main VW swapmeet/travel bus.  It's
really a gem - I love the thing...

After supper, we watched an 80's SOTO video and had more fun criticizing the
goons in the video than we did seeing the old buses.  The bikini contests
were pretty decent too - some things never change.

Dan, Melina, and their 3 kids were excellent hosts.  The youngest tyke
surrendered his room to me for the night but I felt right at home being
surrounded by miscellaneous lego bits, toy story figurines, games, and all
kinds of neat kids stuff.  I slept like a baby (although I didn't pee my
pants and wake up every 2 hours hollering for Dan to bring me a bottle of
warm milk.) :-)  Glen and I were treated like kings Sunday morning to
biscuits and gravy.  Oh man, I gained 5 pounds smelling it and packed on 10
more eating it - Dan and Melina just really totally outdid themselves and
I'm so grateful and appreciative of it.  Thanks guys!

I went home a happy camper - we took the purple door for my splitty and in
the process Dan had a middle seat for a baywindow with the 1/3 - 2/3 setup
so I snagged it too so I'll have a middle seat for my bus.  After a thorough
discussion with Dan, I've come to the realization that a bus with far less
rust on it than what mine currently has is in my future.  Dan has some leads
on some good buses and on the way home, I remembered one more that I need to
follow up on.

By noon, Glen and I were on the way home and we were pleasantly surprised to
see white over deep green splitty in Fairview, KS parked just 1/4 block off
highway 36.  It appeared that no one was home and that the bus was pretty
much a rolling/driveable shell.  It was uncertain though whether it was a
restoration or just a driver.  It was definitely a later 60's walkthru with
2 different sized seats in the front.  Later on, I pointed out a junkyard to
Glen which I had spied earlier while making deliveries in northern, KS and
upon closer examination from the highway, it appeared that just maybe there
are some buses in there but it was too far away to tell if they were bays or
splits.

By the days' end, Glen and I had driven from the KCMO area to Beatrice, NE
(where I live) and dropped off the door and seat.  Then we drove to Hamburg,
IA where I picked up my wheels and drove home covering a 2 hour trip in 1 hr
and 30 minutes on 2 lane roads.  Matter of fact, I drove for over 20 miles
before seeing any other vehicle on the road which is typical for this time
of year on a Sunday evening...

So here I sit - tired and typing but glad to have gotten the door and bench
seat, met Dan and his family, and thankful that Glen took his free weekend
and shuttled me around.  Everything was cool...
