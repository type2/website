&gt; Hi Eric and Barb, thanks for the info on the childs cots. I have seen
though
&gt; that on a 71 and 72 westy that we used in europe in the 70's did not use
&gt; telescopic poles, they were square stock and very similar in length if not
&gt; the same. On my 67 westy right now it has the round brackets screwed to
the
&gt; inside and these were what it came with. I have seen the half moon
brackets
&gt; that you spoke of but only on the 68 and later westies.I did own a cot out
&gt; of a 65 westy that I regrettably sold quite a few years ago that had the
&gt; round style brackets screwed in also with round poles.

&gt; 65 or 66 on used stamped half moon shaped brackets with the two round
&gt; poles.
&gt; &gt; 68 on were a U shaped cross section poles.  We are not sure if the
hooked
&gt; &gt; ends at this point got thinner.
&gt; &gt; Somewhere after 68 both U shaped poles where telescopic.  Possibly to
&gt; allow
&gt; &gt; installation in the pre-1968 Westies?   Eric&amp;Barb
