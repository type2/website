Subject: Re: [VB] Interesting reaction at a show today...

People have to remember that for MOST Americans, VWs (old air-cooled
anyway) are still considered &quot;throw away cars&quot;.  These cars were for
their time just above a Yugo of today.  You'd not think twice about
cutting the roof off a Yugo would you??  In the 60's and 70's they were
everywhere and always cheep.  

We who prize &quot;vintage&quot; VWs today seem to forget that there are LOTS of
people who could care less about cutting up a VW.  There's always
another one some where cheep....right???  Some people just don't realize
that air-cooled cars are collector cars and they still see them as
&quot;throw away&quot; type cars.

&gt; Amazing that some people are that far out of touch. Like, if you took a
&gt; bus like that to a show - you'd have to expect to get some flack.
&gt; Wouldn't you? And no, the top was in pretty decent shape, so I think he
&gt; just did that to have fun (which I think was one of his comments to
&gt; someone).a
