Subject: Re: [VB] Pedal pan covers (under pedal cover plate)

Hey All,

This is somewhat on topic and I have indeed checked the archives.  I scored 
a 1970 pedal pan in great shape from my dad and was wondering if it can be 
fabed to work on my 66 splittie.

TIA

&gt;
&gt;Damn!  I've been covertly stashing these away, hoping to retire soon by 
&gt;selling
&gt;them on eb*y.
