Subject: [Fwd: mystery knob]

Could someone help her out via p-mail? I'm stumped.

Hi, Jack;
Continuing to do &quot;restoration&quot; on my '67 Westy/Splitty...(actually 
driveable pending a throttle cable we were hoping a local guy was to
find 
at the Swap last weekend, down your way.) Even the mechanic (my husband) 
can't yet figure out what this silver-tone knob on the left of the
steering 
wheel, on the dash (on ours, next to a &quot;12 volt&quot; sticker) is for!!! It 
pulls out and in and we're at a loss as to what purpose it serves!!!
Could 
you please educate us?!
Thanks!
Truly,
Mari in Shelton, WA
