Zeigler converted panel van with a sliding door. Nice original paint, for the
most part. Has a crease on the slider door that could be worked out with
minimum filler my a skilled bodyman.   Needs some rust repair, but looks
awesome regardless. The interior of the cab looks brand-new. Has rebuilt
transaxle and will soon have new 1600sp and brakes. 53,000km. Has original
