Hey all...
hope this goes through..I'm on the library's computer right now..
anyways.  a bunch have emailed me saying that they'd be at the auburn hills 
show...
what it comes down to is that I'm not comfortable taking my bus to the 
show..so I'll be riding with someone else.  I'll be camping at Pontiac Lakes 
campground with the rest of the DBG...

The rest of the days I should be sporting my AIRS sweatshirt...
so if any of you see me there.._dot_come say &quot;HI!&quot;

This means you Steve D.  ... Chris H. ;-)

Well..
hope to see you there!

Isaiah
