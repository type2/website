rpm. I thought was due to 009 but as bad if not worse with vac advance dizzy. 
Rebuilt carb made it worse yet and today at idle, parked, when I stomp the 
gas is the thing nearly dies. I have to pump the petal to keep it running. Is 
fine at higher rpm. Ran great
 in this 60 degree weather going down hill!  :-(   &gt;&gt;

Hi Ric,
Did you remove the accelerator nozzle tube and flush it clean in the reverse
