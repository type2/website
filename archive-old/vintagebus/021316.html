Hello All, 

      Well here's where I'm at. I have 19 days left until my maiden
voyage of 507 miles round trip to BNNTA. This is my first trip of any
length in my bus, and I'm a little nervous. So far here is a list of
things done in the last couple months to get ready.

1. New exhaust
2. New tires and shocks
3. New master cyl, brake lines and rear pads
4. New axle boots
5.Tranny flush
6.New plugs and wires
7.New battery
8.New (used) gas tank
9.Adj. valves
10. Greased undercarriage
11. Changed oil
12.New fuel filter
13.New air filter
14. Lights working except hazard and domes.

O.K. thats the list. I've got a 73 or 74 bug motor and have no clue how
many miles are on it. The speedo isn't working, so no odometer. It
starts with no problem. It doesn't make any funny sounds or leak or
shake like the bejesus. It seems to have good get up and go and the
tranny doesn't sound like an accident waitin to happen. Now here is MY
problem. This bus had been sitting for a few years and I'm scared as
hell about the upcoming trip. Nothing at all seems to be wrong. That's
what freaks me out. I've got a long trip and it would break my heart and
credit card if I broke down. Does anyone have any advice as to what I
may be missing or over looked?  I just don't want to miss the event, or
drive my chevy! I've been told by friends to stop,  that I'm worrying
for no reason that everything seems fine. But they have never owned a VW
before. Any and all words of wisdom would be great! Thanks.
