The vented caps are hard to find, but they're out there.  I bought one of 
some auction site for about $10; try Wolfsburg West or Type2parts_dot_com

Failing that, if you end up buying a non-vented gas cap, you can drill a
teeny hole in it, I did mine dead center in the cap.  I don't remember what 
size drill bit I used, but it was XX/64 - the hole is tiny.

Failure to use a vented gas cap will result in you driving a couple miles, the
the engine will stall for no apparent reason.  It will feel like you're out of
gas, and you'll see the fuel filter is empty.  You'll have to strong-arm the gas 
cap off, and there will be a huge inrush of air, kind of like after you've 
held your little brother's head under water for 2 or 3 minutes.  In the worst
case, you'll actually cave in the tank!

&gt; now the guy behind the counter is trying to sell me a non-vented cap, I
&gt; thought the cap had to be vented, otherwise your gas tank implodes. He told me
&gt; had never seen a vented tank for a bus.
&gt; 
&gt; anyone know? if i need a vented cap where do i get one?
