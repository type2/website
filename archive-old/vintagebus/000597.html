I think that the early ones (50-58) are MUCH less complicated.
I dont have a good used piece to compare to (mine have disinigrated), but it 
looks like its the same as the top of the front door rubber on the 50-58 
splash pans.
Anyone care to confirm this? Is there another piece of rubber I can use 
instead?

Yep mines got the little grooved seal too, I figured Id just reuse it.

&lt;&lt;These damn busses are way too confusing. I got my gasket info from the
wolfsburg west site. It corresponds to what Frankie is saying. Well basically
it only mentions gaskets for the years 59-67, then 68-72. So i imagine earlier
years are either different or they didn't even have them.

I don't know about the gasket between the splash pan and the bracket, but on
my '65 it is just a square piece of rubber(actually it has tiny grooves cut in
it, but i aimagine a plain old piece of rubber should work fine)
