....66 westy ... Its been sitting engineless for about half a year.  I put a
dual port 1600 in
it that has about 5 k miles since a total rebuild.  It has a doghouse type oil
cooler.  The PO of the engine took out the fan vanes out of it.  I put on a 6
pass external oil cooler on the side of the bus above the air intakes that BTW
have air ducts mounted to push air into the engine compartment.  My intent is
to make this thing run as cold as possible. I also put a VDO oil temp unit in
that uses a stick that goes where the oil dipstick goes.  Also- it has a 30
pic carb on it.  This is unusual by me as the dual ports usually have a larger
carb mount that fits the larger single carbs (34 pic?).  

Heres the problem.  My buddy has this setup and he says his engine stays
around 180 degrees no problem.  My problem is the temps on the highway in this
weekends trip the oil temps were around 230 degrees when I cruised at 55 mph.
When I tried to go 65-70 mph, the oil temp went up to 250 degrees.  The day
was moderate with air temps around 80 degrees.  These temps are hot from what
I know..  Also-  my gas mileage what only about 15 gal. per mile.  It does
seem to be running rich that I have yet to solve.  

Heres my questions:

1.  What &quot;should&quot; the engine oil temps be for a VW engine?
- - - - 
I like to keep it below a boil, but not below about 170 when warmed up.   My
temp guage doesn't guage, so I use the spit test- if it sizzles up right away-
too hot, a bit of a sizzle when I've been freeway driving on a warm day, okay,
else  I should be able to check the oil without dropping the dipstick at
least.

2.  Does the absence of the directional vanes in the engine fan make a good or
bad differance?
- - - -
do you mean the actual blower fan?  That is attached to the generator?
Someone broke some of the blades out?   If so yes- replace your fan  with a
good one (all the blades) and it will blow more cooling air.  Definately do
this- the PO was  a little misled into dismantling the source of cooling air.
If you mean the thermostat vanes- that makes a different before warmup, but
not during most driving.    

3.  Does the smaller carb make a differance?  Is the engine somehow &quot;leaning&quot;
out making it run hotter?  My plans are to put a larger manifold and carb on
it.
- - - - 
a lot of times a SP carb will be mounted to the DP manifold with an adaptor,
as the DP carbs tend to be fussier.  This is fine.  I've done this.  Does not
make it run hot.

4.  How accurate are those oil dipstick temp. gauges?
- - - -
Dunk it in boiling water and find out.

5.  Any other comments for me on making this thing run cooler and making my
vacation pleasurable???
- - - -
check to make sure you don't have anything stuck in the fan, that the cooling
tin is attached everywhere is should be, the pieces of the doghouse are in
place, the engine to body seal is good, etc.  Make sure your air intake on the
air cleaner opens when you push on the gas.   Check the timing with a strobe
light to make sure the distributor advances with increased rpms.     Unless
you have regeared the tranny- keep it to 55.  I agree with the check your rpms
advice- even if you can just borrow one.  The rpm to speed ratio should not
change, so if you write it down you will have the info and can check it
against your other guages.  

Also- the following involves the  rpm discussion - FWIW I have found a
noticable heat increase when running over 3,000 rpms.

I have noticed ongoing questions about engine rpms to vehicle mph relationship
in
old split buses, and I been doing a little research on RPM -MPH correspondence
for
old splits. I have decided to post some printed information from my Factory VW
Workshop manual.  These specs are for stock factory VW buses...running correct
size bias ply tires (as standard radials are usually very much smaller then
the
original Bias-plys...thus giving false MPH readings on some buses.)

Taken from: &quot;`63-`67 Volkswagen Transporter Official VW Workshop Manual ,
Robert
Bentley, pub.&quot;

`63-`64, 3/4 ton vehicle with 1200 cc engine
Maximum speed 60 mph _at_ 3620 rpm   ...

According to VW, these are all safe and permissible speeds/engine rpm's you
can
run in your stock bus.   . Seems VW likes the split bus
engine to run _at_ around 3600 rpms at  top speed.

I do believe that VW is not 100% perfect, and nothing can ever be improved
upon.
but..I just wanted to make note that with correct specifications (ie. correct
compression ratios, octane of fuels, and tire sizes), it is possible to run
your
bus stock at top speed 60-65 mph with the corresponding engine rpms, and not
blow
up your engine or tranny in your bus.  Remember, the bus motor pushes a lot
more
weight, and has a much less aerodynamic designed body then a bug.  I have
heard a
bug runs 60 mph _at_ 3000-3200 rpm give or take...it makes sense that a bus
engine
would need to run at a higher rpm for more power at max. speed. I would also
suspect the higher engine rpms also aids in runs your cooling fan faster to
compensate for the extra heat the motor dispels pushing a much heavier
vehicle.

VW  rated the 25hp motor at 3000 rpms at 46mph standard transmission or 47mph
for the sychromesh transmission, though defined 3150 at max cruising  speed.
Max torque, however is at 2,000 rpms.   

for the 36hp motor, and the max cruising speed is 50mph at 3300 rpms (approx)
max torque still at 2000rpms.

this is for the 1.4:1 reduction gears on the barndoor buses- info is from the
Workshop Manual -VW Transporter 1953/54 , pub 1954 (3rd ed)  VOLKSWAGENWERK
GMBH * WOLFSBERG.

So, the idea is what does that do to drive your bus at the different rpms?   I
found that driving by ear I preferred 3,000 rpms and also the engine ran
cooler at this speed.   I suggest one be careful of that, driving flat out is
not neccessarily a good thing.   They weren't really expecting a lot of
freeway driving when they buildt these buses.   Actually, a lot less places
even  had freeways then. 
  There is a curve with rpms and horsepower- the top of the curve is where the
max torque is , and after that you get less power per extra rpm, and a some
point it drops off to where you can add rpms and get negligable power.      A
lot  car books will show this curve, and will talk about different things you
can do to get much oomph.  

 And so air is blown by the fan to cool the motor.    How hot does the motor
run at different rpms?  Where does the heat  produced by the fuel burning
overbalance the cooling?   

Actually a bus is More aerodynamic than a bug (slightly).  Believe it.   It
has largely to do with the shape of the back-the flat back is better in this
regard.  The  difference in rpms to speed has much more to do with the
reduction gear boxes- the bus has a bug tranny with the ring and pinion turned
around and then gears at the axles to lower the gearing (by 1.4:1 for the
barnddoor, then till about 63  by 1.39:1, and 64-67 1.26:1, I believe- trying
to figure this gearing out, though the final drive also varied ).  Bugs also
have less mass to move, so feel perkier .  Different year  bugs are geared
differently.  The gearing increased through the years to have a faster car
with a bigger motor.  I could dig up info on bug gearing, but I wouldn't have
what it works into as mph.

&gt; The first thing to do is buy or borrow a tach for 15 minute drive and see
&gt; where 1,500 &amp; 3,000RPM are in all four forward gears at what MPH.  You
&gt; probably have a stock geared tranny that does 3,000RPM at or below 50 MPH.
We
&gt; have info on modifying the stock tranny keeping the reduction boxes and
being
&gt; able to do 60+MPH in fourth at 3,000RPM.
