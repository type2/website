&lt;&lt; well upon your suggestion I went to my local vintage dealer today and all
 they could come up with that DIDN'T have power brakes was a 68 style...so I
 im confused. &gt;&gt;
Hi Wade,
The 1971 and later works without the power booster just like a 1967 and 
earlier MC in strength and pedal pressure.  Matter of fact we looked up all 
of these MCs bores and length of strokes to make sure that they would work in 
the earlier buses and found these measurements to be the same.  We have one 
of these in our Westie and one in our panel.  The panel has had this system 
in it for the last 40,000 miles with no problems.  The only trouble with this 
system that we have found so far is that when bleeding the system it is a 
must to have the brake shoes adjusting stars tightened up till the wheels 
will not turn.  Bleed the right forward first, left forward next, then right 
rear, and left rear.  Then after bleeding the brakes adjust the stars so the 
wheels will turn like normal.   Eric&amp;Barb
