&lt;&lt; So I  am going to install the WR1 relay, is it ok for a 6 volt starter?

Hi, 
Try cleaning all the wiring up first, it sounds like a bad connection
somewhere.  As for the brake cylinders including the master cylinder, you
should remove dissassemble, polish the bore with 300 grit wet/dry sand paper,
and inspect the seals.  Then make sure you keep a eye out for any brake fluid
leaks for the next month religiously every time you get in and out of your VW.
