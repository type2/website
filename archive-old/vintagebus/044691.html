Subject: Re: [VB] Safari wiper shafts
To: vwcrewcab62_at_hotmail_dot_com, vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

on the vw wipers through 64 the wiper pivots that go throughthe body can be 
easiely snapped out of the socket connecting to the wiper motor.   For these 
VW made a different wiper pivot that incorporate the disconnects.   

For the 65-67 buses that have the stupid wiper frame, they made disconnects 
that attach to the pivots in the frame.  These dealies you put on outside the 
bus.   I had these on my 65 westy for a summer.  worked fine.  You must use 
the outies if you have the wiper motor frame deal.    You can also use them 
on the 64 &amp;earlier regular pivots instead of getting early disconnects.   use 
the same wiper whichever you do,

I would think that bentley would show both kinds

&lt;&lt; Howdy,
 
 Well, I'm looking forward to receiving my CE Safari's but am a bit troubled 
 about the wiper shaft disconnects.  The ones pictured with the CE kit are 
 the outer style ('65-'67? did they have different wiper arms?).
 
 Looking at the Bentley instructions, they are utilizing an inner style 
 disconnect.  I looked through the VintageBus archive and saw questions about 
 ruining the springs on the wiper arms with the outer style disconnects, but 
 no answers or remedies.  Apparently Wolfgang International sells the earlier 
 (inner style) disconnects for $140 a pair.  What do you all suggest?  If in 
 fact I do need the inner style disconnects, does someone have a pair, or 
 know of good manufacturers of these wiper shafts?
