Subject: RE: [VB] Wiring harness

I second the Wiring Works recommendation. Bob was very helpful for me.
While he didn't offer outright to customize a harness for me, he did
sell me a later harness that has provisions for fuel guage, hazards,
etc. that allow me to customize as needed.

HTH,

Go to http://www.vintagebus_dot_com/wiring for contact info for WiringWorks
-
talk to Bob and maybe he could set something up for you.

&gt; One thing that has bugged me since I got the Single Cab back in '97
was the
&gt; condition of the wiring harness.  I'd like to replace it this spring
and
&gt; would welcome suggestions on where to get a replacement.  I'd like a
high
&gt; quality product as I intend to keep her for a while.  One thing of
interest
&gt; would be a semi custom harness where a few wires could be added for
&gt; additional components.
