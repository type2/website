Subject: headlight bucket color
Mime-Version: 1.0
X-MIME-Autoconverted: from quoted-printable to 8bit by lenti.type2_dot_com id OAA30673

now that I am kind presented with some time, i thought I might repaint the
headlight buckets on my bus. the part that comes out with the light. They have
a little rust forming on the bottom of them.

They are some type of off white, my bus is pearlwhite, is it supposed to match
the bus color...or just be some type of bright white to reflect as much liught
as possible?
