Subject: restoring a '58 to '64 panel
Date: Sun, 25 Mar 2001 18:39:46 -0600

I am restoring a '58 to '62 panel that has a lot of rust around the bottom
and hasn't run since the 70's.  I will have to get new panels to weld in and
I should go through all mechanicals as well.  I will probably farm out the
paint, but I plan on doing the welding and mechanical work my self. Panels
don't have much interior to deal with, so I am not concerned with that. The
books I have bought so far. Seem to have excluded type 2 info, focusing on
type 1 and type 3 VWs instead. Getting to the point, I need a book that
shows me details of body panels and gives me a breakdown on all mechanicals
including the mysterious reduction boxes.


In what respect?  Interior?  Paint?  Engine?
