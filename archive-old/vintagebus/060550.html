&gt; This is a '62 crew cab, and unfortunately the driver's exterior handle has 
&gt; no lock cylinder in it. So, I need one of those handles, preferably with 
&gt; key, but without is ok as well.

Hi Richard,
Driver exterior handle should be easy to find.  Check for Gabriel who does 
lock work for VWs in the archives.

&gt;&gt; I also need an early ignition switch, as mine is the later style, which 
has a &gt; different key.

That is going to be alot harder!  We could not find one of those in usable 
condition for our 1963 SC and had to pull the NOS one we had on the shelf.  
Probably was the last NOS one on the planet....

 I would like to have the whole truck on 1 key if not too &gt; expensively 
&gt; possible. 

Gabriel can do that and he knows how to repin the tool bay door/s for SCs.
