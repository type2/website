I have installed 2 oil temp senders on my bus:

Sender #1 - one in the oil sump plate in place of the drain plug.
Sender #2 - one in the single pressure relief valve hole (SPR case; H series).

I have noted that sender #2 registers at least 15-20 degrees higher than sender #1. I have several suspisions:

a. Variance due to sender reliability - one or both of these are off.

b. Variance due to pressure in pressure relief valve.

c. The engine is a different temperature in each spot.

...or a combination of all of the above.

I plan to install a toggle switch to let me check this dynamically, at various temperature ranges. I have a 500-mile round trip planned this weekend. I'll report back to the list.

Thanks! Joe
