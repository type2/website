&gt;The lightbulb in my license plate light gets quite hot, and I am
&gt;concerned that it will melt the plastic lens (I have seen several
&gt;lenses melted in this manner).  It is still 6 volt and the bulb
&gt;is similar to the ones used in a dome light.  Any ideas on how
&gt;to dim the bulb??

As Thom suggested, a different bulb may be in order.  If your Bus
is still 6v, and you can't find a lower-wattage 6v bulb, a *higher*-wattage
12v bulb might work well.  For example, if your Bus has a 6v 5w license
plate bulb, you might try a 12v 10w bulb, which when operated on 6v will
only draw 2.5 watts.  (A 12v 5w bulb will only draw 1.3w which will
probably be too dim.)

Most auto parts stores have more bulbs behind the counter than they
do out on display, so don't be shy about asking.  They may need to
consult a catalog for the wattage if you don't know which bulb number
you want.  If the Autozone/Checkers/Pep Boys people look at you funny
when you ask for a bulb, try a NAPA store.  They charge more but they
also usually have a greater variety of stuff in stock.

When you find a bulb that works well, remember to make a note of the
bulb number someplace.

Good luck!
