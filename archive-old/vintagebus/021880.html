Subject: RE:  [VB] Full flow case..or just oil pump?

&gt;As I approch rebuilding my engine, I am faced with the problem of using an
external oil cooler to accomodate a larger engine. I am wondering if full
flowing the case or just using a full flow oil pump (the kind with inlet and
outlet on the cover) is a better idea? Any opinions would be greatly
appreciated, I am specifically going to use the Maxi 3 oil pump if I choose
to go the pump route. Thanx! -Christian 63' panel Else &lt;

Since you are going for the larger motor there are a few things to consider.

-  How big and how juiced up?  This will give you an idea of the stress on
the motor and how hot it may run.  When this is determined we can start
sizing up your cooling needs.
-  Bob Hoover claims that the doghouse cooler is good for up to 2.0L
engines...  I do not agree with that totally, but in general you will be
okay with this rule.
-  Add a larger type 4 cooler to a doghouse case.  This is a relatively
straight forward change requiring minimal modifications and should
definitely keep your motor cool enough.
-  Consider a deep sump oil pan.  This will give you some more oil capacity
and cooling efficiency.  Unless you are running a slammed bus or a serious
off road machine this is a cheap and easy upgrade...  In fact I may have
just convinced myself to get one now :)   Note: for a Beatle this is a bad
idea because it will for sure get knocked off and destroy the case.
-  If you must go for an external cooler keep it out of the engine bay,
otherwise you are just heating up the intake air.  Ron Van Ness has a great
trick part from an Audi that takes a doghouse cooler (maybe could use a type
4 also) and mounts it as an external cooler.  
-  The best performing cooler will be a plate style (Mesa) instead of the
tubular aluminum finned type.  If you really want to get fancy there are
some custom Porsche coolers that will do a heck of a great job, but you will
pay top $...  For any of these solutions you would have to have an
incredibly big engine to justify.

Notes:
-  The SS braided and cloth braided oil lines only minimally cool the oil
when it travels.  Use a hard metal line where possible to help cool the oil
in its journey to and from the cooler, I just read this last night from
Bruce Anderson's technical notes in Excellence magazine.
-  You MUST run an oil thermostat with an external cooler.  CB Performance
has one that opens at 170 degrees for $38 with .5&quot; connectors.
-  Most people recommend the Fram HP1 oil filter for the remote oil filter
mount.  the HP1 has a built in pressure relive valve that will help it not
to explode on cold mornings.  I run a PH8 without problems with 10W-40 oil,
might explode when I change to 20W-50....  Kind of curious to have one
explode.  Muuuuhahaha!
-  If you run the tapped full-flow get the Gene Berg oil pump and .5&quot; outlet
cover.  No questions asked, just do it, cost is no factor here.  Granted I
have no idea how much it costs, but I am sure it is more than the Taiwan
crap.
-  Only run the SS braided line with Teflon core.  Again no questions, just
pay the money and do it once in a lifetime.

I run a CB Performance Maxi 3 pump and have had no problems with it.  It is
of aluminum construction and therefore expands and contracts with the motor
correctly and is leak free.  Everyone gives the filter covers a bad rap
because of leaks, but I have seen no problems with this pump.  The downside
is that the outlets are 3/8&quot; and will not support the use of an external
cooler (not enough oil pressure).  I just have a external oil filter hooked
to it which works great.

Also since you are going high performance be sure to get an oil pressure
gauge and oil temperature gauge as well.

I think this is enough rambling on oil for a while ;)
