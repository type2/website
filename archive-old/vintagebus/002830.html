Subject: Re: Hose clamps vs fittings

&gt;I've been using hose clamps on cooler lines for many years with good
&gt;results. I hear people say fittings/hard lines are the best way to go.
&gt;Any comments?
&gt;The oil pressure when an engine is cold is high, but I don't think it
&gt;gets up to 100 psi or does it?

It depends entirely where your cooler is tapped from. If you have replaced
your internal cooler and have one of them little aluminum chingi that ports
the hoses out from under your fan shroud, no the pressures don't get too
high. If your cooler is ported off the oil pump as part of a full flow
setup, the oil pressure can get astronomical. It is prior to the pressure
relief valve and when it is pumping that cold thick oil at startup, your
garden hose could turn into a sprinkler. 8^0&gt; I've got one of those high
volume oil pumps on there and the filter on my full flow is deformed at each
oil change. It's a Mobil HP-1 or somesuch. It stresses the can so much that
the metal is pressed down against the gasket seat, past the gasket, each
time. I am very careful not to rev excessively till the oil warms up, but it
doesn't take much. I'm the proud owner of several oil filter wrenches, which
I go through in sequence until I end up with a screwdriver pounded through
it's black heart and tear it off in little confetti like pieces. YMMV
