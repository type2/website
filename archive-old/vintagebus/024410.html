Steven,

Thanks for your response. I'm quite sure of the originality of the paint on
this '67 Westy. I wouldn't think of repainting it if the primer weren't
showing through in spots - it not only looks tired, but the original primer
alone can't provide adequate rust protection to the steel panels without
sufficient color coat.

I think the reason the painter wants to start with clean metal is to prevent
excessive paint build up, and to assure that the underlying original paint
won't fail thereby ruining his new topcoats. These panels are so straight
I'm nervous about sandblast/heat warpage. I'll discuss your suggestions with
the painter - if he insists on stripping, I'll probably make sure he has the
bus plastic media blasted rather than sandblasted - I've read excellent
reviews on it. PMB won't remove rust, but it won't harm glass or rubber -
there's minimal heat build-up, and no worries about chemical strippers that
can hide in nooks and crannies and come back to destroy the new paint.

Thanks again!

Regards,
Kris Trexler
