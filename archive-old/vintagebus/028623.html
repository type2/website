Hey Gang,
ummmm, bear with me here, I'm a little uncomfortable with my celfone wedged 
up my ass ;)  but anyway...I own a '00 Isuzu Trooper, '87 Porsche 944 and a 
BEAUTIFUL diamond in the rough '58 Westy....I live in San Diego and I have a 
14 year old son.  With that comes all of his 14 year old friends...baseball 
equipment, ski/snowboard gear, golf clubs, bikes, surfboards...well, you get 
the picture.  Just because I live in suburbia, you have to understand, we are 
90 minutes from ski resorts and 2 hours from the desert.  Excuuuse me for not 
wanting a MINI VAN.  I LOVE my SUV, just not quite as much as my VINTAGE VW 
CAMPER!! :)
So in closing, love your VW and don't hate me for needing my SUV.
Laura
