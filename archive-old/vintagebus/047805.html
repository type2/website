&lt;&lt; What are the actual wattage specs for the 6V headlights (say, in 1960)?  I 
think I've tracked my flaky blinkers down to not working when the headlights 
are on, but the headlights don't seem dim. &gt;&gt;
Hi Dworkin,
The Euro style are 45/40 W, can not find the figures for USA sealed beam.  We 
are running 55/60 W H-4s in our 1960 panel with 12 volt system and in our 
1963 SC with 6 volt system.  Niether has any problems with slow or dim 
signals since we completely cleaned all the electrical connections from front 
to rear and tossed the solinoid relay out of the SC!    Eric&amp;Barb
