Subject: Re: [VB] Thermostats...

Actually there is another kind with the all the way around loop, and the 
round hole.
like you say, the ovalled hole is useful for adjusting the thermostat.  

 If you have an older version with the circle hole you can oval it out with a 
drill bit  (BTDT)

Think I have the set up on my 53, think it's the original bracket and 
thermstat to the bus.  Maybe I'll put a picture on vintagebus_dot_com

By the way, the thermostat bracket is the same for all years. Hi Ray,
Not quite!  The 25-36 HP (25-30 bhp) engines use bracket 111 119 151 A
and is
not a full loop around the thermostat and is not slot adjustable in the
up
down direction.
