I know this is probably an unusual request but here goes:

I am contributing editor of a magazine which deals in the meat processing
industry. A month or so ago, an individual named Stewart Alexander, who is
the owner of the Santos Linguisa Factory in San Leandro, shot and killed
three USDA meat inspectors in his sausage factory.
I learned while going through stories posted about this event that Stewart
Alexander; according to the San Francisco Chronicle was a Volkswagen
collector. The Chronicle didn't say what types of VW's he collected but
noted that he had a yard full of old VW's.
Not surprisingly, I got calls from journalists in the food industry who know
that I'm into buses telling me about the fact that this guy has a bunch of
VW's and wondering what will happen to them.
After all; we're pretty sure what's going to happen to Stewart...
Does anybody on the list know about this situation?
I suppose this is a good friday post, but I'll be out in the garage working
on my bus tomorrow and wanted to burn up some office time this afternoon.
thanks
John
