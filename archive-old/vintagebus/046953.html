Cory, what year is your bus?   I believe steering dampers were not normal 
equipment on barndoors.  They were, however, an option, and VW sold parts to 
retrofit one on your barndoor. if you have one, would you please take pics, I 
would loveto see it.

 Hey everyone. The Monroe shocks worked out great but save your old
 shocks cause finding bushings is a bitch.
 
 Anyway can someone tell me if Barndoor steering dampners are the same as
 later models. My front end and steering wheel shakes violently when
 hitting certain types of bumps. 
 
 Is the dampner the problem?
 
 Thanks in advanvce.
