Subject: Road trip to Phoenix!

I know there won't be many from the list going to the Phoenix BOR, if there
are any, stop by the AC.Net booth and say 'Hi'.
:-)

Last minute decision was made to load the bus up and drive it the 1400 mile
round trip, driving non stop (about 13 hours) on friday, and nonstop back on
Sunday. I had enough time last night to change the oil, and will be up late
trying to get the rest of our gear put together tonight. I'd have more time if
it weren't for that marriage reception we have to go to. I haven't done a
drive longer than 400 miles for a few months. Sure hope no gremlins have
gotten in there to foul things up. LOL
