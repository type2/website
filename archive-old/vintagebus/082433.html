Subject: Re: [VB] Big Nut to Freeway Flyer

You can swap the RGBoxes over.   Evidently you can do this with  the tranny 
installed, but I have only done it with the tranny  out.    The axles are the sa
me small nut and big nut, I recommend  pulling them, and using the best 2 of 
the 4, as buses are hard on axle  shafts.  and take it to a pressure washer to 
get it as clean as possible  first... makes it much nicer as this is a grimy 
job. 
 
I have a FF... 3.88 R&amp;P with big nuts and bus (.82) 4th in my 65 Westy  with 
a 1600sp, and it feels a bit under powered. 
    the 4.375 R&amp;P w/ big nuts in my 61 with 205 75 15  tires is a good combo 
I think... pulls hills well,  drive 60 to  65mph.  
 
but with 14&quot; rims, a 4.125 might be compensate for the smaller  wheel/tires.
 
you can pull the ring gear out and count teeth to see what the r/p is on  the 
big nut tranny... maybe go to a 4.12 r/p if that's what you have in the  
spare tranny.  in any case, you will notice a definate higher gearing with  the 
big nuts, and a definate loss of power if you go to a FF with big  nuts.
 
hoper this helps.

greetings... its been a while since ive posted, but i have a tranny  related 
question. i currently have a '66 with a stock 1500sp and a small  nut tranny. 
runs smooth and quiet and shifts nice.

BUT, i am  finally tired of cruising at 52 mph and my club members leaving me 
in  their dust on roadtrips. i have a big nut tranny drum to drum in my  
garage. been sitting for 5 years. what would i need to turn this into a  
freeway flier? and where can i source the parts?

additional thought  i had... can i put the big nut axles and redux boxes on 
the small nut  tranny?

thanks,
