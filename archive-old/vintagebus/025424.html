&lt;&lt; &gt; Has any one ever heard of the lower &quot;mountain gears&quot; that 
  were optional in the splits for the reduction boxes?  &gt;&gt;&gt;

-with-
 
 &lt;&lt; This is M code 92.... But, I understood that this option involved 
different  gearing in the transaxle and not the reduction boxes.&gt;&gt;&gt;
 

Hello,

Not sure of the M code number but these are the 1.68 ratio reduction
spur gear and matching stub axle.  I've read about these (and other
ratio options) but have not yet run across them during teardowns.  I've
only seen the plain-Jane 1.39 ratio in the pre-'63s and the 1.26 ratio
in the post-'64s so far.
