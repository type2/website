Actually I have heard of these &quot;greasewagons&quot; in Germany.  Unlike Americans,
Europeans actually care about the ecology and fuel consumption.  As a
result, turbo diesels are becoming increasingly popular and alternative
fuels such as grease are being used.  My freind says that when he get behind
one of these diesels converted to burn grease on the autobahn it smells like
french fries.  Much better than stinky diesel or gas fumes!

I was probably one of the few people that was happy to see gas prices reach
$2 per gallon and I am rather pissed that prices have fallen off again.  I
was hoping that high gas prices would thin out the SUV population more than
a bit, but I guess I have no choice now than to mount a Katuscha  rocket
launcher in the bed of my single cab an take a few out myself.  :-)
