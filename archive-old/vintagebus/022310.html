I hadn't checked my mail all day and when Brian came in and informed me of
the news I must say it caught me totally by surprise as I am sure it did
many of you.

I met Josh the first time last year at BBTA.  I was introduced to him by
Ginger Nipps.  She and Josh were standing around talking and I just sort of
strolled into the conversation.  I remember seeing him the first time and
saying, &quot;Man what a little pretty-boy jerk.&quot;  

You know how first impressions can be so totally inaccurate?  Well this was
certainly the case.  

Josh was as kind as anyone I have ever met.  Even when he disagreed with
you there was never discontent.  He carried himself with dignity and honor,
and that is all any of us can strive for.  I only wish I could have been
there to stop him from doing this terrible thing.

I am glad this man came into my knowing.  He was good, and bad, and had one
heck of a great bus, you can't go wrong with his chosen colors.

I will pray for his family and friends, among them I count myself.  

I will miss him, but I will also think of him often.

You were a good man Josh Rodgers!


Thanks for tolerating the rambling's.
