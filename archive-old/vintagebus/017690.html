In reading this thread, I'm seeing one thing in common, and its the 28PICT!



  &gt;&gt;
my first split, a early 59  with split case tranny and 1500 H case sp motor  
lower compression on #3 (120, 120, 105, 120), 28 pict carb, 009, always got 
31 MPG.   Even if my speedo/odo was off, on various trips I took, cross 
country/ up and down the Pacific coast, it was very cheap to drive.
