I guess I should have mentioned that it's not a runner and my hipo 
chevy parts inventory  has run a little dry since the last 3 nascar 
and top fuel drag racing seasons(joke)..so I'm probably not going to 
sink a whole lot o money into gettin' 'er goin' again ...but I will take 
some pics and post them soon(it is a show weekend so time short 
till monday or so)
