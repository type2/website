Water will drain no matter what, as the bus is seldom level.  Holes to let
air through will actually increase drag, as can be seen by checking out
aircraft drag brakes.

If you want to decrease drag and crosswind effects, add a panel that
connnects the front of the rack with the roof, so that air isn't channeled
between the rack and the roof.
