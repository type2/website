Hi Kyle,
Yes, but what happens when you install the wrong bumper?  Does the bus/truck 
fall off of tall cliffs?  Since rims are alot more important to keeping the 
VW on the road and not suddenly off of it the parts book would have shown it 
if there was a problem of this magnitude.  Thusly if the crow foot rims was 
to be a significant reinforcement for trucks and panels only....  Plus so far 
we only have been able to find one non-crow foot rim dated before 1960.  This 
would mean that we only can find truck or panel rims?  When more kombis, 
westies, deluxes were imported to the USA?  Eric&amp;Barb
