&gt; not my bus..but it is my work! the roof section was replace due to a
&gt; large wavy hole cut for a roof veny/scoop the metal was very
&gt; distorted in that area so I felt it would be best to replace the rear 3rd
&gt; of the roof from the rear support back! this is not a hack job..please
&gt; don't rfer to other peoples hard work as a hack....
