My SC had been seeping oil from various places since I had bought it, I had 
no idea when if ever the engine had been apart, but it ran well. At least 
until Kelley Park.  At Kelley Park the oil cooler seal had decided that it 
had enough, so it began leaking. This convinced me that it was time to do the 
seal job that I had been putting off and take care of all the seeps and leaks 
all at once.
    I planned to start a week ago Thursday but on Wednesday night I had the 
leads to the rear fog light ground out on my GLI filling the car with smoke 
and an unpleasant burnt plastic smell. I instead spent Thursday with the 
dashboard apart tracking down melted wires, and getting everything back 
together by 6:00.  Why the 6:00 deadline ask? Because I was planning to meet 
a young lady for dinner in San Carlos at 7:30.  I got the GLI wrapped up at 
5:45. Wow! I got 15 minutes to spare. I quickly pull the engine out of the SC 
and into the garage, plus get the tools cleaned up and put away.
    My next day off was this past Tuesday. I roll out of bed at the crack of 
noon (I am a swing shift worker) and start in dismantling the engine.
    The first setback was an exhaust stud that was just sitting and spinning. 
Hmmm, OK I'll pull the head off with the heater box attached and tend to it 
later.  I pop the valve covers off and remove the rocker arms. Great, one of 
the nuts on the head studs was loose. That's why it was running doggy on the 
way back from KP.  Good thing I was taking care of this now!
    The second set back wasn't nothing too bad, but really annoyed me. I 
start to loosen the top head stud nuts when the studs start spinning also.  
After I got the heads off I doused the nuts in liquid wrench, and holding the 
stud with vise grips I removed the nuts. I cleaned up the threads and put 
some locktite on them before reinstalling.
    After getting the engine dismantled I return to setback #1.  I use a die 
grinder to remove the offending nut, and discover that there are not very 
many treads left on the exhaust stud. It was really rusted. I put some liquid 
wrench on it and after it sits for a while I put the stud removal tool on it 
and give it some muscle. Nothing happens. I break out the propane torch and 
heat it up a bit. Nothing happens. I heat it up a lot, tap it with a hammer, 
and apply more liquid wrench. This time something happens, yup, the stud 
sheered.  I decide to take a few hours off at this point and listen to the 
Red Sox game over the Internet. Pedro shuts out the Blue Jays 8-0. 
    I eat dinner and go back out into the garage. I ask my Dad to put in the 
main oil seal.  My Dad has owned VW's since 1969 and has an excellent track 
record in non-leaking main oil seals. I think only one ever leaked.  Mine are 
guaranteed to leak. I don't know why. I follow his teachings exactly.  At any 
rate he asked me where the seal is and that brings us to setback #3. I have 
no seal. I thought there was one here somewhere! I decide to call it a night 
and resume tomorrow.
    I wake up early (10:00) and drive down to Small Car World in Albany.  I 
wouldn't call them a FLAPS, just a LAPS, but they are the closest. As I park 
I notice a sign on the door that states they are closed due to a computer 
failure. Setback # 4.  I end up going to my friends shop here in Pinole. 
Luckily he has what I need.
    I then tend to that pesky exhaust stud. I end up drilling it out and 
installing a step stud. I then make some really good headway    getting parts 
degreased, the pushrod tubes installed and the rocker arms fitted.  While I 
am waiting for parts to dry my brother Joel comes into the garage and tells 
me he has some spare time to fix the CD player in my GLI, I get side tracked 
with this, plus dinner and the realization that I have no work clothes, so 
another time out was required for some washing and ironing.     
    My engine tin is now dry, my dad has the main oil seal installed, and 
decides to help further by scraping some of the crud off the cylinder fins.  
Suddenly he stops and peers down between the fins. He adjust his head to make 
better use of his bifocals and then asks (in his 
son-did'nt-I-teach-you-better-than-this tone of voice) &quot;Didn't you remember 
to put the little air deflectors back on?&quot; I explain that I never took them 
off. &quot;I don't think there are any on there&quot; I walk over and put my hand up 
between the cylinders and the pushrod tubes. Nada. Houston, we have setback 
number five.
    Goody, I get to take apart everything I just torqued down and redo it. I 
find an extra set of deflectors in the household parts inventory.  I install 
the defectors, stretch the pushrod tubes out, install them and torque 
everything back down.
    I put the intake, cooling tin, and clutch on. All that's left is the 
muffler. I get up to get the gaskets off the workbench. Or try to. My back is 
not cooperating. I decide to call it a night. Besides it's 2:15 AM.
    I planned to put the muffler on when I get home from work on Thursday 
night but some idiot decided to run through the airport security checkpoint.  
The whole staff gets held over to dispatch flights that are being held while 
the terminal was evacuated and the bomb sniffing dogs searched the area.  A 
bit of a setback, but the overtime I earned will buy me something cool at 
Bug-o-Rama.  I finally get home about 1:45 AM to find my Dad had gotten bored 
and not only put the muffler on but installed the engine into the SC. (I 
think he was at work all day wishing that I wouldn't finish up, so he could.  
When most Dads retire they go fishing or play golf. Mine plans to work at 
Letcher Bros. VW repair)
So, with some timely assistance from my Dad I have beaten Murphy!  Dad was 
going to go up to Vallejo to the Split Bus Club truck meet in it, but since I 
had to work I don't know if he made it up there or not.
