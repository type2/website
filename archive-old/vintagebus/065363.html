Get one of the cheepo Harbor Freight touch up guns, spray the stuff, then
toss the gun.

&gt; After finishing off the front window frames and inside the front doors I
&gt; have started stripping the bed in preparation for a coating of POR-15.
&gt; Since it is a large area I would like to spray on the two coats.  I am
&gt; looking for suggestions on what type of spray gun to use for this?  This
&gt; time I will also be using the Tie-Coat as a primer and have some solvent to
&gt; clean up with.
