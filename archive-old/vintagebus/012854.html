well thanks for the advice so far.

Basically this is what I have done so far...
I checked the valve cover gaskets, they looked fine(neoprene relatively new).

I checked teh spark plugs(probably not related, but real easy to check) they
had some black soot on them, and the two on teh right had some evidence of oil
on them, although not past the threads.

I was about to work on my timing, and I noticed that the fan belt was
slipping. So I took out one shim, not it is tight but not too tight(I don't
think).

i did a lot of looking under the engine, and couldn't realy find any obvious
problems.

Then when I went to look at the engine again, I noticed the whole thing looks
as though it has rotated about the longitudinl axis of the bus, about 2
degrees. Now I don't know if it was always like that or not, so I wasn't sure
if there was any remedy.

Any way I tried running it again today, no oil light. Took it for a spin,still
no light. Tried the highway, still no light. I think everything is ok, I guess
it was the loose fanbelt, although that doesn't really make sense to me.
