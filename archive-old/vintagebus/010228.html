&gt;Thanks for all the tips about my bus not wanting to stop...the general
&gt;consensus was that it is either on of two problems:
&gt;
&gt;Shut off solenoid broken
&gt;
Unless I am mistaken, this can easily be tested by turning the ignition on,
removing the wire from the solenoid, and verifying that a 'click' is heard
when you touch the wire to the solenoid.

Also verify that the power wire to the solenoid is coming from the +
(ignition key) side of the coil.
