It is for the radio speakers you mount in the factory brackets in the upper 
rear corners.

Hey all. Can anyone tell me what the extra wire leading all the way back
along the roof line and down out near the rear hatch hooks up to. This
is for a 58 Deluxe. Is it for a heated rear window? It is a factory wire
and I have seen them on other buses but was just curious cause I've
never seen it hooked up. Also there is no mount for an extra dome light
so I figured it wasn't for that.
