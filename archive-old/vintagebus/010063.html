Does anyone have a part number for the side cover gasket on a 60 steering
box?

Does anyone have one for sale?

Would making my own with different-from-stock gasket paper alter the
space/time continuum?

I noticed someone stamped marks onto the shaft coming out of the box, and a
line on the arm that seems to imply they should be aligned.  Was this done
at the factory? Or has someone been into this one before? Mine is one tooth
off. I'll be pulling the arm to put in a new seal, should I put it back as
found, or line up the marks? Will one tooth matter?
