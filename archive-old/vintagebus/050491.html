CONGRATULATIONS CONGRATULATIONS CONGRATULATIONS!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Wait at least until she's picking up a spoon before teaching valve
adjustments. :-)

Since you had a daughter, I'll relate a story to you.
The ignition module on my wife's Berretta had failed and I went to get a
new one.
My 12 yo daughter asked what I was up to and then if she could do the
work.
That's fine with me, First you have to take out the radiator, fan shroud,
just to get to where we have to go, you still want to do it?
Where's the wrench dad?
about 2 hours later, she climbed out from under the car after tightning
the last bolt.
What's next?
I handed her the keys and said &quot;go start the car&quot;
Really????
Her smile and wide eyed excitement when the car fired right up, was worth
every second.
She went into the house covered in grease, at which my wife screamed
&quot;what did you do to my baby?&quot;

She's still proud of that day, and was telling her friends in the car
just last week about the story.

Enjoy your daughter, she will bring you endless joy!

Congratulations,

Scott

&gt; Well since its Friday and a few people have asked...
&gt;
&gt;   Lisa and I had a little girl on September 8, 6lbs,6oz
&gt; 19&quot; long (which is why we missed Jerome)! I brought Lisa
&gt; and Emma home in the New beetle, but look forward to our
&gt; first family outing in the DC! It might be to the
&gt; Central California Volks Folks meeting on Monday the 8th.
&gt;   Also, I turn 30 on the 5th and it looks like I will be
&gt; getting a garage for my birthday! Woo hoo!! As a bonus
&gt; the garage will probably come with a house.
&gt;
&gt;  ....so how long do I have to wait to teach Emma how to
&gt; adjust the valves on the Double Cab??
