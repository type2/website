&gt; Okay fellow 'fornians, let's see what we can get out of this...
&gt; 
&gt; Just paid my registration and my camper's body type is listed as HSCR.
&gt; What the heck is HSCR, I asked...checked out the DMV's website and no
&gt; joy...the closest thing was HR (hearse..not quite).  Has anyone with lots
&gt; of &quot;dealing with DMV&quot; experience ever come across this body type and what
&gt; it means?
&gt; 

A housecar, in DMV parlance, is a vehicle with living arrangements inside
that is not used for general hauling.  Motorhomes, Westys, and pickup
campers (where the camper is never removed from the pickup) all qualify as
housecars.  The fees are typically lower for a housecar than they are for
a truck, but they are the same as a passenger vehicle.

HSCR is the correct slot for a camper to be in.  It would be
inappropriate for a panel or a microbus/station wagon
