Subject: 1963 Roadrunner Camper for sale in W. Wash

Hi Volks,
This is not our bus!  So please contact Chris in the Olympia area _at_ 
360-264-5499.

  Chris trailered this bus out of California, from the second owner he bought 
it from. It was originally Ruby Red and the DPO painted the top half white to 
better reflect heat from the sun.  He proceeded to completely dissassemble 
the bus to a shell including all the suspension except the swing plates.  So it 
would take a weekend to put the suspension back in place for towing or an auto 
trailer to cart it away.   He also sanded off areas of paint to remove small 
amount of bondo to reveal the few shallow dents in the body.  These areas in 
the three years since then have surface rusted.  The only rust through in this 
bus appears to have is just behind the cargo doors and the front floors.  
Though we could not see much of the cargo floor from all the junk inside covering 
it.  He did have the complete camper interior, but after storing them for 
several years decided he could make a better, new interior of his own design.  So 
he got rid of the wood cabinets and kept things like the table, camper 
windows, and hinges for the bed.  He wants to get $600.00 for this bus and has the 
tent for an extra amount.
