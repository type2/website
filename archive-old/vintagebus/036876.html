Hola listees-
(Soy estan el siete de mayo)
sorry still hung over from the fifth of may....

in a nutshell,   my 67 and her last 27 owners thought they knew what they
were doing... however my electrical system seems to be less than Frau
Nordhoff designed it to be...  Any clues as to the best after market
harness...?????
I am so close to 'on the road' with your precious split-window,  I can smell
the viscosity!
