Subject: RE: [VB] belt broke / ouch hot gen?

&gt; covers on. the air gets sucked in through the bottom hole on the generator
&gt; and should be vented through the backing plates. the slot on the backing

Sucked in through the gen? I was sort of ecpecting that it would blow out
from the gen. Isnt the backing plate on the blowing side of the fan?

&gt;the slot on the backing
&gt;plate must face downwards when installed in the fanshroud. (i'm assuming
&gt;we're talking 12v generator here). yes, there is a proper orientation for
&gt;all of it. i don't have a diagram, but could probably supply a pic if
&gt;necessary

This is just the sort of info I was anticiopating.
Thanks much.
