I run 205 75/R15's on all my early busses, and my odometer is correct to 
within one mile in two hundred on my '59 camper, so the diameter must be 
close.  It is tough for an old man to climb up into the cab of my busses, but 
tall is cool!

I buy cheap tires here in the southwest at Peerless Tire, and my local dealer 
is very helpful, but then I buy a lot of tires and recommend them to many 
people.  $100 to $120 bucks for a set of tires is very reasonable for 35000 
mile tires.

Still hoping for early (SO-23 and SO-34) parts - check your attics and 
garages.
