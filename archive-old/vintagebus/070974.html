Subject: tight shoes fixed

Between the woodburn show and work on the house I didn't get back to the
brakes until today. In the end the shoes just didn't fit, the friction
material was much too thick. One rubbed only at the top and bottom edge but
the other rubbed across the whole surface of the friction material. I bought
a different brand and they went right on no problem.
