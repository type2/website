Subject: Re: [VB] Got my birth certs! time to start cutting in the walkthru

&quot;Tauben&quot; translates to &quot;Dove&quot; in german. My Westfalia
has a sticker behind the frontseat stating that!

&gt; I emailed my Credit card information to the VW
&gt; museum exactly 3 weeks ago
&gt; and today my 2 birth certificates arrived. They
&gt; charged my card $30.90. the
&gt; extra 90¢ was charged due to my request of &quot;an Mcode
&gt; list and any addtional
&gt; information you could provide on my buses, I would
&gt; be happy to pay for&quot;.  I
&gt; got a copy of their mcode list and also a listing of
&gt; paint code
&gt; numbers,names and what upholstery was supposed to
&gt; match it ( Commercial
&gt; stuff only, 1950-1964) Interesting to note that
&gt; nowhere do they refer to
&gt; 'dove blue' or duvblau, they only call it
&gt; 'Taubenblau' (the whole list is
&gt; all in german btw). yet on my birth certificate they
&gt; call it dove blue.
&gt; 
&gt; everything seems to be in order on my barndoor
&gt; certificate except that it
&gt; says my panel has Mcode 083 which they say is
&gt; &quot;walkthrough cab&quot;.. but my
&gt; bus is not a walkthru.
&gt; Looking at their Mcode list, they have 4 walkthru
&gt; mcodes, 80,81,82,83.
&gt; 80 is called out as being specific for a panel bus,
&gt; walkthru.
&gt; My only guess is this list isnt early model specific
&gt; and 83 meant something
&gt; else back in the day?
&gt; 
&gt; My bus also had snow tyres, Laminated front glass,
&gt; and 018 and 086 not
&gt; identified.
&gt; heres a scan of the cert

&gt; 
&gt; My 57 SC cert has nothing special on it, Mcode 360
&gt; unidentified, USA
&gt; delivery
