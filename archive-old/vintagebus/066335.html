Subject: RE: [VB] Tips on nose replacement needed

  I know that the drivers side door pillar on your bus needs total
replacement. Knowing the bus from previous owners it will need a complete
nose clip with at least the drivers side door post complete.

Subject: [VB] Tips on nose replacement needed


No, I'm not talking about a plastic surgery on my nose but rather about
replacing nose skin on my
Bus. For now it looks fair... well, sort of but is full of bondo and the &quot;A&quot;
pillar is a little bent
out of shape... door doesn't shut properly and hinges are bent.

So..... all these parts I'm going to get from a donor Bus - whatever I want
to replace (need to
replace the nose skin, the &quot;A&quot; pillar and part of the dogleg) and it was
suggested to me that
instead of just replacing the nose skin I should go for the entire nose
section including dash and
heat tube. What in your opinion is easier to do? What should be done to get
the best final result?

For now it's OK but I'm getting a little cold because of the gap between the
door and the pillar...

all you opinions will be greatly appreciated.
