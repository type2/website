  Could the rollers on your door stops be sticking? Takes a little extra
ooumph on the container van to close the doors till I lubed the rollers good

Subject: [VB] lubricating front door


My passenger side door has seemed hard to close for a while now, as though
it is not lubricated properly, but I have lubricated it all I can, I pulled
the door panel off, and it appears as though the lower hinge -the plate that
actually passes through the door-appears to be rubbing, but it is slatehred
in grease-i put on last year...

any ideas on why this would be acting up. it has been doing this for months,
but  I never figured any cause, and I have lubricated the hinges...
