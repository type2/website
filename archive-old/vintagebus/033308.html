Gotta '62 Standard somone wants to sell me...it's a small window in the
hatch...has no engine....needs a total brake rebuild.  Several rust spots
where metal is rusted through but nothing that is too hard to fix.  He wants
150$ for it...it's got all the interior all paneling and seats and
everything..everything on it is original 165000 miles on it and I'm putting
in a rebuilt engine.....Is it worth it?
