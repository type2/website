Subject: Re: bus tool box?

&gt;Does anyone actually know what is in the black hole void under the
&gt;front seats in their bus?

When I got mine, there was some miscellaneous dirt and trash, change,
a plastic Shell Oil thing[0], a tropical fish refrigerator magnet,
an empty pack of Marlboros[1], four matchbooks (AAMCO in San Jose CA,
Clark's Auto Parts and Machine in Cupertino CA, and two from E-Z 8
Motels CA/AZ/NV), and a California gold-on-blue plate, &quot;EDCVOSS&quot;, no
year stickers.

Now it's clean.  The cargo area is full of spare parts and tools and
stuff, though.  I have discovered that it's a good place to look when
the Bus is hungry and swallows items that I left on the front (bench)
seat.  Eventually I will probably have the jack and lug wrench back
in there.

[0] It's a little hard clear plastic thing about 1&quot;x2&quot; with a little
    pocket in the lower half.  The top has old Shell logos.  The back
    has a remnant of what appears to be double-stick tape; I think
    maybe you stuck this on your dash and put your gas receipts or
    something in it.
[1] Inspected and verified free of any non-tobacco products.  The only
    places on my Bus not so inspected are the trim panel behind the
    cargo doors, to the right of the back seat and the trim panels in
    the sides of the luggage compartment.
