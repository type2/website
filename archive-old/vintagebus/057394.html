Subject: Re: [VB] Sealing Westy Windows?

Find dum-dum at your FLAPS or online at ...
http://www.drclassic_dot_com. Try asking for strip caulk at 
the home supply stores. 
Silicone will do the job if you don't want it to come 
apart. Ever. 
I use dum-dum to seal my safaris during the rainy 
season. 

BTW, two well known Fresno bus drivers took first in 
their classes at the Madera Spring Fling last Sunday.

 -Harry in Fresno
&gt; What are folks using to seal between the Westy Window and the Frame that
&gt; attaches to the Bus?  The Material that was in there looked like
&gt; something we, in the Autobody field, use to call Dum Dum Putty.  I
&gt; thought I had heard of someone here mention that before.  Lowes doesn't
&gt; seem to carry it.  So I guess it will be Silicone Chalking.
