Hi,
Were the single cab side and tailgates the same for
all the years, and if not, when did they change?  I
think I know where a set is from 66? singlecab--as far
as I know it is all that the PO kept when it succumbed
to the ravages of driving it year round in Wisconsin
where in winter the roads are covered with salt.
Wish I lived closer to California, oh well.

Jim (in Wisconsin)
