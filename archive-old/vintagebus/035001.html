Hello everyone,

Well, the day started off pretty damn early. My brother Everett and I got 
into San Jose about ten to 7am to find an extremely long line,(around 200 
cars deep)which was the biggest surprise of the day. I've been going to this 
show for at least the past 6 years and have never seen one this big.
Morning started off good meeting up with John Howard and Ronnie from Az. and 
chatting with them while in line. Talked about the Red Barn swap meet the 
night before. I might just have to make it there next year. Seems like there 
are some good deals.
The line to get in took around an hour of winding through the new parking 
lot, (what an odd way to get in), and finally got a nice spot to part in 
right near the swap meet. 

Since I need very few parts to complete my deluxe, I've been spending my hard 
earned money on toys, so while my brother looked for those hard to find 
barndoor and split parts, I kept my eye out for some good toys. I scored an 
early Tekno Phillips bus which was actually made in 53-54 and is an actual 
barndoor toy (mint shape C-9.5) cost a pretty penny at $145. Lots of other 
toys out there just; a few Buddy L ski busses, tonkas, TippCo, Japanese 
Batt/ops, and lots of European toys from the 50-60's. Rich Salazar always has 
a great stack of rare and hard to find early tin and die-cast toys. Only 
downfall is that they are extremely expensive. Not your typical $20-30 price. 
Mostly in the few hundred dollar range.
Swap meet had some decent things in it, but mostly overpriced NOS and rare 
pieces I don't need. What I do need is a passenger rear corner deluxe trim 
for 15/23 window busses. No luck Sunday though. Too many parts to dig through 
when I don't need much. Always on a hunt for what other people want though.
Car show area had tons of cars, must have been because of the damn nice 
weather. Lots of splits and ovals. I really liked the 48 split for sale that 
needed restoration for $18K. Looked to be mostly complete.
Lots of nicely restored busses; the 55 barndoor panel was really clean and 
seemed to represent it's mileage well at around 60K original. Said to be made 
within a week of my brothers 55 Kombi. Strange to see one that close in 
production from so long ago.
Tony and Pat Olmoe had their newly restored 62 vert that was done body off 
the pan. Unbelievable to see something so clean that you could eat off it. 
Bug was bought off the original owner and was a low mileage car in mint 
shape.  
Nice to meet some more list members, met Roger and bought a copy of the local 
tool manufacture book. Can't wait to read it and find out what tools I want 
to have made. Met up with Ronnie, John, Greg, Thom, and a few others that 
were around the vintage bus_dot_com bus of Thom's. Ate lunch with Craig after the 
show and talked more VW's and then headed home.
All in all it was a great show to start the Norcal events. Probably nothing 
this year will ever compete with it.
The only downfall was the line to get in and other people with nice vintage 
busses being turned away. I think we need to make sure that the water-cooled 
cars and ch*vy's don't make it inside next year. More vintage policing will 
go a long way.

Until the next show, Sac. Bug-O-Rama and the Classic in June,
Dave Barnes
