Myself I always pack tools and stuff when I take a trip.   I rarely need them 
much- maybe to adjust the wiper arms and if its a long trip do a tuneup 
partway through (I take an oil change pan too).   I had made money on Dead 
Tour fixing other peoples buses- changing oil seals (pulling motors) in a 
camp site, tuneups  etc, and tools come in useful when I find a junkyard.  I 
dont *expect* my bus to fall apart on the trip, but I take them just in case. 
 I did have to remove and re hook up the wiper motor in my 61 on the way to 
Kelley Park two years ago- with out tools I would have had to wait as it was 
raining so hard I could not see.  (the set screw holding the drivers side arm 
to the motor came loose, so that side stopped wiping- had to remove the motor 
to tighten the set screw).   I did have to replace a broken fan belt once.  
etc  I mean, this IS a 40 year old vehicle, and though I do try to keep the 
bus in good nick so I do not tend to have major problems on the road,  I have 
not thrown enough money/time at it to think it is like new and I am not 
surprised if there are a couple minor issues along the way.  The road trip I 
took just after I got the 61 it  came back in better shape and more complete- 
changed both cab door mechanisms, found a rear deluxe bumper, correct grab 
bar, etc.  

I think the mindset comes from living with the machinery. I am not cringing 
with fear, but realistically since I have only had ACVWs, and have found it 
way too expensive to pay someone to not fix it right, I started carrying 
tools with me.  Yes they are old and yes they occasionally want tinkering 
with.   Once you get them fat and happy they are not demanding, especially if 
it is one with a cheery sturdy personality, but now and then something will 
happen.  Especially if you are not prepared.

&gt;  It's almost as if we have some kind of peculiar mindset that has us 
cringing
&gt;  in fear of journeying in our VW buses that are, mechanically at least, as
&gt;  well maintained as the vehicles of our fellow travelers.  They have no
&gt;  qualms about heading off into the sunset/sunrise in their tired old sedans
&gt;  or vans, dealing with any problems as they arise but probably arriving at
&gt;  their destinations unscathed.
&gt;  
&gt;  Is it machinery or mindset that makes the difference in our approach to
&gt;  traveling?  Experience with some folks the past couple of years who drive
&gt;  VWs long distances, but approach their campers as they would a typical US
&gt;  vehicle, has me beginning to wonder.
&gt;  
&gt;  FWIW.....
