Subject: axle nut

Hi Jen that's easy?
Take how much you weigh and divide that be the desired torque setting.
the result is the length of the lever you need.  Get a breaker bar and
slide a pipe on the end.  Measure from the socket along the bar the
distance you got in the above equation.  Put all your weight at that
point on the bar and voila! instant torque.  This works good only if
you're honest about your weight!

Hi,

We want to remove and eventually re-torque the rear axle nuts. It's a
46mm
nut and requires 217 fl lbs according to the manual. We have a 150 ft lb

torque wrench and we're looking for a cheap torque multiplier to use
with it
other than the 'torquemeister'? We'd rather not spend $200+ dollars for
that
with the attachments needed. Can't seem to find any torque multipliers
around here. Also, we can't seem to find a 46mm socket at any of our
local
stores.
