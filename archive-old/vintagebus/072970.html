Subject: Re: [VB] EMPI

I honestly wasn't going to, as I knew how bad they were; but I was stuck
between a rock and a hard place and had to have a muffler.  That was the
only one I could get that I didn't have to order and wait for it to be
shipped here.
---------------------- Clip -----------------------
I wasn't knocking EMPI, Bug Pack or any manufacturer or distributor.
Consider that there would only be about 10% as many VWs running without
these guys.
There just aren't that many games in town.
