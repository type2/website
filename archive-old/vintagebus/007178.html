Subject: Overseas License Plates wanted

I've got a couple of license plate holders from overseas and I'd like to
mount them with some plates on my bus.  Does anyone have a neat set of
plates from Germany or anywhere else that they would like to sell me?
Something custom would even be better but I'd settle for just some old
expired plates in decent shape.  Thanks!
