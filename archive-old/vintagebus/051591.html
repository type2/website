&gt; i am not sure about magnetized oil screens(not enough metal, and you dont want
&gt; the screen to get clogged with any metal particles. Maybe you mean a magnet

&gt; of spring or clip type thing that attached it to the filter. not really sure
&gt; if it helped much, it never seemed to have anythign on it, i washed it off at
&gt; every oil change. One mechanic I spoke with told me they werent much use
&gt; because the engine block particles were not ferrous(ie they wont stick to a
&gt; magnet) but there are other parts that will, but these are not likely to break
&gt; down into tiny particles.

I run the cow magnet strapped to the pick-up tube, but you have to run a
deep sump with added pickup tube.  I have also used the magnet type I
think Harry is talking about.  It's a ring magnet, ceramic covered that
just fits inside the strainer plate nuts and around the drain plug.  I
would pry the magnet off with a big screwdriver at oil change time.  They
are really strong magnets.  After loosing two cams in one engine I have
seen that it can help.  I had a fram HP1 full flow filter the first time
and the bearings were trashed, crank needed polished.  The second time the
cam/lifters were much worse, but running a K&amp;N 3002 filter the bearings were
perfect.  Both times the cow magnet had lots of metal sticking out on it
so it did what it could.  Filters are better than magnets in my opinion,
but I figure use any thing that helps.
