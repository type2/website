Subject: Re: [VB] new tires/trip to South America

You might want to look into Bridgestone Dueler A/T's. I have some on my
R%nger and was so impressed with the quiet smooth ride that I put a set of
P205-75's on my bus. I only have 250miles on them and no freeway miles but
so far I like them except that they don't fit behind my passenger seat in
the spare tire well. I will need to get a narrower one for the spare, maybe
a 195. BTW I had them installed with all the fancy raised white lettering on
the inside.
