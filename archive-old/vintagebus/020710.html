Subject: Driving on the Playa

Here in Northern Nevada, Playa is the normal and
accepted term for the Black Rock Desert and the other
lesser known &quot;dry lake beds&quot;. 
As for traveling across the Playa in any kind of group
situation, just go for it without any real concerns,
the dust is not bad on your bus and there are people
around to save your ass when needed. 
I've taken my 67 out there for days on end and I don't
take any special mechanical precautions. Do bring lots
o water and understand that the weather can turn NASTY
without any warning. 
If you get a chance...get away from the group and
enjoy some real solitude and see the stars like you've
never seen them before.
I had to hike out of the Black Rock Desert once, no
fun at all. 
Remember*** Shit Happens ***

*************************************************
Was Writ

 I am taking my 67 21DLX and camping for a week on the
playa, a (mostly) dried, prehistoric lake bed. I will
be traveling off road about five to fifteen miles on
the playa to camp site (could be thirty miles round 
trip off road). A good number of vehicles will be
attending, causing a lot of this dust to be airborne.
Also, dust storms occur from time to time.

Although &quot;playa&quot; is the correct technical term for
this landform, most
folk call them &quot;dry lakes&quot;.
&gt;
&gt; Questions: (1) Would a paper air filter or stock oil
bath filter be 
more
&gt; effective in this situation? (2) Round trip is 1,200
miles. Would the 
dusty
&gt; conditions require that I change the motor oil
before making the trip 
home?
&gt; What would you do? I have no external motor oil
filter system, 
running a
&gt; 1776. (3) Any tips or FYI on any preventive actions
I could take to 
lessen
&gt; the dust contamination in my bus? When back home, I
will give my bus 
a good
&gt; rinse, under, in and all around.

30 miles of dirt road are really nothing for a stock
filter in good 
shape.
If traveling with other vehicles, don't ride in their
dust clouds.
Alkali dust isn't all that bad for corrosion, as
witnessed by the many
rust-free Nevada vehicles.

Remember that you are really getting off the beaten
path in that 
region.
Never venture off alone unless you have reliable
communications
capability.  Cellphones often don't work.  Best to
travel with another
vehicle.  Most of Nevada is open range and it seems at
night that all 
the
cattle are black.  Consider the effect of hitting a
2000 pound cow with
your 3000 pound bus before turning a wheel after dark.
