Subject: Bus tranny fluid...

Howdy.

I am changing the tranny fluid in my Bus, and have a bit of a question
regarding exactly what tranny fluid to use.   While I have checked back in
the archives and the consensus is to use GL-4 85w-90, seems the only gear
lube I can find is GL-585w-90.  Have y'all ran into this?  My understanding
is the only difference is the GL5 is slipperier(?) due to an additive for
ltd slips.

Thanks
Gary
