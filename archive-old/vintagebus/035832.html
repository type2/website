i have always been told to put at least 92 octane fuel in aircooled motors
because it helps keep the valves cool from the low combustion rate. since
there is no lead to protect the valves. My question is what would a higher
octane (100, 110) protect it even more, or would it harm the engine in some
way? I know that you should nto jump down to a lower octane after using a
higher one, but can you jump to a higher one? There is a gas station right
by my house that has 100 and 110 racing fuel. they also have non-ethanol 92.
I put the 92 non-ethanol in my souped up gti. would it have any advantage in
a bus?
