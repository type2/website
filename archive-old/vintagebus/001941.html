This may seem like a weird question, but I have no point of reference and I
need your help.

I went to the gas station to fill up the bus after driving it around town
for the past 2 weeks to work (a 5 mile comute).   It took 8 gallons to go
just under 200 miles; that would be around 25MPG.  Is that good, bad or
sorta OK.  I have a 1500cc single port engine that I just rebuilt (the first
tank of gas to go thru the new engine) with a new carb.  This is a stock '67
with no whistles and bells.

I have never owned a type2 before, but I thought I would have had better
mileage (I suspect the fuel mixture is a bit rich but haven't had time to
make that adjustment yet).

Thanks in advance for your input
--Rich
