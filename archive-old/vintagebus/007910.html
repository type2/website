I was thinking about it for a few days and almost forgot. Thom, you said
that you paid so much money for the paint for your panel. I can see that you
should of just called Yellow Cab Co. and asked them for a can of their
paint. All you have to do now is to paint a checker board on the side and
you've got yourself a good &quot;working&quot; bus.
Just a suggestion,

Later,
