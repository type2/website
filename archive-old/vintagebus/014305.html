Cool, fun posts?  What list are *you* on?  It's been full-blown PMS
&quot;bitch about vendors&quot; week.  You were just in
the wrong place at the wrong time.

That wouldn't happend to be an early westy rack would it?

&gt; So because of a change of heart...I will offer BOTH items, yes I said both
&gt; items here on the list first.
&gt; I want $500 for the rack
&gt; I want $500 for the tent  (incl. orig. bag too)
&gt; Is everybody happy now?  
&gt; later
