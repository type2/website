Always be cautious when buying new heads, there are 5 different head
manufacturers that I know of in Brazil and Mexico, new duel port heads very
in price from 89.95 up to 125.00 a piece, there is only 1 VW authorized head
manufacturer in Brazil and 1 in Mexico, I have seen the cheap Brazilian
heads blow holes out next to the plugs due to thin casting and the cheap
Mexican heads with different CC's in each cylinder hole. Also the cheaper
heads use valves from Taiwan (even though assembled in Mexico or Brazil).  I
personally use Manley valves as they are excellent quality and made in the U
S A. Most of the valves you see in the rags are made in Israel. TRW valves
you really don't know what you are getting as they are just a repackager and
source their parts from the lowest bidder as long as it meets their specs
(kind of like wheel bearings ), I have received TRW parts, same boxes, same
parts, different countries of manufacturer (again the same as bearings). So
if you are going to buy new heads, look for the VW and/or Audi in the
casting as well as the vw part number and you will be assured at least a
decent head.
