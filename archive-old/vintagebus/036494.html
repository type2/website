Subject: re;[VB] ebay middle seat price is actually $450
Message-ID: &lt;80terh$5ft3_at_eGroups_dot_com&gt;

the seat on ebay is for sale because he bought an original seat
in excellent condition from doug delinger, probaly for less money'
if your looking for a middle seat and/or upolstery, contact delinger. 
a couple of my customers have bought seats from doug at what i think 
were very fair prices, he just seams to keep coming up with them!!




The middle seat owner just told me vai email it is reserved at $450, but
he might go $400.
I am tempted to bid it up to $399, just to piss him off.
I hate it when they start the bidding at ridiculously low numbbers
