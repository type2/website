In the few days that I have owned/been driving my new '60 DC, I have had a
number of satisfying reactions...

1.  A little boy in tow behind his mom stopped, stared, and pointed...he got
a beep from a 6-volt horn running on 12 volts, a wave and a grin....that
experience will lurk in his subconscious until he grows up into yet another
listmember....

2.  The insurance company called back in an effort to classify the
vehicle....they read from their list of recognizable VW's, and I told them
the closest was &quot;Transporter.&quot;  After  all, isn't that what these things do
best?  The space between the partition and the rear seat holds paper grocery
bags perfectly...

3.  Pat Winters, the driving force behind the California Bat Conservation
Fund, expressed real concern that my 40-year-old VW might not make it home
(I was collecting 2 bats for fostering until release this spring, so her
concern was that they get to the safety of our house soon)

4.  &quot;That thing is SO Gene&quot;  A quote from the daughter of the owner of the
property on which the studio that I work at resides.
Just a couple days ago, she couldn't picture anything that could take the
place of my 280Z as a car that fits my character.  I told her &quot;just wait,
and check this thing out&quot;, and I guess I was right!

5.  I saw some guy wave at me from the southbound 101 as I was heading
north....anybody?

6.  I am very happy.
