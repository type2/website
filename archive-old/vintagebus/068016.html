Subject: Re: [VB] Record Player? (fwd)

I mounted my CD player on an aluminum plate covered w/ the same carpet as the floor (top part of plate and around the front to the
CD player to save the paint under the dash tray), then the plate slips into the rolled bull nose of the underdash tray and goes back
to the bulkhead that the under dash tray attaches to. There is a hole (well 2 holes) back there and I used a fender washer w/ 1/4&quot;
bolt and a wing nut to secure it at the rear. solid as a rock and very quickly removeable......2 plugs and 1 wingnut _at_ about 15
seconds. No holes had to be cut. Just used existing ones.
