&lt;&lt; What would be the process for installing a case saver?&gt;&gt;
Hi Renoir,
First slide under you VW and see if your case was already case savered.  If 
no case savers you can go out and by a head stud with oversized threads with 
self tapping feature.  Make sure to buy the proper length stud needed.  If it 
is one of the lower head studs you probably can install it with the engine in 
the VW.  Since you drove around with a loose stud it probably is a good idea 
to take off that head and inspect the sealing surfaces of the head and 
cylinder.  You could have easily burned a hole through them.
  After you get the oversized stud started about three turns into the case 
material, back it out and clean off the self tapping hole in the stud and 
rethread back in.  Repeat this cleaning about every two to three turns of 
cutting.

  If you case was already case savered you will have to tear the engine down 
to a short block and have the hole drilled tapped and have a larger OD case 
saver installed.  You can replace the first case saver only about twice due 
to increasing size due to only so much room before interfering with the OD of 
the cylinder wall.

&lt;&lt;What if I pulled out the offending head bolt shaft, smeared it with JB 
weld, and stuck it back in? I wonder how long that would last? &gt;&gt;
About five minutes.    Eric&amp;Barb
