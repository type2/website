&gt; What is the best method of repainting the VW enblem onto the hubcaps


I freehanded mine, and it looks pretty good. You can tell that it was done
by hand if you get down on your hands and knees and look closely, but from a
distance it looks great. It takes a long time freehanding it, but then so
would masking it off.
