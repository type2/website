the rear passenger wheel to the front driver's window and an amazing

Diana,
You seem to be learning the valuable lessons that come with being a long time
bus owner.  I knew next to nothing about buses when I bought me &quot;74
Campmobile.  I was rather lucky to find such a beautiful bus for $500, but I
listened to a lot of bad advice, and paid a few mechanics a lot of money
before I learned to work on it myself.

I am now on my third engine rebuild, but with the help of this list, and my
Bentley manual, I now have a nice reliable bus.

You need to cut your losses and save up for a &quot;better&quot; bus.  You should by now
know what to look for, and by the description of what you now have, it would
not be difficult to find a bus in better shape.

Find a bus with a bad motor, and swap with the one you have now.  Save any
parts that you can and your old bus may live on in your new.

Good luck, and send us a pic of your bus.  It's a little hard to believe the
description.
