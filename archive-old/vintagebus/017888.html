I have collected a bunch of early westy info..I may be
able to help some...

&gt; I need information/parts to help restore my October
&gt; 1955 westfalia 
&gt; camper.
&gt; scheme, did westfalia use two toned rims or bumpers
&gt; on any of these? 
 
On the early westys pre'`59 so-23 change over stuff,
westys either came in factory colors such as Dove blue
ect...then sent to westfalia.  But You could also
purchase a Westfalia with custom colors.  This is seen
in the brochure you have listed on your web page.  The
facts are VW would send Westfalia a bus in all
primer...then Westfalia would paint it in one of their
crazy paint schemes.  Obviously the entire bus was
primer so then westfalia would also paint the front
cab interior, door panels and all over with the
mustard paint!  Looks really hoaky and fake if you
find one but it is 100% correct and westfalia done!! 
I have documentation and seen several buses like this.
 My old `57 Deluxe export was one of these...had the
paint code or primer only on the M codes too!  So if
yours is one of these!  DOn't paint over that stuff
its right!

&gt; Does anyone have a set of silver tent poles I can
&gt; check out? Are there 
&gt; any differences in the poles aside form color?

Little differences between the earliers and the post
`59s....the earlier was silver and the main support
poles are of smaller diameter then the later black
support poles.  Pre-`59 Tents are in radical colors
and did not have the changing room piece...tie downs
at the bottom were rope, not vinyl with stake holes
like later.

&gt; Were the rear cabinets bolted down or did they just
&gt; sit in place? 

Depends on the interior...the Camp Box was loose, the
Deluxe was bolted down.._dot_depends on what you got!

&gt; Anyone 
&gt; reproduce the original style laquer decals for the
&gt; interior? 

Some hoaky repops in Germany

&gt; Any ideas 
&gt; on curtain materials? 

Everyone piece of early lit I have had or seen has had
different fabrics,,,I think its your choice on this
one..remeber they only built 1000 westys between `51
and Jan `59!

&gt; Also interested in purchasing
&gt; any literature 
&gt; showing this color scheme.

I have that entire brochure you are showing on your
site...is that the interior you have also?
