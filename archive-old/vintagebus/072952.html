Subject: Re: [VB] Steam Clean an Engine?

What are the benefits of cleaning &quot;all the carbon build up off the valves
and pistons&quot;? 
        AND.. can it actually cause/reveal problems that the carbon is
currently
helping/hiding?
--------------------- Clip ------------------
I routinely run a quart of Marvel Mystery Oil in my crankcase for about
300 miles before and oil change and 16 oz in the fuel tank for this 300
miles.
With this procedure you can pull your engine apart after many years of
operation and complete all the cleaning of parts with very little effort.
Carbon makes valves run hotter, pistons run hotter.
Carbon build under your piston rings and binds them, often making your
engine an oil burner.
Sludge and varnish inside the engine make it run hotter and dirties your
oil sooner.
All that greasy build up on your engine outer surface makes your engine
run hotter and will harbor enough oil to give you eternal little oil
drips.
Greasy, oily build up in your engine bay is a fuel for a fire if you ever
have a fuel leak that ignites.
A good general rule is that cleaner is better in almost all situations.
