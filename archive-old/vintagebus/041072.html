I am not sure what was used, the receipt doesn't say. When I bought the Bus
I found the receipt and asked the PO of 16 years if the motor had only
23,000 miles on it. He laughed and said that the bus it's self had over
600,000 miles on it and the motor in it now had over 100,000. Comparing the
mileage on the receipt, adding a 100k and the 46,000 miles that I have put
on it as a daily driver, I came up with this number. Hell it could be more
than that on it for all I know.
The cost to rebuild the motor and install it 8 years ago was $1100.00. So I
think decent stuff was used but defiantly not top of the line for that
price.
When I replace the motor this summer I plan on keeping it intact for a
spare, I would be afraid to crack the case and see what makes her tick. Ya
see I am more of a tune-up person and not a rebuild type of guy.

Tell us all about the motor that has gone 168,000 mi.
Who built and all the specs Please
Ronnie is now running a 1776 sp
P &amp; C
59 ddr w/t w 65 ez camper thinking about a motor

 I checked the archives and did not find anything on 1776
&gt; single port motors, what is the consensus on this? currently I have a 1600
&gt; in the bus with a freeway flyer and reduction boxes. The motor it's self
&gt; still runs strong after 168,000 miles on it's current rebuild (has between
&gt; (138 to 141 in all 4 cylinders),
