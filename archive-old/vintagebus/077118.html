&gt; HC in PPM - high rpm  :    MAX  500   my bus - 60      at idle :  MAX
&gt; 500  my bus 852
&gt;
&gt; CO in %   -  high rpm    :  MAX  4.20  my bus  - .26    at idle :
&gt; MAX 5.5    my bus  .20

Sounds like a rich idle condition or else a misfire.

If it's a rich idle, all you need to do is lean it out, perhaps 50RPM on
the lean side of idle.  Run the idle speed as high as you can get away
with, say 975RPM

If it's a misfire, put in fresh plugs.
