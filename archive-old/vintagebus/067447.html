Subject: Re: [VB] Ebay?

It's really dicey trying to buy a car on ebay.  It can be done, but you have
to be very careful.  You might try to find someone on the list that lives
close by and have them check it out.  It's so easy to get screwed, and you're
just standing there waiting for the seller to say &quot;hey, you're shoe's untied&quot;

If you're asking here how to tell if it's relyable [sic] then you have a lot
more due diligence to perform before you are ready.

&gt; Hey, my name is Nate. Im 18 and I really am into VW buses. I found a great 
&gt; bus on ebay and the guy says it runs perfectly. How sure can I be that he is 
&gt; relyable? It looks too good to be true but I have to drive to Virginia to get 
&gt; it (Im in PA) What if I get it home and its all messed up? I really want it 
&gt; but Im not sure.... give me your imput.
