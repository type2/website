well there you go a warranty for stuff on ebay, i wonder how these guys sell
the craftsman stuff so cheap on ebay?

and at the same time you see these guys selling &quot;vw 36m axle nut sockets&quot;
and getting bid up to 15 -20$ for a cheap chinese socket you can get at the
flaps for  5 bucks, hehe

btw, 3 other good sources are pawn shops, flea markets, and estate sales,
you have to hunt these a little , but its fun,

&gt; No, I've returned all kinds of stuff.  You just walk in with the broken
one and
&gt; its parts, and you walk out with a new one or a remanufactured one
(rebuilt)
&gt;
&gt; &gt; ther is always several craftsman vendors on ebay selling sockets ,
wrenches,
&gt; &gt; etc , really cheap,  do you have to have a reciept for the craftsman
&gt; &gt; warranty for sears???
