Hey, Gang, I'm Corn-fused????  Is there one or two Bus Meets on June 12th at
Irvine, Ca???
I've heard reference to a new club-OCTO??  and also to SOTO. Are both having
a meet?  Where? and When?  Thanks for any help, I'm coming down for the
Classic and want to make a full week-end of it.  Getting excited, :&gt;)
Paul
