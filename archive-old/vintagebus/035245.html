ps; it's a 1960 DD empty camper with 195/14 NanKing 6 ply tires, almost

40,000 miles on them and still have tread left, but will be due for a change

by the next show season.


pps. I forgot to mention 3.88r/p  77 4th big nut reduction boxes


- - - - ---  -
what i have in my 65 westy is a 3.88 r/p .82 4th with big nuts.    
goes 40mph at 2k rpms, 50mph at 2.5K,  60 at 3K, 70 at 3.5K in 4th.   
extending this out, I would go 100mph at 5K.   but I have not done that.   
Also has those hill problems, as I am running a 1600.  In flat areas (like 
Az) I did not have hill problems.

would be interested in how yours tachs out, in 3rd not just 4th, just to see 
if it is the same as my bus  (though I am not sure what my 3rd gear is)
