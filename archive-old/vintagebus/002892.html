Hey Robert,

Don't bang your head too hard against the wall.
You'll get there.

All this anticipation will just make your bus all the better when you
finally do show up.  Sure, you'll be able to point out all the flaws but
those who judge will probably not be able to point to something of theirs as
better.

Chin up!


So, where is Familienfest?  :-)


David
