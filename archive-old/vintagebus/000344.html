&lt;&lt; Would over torqueing the (Front axle) nut cause this hot hub? &gt;&gt;
Hi Tom,
This can even cause the bearing to weld itself to the axle!  Had a friend do 
this, which caused him spending two days waiting for a VW repair shop to open 
in N. Cal.  Best to tighten the axle nut down till you feel it snug up on the 
bearings.  Then loosen about 1/8-1/6 of a turn.    Eric&amp;Barb
