I do rust repair and fab for a living..don't buy a cheap brand welder 
unless you like frustration!the major problem with the inexpensive 
welders(like:century. cambell housfield,harbor freight) is the wire 
feed drives slip or break so you get a lot of stuck wire to the tip 
and uneven welds.also you will be pissed if you need a part and 
home depo tells you 2-3 weeks!..do yourslves a favor and buy either 
a lincoln 
sp 100-130(I would go with the 115-130 with variable heat control 
rather than the 4 or 5 position control)or a miller 130 model(i have 
not used the small miller but it is a quality name!)..I have a miller 
squarewave tig and miller 250 wirefeed..but the welder that I have 
that gets the most use is my little lincoln 115  the only way to go 
for body work or sheet metal and if something breaks the local 
welding supply store will likely have it in stock or at least know what 
i'm talking about!and it you buy from the little guy welding shop they 
will remember you next time you come in and will likely be able to 
help you with welding advise! definatelly stay away for fluxcore 
welders they really suck!
