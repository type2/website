[trip report part 2]

The rally organisers' mechanic, Eric van Rensburg, and his wife Brenda took
us into their home and Eric gave me a corner of his workshop to work in.
Eric runs an air-cooled repair and tune-up business from his home, while
Brenda works in admin at Weiss Volkswagen, a Durban VW dealer and a sponsor
of the rally. Weiss is that extremely rare creature, a VW dealer with an
interest in air-cooled VWs.

The next day, Sunday 2 July, I pulled the engine, and began the stripdown.
The sump plate was a mess of white metal chunks, a very nasty sight. The
heads were apparently undamaged, even though the spark plugs and barrels
were blued from the heat. After the heads were off we found number four
piston badly burnt on its bottom edge, while the others all still looked
shiny new. Once the barrels were off it was clear that the engine was indeed
seized on the crank. Number four small end bearing was also seized. At that
stage I packed up all the bits and discussed my options with Eric. He could
put me in touch with folks who could supply me with a used engine, and he
also said that Weiss VW had a factory rebuilt 1600 single port engine in
stock that had been ordered before the Beetle rally but not installed in one
of the two Type 182 Kubels that Weiss entered in the rally.

Since there was no guarantee that a used engine would get us back 600km to
Jo'burg we decided to go with the rebuild, even though I have a very low
opinion of the local VW factory rebuilds, having suffered several nasty
failures with them in the past. But Eric swears by them and seemed surprised
to hear of the hassles I'd had with them.

So I got the factory rebuilt unit, and thanks to Brenda's word, they let me
pay it off over three months, and didn't charge a deposit for the core, as I
didn't want to give them the cooked engine because it contained my CW crank
and I still wanted the guy who built it to see it. Then followed two days of
work, removing the SP heads from the rebuilt engine and fitting the
undamaged DP heads from the cooked motor. I also dismantled the speedo and
lubed it up so it wouldn't snap the repaired cable again, and called in an
auto electrician to sort out the remaining electrical problems. He got the
warning lights working and showed me that I had been inadvertently running
the bus without a regulator, since the alternator is of the external
regulator type. Between that and the bush mechanic's alt wiring, it's a
wonder we didn't trash alternator and battery as well as the engine. Oh, and
he also made a neat fix for the crusty main fuse connectors -- he connected
a spade connector and short piece of cable to each of the main fuse
connections, and then fitted a Ford-type fuse to to the ends with two more
spade connectors. Instant cure for overheating main fuse and a must-do for
most old buses.

Anyway, I learnt a lesson not to head out on a long journey in a newly
rebuilt bus that hasn't been properly ironed out. But at least we also
proved that you can completely renovate a bus in five weeks if you have the
will.

Once the bus was running again, we considered our options. One possibility
was to rejoin the rally in an unofficial capacity, but we dropped that one
pretty quickly. I wasn't about to rush anywhere with a new engine and blow
that as well. So we chose instead to spend our remaining leave time visiting
friends and relatives and doing some hiking in the Drakensberg mountains,
after which we thought we'd make a slow trip back home to Johannesburg.

So we loaded up the bus and took our leave of Eric and Brenda and chugged
inland, not exceeding 60km/h for the first leg of the trip, which was only
about 50km to Hillcrest, where B's friends Barbara and Kenny stay in a
rambling old stone farmhouse with 360-degree views from a commanding
position at the top of a high hill. Very cool people. The Zebra Bus
reawakened old memories for Barbara and she entertained us with tales of the
many crazy solo trips she made in an old VW bus in her youth. Kenny, a
master carpenter and cabinetmaker,  has an appreciation for old machinery
and showed me his 1952 Vincent Black Shadow. The Vincent is a 1000cc V-twin
British motorcycle of such outstanding engineering and design that it makes
a Hog look like a traction engine.

We spent a couple of days with Barbara and Kenny before firing up the Zebra
Bus again and heading another 50km further inland via back roads at 70km/h
to Pietermaritzburg, where we spent another couple of days with my cousin
Ingrid and visiting other friends around Maritzburg.

Then we headed off again, still chugging along at 70km/h, into the
Drakensberg mountains for a week of hiking. We were planning on heading home
after our time in the mountains, but then changed our minds and opted
instead to return to Durban for the Beetle Rally prizegiving dinner and to
hear all the stories about what we'd missed.

By the time we returned to Maritzburg we had covered 1 000km on the new
engine so I gave it its first service. There were chunks of white metal in
the oil so I checked crank end float, to find a noticeable knocking when I
pulled back and forth on the pulley. Hardly surprising, as the engine was
supplied with a 0.5mm oversize pulley boss, suggesting the case had been
align bored pretty wide ... Burned again by a Volkswagen factory rebuild.

Just as we headed out of Maritzburg I stopped by an interesting-looking car
parts shop operating out of an old lock-up garage. I found this guy selling
a treasure trove of used tools and obsolete NOS parts. Bought a good, used
46mm socket and asked if he had any VW parts or literature. I ended up
buying four NOS Type1 camshafts (PN 113 109 015D and 113 109 021D), as well
as two NOS Italian-made 34HP fuel pumps, all for less than the equivalent of
US$70.

Then we headed for Durban, driving flat out (100km/h) on the freeway on a
warm windy day. When we reached Durbs I stopped and checked the engine temp
(dipstick test), but it was running very cool despite being pushed hard.
Next we pushed a little way up the coast north of Durban to Umdloti beach,
where B's father had arranged for us to stay the weekend in a beachfront
flat. Ahh, the lap of luxury after 10 days living in the Zebra Bus. Our bed
in the bus was very comfortable, but several nights up in the mountains it
was so cold we awoke in the mornings with the condensation frozen inside the
bus.

All the Beetle Rally folk were surprised and pleased to see us at the
closing dinner, and we enjoyed the slide shows and story-telling and
prizegiving. Of the original 10 starters, there were five finishers. Two
other engines blew, and one Beetle was rolled in Botswana.

Then before dawn the next morning we loaded up and headed inland, making for
Jo'burg by the back roads in freezing weather. As we passed the Drakensberg
we saw it had snowed overnight in the mountains, and enjoyed crisp views of
snow-capped peaks which we had climbed in warmth the previous week. We had
to dress warmly in the drafty, unheated Zebra Bus, but the new engine loved
the cold and sang sweetly at top speed all the way home.

After a nine-and-a-half hour journey untroubled by any mechanical problems,
we arrived back home in Johannesburg. We had cooked a very expensive new
engine and missed the Beetle Rally, but we hadn't let it get us down and had
still managed to enjoy two weeks of touring in the Zebra Bus.

When we got to Jo'burg the new engine had developed a flat spot and had
become very difficult to start. A tune-up revealed that ALL of the valve
gaps had closed up. I reset them and the engine ran sweetly once more. I
hope valves or seats weren't damaged by the overheating???

First order of proceedings back in Jo'burg was to call my engine builder. He
was surprisingly conciliatory and agreed that the engine failure was
probably due to a tight bearing or a blocked oilway, and in either case that
would be his liability. He has the engine in his possession now and will
hopefully strip it on Monday so we can assess the full damage and discuss
the terms of his building a replacement engine. I'll keep the list posted.

And as for the over-bored end-floaty factory rebuild, I reported my findings
to the parts counter man at Weiss Volkswagen and he got on to the factory.
Their tech chief reckoned white metal in the oil is something they are
liable for, but suggested that end float on the crank has something to do
with a worn clutch pressure plate. I got his number so I could speak to him
myself, but he was unavailable and hasn't yet returned my call. I'll keep
the list posted on that one too.

Next year's Africa Beetle Rally has been set down for April, and the
organisers have decided to reduce the distance to 4 000km, as this year's
rally was too tough. I have been involved in planning next year's route,
which will be entirely inside South Africa. But with some of the stretches
I've included, the shorter rally will still be a driving challenge as well
as a fantastic way to tour the country. Maybe there'll be some listees on
next year's event? Check out www.beetlerally_dot_com for details of how to enter
as an international team.

Enjoy those ACVWs!
