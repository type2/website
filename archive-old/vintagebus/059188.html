&gt;Subject: Hare-brained heater scheme???
&gt;Date: Tue, 26 Mar 2002 10:51:06 -0500
&gt;
&gt;I have gotten a line on a couple of 6V South Wind gas heaters and 
&gt;my tentative plan is to make a self-contained heating system. 
&gt;Basically I would build a &quot;box&quot; that contained the heater unit,
&gt;a 6 volt (or 12 depending on the heater) battery, and possibly
&gt;even an independent small gas holding tank.

Put the gas tank outside the passenger compartment.  I know this
makes &quot;self-contained&quot; harder but it is basic safety.  Also make
sure the box is fastened down some way so it can't come loose in
an accident or even under hard braking.

&gt;The box would be vented on both ends to allow for heat circulation 
&gt;and re-circulation,

You also need to think about getting combustion air to the heater.

&gt;The box would have a seat cushion on top to be used as an extra seat

Try it without the cushion first to see how hot the top gets.

&gt;If I use a 12 volt heater, I would probably just tap into the bus' 
&gt;electrical for power, but it looks like I will have only 6 volt
&gt;heaters, in which case the 6 volt battery would have to be pulled
&gt;out and re-charged as needed.

I think Rick Taylor posted recently that the South Wind 6V heaters can
easily be made to run on 12V by wiring both blowers in series instead
of in parallel.  You could wire the blowers to a terminal strip with
jumpers for easy voltage changes, or if you're really into it, wire
up a switch.  If you use a battery in the box, wire a connector on
the outside of the box to the battery and put a matching connector on
your battery charger, so you don't have to disassemble the box to
charge the battery.
