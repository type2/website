Just did my valve adjustment for the first time the instructions I had only 
had one spec .006&quot; for all the valves. Is there only one spec or do the 
intake and exhaust have different specs?

I'm trying to get my engine temp down  and someone suggested retarding the 
timeing. I can't find a code anywhere on this engine. I've had the local 
guru look too. Anyway specs are different for different engines. I'm pretty 
sure it's a 1600 I know it is DP, It has an alternator, and someone put a 
vapor system in on the tank so I think it is early 70's but that still 
doesn't tell me if it is a  HI, HO, BI,  Can anyone offer advice or point 
towards a resource. I'm in the sticks here so I can't just run out and check 
out 25 books on the subject.

thanks,
Scott
