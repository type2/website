Subject: Re: [VB] Difference in Engine Lid Lock 66/67

What it seems had happened, the latch on my decklid came from something else
(who knows what).   When I went to order one they showed 66 and 67 being
different numbers. What I've since been told that the difference is 2 bolts
verses 3 bolts.

Anyone have one for sale?

&gt;
&gt;
&gt; &gt; there is a dif engine lid latch for 66 than 67.  I thought it had to do
with
&gt; &gt; having 2 vs three screws, but Im not sure.  some 67 freak should know?.
the
&gt; &gt; apron is the same, though, so there is a slight change in the lid
between
&gt; &gt; 66/67.
&gt;
&gt; I have a 66 and a 67. My 67 lid was bent beyond repair so I put an extra
66 lid
&gt; on it. I used the 67 lock, it works fine. The only difference I noticed
between
&gt; the 2 years was the license light. 66 has the bulb socket attached to the
lens.
&gt; 67 had a separate lens and the socket mounted in the lid about 4&quot; away.
Both
&gt; 67's I have/had were like this.
