hel all,
my bus has some pretty beat turn covers and ive been thinking about what to 
do... leave em, find good one$, or get some repops. i got the new VW Trends 
yesterday and on page 13 see some repops from WCM which dont look too bad in 
the 1/4&quot; black and white picture. anyone have 'em. im worried about the 
shiny part just rubbing off in a week or so.
thanks,

Bob Margiotti
