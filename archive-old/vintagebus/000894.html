Hello Everyone

	The splash pans I have are mount on top of the bumper brackets. They have a
small hole in the center of the bracket on top. I got lucky I was in Las
Vegas and called around to some junk yards and the only place that had some
busses was out by the raceway in Vegas. I found the splash pans steering box
splash pan and a 67 windshield washer bottle. I Just thought I would let you
know.
