Subject: Have Gauges, Will Question

After a hot weekend of futzing around in and under my '67 Deluxe, I have
a temporary installation of three new VDO gauges.  

To the person who asked about routing the stock CHT wiring harness
without splicing it, I put the sensor on #3 plug, ran the thermocouple
wire through the firewall so the plug is in front of the firewall (FIF).
 I routed all the wires through the left frame similar to the stock
harness in the right frame.  No, I don't have a permanent route forward
of there, but the wires provided made it to the parcel tray without
splicing.

However, after my 40 mile drive to work in 90 degree weather, this is
what the gauges are indicating:

1) CHT:  Generally about 350 degrees.  Found that it pushes 375 or so at
sustained 50-60 mph on flat land.  Certainly cools off at slower speeds
or cruising at 40-45 mph.  Several archive posts push the 350 number
around.  They weren't clear about mounting (whether spark plug or head
stud).

2) Voltmeter:  Pops right up to a bit about 12 volt when I turn on the
key.  I wired it to the windshield wiper switch (after the light switch
and after the ignition switch and after the fuse, so I figured it is
about as far away from the battery as I could get).  The harness is
about 6 years old.  Battery the same.

When I start the engine, the gauge goes up to about 15 volts and pretty
much stays there.  I take it my voltage regulator is not properly
regulating?  Haven't fried anything, but I take it the extra voltage may
boil my battery water away if I don't do something about this.  I have a
couple extra regulators, may swap them to see if it makes a difference.

3) Oil Pressure:  I'd had my oil light coming on a lot at idle, so I was
mostly concerned about this.  Bought the sender with G/WK (Gauge/idiot
light) terminals, set at 6 psi for the idiot light.  My hope that my
original sender was bad was misplaced.  It still goes on.  Oil pressure
drops off not only at idle, but at low rpm (like 45 mph in 4th gear when
decelerating).  Runs at about 20 psi at 50-60 mph.

The engine setup is pretty stock, 1600, single port, stock cooling tin
(type 1 oil cooler) all in place.  Good engine seal rubber.  New case
with c/w crank, new rods, pistons/cylinders, heads---all rebuilt less
than 1,000 miles ago.  The case is dual relief from Bernie Bergman.  Had
to scrounge to get the extra spring/plunger since all I had before was
single relief cases.  Oil pump is a question.  I know I bought a new
one, just can't remember if I had it to install when I rebuilt the
engine.   Also, stock vacuum distributor set at 7 degrees BTDC.  Really
idles poorly there, it really wants to be advanced to 10 degrees.

OK.  Enough questions.  I know there are several gurus out there who can
provide some insight.

I'm working on a mold to make a clean dash/parcel tray gauge
installation that can be for one or more VDO gauges out of fiberglass. 
No holes in the dash, etc.  Once I get it worked out to my satisfaction,
I'll provide some photos.

Any guidance appreciated.
