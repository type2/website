I think way too many people see the AIRS list as just something to be used
when you &quot;break down&quot;.

I am of the thinking that it now needs to be more than this.  Not only an
entity that offers assistance for &quot;break downs&quot; but also offers sanctuary to
the traveling VW driver.

America is a fine and beautiful place, but there are dangers.  The only ones
that can combat these dangers are the ones that promote good as admoately as
the bad promote and perpetuate bad.  Don't forsake your own safety, but
don't deny others safety either.

Wade is the Web CZAR for AIRS.  It is up to him what goes on the page, but I
would really like to entertain this issue and discuss a &quot;host member camping
list&quot; for even travelers who aren't having problems with their busses.

Fellowship is stated in the AIRS charter.  I saw what fellowship the
listserv members can offer when I was traveling around the country trying to
find the beginning of wind.  AIRS was started because of my travels, your
actions, and when Steve Dolan was traveling on his last journey.

I can blow more hot air than most and am certainly not the best person in
the world, but I will assure you I mean for AIRS to be a good thing.  My
actions will show it more now than ever before because of these recent
developments.

Other groups charge dues for membership.  AIRS will never do that as long as
I have say so in it's purpose and direction.  AIRS is simply about service
to our fellow human beings that drive our vehicles.  Bus, Beetle, Ghia, or
jetta is welcomed anytime in my yard.  Hell I might even offer the same help
to a chevy owner, who knows?

I am not the best person in the world, but I do try hard.  That is what AIRS
was built on. It's about being a part of the solution, more than the
problem.

Whatta ya say Wade?  Do we make a list of &quot;Campsite Driveways&quot; or simply
state it more strongly in the FAQ?

Are any of you interested in signing in on that separate site?

Is it necessary?  

Mail your response to me personally at cjford_at_altamaha_dot_net.

On another note:

I would like to suggest that we place a dedication to Kristen Laurite on the
A.I.R.S. site.  She deserves it if anyone does.  We helped her all we could
and I truly don't see how we could have done anymore.

I wish I could have been there for her in the end, but some things have to
happen the way they happen.  We learn from the tragedy and try to be
proactive so they don't happen again.

Thanks for tolerating my benevolent ramblings.  I am trying to work all this
out with myself right now.  Please bear with me.
