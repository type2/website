Subject: Flywheel Weight?

What does a stock 200mm flywheel weigh?

I rebuilt my stock 1600 with a SCAT counterweighted crank, didn't order
a new flywheel.  Instead I took my stock flywheel to a local &quot;precision&quot;
machining shop to have four more dowel holes drilled to match the SCAT
crank. First, they bored holes so large the wheel moves on the dowels. 
Second, they didn't recognize that one of the dowels is spaced
differently.  

I pulled one dowel from the crank and I'm running the flywheel as is,
but I want to pick up a new one to match my crank.  The SCAT Enterprises
web page lists a flywheel to match, but lists it at 12.5 lbs.  I grabbed
a spare flywheel from my stash and weighed it, but just on a household
scale.  Looks to be 15-16 lbs.  That right?

Where can I get a standard weight flywheel to match the SCAT 8-dowel
configuration?
