Precisely why I'm considering doing a TDI conversion in a T3 as my next daily driver.

Even though it would be impossible to do, if there was a nationwide fuel buyer's strike, we could
stop this ludicrous gluttony!  FYI, again: Yes, I'm up to date on the details, and my opinion is
absolutely unbiased!

There are not enough adjectives in the English language to describe how I feel about this. 
Suffice to say, &quot;It is beschissen!&quot;  But that's just my unhumble opinion.

&gt; by regional company representatives to get ready for the possibility of
&gt; $3-a-gallon gasoline this summer.
