Subject: Re: [VB] stuck drum update

looking at the eastwood tool again it says &quot;not to be used as a pulling
tool&quot; I guess it's not strong enough. In the bently manual on page V-4, 1
it shows the proper tool. What are my chances of finding something like
that? (not good thinks I)  Is there a Hazet tool or similar tool like it
that is well made. Is John &quot;hazetguy&quot; still around?
