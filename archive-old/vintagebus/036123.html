 Hi Kelly,
 Actually started from chassi number 1 080 104, which is about sometime in 
 MAR63 in the late 1962 model year.  Does anyone have a bus right around this 
 time, and how close?     Eric&amp;Barb

Eric&amp; Barb- I think that 1 080 104 chassis is teh first bus with the innie 
engine louvers,  check  a bit further back to july 62 # 971 550 for the wheel 
well change
