Subject: Cooling Questions

Hey all,

I picked up a thermostat and bracket at the Pomona swap today.    BTW
while looking for said thermostat, I couldn't believe how many people
had no idea that VWs even had them...one guy wanted to argue with me
about their existence, of course his VW history consisted of cutting up
nice clean cars and making Baja's out of them.  I just walked away.

The thermostat didn't have the actuator rod with it.  Can I get one of
these through any supplier (Bus Depot, etc.) ?  I also noticed (when I
got home) that I need the vanes for my dog house shroud.  Are all vanes
the same (with respect to post 36hp motors)?  The bellows are stamped
65-70, I assume this is Celsius.  Is this the correct temp range for a
1600-1641?  If not, or not functioning, can I get these new?

Lastly, are type 4 coolers available new?  What should new ones
run...old ones?   Thanks for any help?
