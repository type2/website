Subject: Re: [VB] Investment bus

The only good deals on ebay are the ones that are mis-listed, like
calling it a volswagen, or calling a tilt and bows a &quot;bed liner&quot;
---------------------- Clip -----------------------
I'm not going to knock anyones Ebayze offering but since the bus offered
is missing lots of seating and interior parts ; in general is just a
shell ................ I think I'd wait for the whole bus to come along
if I were in the 'I gotta Have One Mood'.
Personally I'd like to have one of those but I gotta' get it cheap.
