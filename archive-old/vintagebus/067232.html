Subject: Re: [VB] Front end Q's

The guy I bought most of my used VW spares in Christchurch, New Zealand, 
Robin Randall, told me that the accident that wrecked vw steering boxes 
was hitting curbs hard.  You'd hit the curb and the steering wheel would 
snap spin out of your hands.  This action cause a chip in the steering 
worm.  Robin was a factory trained VW kiwi.  He saved my ass many times 
selling me needed parts.  Of course the &quot;problem&quot; there was that post 
'67 vw parts were so rare and expensive.  Older ones cheap and common!  
I got a beautiful, perfect, rhd steering box for my '66 westy for only 
$30 US.  I still have the bad one if anyone is interested....   Gary
