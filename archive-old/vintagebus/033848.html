you have to have of the early both cables to adjust them- and usually they 
dont need adjusting.  Guess it felt like it when there was one cable there!!! 
 THose ch 500 xxx and earlier brakes cables were getting expensive when one 
snapped on me 10 years ago-  it was $35 for a new one.  ouch

What state do you live in that inspects the parking brake et al to get your 
tags?

&lt;&lt; I tried my best to get my emergency brake working right today. 
 Problem is that there is only one cable in place. And the threaded 
 area at the end of that cable is all bent to hell from it being the 
 only one. So when I try to adjust it interferes with everything 
 around it. So I guess I'm just gonna order 2 cables and re-do the 
 whole thing. I'll be calling you tommarrow Ronnie...see if you have 
 'em in stock.
 
 That means no-go on driving to work tommarrow and getting inspection 
sticker:(
