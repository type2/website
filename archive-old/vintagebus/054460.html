&gt; I went to the local VW guru. Had brakes redone. Back brake piston came out

&gt; and said that I didn't have enough a## to take the nut off because he really
&gt; torques them down.
&gt;
&gt; I drove (sans brakes) to nearest shop with impact wrench. It could not get
&gt; it off! Said go find 1/2&quot; impact because his only was rated for 650 ft-lb!

&quot;rated at&quot; and &quot;produces&quot; are two different things!  The impact gun was
probably one that is good for lug nuts.

&gt; Took it back to guru to replace brakes which he did. He was convinced it was
&gt; not adjustment, but something else. He spent time checking lines from MC
&gt; back to hub. Nothing.

Sounds to me like the &quot;guru&quot; made sure you came back to him by
overtorquing your hub.

&gt; I have the bus back now. Whew!
&gt;
&gt; I am concerned that I can't get the hubs off with standard equipment (I
&gt; tried jumping on a breaker bar!)

That should be enough for a freshly-installed nut.  If it is on there a
while it can get rusted and be a real bear to remove.
