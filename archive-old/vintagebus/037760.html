I have a guy that has made a  towbar for my bus.  It is made  of 2inch pipe and is configured so that it mounts where the bumper does. (yes, you have to remove the bumper first)  We haven't negotiated cost yet but it will be a very attractive price.  What is nice is that you get a truly secure  fit, with no chance of messing up a several hundred dollar restored bumper.  Let me know if there is an interest and I will get some pics.
