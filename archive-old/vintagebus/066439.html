 I would do a FULL tune up, drain all fluids, including brake, change any
gaskets on the engine you can get to, fuel pump, dizzy before they really
start leaking, so on so on

&gt;you drove *that* bus on the interstate!!! BE CAREFUL!! how are the brakes?

Yep...the bus sat from 1984-2002 and the prev owner got it road ready. The 
brakes are perfect, much better than my 71 Westy that has a bad brake 
booster



&gt;many things could cause the lack of power, if it hasnt run in a while... 
&gt;start with the ignition (distributor, plugs, wires)... or an early whacko 
&gt;small nut mountain tranny like in my bus :-)

Would this be a reason to move to a 009 Dizzy? Also, I'm going to be 
changing the plugs, it has the same ones in there for the past 20 years.
