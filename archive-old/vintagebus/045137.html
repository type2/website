&gt;  When I took the taillight out I saw that there are two red and white wires
&gt;  spliced together for a common female plug. There is also a striped black 
and
&gt;  white wire plus a wire that leads to the license plate light fixture. There
&gt;  are two prongs and a ground prong sticking out from the taillight housing.
&gt;  The way it's wired now, when I turn on the turn signal all the lights in 
the
&gt;  back blink very slightly. What am I doing wrong???

use the ground on the taillight housing.  run a wire from that ground spade 
to the body of the bus- as it is the pass side you could ground it where the 
battery ground strap attaches.    Otherwise a weak ground the lights will 
ground through each others circuit.  

you could also test this by using a grounded test light- is that brighter 
than the bulb holders-

the red/white is taillight/liscence plate light,

the black/white is brake signal/turnsignal
