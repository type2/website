Hi Matt,
For those who have the 1962 and earlier buses with uncut rear wheel wells in 
the rear this is true for the rear axle.  For 1955-67 (And probably for the 
barndoors also.) the biggest radial tire you can fit on the front axle, on a 
15&quot; rim is the 205/75R15.  For the 1963-67 bus one can install up to 
235/75R15 in the rear wheel wells.   Eric&amp;Barb
