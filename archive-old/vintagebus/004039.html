Clara,

I still have your pop can heater gap covers...I wonder how much they'll be
worth in a few?  That extra knob is still under the driver's seat....I am
waiting for inspiration to strike as to what to do with it!

The spare wheel well was cut sorta lopsided, so I dove in there with my saw
and harvested the flap that was left.  That nice piece of sheet metal is
destined to become the replacement for the areas that are rotting on either
side of the engine compartment (behind where the decklid seal goes)
&gt; -----------
&gt; that bus used to have a american brand  (south wind?)gas heater in it-
think
&gt; I had put pop cans or something to block off the engine to inside gap  (?)
&gt; is the extra knob still on the bulkhead under the drivers seat?   see the
&gt; mounting and exhaust holes in the left side of engine compartment.  had
&gt; another 66 westy that had the exact same deal.  seems they cut the spare
&gt; wheel well to fit the heater.
&gt; ........................
&gt;
&gt;  I have to thank the person what welded in the replacement battery pan!
Good
&gt;  job!
&gt;  ------------------

In addition to the wheel wells and rocker rot, both of which were in the
logbook (I can't get to it...it's been masked off), the driver's side front
floor, at least the outer part of the cargo floor, the cargo floor behind
the driver's seat, and sections of the nose in the lower right and left
corners were replaced.  I am now charged with the mission of keeping it all
from rusting again!
I plan to remove the mechanicals from the underside and sandblast when we
get back from wherever we end up going this fall...but this will be after
the shiny paint!  Does this make sense?  Well, in the name of getting back
on the road, I forsake efficiency!


Gene
&gt; was that in the little log book?  I seem to think it might be mike, who
also
&gt; replaced the wheel wells and some rocker rot.
