I've made 5 tilts in the past year, 3 Single Cab and 2 Double Cab.  I've used OEM hardware on all 5.  To make a tilt that matches the originals is not a small feat.  This is not to say it can't be done, but it is a very involved process.  Probably the biggest hurdle in making your own tilt is having access to the proper equipment, i.e. sewing machines, etc.  Industrial grade equipment is necessary, primarily due to the thickness of the correct duct canvas.  The other need for proper equipment is to have double stitchers for a lot of the hems.

The main reason I've stopped making them is I ran out of OEM hardware.  I believe PLF sells the hardware, so if you can buy enough hardware for your tilt I'll make it for you.  Trust me the tilts I've made are as close to original as anyone can make.  The hardware thru PLF runs about $125 for a DC and $140 for a SC, I think.  I can provide the canvas, webbing, plastic window and make the thing for approx. $500, either size.  It's not much cheaper but every $125 helps.  The thing to keep in mind is that the repop tilts, at least mine and PLF (I've never seen Greg's) are not just a piece of canvas cut and hemmed and slapped together.  There is a lot of work that goes into making one right.

Just like the saying, &quot;You get what you pay for.&quot;
