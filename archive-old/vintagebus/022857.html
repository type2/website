Having just gone thru this twice in the last year...

I used a gallon and a half of dove blue Omni on the '55, and just about 2
gallons of the Mellow Yellow on the panel.  This included the cab and
engine compartment.  You wanna get 4 or 5 cans of rattle-can made up, too.

&gt;Hey guys---
&gt;My 1959 Panel is almost ready for paint and I was wondering how much paint 
&gt;will I need for it for the outside and the cab? cargo area? The outside and 
&gt;cab will be Sealing Wax Red and the cargo area will be grey? I really don't 
&gt;want to run out and have to go for a new mix (extra paint is fine)!
