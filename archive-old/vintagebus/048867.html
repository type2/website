Subject: Greyhound shipping

Hi all-

FYI, I just had a positive experience shipping parts with Greyhound.

Shipped a full rear seat, pedastal and pickup bed wood slats from KY 
to San Diego.  Not sure when they actually arrived, but on the fourth 
day the parts where here in San Diego.  Total cost was about $67.00.

I was impressed.

Dave
