&gt; The record turns at a constant angular velocity, so the further you are
&gt; from the pivot the faster the record surface moves under the needle.  The
&gt; record is recorded to compensate for this.  Vinyl Killer moves at a
&gt; constant speed so the music seems to speed up as it approaches the center
&gt; of the record.
