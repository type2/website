found them from qualitygermanautoparts_dot_com, does anyone have experiences

Hi Al,
Try calling Butch at Bear's VW machine (619) 691-8385.  A 1641cc SP with new 
unleaded heads, counter wieght 69mm crank, and new engine case is $1,300.00 
with core trade in, $1,400.00 without trade in and shippingfrom SanDiego to 
Seattle is $125.00.  We have over 50,000 miles on the same type of engine we 
got from them and it is still strong, smooth and quiet.  Please do tell him 
that Eric&amp;Barb said &quot;H!&quot;.   Eric&amp;Barb
