Subject: roof rack repair

I need to splice in several tubing sections in my roof
rack.  My plan is to cut out the damaged tubing and
insert a section of new tubing of suitable size, in
this case 11/16 OD, and drill across this assembly for
#10 bolts.  I plan to leave 3 inches on each side of
the joint.  My questions:  1) is there a better
method?  2) what about drilling a hole in the outside
tube only and plug welding to the inner tubing. 
Thanks for any suggestions.
