Subject: Dash Point camping &amp; Puyallup Springmeet report!

Hi Volks,
We got up at 0800 Saturday morning to pack the last camping things up in 
Nermal, our 1960 panel camper conversion.  It took about an hour or so to 
drive in the wet overcast from Olympia to Dash Point park.  Arrived toasty 
from the huge amont of heat Nermal was putting out despite the 50ishF 
weather.  The sky slowly, but surely got lighter and lighter with less and 
less rain fall.  Eric's sister Kimera &amp; nephew Maxx with their 1969 Canadian 
panel camper conversion were waiting for us at Dash Point.  They had gotten 
there earlier and picked out a pair of camping spots for our two buses. 

 We proceeded to take a hiking trail down from the camping area to the beach. 
 Lots of trees, brush and spring flowers.  The trail, which for the most part 
follows a small stream, was well made.  Though some areas were steep and 
muddy/slippery.  Passed under a high bridge that the local auto traffic uses 
and shortly afterward we were on the beach.  The tide was going out and the 
four of us enjoyed walking up and down the beach picking up small pink clam 
shells, sand dollars, interesting rocks, beach glass, and seeing water 
occassionally shoot several feet out of clam holes in the sand that carpeted 
the beach.  We all too soon returned to the camping area by taking the other 
route up a steep winding road back to the camping area. 

 There, Eric&amp;Barb picked up a fishing pole and gear and returned to the beach 
about noon, whilst Kimra&amp;Maxx took a nap.  Back down at the beach E&amp;B found 
the tide all the way out exposing over 400' of beach!  Eric tried fishing 
with some worms found on our walks flushed out by the rainy weather.  Barb 
had fun finding sand dollars smaller than dimes and alot more sea shells.  
There were some flocks of ducks we had never seen before with beautiful 
patterned chocolate brown and contrasting white feathers.    The cloud cover 
was beginning to break up giving a dark and sunny contrast to the surrounding 
view.  Several white colored pleasure craft out in the water became almost 
neon with the growing/changing sunlight.  Finally we turned back to climb up 
back to the camping area and conferred with Kimera&amp;Maxx about getting food 
and dry firewood since the local deadwood was soaked.  We all piled into 
Nermal and drove out about 3 miles back the way we came in.  Found a Trader 
Joe's for sour dough bread, smoked motzsorella cheese, smoked gouda cheese, 
and the brand of cheetos they sell.  Also found a Safeway to buy fish and 
three Duraflames logs, which came in handy later!
  Back to camp.  The spot next to us had a group of about six Canadians from 
Vancouver BC area that had driven down in their Concept and a 1970ish Blue 
Westie.  On the other side of us was John &amp; Judy and their Vanagon with 
Subaru engine conversion.  One of the Canadians came over with a 72-79 bus 
clock with cool inner dial for timer clock to turn on for gas heater in the 
great white so the owner could get up in the moring to a toasty bus to drive 
to work in!  The crystal of this clock was broken and had some water damage 
from sitting in a wrecking yard bus.  Unfortunately we have not yet gotten 
into repairing the later quartz clocks so all we could do is supply tech info 
on how to remove the bezel holding on the broken glass so it could be 
replaced.  We offered to trade a standard accessory bus quartz clock for it, 
but he was not interested!
  After this visit we foraged for dead wood and John&amp;Judy came over to visit. 
 They had come down from Mt. Vernon in their Vanagon for just part of 
Saturday before heading back North to Mt. Vernon due to John needing to work 
Sunday for PACCAR!  Slavedrivers!  John&amp;Judy lent us their hatchet to cut 
some wood down to size for our fire and we started a Duraflame log.  This 
turned out quite well because we could stack wet wood over one Duraflame log 
at a time in the fire pit and this dried the wet wood enough to get quite a 
blaze going.  We also set up our propane BBQ and put on the marinated chicken 
we had started the day before.  Eric's sister Kimera put on some fish she had 
bought and the feasting soon began!  The clouds finally relented in the early 
afternoon and sunny skies ruled.
  After feasting and doing some minor repair work on Kimra's 69 camper, we 
went back down to the beach at 7PM to find the tide all the way back in and 
only about 30' of beach.  Eric fished his quota of seaweed, but no fish and 
we enjoyed the setting sun and warm rays from it.  
  Back up the road again we hiked to the camping area, where we enjoyed the 
fire with lots of coals and talking about stuff till 9ishPM when it got dark 
and we all got to bed.
  Got up at 515AM to load our swap stuff from the front seats of Nermal to 
his cargo area and off we went to the Puyallup meet with Kimera&amp;Maxx 
following.  It was twilight and a light fog was here and there as we drove 
out of the camp ground.  Arrived after a 40 minute drive at the back gate for 
swappers at about 615AM.  Drove in and hand carried our stuff into the 
building and parked Nermal outside of the fairgrounds.  All swap spaces 
inside were filled soon and they even had swappers outside which is risky 
this time of year due to our usually rainy spring season. 

 Bob&amp;Nimfa Herr sold on our right side and it turned out later that both 
Clara Williams and Susan Dolvin had tried to get swap spots near us, but due 
to SNAFUs ended up several hallways away.  Fortunately the sun ruled the sky 
all day and we had one of our warmest meets there.  Eric found some good 
stuff for later resale, but no OG items.  We got to visit with many old and 
new VW friends.  John&amp;Rachel showed up while Eric was out hunting parts and 
startled Barb.  Rachel had found a 55-58 front bus bumper for $20.00 and had 
it slung over her shoulder like a big game hunter carrying a rifle!

  Kimera&amp;Maxx bought a tie die T-shirt and a good used heater cable to 
replace the broken one in their 69 camper conversion.  They headed out about 
2PM for their home.  We sold a good amount and Eric did not buy too much to 
put us back in the hole.  We packed up at 3:30PM and got Nermal in, packed 
and out of the fairgrounds about 4:30PM.  We led Bob&amp;Nimfa in their Chevy to 
a DQ in S. Tacoma to relax and enjoy some eats.  Turned out the DQ had just 
opened that day after major renovation and had all ice cream and shake 
machines go down in flames that morning!  So we had Dilly bars instead.  Then 
we headed South to our place to pass out from sore feet and throats from 
talking so much!

Barb's 2 cents extra.  Quit hassling with the fairgrounds.  We tried it last 
year.  Nasty people, no toilets, wanting lots of money for no services, 
making it obvious all us &quot;VeeWee-ers&quot; are nothing but a pain to them.  She'll 
never try to stay overnight there again!  Dash Point was nice, fun, close, so 
lazy and relaxing!  Yes, $16.00 per night, but you get real bathrooms, 
showers, fire pits, beach, space, peace and quiet with trees all around.  
Well worth it!
Eric&amp;Barb
