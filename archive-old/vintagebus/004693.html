Hi Guys,

My daily driver, '55 Single cab is not feeling so well.  The tranny has been
popping out of second for the last year or so, and this weekend I think I
finally broke her. I had gone surfing and had to pull into some soft sand to
park, upon leaving in reverse I lost traction. A friend helped me by pushing
on the front of the truck as I reversed. No probs getting out of the soft
sand, but afterwards while sitting at idle in neutral the truck began to
vibrate pretty badly around the engine. Hard to tell if the engine was
vibrating or the tranny.  Driving her home I experienced the same vibration
at stop lights, but not while driving.  Just before I pulled into the
driveway, I could smell a something burning... A quick check revealed a
smoking generator! Weird?  Could the generator have caused the vibrations
around the engine?  The gen light has been coming on occasionally, but
usually it goes off within a few minutes of driving.  Has anyone ever heard
of a generator wearing out where it would get extremely hot and vibrate the
engine?  In the past when gens have gone out on me, the light has just come
on and stopped charging the battery...no smoke, grinding, or whirling sound
as this one has.
Thanks :-)

-Tom
