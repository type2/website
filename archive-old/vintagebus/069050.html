There is one place where this isn't the case:  Tools that you loan.

I have a box full of cheap wrenches that I bought at garage sales.  If a
neighbor or fellow traveler wants to borrow a wrench they are welcome to
look in the box.  That way there are no hard feelings if the tool doesn't
find its way back.
