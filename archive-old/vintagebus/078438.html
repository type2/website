Subject: Re: [VB] bus runs again

Glad you got it going! 
I drove from the central valley (red bluff?  willows?)  to oly w/ a 5 gallon 
gas can as a tank once. ... it was an emergency situation.

If you take the reserve switch off the bus, does gas fall out?  You may want 
to siphon out most of the gas first, and keep any electric light bulbs away :) 
 I got a WolfsburgWest reserve switch rebuild kit and it worked great.  still 
works, put it &amp; a new filter sock in the bus a few years ago.   

Oh, sometimes the metal line and the fuel hose clog up.  if you pull the hose 
off the bottom of the tank does gas fall out?

I just hope you're not continuing to drive with this setup!

Have fun cleaning and fixing... I had a good time with my fuel tap
project.  A good time to get under the bus and learn a bit more.  Block
it up nicely and start crawling  :-)
