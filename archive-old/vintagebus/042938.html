Hey everybody,
I was in a fairly serious roll-over accident last night. o oNo one
got
seriously injured except Floyd, my '57 Standard.  I was driving by myself
and was rounding a corner at about 60mph and decided that would be the
perfect time to look down at my CD collection to pick a different one to
listen to.  Well, next thing I knew I was in the gravel on the shoulder
and ended up over-correcting, and somehow slid on the driver's side for
about 50 feet and then rolled over onto the roof for another 50 before
slamming tail first into a concrete guard rail thingy.  Thank God the
barrier was there or I would have sailed down a steep embankment.  After
the bus came to a stop (and after all the band equiptment came to a stop)
I undid my lap belt and crawled out the busted out front windshield.  All
I suffered from the crash was a couple of cuts and a tweeked left
shoulder.  The worst thing about this wreck is that it was all my fault
and could have been avoided, and another old bus is totaled :(  I was
REALLY looking forword to painting him     him
soon, but now Floyds dead.  Sorry
old boy......see ya on the other side.

:( Adam &quot;Beefcake&quot; Bruno ):
