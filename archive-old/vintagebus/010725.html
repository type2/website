&gt;  Since I've just begun my conversion of an all original 65 Camper into a
&gt;  rolling shell, anyone have their favorite order in which to dissassemble,
&gt;  repair/replace, then reassemble?  I've already cleaned out ppo's personal
&gt;  effects (slippers, shoe polish, taco bell hot sauce, electric bills, etc.),
&gt;  removed most of the camper interior and floor.  My goal is to turn the bus
&gt;  inside out, and do a respectable resto.  Here's where it's at:
&gt;  
&gt;  Had been sitting 1 1/2 years?
&gt;  Running, rough, loud
&gt;  Can just barely find first and reverse
&gt;  Driver's window rot along bottom seal (1/4&quot;holes)
&gt;  Rockers shot
&gt;  Driver's dogleg bad
&gt;  Rear wheels toe in
&gt;  absolutely no brakes
&gt;  Super solid frame
&gt;  Straight as an arrow
&gt;  All electrical working
&gt;  
&gt;  If I fixed the brakes, I could probably drive it around a bit.  I only
&gt;  started it to get it off the trailer and into my garage.  I'm in no rush
&gt;  whatsoever because it is my fifth car, and I was supposed to &quot;stop&quot; after
&gt;  the fourth, so I'm glad just to have it at all.  I'm working on a website 
to
&gt;  show pics of progress, and my goal is to eventually give the bus the same
&gt;  feeling of pride it had when it went on it's first camping trip way back
&gt;  when.  Possible thread starter:  pro's and con's of putting safari's and
&gt;  deluxe trim on it eventually :)?
&gt;  

definately start with brakes. (including new flex hoses)
clean engine compartment,  drain engine oil pull motor, replace main/oil 
cooler seals,  gas line, engine to body seal, tranny boots, change gear oil 
(in RGBs too), check oid gear oil for tea leaf reading (coppery sheen to old 
oil, large chunks?)
check shift coupler- maybe replace front bushing
new engine oil, tune up motor,  reinstall it,   check for exhaust leaks

but that's just me- and my 61 is ratty looking.    I go on the if you dive 
too deep at once you'll lose interest theory.  

oh, dont forget to polish  the dash.  and I live in WA state, so I am big on 
new windsheild seal with roofing tar.   I think deluxes trim is silly on non 
deluxes, and safaris are extremely groovy unless you want the windsheilds to 
keep the water out- being dry climate and covered parking, unless you use it 
as a summer rig and /or swap windsheilds for the winter (like me)
