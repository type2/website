Subject: Re: [VB] Rarest of the Rare?

I have seen Sundials, Riverias and EZ's but never a
Westfalia. Where you at the Dillons beach campout?
There was a DD camper there that was pretty cool.

65 Westfalia

&gt; &gt;  As I sit here (working hard) I was struck with a
&gt; &gt; question: Has anyone ever seen a Westfalia with
&gt; either
&gt; &gt; a sliding door or double doors? I would guess that
&gt; if
&gt; &gt; they do exist, they would be pretty rare or I am
&gt; just
&gt; &gt; hitting the wrong shows!

&gt; I have a '65 DD EZ camper, another local VW guy has
&gt; a '60 DD EZ and I
&gt; think VW Howard had one as well. I know it's not a
&gt; Westy, but still a
&gt; camper.
