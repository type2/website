&gt;still hooked up, doesn't work of course, but i want to know if its fried
&gt;now. dont know how to test it. looks cool though in the uncut dash, so i


I would disconnect the radio and then apply power direct to it so as to make
sure you don't have a problem in the fuseblock or elsewhere.  If it won't
come on, it's probably fried.  A trick that I learned in school was that
sometimes, in well-built electronics, there is a diode that protects the
rest of the radio from being burnt to a crisp should it be hooked up
backwards.  The diode simply fries and is located real close to where the
main power lead for the radio hits the motherboard.  I fried a CB radio once
and held on to it for several years until I learned in class what I had
done.  I got lucky and replaced the monstor diode with 2 smaller ones
soldered in parallel.  Radio worked like a charm after that.

So maybe in your Sapphire's past, someone reversed polarity and fried a
diode - *IF* Sapphire built their stuff well.
