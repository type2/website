Subject: Crew cab rear seat question

Hi-

I have discovered that there are evidently two different types of 
pedestals for the rear seats in crew cabs.  One type is of uniform 
height around the surface that meets with the seat cushion, and the 
other is notched down in the front about an inch or so.  Also, the 
notched seat appears to have the mounting brackets inside the 
pedestal, while the other has them outside.

I have a '67 crew....clues to which is correct?

TIA

Dave
