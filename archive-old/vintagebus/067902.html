&gt; The record turns at a constant angular velocity, so the further you are

&gt; of the record.

Exactly sir
Constant angular velocity as opposed to
Constant linear velocity
CLV/CAV like the 2 flavors of laser disks.

BTW cds are CLV so the disc spins slower the farther out it gets.
and cds play from the inside out. slower and slower.....
