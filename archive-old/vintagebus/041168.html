Subject: Re: [VB] new to chicago area



&gt; It's definetly slim pickins here in Chicago for ACVWs.
&gt;  &gt;
&gt; Chicago is pretty weak in the VW scene, probably due
&gt; to the rust factor and not too many have survived the
&gt; salt.  &gt; &gt;

I would have to disagree !
Maybe not that many in Chicago proper, but in Cook County ,I can think of
dozens and dozens into acVw's., and 20 to 30 into air cooled
buses.Several of them are in Chicago.

Paul, you are due to come to a dbg &quot;event&quot;, just a thought :-)
