Subject: vw trends, sept 2000 issue
Date: Tue, 25 Jul 2000 10:04:14 -0700
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

thanks to two good friends, i've been alerted to the fact that my single cab
is pictured in the september 2000 issue of vw trends in the coverage of
kelley park.  this morning i picked an issue up while coming to work; i was
late but i felt it was justified.  on page 93 next to a beetle with a rack,
my blue single cab lounges on the grass.  my buddy bill is standing at the
driver's door and it looks like i'm storing some loot or picking up food.
(those flesh-colored things sure look like my legs.)  i'll fondly remember
that i was asked by two of the show volunteers if i wanted to show or not.
i asked the second person if she thought my truck looked like a show car.
she had to admit that it did not.

cheers,
