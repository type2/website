Subject: grab bar ends?
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

Hi list. Happy Who-lidays as the co-branding post
office says.

Does anyone know of a souce for '67 era dash grab
handle ends? 

That is, the ends only.

You know, those oval flanges which cleanly seat each
end of the grab handle to the dash. They are made of a
harder plastic and usually crack.

I need ones for a deluxe. Repop okay. Ivory or
beige/grey. Or are they chrome?

I've been trying to mold some out of resin from the
one good one I have, but they just look about 5
percent funky.
