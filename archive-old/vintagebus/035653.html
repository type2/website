I used PPG paint on my 65 westy, and am very happy with the quality of the 
paint.  Still looks great 2 years later without wet sanding or buffing or 
polishing or any of that stuff.   

I have seen a bus painted turquoise/blue white PPG and the turquoise seemed a 
very nice colour match to me.

My bus is velvet green/blue white.   do be aware, PPG formula mixes the 
bluewhite too green, turns out kind of minty white  (it really is a 
greenwhite) and you need more white tipped in.  I had the paint on, saw what 
happened, went back and got it remixed, the PPG guys were really really nice 
about it, as they understand that customers want their vehicles to come out a 
certain colour.  Stare at your original paint.  WHen you get it mixed, bring 
in a suitably large piece of bus painted the original colour which you have 
cleaned and polished to check against.  Maybe an air vent cover?   At least 
you can get an idea.  Colours will start spinning through your head.  This 
was over two years ago and I still stare at velvet green buses to figure the 
colour, and think I finally have a real understanding of velvet green     I 
had a flashback of this the other day at the Red Barn before Kelley Park 
looking at a velvet green westy, and lo and behold when The engine lid was 
lifted the colour inside was lighter than the colour outside, and yes the 
inside was so like my lighter green on the outside of my bus.  Look at your 
colours.    I think turquoise/blue white is a gorgeous combination.  realise 
that over the last nearly 40 years the paint fades and ages, sun and air and 
weather do these wierd thing to it.   

the wheels and bumpers were painted Silver White.   

used tin foil around the wiring under the dash to keep the paint off it.  
Much easier to plug it all back together when it is still colour coded.
