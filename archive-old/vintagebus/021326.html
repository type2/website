I didn't expect such foot pedal support .   I thought people would point and
laugh, hey that's cool  :)  

just doing some mindless tinkering today.       I may even sell my  59 truck,
which has it's good sides and bad sides.  Yes I have too many buses, but
whatever, I can accept that, but money helps support my habit.  But I like the
truck.  But I got a pretty decent offer on it.  hm..   hard to find a nice
one.   It's pretty nice.    I could find a nicer one.  But I really like that
year, want a split case tranny bus.  I could just drive the barndoor around
more.  when it's not rainy.  ha ha .        Well, I'll have to haul abunch o
stuff in it to the dump this weekend.

Taking apart front brakes on the 67 kombi (FS).   It pulled violently to the
right.   Turned out the cylinders were bad on that side, and the shoes all
gooed up and crudded.  You know how they kind get pit in them?   So I replace
dthe cylinders and shoes on that side and cleaned and regreased the wheel
bearing  and was greasing the suspension and a tree fell across the road just
south of my house, so I couldn't go to town.   (one one way).  Well, there's
worse things.   Left side tomorrow.   

So why don't the lights work?    This was cool.    The running lights and
taillights works, but not the actual headlights.    After and checking the
left headlight (worked fine with the battery charger), tracing the wires on my
battered and somewhat greasy copy of a colour wiring diagram (66/67) I decided
to start from point A, the headlight switch.    Yes, the switch gives power
out when pulled out all the way.    (made test light, I keep losing them)
Pull kick panel,  thick wire goes to a 4 prong relay, with  wires coming out
to the high beam/low beam circuits.    No juice would come out of either
circuit no matter what.  I pulled it out, tested again with battery charger
and test light.   Pulled out my box of relays, found another with the same
part number (311 something, 12V) tested that one, it gives power out.
Installed it  (check to make sure things plug in right) and suddenly the
headlights work.  That was too easy.      How about turn signals?  None-
wiggle some connections on the 9 prong relay.   Now why doe sthe left side wrk
but not the right or  emergency lights?    Wiggle and clean connections,
rapidly flipp the stalk back and forth, they work.  Corrosion?  nah.
couldn't be.   Okay, why doesn't the oil dashlight work?  Traced it to a bad
sender, replaced the sender.  Light works.  Too cool.   I like electrics.
The point it it is all colour coded.   Plug green/black wire into prong
labeled VR (as in Vor Rechts, or front right) etc.   Plug white/black wired
into plug labeled VL.   connections clean?    throw out any wrong coloured
wires  installed by a DPO in a pile on the floor (be dramatic, especially if
you are doing this for smeone and they are watching- more entertainment)
plug the right ones in , or replace the bad ones with corrrect colour wires
out of the wiring harness you snagged out of that junk 72 superbeetle in the
junkyard that you paid $2 for.   

It is so organised.    A working of art.
