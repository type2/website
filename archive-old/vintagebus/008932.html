Subject: cigarette lighter?

I bought a 66 deluxe a while back and noticed a cigarette lighter in the
dash next to the ashtray. I just assumed it was a hack by a PO. The knob is
just like the other factory ones on the dash. While looking at Dan Howards
57 pics I noticed he mentions an accessory cig. lighter, but as far as I can
tell it's mounted a little lower. Could this be a dealer or possibly a
factory option? Maybe I need to pull it out and put it on Ebay before I take
it to Rick Taylor! This could be a $300 item! Just kidding Rick!
