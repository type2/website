Susan-
The trick to the splash pans is to figgure out which
side they go on. Its pretty much bolt on from there.
The easiest way to do this is to remove your rear
bumper and brackets from the bus. ie, remove the whole
assembly. Then lay out one pan at a time in the
corners of the bumper. The splash pans bolt to the
side of the bumper, the side of the bus and to the
bumper bracket. It's easy to tell which side is which
by how the pan attaches to the bumper bracket. There
is an indentation on the pan that fits snug on the
bracket. Pick up some metric bolts at the hardware
store and secure them snug. Let me know if you need
pictures, for I currently have my bumper off.
