Subject: Turning engine pulley in 4th gear to determine transaxle gearing?
Date: Tue, 25 Jan 2000 13:29:19 -0800
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

Ronnie said that once he talked to the guys at Rancho and they mentioned
that they get customers all the time wanting to know their current R&amp;P and
4th gear.

Basically Ronnie said that you:
  1.  put in 4th.  Jack up rear wheels.
  2.  You have to hold one side of the rear wheel to make the other side
turn.
  3.  Mark the wheel you are measuring.
  4.  Turn the crank pulley x number of turns.
  5.  Record where the wheel turned (?)
  6.  You can then calculate the R&amp;P and 4th gear with some formula?

Anyone know the details of this procedure?
