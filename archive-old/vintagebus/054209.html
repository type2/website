Subject: I'm Bushed, well re-bushed anyway!

Well,
After about 6 greasy hours under the '66, I have finally got new center pivot (swing lever) pin and bushings.  Thanks for all the advice on reaming, I ended up getting a brake hone from Sears for 9.99 and it did the trick just fine! I now see a great improvement in my handling! And I thought that all vintage buses just steered funky!  Anyway, next thing I am gonna do is replace that pesky 009 dizzy with a stock vacuum (please see next post!)



Peace, John Baker
