Subject: spraying water into =?iso-8859-1?q?carb=3F=3F=3F?=

Hi. A friend of mine has a low mileage but sitting for a while engine.
It currently runs, but smokes a LOT, and goes through a quart of oil  
every 200 miles, has oily plugs, etc. Clearly the rings are stuck. We 
have tried running Marvel Mystery Oil in the oil and gas, but to no   
avail. Basically, as the engine only has ~65k miles on it, and is all 
original, he really doesn't want to rebuild.                          
  He told me that he heard you can start the engine, and get the rpm's
up, and then pour a tiny bit of water into the carb as it's running.  
The water will turn into steam, explode in the cylinders, and jar     
loose the rings. I was told this also works for stuck valves and such.
                                                                      
  Anyway, I wanted to see if anyone else had done this, as it seems   
pretty risky. Any thoughts, advice, warnings, etc? Thanks,
