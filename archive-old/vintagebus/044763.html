Subject: bumper bracket + panel cargo area color 
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

Hey guys--
I'm getting a list together of parts and their color for my bus and have a 
few questions! 
BTW---It's a 59' panel (Sealing Wax Red)

What color are the bumper brackets supposed to be? black?
Also, I know the cargo are is usually grey primer, but, I'd like to use a 
high quality primer grey auto grade paint----Do you guys know a paint code? I 
also need to paint my cab divider(thanx Eric and Barb)--should I use the 
cargo area color or a color matching my WW door panels up front?

Thanks alot---
Pete
'59 panel
'74 super vert
 

Any other easily missed items to make sure I have on the list?
