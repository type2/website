&gt; I have heard that the cargo floor peices that DBH sells do NOT have the
&gt; reinforced strike plate for the cargo door vertical rods nor other seat
&gt; mounting plates.  I have heard that WW's floors do have these plates.  Is this
&gt; correct?  I got this info from another lister (chunks!), and just want to see
&gt; if things have changed :)

I checked out the &quot;outer ten inches of the cargo floor&quot; sheetmetal I
bought from WW a few years ago(before I learned about Das Bulli Haus).
It is made in Brazil and does have &quot;reinforced strike plate for the
cargo door vertical rods and seat mounting plates&quot;  a little crude but
they are there.  The striker plate is very thin on the outside area
------=-=------ where the vertical rods go through.

The seat mounting plate has the two holes for the brackets that look
like an old style key hole but is missing two other round holes my bus
had in the middle of the bracket ('67 21 window Deluxe).

Hope this helps.
