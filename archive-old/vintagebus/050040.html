Subject: Oil pump question

Is there an easy way to tell if an oil pump is intended for a 5/71 and up
engine (with the so-called 'dished' camshaft)?  I have an oil pump with
filter I want to install on my '74 type one engine, but I'd like to know if
it's the correct pump before I tear into this job.

TIA,

Kabayo
