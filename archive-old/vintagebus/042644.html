hi jim,

i am pretty sure the 34 pict has different models available, as i had a 34
pict and it rubbed on my alternator when i made the conversion from gen.
on my 71 bus.  i just bent stuff to make it fit.  I think i bent the
accelarator pump thingy toward the centerline of the engine, and maybe
ground on it a bit.  i left my brand spankin new alternator alone and
fiddled my old worn out carb.

There is an alternator 34 and a generator 34.  The BOCAR 34 pict is an
alternator model and is designed with a different style of acc pump
linkage. and should clear with no grinding.

I think that FI and alternators started about the same time here in the
US, so that would explain why almost all used carbs are the generator
style.

Personally, i have a bocar carb and havent had a lick of trouble with it.
It was such an easy install, i'll probably go new again if i need another
carb. (30 pict 1 with an adaptor plate on a 1600 dp, i like the way it
runs.  No 34 pict stumble and the smaller venturi adds torque, the adaptor
offsets it away from the gen.  You have to use a new bocar to do this as
the german carbs acc pump linkage gets in teh way of the adaptor.  I
think next time i'll go with the 34 pict and vac dizzy though, a bocar.)

peas,

Steve

p.s. the only problem i have heard of with the bocars is freeze plugs
popping out, but that can be prevented with a chisel and about 5 minutes.
Stake that puppy in.  if it comes out reinstall with red loctite.  Thats
what i was told...YMMV...
