Subject: Re: [VB] SHIFTER QUESTIONS

I just had my bus rebuilt. The whole thing. All new bushings in the shift 
linkage and the trans has about 1800 miles on it. The shifting is tight. The 
feel on the shifter is a little bit of stiffness. Once it breaks in, I 
expect the shifter will feel almost loose.

Once broken in, if you hold the shifter in loosely your hand in neutral and 
flop it left and right, it will be very smooth and easy. Not much friction, 
but no slop. Could be that your mechanic is right and everything is just 
lined right up. My bus before rebuild shifted very easily. Could slide it 
into 1st at 15mph without reving the engine. Hope that helps.

Don't forget to safety wire the bolts on the long shift rod under your bus. 
That should help to keep things tight. Even if the bolts loosen a little, 
they will only turn a fraction of a revolution and not fall out.

&gt;A month ago the linkage in my bus fell apart and it wasn't the first time.

&gt;felt something familiar.  Something was in backwards.  I could EASILY find
