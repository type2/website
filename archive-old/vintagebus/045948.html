I don't understand how this post has anything to do with a 2nd generation 
repairman.

I haven't had any horror stories, except when I bought my first car, a 73 
westy, the engine was crap and died in a few week due to internal 
hemmoraging.   Being 16 and it was so cool inside and a BUS, I didn't really 
pay attention to the motor, it seemed to drive, but I should have paid a 
mechanic to look at it.

but you are looking for a list of things to look at when buying a bus?

&lt;&lt; Being a bit removed from the novice, wondering what horror stories you
 have on the purchase of the Volkswagen.  Something you forgot to look
 for, that little old lady bamboosled you?  
 
 Putting together a what to look for to save a bunch of time and trouble. 
 Have it mostly finished but now need a bit of input for things might
 have missed, maybe a natural thing to the expert and unthought of by the
 novice.  Please reply to derottohaus_at_aol_dot_com of this address.  
 
 Thanks in advance.  Page to go up soon.
