Subject: roof rack clamps

On one of my roof racks, I was missing two clamps. There was a fellow
here in Calif who made exact replicas. I don't know if he's still doing
them or not. There has been no mention of himofrom other listees so I
presume he is no longer making them. Anyway, On another rack I was
missing one clamp. My local blacksmith made a perfect replica.
Bob, in northern Calif.
