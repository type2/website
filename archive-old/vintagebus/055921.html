Subject: VW tool 241a

Hi All,

I went out to the garage tonight to remove the transaxle on my quest to
narrow the axles 3/4&quot; on the double cab
(http://www.dsquared-dev_dot_com/davem/narrowrear.htm)  I'm using parts of a
Wolfgang rear lowering kit.  Anyway, I had semi pressed the rear axle
bearings in place so I could roll the dc down to the paint shop for some
minor touch ups and when I went to pull the axle tubes off, I realized that
the rear bearing race is a reasonable press fit onto the axle.  I got the
outer bearing race free from the axle tube bearing housing but I can't get
the bearing to slide off the axle.  When I opened up my type 1 manual, they
show using a VW 241a tool to pull the bearing off.  I have a puller kit but
none of the arms have hooks that can fit inside the bearing and get a good
grip on it.  I guess I could order something but I had some time reserved at
the machine shop to get things done and I would rather not have to wait....

Any suggestions on how to get the rear axle bearings off the axle???


David
