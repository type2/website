Subject: Was Bus Engines, Now More Cooling

&gt;&gt;If you increase displacement and power,

I've noticed even my stock 1600, single port, is going over 350 degrees
CHT on #3 plug and I am for the first time in 30+ years of air cooled VW
driving considering an external oil cooler.  Even on the plains of
Illinois at highway speeds the temperature is too high for my comfort.  

I see Bus Boys has several kits, from $81 to $127, and though I always
disliked second guessing VW engineering, I'm seriously considering this
mod.

Certainly, I would not be mounting the cooler inside the engine
compartment.  Kinda defeats the purpose.  Martha Stewart accessories
aside, I don't want scoops on the side (or coolers either).  I
understand that a location on the underside is preferred by some.

Any recommendations on external oil coolers sources or locations for
mounting?
