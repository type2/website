Subject: RE: [VB] case studs too short

Craig, I was just over at North West Connecting Rod today getting another case
saver replaced and noticed he had block 4715 sitting on the floor for a
customer. I told him about the main case stud length issue so he bolted it
back together. Sure enough, it has the same problem. When I am finished die
grinding out my case and take it back for the wash, I will have him face off
the case stud holes a little deeper, probably 3/32&quot;, about the washer
thickness.
