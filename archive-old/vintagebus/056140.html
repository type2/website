Subject: Re: [VB] Relays

Here is the wiring of the 12V equiv of the 6V Emergency relay for a 65 and
earier bus.

Terminal #                             bus wire color

30                                           Black with blue stripe
86                                           Gray
87b                                         Black with white stripe
87                                           Black with green stripe
85                                           Ground (no wire exists on 6V
version)

All wires but ground are a direct plug-in to the 12V relay. You have to make
your own ground connection to the body on this relay. On the 6V relay, the
ground was made through the clip on the top that attached the relay to a
boss on the body.

&gt; &gt; Sure. I'll do a diagram and post a URL for it. Give me a day or so to
get
&gt; it
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; done.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Thanks Steve,
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Do you happen to know the wiring of it off hand?
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; There is a 12V equiv., I have one on my '65 DC and the 4 way flashers
do
&gt; &gt; &gt; work with it. You have to order it directly from a Bosch distributor.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; The Bosch part # is 0332 015 001. I bought it from Julianna Co,
&gt; &gt; &gt; 800-334-0476.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; It mounts a bit differently from the 6V equiv. The 6V piece grounds
thru
&gt; &gt; the
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; cap via a clip that mounts to a hole in a boss under the dash. The new
&gt; &gt; piece
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; has a separate connector on the circuit board for the ground. Just run
a
&gt; &gt; &gt; jumper from this lug to ground.
