[regarding rear torsion bars]
&gt; Actually, the Bentley says the L/R orientation is irrelevant.

My Bentley (for bays, but the torsion bar design is the same on splittys)
has a statement that reads:

---------------------------
CAUTION:
Torsion bars are prestressed in their working direction.  If both rear
torsion bars have been removed you must be careful not to interchange them
from one side of the vehicle to the other.  The left bar has an L on its
outer face; the right bar has an R.  [italic] If the bars are installed on
the wrong side, they will break when placed in service.[end italic]
---------------------------

I don't have the splitty Bentley, but a similar warning is carried in the
'66-'69 bug Bentley.

They seem pretty definite about it!
