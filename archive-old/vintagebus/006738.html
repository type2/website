yes correct, and the chrome ones are plated locally in Cali. pricey but much
better then china chrome, I have a repop at a chrome shop here in Havasu
(parker) just to see how they do and the cost. I also have a billet
prototype (large VW bus emblem) that I had made by a guy who makes the
billet alt pulleys and other billet show and go goodies (no interest to the
vintagebus crowd) that I also have.

I'll post some photo's of the emblem soon (billet)

as far as I can figure there are 2 or 3 supplers

#1  roundboxtools_dot_com  does theres in China

#2  West coast Metric and most of the other LA- Orange County guys get them 
from the same guy who makes them here in LA.....

#3???  the third one I am not sure of, might come from the same China guys 
but is not the LA one.........I never looked at the roundboxtools_dot_com  and 
the third one next to each other......
