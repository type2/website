&gt; I just bought a 59 panel,with an excellent rust free Texas body .The rear
&gt; end has been taken apart. It has the torsion bar and tube in place,but is
&gt; missing the spring plates,covers,transaxle,etc...
&gt;   I have access to parts busses (56,61,65) with all necessary parts. What I
&gt; don't know is :
&gt; 
&gt; 1.   Which year(s) of spring plates will fit my bar and tube, and which of
&gt; these will work best in my application?

Any 55-67 bits.  Doesn't really matter.  I'd say use the nicest bits you can find.

&gt; 2.  Apparently a big nut tranny will fit,but what if any mods will be
&gt; required to make it fit and shift correctly.

It will shift fine; it's the ebrake that will require engineering.

&gt; 3.  Should I use 14&quot; or 15&quot; stock wheels,as I have both.   Advantages?

15&quot; - better highway speeds
