Happy Friday to all!
I just HAVE to tell all of the people who are instrumental in keeping
this mailing list going what a terrific job you do.
What brought this on you might ask?  Let me tell you, you don't know
what a GREAT list we have until you experience another REALLY BAD
list. I have experienced this over the past couple of weeks as my
husband joined a list for Stealth/3000 GT owners thinking he'd have as
much fun as I do on this list, and OH MY GAWD is there a bunch of CR*P
going on there! They have no moderator so ANYTHING GOES! All week they
have been debating Iraq and for at least three weeks have been on the
same topic of how to unsubscribe!  It's RIDICULOUS and I thank you
guys EVERY DAY that our list is SO much better!  You thought we had
KIDS on our list? Try out stealth_at_dragnet_dot_com! (No DON&quot;T really!)

Anyway, just had to give plenty of praise where it's due. You guys
(Thom, Ken, Stephen et al) make this list what it is. THANKS!!!
