While I didn't have the problems Greg did, I did have issues getting everything
dialed in and fitting.  This consisted of such diverse elements as:
wacking on the dash at the tab to &quot;lower&quot; it, wacking on the area above the 
window frame to get the frame &quot;higher&quot; and griding off a small amount of the
bottom of the latch.  Now that they're in, they open and close with mild
effort, which is what you want - too easy means you don't have enough
pressure on the rubber.  Oddly, I haven't tried leak-testing them yet.
