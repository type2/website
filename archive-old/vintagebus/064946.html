Subject: Re: [VB] slide in step question

Just thought I would mention an observation I have
made. I have never seen a step (VW aluminum) that was
bolted to the bus through the jack point. As far as I
know they were not bolted to the busas they never had
holes in them originally, but they did have a tension
spring that ran from the step to the underside of the
bus. I wouldn't be suprised if they had been drilled
in order to deter thiefs.
