I wholly agree with this.Working for an auto manufacturer I understand this
all too well.There are so many standards a production part has to meet
before it is released and if it fails later in life then it is recall time
and that is no fun at all.If the aftermarket people had to deal with NHTSA
lawyers they may wish they were dead instead of sitting in those meetings.A
friend of mine fiancee is into G ride mini trucks and wonders why some
components are always failing,I try to eaplain this same thing.Remember this
the next time you see that hoopty crackwagen on the side of the road with
the missing wheel due to wheel bearing failure from running a waaay offset
wheel.It will be real low ...on that corner.

I'm getting ready,so have at it

I agree.  I'm willing to bet that the average reader doesn't see
the connection between the &quot;tech&quot; article and the advertising dollars.

One problem I have with all the funky-fresh kustom stuff is 
supportability.  When you go and modify basic components with
stuff that some 2-bit outfit cobbled together, and one of those
components breaks, then what do you do?  Just hope that
that outfit is still around making the same bits?  And can
you buy individual pieces, or would you be stuck buying a whole
new assembly?  Are their manufacturing tolerances tight enuf that if
you *did* get a new piece, would it fit in with the old piece?
From what I've seen so far, I'd be highly doubtful.

And in either case, they &quot;own&quot; you now - if you have to fix it, you 
either buy from them or put it back to stock.

Some kustom stuff I've seen, I've just had to scratch my head and
ask &quot;why?&quot;&quot;  Like those serpentine generator belt kits.  What's
the point?  Looks?  I can't see how it would be any better functionally.
