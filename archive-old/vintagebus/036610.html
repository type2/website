&lt;&lt; So why would it be pictured in a '55 owner's manual? &gt;&gt;
Hi Everett,
Why would 1964 bus owners manual show pointy pre- late 62 front turn signals? 
 Why does the 1960 KG owners manual show Bastard 40 HP engine in the Ghia?  
Why because they made the owners manuals before making that model year VW and 
on occassion just left in previous pictures from years before that still 
showed to the normal layman what they were writing about.  Eric&amp;Barb
