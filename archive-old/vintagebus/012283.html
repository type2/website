Subject: door bumpers
Mime-Version: 1.0

I can't remember who posted this info to the list, but a little while ago someone mentioned the bumpers for door latches. I  am not sure what you call them. I thought mine were fine, and that the doors were just loud, but I have re-examined them lately and noticed that the rubber goes around the latch on the body, but it doesn't cover the part facing out of the bus.

Is this the way it should be. I get kind of a loud metal on metal clang when I shut the door to my bus. I am not sure if it is this 'bumper' or if it is the door seals, which are intact, but I think are actually squished so much that when i shut the door, the metal of the door hits the metal of the body.

Any ideas?
