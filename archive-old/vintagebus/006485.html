Subject: Early Bus seat padding

I was checking out my '55 front bench seat with an eye toward reupholstery
and was wondering the following:

Where to get the padding?  The '55 has some sort of original multi-colored
stuffing, not horse-hair padding.  Called Wolfsburg West, they didn't seem
to know what I was talking about and just tried to push me toward a guy
they work with to do the whole thing for me.  Uh, yeah, I think I can do a
Bench seat myself!   Any tips are welcome though.   :)

Thanks,
Everett
