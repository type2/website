Hi Joe,
Forgot to mention in our earlier post to also check the oil pickup tube when 
you have the sump plate off for looseness.  DR cases VW modified the pickup 
tube with a welded on bracket to bolt it to one of the sump plate studs.  
This prevents the pickup tube from wobbling the case hole into to a larger 
diameter allowing air to be sucked into the oil pump!  This modification 
should be done to any pre-DR case when you have it apart and center punch 
around the pickup hole in the case will tighten it back up.  
  Also your case being a early 1500 probably has no replaceable cam bearings 
so the case bore for the cam gets worn!  The case can be bored for later 
model replaceable bearings if you can find a shop with both the know how and 
tooling.
  Lastly upon rereading your post you do not really mention when (After 15 
seconds from starting it or 15 minutes of running around?) you have idle 
pressure problems.  It could be you are overreving it in the Florida heat and 
that is causing the engine to reach too high of oil temps and thinning the 
oil out too much.  We have had simular experience when carravaning through 
mountians at 3,000 RPM in third in 85F outside temp.  Turned out we needed to 
do 2,800 RPM to cure the problem for both buses for the rest of the trip.
