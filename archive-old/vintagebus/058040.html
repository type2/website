&gt; Well, I dunno.  Isn't that internal to the master cylinder?

Hi Curt,
If you mean the spacing between the pushrod and MC piston, then no.

  I don't &gt; know about the space.  BUT, last night I did take the sender off, 
&gt; and
&gt; screwed it back in, after doing all the testing Matt suggested.  Then I
&gt; screwed it back in, only not so tight.  Seems to have done the trick.
&gt; Does that sound okay?

Not really.  When you removed the sender this probably released the internal 
pressure of the MC and thusly when you reinstalled the sender it will stay 
off until you pump the brakes and repressure the MC.  On the other hand if 
the brake lights stay off then it was the sender or wires to the sender that 
were the cause.
