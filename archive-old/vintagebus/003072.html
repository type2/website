Subject: CDI ignition on a FI bus???

OK I've got a question, many years ago on discussing CDI ignitions with
someone back on v_at_l there was discussion of what needed to be done to
trigger the L-jet when converting to a CDI ignition.  However I've searched
the archives extensively tonight and could not find anything.  I was
thinking about an MSD 6AL as I have one available to me cheap, but frankly
want to be extremely cheap and not spring for the $40 (tach adapter kit)
they claim to use for the L-jet install, particularly as I vaguely recall
all that was involved was a diode and a couple resistors.  Any electronics
type gurus out there want to comment?  I'm crossing this to vintagebus in
the hope someone there might recall, hope not to offend any of the &quot;purist&quot;
types.
