Ya get what ya pay for.

Get the good ones.  I have personal experience with cheep seals,
and the leakage and aggravation installing them isn't worth the cost
savings.  Try ronnie; I think they were less than $100/door. Also,some
of the seals I got from Bus Depot were just plain wrong. Dunno where
the came from, but they weren't split bus seals.  I whined, and Rocky
Mountain Motor Works promptly sent me out a new set... of bay-window
seals complete with trim! (hehe, I got some trim!)

Buck up and buy the good stuff.

&gt; Happy Friday.  I was just wondering if anyone has tryed/sampled with any 
&gt; luck door seals from JC Whitney?  They have a 8 piece set to do bothe front 
&gt; doors for $40.  Just wondering if they compare at all to the kit Bus Depot 
&gt; offers for $100 a door? As always on Friday enjoy the weekend.
