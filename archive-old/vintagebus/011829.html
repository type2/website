Believe it or not but even the VanBondo family has been unable to locate the
&quot;Novemebr&quot; issue of Spellchecks &amp; HotVWs. Look for a huge yellow Newbeetle
on 2/3rds of the cover and the RFH and pretentious Puck trailer on the lower
1/3.

The month of the issue was incorrectly spelled or should I say mizpelt. I
personally don't think that its worth scanning and posting. Just watch for
it. It'll show up sooner or later.
