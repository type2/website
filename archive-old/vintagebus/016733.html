To the friendly and knowledge list members,
sorry to repost here but  was Porsche the last
 aircooled engine *developed* ?
 One would hardly call the mex bug a new and
 improved air cooled engine with lots of R&amp;D put in it sense it left
 Germany.
 Hardly porschephile myself, I don't know of they put synthetic or dino
oil in the
 car the last time they had a win at Le Mans.
  Dose any one know what oil did Porsche and &quot;Xbrand oil company&quot; develop
for their hi po Air cooled motors?
 
 mahalo
 Ken
