Subject: Re: [VB] AGAIN an aluminum case update

----- Original Message -----
&gt; Vendors have consistently stated that all issues
&gt; have been resolved, and many cases are in use
&gt; with no defects.

Not all vendors. We at Aircooled.Net have not sold a single Aluminum case
without letting the customer know about problems that have become common
with these cases. Almost all cases we sell end up being first sent to a
machine shop to be worked on, then passed onto the customer. Usually if we
sell an aluminum case to a customer without it going through the machine
shop first, it is to a reputable engine builder that can perform the machine
work themselves, or someone that has a local machine shop close to them that
they prefer.

We still do not feel the aluminum engine cases are to a point that someone
can simply buy it, and slap together an engine without any checks done to
the case. Mag cases are ususally what we recommend to people unless they are
running a HUGE power plant anyway.

Like I have said before, the aluminum cases are fantastic, BUT only after
all the gremlins are 'tweaked' out of them.  :-)
