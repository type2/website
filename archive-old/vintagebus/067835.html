&gt; well i just got a spare fuse box-and was planning on soldering this guy 
&gt; together, and realized it is not for a bus-but more likely an early bug. I 
&gt; may be able to take it apart, and clean everything, and put it back 
&gt; together in a &quot;bus&quot; configuration. then solder it together

Hi Kevin,
Pretty sure the bug fuse box will not work both due to being the wrong size 
and wired clipwise the wrong way.  Definitely it will not mount properly in a 
bus.

&gt; now I was just reviewing the previous questions I posted about soldering.  
&gt; How did you guys get flux into the fuse box...i was thinking a toothpick or 
&gt; something like that.

Apply a bit of flux to one edge of the clips and apply the hot soldering iron 
to the opposite edge.  When the heat works it way across enough to melt the 
flux paste and capilary action will suck in the flux between the individual 
brass clips used in post-1960 fuse boxes.  For some reason this also works 
well for solder not only due to capilary action, but that solder tends to 
follow the heat that melts it!

&gt; I imagine if I try to solder the connections with the fuse box apart-it till
&gt; be impossible to get it back together again.

Absolutely!
