The weather was really bad yesterday evening in Nashville. 
	Oh the wind and rain...	
	So I figured &quot;why not work on that '64 front axle you brought here from
Knoxville to have something to while away the hours?&quot;... alas, Jason
began working feverishly to beat the storm. Tie rods, steering damper,
shocks, a short (aka torched) piece of drag link... reluctantly severed
their oxide grip on kindred german steel and clattered to rest on a
japanese pickup bed liner. 
	Hub covers, spindle nuts of right and left-hand orientations,
lock-tabs, drums, shoes, springs, wheel cylinders, brake lines, backing
plates... these also were put aside in hastily organized piles as
flashes of lightning cut the sky just a ways north...
	Knowing he had little time to spare, our hero fought to sunder link
pins from their complementary torsion arms. Thwack, thwack, thwack...
kachink, kachink, kachink... risking life and limb in the face of nature
and the apartment complex manager, he accomplished the task with little
time to spare. Dashing down to his abode, he noticed that his dogs had
ferociously and willfully dismembered some abstract papyrus...
inconsequential, he thought, as he sprinted back upstairs with a fistful
of kroger-bags. 
	They had no choice of paper or plastic... only the plastic would bear
up under the looming onslaught of nature and isolate the hard-won
treasure from certain disaster. He worked quickly, conscious of what was
at stake. Missiles of water, seemingly particulate with their
velocities, peppered Jason while he desperately shoved 35 year old
consumables to safety under an aluminum truck-box, selflessly protecting
them with his own body even as the deadly rain hammered away on his poor
mortal form. Finally, all was secured.
	Nearly collapsing from exhaustion, he made it back to his apartment in
time to fill out canine damage report forms and other red tape as was
the norm with marathon VW work. Risking his life yet again, he walked
his dogs in the perilous weather to their satisfaction and returned to
expire on the futon, all but dead to the casual observer.
	He would learn the following day that his trade school (ahem,
college...) had sustained damage as well... collapsed chimney, rain
gutters, broken windows, etc... wild. that's Nashville weather....
	And... no, it wasn't too sappy. (tree joke....)
	...but we still have a ways to go afore we dare tread through Clara's
&quot;Psychedelic Bus Ride (low mechanical content)&quot; and/or A. Palmer's
&quot;Testimonial&quot; path(s) with surety... I stand in mute awe.

&gt;  I
&gt; could not even begin to think what would of happened if that tree would
&gt; of hit my bus.  The rainbow to me was a sign from the heavens about how
&gt; fortunate it was that I took my bus today.  Thanks for listening and
&gt; hope it was not TOO sappy!
