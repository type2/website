To test the accel. pump, it is easier to fill the float bowl and then to
operate it multiple times (say, 10).  Then divide the quantity collected
by the number of pumps to get the result.

Graduated cylinders are easily found at mail-order science suppliers, or
perhaps by saying nice things to a high school science teacher.  You want
a 10ml size (a ml is the same as a cc!)  While you're at it, get a lab
funnel that fits inside the graduated cylinder to make catching the fuel
easier.  You can use either plastic or glass cylinders, although the glass
ones make you feel a bit more like a &quot;real scientist&quot;  :)

&gt; &gt;PS Does anyone know where we could get a graduated test tube for
&gt; &gt;0 to 5 ccs?
&gt; 
&gt; You might try either of these two places...
