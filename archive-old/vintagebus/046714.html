 I know that there has been a bit of discussion on the weight of oil for hot
 weather driving.  Some dummy didn't really follow that close and is now
 about to make a 1000mi r/t in his 66 van in 100+ temps.
 
 Here in town (Vegas ) where it gets over 115 often, I run a straight 40 in
 summer and, plan my trips so I only run 15-20 min at a time and then stop
 for up to an hour but, going to be going to Salt Lake City end of the month
 and, it's all I-15 all the way, so, any suggestions?
  &gt;&gt;
funnily enough, when I think about getting an engine to run cool, the list of 
things to check has a big overlap with things to getthe heat working, because 
the heat and cooling systems all all interrelated.

engine to body seal good?
gaps in tin are bad
good engine compartments seal
plug holes in battery tray/alt batt tray (for air flow in engine compartment)
tune the bus up :)
check fresh air hoses are good, 
and good connections from fresh air hoses through into the heat exchangers
have the thermostat installed and working (flaps direct air for better 
cooling)
a doghouse is better than an upright cooler.,
a typeIV cooler mod is even better
have the L deflecter aka Hoover bit with your dog house
have the little air deflectors under the rear edge of the cylinder tin 
installed
I like my oil temp and pressure guages
oil temp really should be under 230, I feel uneasy if it gets over 210F 
(oil degrages with too hot a temp)


 heck, I don't live in the SW.   What do you desert bus people do when it is 
115F out and you are driving more than across town?   Drive at night?   Tie a 
bag of ice in the alt battery tray?  Drive the bus as fast as possible, D_at_mn 
the torpedoes, WOT?   Toss the guages out the window so they don't bother 
you? Drive the Dodge minivan?

 Inquiring minds want to know.
