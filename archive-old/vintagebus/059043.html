Subject: RE: [VB] Thanks to the list for the &quot;Hoover bit&quot; lead

That is what this piece is known as since Mr. Hoover expounded at length on
it's virtues relative to the lifespan of your aircooled T1 engine.  Try
this:

Funny thing is that right after posting the info below I went to get some
tin welded up for a T4 cooler conversion and had some time to kill while
waiting for it to be done.  Of course I went up the street to the Oakland
Pick and Pull junkyard and while there what do I find?  Why a long block
that someone had pulled from a '67 beetle.  It had the doghouse setup and
the really funny part is that someone took the shroud and all the tin but
left a perfect Hoover bit:)  It also had a really nice breather with the
drip tube that I might get tomorrow when I finish pulling out the rest of a
BA6 heater that was in an aircooled Westy Vanagon.  Sometimes you just have
a really good day at the bone yard.

BTW, anybody need a BA6?

&gt;
&gt;If that piece or it's &quot;arm&quot; is missing then there will be a gap ~ 3/8&quot; x
&gt;2-1/2&quot; just before the cooler at the bottom which will let some cooling air
&gt;escape back into the engine compartment.  I wonder if this piece shouldn't
&gt;have some foam seal on it also to stop air escaping around it.  I have seen
&gt;some that had the remnants of foam on them.  The &quot;Hoover bit&quot; used to be
&gt;hard to find but with the current crop of beetles hitting the junkyards you
&gt;should be able to locate one along with the shutters that were also hard to
&gt;find at one time.  Look for fuel injected beetles as I think that they were
&gt;relatively untouched until after people got wise to the need for the Hoover
&gt;bit and shutters.
