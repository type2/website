Subject: Re: [VB] First time non-greeting from ACVW

why dont you guys give this a rest.  i mean, hey i used to drive a baywindow
and  now i have my 65 on the road and drive that, but wave to everyone i see
driving a split, bay, vanagon, old beetle, ghia, 914, type 4, type 3,
harley, some ratty old pickup, whatever, who cares.  if they dont wave back
to you just dont wave to them again.  or you could follow them around, flag
them down, and give them your story about how &quot;rude&quot; they were not waving to
you and make sure they understand for the next time that its the hip thing
to do when you pass another bus.  does anyone here think that when a ford
escort driver doesnt wave to another ford escort driver,  he goes home all
sad and types that kind of crap into a computer and says to his buddies
&quot;dude, i waved to this dude in an early model escort today, and guess what?
he didnt even wave back!&quot;  now his buddies are all standing around with
their jaws on the floor and in disbelief.  i really dont think anyone in
this world is too good for the other.  some are friendly, some arent.
lastly kris, what does anyone have to be snooty about no matter what vehicle
they drive.

&gt; I think it should be the opposite, split drivers being too good for late
model drivers.  What could someone behind the wheel of a roundy possibly
have to be snooty about?

&gt; &gt; Ditto here,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Living in Orange County is somewhat of a double-edged sword. I want to
wave
&gt; &gt; at all the buses, split or not, but lots of them are too snooty to wave
&gt; &gt; back. I always get good reception from the splitties, but the bays and
&gt; &gt; later, esp T4, often give me the confused look...

&gt; &gt; &gt;Here in Southern California, if we waved at every bus we would have
&gt; &gt; &gt;arm cramps. I typically reserve my waving for splitties because they
&gt; &gt; &gt;are not as common (and I drive one). But if another bus driver waves,
&gt; &gt; &gt;I always return the favor no matter what they are driving. My son and
&gt; &gt; &gt;I love VW buses and we are always &quot;checkout&quot; splitties AND bays. (...)

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;Well, it's friday, so I guess I'm alright to ramble here for a
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;spell.  This past Wednesday, I was cruising down Rt. 68 in Xenia,
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;Ohio in my '66 Camper.  A buddy of mine was driving right behind me
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;in my '83 Vanagon. We were returning from a rock-climbing trip in
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;Clifton Gorge where we took a bunch of teen-agers from the YMCA teen
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;camp.  Right outside of town, I see a nice blue and white bay window
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;coming at me, nice bus.  So, of course I give a big, nice, friendly
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;wave out the window.  I get NOTHING from the bay window driver.  I
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;look in my rear-view and my buddy driving the Vanagon does the same
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;as me, gives a big friendly greeting.  Again, NOTHING from the
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;driver of the bay window! So, WTF?!?!?  This is the first time EVER
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;that I have been in my bus and NOT gotten a wave from another
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;passing bus driver.  Here in Ohio, air cooled buses are few and far
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;between, and when I see another one on the road I get very excited.
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;It's kinda like being told &quot;Hey, you're not alone out ther!
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;!
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;e!&quot; So, am I the only who feels like this when I see another bus on
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;the road? Tell me there are more people who do... Oh my God, I'm not
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;a freak am I!?!?!?  Wait a minute, don't answer that last
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;question....
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;
