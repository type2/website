Any suggestions on what type of tool and procedure you folks have found
successful in removing the pin that secures the e-brake handle?  I cant
seem to figure a way to get a hammer and punch up in there.  Bentley
just says remove the clips and pin and pull the handle out.  Oh, if it
were only that easy!
