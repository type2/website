i used to have an aftermarket temp switch that was actually the rear and top 
most case-bolt nut right above the pulley. it didnt affect the dipstick and 
also connected to the idiot light. it was blue unfortunetly i cant remember 
the manufacturer. i always thought it was berg but havnt seen it offerred 
since. a great part to put your mind at ease. i cruised all through mexico 
and it would come on if i stayed above 70 mph too long.
cool
zac
anything put together sooner or later falls apart
