...First, I'd like to thank Dave for responding to my
comments, despite my obvious attempts not to name
names. 

I actually am in agreement with Dave that this show
should remain air-cooled only, despite the wants of
the members of my Chapter. (And since Dave came out on
this one, so will I - we are the Atlanta Chapter of
Southeastern VW Club) I also want to see our Chapter
continue to support this show, which I think really is
one of the better shows in the southeast. (A quick
note- I believe VVWCA's rule on what constitutes
&quot;vintage&quot; is any VW over 25 years old, which now
includes early Rabbits and Sciroccos. If anyone can
confirm or deny this, I'd be very appreciative). 

Also, the Marietta show's focus on DRIVERS is truly a
wonder. I first attended the show three years ago, and
I was driving a 1971 Super Beetle that had been hit in
the front end, had no interior save driver's seat, a
cracked windshield, and a few other &quot;features&quot; I
wasn't proud of. I was not planning on entering it in
the show. I was waved into the show area from the
gate, despite my protests. I may have had the
worst-looking bug in the place, but I think it added
to my enjoyment of the show. 

Dave, tell me what time, and I'll see you at Maui Taco
on Wednesday, December 6th!

&gt; As the promoter of the show John is referring to,
&gt; the Georgia
&gt; Vintage VW Show, which Peach State Transporters
&gt; started
&gt; back in the early '90s I want to respond with my
&gt; opinion.  We
&gt; have always promoted the show as a &quot;Vintage VW&quot;
&gt; show, and
&gt; unless I am wrong, there are no watercooled VWs that
&gt; are
&gt; considered vintage.
&gt; 
&gt; There are *TONS* of VW shows now because everyone
&gt; and
&gt; his brother wants to promote one.  In my opinion,
&gt; the effect of
&gt; having a show scheduled for every weekend ends up
&gt; watering
&gt; down the quality of all the shows.
&gt; 
&gt; Our show is the ONLY show in Georgia out of a half
&gt; dozen or
&gt; so that is Vintage VW (air-cooled only) and I think
&gt; that is a
&gt; big draw for our show.  We always end up with about
&gt; 100 cars
&gt; in our show, which is more than any other VW show in
&gt; GA.
&gt; That tells me that the people WANT an air-cooled
&gt; only show.
&gt; The other thing that gives our show an identity is
&gt; it is a show
&gt; marketed to DRIVERS.  Our motto is, &quot;If you can
&gt; drive it, we
&gt; want to see it!&quot;  No more that 5 cars out of 90
&gt; showed up last
&gt; year on a trailer, &amp; I like those percetages.
&gt; 
&gt; There are at least 5-6 other shows in GA that allow
&gt; water-cooled
&gt; cars and have water-cooled classes, so I think their
&gt; needs are
&gt; being met by the other shows.
&gt; 
&gt; Kathy Jacobs of the SEVWC offered to help with our
&gt; 7th annual
&gt; show last May and I was grateful for her help.  She
&gt; mentioned
&gt; she had heard grumblings from a few water-cooled
&gt; people and I
&gt; offered her a compromise.  I told her that if
&gt; members of the
&gt; SEVWC wanted to set up a club display, I would allow
&gt; water-
&gt; cooled VWs to be displayed with the club display.  I
&gt; also made
&gt; the offer to let members of PST with Vanagons to
&gt; display them.
&gt; No trophy classes for the water-cooled or Vanagons,
&gt; but they
&gt; could be in club displays inside the show.
&gt; 
&gt; Traditionally I have done this show all on my own
&gt; and fronted all
&gt; the money for the show on my own.  It is a major
&gt; pain in the ass
&gt; to put a medium-sized show on all by yourself.  I am
&gt; very thankful
&gt; to have had help from both John Cloonan and Kathy
&gt; Jacobs this
&gt; year.  I hope to have their help next year as well,
&gt; but I think this
&gt; one show needs to remain air-cooled only, as it has
&gt; traditionally
&gt; been part of the identity of the show.  If their
&gt; needs were not
&gt; being met elsewhere I would re-consider...  but
&gt; there are shows
&gt; out there to suit everyone's needs.
