This was all the rage in the mid 70's.  We had a kit installed on our 454 C*hev crew cab (poor excuse for a &quot;real crew cab&quot;).  The thing I remember is what a pain it was to keep filling the reservoir.  There was also no provision for knowing when the tank was dry, except the
massive amount of pinging the motor was producing.  Seemed to work though.  Not sure how it affected mileage

&gt; Some of the turbo kids run water injection, which is supposed to have
&gt; some cooling effect to prevent detonation.

This was in the years before precise air/fuel metering &amp;  fuel injection, knock sensors, and computers monitoring everything.  It was about all they had.  Cheaper than a intercooler...same purpose though.
