&gt; Ring compressor

Preferably one that disassembles, so that you can install the pistons to
the rods, then install the cylinders..

Also, you'll need the usual assortment of metric sockets, extensions, and
ratchets....probably find uses for metric wrenches, as well.

You'll need a heafty pair of snap ring expansion pliers, to remove the
ring at the rear of the crank.

Some emory paper to clean all of your sealing surfaces, a jig to hold your
crankshaft (a vice with your flywheel locked in it will do, but a gland
nut welded to your engine stand is nicer..)

An assortment of small files for cleaning up any burrs anywhere, a pan and
veggie oil to heat your crank gears for reinstallation, heavy gloves for
the same..

Of course, a breaker bar and 36mm socket for flywheel installation and
removal..

Some sort of jig, most likely, to press the piston wrist pins out of your
old pistons (carbon buildup makes these like to stay in their holes..)

Needle nose pliers, for various things...

More i'm sure...I havent got my poor thing assembled yet, still waiting on
my heads. (and a tranny to mate it to!)

good luck...
