I have noticed in a few of my catalogs that the front wheel cylinders are

different for 55-63 and 64-70 busses.  The different two cylinders are said

to be both 25.40mm.  I know the rears are the same from 55-71.  Are these

fronts interchangable also?  Just trying to save this poor teacher $$$$$

unfortunately the early front cylinders are not available Brasialian, and you
must buy German when replacing them, which does cost more.     Tant pis.

My recommendation to to take them apart and clean and inspect them if you have
doubts of there servicability.  rebuild kits should be about $2 apiece, if the
metal is good, it saves bucks.   Also flush your brake system *every* year, to
promote longetivity of hydraulic parts.

(my bug had a bleeder valve broken of in one rear clyinder, and I never bled
it for about 5 years- it, of course was the one that went, so I replaced both
back ones.   I still have the fronts it came to me with 8 years ago, working
fine- flush those brakes)
