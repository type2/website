Hi Wade,
The VW factories painted the rims black first and painted on the outerside 
there for whichever color was required that day.  So perhaps you are just 
seeing either the black paint on the innerside of the rim or the black paint 
that was previously under the other paint color/s of that manufacturing day 
outerside.  Eric&amp;Barb
