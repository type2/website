 specific adjustment.  I was going to buy the book but
 it seems a little silly to pay $40.00 for two pages in
 a book.  Can anyone help?
  &gt;&gt;
I recommend getting the book.   I find a bentley for 1600 (bug or bus) useful 
now and then.   they are sometimes available at swaps or used book stores at 
less than the cover price.  That said, I hope someone gets you the info you 
want.
