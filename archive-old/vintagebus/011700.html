Subject: '64 EZ Camper Double Door
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

I recently pulled home an old camper - it appears to be an EZ. The interior is nearly identical to that shown in the aforementioned brochure. There is some body damage and a little bit of rust, but overall it is in pretty good shape. The interior is all original and in excellent condition. It is a DOUBLE DOOR, also a walk-through. I found it behind a repair shop in Mason, Texas, where it had sat for several years. It was last registered in 1990. The registration says it is a 1965, but the chassis number (1181XXX) indicates that it is an early '64 model. It still has the engine and tranny. The engine is an H-model case (#H0590XXX) and is apparantly from a '67. There is a chrome &quot;1500&quot; emblem on the engine door. The motor still turns although I haven't tried to fire it up yet. And yes - it does have the large truck mirrors, also an altimeter! (Lets you know if you get too high, I guess.) 6-v electrics; still has chrome church key in original holder, and included the VW owner's manual (for a cargo van - this started out as a model 215). A great find for $200! I hope to start the resto soon.

The only significant missing parts are the back bumper and the apron - the piece of bodywork that goes behind the engine. I have access to one from a later model bus - a '69 - and wondered if it would fit, or could be easily modified to fit. If anyone is familiar with this, or if you know the whereabouts of a reasonably priced rear bumper and apron, let me know.
