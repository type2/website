Porsche 356, pre 55 also used the same master by the looks of the one in the
photo, go to a Porsche swap and sell it for 200 bucks, i have a few of these
put away from my Porsche days, and they didn't get ruined in the fire.

ps, i could be wrong but if my memory serves me right these were used all
the way to 1959 in Porsche A models, but i could be wrong,as memory goes
with age.

Probably not interesting to most of you but I'm a big proponent of passing
on VW information so here's a photo of mine:

Note the aluminum reservoir with the ATE-logo'd screw top.

So if you see one at your local swaps, think about picking it up if the
price is right.

Later,
Everett Barnes
