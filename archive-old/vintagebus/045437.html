Working on my horn, which died a few weeks ago. I read the Bentley, and Muir
Manuals. Basically it there are two wires going to the horn, one live, one
ground.  I touch the live to the body and get a spark. The ground is, well,
grounded.  I scrubbed all the contacts with a wire brush. Still nothing.
According to Bentley, you can adjust the contact on the horn, to adjust the
HONK.  I thought maybe, it has just loosened up, therefore no HONK. I took the
horn off,  started fooling with the contact screw, located on the bottom.
Then I figured, with the contact adjusted properly the resistance between the
two cire connections should be zero, or close to it. So I hooked up my
ohmeter(I think thats what you call it while checking ohms), adjusted the
screw until the resistance dropped from one to near zero. Hooked the sucker
back up, and HONK. It worked, but just one short noise, then nothing. I
checked the resistance again between the leads, and it was back to one, and no
amount of!
 adjusting could get it any lower.

I test a horn with a battery charger

also, make sure the power is powering, and that the ground at the button is
connected, and where it contacts the steering wheel is clean (sandpaper).
That's my 3 cents.
