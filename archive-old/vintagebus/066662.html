Subject: RE: [VB] Some engine questions

[...]
&gt;So I guess you're talking a 1776cc? I have heard good
&gt;things about that size and a bus. If it's all apart
&gt;though, I would get a CW crank and doghouse set up. I
&gt;would prefer a new dual relief case to be
&gt;honest,especially if you are going to have to get it
&gt;bored for the bigger P &amp; C's,  but if it's in good
&gt;shape and not too pounded use it. You could allways
&gt;put in an Okrasa engine too!

Yep, 1776, mostly cause those are the parts that I've had in the
garage, this is a low buck engine, but I'd still like to have it live
a good bit :) For all out life, I'd get a CW crank also, but I need
this pronto, and that's what I got, same with the case.

Thanks for the suggestions!
