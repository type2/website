Hello,

I have always wanted a bus, and I am now thinking
about buying one.  My reason for buying one is for a 9
month trip around the states.  I recognize this list
is biased, but would you recommend the bus to me?  How
much would I be looking at spending for a bus that is
in good enough condition to handle the trip?  I know
little to nothing about buses except that I have
always loved the way they look.  Where should I turn
to learn more about buses?  Any input is greatly
appreciated.  I would also appreciate any input on
where I can purchase a nice bus, or at least give me
an idea of where I am headed.  

I really like the Westfalia from 63-67.  They may all
look the same and spread out over longer dates, but I
only know what I have seen on web sites.

Thank you

New to the Bus

Keith
