&gt;&gt; Think the lack of that underneath engine tin was a factor?
Does that underneath engine tin help in cooling? &lt;&lt;
Hi Jdd,
We doubt that the lack of tin added to the early 40 HP stud from pulling out, 
but that tin does help keep the engine temps more even especailly in colder 
weather.  Plus protects the push rod tubes from rocks thrown up by the tires.  
As for driving it this way for years really is not a good test.  As Indiana 
Jones said in the first movie, &quot;It's not the years, it's the miles!&quot;
