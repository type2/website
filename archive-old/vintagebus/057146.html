Subject: Re: [VB] Re: tent

You got me. The tent, pop top and rack were all
options and I would guess that they were fitted at
westfalia but I could be wrong. My Bus was bought here
but was picked up in europe. I have seen a '67 with
the aluminum &quot;slider&quot; as well. Who knows? What does
your VIN say? I have a stamp on mine.

&gt; I've got a '67 B42 as well but no sign of any
&gt; aluminum runners for the tent
&gt; it is supposed to have ( stripped paint to bare
&gt; metal before repaint). It
&gt; did have the roof rack on it at one time as I can
&gt; see the indents from the
&gt; legs left on the roof gutter.
&gt; 
&gt; Anyway what if you walked into the dealer back in 
&gt; Jan '66 and wanted a
&gt; Westfalia without the tent ( an C42 Westfalia) and
&gt; all the dealer had was a
&gt; B42 lying around the lot. I doubt he would let the
&gt; sale go and probably kept
&gt; the tent...... So did the aluminum trim for the tent
&gt; get installed by the
&gt; dealer before delivery?
&gt; 
&gt; Or another possibility for my B42 .......did I get
&gt; the early '68 tent with
&gt; the floor...... By March of '67, the interior
&gt; handles on the interior
&gt; Westfalia cabinets started with the '68 style going
&gt; into the new model year.
&gt; 
&gt; I haven't found anybody able to answer this question
&gt; yet....

&gt; &gt; There is a aluminum &quot;runner&quot; afixed to the
&gt; passengers
&gt; &gt; side drip rail that the stand alone tent attaches
&gt; to.
