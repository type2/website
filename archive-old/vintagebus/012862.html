If I can add to the employment thread: I'm an anthropologist with the
National Museum of Denmark and have a research project in Bolivia.  Actually
the project is in spread across three South American countries, but I  work
primarily in Bolivia with Quechua Indians in two remote villages assessing
landuse practices on local and regional ecology.

It's a job that involves a fair amount of travel and a busy schedule but
also many   opportunities to spot old buses in strange places. Incidentally,
some of the regions I work in are very remote, and I always travel with a
small pack of photos that I will often show to my hosts. These include snap
shots of my life: wedding photos, my house and my bus (1961, 221). The idea
is to try and show people a bit of the context which I live. The bus photos
are often quite a big hit.

Anyway, the work schedule this last half year was tough but I finally
finished cleaning up after the fire I had last fall. (Many thanks for all
those past suggestions and words of encouragement.)

While the fire damage was limited to burnt cables and charring, the worst
problems arose from the caustic reaction of the extinguisher¹s chemicals.
Surface rust bloomed throughout the sprayed area and involved a major
cleaning up.

Well that¹s behind me now, and everything is up an running again, but with a
slight problem.

In the process of cleaning up I also removed the gas tank, cleaned and
repainted it. While I'm sure that I replace the fuel tap in the correct
position, it now only works in the reserve position. When I put it in the
normal position it cuts the gas supply. Running permanently on reserve is
going to lead to problems so any advice would be appreciated. I plan on
driving down to the Willi Lottermann meet in June an would like to have this
problem settled. I ought to add that while it is possible that some
contamination lodged in the fuel strainer in the tap, I was very careful to
keep everything clean. Any suggestions?
Glen.
