put a straight edge on them and make sure they are not bent, also check that
all arms are still parallel, clean and check the bushings inside the beam,
clean all the torsion springs and make sure they are not cracked, this takes
care of the arms, then we'll move on to the link pins.

Ok, I got the trailing arms out.  Managed to slightly munge the ends on one
side, but I think it's recoverable.

I took Ronnie's suggestion and removed the movable side, then tried
pounding thru the other way.  It was moving a little, but not much.  So I
put a 1/8&quot; socket over the torsion bar, used my monster 3-arm puller, and
pushed the torsion bar thru.  The last couple inches were still difficult,
but I got it out.

Now that I have them out, what now?  I don't have the parts to rebuild them
properly.  I'm thinking I should clean them all up, re-grease them, and put
it all back together.  A lot less chance of munging or losing parts that
way!
