Maybe it is just me but I sleep with my head facing the front of the bus.  so
no &quot;headbanger&quot; problems (although still have an affinity for &quot;masters of
reality&quot; every now and then).

Early bay window cabinet should be a pretty close fit , (and cheaper too)
although I dunno if it would follow the curvature of the roof properly? I
think  splitty have a more pronounced &quot;curve&quot; to the roof than do bays.
