&lt;&lt; What is the best material to use for interior panels for a 64-67 bus?
 I have redone all the screw in panels with 1/8&quot; hard board and they work
 great.
 
 The front doors and rear hatch use the snap in clips.  the ones that you
 can get right now are too short to use with 1/8&quot; material.  What are you
 all using.
  &gt;&gt;

yes the 1/8 stuff is thicker than original, so you get problems with using it 
for the snap in panels.

I used 1/8 on my 65, and with rough sanpaper sanded down on the non shown 
side of the panel, all around the edege,  enough so the snaps stay.  except a 
couple popped.
