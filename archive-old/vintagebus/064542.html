Subject: Re: [VB] Ride Height.

I agree this should be the ideal case. Some say that there is a LEFT and
RIGHT bar, although I have never found the markings to be intuitive to
which is which, or anyone to say what to look for. I THINK if you
swapped sides after they were happily there for a while, something bad
might happen.
But, why do so many old ghias and beetles sag some then? I have a ghia
with a slight sag that has never had the torsion bars out. The need to
put another 'click' or two in indicates the bar is now twisting more
under the same load...
What a bummer to set the bars and all that measuring, then to have her
not sit just right....

&gt; Steel springs do not 'settle' unless they are overstressed and the metal
&gt; deforms (elastic limit is exceeded). I would think that the VW engineers
&gt; designed the torsion bars to take infinite life (or close to it), so you
&gt; should be able to bottom out either the front or rear without exceeding the
&gt; elastic limit, therefore sag should not happen. (Theory is nice until
&gt; reality sets in. What a concept.)
