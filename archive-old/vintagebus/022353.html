Why on Earth do I feel like I'm the only one here who wouldn't want to buy
a house in a neighborhood where junked cars are happily strewn about the
residents' yards?  If I spend $200K on a house (I live in CA), I doubt I
would like it if my neighbor drug home a heap and left it in the front yard
for all to see.  People take the same pride in their homes as we take in
our VW's.  It's a common courtesy not to let your house become the single
factor that drives real estate prices down in your neighborhood.  It's
incumbent upon the resident, regardless of whether you rent or own.   Think
about it - What if you just finished your 23-window walk-through
restoration, and someone came along and did something the was likely to
lessen its &quot;perceived&quot; value.  You'd be up in arms, too.

With that said, I will admit that I live in a house in a nice neighborhood
with great neighbors.  I have a 2-car garage and 4 cars.  I currently feel
guilty because my fully registered and insured (but unrestored)'64 SC sits
outside in the driveway, looking to some like an eyesore.  Also sitting
outside is my nice-looking daily driver, a M*zda RX-7.  Inside are the
newly-acquired heap of a '60 DD panel, and the fully-restored '66 Ghia
cabrio.  The ugliest and most irreplaceable are inside, the 2 functional
ones out.  And I'm considering putting the Ghia in storage and getting the
SC back into the garage, out of respect for my neighbors.  

The moral?  Take into consideration how your neighbors might feel.  They
likely have a much larger investment in their home than you have in your
splittie (unless we're talking about Thom's barndoor, but that's a
different story!).  If you can't drive it, get it out of sight.  If it's
been sitting for years without you doing anything to it, sell/give/loan it
to someone who will.  Don't make your neighborhood the next &quot;That's a
crappy neighborhood, you wouldn't want to live there&quot; place.

&lt;/soapbox&gt;
