Subject: metal site
Mime-Version: 1.0
X-Originating-IP: 209.158.69.101

Several weeks ago, there was a site on this list that fabricated sheet metal
parts for the bus.  I think it was Metal Wizard, or Metal Magic or ...
The site had pictures of replacing the front of a 69-70 bus.  Great site,
but I lost my bookmarks when the computer was repaired.  Does anyone know
where this site is located?  I would like to review the process again.

Any help would be appreciated.

Dr. Chuck
