&quot;I well remember how awesome it was riding in the back Jeremy Vreeman's bus 
and watching him navigate the turns like he was some kind of bus pilot so 
now I was in that position and loved every minute of taking my friends for a 
ride in my bus.&quot;

NQ, do you know Jeremy very well?  My heart just about skipped a beat when 
you mentioned his name.  I currently own the bus you talk about in there.  I 
have his college address, but I think he has since graduated.  Do you know 
how I could contact him?
Thanks,
-wes
