Subject: paint guns and paint

It is time for me to buy a new paint gun.  It will be used to shoot
paint only.  Not primer.  I already have a primer gun.

The local paint store was not too much help, so i will ask you all.
What gun's are you all familier with?  I know i want a gravity feed HVLP
gun that will be used with a air compressor.  The local shop uses SATA
brand gun's.  Do any of you have a HVLP gun?  Used one ever?  have any
input as to info or ???

I have seen them priced up to $350.  I don't want to spend that if i do
not have to.

I think this has been discussed, but what type of paint are you all
opting for?  Acrylic Enamil is no longer available here is Cal. That is
what i have shot in the past.  Single stage only.   I am using stock
colors. I am willing to try base/clear coat if need be.  I am looking
for info on what you all have shot either yourself or by a shop and what
you liked or disliked.   Is there a web page for this type of info?

Thanks
Matthew
