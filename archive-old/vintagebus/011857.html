Subject: I won! I won! &lt;f&gt;

Pim van Loon &lt;ploon_at_vweuro_dot_demon.nl&gt; has informed me that I won Second Prize
in the VW Euro trivia contest! Hahahahahaha! Dumb luck and web research paid
off! =)

The contest asked three questions:

1) Where is VW Euro held?
2) Which model (year) is Herbie?
3) How many beetles fit in a kilometer?

Who the hell knows how I won... Herpie the Lust Bug and the event locale
info were found on the web in two seconds. Who's in Grant's Tomb?  I spent
too much time trying to convert US miles into Kilometers. Freekin metrics! I
averaged the length of an early split oval Beetle, a late Beetle, and a New
Beetle and divided into the mile to kilo conversion results. I am &quot;way&quot; math
phobic so I saw it as a personal challange. Well, actually it was either
that or suffering through yet another intollerable episode of &quot;Mad About
You&quot;, &quot;Friends&quot; or that wasted &quot;Ally McMale-Bash&quot; with the wife. Hmmmm...
Decision time... &lt;tick-tock tick-tock&gt; 
Hate math and enter a contest for a VW event on another continent that I'll
never see *or* watch a girlie sit com. Uh, math sucks but sitcoms REALLY
reek! I'd rather lay under an abandoned cobb webbed bus on a humid day in
uncut grass infested with chigger bugs and mangey kittens breathing bad
seeping tranny fluid and old coagulated oil.
Naw I'll enter this contest...


For my efforts I won:

A basic (prize) pack which contains: 
* A VW Euro '98 poster
* A VW Euro '98 rally shield
* An _at_-sticker
* A GGC baseball cap
* A GCC tax-disc holder
* Some GCC stickers

PLUS!

A GCC wrist watch! 


Whey Coolio! Whoo Hoo! &lt;jumping all around the room nearing incontinence&gt;
Just what I need is a GCC tax-disc holder &lt;whatever the &quot;bloody&quot; hell that
is...&gt;

See http://members.xoom_dot_com/ploon/vweuro98/contest.htm for more details!
(Thanks Pim) =)
