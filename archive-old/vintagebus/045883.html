I'm sure you're right, I've never come across a pre-67 12v Bus, but I've
only owned about 13 splitties (which I thought was a lot until I started
reading this list! :) 

When my 6v 2 speed wiper failed (rolling into Seattle at 4:30 AM in the
rain, no less!) I replaced it with a ~'67 or '68 Bug motor. It takes
some work, but it's been reliable.

so you have a 66 bus?   The size and shape of the wiper motor is the same 66
and 67.   But the heat vents were changed and to install a motor that shape
into a 65 or earier  the tubes have to be mashed a bit.  (some people call
this massaging)   I am not into that- not sure if the motor you are talking
about are what shape.  but yes I have heard you can use a 12V bug motor.

 The only difference I encountered was
the distance between the drive shaft (out of the gear box) and the
attachment point on the crank arm. I had to move this pin, which I
detailed in a post to the old list (prior to the split). 

If you're into practical, not resto, this might be an option... or at
least get you by until you can find that MIB NOS '67 wiper motor for $5!

p-mail if you need more details.

&gt; &lt;&lt; BTW: 12v was an option from '64 on (correct year, Clara?), so there are
&gt;  older gauges that should be 12v (unless VW used a voltage drop, which I
&gt;  doubt).  &gt;&gt;
&gt; -  - -
&gt; from 63.  But that is like the proverbial needle in the haystack .  and
rusty
&gt; and probably nonfunctional.  Now find me and NOS one and good 12V 65 wiper
&gt; motor (some listee has a stock 12V 65 and I envy that wper motor.   Maybe
back
&gt; to  6V with it I'll go)
