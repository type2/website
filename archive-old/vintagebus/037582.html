To All:

...or perhaps that should be 'For Some'... for those of you who have been 
following my alternative fuel/engine experiments.

Although there about a dozen potential donor engines for splitties -- and 
several dozen for 'loafs,  by Christmas of 1998 I'd pretty much settled on 
using an early Subaru engine, the non-turbo'd 1781cc (ie, 92x67) OHV model 
'EA-82' (generic -- there are at least six flavors of 'EA-82'.  This one is 
the 'plain vanilla version :-) 

(The Subaru line includes a 24 valve, dual overhead cam, six cylinder 
horizontally opposed turbosupercharged, fuel-injected 230 hp monster.  That's 
stock.  Tweaked, it has been known to do a bit more.  It is very popular with 
Porsche owners who are tired of having their doors blown off by kiddies in 
Sentra's :-)

Major factors in the selection process were the engine's weight -- only 22 
pounds more than the stock 1584 (not counting the radiator &amp; plumbing) -- and 
power specs, 82 hp _at_ 4800 rpm, 101 ft/lbs _at_ 2800 (as compared to 65hp _at_ 4600 
and about 60 ft/lbs _at_ 3200).  (These numbers reflect the better volumetric 
efficiency of the more modern Subaru engine, which used a compression ratio 
of 9:1 and a computerized combustion controller. )   Despite the small weight 
gain, I must still include some form of rear cross-member.  The existing 
system of tranny mounting on splitties is simply inadequate to deal with the 
torque, even from the stock engine.

Having decided on an engine the next problem was finding one.  And finding 
the money.  There are plenty of these engines available -- you need only call 
one of those 'Low-Time Import Engine' dealers.  But they aren't cheap.  The 
aviation community has come to recognize the superior qualities of the Subaru 
as a powerplant for lightplanes and that demand has caused a steady rise in 
their price.  But even more significant is the fact such engines are not 
complete.  They are sold without any accessories -- many do not even include 
the water-pump, stretching the definition of 'accessory' to the breaking 
point :-)

I needed a complete engine.  And radiator.  Indeed, were I forced to buy the 
carburetor, alternator, water-pump, air-cleaner, distributor and so forth, I 
would have to pay as much as $1200.  And I couldn't afford that.  Whatever 
the cost of the engine there was still the cost of the conversion kit -- the 
stuff needed to mate the engine to the VW transmission (the kit is available 
&gt;from KEP -- Kennedy Engineered Products) -- which runs about $500.  So I put 
the idea on  the back burner.  But kept looking.

Persistance furthers :-)

After six months of looking, I heard about an unfortunate 1985 Subaru station 
wagon, unfortunate in that just weeks after the owner  had one of  those 
low-time engines from Japan installed, a 'mysterious' clunking was diagnosed 
as failed CV joints, the repair of which was quoted at about the same price 
as the recently replaced engine.  Disgusted, the owner parked it and bought a 
Toyota.  That was two years ago.  (Point of Interet:  The owner bought the 
Chilton manual for the Subaru.  Besides virtually ignoring the 1800cc pushrod 
engine, Chilton claims the front CV's can not be repaired by the owner, the 
work must be done by a 'qualified' shop.  Which is all horseshit, of course.) 

After two years the unfortunate Subaru had accumulated a collection of 
notices and fines, some from the city, others from the apartment complex 
where the owner lived.  

I understood the owner's plight and did not wish to take unfair advantage.  
But I'd budgeted only $400 for an engine, influenced by the availability of 
brand new VW engines for only $1000.  I used that figure -- $1000 -- as my 
budget-goal for this particular project, including the cost of both engine 
and conversion kit.  

The bottom line is that after three weeks of friendly haggling I bought the 
vehicle for $375.  (Anyone interested in an engine-less Subaru? :-)

The vehicle could be driven... sorta :-)  Not very well but enough for me to 
herd it home using four-wheel drive.  I now have about ten days to vanish a 
1985 Subaru :-)  To accomplish that particular trick I will disassemble the 
entire vehicle, hopefully selling the glass, fenders, doors, running gear, 
bumpers and so forth then slicing the shell of the unibody into manageable 
pieces and hauling them to the crusher at a local scarp metal yard.  With a 
bit of luck -- and ten days of sweaty effort -- I may eventually recover the 
cost of the engine by selling the bits &amp; pieces.

All indications are that the engine is in near-new condition. (average 
compression, 155 with a range of only 8 pounds -- about 2.5% -- good enough 
so that a leak-down test isn't justified.) I'll still take it apart, of 
course, just to get to know it.  

The Subaru is a modern engine having a full-flow oil filtration system, fully 
counterweighted crankshaft, hydraulic lifters and an electronic ignition 
system.  It's components are balanced to modern-day specifications.  (I don't 
especially care for the EGR arrangement -- the plumbing is a nightmare.  I 
may remove it.) Normal service life of such an engine is 150,000 miles or 
more with several examples having gone done twice that before needing a major 
overhaul.

Is this a practical conversion?

The answer to that hinges largely on me -- on whoever does the conversion.  
The major sticking point is where to install the radiator on a vehicle that 
was never designed to use one.  The most logical place -- and the surest path 
to success -- is to put the radiator on the front of the vehicle, using any 
of a number of proven techniques to provide the necessary plumbing.  Indeed, 
the Vanagon provides an excellent engineering model as how best to install 
the pipes, hoses and radiator.

But then, it wouldn't be a splittie, would it?

So I'm trying something different.  It probably won't work... but perhaps I 
can figure it out. 

So why the push-rod 1800 when there are bigger guns available?  Because I 
don't need any more.  We're planning another trip to Alaska... and Cabo is 
always calling, just down the road.  I want reliability, not speed.  I want 
to keep the stock clutch -- bigger ones are available but the price goes up 
dramatically.  I want reasonable fuel economy -- the 1800 has delivered over 
25mpg in other splitties.  I want to keep the outboard gearboxes -- they 
provide better ground clearance and superb low-end torque with a basically 
stock tranny... of which I have several. 

But mostly I want to continue my propane experiments.  Raising the 
compression ratio of an air-cooled engine to the point where I can recover a 
more reasonable percentage of the energy contained in propane has lead to 
unacceptably high cylinder head temperatures.   Increasing the displacement, 
allowing me to equal the output of a stock engine, while using lower 
compression ratios only works up to a point, then you run into the heating 
problem again, this time because the jugs (and heads) have proportionally 
LESS cooling area as they become larger.  This is a fundamental limitation of 
the VW engine.  To improve the situation calls for additional fin area on the 
heads and the use of 9mm sodium-filled exhaust valves -- I'll end up with a 
reliable, powerful, propane-fueled VW... but at a cost and complexity that is 
impossible to justify.  (Depending on its composition -- which the oil 
companies deliberately vary to make it less desirable as a motor vehicle fuel 
-- propane contains 14% to 22% less energy per pound than gasoline.  Convert 
a stock 65hp VW to propane and you have a very nice 50hp engine... which is 
fine, until the first hill comes your way.  Raising the cr will increase the 
power... but it also increases the waste heat.  Increasing the displacement 
while keeping the cr low will increase your power... but you'll need about 
2000cc's to guarantee 65hp... unfortunately, bigger jugs have LESS cooling 
area than stock jugs -- you are generating 'stock' hp but find yourself 
running hot any time the ambient temp goes above 85 or so.  Increasing your 
oil cooling capacity isn't the solution -- the exhaust valves are still 
running way too hot.  This is not a problem you'll see with a big-bore 
stroker burning gasoline, which uses part of the incoming charge to cool the 
exhaust valve.  Propane is already a 'perfect' gas -- it appears to very 
little cooling ability once it is in its gaseous state.  Live &amp; learn :-)

The stock 9 to 1 compression ratio of the Subaru needs only minor tweaking to 
be optimized for the 100+ octane rating of propane.  And the watercooled 
design allows me to start at a level well above where even the most radically 
modified VW ends.  Fuel vaporization, something of a hassle on the 
propane-powered engine I built, becomes a no-brainer when hot water is 
available.

In any case, it should prove to be an interesting summer :-)
