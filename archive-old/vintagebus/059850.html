Subject: Weird engine case help.

Found an NOS engine case, with a weird feature. The cyl areas are raised
off the block, like recesses that would shroud about 1/4 of the pistons?
Any clue what that's for? I'll have the Audi/VW numbers tomorrow. It's
flat 4, maybe a t4 case? (I'm t4 ignorant)
Thanks,
Al
