Subject: Re: [VB] input shaft play q

The front of the tranny does not have a bushing to keep the input shaft 
from moving sideways. It relies on the bearing in the gland nut for 
this. The c-clip is just for holding the reverse gear in place. The 
internal and external input shafts are actually held together by a 
small stud. The exterior input shaft is screwed onto the interior input 
shaft and then the splined reverse gear is slid over that mating 
section. The c-clip is the applied to hold the splined reverse gear in 
place.

&gt; Is there some play here, assuming we have just a c clip holding it in? 
&gt; I

&gt; this on
&gt; the old trans and this one after rebuild, just confirming. No sign of 
&gt; any

&gt; I have some movement in and out, not much, and very little inside to
