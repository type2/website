I dont feel that the listing  implies a driving vehicle, but for some folks 
you gotta lock the caps and spell it out. The part I'm confused about is that 
its a 61 with fried egg turn signals and oval tail lights. New nose? hacked 
in signals? doesnt seem like a bad deal anyway. I know a guy who has a rusted 
out 63 with no tranny or motor and no deluxe bits, He wants 1500 for it.
