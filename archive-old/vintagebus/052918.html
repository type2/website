Subject: Taking a Friday Privilege, Trade me!

Ahhhh, gotta love Friday where you can shamelessly plug VW projects you have going on.  Actually I have 2 things:  Parked next to my 71 Westy (theres the obligatory bus content) I have a 73 Super Beetle I aquired in a trade.  I had every intention of restoring it, but I just don't feel like.  I'm not much of a beetle fan, buses are my first love (hey, more bus content!) So I am looking to &quot;lose&quot; it. I also have the GOOD CH*VY full size work pick up for trade (did you guys know that Everett now has a &quot;trades&quot; category on the Samba Classifeds  http://www.thesamba_dot_com/vw/classifieds ? You can see the truck here.)  Anyway, I want to trade or sell the bug and the truck and somehow get another bus out of the deal.  So, I am open to any and all trade for these items.  I will probably want to keep the 1600 engine out of the bug, but the shell is restorable.  Or I will the trade the running bug PLUS the pick up truck for a running bus of any vintage!!  I also like ALL aircooled VW's, S!
TANDARD Bugs included, guitars, and good beer, so put together an offer for one or both of these vehicles and lets do some good ole fashioned horse tradin!  I am located just North of CINCINNATI, OHIO.
