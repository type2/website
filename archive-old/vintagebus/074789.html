&gt; I am not sure how they would be posted or reproduced.
&gt; (ANYONE??)  

.  How would you
&gt;&gt; post something like that though?  It's too big to
&gt;&gt; print out and copy onto the new panel.

Hmmmm, I suppose you could break them up into 8 1/2&quot; x 11&quot; sections that are
jpegs or pdf's or something else common, &amp; then print them out on your
printer &amp; tape em together w/ match lines like I did w/ Thom's colored
wiring diagrams.  Or they could be emailed to a printer w/ a large plotter &amp;
printed out full size??
 Kinko's could do this if you gave em a autocad or similar file.
