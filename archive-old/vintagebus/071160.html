Subject: RE: Folding Ladders Variations

Both of these original VW ladders work just VWonderfull----Its the lower set
of legs that is different by about 4&quot; on the VW Dealer 1967 model ( HWE ) --
so it makes no difference--I tried the &quot;new one&quot; from 1967--and it fits
Vantastic on my Bessie, a 1967 Hippy Bus, with a 3/4 metal rack----uj

Subject: Folding Ladders Variations


&gt; When the  two folding ladders are placed side by side--there is a
difference
&gt; in the placement of the one set of legs that rest against your bus--

Looking at VW roof rack's over the years and ladders, the placement of the
ladder legs should be at the belt line and the top of the rear tires. If it
isn't, you may be missing a piece to the roof rack to get the ladder to
mount properly. Otherwise, broken glass or dented side panels can result if
you use it......

The ladder I acquired was a quality folding repro that fits into the gutter.
Bought it from Trevor Sharp for around $100, but haven't seen his name
lately.

Jeff Slater up in Washington state also used to have a Westy platform rack
with a built in ladder fitted onto his '58 Kombi that rolled down from
underneath the rack.
