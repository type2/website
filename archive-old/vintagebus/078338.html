Subject: Re: fleetlines [VB] 10 digit serial number

&gt;I've seen some ads on the samaba for fleetlines recently, that were in
&gt;africa and they seem to be 74s or 75s, ya a 15 window '74 splitty in
&gt;south africa.

Even in my limited experience, some people don't know what year VW
they have.  A friend of mine swore up and down that he had a '64 Bus
until I pulled the passenger seat forward and pointed out the 265...
on his M code plate.  I think people mostly get confused about the
difference between build year and calendar year.  I have also heard
that back in the day, sometimes Buses got initially registered for
license plates as the wrong year, and that wrong number stuck.  Anyway,
it wouldn't surprise me if the &quot;'74&quot; Fleetlines are really model year
'75s built in calendar year '74.
