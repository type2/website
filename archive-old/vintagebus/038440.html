Hey yours is not the only list connection and tranny swap.

Clara is hosting me on the upgrade of my '63 to a 3.88 on Sunday.  A Todd
Hill custom build!  Finally won't have to hold 4th in all the time :)

  Renton, Washington
  Off to Olympia early early Sunday AM!

It seems that I will be &quot;hogging&quot; Kyles' time this weekend. We will be
configuring and installing the new Rancho 3.88 tranny that I bought from
Lake Havasu Ronnie &lt;ronnie_at_ctaz_dot_com&gt;. It will go into the 63 &quot;EZ&quot; camper.
The last of the parts arrived *just* in time this afternoon. Hooray =) 

Thanks to Ronnie- This long distance purchase was an easy and responsive
transaction! I can say without reservations that he went out of the way to
make it happen in a timely manner.
