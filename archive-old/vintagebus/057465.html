Subject: Re:Re: [VB] Westy Paint-Sikkens or Special Kolor

Hey, come on, there are normally oodles of threads that are far more redundant and boring than this one.  Your point is well taken, so don't think I'm in anyway taking offense to it, but I still feel the urge to respond to it.  I'm halfway through a double espresso and it's Friday.

I agree with you and Michael Heron about the poor German language thing.  That's why my orignal post indicated that I came to the conclusion during the resto of my '59 that it stood for Sikkens.  But Hazetguy Jon Furst got me thinking on it again.  There has to be some reason for using the abreviation.  I'm not losing sleep over it, but it is *interesting* (to some of us anyway).

Bottom line is all of this &quot;meaningless dribble&quot; that we consume ourselves with each and everyday about pressed bumpers, middle seats,spalsh pans, etc. really has very little bearing on World issues or how the planet spins.  A lot of it doesn't even have any bearing on the basic operation of one's Bus.  But it's a hobby (or livelihood) that we participate in and enjoy, so why not get caught up in the minutia from time to time.  If someone wants to spaz out about using original hardware (sorry David, but I owe you a couple) the he or she should knock themselves out.

Robert
