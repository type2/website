Good question... I've been trying to figure out what dealership originally
sold my double cab as well.  Who out there knows how to figure this out?

David


&gt;&gt;&gt;How big a distribution area did each port of entry have?  I mean, if my
bus
came into Jacksonville, could it have just as easily been sold in Mobile,
AL or Savannah, GA?  There's probly no way of figuring this out exactly, is
there?
