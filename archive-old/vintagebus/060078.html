Subject: Re: [VB] Dual circuit MC install review


&gt; Another warning is that the Bay disc/drum MC should not be used with a split
&gt; drum/drum setup.  Apparently the pressure check valve is not in the
&gt; disc/drum Bay MC like the single circuit or '67 unit.  I wonder if the
&gt; drum/drum 68-70 bay MC could be used easily as a drum/drum split bus
&gt; alternative though?  My opinion is that the '67 only MC is totally worth the
&gt; $150 or so it costs for the dual circuit in a drum/drum application.

The problem with the 68-70 MC is the two nipple holes.
67 only, 71-79, Rabbits, Volvos, MB, and just about all other dual masters are
85mm apart.
The 68-70 is 100mm from center to center. Unless you use the 69/70 upper and
lower reservoir, there is no other reservoir available with a screw cap on it
for 100mm masters. [as far as I know....]
The 68 upper and lower is one-year-only with a metal pipe between the two.
69/70 has a flexible plastic? tube.
