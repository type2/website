Subject: Re: [VB] Towing my 67

Hi Mike,
You have to make sure all four wheels and thier bearings and suspension are 
in good enough shape and tightened, to drive even when just towing.
  Kind of reminds us of a friend of our's a while back who had a low mileage, 
all OG paint, no dings let alone any dents, 1958 panel van for sale, with 
cracked OG tires from the factory.  It had been in storage for about 30 years 
before it was found by our friend!  He sold it and told the new owner who was 
going to move it to either tow it on a trailer or bring a set of good tires.  
Instead while our friend was out for the weekend, the new owner brought just a 
tow dolly and a couple of miles out of town one of the rear OG tires blew out.  
The panel flipped over three times and not much was left to salvage.
