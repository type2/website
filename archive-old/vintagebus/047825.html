That second pic shows the front though,
The difference is in the back.
That 56 and that 54 should have identicle belly pans.

&lt;&lt; I just happen to have these shots of a barndoor with belly pans and my
56 with belly pans that appear to be identical on both buses. On my 60
double door they were the same. Now anything later I don't know.

On the pans Lenny has. Tony Ochoa made them with people he knows in
Mexico and they weren't exactly to his liking so he is having better
ones made with thicker steel and deeper more original indentations. That
first batch was not as original as thought. If Tony is working on it
it's going to be right.
