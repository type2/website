&lt;&lt; It would be kewl to know what kind of buses and their conditions that we 
all
 on the list have, so if you feel so inclined post what you got.
 
 I have.... &gt;&gt;

59 15 window, lovely combination of rattle can paint and primer. Mostly black 
and tan. Was super low when I bought it, now its sits about 6 inches higher 
than stock on concrete blocks, waiting for me to finish por-15ing the 
underside so I can put in the suspension from the wrecked 67. anyone want 
some homebrew lowering stuff? gutted inside, but I am slowly finding the bits 
for it. got a nice og upolstery correct middle seat at good will for $3. Now 
I just need a front, rear and door panels.
    
63 dormobile. house paint. rear 1/4 from a 60 so its got old style wheel 
wells and vents on one side and newer style on the other. Three different vin 
numbers, but I did recently manage to get a title that matches one of them. 
plywood interior And a strange large square hole cut in the cargo floor. 
Bondo in every panel but the roof, recently started knocking and got put out 
behind the house. I love it anyway.

65 rv, most here are familiar with. I've &quot;sold&quot; this beast at least 4 times 
and it always falls through. Think I'm gonna put a type4 motor in it and 
drive it to shows where I stay overnight. but still for sale.

67 13 window deluxe. rust in the floors, but mostly  og  green paint. like 
the rest, it doesnt run either. also for sale.

68 single cab IT RUNS! daily run about and junk scrounging wagen. Though it 
is starting to pull to one side when I hit the brakes. some og paint and some 
crappy accident repair and flaking off paint. grinds into second sometimes. 
not to rusty.

71 camper. Runs. Unknown maufacture of camper kit but I've seen home brew 
that had a better design and fit. I picked this  bondo chunk of a bus up so I 
could put the tranny in my sc, and the engine in my dormobile. Will probably 
go to scrap this fall. 

most recently a 71 eriba puck, not really a bus but it looks neat towed 
behind one. doesn't have much to break.

Cutting up a 66 and 67 bus. need bits?
