Subject: Re: [VB] Re: Welding on Engine blocks

Inexperienced welding on a Type 1 magnesium engine case
will produce enough heat to ignite it, and you won't be able to put  the fire out.
This procedure requires master tig welding skills and the right equipment,
Save the case for your next big party.

Subject: [VB] Re: Welding on Engine blocks

&gt; I have seen people weld on engine cases for filling behind
&gt;cylinder 3 for large cc engine builds but has anyone welded a crack that
&gt;has started over 3? I am asking because I have a good running 1600dp
&gt;with a crack in the case and I am wondering if it can be fixed that way.
&gt;If so I have a mig welder with aluminum wire I would like to try. If it
&gt;doesn't work the case is already gone. Any thoughts
