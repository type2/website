 What years were these used?

they were used on high hinge doors.   I have only seen them on 61s with high 
hinge doors, maybe later 60.   I definately have seen 60s without them.   The 
doors that came with them have holes drilled in the appropriate place on the 
hinge.  They also use a rubber seal between the cover and the hinge.
