Coming from Orlando.  Haven't been to Tampa since I saw Led Zeppelin there
in 1973.  Don't even remember the drive there or back, I was driving an
ALMOST NEW 1971 VW Bus BTW.  I can remember it was running on 3 cylinders
and we were putt putting our way there.  But remembering how to get there
wouldn't help though, I was leaving from Miami back then ..

Diane [needing directions from I-4]

PS .. made another trip there in 1977, now that I think of it .. don't
remember THAT drive either .. that was the Led Zeppelin Riot show ... I
remember the riot though.
