There is an electrical outlet on the side of my westy cabinet facing the
right side cargo door. Has a chrome bezel on it and is wired to the vertical
wall light that goes to the battery. Just curious as to what was supposed to
plug in to it. Since it runs off of the battery, I guess it's not for a
window A/C unit. :)

Coo Coo for Cocoa Puffs,
