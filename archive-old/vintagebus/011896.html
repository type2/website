&gt; Nice meaty tread, decent load rating, easy availability.

&gt; Any input on my choice is appreciated.  I still have to get my rims
blasted

This size is smaller in diameter than stock, so your engine will run
4% faster at any given road speed.  That means that if your engine
normally runs 3600 RPM, it will have to run 3750 RPM with the new tires.

In this size, load range C is 1435 pounds capacity, which is lower
than the bus requirement of 1520 pounds.

Look a bit harder for proper-sized tires, you'll thank yourself in the
end!
