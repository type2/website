Subject: 6V starter bushing in 12V transmission

Okay I was able to find the bushings listed on line and would expect the
local Bug specialty shops to have one.  One thing that I didn't mention is
that I have a 12V flywheel and a 12V tranny housing.  Can I use the 6V
starter if I use the special bushing or is there a mismatch between the
flywheel and the starter gear?

Thanks,

Thomas

Yes there are conversion bushings available.Any COMPETENT shop should have
them.
