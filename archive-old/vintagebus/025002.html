Sorry you are wrong, it was used thru `60 on the bastard motors...same
air cleaner...I have a `60 Westfalia with 42,000 original miles bought
form original owner...bus is 99% original, only non-original parts are
the tires and battery.  Yup, stil has the original bastard engine, in
fact I have the recall papers for it too...the original owners never
took it in since it alwyas ran soo good!?

BUT,  The air cleaner is the same as 36 motors...maybe a differnt
sticker on it but that is it.  I have pictures and original owners
manual if you need proof.

See a picture of the bus at

&gt; Hi todd,
&gt; If that is a 36HP then it would be for 1959 1/2 on down.  The Bastard 40HP
&gt; 1959 1/2 -1960 had an air cleaner design that was half 36HP and half 40HP.
