Subject: Re: [T2] Dealer Microfiche machine value?

&gt; Anyone ever seen those old dealer microfiche machines for sale? A guy i know from work bought one from a
storage locker auction, which as usuall he prolly paid 20 bucks for or somethin for the whole locker. he
offered it up to me. He knows nothing about VW's, but tells me the fiche goes back to the 40s? I dunno bout
that, well see. He says it also has a bunch of newer stuff, scirocco, etc stuff. What should i offer him for
this? I looked in the archives and found a reference of 50 bucks for the machine itself from 2 years ago.

VW parts fiche are oversize and will not fit in regular readers.
VW service fiche are standard size.
Both fiche are made the opposite compared to other companies. They fade away very fast and show scratches very
easy. They are totally transparent with very light printing on them. Most others are solid color based with
the writing in white..
