Subject: Re: [VB] Stereo &amp; Generator ?

For about a year, I had 2 12's running on a 760 watt amp, 2 6x9's, and 2
5.25's in my bus being motivated by a Pioneer head unit running the stock
generator with new brushes.  I had no problems at all with dead batteries or
anything.  I am thinking, however, that it did fry my headlight relay, my
turn signal relay, and my voltage regulator...

&gt; what kind of radios do y'all have running on your stock 12V buses?
&gt;
&gt; thanks!
