I have similar propblems with my bus. Although I haven't had a fan belt break
on me.

Last august I bought the bus, the PO told me that the starter doesn't work
100% of the time. He said the solenoid was on its way out, and he gave me a
new solenoid with the bus. He said if the bus has trouble starting, go
underneath, and short the solenoid, the bus will sound as if it is turning
over. This somehow helps(not sure why) then go back up front and turn the
engine over.

So I had the bus for a couple weeks before I had any problems, when I did
eventually have problems, I tried this method, and the thing started right
away.

eventually I had to crawl under the bus every time, so I put a new solenoid
in, and it worked fine until a couple of weeks ago. Now I am having to crawl
under the bus more and more frequently.

So I am guessing that the solenoid he gave me as new was actually not new.

Any way, try shorting the solenoid a la Muir, and see if it works. If so, it
sounds like you need a  new solenoid.

ps this applies if you are gettiung nothing from turning the key, except dash
lights. ie if your dash lights and headlights work but the bus doesn't make
any noise when you turn the key, then your battery is probably fine, the
problems lies in the starter assembly.

good luck
