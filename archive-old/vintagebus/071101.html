Subject: Re: [VB] Tire size question

Someone mentioned that 205/70r14's are the closest to stock size.

In my Bently, it states a 25.8&quot; diameter tire is stock, while a 205/70r14 is
only 25.3&quot;.
A 195/75r14 measures 25.5&quot; diameter, which is closer to stock.

If you can find them, 185sr14's (80-81 aspect ratio) are the same diameter
as stock, but I would run either the 195/75 or the 205/70's for better
stability on the highway when it is windy or large trucks pass by. Just my
opinion.
