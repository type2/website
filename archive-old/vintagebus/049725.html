I had a delightful weekend.  Dave Jersey came down from Charleston on
Firday and he and I hung out and and went to a Bluegrass Festival on
Saturday.  We had a great time.  The music floated on the breeze like
oversexed lightnin' bugs in a whirlwind.  Not only was the stage active
with pickin' but so was the campground.  Pockets of players plucked,
picked, and plowed their way through bluegrass tune after bluegrass tune.

The legacy of Bill Monroe, Earnest Tubb, and others was as thick as cold
syrup as tenor twang songs rolled from the players tongue.  It was a fine
sight to see and an even more pleasant one to hear.

Dave and I pulled in Saturday mid afternoon and happened to set up by a guy
that owns a 59 split bus.  He didn't know anything at all about the type2
list, but was extrememly interested.  Strangely enough his name was Charles
David Cagle.  There we were a Charles, a David, and a Charles David.  Wierd
eh?

The folks were friendly and didn't even flinch at the site of our busses
pulling in through the gate.  We were welcomed with open arms and smiles.
Many folks came over to our units and said stuff like &quot;Hey, we used to own
one of these damn things.  Drove the son of a bitch everywhere.  Loved it
too!&quot;  .

I spoke with the owner of the campground to see if I could set up a campout
at the next one at the end of April 2000. The Pineywoods Bluegrass Bus
Festivall will be held at the Pineywoods Campground in conjunction with the
Pineywoods Bluegrass festival.

The owner has said that we could have our own area for camping and the cost
would be $10.00 for electric hookup, and $5.00 primitive.  There is a 22
acre lake that has fish in it and canoes are welcomed.  The facilities are
great except there are no trees to speak of.  I wouldn't want to camp there
in the summer at all.

Most of the crowd that shows up to this festival is senior citizens so
mannerly behavior will be required.  We want to bridge the gap, not drive a
wedge in it + I want to try and make it an annual event.

I want to offer an event that will inspire and open the mind to a new
experience.  I think Bluegrass is an unappreciated American music style and
it is mostly because folks have never listened to it.  It is honestly
relaxing music.  If ya don't believe me come to the campout....I am going
to do a warm up gathering in December so come one come all.

Keep watching for details.  The Pineywoods Bluegrass Bus Festival will be
coming soon.

I enjoyed the weekend Brother Dave.

Thanks for tolerating the ramblings,
Charlie Ford
