Subject: RE: [VB] Engine woes

Jim,

I've experienced this a few times over the years, sounds like a fuel
delivery issue. Rusty or bad gas clogging fuel filter would be my 1st guess,
then possible fuel pump issue at extended rpms.
Good Luck,
Gary

everyone up north, it feels like a fuel line about the freeze up).  The car
will be cruising along greatly, then suddenly get these spurts of lost
power, jerking. '
