&gt;Friday nite went out to dinner and the bus did alright, on the way home 
&gt;supper slugish loss of power and the outside temp was probably 50 degrees 
&gt;(I'm in SC).

Adjust your choke.  Let the Bus sit all night in its usual condition
(if you park it inside, leave it inside, etc).  First thing in the AM,
*don't start the engine or even turn on the key*, and go to back.
Pull your air cleaner off and loosen the three screws holding the
choke cover down (the round thing, usually on the right side, with
a wire going to it).  Pull the throttle lever back with your left
index finger so it is well clear of the fast idle cam and start turning
the choke cover back and forth with your right hand.  You should find
that one way opens the choke (that round plate in the top of the carb)
and the other way closes it.  (If it sticks, take the choke cover
completely off and hose down inside there and around the choke plate
with spray carb cleaner.)  Move the cover to where the choke just barely
closes and no further, and tighten the choke cover screws.  Put the
air cleaner back on and go up front to start it.  Come back and make
sure you have voltage (use your test light) between the electric
terminal on the choke cover and ground.  If no voltage, find out why...
probably a broken wire either at the choke cover or over at the coil
(this wire is hot with key on).

You may find you have to readjust the fast idle with the screw in
the end of the throttle arm after doing this.

Also, don't forget to readjust when the weather changes significantly.

Good luck!
