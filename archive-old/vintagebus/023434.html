I see you haven't had many responses to this one...

You didn't mention replacing the rubber flexible lines...

How are your drums?  Do they rub in one spot when you adjust and do a full
turn?

I have the same problem with bubbles on my '63 single circuit.  I still need
to work on it.

Thank you guys (and gals) I have recurring brake Probs
on the ol panel. This time, the left side brakes have a 
a tendency to lock up way before the right side does. I have
rebuilt the four wheel cylinders up front, replaced the master
cylinder (single circuit), replaced the rear cylinders, bled
the lines, checked for leaks, prayed towards wolfsburg, nothing
seems to work. The only wierd thing is that when the pedal comes
back up, there appears to be small bubbles in the reservoir.
So, if anybody out there has an idea as to how to solve this 
prob, PLEASE let me know. Oh yeah, the second wierd thing is that 
after I drive Idalou for a while, the Brakes even out and the problems 
are gone.(after about 10-15 minutes) Thanks in advance!
