The guy is probably in the business of selling VW parts.  He sold you a pair and
now has another to sell. You met his reserve, so reselling the same item to try
and get a higher price is not the issue.  Also, its not like he's selling a one
of a kind rare item that he'd have sellers remourse over.   I looked at his
feedback and in the last 6 months and 312 transactions, there is only one
negative comment.  I didn't feel like wading through the 41 pages of responses
to see what the negative comment was about.  Just email the guy and let him know
you are anxious to get him the money.
