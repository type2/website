I had a 65 Dodge flower van, 3 on the tree 170 CID, that reeked of the burnt
bud. Had to get rid of it, no amount of mirror hanging green trees would cover
it up. Quite frankly, I think that's what they used for insulation in the
walls, shades of Cheech &amp; Chong. Funny, didn't see any VW emblems on it
anywhere. Must have missed it.

I'm calling it quits on this thread. Chiming back in when real dub talk
occurs.

What is a &quot;VW&quot; Hippy? I admitedly wasn't there, it was before my time, but
weren't VW's new cars then? When did the VW &quot;tye&quot; start? From the pics I have
seen and other various media most &quot;hippies&quot; had other cars, like old amercian
cars and school buses. I'm not saying that they weren't around but why don't
Ford Econoline vans have the same rep?
