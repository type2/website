Subject: Re: Repro taillights.

&gt;WW has those repro taillights... are they good?

I have a repro taillight (large oval style) on the passenger side of
my '64 and it works OK.  Not sure if it's from WW though.  Comparing
it to the '66 tail light on the left side: The '66 has a cast plate
and stamped reflector.  The repro is all stamped.  The '66 has its
socket mounted to the reflector with tabs only.  The repro has the
socket mounted with tabs and gray expoxy.  The '66 has a VW logo and
SWF stamped in the lens retaining ring and the repro does not.  The
gasket on the outside of the Bus is not as thick on the repro as on
the '66.  The '66 has faded silver paint inside the reflector and
the repro is chromed - much shinier.  Both lights have a push-on for
a ground wire.

Both lights seem to work pretty well.  The fresh chrome on the
reflector of the repro does make it a little brighter.

&gt;if there is a light, it's suppose to work... am I the only one?

No.  On a Bus, there is 12 candlepower of light (about 17 watts)
between you and the guy behind you in the Escalade who is shaving,
talking on the cell phone, and watching TV, so it is a good idea
to make sure they are all working well.
