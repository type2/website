Just a lame correction from the accountant...
It is the State Board of Equalization governs the sales tax department.  Any
number that  a seller would have would be there, and they would only have a
number if they are a reseller, meaning, if their business is to sell parts.
BTW, a private sale is not subject to tax, however, St. Board may require a
license if someone practices the same type of private sale.  They even have
rules on how many garage/yard sales you can have in a year.
