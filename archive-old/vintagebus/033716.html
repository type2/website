   Just have finished a wonderful visit from the other Everett (Reins) that
is. He and his wife stopped through on there way back to Illinois. He was
the one with the trans popping out of 4th, well he got an extra trans from
me, so he shouldn't have any troubles now that he's carrying a spare. They
will be cruising the old route 66 then up to the Grand Canyon, from there
maybe up through Colorado then I 70 home, so any of you out there keep your
eyes peeled for a beautiful 66 pop top camper out there on the highway.


Ronnie  another listy's trip updated.
