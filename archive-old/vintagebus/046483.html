&lt;&lt; But Jerome is once a YEAR.  Everybody knows when and where it is.  It's not
 like it's a surprise, all-of-a-sudden, &quot;Whoa!  There's a show!&quot;
 
 You have 365 days to get a bus together for the trip, minus travel time
 from your destination.  
 
 Why does it have to be an episode of &quot;Junkyard Wars?&quot;

 &gt;everyone to get together beforehand and help out to get a few busses road

er....  I too have felt the &quot; this event is coming up and I want to get sh%* 
done to my bus in time for it&quot; feeling.   just gives a bit of a kick in the 
butt.     It got me to do some stuff to my 53 before Vintage Meet.  Then 
again there are so many shows in the sac area it must not be a big deal.
