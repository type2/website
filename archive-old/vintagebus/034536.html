my idea of good customer service is that the people are friendly professional,
and know what they are talking about.      If they make a mistake (everyone
does, hey, don't be too anal)  making it right by exchanging the part or
whatever.   Sending stuff promptly is nice, too.

bad customer service includes:

making fun of me cause they don't know the vehicle enough to understand the
parts I am talking about.

telling me a part is better cause it is &quot;made of Xeron- from the planet Xeron
&quot;  (get a life, you fruit cake)

being a jerk

being nice, but selling the wrong part and insisting it is the right one.

complaining when I disassemble and inspect brake cylinders before paying (I
have bought some which were missing parts, and otherwise being incorrect, I do
this as just making sure)

Hauling away the wrong bus, and then insisting grey is blue.

Talking over my shoulder to my boyfriend, who was not talking to the guy at
the desk, but staring at the walls.  (It's a guy thing, I guess)

Being condescending (yes I do know what year my bus is.  duh.)

Sleeziness (get away from me you pervert)

charging over the agreed price.

I am sure everyone is a nice guy, but also everyone has bad days or whatever.
Unfortunately,  I remember the bad stuff in more detail.   

I think it is good to give feedback on this list.    We all are trying to keep
our ancient buses going, or get them going, and it is great to learn from
others where to go and not to go for parts/help.    I have definately been one
of those people who bugs people for info without buying much,  maybe I am
trying to give back to others some of the stuff I learned on this list.    And
people were very patient and helpful, for which I am eternally grateful, or
else I would probably have been dissuaded from VWs, and you all would not be
subjected to me droning on endlessly about part numbers, wire colours, and the
feet on my bus, which I am convinced is neccessary to your metal health.    I
hope just cause someone is a jerk once, that everyone doesn't blacklist him,
but if I keep hearing the same thing from a number of people, I start to
listen.   Hey, cheat me once, shame on you, cheat me twice, shame on me for
trusting you.   But I have managed to get useful information and help even
from jerks.

Standard disclaimer:
The above is my own personal biased opinion.    Regard it as such.    I read
what others write with the thought in mind that it is their own
experience/opinion and may, or may not apply to my life, and is thusly taken
with a grain or salt.
