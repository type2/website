&lt;&lt; Why should I wait until AFTER it is dry and cracked?  Could I do this to 
my NOS floormats BEFORE they get dry and cracked? &gt;&gt;
Hi Paul,
Yes!  Best to do it that way if you want vynil, plastic, and rubber to last 
much longer.  Proactive maintenance is always much better than reactive!   
60ish and later sunvisors, head liners, and all years of rubber floor mats 
will be much happier.  We have heard of rose scented glycerin that you could 
even use to keep things supple and even smelling good.   Eric&amp;Barb
