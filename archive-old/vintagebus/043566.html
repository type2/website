Subject: Druecken meine Selbst-H1-Schalter (Color Barndoor wiring diagram)

Or, blowing my own horn.  :)

On a snowy day when it was too cold to work on the Bus, even in the
Garage, I suddenly started channeling for Ted Turner.  I was moved
to colorize the black and white Barndoor wiring diagram that Thom
has graciously provided on vintagebus_dot_com .  You can see the results
for yourself at http://www.vintagebus_dot_com/wiring/bus-53-color.jpg .
I checked it over a few times, but please let me know if you find
any misteaks on it, or any other comments.

For the curious: I did the diagram (including stripes) with xpaint, 
http://home.worldonline.dk/~torsten/xpaint .  I also used the GIMP
http://www.gimp_dot_org and ImageMagick http://www.imagemagick_dot_org .
These last two will run on Winblows but as far as I can tell,
the only way to get xpaint to run on Winblows is to reformat and
install Linux or *BSD, a process which may lose data.  :)

Enjoy!
