We have been on base for years and this sounds about right
P &amp; C
But Philip never got off with a warning

 From: Chuck &amp; Jan Covington 
 I hear ya.  I was doing 55 in a 35 on base (air force) an the Security
pulled me over and while he was walking up to my truck I saw
&gt; him laughing at my stickers which read &quot;Too slow, too bad&quot; and &quot;Fast
&gt; cars suck&quot;.  He made a comment about my stickers and I laid into him
&gt; saying &quot;Do you know how long it took me to get going this fast?  How
&gt; dare you make me stop&quot;.  He let me off with a warning.
