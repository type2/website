No.  Hight temp paint is neither required or desirable.  I use ordinary
rattle-can paint with excellent results.  Remember that OEM paint on
the tin is hardly show-quality.

If your tin has orignal OEM markings, such as the engine M-code, it's a
good idea to photograph them before painting.  Even if you aren't a
vintage nazi, you might use the data later on.
