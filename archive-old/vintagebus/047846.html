Sorry of it seem like I'm Pimping the Bus Depot. But Ron is having a problem
we would all love to have. From what he has told me he's growing fast (it's
because of his price's and service). but is having a hard time finding good
help. Hang with him he's a good VW guy trying to do the right thing. I bought
most of the resto stuff for my 66 from him and saved a lot of $$.
