Been searchin for a while &amp; cant find any info on a
cover for my truck. A few pics but no technical stuff.
What im lookin for is pics of the assembly in the
disassembled state. Dimentions, how the hoops
installed in the bed, and how the tarp was secured to
the truck, ect... Anyone got any lit, pics, info.....
Please pmail... very little bus content
Thanks all,
