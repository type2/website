   The original delivery date of the EMPI bus has been pushed back a few
weeks, they should be here within a month or 2.  I do have 5 of the standard
wheel ones available at this time. I got a small shipment of them before the
Classic for my long distance customers that came out to the Classic and have
a few left. If anybody out there can't wait till the full shipment arrives
let me know. They will cost $15.00 dollars each (because I only got a
limited number) plus whatever the US postal service gets for standard mail
shipment. I have to limit it to 1 per person, as I only have 5 at this time.
Be the first to own this beauty. From what I've been told were only 100
available till the full shipment arrives.

PLEASE CALL   520  680- 7664
M/C Visa will  ship today

Ronnie    I will post to the list again when gone
