&gt;Just recieved my new AutoMeter tach, will install in my bus this week and 
&gt;see what my R's are at what indicated speed and gear, this way we'll all 
&gt;know  what rpm's the 3.88/77 4th gear, big nut trans with 195/14 tires is, 
&gt;for those that care.
&gt;
&gt;ronnie

speaking of which... i think i toasted my engine cuz of my small nut. it 
seems to be leaking oil everywhere. around cylinders, push rods, everywhere! 
seems to be a big power loss too. im sooooo bummed. i finished painting it 
the tuesday before last, drove it in my wedding that saturday and while i 
was on my honeymoon it took a sh#t. :( i guess i knew cruising at ~4500rpm 
would do something.

is there any way to know if a tranny is any good out of the vehicle? my big 
nut from my other '66 seemed ok, it grinded downshifting into second though. 
i wouldnt want to put it in and have to take it right back out.

*sigh*
