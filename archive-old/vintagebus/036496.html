&lt;&lt; I have been having trouble getting the drivers side cylinders (1&amp;3 I 
think) to run very well. At idle I pull the plug wires for 2&amp;4 and there is a 
huge drop, I pull 1&amp;3 and almost nothing. When I go to put 1or3 back on there 
is a quick surge and then back to nothing. &gt;&gt;
Hi Craig,
Huh?!  #1 &amp; 2 cylinders are on the right (USA passenger side.) and #3 &amp; 4 are 
on the left (USA driver side.) side of the engine.  So we are going to guess 
you have your cylinder numbers mixed up.  If so it sounds like you have too 
big of pilot (Idle), and/or main jets.  What color are the sparkplugs on the 
bad carb side?  Are they wet with fuel?  Did you formerly have these carbs on 
running engine?  We recently came across a new pilot jet that had not been 
fully threaded which did not allow it to fully seal into place and allow fuel 
to flow right on by it flooding out a cylinder on a 356A Porshe.  Eric&amp;Barb
