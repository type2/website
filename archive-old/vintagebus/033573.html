Subject: Getting the 57!!!
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

Heres the plan:

Finalize the deal tomorrow and tuesday.  Drive to $#%_at_(#&amp;$, CA (the location) 
and load it into the trailer.  Haul it home and tear it apart.  Sounds like a 
pretty sweet deal, 4k for a solid ribbed bumper 15 window.  Have two 36 hp 
getting ready.  This will be my first deluxe and Im very excited.  If anyone 
has any tips as for the disassembly, packing and labeling like what parts to 
store in a safe let me know.  This is going to be a wonderful learning 
experience.  By the way its Chestnut brown over Sealing wax red.
