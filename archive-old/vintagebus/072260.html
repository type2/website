Subject: Re: [VB] Eberspacher BN-4 troubleshooting question

Try flicking the reset switch on the side of the heater.   Then will it work? 
    if it does, don't touch the heat control agian, just the on/off switch.


if the fuel pump is bad, the blower fan should still work.   It would be odd 
that both stop working at once.
