I am panelling the inside of my panel.  I had started making my own
pieces, then the local guy here who makes repro panels finally came thru
and made me a set.  They will cover all of the exposed metal except the
bulkhead.  It's made out of thin pressboard material.

&gt; Hey everyone--
&gt; Any creative people have some good ideas of what I should do w/ the interior 
&gt; of my restored '59 panel? I had a SO-42 westy interior that I was gonna use, 
&gt; but it was for a wide hatch bus so I sold it to someone who needed it for 
&gt; their westy... 
&gt; Right now it's grey metal (stock), but I want to have something a bit more 
&gt; user friendly which looks Really nice to compliment the rest of the bus!
&gt; This may be a bit off topic, but i'd love some ideas!!!
