A funny thing.  When I had a walk-thru and living in it for almost two
years, traveling the Northwest,  man it was the best,  but I was looking to
build a jump-seat in the walkway.  Now I've got a  bench seat and man I love
the close-up driving with my arm around my honey,  but I'm thinking where's
the isle man.  Now I just try not to find fault with whatever I've got cause
it can go in a heart beat like when my walk-thru burnt to the ground.  I'm
just thankful I was able to find another bus.
