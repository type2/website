Subject: Re: [VB] redux box adapter kit...

 I really believe its more of a suspension setup than an areodynamic one:) 
when the front dives into a corner, the rear tire opposite the corner will 
come plum off the ground. Like when your out in the woods cuttin firewood, ya 
really gotta look out for stump sink holes, right front tire falls in to the 
hole, left rear will be hangin in the air! 
 By the way... in the SC, a high speed corner consist of 45-50 mph in 3rd.  
we cant all have a Porsche:)
