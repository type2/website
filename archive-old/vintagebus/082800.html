Subject: Re: [T2] Help BusDepot Donate to Tsunami Victims

this is from Bus Depot
I'm sure that by now most of you have heard of the tsunamis/earthquake in
Asia that have killed more than 23,000 people so far &lt;&lt; we know its 4x that 
now

The Bus Depot has always donated a portion of our profits to humanitarian
charities on an ongoing basis. (See http://busdepot_dot_com/help.jsp#DONATIONS
.)  But I feel that the severity of this disaster demands special attention.


So from now until New Years, 25 percent of the net profits of BusDepot_dot_com
sales will be donated to Doctors Without Borders, to provide medical relief
for the victims of this tragedy.

  My Part, I have to make an order for about $900 to a $1000 in bus parts, 
meaning ur to $250 in donations from them.

I was going to order from Schofield in the UK knowing that there quality is 
up to my standards. 
I need floor sections, battery boxes, dog legs door bottoms for a 63 21 
window, 67 deluxe and 65 deluxe, Can I expect a quality I will be happy with from 
them and still help out the victims. 
You have to understand I als have to make my customers happy.

So I guess I'm asking if you have restored a bus where you real happy with 
their quality?
