Subject: FS: 1964 Westfalia     :(

Circumstances beyond my control are forcing me to sell my project. I
have pics available. If you want the pics please tell me if you want
seperate jpgs or 1 animated gif showing all the pictures. Please feel
free to ask me any question about the bus. Thanks.



1964 Westfalia Camper Bus

This bus is an excellent canidate for restoration. I am really sad that
I *have*
to sell this one.
400 miles on new 1600dp. Balanced, runs super well!!
1967 Tranny. This has a taller 4th gear allowing higher speeds.
Converted to 12 volt. The 12 volt gas guage works, as well as all of the

lighting (even the interior lights!).
I bought it in OKC, which is about a 4 hour drive from here. I did 70-75
mph
all the way home without any problems                .
It has the jumpseat, cooler/water combo/ rear folding bed and all of the

cabnits.
The bus needs passenger seat, drivers seat needs redone, front door/kick

panels are decimated.
Left rocker has some bondo, nose is pushed in (It comes with another
nose
peice), right side wheel arch has bondo, the floor by the doors is the
worst
part. The underneath has surface rust but no cancer that I can see.
Since it has been sitting the rear brake cylinders have gone south. If
you came
to buy it and needed to drive it away, I would help you install new
ones. You
buy the parts.

Included with the bus are 2 very straight bumpers with overrides, lots
of
WCM rubber, 4 new hubcaps, and many other misc. parts.

This bus could very easily be a daily driver, or an excellent canidate
for
restoration.

$950 will get you this camper and all the extra parts
