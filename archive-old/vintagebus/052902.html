Subject: sun visor

Howdy all. The driver's side sun visor on my '62 Crew cab finally gave out on me. The plastic triangular plastic piece that screws to the body broke. I was wondering if I can just replace that bracket, or if I have to replace the whole thing. Also, this is a driver, nothing near a restoration, so if other incorrect years would fit, that would be fine also. I just want to have one for those lovely afternoons riding off into the sunset...
Any info/sources appreciated.
Thanks, and Happy Holidays
