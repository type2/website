Just buy the darn thing. If you get a good deal, the only thing I would
worry about is a repeat offense. You being hauled off and dumped,only to
leave your neat bus for some axe yielding murderer should be your only
concern. That and rust!  Anyway, good luck....

Subject: [VB] An interesting bus story...


&gt; Lillian Meisenbach was a healthy 83 year old woman - alert, sharp as a
tack,
&gt; and a very wealthy woman from playing her cards right through life.  She
&gt; lived 2 and 1/2 blocks from me and would often give me glaring looks as I
&gt; sped by on my chainsaw sounding moped or bug on my way to work in the
&gt; mornings.  She would often be outside doing old people things like old
&gt; people like to do that early in the morning like sweeping the sidewalk or
&gt; watering her lawn.  She never returned my smiles and waves but that's
okay.
&gt; Lillian had been missing since February 6th and yesterday morning, a
farmer
&gt; 13 miles north of here was walking his dog down a dirt road and when he
&gt; crossed the bridge, there she lay face down in the creek bed - fodder for
&gt; the coyotes.  The blood stains found on the red interior of her rental car
&gt; pointed to foul play from the start.  Beatrice Nebraska's first murder in
&gt; over 12 years.
&gt;
&gt; This evening, I got a call from Judith Noah who works for the Sherrif's
&gt; Dept. in Falls City, NE.  She's got a worn and slightly rusty 1967 bus for
&gt; sale that in all respects is in good shape for it's Midwestern age.  We
&gt; talked at length about her bus - she knows what she has and I so do I.
It's
&gt; a bus that can be a runner with very little work.  She parked it because
she
&gt; couldn't find the gears and 40 miles after having the clutch replaced, it
&gt; started having the trouble again so it's been parked outside for over 3
&gt; years now.  The tires are sunk in the ground, engine bay is really clean,
&gt; and it appears that very little work would be needed to make it a runner.
&gt; It's painted white over red (my favourite color setup too!)  So now I'm
torn
&gt; between getting my old white POS 66 going (I'm so close), or attempting to
&gt; get this bus (with it's better body) and getting it going.  I know the
&gt; rust-free nature of this bus is going to save me a lot of money in the
&gt; future and if you could only see the undercarriage of my 66, you'd
probably
&gt; say to go with the 67.  But why is this bus in such good shape?  Judith
told
&gt; me the following story:
&gt;
&gt; &quot;My dad worked on Volkswagens for years but he eventually lost interest.
&gt; Dad had heard of some real nice VWs coming up on an estate sale in
Missouri
&gt; so he went to the sale and bought the bus which was in really good shape.
&gt; The previous owner cherished his VWs and really kept them up well.
&gt; Unfortunately, he was murdered and his body was hauled away in this bus
and
&gt; dumped.  The bus was used in a murder but I've camped in it and there is
&gt; nothing weird like ghosties or anything like that.&quot;
&gt;
&gt; Now I'm not superstitious and I have strong religeous views on the
&gt; supernatural so it shouldn't really bother me but riding in a hearse is
bad
&gt; enough - more or less a bus that is known to have been involved in a
murder.
&gt; And with Lillian gone - man - what karma and vibes I had felt were just
&gt; about destroyed.  Despite all of this, I'm still running over to Falls
City
&gt; to inspect the cargo floor and meet Judith in person.  If the deal doesn't
&gt; go thru, I'll post her info because the bus is available - just make an
&gt; offer she says (the antique dealer in her - which she is.)
&gt;
&gt; I'd appreciate hearing any comments/opinions on this - what a werid crazy
&gt; situation...
