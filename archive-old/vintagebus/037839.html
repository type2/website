&gt; What I was thinking about was putting a nice solid metal grab handle (like the off-roaders use) on the frame above the passenger door (about where your hand would be if you held your arm out in front of you with your elbow bent up at 90 degrees).
&gt;
It would cool to mount one of those metal grab handles that were in the passenger area of '58-era Deluxes and on the dashes of non-Deluxe Barndoors.  I've seen them for about $20 at shows.  Nice correct-era VW part put to a new use.

The ends are cast aluminum, I guess they could potentially snap under extreme acceleration. 

It should fit in the location you described or, optionally, on the dash as a grab handle.
