Subject: Stub axle lock 'nut'?
Date: Mon, 10 Jul 2000 14:10:29 +0200

Hi list,

I want to replace the irritating two nuts and a lock washer arrangement on
my front stub axles with the later cleverer one piece thingy that locks with
an allen key. I've been told that part no: 211 405 669 670 will do the trick
for my '60 Dcab with the stock but squeaky front suspension.

Anyone know if this is the case?

TIA

Michael
