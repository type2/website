In a message dated 98-12-14 01:31:31 EST, you write:

&lt;&lt; I have a problem with my 66 westy, it has a broken door hinge.  It is the
part of the hinge that appears to be reveted onto the door. Can those revets
be removed and replaced with an luck? This is on the drivers door and i must
fix it. Can someone please help? I can't wait to get this thing going. I am in
the process of replacing all the the brake system and the door will be next.
&gt;&gt;
Hi Tommy &amp; Lisa,
You can either weld the hinge if it is not too close to the pin or drill out
the rivets and install a new/used hinge with screws with the proper
countersink to fit on the outside of the door and double nuts on the inside.
Good to hear that you are doing the brakes.  If the it will not roll, steer,
or stop properly any car is a death machine and because of this a running
engine is far less important.            Eric &amp; Barb
