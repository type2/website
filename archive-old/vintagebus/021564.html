I'm documenting the best I can. I often forget to take the camera with me as
I work.  As I've said before taking your time with it makes all the
difference.  Good luck on your project.
doug
&gt;  So are you documenting what you are going through with pictures and text.

&gt;  It would be wonderful to add to the Vintage site for newbies to this as 
&gt;  perhaps to vets as well.  We could add experience note to what you have!!
I 
&gt;  for one am going to be doing this to my Bus (currently doing a Bug) and
more 
&gt;  info is better.  Staffan
