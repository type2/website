Subject: VW NOS spark plugs!
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

Hi Volks,
We just picked up a pack of ten VOA packaged Bosch made spark plugs at a VW 
Porsche meet near McMinnville Oregon last weekend.  Problem is that the part 
number on them does not show up in any of the parts books we have here.  Does 
anyone out there have the info to what the part # ZVP 121 225 is supposed to 
fit?   Thanks, Eric&amp;Barb
