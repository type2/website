&lt;&lt; What's the most likely candidate here?  Regulator?  Generator? &gt;&gt;
Hi Chris,
First off always when loss of electrical power occurs take off the battery 
cables from the posts to baking soda water mixture the post and clamps clean 
of acid and then wire brush them clean.  Keep the baking soda water mixture 
away and out of any of the battery cells.  While this all is apart remove the 
battery and make sure to refill with only distilled water the cells of the 
battery if you have a unsealed battery.  Also a good idea to remove the 
ground cable from the body and clean the connecting areas there.  Repeat this 
at least twice a year, once in the late spring and in the early fall will 
help prevent dead battery problems especially in the fall/winter time due to 
bad connections at the battery!
  It is interesting to see every year the numbers of autos on the highway 
suddenly are parked broken down in the fall and late spring when the day to 
day weather pattern changes.  In the late spring the temps have risen and 
cooling systems that had been border line in effectiveness suddenly can not 
cope with the increase in outside temps resulting in blown radiators and/or 
hoses.  In the fall the sudden drop in outside temps allow the battery 
clamp/s already dirty with corrosion and acid deposts loosen and allow the 
battery to discharge and not keep the regulator in contact to keep the 
battery fully or at all charged up.   Eric&amp;Barb
PS While you have the battery out take measurements of the battery length and 
width and ASAP buy a battery box to fit properly.  You do not need the lid 
and can cut down the box sides so they do not interfer with the battery 
cables.  The box will capture acid sweated out of the vents and dripping down 
the sides of the battery, preventing so much corrosion in the battery tray 
and left rear corner of your bus.  Do not use those FLAPS chemical under 
battery pads in Bus and Ghia.  Both of these VWs due to the battery being in 
the engine compartment which allows water to rinse the baking soda out of the 
pad.  Results in no time the pad fills with the battery acid and becomes an 
even bigger corrosion problem than ever before!   EEE&amp;B
