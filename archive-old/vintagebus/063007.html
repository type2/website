thanks for the tip-that makes sense. i almost went to wash them, and
probably would have already, but I was waiting for the temp to go back up,
so they could dry in the sun.

I remember someone saying he cleaned the frame, and then they squeeked
horribly every time you sat down or there was a bump.   Implying that the
greasey stuff is supposed to be there.
