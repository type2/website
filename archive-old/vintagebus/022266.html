My guess would be that you are getting 2195.12 revolutions per minute. The
way I get this is that if you are going 60 mph then you are traveling 1
mile or 5250 feet in a minute. Times this by 12 inches in a feet and you
are going 63000 inches in a minute. Divde 63000 by the diameter of your
wheel and you get 2195.12. I would venture to guess that this is your rpm.

&gt;Anyone have a 14&quot; rim for sale for our '65 Westy? Two would even be better,
&gt;our spare is bent, and i want to take an extra spare for our trip to
&gt;Newfoundland. We are going to run the 225-85R-14LT tires, 28.7&quot; diameter.
&gt;Any of you math wiz's out there that can tell you our rpm at 60mph?
&gt;thanks, Jim
