I don't mind the term Barndoor but I was thinking about how that large hatch
opens up on the back and how similiar it is to an old style garage door
(from the 50's) with the large panel that swings up and in.  I actually see
no problem with calling it Barndoor because we know what it means so it's
like our own private lingo.  For those not in the know, we could simply
refer to them as large rear hatch buses or some overly descriptive term to
clue them in...
