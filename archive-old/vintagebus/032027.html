Hi Pat,
It always is better to find shops in your own area for large items like
trannys and engines.  That way if there is a problem later, the shipping that
would really add up, can be avoided due to shopping locally.  Now the question
is where are you located?  So volks near you can suggest shops they know they
can trust.     Eric &amp; Barb
