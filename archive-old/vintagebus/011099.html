Hooray for sorting the Judson out, her it is pretty tricky.

I recommend doing a tune up.   And take compressionn readings.   How hot did 
it get?  

Never ran a supercharger, but hear they reduce the life of the motor 
significantly. (even if correctly and completely installed)

Have a 36hp in my 53, original trans (has 6.00-15s on bug rims), and it 
cruises 50 easily, will cruise 55-60, but It seems that 50 is about 3700rpms 
and listed as recommended top/cruising speed, so in order not to prematurely 
ill the motor  which is pricier to redo than a 1600 I drive it slow.  Its not 
my daily driver anyway, so I dont get mad at driving slow.  It really is not 
a autobahn bus.

I did install a  (dated 56)  6V VDO dipstick temp guage in it, and it is 
interesting to see how the temp fluctuates with how fast I am driving (50 is 
hotter than 45), so take hwy 99 instead of I 5  to have a slower road.
