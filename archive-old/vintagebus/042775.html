Sometimes core charges are a game... Call them and ask what they buy cores
for outright.

I have seen places say they charge $500 for cores on certain things and i
call to offer to sell them the same part, and they say, oh we buy em for
$20, but we dont need any right now. The inflated core only applies to
rebuilds.

So, core charge on a rebuilt part doesnt neccecarily reflect market price
(but sometimes it does, wolfgang will pay cash for a lot of core type
stuff..)

take care,

Steve
