  Do to the lack of German 3.88 r/p we have been playing with some new gearing in transmissions. The 4.12 r/p with 
the 82 4th is basicaly what a 67 bus with rgb's would have come with. We have taken this one step further now and 
are using a 77 4th gear to replace the 82 (same price for either gear) being that 82 4th gears are getting harder to 
find now. We are also changeing the 3rd gear from a 1.31 to a 1.21. What this has done is stretch 3rd gear a little 
longer to make the drop from 3 to 4 less. You can also pull 3rd gear a little longer.
   If and when they ever make 3.44 r/p again that will be the best. With the 3.44 r/p you can pull all gears further, 
make the drop between gears less and have a higher top end with out the load on the engine (stock 1600). You can 
cruise up a hill in 3rd at 50/55 without a problem and cruise easily at 65-70 with out a strain on the engine.
  I have been working on different gear ratio's for over 8 years now and have no 2 buses with the same gear ratios as 
I strive to find the best combination for the money.
   My latest forray is a 3.88 with a 1.21 3rd and a 89 4th. This is going in a straight axle conversion bus and should 
make crusing at 75 a breeze.
    I am also a little different then most as I run my engines at 3600 to 4000 cruising with the average at 3800. No 
gauges, just a tach, never a problem and over 60k miles on my traveling engine in a fully loaded lowered bus.

&gt;greetings... its been a while since ive posted, but i have a tranny related 
&gt;question. i currently have a '66 with a stock 1500sp and a small nut tranny. 
&gt;runs smooth and quiet and shifts nice.
&gt;
&gt;BUT, i am finally tired of cruising at 52 mph and my club members leaving me 
&gt;in their dust on roadtrips. i have a big nut tranny drum to drum in my 
&gt;garage. been sitting for 5 years. what would i need to turn this into a 
&gt;freeway flier? and where can i source the parts?
&gt;
&gt;additional thought i had... can i put the big nut axles and redux boxes on 
&gt;the small nut tranny?
&gt;
&gt;thanks,
