    I finally got my engine running good today.  It was running really rough
the past week, very sluggish and bogging out in 3rd and 4th. so I figured it
was the timing, I took it to a mechanic friend of mine and we checked the
distributer, it was cracked so we replaced it.  Took out the plugs and # 3,4
plugs were jet black 1,2 were fine.  I did a compression test and everything
was great so I cleaned up the plugs and put them back in thinking it was due
to the timing.  We set the timing and it ran a little better but it still
sounded like it was 'missing'.  I decided to check the vacuum advance and
lo-and-behold it had a leak.  I ended up installing a 009 mechanical advance
distributor, timed it again.  Problem Not Solved (but it still ran better
than last time).
    It was still bogging out in 3rd and 4th like it did not want to go any
faster so we sat and watched it run for awhile, we noticed black smoke
coming from the tail pipe.  I also noticed that their wasn't very much fuel
in the fuel filter (which should be 1/2 full) but my fuel pressure guage was
holding at a steady 3, and when I switched it off the filter filled to 1/2. 
Nightmares of rusty fuel tanks and clogged arteries danced in my head along
with the thought of taking the tank out and having it repaired etc etc etc.
    We decided to change the oil since we weren't getting anywhere with the
problem at hand.  When we drained it, it was like water.  Gas in the oil. 
What the H$#L was going on!!!!.  We took off the carburator and there it was
mocking us from its tiny hiding place.  The choke wire had somehow been cut
or severed and the flaps were totally closed, I was getting too much fuel
and not enough air!!!! We replaced the wire, put the carb back on, re-timed
it, put the oil back in and talk about power.  Penellope is running like a
dream.
    Oh ya, my engine is a brand new 2200 cc with about 1700 km on it.  Came
with the bus when I bought it.
