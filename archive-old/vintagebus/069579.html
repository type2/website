Subject: Re: Relay information and part numbers - was H4 light wiring

&gt;If you need 50 amps there is a 944 relay (for the ignition switch) that
&gt;can handle it with larger connectors (1/2&quot;? as opposed to the standard
&gt;1/4&quot;).

I had some Bosch relays a while back that were something like this.  They
had normal 1/4&quot; push-ons for the coil but 3/8&quot; copper-colored push-ons for
the contacts, and the body was a bit bigger than the usual relay.  You can
find the 3/8&quot; push-on females in good hardware stores.  If I have one left
I'll post the Bosch part number when I find it.

&gt;- Where are 5 prong SPDT relays purchased?

All Electronics still shows the RLY-351 in their latest catalog.  Orinco
brand, $2.40 each.  They also have sockets for them.  I have ordered
and used relays from All and they seem to be working OK.

Local stereo and car alarm shops will have them.  You might luck out and
get Bosch or Hella, or you might get something else.  These shops should
also have the sockets.

Mouser Electronics ( http://www.mouser_dot_com/ ) sells these relays under the
NTE brand.  They're probably actually made by somebody else and branded
NTE, but the quality should be reasonable.  Mouser part numbers
526-R51-5D40-12 (no mounting tab) about $6.50, and 526-R51-5D40-12F
(mounting tab) about $7.  Local electronics parts distributors may also
carry these NTE relays, or a similar relay, but they tend to be rather
proud of their parts.

Digi-Key ( http://www.digikey_dot_com/ ) sells these relays under the Omron
brand, and possibly others.  Part number Z-981 (no mounting tab) $5.20,
and Z-982 (mounting tab) $5.10 .

Del City ( http://www_dot_delcity_dot_net/ ) has Hella made-in-USA relays at great
prices: part number 73980 (mounting tab) for $2.36 and part number 73984
(no mounting tab) for $2.46.  They also carry sockets for these relays.
The only problem is that they have a $25 minimum order.  I have ordered
relays from Del City as well and they are Hella brand, as seen in the
catalog.

It is perfectly possible to hook these relays up with normal 1/4&quot; push-ons
and I have hooked up many of them this way.  Using the socket is optional,
but makes for a somewhat neater installation.

&gt;- What is the full VW PN for a 12v #559 flasher? (I have no clue what
&gt;this is)

As far as I know, there isn't one.  The US flasher vendors have somewhat
standard three-digit numbers for the various flashers they offer.  If
you go to the FLAPS, these three-digit numbers are how they stock and
sell flashers - they'll know what a #559 is but will look at you funny
if you ask for a 211 9xx xxx.  (Remember, in the world outside of
California, the nearest competent FLVWPS can be several hours' drive
away. :)  It's good to be able to source parts that work at the local
AutoZone, Pep Boys, Checker, NAPA, etc.)

The reason I spec'd a #559 is that the pilot light circuit works exactly
the same way as an original VW flasher.  It is possible to put a
more-common two or three prong flasher in your VW and make it work, but
it sometimes requires a bit of rewiring.  The #559 should be a drop-in
replacement.

If you're set on using a VW part, it is possible to use a flasher from
an earlier or later VW that wasn't originally equipped with the 9-prong
or 7-prong box.  Not all of them will work, though.
