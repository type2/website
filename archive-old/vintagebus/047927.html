&lt;&lt;At the classic last year i met a guy who had loads of VW lit that covered

all conversions of the single cab.. I bought one that shows the bed

converted to a dump truck. The whole bed raises up via  a hyudraulic ram. He

also had the side loader pic their so its definetly sanctioned by VW, as

well as a &quot;telephone truck&quot; with raising bed /platform and others.

yep, I saw it too.
He coms out from who knows where to the classic every year.
I bumped into him at the OCTO meet last february.
he said he had a plane to catch.
Hes got a bunch of single sheet oddball sales literature.
