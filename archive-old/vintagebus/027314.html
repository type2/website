&gt; There was some talk a little while back about vehicle dollies. They're on
&gt; sale at Harbor Freight now - $60 for two, $100 for 4. And since they weigh
&gt; 50 lbs, shipping is free.

These are GREAT!!! Heavy steel, make sure to lubricate the bearings on the
casters before you put the car on them! You can just about push a vehicle
around with one hand, and $100 for a set of four is an EXCELLENT price!!!
HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!
