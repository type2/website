is it really nessecary to put in the driver side bolt?

ive had 10 vws , and ive never even seen that bolt, even though every one of
them had the hoover bit,
 on the starter side you just stick the bolt in from the starter side with a
wrench on it so it doesnt turn , then go around back and start the nut on
with your thumb and forefinger while pulling the bolt through with the
fingernail on your middle finger.  If the bolt and nut are clean with a shot
of wd40 you can usually spin it on easily to the point where it grabs and
you can tighten it down.  Takes a little practice.

&gt; I was surprised again yesterday by how hard it is to get the nuts on the
&gt; upper engine bolts in a Type 2.  In fact, I'm still at it this morning.  I
&gt; think if I can jam a socket and extension in front of the driver's side
bolt,
&gt; I may be able to wiggle the nut down past the doghouse shroud and get the
&gt; damned thing started.  I'm still not sure what I'll do to secure the
&gt; right-side bolt.  Anyone have any real good ideas on this subject?
