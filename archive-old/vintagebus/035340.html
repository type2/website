In a message dated 98-07-14 19:06:00 EDT, you write:

&lt;&lt; The flange the slides over the axle that goes inside the grease seal on the
 bearing cover plate. Is it supposed to slide over easily, or is it tight on
 the axle. When I pulled the tranny before, I had to pound it off the axle
with
 a hammer and screwdriver.   &gt;&gt;
Hi Dave, 
It sounds like you dinged up the axle.  You should be able to sand paper and
if absolutely nessary file the real high spots of the damaged area till the
inner spacer for the axle seal slides on.  Just make sure you do as little
sanding as possible and remember that the inner side of this spacer seals with
a O-ring seal, so that area has to be smoothest.  Eric &amp; Barb
