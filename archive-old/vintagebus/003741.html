The only way to get any coating to with stand the rigors of the mother
nature especially on the bed of a truck is to use something that penetrates
the wood real well.  Many of the polyurathanes simply coat the surface.  Not
putting a perfect smooth surface helps some.  Oil based products generally
work better than water based ones.

I have a set of Roberts strips on my double cab that I used an oil based
urethane coating... since my truck hasn't left the shop yet, I have no
judgement of how well it will hold up to UV.  However, I have used the same
product on interior kitchen cabinets and it does real well with water and
detergents.  Nothing is gonna look as good after a year as the day you put
it on unless it's garaged or under a canvas top.

UV resistant urethane spar stuff on 'em and it broke down and wore off in
one year. I'll pull 'em off next spring and redo them with more layers or
better stuff.
