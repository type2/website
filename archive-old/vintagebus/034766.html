 Just before I got to work today my generator light
 popped on.  Pulled into the parking lot, opened the
 lid and everything looks fine.  Belt looks gd,
 generator spinning away, wiring looks gd.
 
 Question is, how do I tell if it is a regulator or
 generator problem?  Since the belt is still on and fan
 working, am I going to hurt anything driving it 15
 miles home to work on it?
 
 As always, thanks.

it could hurt.

first thing- check your brushes- brushes are cheap, and reletively easy to 
replace for the nimble fingered.   they are the carbon rectangles in your 
gen.  THERE ARE TWO AND THE LOWER ONE IS TRICKY TO GET TO.  

doe sthe light get brighter at speed or get dimmer at speed?  dimmer at speed 
tends to be the brushes.
brighter at speed tend sto be the regulator

do not drive at night w/o charging.  headlight drain battery.  I would 
disconnect the wires from the regulator to the gen, and drive 15 miles off 
the battery, if you dont need lights it'll work.  if you do need lights, it 
might work.

I would disconnect, cause I have had a gen burn up when a reg went bad.  that 
sucks.  it made something fry and short out.  I though it was just the gen, 
so I put another in, and it fried too.  then I tossed the reg.  it had a 
corroded bit unde rthe cover.
