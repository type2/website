I know that the doglegs available are junk. At least that's what everyone
seems to say on the list.  Well, many months of looking, and no donor bus in
my area.

Where is the best place to buy replacement dog legs or does it matter? I am
going to order some today, and I just don't want to buy the worst out there,
maybe just the lesser of the evils.

Any input welcome.

Thanks
