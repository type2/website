You Insist that:
&gt;The problem again is that there is no primer or paint under those
&gt;supports
&gt;that are welded to keep the sheet metal from flexing.  Unlike the type 1s
&gt;that
&gt;were dipped completely in a high zinc content primer the buses were
&gt;sprayed

But are you SURE of this. Havent you ever seen the VW ad that shows a bus
being dipped and states that this is why they are more rust resistant?
Maybe someone remembers where that ad is, for shame I don't.
