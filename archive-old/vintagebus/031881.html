accomplished by the lobe on the shaft, about which there is nothing I can do? 
 That is, the alignment of the driving dog, offset lobe, and rotor are fixed 
- unrelated to alignment of the distributor body, cap, and wires.  Dunno if 
I'm making that clear enough.   &gt;&gt;

Hi Joe,
Correct!  That is why it is important to make sure the #1 spark wire is 
hooked to where it is suppose to be when the rotor and the mark in the 
distributor under the cap are all aligned at TDC #1.  Not aligned with the #3 
cylinder where almost all disributor point lobe for #3 is several degrees 
retarded.  Which would cause all the other three cylinders to be suddenly 
advanced.
  In otherwords some volks due to lack of knowledge will install as above the 
spark wire in #3 postion in the distributor cap.  Instead of just remoing 
both the fuel pump, fuel pump base and distributor to allow removing the 
distributor drive and realigning it to work properly with the distributor 
used.  This is often due to the distributor drive having been installed 
incorrectly or at an angle that makes the vaccume advance pod of  some 
distributors interfer with the intake manifold.  Thusly not allowing the 
distributor to be turned to align the #1 spark wire to the rotor inside at 
TDC #1 cylinder.
