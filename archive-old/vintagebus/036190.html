&lt;&lt; Can you tell me what year bus should symmetric euro headlights fit?
 And how about the asymmetric ones?   &gt;&gt;
Hi Micheal,
Will try!  The non-sealed beam Euro headlights were installed in 1955 (4APR55 
chassi number 20-122 677)and earlier VW bus for USA.  From then on the sealed 
beam assymmetric type was installed.  We have found a referance that 
asymmetric headlights were installed from chassi number 614 456 (Just before 
MAY60) for most of Europe otherwise it really depended on the country the VW 
was for.
