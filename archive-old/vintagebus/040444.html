I, too would like to make an offer to the listees.
Only of benefit to the Sacramento area listees however,
as we all have our limits.  This limit is geographical,
but negotiable depending on schedules and distances.

Most of you know I bought a bus tow bar last summer,
borrowed a vehicle to tow my bus home, and then later
borrowed another vehicle to tow Thoms '55 home.  Since then
I have purchased a 4WD vehicle that can tow a bus, no problem,
I don't have to borrow anymore, and it's reached past it's 
break-in period.

Have tow bar will travel, is the offer.

Have loads of other gear
needed to extract a bus, straps, come-along, tail lights to
add to the bus (made from '64 bus taillights!), floor jack, etc.

Get the bus rolling, we'll get it to your home.  Add a bow,
and the bus also becomes a gift!

Heck, it doesn't even have to be a gift, I'll do it for the fun of it!
oops, I hope that doesn't get included.
