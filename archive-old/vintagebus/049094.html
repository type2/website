What do you do with the dirt? Throw a pile onto the front mat and wedge the certificate in it for the shows? What we really need is NOS German air to fill the tires and sprinkle around the dashboard. Maybe there's a vacuum tube plant in Germany that has extra air as a byproduct? Dibs! Buy it on E-Bay in a few weeks or as soon as the jetstream deposits some European air here. Vintage Air for your Aircooled.

Busses aren't beautiful enough to put on a pedestal and appreciate from down here. You have to drive them and experience the whole deal. They're not things, they're how you got it, how you fixed it, what you'll fix next, how it makes you feel, how it makes others feel. 

Thanks for the suggestions about salvage tools. Johr_at_empire_dot_net came up with the best...

&gt;There are a couple different companies that make 18V cordless sawzalls that are pretty much ideal for &gt;&quot;yarding&quot;.
&gt;I have a DeWalt unit that I paid about $280 for and I can pretty much cut a Bus down to nothing with
&gt; 2 fully charged batteries in a couple hours...

But I really wanted to walk into a salvage yard with a  Doom type chainsaw. Guess it's up to me to weld a bunch of broken hacksaw blades onto a chainsaw chain.
