Subject: Headlamp problem

Hi,

Today I replaced the seals around my headlamp glass. In  the process I 
noticed that someone, not me, had nipped off the tabs that align the ring 
that fits behind the sealed beams. More investigation found that the my new 
OEM chrome trim rings were swapped with the innards. So, after swapping and 
fitting the right hand lamp correctly, I found that the left hand lamp ended 
up with the sealed beam turned 90 degrees!

More investigation found that the part numbers on the innards are 211 941 
038 on the right hand side and 111 941 037 on the left side.

Do I have a bug innards on the left?
If so, I need (want) a bus innards.

TIA
Chris
