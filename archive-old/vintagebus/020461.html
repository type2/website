Hello to all,

I guess it's about time for a &quot;Busses Nowhere Near The Arch #17&quot; / a.k.a.
&quot;Busses By The Arch&quot; update for this year.  Yes, the infamous BNNTA#17
Midwest VW camping event is definitely on as usual.  I don't plan to mail
out a paper flyer this year as a reminder, so listen up Bus fans!

This Bus extravaganza will be held over the long upcoming Labor Day weekend
which for this year will be Friday thru Monday, Aug 31st, Sept 1-3, 2001. 
The location will again be at the &quot;group&quot; campground within the Indian
Creek Recreational Area located on the north side of Mark Twain Lake, which
is about 30 miles to the west of the historic city of Hannibal, Missouri. 
We expect about 150 Type 2's of all styles and eras to join together over
the long holiday weekend.  All the usual (and unusual) event activities at
a VW campout will occur (campfire activities, swimming, boating, cycling, a
Bus caravan, informal Bus Show with awards, door prizes, etc.).  I'm sure
the battle to win the coveted individual and group/Club campsite awards
will be fierce again this year, so use your creativity!  The event AND
camping fee for each VW vehicle for the entire weekend is only $25 total
(same as the last few years), and again, ONLY VW's will be allowed to enter
and camp. 

Whether you're a longtime regular attendee or a new comer, we'd love to
have you join us for the Type 2 festivities.  You'll meet a lot of great
people and see a whole lot of VW's camping out!  The &quot;bare bones&quot;
www.BussesByTheArch_dot_com web site currently has the 2000 event flyer info
up, but will very shortly be updated (thanks to our buddy &quot;No Quarter&quot;)
with the date changes.  The event format and event schedule doesn't change
much from year to year, as we figure why mess with a good thing?  There is
a &quot;Mapquest&quot; map link there also to aid you in finding all of us!

If you can be in the area, we'll look forward to seeing you amid all the
VW's!  Feel free to pass this info on to your VW Bus buddies, and have them
check out the web site for more details.  So make your plans, fix up and
pack up your Bus, and get on over here for all the fun!

Bill Bowman
BNNTA organizer

p.s.  Could someone please forward this to the Vanagon List (or any other
appropriate VW Lists) if you're on them?  Thanks!
