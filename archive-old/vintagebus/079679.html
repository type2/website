Subject: Steering wheel nut

Looks like i buggered up the threads on my steering
wheel while trying to get the wheel off.  Had to hit
the top hard in order to pop the wheel off.

Anyone know what the tap size is so i can chase the
threads?

Anyone have a tap they are willing to rent me?

Thanks

Matt
