Subject: VIN &amp; Engine no. queries

Hi guys,
I've been trying to suss out the VIN &amp; engine numbers
on my '67 panel.
The VIN is 217070008 which I presume is a Type
21(Panel) made around the end of '66.
This is odd as the plate also has 7/67 on it?
The only number I can find on the engine case has no
initial H, only the numbers 8900415.
Is this a 1500cc?
Is it a replacement engine?
Is it a late or early model engine out of a bug?
This bus has seen alot of miles and a lot of different
mechanics.
I'd love some hints on this.
:o)
Cheers
Andy P.
