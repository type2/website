&gt;I was given by a friend an English made Matchbox model of a b_at_y window
&gt;Dormobile made in 1970.  It looks like a '70 bus except it has the pre
&gt;'64 smaller hatch.  Is this possible to have the small hatch on a b_at_y or
&gt;is it just an error in reproduction?

There were these brazilian buses that had bay front doors and windshields,
but *barndoor* cargo doors, split-style side windows, hatch and corner
windows.  They also had an upright engine.
