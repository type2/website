Subject: '56 Double Door seen, Movie bad for bus
Message-ID: &lt;LAOMAHKPGNNOBAAA_at_mailcity_dot_com&gt;

I've been seeing a sealing wax red '56 double door
panel cruising around Auburn, CA lately.  Beautiful.
Divider panel, safari's, incorrect overrider
bumpers though, but thankfully stock suspension.  Gorgeous bus, big 'ol smile on the driver!

A movie NOT for vintage bus fans is one with 
Jackie Chan, I can't remember the title, but it's
something like Flight of the Condor 2.  During a
car chase scene the bad guys fly over a highway
and land on the back of a split single cab loaded
with boxes, and you can see the boxes explode and
the cab get burned up, what a waste.
