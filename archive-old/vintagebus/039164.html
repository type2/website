Subject: OAL of accelerater cable?
Message-ID: &lt;DFD1EF94802BD21181C50060080B9D8F1C5080_at_LIMONFS&gt;

Morning list

The accelerater cable on my '61 doublecab bust and I lost the carb end
in a recent cleanup. Anyone out there know what the overall length is. I
am getting one made up and need the length so that the thickened bit at
the carb end will be in the right place.

TIA
Michael
