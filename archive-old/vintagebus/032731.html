&lt;&lt; It's probably *technologically* possible, but not politically possible.
 Due to some stalker incidents a few years ago, DMV will only release the
 smallest amount of information possible.  In the stalker case, some guy
 got a girls home address from DMV by providing her license plate number,
 then went to her house and killed her. &gt;&gt;

I'm wondering if since I have the name (previous owner) and want the serial 
number if they would give me that?  Any thoughts?
