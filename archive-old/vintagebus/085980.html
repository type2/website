Hi Morning Dove,
Check out the parts manual at :  _http://failsure_dot_net/oacdp/_ 
(http://failsure_dot_net/oacdp/)    
  Also good to mention what year of bus or better yet year of front  
suspension if it has been changed.
  Once you have the part number and proper name for the part get back  to us.
