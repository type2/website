no offense to ya ronnie, your the man, BUT, thats easy for you to say when 
there are MANY other shows to attend out west. There are only like a dozen 
*good* shows here in the north east ALL season (if that). besides this show 
is hosted by the Michigan Air Cooled club. VWoA doesnt do anything but let 
them use the parking lot and open the doors so we can check out a few cars. 
and do you think those asswipes upstaris scanning the net for Volkswagen 
content care if we dont show up? its too bad. damned if you do, damned if 
you dont :-)

just my $.02.... ill be there.
