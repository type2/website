Subject: RE: [VB] VW parts vendor with fastest delivery...

&gt; I am a lonely Midwesterner (ie. No VW parts dealers
&gt; ANYWHERE near).  I am looking for a good vendor that
&gt; has good, fast delivery service. I have been ordering
&gt; most of my parts from Cip1_dot_com, but by the time they
&gt; ship from their warehouse in British Columbia to the
&gt; distrubution center in Washington State, and then to me in
&gt; Ohio, it is usually close to 2 weeks before I get my parts.
&gt; I am needing a rocker panel for my 67 bus ASAP. I wanted to
&gt; order from Bus Depot, they had the part for lowest price, but
&gt; their customer service quoted me $30+ dollars shipping on the
&gt; part which only cost $27, so obviously NOT an option in this
&gt; situation.


John,

I've got a solution for you. I found one in stock at a distributor in your
home state, and can have them dropship it directly to you  You'll have it in
a few working days for half the shipping cost. (As a few people have pointed
out, it is the size and weight of the package that deternines the UPS rate.
Even though a rocker panel is cheap, it's big. On air shipments, UPS tacks
on a substantial surcharge if the package is &quot;oversized.&quot; But by
dropshipping it from a location near you, we can switch to ground and cut
the surcharge way down, and you'll still have it quickly.)  Let me know if
this works for you.
