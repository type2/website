 I ma going to order mirrors for my 61 this week... and have come to this
 point...
 
 I like the round ones because they look way cool.  But, i wonder how well
 you can see to the rear with em. I have a 61 and i plan to drive it a
 lot.  It has the small rear window so the mirrors may well be an important
 tool.
 
 The elephant ears look like they might be better suited for seeing out of,
 but they arent as cool looking... i think they started offering the
 elepahnt ears 61 or earlier, so either one is correct...
 
 any opinions from those who have used both/either as to usefulness when
 driving?

you can see better from the elephant ears.     The little round one are 
definately more cool looking.  Take your pick.

 p.s. one of my taillight glass pieces is cracked, and one of my rings has
 lost its chrome... anyone have a spare of either they'd let go
 reasonably? &gt;&gt;

If you plan to drive it alot, you may just want to leave it that way, people 
have been known to walk back to the bus and find the cool round taillights 
gone.    As long as no white light showed around he glass youre okay.
