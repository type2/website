Has anyone actually measured the voltage drop across the cable?  If the
voltage drop is small with the stock cable I don't see how reducing it by
25% or even 63% will make much difference.

The larger cables are thicker
and stiffer and much harder to run through the hole in the body.  In
addition, the stiffness is harder on the insulating grommets that I hope
folks are using around them.  You _really_ don't want the unfused battery
cable to find ground!

If I was trying to start a big block Chevy from a trunk mounted battery I
would worry about the cable size, but turning a VW with a run of only a
few feet the stock size should work fine.
