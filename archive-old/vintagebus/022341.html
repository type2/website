Yes, Steven, come on out.  I did, and even though my family was shocked, at
least I don't have to hide my affection for drafty, underpowered funky old
busses any more.  I also consider it good therapy:  With a 40-horse, I've
become intimately familiar with 55 mph and the slow lane.  But there's just
*something* about driving it...

Don't wait 3 years like I did!

&gt;Yes, don't hide your true feelings.  Look at Tom Mink, first a 
&gt;Cal-Look bug guy, then a Ghia Guy, and now he's promoted himself
&gt;to a type2 guy with a '64 single cab.  Some day he will reach
&gt;true enlightenment, and become a Barndoor Guy.

&gt;&gt; beginning to wonder if I'm perhaps a &quot;closet&quot; type II guy underneath all
&gt;&gt; this type I facade!
&gt;&gt; Should I just come out and proclaim my proclivity!
