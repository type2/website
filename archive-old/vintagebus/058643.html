Subject: selling my ford conv for a good cause! Duh!

Hello list,

Harry made me realize something I forgot to mention about selling my ford 
convertable.  I am useing the money from it, and a Rabbit I have for sale to 
fund my &quot;Save the Double Cab Fund&quot;.  Yes, I have found a very nice db very 
close to me, but unfortunatlly for me, the guy knows his VWs and also wants 
a Harley.......  So I am selling my conv.  I am not attched to it or 
anything, I actually bought it when I was younger to fix up and sell to a 
friend, but I got caught up with our farm, VWs, and college, (and besides, 
I'm a Chevy person myself).  So now that you all know what I am pineing for, 
you can send all donations to:

338 Hamilton Hall
Residence Area
University Park Pa

lol,
I dont have the conv on ebay yet, but will prolly next week.  I will keep 
the list posted on my progress.  I want to just use it as a daily driver for 
now and focus on some other things, but eventually will restore and paint it 
identically to my 67 beetle.

thanks!
Matt

Matt,
  Glad to help. You should have told the list that you're
going to use the Ford money to buy/restore a vintage bus!

  No immediate relatives around PA. I was born in Ohio
where you can't swing a dead cat without hitting a bunch
of German farmers named Houck.

 &gt; Hello,
 &gt;
 &gt; Thanks for the information, I really appriciate it.  Your last name is 
the
 &gt; same as a few people I work with, do you have relatives in PA that work 
at
 &gt; the PSU Dairy?  just wondering,
 &gt;
 &gt; Thanks!
 &gt; Matt

 &gt; Matt,
 &gt;
 &gt;    I've sold a few things on E-Bay. My tips, FWIW...
 &gt;
 &gt; Look at other car ads first. If a car appeals to you, copy their style 
and
 &gt; wording. Folksy, factual, optimistic, father-son, nostalgic. Use a theme 
if
 &gt; it appeals to you.
 &gt;
 &gt; Get really good pictures even if it's in primer. Take it to a ritzy part 
of
 &gt; town and put it in front of a nice house or a park. Flip 'em $10 if they 
let
 &gt; you park it on the lawn. If you know someone who can modify the picture 
and
 &gt; apply digital paint and a few sparkles IN ADDITION to the real pictures.
 &gt;
 &gt; Place your ad to end on a Saturday or Sunday evening. You'll have more 
last
 &gt; minute bidders if they can be at their computers.
 &gt;
 &gt; Give a phone number and be ready to answer, give available times. Some 
like
 &gt; to hear a voice and ask a few questions.
 &gt;
 &gt; Be honest! Expose all the negative in the ad. Estimate the effort/cost to
 &gt; fix the problems.
 &gt;
 &gt; Set a realistic beginning price, not something stupid like one cent.
 &gt; Reserve? I like to set my starting bid at the lowest price I'll take. 
Don't
 &gt; set a reserve if you want to get rid of it and think that the low price 
is
 &gt; fair. Hard to say, look at other ads and see if you like the &quot;deal&quot; and 
make
 &gt; your decision.
 &gt;
 &gt;   Hope it helps
 &gt;
