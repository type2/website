............
&gt;  That is great info on 15&quot; tires!!!!  Has anyone experienced the
&gt; &quot;center wear&quot; issue when running 205 75R 15 on their 4.5 inch rims?
..............

I already had the 205's when Matt posted his warning, &amp; haven't changed 'em
for lack of a better option.

I have not noticed any wear at all on these tires yet, not to mention center
wear.  Probably got 10,000 miles on em.  The tires appear to sit flat on the
ground, FWIW.

Tom Buese-tires, can't live w/o em, can't burn em
