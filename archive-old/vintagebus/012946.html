I just hooked up the manual choke cable on the 1956 panel I am working on with a friend.  It won't start and run without the choke but with the choke on just a little it starts right up and idles.  After a minute or two we push it in (the choke cable) and everything idles fine.  Manual chokes are cool.  On the other hand, I think the auto choke on my 1600 was giving me problems for a while.  So I can't really vouch for them.

My 2 cents.

&gt; &gt; What is everybody's view on either disconnecting the choke or leaving it
&gt; &gt; hooked up.
