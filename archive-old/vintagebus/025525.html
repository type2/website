My wife has just laid down the law after having my 63 VW Crew cab
sitting in my drive way for two years she has given me an ultimatum
either get the bus painted or sell it. I am choosing to Keep the Bus.
but since I don't know much about auto body work does anyone out there
know of a good shop in the Pomona ,CA area or inland empire where I can
have my bus worked on or is there a listie that can accomplish the task
I am willing to pay.
