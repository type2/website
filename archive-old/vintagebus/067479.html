Subject: re:vintage EV bus... biofuels

&gt;One of the problems with biofuels are that the btu content and other
&gt;properties vary widely from their different sources.  For large consumers
&gt;such as McDs, they can funnel all their used french fry oil into a
&gt;processing plant and obtain a fairly consistent product but this is not the


this is true.. BUT, they ALSO run on corn or veggie oil straight from the 
bottle, straight from the shelf at the grocery store. in that sense, the 
&quot;fuel&quot; would (could) be very consistant. the people that would use the 
recycled fryer oil would have to set up their ride to run that.
