Subject: RE: [VB] M216 and tranny ratio ramblings

&gt;I am having a 3.44 trans built with the 1.22 3rd and a 89 4th gear&lt;

That is a very nice ratio with the small nut 1.38 RGBs!  Very nice!

Who is the maker of the 3.44 R&amp;P?  I will give them a call and see what they
have to say on $.  If the other stuff is boring common stock parts this is a
winner.

You could cruise all day at 70-75 with the small RGBs!  The engine with this
combo has to be a low end torque monster though.

Thanks,
Adrian

When going to the 3.88 ring and pinion you have to use the splined main
shaft, the 1.22 3rd is easy to find splined but the .82 4th are getting
harder to find. The 82 4th keyed are a dime a dozen. Also even the 3.88 r.p
are getting really hard to find and a lot of Brazilian are showing up and
strting to be used. It's almost to the point when buildinf a freeway flyer
the price will change according to the parts used with the OG 3.88 r/p and
the splined .82 OG 4th costing almost 100 dollars more in a freeway flyer
then using the brazilian gears.  The point is watch what you get, I have
found out that a lot of the lower priced 3.88 trans out there are built
using brazilian aftermarket parts, the plot thickens.

ps. I am having a 3.44 trans built with the 1.22 3rd and a 89 4th gear, this
gives me a little more top end but puts the gear percentage drop in line
better then with a 3.88. So I will be able to run 3rd gear up higher before
shifting into 4th so I will not drop my rpm's out of the torque band. It is
actually cheaper to build then a GOOD 3.88 because the only aftermarket gear
is the Made in U S A r/p and the rest of the gears are OG

First off does anyone have a spare small nut 1.26 ratio RGB (M216) setup
from a '63 sitting around they do not need anymore?  If so I need it, please
:)

Okay I have been on the phone and searching the archives on this &quot;freeway
flier&quot; stuff... It is quite a chore to make a good one with all the right
parts.  Hopefully I can do some creative junkyarding and source some parts.
New gears are pricey!

Also as a side note I do not think it would be a good idea to run a stock
1600 with a freeway flier.  After doing the math, it is a lot to pull that
kind of gears.  I have seen it done, but never driven one.

First off I am starting in the hole with small nut RGBs with 1.39 ratio.
(help. please. see above M216)  It is a lot of gearing to overcome just to
get back where the later 1.26 ratio starts, in my case 5 MPH difference with
27.7 diameter tires. I could ramble on, but here is a formula that works for
me:

1st = stock
2nd = stock
3rd = 1.217 (113 style 1.21 early Type II - need to modify the pinion shaft)
4th = .82 (from a bay 002 tranny)   
RGB = 1.38 (some say 1.38 others 1.39)
R&amp;P = 3.875
Not sure what housing I need to use, but that should not be hard once I see
everything...

All this equals about 65 MPH at 3500 RPM.

If you want good juicy details look up Todd Hill in the archives.

Also factor in a tranny rebuild kit (about $100) and then two small nut RGB
rebuild kits (about $88 each at Bus Boys, only price I could find on the
net).  Plus the 944 rear brakes and master cylinder($125 new), not sure the
impact here.  Possibly the cost of M216 RGBs if someone has a set FS.  Plus
the necessary gears from who knows where.

I might just buy a pre-made tranny to these specs from a known local guy who
does a great job.  But I need to talk to him first as to cost, I figure I
can do it myself for 200-250 + PITA factor (just tranny).

...  Oh wait now the motor need to grow to push the bus up a hill due to the
high gearing!... Another big project.  Anyone have a WBX 2.1 76.4mm crank
laying around they want to part with?  FWIW the CIS FI part is coming along
underbudget so far :)

Then I need tires, Bilstein shocks, trailer hitch and camber compensator...
Then comes the body work and paint :(

Overall a complete waste of time and money... Shear stupidity keeps me
moving ahead...  Totally unexplainable and unjustifiable.
