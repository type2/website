&gt; Just got mu 66 panel running (?) again.  Been sitting for a few months (
don't ask
&gt;  why).  It will start easly and idle fine.  I can rev it but it has a bit
of a stumble up to
&gt;  about 2,000RPMS.  When I try to drive it, it won't run very well at all,
misses and
&gt;  stumbles and dies.  If I coast to a stop it will return to an idle
without a problem.
&gt;  I've replaced the plugs, points,rotor and cap.  Did one of the cheap-o
rebuilds on the
&gt;  carb and checked the timing.

Did you replace the accelerator pump when you did the &quot;cheap-o&quot; carb
rebuild? Are you sure it isn't kinked and drawing air?

Did you replace the condenser?

&gt; Set the valves and put fresh gas in the tank.

Did you check the compression?
