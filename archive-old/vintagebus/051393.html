Subject: RE: [VB] Air compressor and water

You know, I keep forgetting that not everyone has a 20hp 40 CFM 125PSI
VolksAir air compressor. Most people have electric wheezers. I have the
luxury of mounting my tank wherever and placing a trap on the input and
output.

*Before* which - the tank?  How does one do that?
