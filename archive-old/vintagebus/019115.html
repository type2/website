&gt; I usually pass through the show cars for about 5 minutes.

Me too.

&gt; I guess they are elimenating the swap meet as well.....havent seen too many 
&gt; &quot;show cars&quot; showing up with a load full of barndoor parts.

I've wondered how the swap stuff is supposed to get in...

&gt; They should close off the rear parking lot and have all the beater busses 
&gt; park out there.

Just the beater buses?  Or the beater, lowered, primered cal-looker bugs too?

&gt; Last thing I want to do is leave my bus parked out in the packing lot in San 
&gt; Jose unattended at a VW show.
&gt; *IF* it was still there I'm sure the 1000$ bumpers, 600$taillights, 300$ 
&gt; reflectors, 500$ decklid, 500$ seats, and lots of other stuff would be 
&gt; missing.

Yeah, but you can buy it back on ebay the next week...
