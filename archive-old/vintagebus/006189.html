free stuff is OK as long as people keep or use those parts...... sometimes
they end up on certain auction sites....
a while ago I sent someone a 6V starter for free..... never heard again....
just recently I gave away some trim pieces (great to know someone could use
these) now I have a Saphire radio I might want to get rid off (came original
with my Bus - don't know if it even works) .... free but shipping might be
too much to even consider.
Just me....

&gt; Wow, all this summer generosity has almost brought a tear to my eye.
Almost.
&gt;
&gt;  In the spirit of the moment, I've got a front peddle cover (pre 68 I
think
&gt; not sure) for free if someone wants it.  It has been modified some time in
&gt; its life (read squashed), but I think its useable.  E-mail for details,
but
&gt; you've got to pick it up in No. Orange County.
&gt;
&gt; Come on you parts horders ... show your bus spirit and give someone a
&gt; part.   Free the junk!
