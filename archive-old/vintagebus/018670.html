I think it's between Izzy's (if anyone can find him.  Should we call
Robert Stack?) and Creative Engineering.  Bus Boys and Wolfgang made
too many compromises in the tradeoff between design and cost, using
a square-channel frame instead of triangular, and modified cheepie
latches instead of the original style.  CD also makes barndoor
safaris, and I think they're the only ones that do.

I have a set of CE safaris, I've had them for almost a year.  Yes,
the leak, but even NOS safaris leak.

You can get used ones, but they're one of those wallet-busting propositions
that people think they can retire on.  Then you'll have to restore them,
meaning new seals, rechroming latches, paint, etc.

&gt; So... I have heard different stories re Safari Window quality and longevity 
&gt; from non-list members and now I want it from the *experts*, from those who 
&gt; care.  NOS would be nice but how about the aftermarket ones like Busboys?  
&gt; And the thread asking about Izzy?  Any opinions on who's are closest to 
&gt; original and have the best performance... as in going the distance?  Both 
&gt; front and rear ?  I am starting the planning on my 1963 15-Window 
&gt; restoration and although not original to this unit I like the idea alot.
