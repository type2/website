Subject: VW Trends - 50 years of the bus
Mime-Version: 1.0


Normally I don't read the VW rags, but I had to pick this one up.

Most of the mag is devoted to buses, and while there are some cool tidbits
of info, there's enough incorrect information to make me doubt the tidbits.
(*sigh*) &quot;Like a panel van, the kombi has three windows down the side of
the cargo area...&quot;

Jerry Jess must be sleeping with some of the editors or the VW rags - he's
getting a LOT of press lately.  I'll probably never be seen on the inside
of a VW rag, since I've been outted as an anti-sotoite.
