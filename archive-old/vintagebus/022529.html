Calm down people, don't break a sweat!  I don't want a flame war to break
out.  Looks like we're having a breakdown in communications here.  Pull
into the breakdown lane and cool off...

(starting to sound like a broken record...)

I wasn't scolding, just grabbing the sweet and easy puns.

And now we'll take a break from this and return to our regularly scheduled
discussion...
