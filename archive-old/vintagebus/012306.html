Subject: Thoughts of Josh

Evidentally Josh gave alot to many of us. I was searching for the proper
words. and thought of the passage regarding rust in Matthew, Chapter 6 in an
attempt to glean a tool to put relavance to what is truly of value and what
is only temporary. My backsliding ways made me unsure of the actual message.
So like an unsure mechanic, I broke out the dusty manual that goes too often
unread. Soon the whole chapter was speaking out to me- especially in this
Holiday Season. 

I figure that there are two basic commonalities among us. The actual
vehicles that we discuss and deal with at length and the human interaction
that comes along with them. Josh was only one of the travelers on the road
of life that I have been lucky enough to have waved at in passing.

As I wave at strangers during my travels, and they in the midst of their's,
it will be easy for me to think of Josh and the many other folks that I have
met due to involvement with Volkswagens. As I wave, I will try to remind
myself that the true treasure that we share amongst us is each other and the
lives that we lead. Hopefully I will remember not to be anxious about all of
the many things in our modern lives and will remind myself that our loving
God provides for us. Hopefully I will remember to be kind to others in that
VW recognition waving way even when I'm away from the road. Maybe I will
remember to slow down and be kind to myself as well as I travel. I will try
to remember the reason that we Christians celebrate Christmas and the
promise that God made to Abram.

Thank you Josh for the emails, the interactions and the opportunity to get
my head back into the manuals. God Bless you in your travels and I will
watch for your friendly wave.
