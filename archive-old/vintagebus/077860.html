Subject: 64 SC antenna's

Hello all. My recently acquired 64 SC has a 1 inch hole about an inch or so 
above the VW logo. I am assuming this was an antenna mount hole at some time as 
there are not any holes on the left or right sides, only this one in the 
center. Anyone know of an antenna that would fit this hole as I don't want to 
drill anywhere else thru the metal to mount the typical type 2 antennas. Thank you!
