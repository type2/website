 Some notes on the rebuilt tranny.  Fourth gear howls.  Not as loudly as in
 the Kombi, but it does.  Second gear has a little bite to it until the oil 
has
 warmed up some, then it smooths out.  Finally, third gear has popped out 
about
 five times in 300 or so miles of driving.  I'm looking for opinions on what 
to
 adjust to get around some of these problems (I know 4th gear is just gonna
 howl).  Heck, even some input on what you think about the life of a tranny
 doing this stuff.  This is my first rebuilt, so I don't really know what I'm
 supposed to expect out of it.  And, no, I've never actually driven one that
 was perfect either.

typically you should expect shifting to be stiff for the first 50 or so 
miles.  Then it smooths out.  this is why you do need to change the trans oil 
at 300 or whatever miles, as when it starts working it creats shavings that 
left unattended will mess up your bearings.  But how many miles do you have 
on it?  You may want to take it back f0or the warranty fix, as it just ain't 
right to be popping out of third, and whining in 4th.

FWIW I put a rebuild Todd Hill tranny in my 61 shortly before heading south 
for KP.  It has now somewhere around 3K miles on it.   On the way back up 
from KP I thought I had lost 1st and 2nd, causing a problem when 500 miles 
from home.  But I found if I pushed down like into reverse then I could find 
first and second.   SO I readjusted the plate on the floor, the 2 13mm bolts, 
just loosened them, and repositioned it, and tightened them, and it shifts 
real nice now.

But though that may help with 3rd popping (did you check to see your shift 
linkage screws aren't backing out?) it won't help with the whining.  300 
miles? I would check the linkage and readjust the shift stick, change the 
oil, and see how it goes.  Definately get out your warranty papers, and if 
you are not happy, plan to get it done again.
