Subject: 1961 DC correct front doors???

Been away for a while with a new job, new son etc. 
Still working on the 61 DC.  Real slow progress. 
Almost have all the parts painted and ready to go back
together.  This is in now way a restoration.  Just
want it to look OK and work well.

I noticed that in my quest last year to get new doors
that i somehow ended up with 2 different kinds.  Both
pull handle.  One has the handle base (where it mounts
to the door) flat and the other has about a 1/4&quot;
recess.  My 60 DC had the flat doors.  What is correct
for the 61?  I seam to remember that the recessed
version was a one or two year things and that the
handle was different in some way.  Can anyone help and
remind me what is what.

Thanks.
matt
