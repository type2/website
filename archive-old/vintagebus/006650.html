Will the normal bug quick shifter  fit on a bus ?

this is the cast aluminium plate that fits under the the shifter hold down 
plate (the one that bolts to the floor with 2 bolts)

it shortens up the throw by changing the pivot point.....

Or does anyone have an old original EMPI - Deano - Hurst tall shifter for a 
bus ?
