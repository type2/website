&lt;&lt; Any reason why I shouldn't switch it over to a regular nut with 
 another nut to lock it in place? &gt;&gt;

Hi Rex,
We went to the wing nut about six years ago.  Definitely a better setup when 
done right and it is easier to adjust a 1/2 turn per twist where with a 
wrench in with the earlier ajusting nut you are lucky to get 1/8 of a turn at 
a twist.  Do tap and die the threads of the cable end and the wing nut.  Then 
grease up the threads totally to prevent future rusting.  Both of these steps 
should be done to earlier non-wing nut types also!  To really make the wing 
nut work easily you file down or completely off the locking nubs on the 
forward side of the wing nut.  If you are using the early style arm that the 
clutch cable goes through a circle instead of the later diamond shape you 
will need to remove the entire locking nubs on the wing nut.  Do not change 
the arm!  Doing so puts the bore of the support cast into the left tranny 
side plate that holds the rear end of the boden tube out of alignment with 
the rear end of the clutch cable!  Resulting in clutch cables that rub 
themselfs to death on the end of the boden tube in less than 10,000 miles.  
BTDT!  Next time you take the engine out look over the tranny bell housing at 
the alignment of these two points and make sure the boden tube end is pointed 
straight with the rear section of clutch cable to the arm it goes through.
