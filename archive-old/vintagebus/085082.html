Subject: VW parts vendor with fastest delivery...

John Baker wrote:

&gt;&gt;Howdy Y'all,
&gt;&gt;I am a lonely Midwesterner (ie. No VW parts dealers
&gt;&gt;ANYWHERE near).  I am looking for a good vendor that
&gt;&gt;has good, fast delivery service. 

&gt;&gt;So any
&gt;&gt;Midwesterners who have ordered from them and can
&gt;&gt;remark on their delivery times\service??? Any other
&gt;&gt;vendors I don't know about???

Try

www.mamotorworks_dot_com and click on air-cooled VW

It's Mid America Motorworks in Effingham, Illinois

They specialized in Corvette for years as the Real Source, then began
going to VW a few years ago, then bought all the Rocky Mountain
Motorworks stock when RMMW folded.  I haven't been impressed with their
web page (hard to find parts and too bling-bling oriented in my opinion)
and I detest that they don't use VW part numbers.  I complained as much
in an Email and received a reply that if I call in an order with VW part
numbers they could translate it for me.

MAM has adapted to the VW culture somewhat, host a VW Fun Fest each
June, and are a thousand miles closer to Ohio.  I'm in northern
Illinois, have visited their place in Effingham (5 hour drive from me) a
couple of times.

They suffer from some of the same shortcomings that RMMW did, but I
haven't received a wrong part or waited forever for delivery from the
west coast.  I haven't bought any sheet metal from them, so I can't
attest to the quality there.
