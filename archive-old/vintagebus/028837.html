You can also buy the Albatross adjusters from Bus Boys and have them installed
before you bolt-up the beam.  This allows you to adjust the height like a bug
does.

&gt; &gt; does anybody have any info on this modification?
&gt;
&gt; The bay window beam into split has been discussed ad nauseum. Plenty of info
&gt; in the archives. For a brief synopsis, it goes like this. 68-69 beam bolts
&gt; into splitties. 71ish torsion arms fit into said beam. They have disc
&gt; brakes. Simple bolt in except that the front of the bus will be a couple
&gt; inches higher. For another flavor, the Westfailure has a late bay beam in it
&gt; with vacuum assist disc brakes. Top two bolts into original holes, bottom
&gt; had two new holes cut into beam flange to match holes on frame. Bolted right
&gt; in, no mods to the stretched and boxed V8 Westy frame. Standard drag link as
&gt; near as I can tell. Will need to go to dual circuit master cylinder,
&gt; proportioning valve seems to be based on peoples tastes. If you search the
&gt; archives you can read about disc brakes, bay beam swaps, and VeeWee's
&gt; detailed descriptions of the dual circuit master cylinder conversion until
&gt; your eyes bleed.
