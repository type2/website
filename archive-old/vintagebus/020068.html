  I don't know how many of you realize this, but you own 
the ultimate Drive-in vehicle! Woodward Park Drive-In 
just opened for the season here in Fresno, CA. Yea!! 
We're going this Saturday to see &quot;The Mummy Returns&quot; 
with &quot;Josie and the Pussycats.&quot; 
    I'm going to Barbeque and Lisa will make some 
macaroni salad to take, we'll put a couple chairs in the 
back of the new DC, a boom box on the roof rack and have 
a great time!
  In the past we put our camping bunk in the back of 
the '62. That way we back up towards the sceen and open 
up the rear hatch. The bus provides a super comfy movie 
experience - beats the reclining seats at the multiplex 
hands down. In fact, it would be a real make out-wagen 
if we weren't married (Ha!).
  If you live in the area and want to join the cruise-in 
p-mail me. It would be great to have a row of busses 
there, it'll be a fun time!
