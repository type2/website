Subject: Paintin' me bus

So .... it seems like I've been working on the upper half of my 60 for the
whole summer - d*mn.

I spent forever working on my roof.  I had to fix the repair some idiots did
in Winnipeg a few years ago.  So with the help of a 17&quot; sanding block and load
of filling and blocking it looks awesome.  Then I epoxy primed a couple of
times and shot high build a couple of times and blocked and sanded some more
then ... I sanded through the highbuild and through the epoxy.  So ... I shot
epoxy a couple more times and more high build and more sanding ... and every
looked ... very nice.

Then ... I shot paint.  Two coats of urethane - runs everywhere - on the nose
there was ah huge mother of a run .. about a 1' wide sage with maybe ... 10
runs coming from it - I was suicidal - plus there was about 10 other major
runs ...

So, I sanded em all out and it worked very well.  There were a couple of then
spots so I planned on shooting paint again.  Did that today - whoooo hooooo I
have one tiny run that is in a very easy place to fix.  Damn this looks good.
Even the door jambs look excellent - whoooo hooooo.
