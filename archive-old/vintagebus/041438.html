Hi Richard,
I put in a Brazilian one and it broke not in two weeks, but two
months.  Not much difference.  I don't know if you can get the bus ones
anywhere, but Wolfsburg West had the chrome ones for Beetles that are
original, I'm not sure if they still have them.  You can definitely tell
the difference between the two in the way they operate and feel.
