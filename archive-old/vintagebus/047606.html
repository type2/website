 the Huber beer fan and fisherman seen in the xmas cards sent in to
 HotVws.His hilarious cards are featured every year !! You guys who go to
 Buses By The Arch I'm sure have checked out his bus. The bus is called the
 &quot;Blue Bomber&quot;. &gt;&gt;

Long time NEATO members may remember his epic &quot;3,000 miles, two windshields 
and one good time&quot; saga of a few years back.

Just got back from Bug o Rama, sunburn! Ouch!
