Subject: Re: [VB] SW gas heater question.....

Eric, the SW heaters would at times put out a little smoke, but shouldn't
put out much.  I do have all the tuneup parts you need and have in stock the
flexable exhaust pipe and clamps.  You can see the parts at:

&gt; I was wondering if it was normal for the exhuast to put out black smoke (just
&gt; faint, but it is there). It's not a lot, but you can see it. Is it supposed to
&gt; burn perfectly clean, or is this how it is?
