&gt;Most everything else is standard bus of that year stuff. There might be 
&gt;some other stuff I'm forgetting. Anyone?

I believe that the striker plate for the rear passenger door is DC unique.  
I pretty sure mine's got a '265 ...' part number on it.  Steve did a good 
job of covering the DC stuff though.  By the way, I'm still looking for a 
bed for mine if anyone's got one burning a hole in their pocket (yeah right)
