&gt; I finally found a unique Hula Girl that I really like.  There are 3 styles
&gt; to choose from.  They are rather realistic underneath their clothes but I'm
&gt; going to keep my Hula Girl fully clothed at all times.  If you wanna see
&gt; them, go to
&gt; http://www.bobbingheads_dot_net/Hulagirls.htm but keep in mind that if you click

that was an interesting site.  The shrunken heads made out of goat skin looked
kinda appealing.  I'm trying to figure out if I could get away with one of those
hanging from my rear view mirror.  The hula girl might not go over too well in my
house hold where even the cat is female.

Now what would be great to see is a big bunch of busses at the next meet all with
item 37 hanging from the engine compartment
http://www.bobbingheads_dot_net/Item037big.htm  :-))

For all those busses that have been christened with female names and are
affectionately referred to as &quot;she&quot;, sorry about the above item, it will just
serve to corral all the &quot;guy&quot; busses in one area.
