Subject: Reduction Box Theories?

Is it possible (meaning has anyone actually done it)
to put the large nut style reduction box assemblies,
including the axle tubes, on split case trannies to
give a better final drive ratio? I can't see a reason
why they wouldn't bolt up to both the transmission and
the spring plates. The axles should be the same
(length), so if everything is the same length and uses
the same bearings for the axle (coming out of the
transmission/ the top 2 bearings), why not? And if it
CAN be done (meaning someone has done it), are there
any things were a problem? I really don't want to go
throught the troubles of putting a later trans in and
all the B.S. of the whole front mount thing. Any
thoughts, comments, suggestions would be appreciated.
