&gt; According to the Bentley only buses after Feb had a seal on the nosecone so

Hi Paul,
First slide under you bus and see if you can see a seal area pressed into the 
nose cone.  Even if it should be there your tranny or nose cone over the 
decades could have been replaced with an earlier one by the DPO.  Next if you do 
have a seal there the bushing just inside could be way worn and this would 
allow the wieght of the hockey stick to push down on the lower side of the seal 
and leave a gap between it and the top half of the seal.
