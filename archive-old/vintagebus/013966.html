hey,
i used to work for a gas &amp; welding place... saw some crazy safety videos. 
since its friday i'll tell you about one. this guy was trying to make an air 
compressor out of an old propane tank. he was in his back yard holding the 
tank between his legs and using a monkey wrench to get the valve off. 
apparently he slipped and created a little spark and the top 1/4 of the tank 
blew off and took both his arms from the elbow down. one was in his yard and 
the other was three of four houses down the street. TRUE STORY. remember 
those tanks are NEVER empty after they have had propane in them. i know 
everyone is pretty crafty on this list and wouldnt want to hear this 
happening to anyone. you may have done it or know someone who has done it 
successfully but dont take the chance.

the tank should be ok on the rack, but personally i would be too worried 
about it flying off no matter how good it is attached. it would take out a 
car when it hits the ground. you can get a little 5 or 10lb. tank, they are 
nice and small, will fit in any westy cabinet or closet and you wont have to 
keep a window open. should burn for about 5-8 hours. plenty for a weekend. 
the grill tanks are 20lb.ers, too big to haul around. i have a 10lb. in my 
bus withh a hose running to a coleman stove and small round heater.
NOTE: BTW, ALWAYS KEEP THOSE TANKS UPRIGHT
