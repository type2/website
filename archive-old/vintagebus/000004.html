In California at least, dealer plates are issued as an &quot;occupational license&quot; 
and may only be used by the individual or organization to whom issued. A bit 
of trivia, the number on the dealer plate will match the dealer number used 
on the report of sale. Unfortunately if the dealer goes under they need to be 
turned in and destroyed.
