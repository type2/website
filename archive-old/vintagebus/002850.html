I've had nothing but mistakes and problems while installing the baywindow
gas tank in my bus.  I was able to repair my sending unit - although it
wasn't easy and was very tedious, I completely disassembled, cleaned, and
reassembled it and it finally gave me varying resistance readings.  That was
good news to have saved $70 for the price of a new one!

Instead of cutting or brazing the existing banding to hold in the tank, I
found out that I could use a bander crimper.  It's a tool we use at work to
hold steel banding together - the stuff that holds units of lumber together.
I figured that in the future, if I ever wanted to put a stock splitty tank
back in, I could simply remove the clips and convert back to stock.  Good
thinking because I mis-measured and put my baywindow straps on too short so
off came the clips and then I reclamped them back on after repositioning
them.

Of course when I was all done, I realized I had forgot to put my ground wire
on so I molested my bus and cut a hole over the sending unit with a hole saw
so I could reach down and install the wire.  I hated doing it but this area
will get covered in carpet anyway so I'm not too worried about it.  I did
think that I could entitle this post &quot;I molested my bus.&quot; but figured that
put a negative light on things. :-)

Anyway, the tank is all completely installed, the old filler neck from my
non-sending unit tank has been hooked to my baywindow tank so I still have
that nice old stock filler tube, and now I must move on to upholstoring my
parcel tray.  Then I need to install the rubber seal in the engine
compartment, test fire my engine, and then install it.  Once that is done, I
can take the bus over to the heated shop to begin the front end rebuild.

Then to complicate things, my brother offered to let me install the 2161cc
Berg engine from Peter Davy - tempting as it is, I don't think the tranny
would hold up to the torque.

Gotta get to work - thanks for reading.
