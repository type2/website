Subject: continuing saga of 61

bled the brakes, readjusted them, and did a tuneup: adjusted valves, (two 
slightly tight, one slightly loose), filed and adjusted points,  made sure I 
plugged the wire from the points onto the prong of the condensor.   cause the bus 
won't go if that isn't done... it's important.  cleaned cap/rotor, cleaned 
distributor shaft and relubed it (was kinda gummy), put that all back together.  
I had changed the oil a couple hundred miles ago, checked the snugness of the 
10mm cap nuts.  ignored the spark plugs (new 6k ago) oiled hinges, oiled the 
moving bits on the carb.   bent my piece of wire for the manual choke stay into 
an improved shape (the %^#_at_ pin falls out, dumb electric choke) set timing w/ 
strobe light.

took a test drive, the brakes didn't feel much different.  ha ha ha  bus 
feels happier though.

decided to make the tailllights evenly bright... took lenses off, wiped bulb 
holders clean, wiped dust off the 4 bulbs ( euro 62-71lights).   checked 
connections , used dielectric grease, added a ground wire on the left, and most 
importantly, switched the wires around on the left so the brake light is brighter 
than the taillight (duh)  

wiped the grime off the bulbs of the engine compartment light.  brighter now. 
 removed the liscence plate light lense and wiped the dust off it.  put the 
lense back in place :)

decided I wanted both front running lights (the little guys in the 
headlights) to work, so took the left one out, turned out it had a bad bulb.  cleaned up 
the connections, added dielectric grease, put a new bulb in,  reinstalled 
headlight.  works!!! took other headlight out, added dielectric grease for the 
three prong connections.  installed headlight.

jeez, what else?  hmm, maybe  polish and wax the windsheilds.  and dash.   
and install new speakers
