I've also had a problem with the repop seals, most of the problem stemming
&gt;from the fact that they are not *long* enough, so they don't fit
well into the frame.  I couldn't keep 'em in my '55, and I didn't want to
glue them yet, so when I do them for real, I'll use something to stretch 
them into place with sticks or something.
