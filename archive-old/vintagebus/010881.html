was writ:


&gt; 430  ????   B42 Std Westy w/roof rack, pop top and tent   J98 ????

&gt; 080 Walk thru Kombi, LHD only 108 ?????

These are actual M-Codes.  430 is USA Prep (bumper overriders,
laminated glass, red tail lights, etc.) tho not actually
confirmed from VWAG.  108 is part of the Westfalia package, exact
meaning unknown.

my 65 westy has 108, I believe.  It does not have the westy code such as A42,
but yup- westy time.  My feeling is 108 is a kombi painted in the rear cargo
area, as opposed to the grey.
