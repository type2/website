POR-15 Paste worked pretty good.

&lt;&lt;As I have my barndoors floor mat out and it is unlikely I can find a decent 
replacement, and it is old and torn,  anyone ever happily repair one?   I 
hate moving it around.  The glycerin really does help soften it up, much 
better than yesterday it is, but that does not heal rips.  That black rubber 
cement?  superglue?  Anyone done this?


I kinda thought that the guage top temp reading that really did say whoa that 
really is high temp for a bus, like Everette says.  The other oil temp guages 
I have seen have much higher top readings.  But I guess they were not made 
for an ACVW.  Well, I am back to hooking it up now.

 Interestingly, the VDO  oil temp guage with the VW style face dated 5/57
 goes from 30 to 120 C.
 30C is 86F, so you can see it warm up :).
 120 C is about 250F  That was the top of the guage made for VWs.
 &gt;&gt;
 It's my understanding that 250F is the oil temp redline for VWs, both air
 and water-cooled.
