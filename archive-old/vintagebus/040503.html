Well, by order of the Queen(wife), the time has come to repair the original 
but very tired interior of our 66 westy.

Does anyone have any suggestions for someone who is struggling with the 
difficult ethical question of whether to &quot;hack up&quot; the original formica faux 
wood paneling and replace it with birch paneling?(the wife's choice)  Is 
there an outlet for repro westy formica that I am not aware of?

Thanks for the help,

Scott
