I had some errands to do that required a short trip in the bus so I fired it
up and drove it around for the first time in a couple of weeks.  I forgot
just how smooth that little 1776 ran.  The lack of any flat spots from the
34-pict-3/009 combo is really sweet too.

The popping sound was still there although not as pronounced.  I'm just not
looking forward to having to re cc everything and order new shims etc.

All fer now...
