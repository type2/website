Subject: Re: [VB] 64 shift coupler problems

Hi Dan,
Have you tried losening the all the fasteners at the front tranny mount and 
see if the nose of the tranny will pull down and then retighten the fasteners?  
Also would try loosing the rear tranny cradle and see if you can slip it 
upward.  Lastly would measure the bus for rear end damage which possibly bent the 
body tranny horns downward.
