&gt;I have a spotlight mirror on my BUS in need of a new bulb. The current
&gt;one was 6v but I need a 12v. If need be I can make a 6v work, but I'd
&gt;like to get a 12v if possible.

 6V bulb: E 6 V 25 W  per DIN 72601
          VW N 17710 1
          some vendors (eg RMMW) have this bulb

This looks to be a normal single-contact bayonet base bulb.
US bulb numbers that should work:

1680  6.00V, 24.6W, 32.0cp
1133  6.20V, 24.2W  32.0cp (RP-11 glass; not round)

There are others, but they are lower wattage (18W and below.)
Note that this same bulb is specified for the back-up light
(when there was only one) on ambulances.

12V bulb: (E?) 12 V 25 W 
          VW N 17710 2
          some vendors (eg RMMW) have this bulb

US bulb numbers that should work:

 199  12.8V, 28.8W, 32.0cp
2396  12.8V, 28.5W, 40.0cp
1156  12.8V, 26.9W, 32.0cp
1143  12.5V, 24.2W, 32.0cp  (RP-11 glass; not round)
1073  12.8V, 23.0W, 32.0cp

US versions of Euro bulbs that should work:
17635 12V/21W  12.0V, 21.0W, 37.0cp
3497  12.0V, 27.0W, 45.0cp

Again, there are others, but they are lower wattage.

You may want to be careful using the &gt;25W bulbs, as the fixture
may not like the heat.  I think the 27-28W bulbs should be OK,
just don't get crazy and put a 50W bulb in there.  :)  I would
probably try either the 3497 or the 2396, as these should be
fairly readily available, and the 3497 seems to put out a bit
more light, based on the candlepower rating.

Good luck!
