Yes, I've heard about that, and that they were designed that way to be 
stronger aggainst cracking.    Anyone have experience with these?  I mean, 
anyone look at these heads after they were run in a bus for many K miles?  

    PS I dislike the dual carb style intake.   And those 34 picts are 
annoying.  But this SP vs DP may be one of those &quot;which kind of oil is best?&quot; 
or &quot;what beer do you drink?&quot; questions  I swapped the 30 pict on my 61 (1600 
sp) to a 28 pict.  It immediately had more zip.  And I hope to have better 
gas milage, but it's really hard to tell now as I only drive about 4 miles 
each way these days, and let the bus warm up a bit before, so in general I'm 
getting crappy mailage as the bus is idling for as long as it is motivating, 
and swapping the carb didn't make much difference.  Think I'll pop a 30 or 28 
pict on my 65 with the mystery 1600 DP (has a 30/31 on it now).  (I didn't 
build it, but if it runs, why tear it apart?)   Hope to go camping in a 
couple weeks, then I'll have some real gas milage readings. 

I also have a DP motor in my bug.  I got it cheap used, full flow filter, 
doghouse, thermostat, no guages.  I haven't been able to get the #3 spark 
plug out for years, since a certain high speed driving experience.  While I 
don't drive bugster that much, it's still been about 20K miles.  I am sure 
the heads cracked.  Anyway, that is such a smooth motor (has a 8 doweled 
crank, probably all balanced and stuff), and still runs well with cracked 
heads.  At some point when I'm bored I'll pull the motor and put the new SP 
heads I have on it.

 The Mexican DP VW heads come with long reach plugs, indicating thicker
 castings.  I wonder if this might be aimed at reducing cracking.
