Subject: Re: [VB] Indecent Proposal

I agree that the internet acces to VW parts is hurting the swaps... but still 
it's nice to find parts w/o going to a show.

Hello Guys    I think I'll agree with John Baker on this subject. I would 
much rather help the other busers out there than use E Barf   What happens on 
E 
barf is people buying stuff to resell at a higher price   What this does is 
drive the prices up and really doesn't help the other bussers. Also there are 
all 
the rip off guys on E barf  Just about everybody that has gotten stuff from E 
barf has been ripped.  It has also hurt the swap meets at the shows I just 
got back from the Ohio Vintage Show and it was the worse selling show I have 
ever done it was a good thing that the real reason I went to Ohio was to camp 
with the OVT guys  but thought what the hay cover the costs  barely did  .  
Can't 
help but think that E barf and the Samba are hurting the swaps.
