I've used used a punch to put a hole in one, and then pried it on out.  Of
course its now ruined.  Bus boys makes a quality metal replacement at
about $14 ea. (ouch!)

&gt; Its finally time to rebuild one of my redux boxes.  Its long overdue.
&gt;
&gt; I've torn most of it apart, and I'm at the stage where I have to
&gt; remove the plug on the back of the box.
&gt;
&gt; Bentley says to wield a nut on the plug, but I don't have any wielding
&gt; gear.
&gt; Is there any other way to do this?  Would propane be enough
&gt; heat to braze the nut on sufficiently (doubt it)?
