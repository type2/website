Subject: wipers-what do people use

since I saw the other bushing question (sorry cant help there). I 
thought that now might be the time to ask
what or which wiper arms and blades are people using for splitties. I 
have always hated having to look at that wiper blade
while driving, so I took them off and use Rainx. In sw florida I do 
fine.  However I noticed that an after-market part is used by
some (or all of the safari window busses) to swing the wipers down and 
out of the way and attach them to the one eyed duck.

So who thinks that being able to swing the wipers out of view is a good 
idea- am I forgetting something.

So does anybody have any wipers to recommend

Thanks Frank
