I've done the deed.  I finally brought my 66 bus home.  That's right - ol'
No Quarter got his ass in gear and brought the bus home.  Here's the story:

This morning I threw the tools, tires, jacks, and anything else I could
think of that I might need in the Suburban.  It didn't take me long to
realize that the 1 &amp; 7/8's ball hitch I had needed to be a 2&quot; for the bus
tow bar.  So after the gear was loaded, I hit the local farm supply place
and bought me a 2&quot; ball, stopped my my grandfather's house to get the 'real'
floor jack, and off I was - bound for the farm where my bus has sat for a
hair over 4 years.

Upon arrival, the air was quite cool, confirming my suspicions that long
john underwear would lend a helping hand.  Things were unusually serene this
morning with a light a variable wind about 10 to 15 mph.  The first thing I
did was flip open the back of the Suburban and drag out all the gear.  I
soon had the rear end of my bus jacked up in the air.  I had long since
derusted my rear lugs for the 66 and the oil I had soaked them in guaranteed
easy installation.  As soon as the tires were on and the bus lowered on it's
new rear feet, I had to smile like a jack ass - these tires really look
neat - they have that narrow look (195's) that keeps them well within the
fender wells without looking like an overinflated balloon.  Attention was
directed to the front where I knew my work was cut out for me.  Chevy rims
with wheel adaptors and lugs that hadn't been removed since the dawn of time
awaited my twitching breaker bar finger.  Armed with wd40 and a hammer, I
started my attack slowly but surely - a shot here and there and then a
strategically placed hammer blow to help break the firm grip of the rust.
Victory was mine as the chevy rims came off like a knife through butter.
But of course, I couldn't revel in victory too long as the battle was only
half over.  Once again, the wd40 came to play as I shot all of the wheel
adaptor lugs with it, followed by the hammer blows, driving out spiders now
trapped in their own matted webs.  Using a block of wood and a little tranny
jack, I managed to keep the drums from turning (damn those front drums are
wide!) and one by one, I cracked loose the lugs as each one sang a slightly
different tune with a common underlying theme of &quot;don't tread on me.&quot;

Soon the wheel adaptors came off and on went the new tires.  Now I not only
was smiling like a jack ass, I was one!  I just couldn't help but think that
this is the beginning of a long road of travels and bus restoration that I'm
gonna have fond memories of.  I just stood there, took in the moment,
removed my jacket, and bearing the smile of a gay mule, grabbed the towbar.
It was a bit of a PITA to install only because I didn't have a way to safely
keep the front end in the air while I was under the bus so I installed it
ground level.  I'm sure a photo of the situation could be entitled something
like, &quot;Bus Eats Man&quot; or some other over- used yet catchy phrase.

I threw all the gear in the Suburban, and in 3 to 5 tries had the ball hitch
on center enough that a firm ass-plant on the bus hatch caused the towbar to
drop nicely into place on the hitch.  After rigging the safety stuff (chains
and so forth), and putting the bus into neutral, I rolled out.  Man, it
almost brought tears to my eyes to finally see my bus rolling again after so
many years of sitting.  I'm sure that somewhere in that ball of metal, is a
heart that finally beat a couple times in anticipation of the good times to
come.

I stopped on the dirt path that leads to the row of disassembled Chevys and
other dead cars and snapped a nice panoramic shot of the bus behind the
Suburban.  This, my friends, will be a picture worth framing!

A nice slow pace of 15 to 20 mph was achieved as I headed to the outskirts
of town for some gas.  I also grabbed a cheeseburger, a slice of pizza, and
cup of diet Pepsi in firm hopes that it would counteract the grease. :-)  I
worked my way over the grandparents house where they were overjoyed to see
Edith's old bus.  Grandma put on her coat and came outside to look it over.
She's expecting a ride when it's roadworthy.  And of course, my Grandpa got
the job of photo man - shooting pictures of me standing on the towbar and
the front bumper of my 66.  The neighbor guy came over the minute I parked
and told me, &quot;If I start seeing you drive around town with flowers in your
hair and a long beard...&quot; jokingly of course - he's a nice guy and meant no
harm.  The resulting chat ensued and he's also looking forward to a ride in
it.  It's no wonder as it's the only splitty in Gage County, NE that I know
of.

Anyway, I weasled my way back home to install the hubcaps, and went down to
where I work to show the guys.  They couldn't believe it - instant
conversation piece.  I even managed to get one of them to slowly cruise
around the lumber yard in the Suburban - with me in the front seat of the
bus.  My first ride in my bus.  This was the highlight of the day - I sat
back with my hands above my head while the bus steered itself behind the
Suburban.  Total Euphoria - just like being a kid again.  I thought to
myself, &quot;Yep - this is totally me - I'm goin' to California in this bus.&quot;
I just can't put in words the feeling - despite the rough body and all the
misnomers - I've got my bus, it's mine, and everything about it is just so
damn neat - I can't get over it!

Now I'm home, a full 4 and half hours and 10 miles later, writing this.
It's good to be home but I've got quite a bit of work left to do today.  I
gotta move the bug, and then figure out how to move the bus into the
driveway without it rolling out into the street.  I wish you volks could be
here - not only to help, but just to experience the sheer joy of rescuing a
bus.  You'll only know it if you do it.

Thanks for reading!!!
