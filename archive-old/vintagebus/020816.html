Subject: Internet Shopping...

To Bus people far and (as Ellis put's it) Wide.       
                            Ok, I am new to internet
shopping,first time.Buying something you dont get to
see in person first.Ronnie from OldVolks_dot_com and I got
together on the phone today and confirmed a small
order for some axel boots(not the singers) engine
compartment seals and some front turn signal lenses to
get me by until the day of the real resto whenever
that is.For a hermit like me it sure beats going out
into the world to hunt down parts.Now if I can get the
FED-X guy to put them on the bus while I get a nap....
