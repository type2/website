OT related question

In a head nut re-torque scenario, would a stud loose at the case  
not torque all the way to the 23 ft/lbs spec due to friction of the
nut against the head and threads on the head end?

Hence, to coin a phrase, a &quot;floater&quot; stud that 
torques to spec cold, but when stressed by normal operating temps.
and loads, goes out of spec due to loosing at the case end of the 
stud?

Maybe a dab of blue loctite would help? I hear that red loctite 
is permanent and you would have been SOL with your broken stud,
George. 
******************************************************************

Believe it or not Ken, you are perfectly right about the dry nut/thread
friction interfering with correct torgue. Twenty years ago I learned from an
old aircraft radial engine rebuilder here in Seattle to put a couple of
drops of regular oil on the threads. OK, OK, I know what you're thinking,
yes, I thought the same myself. MY GOD, the nut's going to back out minutes
after starting. I was TOO wrong. After the heads heat up to 300 degrees or
so the little dab of oil is burned off and that is that. But like the radial
aircooled engine, I also follow what aircraft engine builders and Gene Berg
said, pull it and retorque 300-500 miles, 20-50 hours on
Continental/Lycoming engines. I've always used oil on the rod studs also.
