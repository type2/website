I LOVE this stuff!
I just coated the insides of my safari frames!
The NOS safaris arent NOS anymore! They are por-15'ed, primed, painted, and 
assembleled!
They will NEVER rust though. 
I taped all the drain holes shut, poured it in one side until it came out the 
other!
Let dry.
I would recomend this to ANYONE restoring safaris or running the aftermarket 
ones.(which have a HUGE tendency to rot after a few years)

&lt;&lt;no cheap sourse but if you look at their site (ijust got my shippment 
yesterday)
they have the six-packs. these are the best to get if you aren't doing a 
major deal like a whole frame.
in my experience those guart cans (any with the normal pop lid) are no good 
if you plan to do a little here and there and then do more at a later date.
the little jars are nice and you only open a lttle at a time.
also the super starter kits they have are great you get everything in it you 
need,
the cleaner,the prep, the por,the brush,and the gloves,for13bucks is pretty 
good if your only doing alittle at atime.
