Hi all,

I'm hoping to locate one Westfalia louver window assembly in nice
condition, complete (well, minus the mosquito screen would be okay) to
complete my set on my 1967 Westy.  I have already restored, polished &amp;
installed four of them with new seals, but my fifth window assembly is
beyond my ability to save.  So if you have an extra one lying around in the
garage or basement that is in nice condition that you can free up, please
e-mail me personally with the details and cost.  I really love the look and
function of the four I already have re-installed, and now I just gotta
complete the job with a fifth one!  Let me know if you can help me locate
one.

Thanks!

Bill Bowman
