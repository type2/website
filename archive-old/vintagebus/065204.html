Subject: Re: [VB] Late Bus Pop Top on Splittie, possible ?

&gt; &gt; Any chance that the Pop top from a 75 Bay window bus would fit a 66
&gt; &gt; Splittie?
&gt;
&gt; With a welder and enough time, *anything* can be made to fit &lt;evil laugh&gt;
&gt;
&gt; But seriously, I think the bay roof is wider.

Poor Richard.
