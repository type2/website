Subject: Re: [VB] Major Body Repairs - Rust

Hi Walter,
If you need to replace the frame members that run left to right under the  
cargo floor.  If the floor is in good shape leave it in  place.  Best to build a 
rotisserie for your bus.  Like:

(http://www.thesamba_dot_com/vw/forum/album_search.php?search_keywords=bus+rotisserie&amp;search_terms=all) 
 
If you have to replace the frame members that run front to back you are  
going to have to build a temporary frame to keep the body from sagging!!   Saw 
images of a bus in Europe that had complete frame replacement and a full  shop 
was needed to do the work properly.
