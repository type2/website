&lt;&lt; so I don't see where the latch problems would be unless you tried to 
change the internal (door) latch because they are different. So in my 
experience most doors are
 interchangable if the original latch is still in the door.(except a mid 64 
and later) &gt;&gt;
Hi Ronnie,
That probably would be it.  We do not have our 1960 panel here to compare to 
our 1963 SC.  If the latch tabs are the same distance from the outer skin 
then they shuld be interchangeable!   Eric&amp;Barb
