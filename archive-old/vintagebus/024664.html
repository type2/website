&gt; &gt;I am still looking for a set of four gray painted hub caps.. NOS or in
&gt; &gt;very good condition. I have looked at all the parts vendors and still
&gt; &gt;would like to have the real cigar for my &quot;58&quot; double door panel van. If
&gt; &gt;any one can help I would be so happy.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; Wolfsburg West told me theirs are NOS, not repros.  That surprised me
&gt; because the color is not exactly the same as one I took off a Commercial Bus
&gt; at the junkyard.  They also said they were almost out of them?

&gt; 
I like Wolfsburg West. They tend to be straight shooters.  But those
caps are not NOS.  They are very nice. 

PS, if you paint them, make sure to remove the primer first, as it seems
to not like to take paint well. Silicon based?
