I got my reservations for friday and saturday, me my 87 westy and 3 year old
daughter (who loves horses!) will be there as well.

Tried your site, could not get to look at the pix - kept taking me to a
comments/email page instead, wanted to check out your sundial. Well I am off to
Knoebel's Grove Park in central PA for a play day with the little one. Enjoy
your weekend !

&gt; I finally posted some info on Busses by the Sea at http://vw.illequipped_dot_com
&gt; Space is filling up fast at the campsites, so if you havent reserved a space
&gt; dont hesitate.  To everyone whos sent me a confirmation I will be sending
&gt; out more info shortly to all of you.
&gt; Please email me if there is anything you think i should address on the site.
&gt;
&gt; vw.illequipped_dot_com news---
&gt; The site is starting to shape up nicely, I have about an hours work left on
&gt; the classifieds section and another hour or so on the links page.
&gt; Something new for the day is the Events section.  Please post all of you
&gt; event there if you have any.  I'm beta testing this and would love some
&gt; feedback.  All previous page errors should be fixed.
&gt; Also, post a pic of your VW if you havent allready and play the Feature Free
&gt; For All game.  Ive noticed the feature image changing often so i guess its
&gt; working fine.  If anyone has any suggestions or would like me to add
&gt; something to the site please email me.
&gt;
&gt; Thanks
&gt; Emmet
