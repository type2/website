Subject: Re: [VB] stripped spark plug hole

Eric&amp;Barb must be rolling in dough !
While it's true that Time-Serts (*tm:) are
preferred over helicoils, especially when
a fastener ( a spark plug in this case )
is to be removed and replaced on a regular
basis, you won't be happy to discover
that it will cost more than you may want to pay
for the special tap ( 14mm sti ) and insertion tools
required to install this $2 gizmo.
You will essentially be in the spark plug Time-Sert
business !! ( or just a good machinist with a jones
for all kinds of tools :) Check your pockets.
There are several manufacturers of generic inserts,
most of which can be instaled with tools you may
already own. An old spark plug and anti-seize
makes a very handy insertion tool. Locktite(*tm:) the gizmo.
I won't argue the superiority of the official Time-Sert.
The garden variety insert can be found at a local Flaps
and will install quite nicely and securely if
proper procedure is applied.

&gt; &gt; I did a quick type 2 library search, and see that Eric &amp;Barb recommend
the
&gt; &gt; Time-Sert insert over the helicoil...am I reading their post correctly?
