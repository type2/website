Hi,

I am not sure if my previous message went through. I didn't
get a copy.

Be sure to check out the fuel pressure. I had a 16mpg
problem when I first installed my carb. After much grief,
the guy at Scat asked me if  I had a fuel pressure regulator
in the line. Sure enough, as soon as I had installed a
regulator and set it to 2-1/2 psi, my mileage went up to
19-21. Fuel was blowing by the float valve and getting
forced through the jets.

Thats it.

Chris
