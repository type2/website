Subject: Tacoma powder coating and seat reassembly

Got my seats back today from Tacoma Powder Coating, wow what nice job
they did, I paid 2 bills for the work (not sure if that is a good price)
and am impressed. I have been assembling them ever since dinner tonight,
So far I have hog ringed the new burlap, installed the new coco pads,
applied a thin felt layer on top of that. I have managed to finish off
the rear seat nicely. I then did the lower half of the short middle seat
but in working on the top I am struggling with the fit. seems I can not
figure out how I pull the ends in and finish it off. does anyone have
experience with this? The seat covers are Wolfsburg West if that
matters.
Thanks
Shawn
