&gt; &lt;&lt; Was it you that was suggesting that you would like to find a circuit for
&gt;  a O2 mixture sensor? I'm referring to an exchange a while back where we
&gt;  were talking about gauges for the VWs. &gt;&gt;
&gt; Hi Paul,
&gt; Yes that was us!  Thank you for passing on the info for this.  We just took a
&gt; look at that web page.  It looks interesting and will see what we can figure
&gt; out.  Now to get a better grasp of electronics!   Eric&amp;Barb

I would GLADLY led my help to any listee needing to work this one out or
questions with same.  Call it a chance to give a little back to the list.  Bring
on the questions!  I am currently adding the sensors in my exhaust manifolds and
will be reading their outputs.  I won't be using the nice bar graph circuit that
the drawing shows, but I used four of those back in 1984 to make a real KEWL
tachometer with green, yellow and red LEDs.  Worked like a champ.
