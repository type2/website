Subject: Re: [VB] Duralube/215,000 miles

I would attribute it to good maintanence.  There was recently an article in
&quot;Oil and Lube&quot; publication talking about a chevy truck that hit the million
mile mark.  The man delivered newspapers/magazines through 3 states, 800
miles, and every fourth trip, he would change the oil (3200 miles).
Pennzoil/Quaker-State gave the man a new chevy, in exchange for his truck,
so they could 'check it out'.  What they found, was an engine with very
little wear.  Bearings, rings, everything, was still within limits.  No
rebuild needed.  The man ran no additives, just kept the oil changed every
3200 miles.

Oil additives were made for one thing, and that's to take money out of your
pocket.  They don't hurt your motor, but they don't do anything for it
either.

Gotta look at it this way.  Every oil company (like any other company) is
trying to make a better product than the competition, in order to succeed,
and stay strong.  If all the magic that is in these additives were so good,
wouldn't engine oil already have these great things added?  Conventional
motor oil already has a standard 7 additives already (anti foaming, anti
corrosion, etc, etc, etc).

Whatever is out there, that can make motor oil better, is already being
used.  And as better 'stuff' comes along, oil is changed (notice how the
rating's always change every once in a while?).  Save your money folks,
don't waste it on additives.

&gt;    I have never heard anything good of Duralube till today. I just had a
&gt; customer walk in with a 1978 Transporter that he got from his father. He
was
&gt; in buying the basic tune-up parts, ie plugs and an air filter. He was just
&gt; on his way out to change his oil and told me that the bus had always had
&gt; Duralube added at every oil change, 215,000 original miles on a Desert
bus,
&gt; I guess it must work or are type 4 engines really THAT good, especially in
&gt; our heat.

&gt; ronnie  very interesting
