Use your Sawzall, but only use the white Lenox or Millwakee blades, 16-20
TPI.  You will dull the blades before you brake one.  In places, you may
need a 4 1/2&quot; angle grinder with a 1/8&quot; cut off blade to grind a small
opening for the blade to start.

&gt;Have a parts bus for the front nose( UN hit ) and for the doors( no dents)
&gt;the W. Yard just put it on the driveway! I have some questions : When I cut
&gt;it up, is there a market for  the walk through seats and floor they sit on?
&gt;the back end I thought I could cut it in front of the corners over the top
&gt;in 1 Big section (roof is rusted out) the cargo floor is is good shape... I
&gt;could haul these to a swap meet  or is it a waste of my time?  Also what to
&gt;use to cut it up ?  I know my wire feed welder will cut up bus sheet metal:)
&gt;but I don't have a gas welder. How about a Circ. Saw with a metal cutting
&gt;blade? I have a sawzall but I think I would snap a lot of blades !  Any
&gt;Ideas would be a big help.       Lloyd in Eureka, Calif
