&gt; i forgot to ask-with this new folter setup-how do i know how much more oil
&gt; to add to the system? just go by the dipstick i guess?

Hi Kevin,
We quickly fill the center exit port of the filter and let it sit with its 
open end up for a few minutes before installing.  This oil soaks the filter 
membrane and gets some oil in it but not so much that is it going to pour out 
of the filter when installing it sidways on its mount.  Make sure to lube the 
filter gasket!  Then fill the sump close to the fill mark.  Once the filter 
is installed and sump filled turn the engine over without giving any gas.  
Once the idiot oil low pressure light goes out you can start the engine.  
Check for oil leaks while engine is idling or if not idling well shut it off 
and check after a minute or two of running.  When engine is shut off and 
fifteen minutes have passed check sump oil level and fill to near full line 
and you are ready to go!  For us going from stock oil system 2-1/2 quarts to 
three to fill both the sump and oil filter/pump.
