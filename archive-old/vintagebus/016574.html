Subject: Spare tire?
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

Hey Volks! I am in need of a spare tire for my 67
Camper. I've been told the size of them are 15's. If
you have any that you think might fit..you can view my
bus at the link below and see what you think. I hope
everyone is having a groovy week.

Take Care,

Greg
