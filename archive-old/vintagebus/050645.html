Subject: Sienna Beige seats in a 1966 DLX Brown mats and under seat rubber?

Trying to figure out if I have OE seat coverings. They have no others
underneath, and have OE cocoa stuffing. But, they are all Sienna Beige,
not two tone in any way. The bus is lotus white over lotus white, and
has the two tone aero baleric panels with chrome trim. Package tray is
sienna beige to match seats.
Were there seat options, for two tone, cloth+vinyl, and another for just
plain seinna beige, all vinyl seats?
Also, I understand I should have brown mats and do have brown underseat
molded rubber for the fornt seats. Are these available for minty
replacements? My current floor mats are black.

Thanks,
Al
