well in fact i took out the pin and the needle bearing cage crumbled and the
pin was grooved, the bushing looks ok,  anyway my old pins were ok , i was
replaceing the spindle because of play in the king pin, im wondering if i
should just use the old pins and cages, these new cages look crappy ,plastic
and have two halves, the old ones were one piece and metal,   anybody ??
&gt;
&gt; In my experience when fitting *new* pins and bushes
&gt; the bush is a tight interference fit but installed using a drift...
&gt; i.e.,  moves in quire smoothly but is tight.
&gt;
&gt; The bearings and pins (greased) slide in (no tapping required)
&gt; but are tight and have no perceptible up and down play.
&gt; I'm wondering whether the bearings are actually going
&gt; to roll in your 'tight' side.
