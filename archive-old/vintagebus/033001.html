&lt;&lt; Hey Volks, I've been told several times to replace and clamp my fuel 
lines. I got in the engine compartment last night and I believe(not being a 
mechanic) that I
 need to clamp the hoses that connect to the fuel filter  as they are not 
clamped as of right now. Is this correct? &gt;&gt;
Hi Greg,
Definitely clamp all connections between the fuel pump and carb.  Clamps 
elsewhere  are optional.  Make sure to only use German fuel line with the 
cloth outer covering and replace ALL every two to three years or any time the 
rubber at the ends start cracking.  Make sure that where the metal fuel line 
goes through the front engine tin is either in it's original grommet or slit, 
slide on and clamp on a 2&quot; piece of fuel line with the slit upward to keep 
the metal fuel line from being sawed to death there.  Plus make sure to 
center punch four or six spots on the body around the base of the outlet pipe 
of the fuel pump and the intlet pipe of the carb to make sure they stay a 
press fit in thier places.   Eric&amp;Barb
