Subject: Re: [VB] Help with tranny from 64 into 59

I take it that this is tunnel case tranny into split case bus.

you should not have to trim  either the tranny or anything on the bus.  you 
do need to remove the front mount from the tunnel case tranny.

are you using a *bus* nose cone and hockey stick?

&lt;&lt; I am try to mount a tranny from a 64 bus to a 59 single.  I purchase one of
those nose cone mounts to adapt it to the 59.  Today I noticed the mount is
not going to line up, because the top rib on the nosecone is hitting the top
of the 59's round mount.  Does this make sense? Anyway, I know I am going to
have to do some trimming.  Do I trim the top out of the round mount on the
bus, or do I trim down the rib on the nosecone of the tranny?

Please Help.
