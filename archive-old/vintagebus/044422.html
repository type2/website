Subject: Re: [VB] My banker said yes.

&gt;The urinal is one of the most used tools in the shop.

Urinal!!!! Hah!!!!! I open the door of the shop and p*ss right out of 
it!!! Makes the grass grow nice and green.

Of course I live out in the sticks....and I'm a Texan.

Seriously...if you guys are serious about becoming a real bus freak, 
you gotta get some property in the country so you can drag VW's there 
without a hassle and make noise, and not lock things up, and 
generally just relax. After a trip back to my old hometown of Austin 
this past weekend, I can't express how much I appreciate the nice 
slow pace of small town rural life. My bus wouldn't last 5 minutes in 
big city rush hour traffic. If you don't believe me, listen to this.

I bought a trailer for $75 in Austin. I was stoked. After 15 minutes 
of ownership some college girl in a brand new ford explorer and 
talking on a cell phone drove right up on it and tore it up some. She 
kept driving forward and pushing the tow vehicle that was filled with 
me and the family. I finally leaned out the door and pointed down to 
the ground yelling at her &quot;your on my &quot;f&quot;ing trailer&quot;. It sucked. The 
traffic there sucked BAD BAD BAD. People angry, yelling, driving 
around mad at each other like it's a contest, nowhere safe to go...no 
way in hell I'm driving my Bus there ever.

Nice to be back home at the bus ranch here in redneck San Angelo TX. 
And believe me....I never thought I'd be saying that 5 years ago.
