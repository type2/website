Found a splitty hanging out in front of some old railroad cars, among a bunch
a old cast iron stoves here in Mass.  Its up on all four tires, the id plate
has the following #'s  216166294.  Is this a '64?  me thinks it's a westy pkg
cuz of the interior remnants.  The roof's been tortured with a plywood rig
that extends it a couple of feet.  It appears to have a old type 3 (I've seen
this type of engine in a '64 notchback) engine with dual (split) carbs.  No
engine tin or air cleaner.  Bench seat in front has been replaced by a bucket
seat of unrecognized origin.  AM/FM saphire, tight steering...  I'm a gonna
barter for this and prolly use it as a parts vehicle.  Anybody give me the low
down on the m-codes w/o hollerin' to look 'em up in the archives?

-cha,

-christian
