Subject: DARTHVW on the road!!!!
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

Well, after a muffler swap, a new battery, some new
gas and a lot of praying, I got ol' DARTHVW out of the
garage and on the streets of L.A today!!

I took her sputtering up to a life-threatening 40mph.
There was about 45 degrees play in the steering, so I
had to keep the steering wheel at a constant move to
keep her in one lane. 

I have a couple of questions:

Checking out the electrical, when I pulled on the
hazard light knob, the right-most fuse (16A red) blew
in an instant.  Does this mean that something on the
other end of that switch is touching metal/ground?
tip: blinkers don't work, nor do the brake lights.

Also: is there any easy way to work on the dash wiring
without removing the package tray? You have to remove
the knee buster and the speedo cable to get the parcel
tray out. P.I.T.A.

I'm trying to get her a little more roadworthy to take
to OCTOfest this weekend. It will be close. Pretty
tough to do with a 10-day old daughter in the house.
