David,

Is this your way of saying there is a difference with resto using OG VW
parts, and say, VW/Brazilian/Mexican parts?  Would you include other
aftermarket components in the second level, or would that be altogether
a third level of &quot;resto?&quot;  I can see the logic.

There certainly needs to be an &quot;all original&quot; OG VW parts resto to
respect, and then go from there.

Curt

If you drill down deep enough, there could never be an 'ultimate'
resto.
There will ALWAYS be compromises, but I think that's why we say
'restored' in the first place.  You say to the dude looking at your
car
at the show, &quot;This thing here that yer lookin at has utilized all og
parts, correct color, blah blah blah... Its restored as close to its
condition as it left the factory as I could get&quot;.  Or, you could have
said, &quot;I built this thing to represent what a hot rod could have been
on
June 15, 1972, all parts are period correct&quot;, or how 'bout &quot;I found a
bunch of pieces and I slapped it together... it's restored to driving
condition&quot;...  If you simply have a plan to build a car with specific
*new* components (i.e. Ronnie) I'd call it a 'custom' or 'driver' or
whatever, since it's not being restored to anything except for it's
capacity to provide reliable daily transportation (no offense Ronnie).

I think we shouldn't get confused to 'maintained with original parts'
and 'restored with original parts' either... 

David
