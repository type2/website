Aside from the price tag, arent 1200 and 13-1600 tough to tell apart?
Stale air 40 horse exhausts have shorter tubes on the back.

&lt;&lt;ok I need a muffler and I got one, it looks like a 40hp muffler but it does

not fit why? (just to describe it a little) my muffler the old one that is,

both the heat risers are connected to the upper exhaust with the left one

has a little tube that comes up and connects to the heat riser that is

connected to the upper exhaust . On the muffler I got the left heat riser is

not connected to the exhaust manifold the little tube has the heat riser

connected to it. but that is not the problem it is the bottom two exhaust

connectors are not long enough - huh I don't know - does anyone know what I

am talking about - just need a muffler and I can drive!
