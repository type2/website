After changing ISP's and rebuilding my system, everything on AIRS is =
currently back up to date. My apologies to those who had to wait, and my =
sincere thanks to the sys admins that helped me with some =
problems.(especially you dave)
  IF YOU DO NOT SEE YOUR NAME ON THE SITE, even though you signed up, it =
has been lost. Please signup again, although I'm pretty sure I got all =
the 40 + apps posted up that were waiting in my mailbox. Please make =
sure you have refreshed, or cleared your browsers cache before sending =
in 20 forms asking why you don't see your name on the list :)
  AIRS is currently up to 360 members with more comin in everyday. We =
currently have ppl signed up in every state in the U.S. EXCEPT for =
DELAWARE, MISSISSIPPI, NORTH DAKOTA,and SOUTH DAKOTA. If you know of =
anyone in these states, please ask them to sign up so we have all 50 =
states.
  Dont be afraid to contact someone you don't know, ONLY If they marked =
&quot;COFFEE/TALK&quot;, They want to meet you as im sure you feel the same.
I'm still waiting for all the - **&quot;I was down on my luck and an AIRS =
member saved my life&quot;** - stories, that people promised they'd send me =
if I did this site, but didn't. I did my part, how bout you?
Thanks to all who have made this a great site and continue to help and =
support the VW community around the world by being an AIRS member.
