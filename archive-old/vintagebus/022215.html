Subject: TI engine (longblock) for sale... or will trade for TIV's
Mime-Version: 1.0

I have a fattened engine for sale (1600 base) reworked to a 2221cc. It has all
of the best items full circle crank, hydraulic lifters, o-ringed case, full
flow, German Case, ported/polished large valve heads, etc., etc., etc.

The list is too long to type on this message, but e-mail me and I will send
you the engine spec sheet in MicroSoft Word format.

After all of this work (work was done by Bernie Bergmann) I have decided a
Type IV unit would be better. This engine has never been run... but I turn it
over by hand often, and I have many of the sheetmetal parts JETHOT plated,
spare parts, (new and used) that will be included in the sale (trade).

SELLING PRICE $2500 or TRADE,

WHAT I WANT FOR TRADE IS: (3) or (4) 2.0 liter motors, TYPE IV (GA)(EA)
configuration, one must be in running condition, the others must be complete
good REBUILDABLE condition. I will also consider other trades and
combinations, but I need a couple motors in the trade. E-mail me back at the
above address (CooledXair _at_ AOL.COM) for your offer or additional info that is
needed.
