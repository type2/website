Subject: RE: [VB] Vent window rivet and OG replacments????????

The rivet for the latch should be a 3mm round head, solid aluminum
rivet.  Length should be around 6-8mm long with a 6mm round head.  I
cannot find anyone to source these but I have found some others that may
be close to original but I have yet to break down and order them to see.
I think the ones from WW have a flat head and are more correct to hold
the latch catch plate to the frame.

Rob asked:

the vent window latch on the passenger side of my '66 Sc has broke and I
have a repo replacement (Chrome though)
does anyone know the size for the rivet replacement as I would like to
have
it before I take it apart!?  Also before I do the Chrome replacement are
there any or the OG black one out there in any ones stash so I could do
them
(both) correctly and OG!
