You need to degrease and roughen up the surface somewhat. I have had the
same experience at times, and it always seems that the surface was too
smooth. The stuff sticks incredibly when you've gotten it down correctly.
I've done my whole underside in it. When you got it on right, it's like a
liquid rock, a hard non-porous shell.
