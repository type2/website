&gt; you dont' need a gas heater for the air cleaner.  Yes the 36hp air cleaners

&gt; least you get a manual choke.  If you are worried about the preheat for the 
&gt; carb that much you can use a bus 40hp air cleaner, they have the pre heat 
&gt; attachement.
hrmm,

I have a 4o horse bus aircleaner then i think... has the metal elbow tube
thingy and hangs down with this little bitty teeny tiny oilbath with a
flap (broken and gone) and hole for preheat.

I was told that if i run it on a 1600 the engine will suck the oil out of
the bath due to its small size, is this true?

thanks,

Steve
