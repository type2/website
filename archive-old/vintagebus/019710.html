In prep for the up coming events, I'm going to replace (finally) the tattered paneling thats been in place of the correct gray door/kick panels.

The PO drilled holes willy nilly and I don't know which one are the original ones.  Does anyone know the correct number and spacing of the screws for the front door panels?  This is pre-65? (with the press in clips)busses with the screws and alum. washers.

Thanks.


Steve
