You know as I recall I have seen another example like this but not sure
if it was from the factory. I will find pics and post them. I actually
like the yellow bottom half. But for the record Sealing Wax Red and
Chestnut Brown was the standard color
till end of 58. If you have ever seen the VW biography on the History
channel they show a sweet shot of 54' Deluxes, Standards and Panels
driving around the factory lot all in line. It's so cool! I'll have to
make a Quiktime of it.

&gt; My 54 deluxe was a logoed courtesy bus for an accounting firm, they
&gt; photographed IBM punch cards for record keeping, the top was chestnut brown
&gt; and the lower was YELLOW of some sort, the ambo fans were also painted the
&gt; same color as the lower half of the bus.
