Hi Kevin,
From our collection of gas heat literature, specificly SW.

 Who called the Bus a station &gt; wagon, was this VW nomencalature or Stewart 
&gt; Warner?
&gt; 
Stewart Warner did, but probably because VW did in many of thier 1960s sales 
brochures.  Models 221, 231, 241, &amp; 231 were considered Station Wagons.
