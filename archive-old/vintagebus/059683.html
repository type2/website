Subject: New BUS!, True story

Hi All,

I got a new bus!  I was so excited when it arrived, I had been waiting for
some time to receive it.  The previous owner told me that it was capable of
running and driving so I hopped in and started to check it out.  But
something was wrong.  I remembered it to be more of an orangey/red color but
it was yellow so I looked closer.  More rust than I remembered started
appearing in front of my eyes everywhere I looked.  I looked under the
rockers and to my astonishment there was NO metal under the one side and the
skin was just some cheap patch job simply hanging there with no
reinforcement behind it.  I frantically looked inside and to my bewilderment
half the floor in the cargo area was gone.  I was standing on the ground
inside the bus!  What went wrong.  How could I have made such a bad decision
and why did I not remember all these problems when I looked at it last
several months ago.  I exited the bus very upset.  Then to make matters
worse, the bus started rolling forward.  I had started the motor and left it
running before I noticed the problems and went frantically checking out all
the rust that I had somehow forgotten about.  I ran after the bus as it
veered across the street.  I had to catch it and pull the e-brake before it
hit something.  Barely missing a street sign and a telephone pole, I opened
the driver side door and pulled the brake handle.  The bus came to a sudden
stop and the lower hinge of the door broke and it hung on the top hinge
swaying.  I was confused, upset, and feeling very tired.  I realized that I
had better get the bus off the easement of the neighbors house before the
police showed up and started asking questions.  I stood there staring at the
bus, the hole in the rear cargo floor area with the ground staring back up
at me and the front door hanging on a single hinge.  Then I remembered that
the bus I was supposed to be getting was another single cab and this was
some sort of kombi, or a standard, or something else but it wasn’t a truck.
My mind raced and my wife nudged me and told me that I really should get up
and out of bed lest we all be late for work this morning.  I let out a sigh
of relief, got up, took a shower and met the morning feeling better knowing
my new bus still hasn’t arrived and it IS a truck with hardly any rust or
other bad problems…  whew.

All the best to You on this fine Monday morning… mine can hopefully only get
better :-)


David
