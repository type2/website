Bet you guys an e-mail dollar that there's wet paint on most of your buses.

Go ahead, write down your guesses on where this can be found. I'll e-mail before I leave work with the answer to this puzzler. BTW, I did mention this a long time ago on the list, but I doubt it'll come up in an archive search.

;) Joe
