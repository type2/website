Subject: BYOB Fri. Night Tacos

 Ronnie will be there representing the LBB's, why no Fri. night  tacos? Hey
Fred, how about a bratwurst taco for Fri night? Keep the Fri night taco
tradition going with an SVII flavor. Wish I could be there to taste one and
help. At least no burnt ass this year, you all watch out for those propane
heaters. If ya get to close to one,  see C of P&amp;C for great first aid. P&amp;C,
plates coming with Ronnie. Beto, take care of Ronnie this weekend, he's all
alone without me (haha). It's a bummer missing one of the great bus shows
(BYOB).
