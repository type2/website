Subject: 1961 Double Cab... 07-31-03

Today, after helping my son repair his &quot;Big Wheel&quot;,  I ended up 
scrounging up the bolts needed to mount the front bumper onto the '61 
Double Cab. Turns out I had plenty of 'em, so I didn't waste time 
going to the hardware store to get nuts and bolts for the rear 
bumper. I just proceeded to mount the front one.

The bumper was still a little tweaked even after working on it 
yesterday, but I used some longer bolts on the side mounts and was 
able to pull it all together. I used some holes already in the bumper 
to mount a piece of angle iron right on the top middle of it. I then 
mounted one of those license plate holders on there. This bumper is 
stripped down to just the blade, so this made a nice way to get the 
plate mounted where I wanted using existing holes.

Not that it mattered, the bumper is ugly anyway. I guess it just 
seemed to make sense to use what was there. I've been doing that a 
lot on this bus. Not making anymore holes or mods to it. But also not 
really &quot;fixing&quot; any of the ones already there. Basically just keeping 
that kind of stuff &quot;as is&quot;.

After getting the front bumper mounted up I sprayed it all again with 
some flat black paint and called it a day. I should get paid 
tommarrow and can think about getting some of the last stuff on my 
list done.

Also made some cash selling an old &quot;claw foot bath tub&quot; we had picked 
up for cheap a while back. Decided not to use it, so put it in the 
Thrifty Nickel. Man those things are heavy! But definitely helps to 
get a slight injection of cash on those last few days of the month, 
especially when you've blown your cash stash on busses and guitar 
amps...the kind of stuff that's priority...right!?!?!?
