Subject: Re: [VB] No Response - 2nd Try: Help Tuning My Bus

oh ya.. I got it mixed up with the  gas law.    But actually gasoline does 
expand/ contract a fair amount with temperature, so why not with pressure?

part of the trick to getting good milage on road trips may be to wake up with 
an empty tank and fill it first thing in the am before things warm up.

roughly the same.

liquids aren't all that compressible.
