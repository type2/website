Orchard Supply Hardware has it.  Chief used to carry it, but AutoZone
bought them, and I haven't seen it in any of the AutoZone stores.

Hmm.  Maybe I should buy out all their stock and the ebay it...

&gt;    OK this is the deal, I went down to 5 local FLAPS and NONE of them had

&gt;waiting for me.  So what gives?  Anyone in Arizona know of a for sure source 
&gt;for this stuff?
