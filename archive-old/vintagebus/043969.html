500 grit is the standard for todays paint systems.  For the very best
adhesion and finish I would highly recommend using the 500.
I have yet to see any problems and I have been using the catalyzed paint
systems for over 11 years now.
250-360 grit is fine for the next to the last step in prepping your
primer.
I'm not saying that there aren't folks who stop at using the rougher
grits, but if you talk to a good paint representative they can give you
the skinny too.

&gt; &gt;From what we have read you really need to use 250-300 grit sandpaper.
&gt; Anything higher will be too smooth and not allow the new coat of paint to
&gt; adhere.  Resulting in paint that not only chips, but flakes off.  Hopefully
