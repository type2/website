Subject: Reduction Box Repair article
Mime-Version: 1.0

I wrote an article in the NEATO newsletter, Old Bus Review, about the 
removal &amp; replacement of reduction box bearings for both 1955-63 and 
1964-67 reduction boxes.

I just placed the 1st page of that article up on the NEATO website at:

http://www.mindspring_dot_com/~deasterw/neato.html

There is a link in the column on the lefthand column of the page for 
&quot;Reduction Box Bearing Replacement&quot;.  I will try to have the other 2 
pages of the article up in a few hours.

I am slowly but surely putting the NEATO website information on a new 
server.  We should be back in business before too long.
