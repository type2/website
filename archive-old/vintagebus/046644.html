&lt;&lt; That would make sense. The front geometry of the bus didn't change between 
65 &amp; 67, so you'd think the arms would fit.
 
 -Wilder &gt;&gt;

there is a nother wiper arm that was installed on 66/67 buses, but it is 
functionally interchangable.  It is actually a better design IMOPBO, than the 
early one.   It has a pinch clamp action, rather than that stupid little set 
screw thang.

FWIW my 65 has one 66/67 arm, and one earlier 60s arm on it.  Although people 
have commented on my bus a lot since I started driving it 4 years ago,   like 
&quot;how pretty&quot; (since it got paint ) to &quot;why didn't you paint the bumpers?&quot; 
(from when the bus got paint until I finally did) to &quot;you lost a hubcap&quot; to 
&quot;what year is it?&quot;  and the all time and current favortite &quot;where's the 
passenger door handle?&quot;, although &quot;your windsheilds are cracked&quot;  is making 
some headway, not once has anyone mentioned my mismatched wiper arms.
