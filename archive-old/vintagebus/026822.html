Several people posted on tents:

&gt;grey floor, blue roof, red/white stripe front door cover over screen,
&gt;external frame

That sounds like the 68-up &quot;driveaway&quot; or &quot;add-a-room&quot;.

&gt;there is no pocket that a sliding door would fit into. Tryed
&gt;it with a '73 Westfalia and had to leave the backside of the tent open for
&gt;the sliding door to function.

Not clear on this - AFAIK you have to leave the back of the tent open to go between the bus and the tent anyway, and the only time you'd close the tent back 
would be when driving away from campsite.  It's not really a pocket so much as a triangular piece of cloth that slips behind the bottom rear corner of the sliding 
door when it's open.

If it has a floor, it's post-67 (ie, fall of 67 and later).

&gt;On Joe Clarks page there is mention of the company White Stag producing a stand
&gt;alone external frame tent.  This might be it.  Don't know really.  Just a
&gt;guess.  Go look his page is required reading.  Cool stuff, if you're into
&gt;campers.

Another discerning reader! ;-)  Note that the White Stag tent is very different from the Westy driveaway, but they're both external frame and freestanding.
