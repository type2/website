Eric and Barb,

Here is a reference for those just coming in
http://www.timesert_dot_com/mtrcsert.htm

You wrote

&quot;Check with the shop with the Time-Sert kit and see if they have the special
order #12159 inserts which are 30mm in length.....&quot;

and I responded

&quot;In your response you spec'd a TS part# that is for an M14x1.5 kit.  &quot;

to which you replied

&quot;Darn!  They must have changed the part number!  &quot;

As it turns out I was WRONG! I misread there parts number listing.

All M12 series kits seem to start with &quot;12xxx&quot; which makes a whole lotta
sense:) All M14 kits start with &quot;14XXX.&quot; I was looking at the last digits
and there was not one listed with &quot;xxx59&quot; in the M12 column and I skipped to
the M14s. This is unfortunately an occupatiional hazzard from my job:) I am
sorry to confuse you or any other list members.

Based on a comparion of part # sequences I would stand to reason the the
part you spec'd is in fact an M12x1.5x30MM.

I have found a source for bolts at a local company called Automotive
fasteners. There are rated 8.8. Will this be sufficient for the
springplate/RGB application?

Inserts will come form Time Sert. The

Info on Time-Sert can be found at

I have no affilation with the above companies other than I plan to use there
stuff to fix my bus:)
