Chet called.  He and Kelley are leaving Wisconsin for the next leg of the trip
to Washington,  Afaik, they're taking the northerly route.  All you bussers
out that way please keep an eye out for a purple to blue and white 67 with a
wrinkled nose, 2 people, and a dog or 2.  They're good people, and need all
the good karma you can spare.

&gt; Dave, problems gone.  You were right. Most of the bottom of the gasket was
&gt; raised into the head, leaving no gasket on the bottom.  Talk about losing
&gt; oil!  Only half as bad as the cooler falling off.  Happy driving--Chet

I'd rather be poor and unknown.  If I were rich the gummint
would take the rest of my money.  If I was famous, everybody'd
be digging in my business.  You don't even know my dog's name.
