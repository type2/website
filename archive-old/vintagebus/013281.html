Hi, 

This is being crossposted so that some of the VB- list with fiche might be
able to offer help!

Got my order from Bus Depot on Saturday. That's right, I said Saturday.
Seems that Ron has switched to using US Mial/Prioity Mail for at least some
of his shipping and the since they work 6 days a week it makes the Wednesday
orders a little less strssfull.

On to the problem. I ordered a headlight switch for the 69 bus and what I
received is part#311 941 531A. Despite the 311 prefix, this is what is
listed on the database for the 69 bus. The spades are a different pattern
&gt;from the original switch which is not such a big deal as they are marked
with circut numbers. There is 3 #30s, 1 #56, 1 #58, and 1 #58b. There is no
#57 which provides juice to the parking light-on light that is in the
instrument cluster. Do I have the wrong switch or is this all that is
available as a replacemet? There is also an odd looking round tab at the
front(FIF) that is bent down at a 45 degree angle. This tab is unmarked so I
am guessing that this is not a connection.

Any help would be appreciated in solving the mystery!!!!
