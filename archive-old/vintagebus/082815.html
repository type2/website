Subject: Re: [T2] We need money

CafePress_dot_com does just this sort of stuff, I believe.

I would love to have a Type2_dot_com sticker of some sort on our bus.

Does such artwork exist? If not, maybe we should have a juried 
competition?

Just my 2.781 centavos.

Your mileage may vary.

&gt; OK - I'm sending in a donation (maybe that is the wrong word).  I've
&gt; mentioned this before ... why don't we have say ... ball hats 
&gt; type2_dot_com - or
&gt; vintagebus_dot_com ... or sell that bumper sticker ... 36 HP Please just 
&gt; pass -
&gt; type2_dot_com - etc.. I'm sure guys like busdepot or type2parts could sell 
&gt; it
&gt; and donate the profits to the list ... then the list could be self
&gt; supporting.  Clearly - guys like busdepot get great benefits in terms 
&gt; of
&gt; advertising their stuff - and I'm sure they make healthy donations as 
&gt; well -
&gt; but still - I would love to buy a few of those old bumperstickers ... 
&gt; I'd
&gt; pay $10 or $20 for each ... I'd happily over pay if I was supporting 
&gt; the
&gt; list.
