I can't, but you might wan't to try Dawn _at_ PLF VW! Her work is amazing and 
you have a choice of original patterns of fabric in a great weather-made 
fabric!
I have her Sundial repro tent in red/white striped and it's very well 
made.(actually half of mine is setup and can be seen on her site w/ out the 
sides) 
contact Dawn and see her work _at_---       www.plfvw_dot_com        ------
-BTW, I have nothing to do with her business, I'm just a happy customer:)

Hope this helps and Let me know how it works out!
