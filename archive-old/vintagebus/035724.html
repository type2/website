I have just finished my 66 13 widow deluxe. It had it's first day at work 
Wednesday.
 I have been driving it to do Pasta delivery's and noticed some gear oil 
leaking out from the passengers side rear wheel (spinning out from the hub 
cap). I'm pulling the drums this weekend to do the brakes what are the 
chances Iv'e just got a broken seal and maybe a bad outer bearing ?

make sure it t gear oil, not brake fluid,  you can smell the gear oil sweet 
aroma  :)

Gear oil leaks at the wheel,  are often from the rear seal .  Means pulling 
the drums, the brake shoes and cylinder and the rear seal cover and changing 
the seals in it and gaskets.

drain the gear oil in the RGBox before pulling the seal cover off or it will 
just go everywhere in a big mess.   New seals are cheap (circa $5).

Clean the drain hole in  the cover, so next time if it oozes, it will go out 
the center side of the backing plate, away from the shoes.   Odds are your 
shoes are soaked, replace them if so.

Been oozing one side of my 61, but not INTO the brakes, as that channel was 
clear, and I delayed maintenance as I planned to pull the tranny and even 
repace RG bearings as there was shavings :(

BTW, still no progress on that tranny pull , no time yet,  but If needed I 
will cut the hockey stick rather than anything else as it is most replacable.
