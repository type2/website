Subject: Springplate-Reduction Box Bolts: An Observation

The following is a report about my recent experience
with stock original vs. current production hardware
for springplate-to-reduction box mounting. All
threaded holes were clean and no threads needed any
kind of repair to them.

When I was returning my bus to service after abut 30
years off the road, I decided to try using original
(but excellent condition used) locktabs and original
17mm headed 12X1.5X24mm springplate-to-reduction box
bolts. I wanted to maintain the original look. On one
side I used the original hardware, on the other I used
current production 12X1.5X25 grade 8.8 bolts with 19mm
heads and spring washers (washers specified by VW as
service installation/supercession in part over the
locktabs).
Recently I have noticed a small &quot;clunk&quot; every once in
a while when first starting off from a stop. I thought
it may be the beginnings of fulcrum plates wearing
out, but the &quot;clunk&quot; was too loud and started too
suddenly to be progressive wear on the fulcrums.
So I decided to make sure that all the wheel bolts
were tight (they were), the axle nuts for the drums
were torqued correctly (they were), and that the front
trans mount was secure (it was). Then I checked the
shock mounting bolts and they were slightly loose, but
not enough to make a &quot;clunking&quot; noise. Then I checked
the front springplate-reduction box bolt on the side
that had the original hardware and it was loose. This
bolt was secured with a 12mm split lockwasher as per
original. So I bent back the corners of the original
locktabs and guess what, ALL the bolts were very
loose, as in I could move them relatively easily with
a 1/2&quot; drive ratchet and socket. They definitely had
NOT retained their torque. I torqued them up, and then
decided to check the other side, the side with the
current bolts and spring washers. Well, much to my
surprise (and happiness), they were all AT correct
torque settings, not even slightly loose.
The clunk has now gone away now that everything is
re-torqued.
So, just as an observation, if you are driving your
bus every day, like I do, and you have original
hardware and locktabs, you may want to check your
torque often. I only put about 9500 miles on the bus
since installation, so it didn't take long for the one
side to loosen up, less than a year.
For a factory LOOK on a vehicle that may not be driven
alot, then I'd say go for the original look.
BUT, for a driver that sees daily use, I'd shy away
from original and get current hardware. There IS a
reason VW superceded the locktabs and specified spring
washers.
I am also going to get the correct spec Grade 10.9
bolts and spring washers and replace the original
hardware side ASAP to avoid future problems.
