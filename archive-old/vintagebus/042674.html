&gt; One more thing...are there dog house flaps and non dog house flaps?  I have a

As far as i can recall,

Everythign is the same except for the spring that connects to the shroud
(i think not sure on this one) AND the connecting rod between the 2 sets
of flaps.

In house is flat and doghouse has an offset bent in to it.

take care,
