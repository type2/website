Subject: RE: [VB] JCWhitney tie rod removal tool - not worth the money

&gt; From: Conrad Klahn [mailto:conradk_at_mac_dot_com] 
&gt; Just for the record, this tool is worthless in my opinion. ...
&gt; It is hard to keep mounted on the joint/union area.
&gt; The bolt that is used to push out the tie rod bolt, 
&gt; spins off when tightened ...

I agree. I somehow got the bracket part to keep from slipping off (I
think this sounds like the same sort of gizmo I bought from them), but
the bolt actually bent when I tightened it and the tie rod end still
didn't come out, and the whole thing slipped off eventually anyway. I
had to just use the old-fashioned fork, maybe with a little expansion
from a propane torch (I was past worrying about being destructive!).
