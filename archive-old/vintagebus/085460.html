Subject: Hubcaps, lost one, twio.

Hi,

Whats the secret to keeping hub caps on the wheels? I've lost 2 in the last 
2 months. They go flying off on the freeway!. Luckily they missed all the 
other traffic. I've looked at my clips and they all look OK. ARe the repro 
caps shaped a little different from OEM and they don't hold on as well?

Help. I don't want to hit someone with a cap. If all else fails I guess I 
can remove them before taking a drive.

Thanks,
Chris
