Ed O'Donnel sez, and I've learned this to be oh so true: &quot;The more shortcuts you take to save time, the more time you will waste until you do it right.&quot;  Just pull the motor.  It's such a cake walk on a split anyway.  Sometimes I pull my motor just for the hell of it.  In and out in an hour, wow!  Couldn't do that on my old 75.
