Subject: Re: [VB] Freeway Flier, formulas

GADZOOKS! And here my significant other was pestering me over the new
Smithsonian Mag article on Pi... little did I know that THAT issue is
practically fiddlesticks compared to trannymath.
Let alone the Nova episode on parsing the Magellan data on Venus  - trannys
are harder than 5 billion years of geology:)
Anyone wanna make a webpage with ALL the competing formulas and we can all
PlugAndPlay with our own data and see what works for us??
