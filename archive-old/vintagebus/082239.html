&gt; I checked out a bug recently. It was only $1200, &quot;Daily driver. Great

&gt; squish of oil and wet carpet. The entire bottom of the engine looked 
&gt; like the Exxon Valdeez.

reminds me of a 21 window that I checked out for $2500 a few years ago. 
They guy said that the cargo floor only had a hole about the size of 
foot in it. The bus must have been missing like three square feet of floor!
