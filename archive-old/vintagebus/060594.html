Subject: Bus sights in a movie!

Hi Volks,
Just been watching and old movie called &quot;Skelleton Coast&quot; filmed about 1964.  
We spotted one blue and yellow Luftansia VW bus from the left engine vent 
rearward after the hero in the movie gets off a Boeing built Luftansia jet.  
Next was complete rightside driveby shot of a blue with white top Kombi with 
the rare AC hump on the back of the roof, when the hero was chasing a guy 
through town on foot!  Otherwise the movie is a slow one.....
