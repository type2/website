Prolog.
I picked Steve D on sat night from the retirement commune in west palm. He
was easily 30 years under the median age. 
Act 1.
Back home for hanging out
as his flight out was (not as it turned out) on sunday noon.
As we were hangin talking and computing we both admired the slow vehicle
symbol that was on the back of a bus that he took a pic of at everybus.
Wheels spinning... check out the new idea ...

Act 2.
I woke him up sun morn with some cafe con leche and took him on a
tour of the studio before dropping him at the aeropuerta. We got just a
little entertainment from the leftover police patroling for more elian
troubles. 
Epilog.
Steve calls me from the airport a couple hours later and hes on standby
for a couple of later flights...His agent had booked the return ticket for
next sunday.
Im hoping he got home by now as I havent heard from him again.

Lemme know what you think of the new logo Idea.
