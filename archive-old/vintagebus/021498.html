You never know who you will find on the list.  Hi I'm Erik and I am also a
service manager at a tire shop.  205/75r14 tires are technically only 2 cm
wider than a 185/75r14and about 3/4 of an inch taller.  As tire nomenclature
goes the first number describes how wide a tire is in mm.  the second number
is the percentage of the first number that the tire sidewall is. the third
number describes the rim diameter.  For those of us who run a metric tire ie
165r15 there is no middle number and the sidewall percentage is considered to
be 82.  so a 205mm wide tire with a sidewall of roughly 150 mm on a 14 inch
rim should fit just fine.
