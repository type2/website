HA HA HA  Quite the comedian these days Jerry.  They actually are a great 
company, and for the record, I have personally never disconnected my speedo 
cable.  I wish that I drove any of my busses more than 2500 miles a year, but 
i don't.  Listen to what this company did, I had 150 CD's stolen in October.  
They had me list the CD's and within two weeks they had replaced over half of 
them.  The ones that they couldn't replace, the wrote me a check for $15.99 
apiece!!  No deductible.  They are teamed up with USAA, and any any company 
that is lucky enough to team up with USAA is a damn good company. I really 
recommend them to anyone who can stay within the milage requirements.  Drew.
