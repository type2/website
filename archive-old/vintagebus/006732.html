I haven't washed my DD since I painted it over a year ago, really waiting
for the paint to cure, shouldn't be to much longer now in our 115 degree
heat.

I'd wait.  It shouldn't need wax yet anyway.

Depending on the type of paint, it may not be fully cured yet.

&gt; Hey all--
&gt; My '59 panel will be coming home to me friday after a 13 month
restoration. 
&gt; The paint on it was applied about 30 days ago and I was wondering if I
should 
&gt; wax it?
&gt; If so, what are the best detailing products? Should I wait?
