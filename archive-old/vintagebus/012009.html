I have been looking for '65 Kombi upholstery too, but have been told it is not out there.  TMI products, at www.tmiproducts_dot_com manufactures upholstery, some of it is original.  They claim a lifetime warranty, and a bunch of other stuff. I just got their catalog. They don't sell directly, but they make a lot of original VW upholstery.

Anyone have any feedback on TMI products.
