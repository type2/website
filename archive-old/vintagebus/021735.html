Howdy-hi Volks and Happy Holidays to you and yours! Anyone happen to
catch a glimpse of the Splittie in the ad for JCPenney about of all
things, thumbs and the tie in to a shirt they sell. Wild paint job.
While it's still Fri. Has anyone noticed the overhead view, line drawing
of at least two busses and the odd Beetle in the flier you get at Carter
Lumber (Mid-west area building supply) for their Garages? Forgive the
rambling, too much eggnog, sugarcookies and dreams of presents for my
VWs and me.  Mark Saginaw,Mi.

Speed Kills...Drive a classic VW
