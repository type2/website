Subject: Re: [VB] dual solex carbs (scat kit) got a few problems

----- Original Message ----- 

&gt; I have the dual carb kit that ronnie (thanks ronnie!) has set up. For
&gt; those who don't know; it consists of the 35mm dual solex carbs and scat
&gt; manifolds and scat linkage.  The kit is very nice and the manifolds seem
&gt; pretty nice.  Being a total dual carb newbie I have run into a few
&gt; problems (I think all that have to do with the linkage &amp; accel. cable)
&gt;
&gt; 1) The pivot mechanism that connects to the control arms has a metal
&gt; piece that is meant to screw in to the lower left screw on the fan
&gt; backing plate does not easily fit and when it is screwed in the control
&gt; arm for #1 &amp; #2 cyl rubs/hits it.  I am unsure why this piece is needed
&gt; as the pivot mechanism is screwed into the engine case.
&gt; Note: The control arm for #3 &amp; #4 cyl almost rubs the fan shroud

The linkage needs to be modified so that the 3/4 side will clear the fan
shroud. As it comes from Scat, it doesn't clear (how they let that one go, I
don't know). The bracket does need to be attatched to the fan shroud for
stability or you will end up with linkage that keeps coming out of
adjustment. FWIW, all Scat carb kits we sell we modify the linkage so that
it will actually work as a &quot;bolt on&quot; so no modifications on the customers
part is needed.

&gt; 2) Here is my real problem, my accelerator cable does not return very
&gt; well and the pedal sticks to the floor.  I removed the cable and greased
&gt; it up and replaced the gas pedal lever pivots to no avail.  This is a
&gt; belly pan (dd) bus so I can't really determine whats going on with the
&gt; tube but in the front it seems bent a bit?  I had a problem occasionally
&gt; with it sticking before with the single 34pic but the lever action and
&gt; stronger? spring seemed to overcome cable resistance better.  Should I
&gt; ream out dirt/old grease in the tube with a clutch? cable and a drill?
&gt; I can't drive the bus with it like this and it makes syncing the carbs
&gt; seem a little futile.  The linkage returns fine when I move it on the
&gt; pivot mechanism from the engine compartment and I can get things pretty
&gt; well synced. (things move fine when accel. cable is not part of equation)

You need to install a return spring in the system. If you are running an
alternator, the easiest way is to drill a small hole in the outer lip of the
alternator, and connect a pull-spring between that and the lever arm that
the throttle cable attatches to. You can put the spring anywhere you want
really, but this is the most common. The return springs on the carbs are
only for the accel. pumps to work properly, not to return the carbs to idle.

Other than these two minor details, the Scat kits are VERY nice, especially
for the price.
