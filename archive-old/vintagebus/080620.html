Subject: Re: [VB] Bus nose furniture

...........
&gt; We would like to turn the nose into a bar for the family room.  Has
&gt; anyone done something like this before?  Would you share your plans with
&gt;

Crofty/Sean- Didn't you make/post pics of one of these?

I've got a complete nose that I'm  saving for the same thing-
Headlights/turn signals that work, &quot;sort of&quot; safari windows for the bar top,
Could really impress you bus friends, shock the rest of your visitors.
