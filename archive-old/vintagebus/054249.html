I didn't have to get insurance, just bring in the title and have a check 
ready to pay the tax and fees

&gt; &gt; I recently purchased a bus that has been sitting for 12 years.  It
&gt; &gt; has plates, but the registration sticker is too deteriorated to read.
&gt; &gt; I have a hand written bill of sale.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; What is the best approach to take with the DMV to get it registered?
&gt;
&gt;From my experience and failing memory, you obtain insurance first, and
&gt;take the rear plate, bill of sale, and yourself into the DMV, and tell'em
&gt;you bought it, and you need to create a new pink slip, and get it
&gt;registered. Take some blank checks too. That oughta do it.
