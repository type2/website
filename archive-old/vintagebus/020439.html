The List is dying because the breed isn't dying.  This is the life,
volks!  Even my 3 year old longs for a ride in daddy's bus when she's
been scooting around town in a '92 Subaru.  A/C Power everything,
automatic, low miles. So what!  Even my '97 Passat Wagon GLX VRX could
get boring on road trips, but the everlasting micro is fun.  Nothing
great comes without a little work.

Keep these types of stories coming!

This is what makes the maintenance and the parts wearing out and the
leaks and the cold and the... well, you know.  LOVING your drive to
WalMart or the grocery store makes it worth it.
