&gt;this program. Porsche bought Stoddard Imports back east and uses them as 
&gt;the
&gt;distribution point for the Porsche NLA program. I do hope that VW follows
&gt;suit as the parts coming out of the NLA program are as good or better then
&gt;ORIGINAL and are accepted in all CONCOURS judging.

&gt;ronnie   hoping for the future
