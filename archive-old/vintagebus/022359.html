Help a brotha out?  Gimme a f***ing break.  If your title is jacked, do the
legal thing and take your sorry a** to the DMV and work it out.  A VIN swap
is illegal, unethical, deceptive, and just plain wrong.  And if you're over
the age of 10, you should know it, too.  If you can't get the title sorted
out legally, then I'll bet ya dollars to donuts you got yourself a stolen
car on your hands.  I live in CA, the world's capital for beauracracy, and
yet I've *always* been able to get title problems sorted out.  Legally. 

This will be my last post on this subject, because frankly, it's a waste of
list's time, not to mention the fact that  what you're proposing is nothing
but WRONG.  Period.
