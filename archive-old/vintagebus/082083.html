man, just keep bugging the guy to sell it to you. tell
him you will come get it after closing hours, and wont
even need him to make out a bill of sale. i do not
know where you live, but if your state doesnt require
classic vehicles to be titled, then you shouldnt have
a problem at all! if it does, here in georgia you
dont, and im sure we can work something out to where i
can get it registered here, then send you a bill of
sale and registration to you, so you can have it
titled??? DO YOUR BIT, SAVE THAT SPLIT!!!
