&lt;&lt; Sorry guys, this has very minimal bus content, and on the surface might 
appear as a spam.  But all of you who know me realize that this couldn't be 
the case.
 
 I've run out of decent bus parts to sell on eBay, so I've thrown up two of 
my treasured Coca Cola coolers to be auctioned.  I only need a few dollars 
more to guarantee that the Westy will now be painted, so I'm digging into the 
&quot;I love this but don't really need it&quot; boxes.
 
 Anyway, the coolers are on eBay and us bus folk love an old cooler to 
compliment our vehicles, so check 'em out.  Sorry to say I had to put 
reserves on them.
 
 Thanks for tolerating my auctions and advertising.  My ramblings I'm sure go 
unnoticed.

 And while you're visiting e-bay, check out my fine line of Hot Wheels 
Redlines and other automobilia auctions by screenname &quot;normsgarage&quot; . My 
auction proceeds too benefit my '67 westfalia.
