     When mig welding the drivers side rocker panel together, I purchased an
offset flange tool from Eastwood.  After the offset was done, we tack welded
the rocker in several places across the seam first.  After we completed that
process, we ran a series of 1 inch beads across the seam.  PLEASE NOTE:  To
keep the panel from warping, you must do 2 things.  1)  Constantly change
welding points until you have completed the task.  This keeps you from
applying too much heat to one area.  2)  Have another person sit inside the
bus with an air gun to quickly cool the weld after each application.  Then we
grinded the welds down.

    We then drilled a series of holes at the bottom flange of the rocker.  I
believe we used a 1/8&quot; drill bit.  We then clamped the bottom of the rocker to
the bottom lip of the inner rocker.  Then we welded the holes.  This gives the
effect of factory spot welds.

    This process seemed to work very well, all things considered.  It was a
long process, but it kept the integrity of the panel. 

Hope this helps-
