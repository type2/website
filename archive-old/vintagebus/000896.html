When I start my 66 bus in the morning, I have a hard time getting it to warm
up and idle.  While I am giving it gas to keep it running, it often
backfires up through the carb.  Once it warms up, I do not experience this.
I will be adjusting the valves tomorrow and changing the points, plugs,
wires, and condenser but thought I would see if anyone thought I was missing
the real root of the problem.

Thanks,
