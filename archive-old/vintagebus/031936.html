I have a 65 dbl door panel. It has a single port 1500 I believe. No
numbers on it to verify. Though it looks stock I believe it has been
modified internally. The compression runs in the 150-170 range. Maybe a
cam and flat top pistons? Runs great except when cold. Even when I let
it warm up 4 or 5 mins it still dies when stopping till its been driven
awhile. I llive in the NW so outdoor temps are mild. 40-50 degrees. The
auto choke checks out fine and mixture is ok. It has a Solex 30 pict 2. 

What I want to know is there a better carb that I can bolt on? Most
performance carbs I see are for dual ports. Also considering updating
the distributor? Any suggestions?

after starting it up  get out of the bus, open the engine lid and look at the
manifold just under the carb.   Is it getting ice formed on there?   This is
called carb icing, very prevalent in high humidity at temps just above
freezing to somewhere in the forties.  Which is the PNW except in summer.  It
makes the engne sputter and run funky and even stall, until things have warmed
up enough  in the engine coompartement to counteract the icing.    Do you have
a preheat tube?  This tube runs off the air cleaner down  through the rear tin
and picks up warm air from next to a cylinder head.THis preheats the air
through the caarb and manifol and counteracts the icing.   You can pick up a
new tube for circa $3, andeven if you dont have the little metal pickup that
bolts where the muffler bolts on, just send the pick up end of the flexible
preheat tube to the area abve the under tin but below the push rod tubes and
you will notice an intstantaneeous improvement.


yes your compression is very high.  But if it runs well, I'd not mess with it.
