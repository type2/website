&gt; Scott,
&gt;
&gt; I learned to drive in my bus. They are a great training ground.
&gt; Especially in San Francisco with all those hills. Learned to hook my
&gt; front wheels over the top of hills at at stop light to keep from
&gt; rolling back. See if your daughter can do this in Signal Hill.
&gt; Yuck Yuck.

&gt; &gt; Theresa, my 16yo daughter has been regularly driving my '60 DC, and
&gt; has
&gt; &gt; stepped it up over the last month.  Been watching her skills
&gt; increase on
&gt; &gt; a daily basis, no more wishing for the nonexistent passenger side
&gt; grab
&gt; &gt; handle.  :-)
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; One result of all the &quot;truck driving&quot; is that when she gets into my
&gt; &gt; wife's bmw, she becomes SuperDriver.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Today, we finally got her '71 SB together, carb tuned and brake
&gt; lights
&gt; &gt; working.  We jumped in and went for a spin w/me driving just to make
&gt; &gt; sure all systems were go after our extensive list of work over the
&gt; last
&gt; &gt; few weeks.  Steering checked out fine, brakes great, suspension
&gt; hmmm...,
&gt; &gt; then tried it on the hwy and these things, get up and go!  We pulled
&gt; &gt; over and she spend the next couple of hours driving her car around
&gt; for
&gt; &gt; the first time.  Of course she had to drop by some of her friends
&gt; &gt; places, then finally home.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Next friday, she has an appointment for her driver's test.  I guess
&gt; I
&gt; &gt; feel fairly safe with her driving after having all those hours
&gt; behind
&gt; &gt; the double cab.  Learn in something hard, then the rest is a piece
&gt; of
&gt; &gt; cake?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Scott
&gt; &gt; '60 DC
