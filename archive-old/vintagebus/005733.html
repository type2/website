Front tranny mount has probably failed. To check, put the jack under the
nose of the tranny and jack it up ever so slightly and try your shifting.
Cured? Bummer for you. Dirty weekend ahead of you. And no, you don't want to
drive it like that. Not so bad a job, just a lot of work. Replace your
ground strap while you're under there. Have fun....

&gt; At home, engine off, will shift into all gears reluctantly when
&gt; engine
&gt; off.
&gt;
&gt; 2) Shift lever making noise for a few days. Sounds like computer
&gt; hard drive
&gt; when reading a big file. Small up or down pressure on lever makes
&gt; noise
&gt; go away.
