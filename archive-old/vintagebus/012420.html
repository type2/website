  Well 6 replies told me to use wheel bearing grease, which is what I've 
  always used BTW. The reason I wondered is that I was never happy with   what
the bearing grease looked like when the drums came off. Todd and   Cal both
suggested Permatex anti seize in the grey(silver?) pkg. Reasons   that it
wouldn't dry or wash out like grease. That seems like a good   reason to me so
I'm trying it.

Any synthetic grease will do in a stagnent use like that. I think that maybe
the reason why you don't like the way the grease looks when you take off the
drum (black and sort of dried out, I presume) is that the oil from the grease
has evaporated. Petrolium based oils actually have a vapor pressure in normal
atmosphere, i.e. they can evaporate albeit very slowly. I'm not sure, but I'm
thinking that the synthetics don't evaporate at all. Also, they have a higher
effective working temperature. I was told this, but I found out for sure when
I was trying to keep a table fan oiled. Stay with me on this - I oiled the fan
one time, and about 12 hours later it started to squeal loudly again. &quot;Damn&quot;,
I thought - I just oiled it not too long ago! I thought the oiling would be
good for at least a couple of months or longer. On taking the thing apart,I
found that the motor runs incredibly hot - I think it is a bad field and is on
its way out. But it was a vendetta to me to find out how to keep a fan like
this one oiled. (Surely there would be a use for the knowledge that I would
gain from this...) I tried electric motor oil, engine oil, transmission oil,
Marval Mystry Oil, hypoid gear oil, sewing machine oil, and even various
greases, cleaning the shaft of the previous lubricant before each application
of the new oil or grease. All of these burned to a crisp (carbonized) after
about 12 hours of operation. Aha!- carbon, eh? So I tried Mobile 1 synthetic
oil. It has been running for about 4 months on one oiling. It doesn't
carbonize.  Also, it didn't evaporate.  Stupid time-wasting experiment just
for a fan?  Probably. But I learned something - I guess the hard way.  If I
threw the fan away prematurely, I wouldn't have really found out first hand
about different lubricants.  I'm sure there is a lot more to learn about them.

 I was told something else about synthetics - they don't collect moisture as
much as the petrolium based lubricants. A good reason to use it in a
stationary application such as an axle spline. 

The permatex is excellent stuff, even though you don't need the &quot;anti-sieze&quot;
part for an axle spline as this really refers to high temperature applications
- 300F or more.  True, the non-ferrous particles in antisieze will aid you in
low temperature applications to a certain extent as well, but you'll probably
find that if you put synthetic grease on the spline, you will get the same
results. At least I do. (I had the same &quot;crummy grease&quot; complaint. I didn't
change grease types for that reason, but it was a nice side effect - to have
well greased splines after many miles!) Just my $0.02 worth.
