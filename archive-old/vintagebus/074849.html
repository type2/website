Hi Steve,

From underneath its just 'penetration'. I leave
a 1mm gap at the join and 'puddle' along....

Are there 'safe' epoxies without isocyanates that you can use without 
requiring air fed masks etc?  All the commonaly available two packs here seem to
be so....

Did you weld both sides of your cargo floor seam or am I seeing that wrong?

Why not save yourself a step and some money and shoot epoxy primer with
a dulling additive.  It is water proof and will have that flat look
you're going for.  Street rodders do it all the time here.
