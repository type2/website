Subject: Re: [VB] My pics are up - engine Q's

B case- larger oil passages, but earlier alloy.    If it ain't broke don't 
fix it, but if the case is shot I'd get a later alloy case. - like the A 
prefix ones.

 I'd adjust the valves and change the oil regularly (even if it's only after 
40miles if it's dirty already) until it stays clean.  
I'd ditch the filter on top and put a oil bath on it(need triangle bracket or 
substitute) and also hook up the fresh air tubes, it does have heater boxes.  

I'd also replac ethe fuel line, and make sure it doesn't lean on the preheat 
of teh intake.   The preheat gets hot, you know.

Corner window buses are stylee  :)

 tell me about this engine... your thoughts please. Seems like something's 
missing.
 
 This is the one that I need nose skin for. Nose skin with driver side door 
jamb (front jamb with
 hinges).
 
 Thanks,
