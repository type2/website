Subject: Re:  Fridolin

Here is a photo of a Swiss version of a Fridolin that I restored several
years ago. The Swiss version is different and rare compared the the German
Type 147--The Swiss model has corner windows--jail bars--and correct roof
rack--I brought this over from Europe--With FREE rust--As &quot;Freddy&quot; was being
unloaded in America--A piece of the body fell off that was siliconed
on--Right then, I knew I was in trouble--But the result was VWonderful  My
Thanks to the Westfalia Museum for all the photos they sent. Westfalia is
were Fridolins were built.
