Subject: Exhaust Paint

I sanded the factory primer/paint off of my stock muffler and plumbing ,
carefully cleaned &amp; painted them with Eastwood's high heat paint a few
days ago. Well, it's peeling already and I expect bare metal just in
time for winter. I probably should have had them bead blasted then
performed some sort of voodoo rite before applying the paint (which
leaves nasty brush marks by the way). I'll save my 30 clams next time
and by some VHT.

I saw a new VW commercial last night which had a dog staring at a fan,
then he jumped up on a chair to have it blow on his face. Is VW telling
us they're bringing back air cooled engines? ;)
