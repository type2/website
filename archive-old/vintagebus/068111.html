Subject: dual 34 PICT

If any of you remember from awhile back I was trying to find out if using dual
34 PICT-3 would be a more inexpensive alternative to dual baby dells. Well,
evidently I haven't been looking through my catalogs enough because CB
performance sells the kit, intakes and all, and has been for awhile. Oh well,
just proves that what one person can think of another already has.

I am going to try out a pair of type-4 34 PDSIT-2 carbs on Kadron intakes
though. Since a lot of BAY people are dumping them they are cheap to get and
the rebuild kit is only $15. Just a little honing on the bowl surfaces and
possible rebush on the throttle plate should make them serviceable. I want to
stick the 1835 in the SC and put the 1641 on the trike while I build a 1904.

Speaking of the SC, anyone have any difficulty getting the big 46mm axle nut
loose for doing brakes? Have had the fronts on since last winter but really
need to do the rear. The rock under the wheel, even with the emergency on,
isn't a viable way to park!
