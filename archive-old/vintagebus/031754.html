    I'm in a GREAT mood.  NEW  ATE  67 only master cylinder, $161.95, I
bought a bunch, won't last long, just thought I pass the savings on. Update
or replace that master now.  Also I still have a few of the GERMAN 
Coline 67 and earlier hard line (brake) kits left, there were 100 of these
made and only 50 made it to the U S of A.
