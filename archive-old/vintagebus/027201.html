Subject: Hole above engine bay.

Hi all,

One of the PO's cut a really cool huge square hole above the engine, I
guess so they could get at the engine from above.  I have found the
panels to replace this hole, but on my '65 there is a 11&quot; or 12&quot; inch
round hole above the engine.  Should this hole also be in an early '59
or should the panel be solid.

Thanks,
Aaron
