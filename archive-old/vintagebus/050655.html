Subject: Re: [VB] Cleaning Gas tank -- Help


&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; I have a 63 SC with a tank full of very old gas.  It looks like the
&gt;&gt; varnish/sludge is pretty thick (1/8-1/4 inch on bottom).
&gt;&gt; What can I do to dissolve this stuff and reuse the tank?
&gt; 
&gt; The &quot;classic&quot; way to clean out a rusty fuel tank is to throw a couple
&gt; of handfuls of clean gravel or some nuts+bolts in it and shake the
&gt; tank around to break up the rust and junk.  Make sure you get all the
&gt; rocks/hardware out before putting the tank back in service.

I tried this method before and it just made things worse for me, as instead
of big chunks of crud I started to get really fine rust powder in the gas,
which was clogging filters at an alarming rate.  After several months and
about 50 fuel filters, I finally pulled it out again and sealed it with a
can of fiberglass resin from Kanadian Tire.  So far, so good.
