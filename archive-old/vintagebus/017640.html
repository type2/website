Well, you need sit down and decide a few things:

* how much can I spend
* what am I trying to accomplish?  Daily driver?  Trailer queen?  Daily queen?
* what do I intend to do with the car when it's done (sell/keep)
* how involved do I want to be in the process
* am I capable/do I want to do any of the work myself (dirty fingernails vs empty checkbook)
