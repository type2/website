 Your 60 SC would have come with 15&quot; rims.  These bus rimes are wider than the 15&quot;bug rims- the bus rims have 4 large gaps in them, though both have the same bolt pattern (for early bugs at least)


Re the wiper switch- did you get one with screw terminals?  61 was the first year for the push on wire terminals.   If you are having electrical problems do check your fuses and also cleaning connections especially ground with sandpaper works wonders.


I would recommend acquiring th eBentley reprint of the Transporter Workshop Manual edition 1963, excellent book, more technical that the idiot book, much more info- slightly later than yours but the best available unless you can find an original 1959 edition

&gt; Hello everyone,
&gt; 
&gt; I have been lurking for several months.  Purchased a 1960 single cab in
&gt; early Jan 00 _at_ Pomona--very pleased, drive to work daily.  Finally got my VW
&gt; idiot book by John Muir.  I cannot find w/in the book or the archives what
&gt; is the correct wheel size.  I have 14 inch tires on and am assuming that the
&gt; wheels are too.  They look too small for a pickup.
&gt; 
&gt; Wet Sunday at Pomona, but found a wiper switch (appropriate for such a day)
