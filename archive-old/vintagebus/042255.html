&gt; Thanks for the thought. I had not thought about the potentially corrosive

&gt; BTW the rubber string thingy is what most shops do for repair and that you 
&gt; can do yourself.

If I take a tire to a shop for repair I insist that they fix it properly
with a patch inside the tire.  The problem with plug repairs is that they
can work themselves out as the tire wears, a problem that I don't want to
deal with.  I would look with a jaundiced eye at any shop that uses plugs
to repair tires.  Any other work they do is likely to be equal in quality.
