Subject: Re: [VB] Re:Re: [VB] Westy Paint-Sikkens or Special Kolor

There has to be someone who knows. Too bad there isn't
anyone that worked at the factory that is a split bus
enthusiast today. Then maybe all of the questions
could be answered. Say a 18 year old guy got a job at
the factory in 59, that would only make him 61 years
old. Too bad someone's grandpa from Bulli Kartei
coulnd't unlock these mysteries.

&gt; Hey, come on, there are normally oodles of threads
&gt; that are far more redundant and boring than this
&gt; one.  Your point is well taken, so don't think I'm
&gt; in anyway taking offense to it, but I still feel the
&gt; urge to respond to it.  I'm halfway through a double
&gt; espresso and it's Friday.
&gt; 
&gt; I agree with you and Michael Heron about the poor
&gt; German language thing.  That's why my orignal post
&gt; indicated that I came to the conclusion during the
&gt; resto of my '59 that it stood for Sikkens.  But
&gt; Hazetguy Jon Furst got me thinking on it again. 
&gt; There has to be some reason for using the
&gt; abreviation.  I'm not losing sleep over it, but it
&gt; is *interesting* (to some of us anyway).
&gt; 
&gt; Bottom line is all of this &quot;meaningless dribble&quot;
&gt; that we consume ourselves with each and everyday
&gt; about pressed bumpers, middle seats,spalsh pans,
&gt; etc. really has very little bearing on World issues
&gt; or how the planet spins.  A lot of it doesn't even
&gt; have any bearing on the basic operation of one's
&gt; Bus.  But it's a hobby (or livelihood) that we
&gt; participate in and enjoy, so why not get caught up
&gt; in the minutia from time to time.  If someone wants
&gt; to spaz out about using original hardware (sorry
&gt; David, but I owe you a couple) the he or she should
&gt; knock themselves out.
