Nuts? Wha? are *you* crazy?

I drive 25+ miles one way to work every day into the
direction of the sun in my '63 EZ camper. Literally
always have pistol shooter's earplugs to deaden the
sound. Every Summer there is a phase in which I end up
driving with the windows SHUT because it's actually
cooler than having them open. That phase is about now.
Paula and the baby drive the 67 Westy. Everyone thinks
the baby has natually red cheeks after a one mile
drive. Paula just forced me over threat of endless
hormones to sell the '68 Buick Sportwagon stationwagon
with AC/PS/PB/PW/Auto etc etc etc because it was
&quot;ugly&quot;. I bought it because it had A/C and enough
power to get out of its own way. She hated the GM A
body shape and prefered the &quot;superior&quot; styling of the
splittie bus. (I figured that the lack of judgement
was attributed to the heat.) Cant really say that she
has her sense of taste in her mouth because she chose
me. Then again,  I sorta look like a TypeII... hmmm...
&quot;Liquid cooled&quot; is about like how Kyle describes it.
60 oz Thirst Busters while driving and other flavors
when not.
Where else besides Arizona (AriDzona)will club members
all converge on the raffle bus for a wrench-a-thon in
mid-August? Full sun crawling around in the dirt and
wrenching on a raffle bus all weekend long August
11,12,13. Us, Pussies? naw, Kyle has the beer and
blind, toothless dogs for entertainment. =)
