&gt; Because you're cheep like the rest of us?  What are NOS 930 and Testarossa parts going for now days?

Considering that I just bumped into a fellow who was very happy to get an
NOS ashtray clock for his bug for a little over $2000 (gad!) even
VW stuff
isn't inexpensive these days!

Anyway, the last time I took a Testarossa camping it was terribly
uncomfortable to sleep in and got all scratched up on the forest trail
into the campsite.
