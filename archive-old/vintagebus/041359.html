Hey Now!

  I've been kind of slackin' in getting around to things with my bus.
It's been sitting for a while and askin' for help.  Ronnie came through
big time with a large order of sheet metal(yea!) and I'm planning on
getting that stuff put into place soon.  Once I'm done there I can get
some paint on it and finally take it out into the rain.  Hopefully just
in time for the Seattle meet. Anyway, in the lingering saga of my tranny
swap I've been trying to get off my big nut axles from my tranny.  If you
remember, I tried to use a huge air impact to get them off and nada.  So I
took everyones advice and cut the nuts to weaken them and hopefully pry
them off.  Last night I finally got around to actually cutting it last 
night!(I'd been restoring a '55 schwinn bike in the meantime).  
So I made my cut and so far so good.  They should come off tonight once I
get more tools.   But my brother says that you can remove the axle
tubes(redux and all) without tapin' into the breaks. I
told him he was full of it(he's a bug guy himself). So, can you do this?
If so how?
