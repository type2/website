The stereotypical bad-distributor problem: starts ok, idles well, but
during acceleration it has no power and at least one cylinder has
trouble firing.  Very much what I think of as a distributor that
doesn't advance properly.

It ran fine before the carb swap.  Well, actually, I'd sometimes get
similar symptoms when driving at night, after running at highway speeds
for a while.  I'd been attributing it to having the lights on and them
pulling too much power due to dirty contacts and such (you can hear
the engine slow down a bit when the lights get turned on).  But, I
wasn't using lights during yesterday's mid-day driving test.

My carb-adjusting abilities are legendary - I can make any carb
non-functional.  Thus, I'm reluctant to fiddle with it unless there's
a good chance that that's the problem.
