Ditto what Clara said, but just saw that Harbor Freight has a propane attach heater on sale for $29.95. It didn't have much of a reflector, so shop around. Maybe fabricate one from aluminum flashing?

Another source of heat/light are Coleman lanterns. Gas or propane, they don't care if your camping or wrenching. The bomb is a kerosene shop heater, looks like your mom's canister vacuum on galactic steroids. Billions and billions of btu's. All this stuff is Open Flame, so keep a extiguisher handy and plug those fuel lines. 

Pulled the engine out of the non-stock '63 Doublecab tonight. Massive blow by was the reason. Found a black patch about 2&quot; square at the upper stroke of #4. Feels a bit rough. Is this a faulty jug? Rings look good, move freely, not broken. What to do?

Sorry, Kyle. Didn't follow your directions to the letter, will save the heavy drinking for BBB. I'll pitch in for half your keg this year.  

Ronnie, are those 3 brew pubs bicycle close? I can see Mudshark on Streets 2000, seems to be the closest.
