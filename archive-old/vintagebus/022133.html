Some people asked for OCTO show pictures and I finally got a couple of 
rolls of film from my trip developed.

There are 4 photos shot from Charlie's ladder truck I pasted together at 

http://www.mindspring_dot_com/~deasterw/octo/octo.htm

but they do not begin to show how successful the show was.  I wish I had 
gotten more photos, but I was busy manning the NEATO Registration booth 
for about half the day.  I'll definitely be going back next year!

Dave
