Well, there's good news and bad news.

Good news is, I got the motor together and in the bus and it runs.

Bad news is, oil is POURING out from between the cylinders and the block, mainly
on the left but some on the right too.  Some is also coming out some of the
pushrod tubes.

What did I do wrong?  How do I fix it?

TIA,
Diana
