Subject: RE: [VB] N.A.D.A.

&gt;Holy Moses!!!! If I could count the total High retail
&gt;NADA prices for my 3 busses, that would up my net
&gt;worth $40,550.00. Wonder if I could use these for a
&gt;loan?????????????? ;&gt;)
&gt;
I think you could if you get legitimate appraisals for those values.  Of
course, then if you ever miss a payment or 2, they repro your Buses, dang=
.

I personally prefer to get a 2nd/3rd/4th against my house because that's
what the tv commercials tell me to do.  Did you know I can eliminate $500=
-$1000/month
in high credit card and auto loan payments?!?  Call now, don't delay, lim=
ited
time offer, the first 10 callers get 1% off our already low rate of 21.95=
%!
