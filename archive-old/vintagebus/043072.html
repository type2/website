Normally I try to have outdoor projects completed by this time of
year...but I ended up last night stringing tarps over/around the Westy and
performing a front brake job and some sheet metal repairs while snowflakes
were falling ever so slightly around my little camp enclosure.  Had it not
been for the 3-500 watt halogen light fixtures I had strategically placed
nearby, I think I would have just said to hell with it!
So what do ya think about that NQ!  And I've got about another 6 or 7 days
work do do out there yet.
I'm thinking about cutting up my electric blanket and sewing it into a
body suit I can wear...then running an extension cord to it and cranking
it up to 10!  Maybe I won't mind the working conditions that way.
Work ten minutes...warm up the hands for 5.  Almost getting work done now.
later
