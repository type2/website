Subject: Electric powered bus ?
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

My friend wants to make his single cab battery powered .....

20-30 miles range would be OK

anyone know a website that he can go to for electric car info?

He plans on putting the batteries  in the storage bay......

anyone know where a motor and adapter are laying around ?

years ago Bradley was building electric powered Bradley GTs, they had some 
Government money to build electric cars
VW chassis, surplus electric  motor (I think aircraft starter motor) and lots 
of batteries.....

When they went Bankrupt there was tons of this stuff at their auction.......
