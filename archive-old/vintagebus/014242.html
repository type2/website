Kinda like the Kustom folks: just because you laid of $25k for paint and
body work on your super beetle doesn't make it a $25k car!

Some times you either have to live with your expense-mobile (like me &amp;
my 911 which I have WAY too much into) or suck up, take the loss, and sell
it.

Maybe he could put it on ebay, and make $16k on it!
