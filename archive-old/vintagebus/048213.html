Actually, I have a funny story.
At the OCTO meet my friend Hugo recognized him as Eddie Van Halen and walked 
up to him, BEGGED for his autograph.
Eddie said &quot;If I give you my autograph, then I have to give EVERYONE here my 
autograph&quot;.
Hugo continued to beg and he said &quot;Come on man...I've listened to you since I 
was 8 years old!&quot;
Eddie said alright and breaks out a pen.
Eddie hands the autograph to hugo and he looks at it.
Hugo says &quot;Awwww s*^t, I thought you were slash!&quot; and turns around and walks 
away.

Yep, he knew who it was.....just having fun with the celebrity.
