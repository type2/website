I took 4 pictures of my bus today with a load of lumber in the rack.  I went
to upload them and ran out of space so would someone be able to have me
email these 4 pix (about 80k each) and then make a link available for a
couple days for everyone to see?  You can delete them after a couple days.

Thanks!
