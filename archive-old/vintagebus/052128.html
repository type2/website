Subject: Tucson Trip

I will be going to Tucson the first week in Feb.. I will be looking for a
single/double cab, circa 68-71.  Anyone know of anything? Also, would like
to get together with any Listees who might want to share a brew or whatever.
Any shows or events? TBear

Don't take life to seriously- you'll never live through it..
