Subject: belated thank you Modestees

Just realized this was lurking in my out box...
I would like to thank all the Modesto-area Listees who responded to my
posts a few weeks ago; and especially to CR Sauls, who was the actual
bag-man for my favor.

Since  Vintagebus[VB] is turning into Whinybus[WB] lately, I thought I'd
make a BRIEF, NON hysterical/namecalling post about what my favor was. All
of you interested in bitchslapping fights can tune out now.

A guy on ebay bought an item from me - didn't make my minimum, but I sold
it anyway. Two weeks later, I pmailed him to see how it was going; I got a
message stating 'item is junk, check was cancelled earlier this week.' Now,
the item was NOT junk, and I have 2 mechanics here that say so, but one
man's junk... so that was ok, I honor a no-questions-asked return policy.
CANCELLING the check without telling me was NOT ok, and immediately calls
to mind scamartistry (BTW, did you know that a check can be cancelled up to
SIX MONTHS after it has cleared your bank? That money is simply removed
from your account without ceremony). That, and then the person refused to
send the item back without ME paying the shipping;  I had paid the shipping
TO him  :P
Jerk.

So Craig volunteered to go get the item from a stranger and send it back to
me - THANK YOU.

My cost - $40+ in shipping, and $5 in returned-item fee, and a little less
trust in people (and banks!).
I was not under ANY illusion that &quot;VWpeople&quot; or &quot;Buspeople&quot; are somehow
nobler than others, so I am bemused by all the wounded howling about
betrayal on the List along those lines; some people suck, no matter what
their hobby.

Calling folks names on this List isn't gonna get your sh*t back, and makes
those of us who read this List FOR INFORMATION a little tired. And yes,
knowing that one might be careful about dealing with certain people is
information, but lately things have been gettin' outta
hand.....................
