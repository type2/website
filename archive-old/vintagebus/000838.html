Still don't have Sunshine's reduction box fixed, but now I have another
problem.  Before I started taking her apart, I ran a compression check on
the AVP rebuild in Sunshine that has about 8,000 miles on it, and found the
right bank at about 110, but the left bank was about 90 on 4 and 10 on 3
(d*mn!).  When I cranked the engine over by hand, I could feel it tighten up
on the compression stroke on all but 3, where I could hear a hissing noise
from under the tin (sh*t!).  Well, today I took the left head off and the
front nut under the rocker was only about finger tight, and the other three
nut were sequentially tighter towards the rear.

When I got the head off, it was clear that both 3 &amp; 4 had been blowing past
the head to cylinder mating.  There is no oil leakage from the cylinder to
case mating and there is no evidence of blow-by on the right bank (as
indicated by discoloration of the pushrod tubes under the head mating face).
The mating surface on the head is still shiny and doesn't look damaged by
the blow-by.

I plan on calling AVP on Monday, since this engine is still under warrantee,
but I am inclined to re-assemble the whole thing, and if the compression
checks alright, I'll re-check the torque in 500 miles and probably let AVP
off the hook if everything looks healthy.  If health doesn't return with
re-assembly, that's another matter.

My appeal to the list wisdom is whether this seems wise, or should I take
the head in for inspection first?

Thanks in advance,
terry &amp; Sunshine ('64 Westy)
