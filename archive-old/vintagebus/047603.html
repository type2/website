Subject: rpms in gears- two trannys, why I don't like math
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

 rpms for my 61                                   65
 
                 mph                               mph
 rpm   1st   2nd  3rd  4th          1st  2nd  3rd  4th 
 
 1500            8                            
 2000          13   23   38                  16    27    40
 2500          16   30   47                                 49
 3000   9     20   37   58            12   22    38    58
 extrapolate to
 3500                       68                                 67  
 
 the 65 wears 14&quot; rims with 25.5&quot; dia tires measured horizontally (all 4 same)
 tranny big nut (1.26 redux) with 3.88 tranny
 
 the 61 wearing 15&quot; rims with 26&quot; dia tires (all 4 same)
 tranny big nut (1.26 redux) with what when I took the side cover off was a 
4.37 r&amp;p
 
 
 these were both measured with the same tach,
 
 am told the speedo in my 61 is a little slow- that 58 on the speedo is 62 
real speed
 
 not sure how exact the 65's is, but not wildly off.
 
 comments?
