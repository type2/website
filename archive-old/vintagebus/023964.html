Personally, I'd use the non-synthetic only if I was using an upright
engine with a sand-seal on it... and I would start just after the
break-in period.
	The big thing about the synthetics is that they will last longer than
the non-synthetics, purity, reduction of wear (?)...
	I think they would be great in a new type IV engine... because the
engine is sealed at both ends of the crank. The uprights don't have that
seal, and suck dirty air in around the crank pulley, necessitating
frequent oil changes anyway and making the use of synth over non-synth
non-viable. Best combination is a sand seal and a &quot;true&quot; full flow oil
filtering system, if you go with the synthetic oil, or anyways.
	All this, of course, was what I gleaned from the Sermons of Bob Hoover,
especially the sand seal idea. Just citing what made me think about
that...
	But... sand seal, full-flow... and synthetic if you want it, would be
the best, IMHO.
