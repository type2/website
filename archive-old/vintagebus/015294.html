Subject: fuel tap Q's

Oops,

After a bit more rummaging around WW's site, I found the bus fuel tap that 
hopefully will work:

http://www.wolfsburgwest_dot_com/cgi-bin/wwshowpn.cgi?PN=211209021E

This matches the correct PN.  My original question remains, will this fit on 
a baywindow tank?  I will need to re-fab the fuel tap lever, can anyone send 
me some dimensions?

Thanks, sorry for the rambling previous post.
