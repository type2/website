David,

I have seen these conversions installed in a few different  makes of
vans.  There is a 60's Corvair in a junk yard in So Cal that has one of
these.  I didn't see a maker tag.

There was a camper converter over in England that used these types of
tops.  They were called Slumberwagens and were manufactured by European
Cars of South Kensington, London.  The english refer to this type of roof
as a &quot;Calthorpe elevated domed roof&quot;.

There are pictures and a small amount of information in a book titled&quot;VW
Bus  *Camper*Bus*Van*Pick-up*Wagon&quot; by Malcolm Bobbit.  It is published
by Veloce Publishing PLC.  And I quote

&quot;the Slumberwagen, a conversion based on the early split-window
Transporter.   Available with a Calthorpe roof which, in the raised
position, was dome-shaped and incorporated sliding windows, the
Slumberwagen provided sleeping acomodation for a maximum of two adults
and two children.  Extending the roof was a fairly simple task and, in
terms of reliability - it was completely water and draughtproof, it was
one of the best of its type when tested by the Autocar  staff.&quot;

There are two pictures of this conversion on page 88 of that book.

Hope this helps.  Sounds interesting, to bad the interior is not there!
Good luck.

&gt;   Hello All. I have a question on a bus that we found here that no
&gt; local VW places can identify. Its a '62 or '63, non-walkthru(I really
&gt; dont know how to tell the difference between models) The interior has
&gt; been completely gutted except for front seat. The unique thing about
&gt; the bus is the &quot;pop top&quot; that it has on it.
&gt; Going to try to give a good description... imagine someone cutting the
&gt; top off of a bus 4 or 5 inches from the drip rail, all the way around.
&gt; Then a giant rectangle baking pan,upside down, 5 or 6 inches deep,
&gt; slapped on top. Then a rectangle hole cut in the baking pan, 4 or 5
&gt; inches from the outside of the pan. Lost ya yet? Heres the getter, in
&gt; this hole in the pan, running on the sides, is two flip up half moon
&gt; shaped things. Ya flip these up to make the sides of the pop
&gt; top.(these have small windows in em) Then for the &quot;ceiling&quot; is these
&gt; aluminum slates that are retractable &amp; pull back, connecting to the
&gt; sides to create this weird &quot;pop top&quot;:) On the pass side, in the back,
&gt; on the &quot;baking pan&quot; is thas rather large tag that reads
&gt; &quot;Travel Equipment Corp, New York, NY, USA&quot;. The intire structure is
&gt; made of aluminum.
&gt;   The reason I need to find out about it is that it would really be
&gt; easy for me to aquire(I have some VW toys he wants real bad:) But need
&gt; to know more info, especially on the interior.
&gt;   If you think this wouldnt be of interest to the list, please pmail
&gt; me if ya have any info.
&gt;
&gt; Thanks
