i know this is about the engine in my bug, but, it applies to bus engines as 
well (sorry everybody but i need help:( )

While driving home from the NIVA show in Villa Park, IL. last weekend, my 
clutch started to act up. It was slipping terribly. I figured, no big deal 
ill take the drive back to peoria taking it  easy while Neil followed me in 
his 71' panel. We pull over again on 355 and oil is just pouring out of my 
sump.Dooh!!!!!!! My Buddies Neil and Jason (jasons engine in his bus locked 
up 10 miles previously and had to get towed to a friends house)  gave it a 
look and knew that my main engine seal was bad and leaking onto my clutch!!! 
Ended up stopping every 40 miles to add oil. Made it home barely.
Start it up yesterday and there is a loud knocking (uh oh). Take it in to my 
trusty VW mechanic and find out today my case is shot. The pulley has about 
an inch of play against the case(front to back).

To make a long thread short-------Who is the most reputable company to buy a 
longblock 1600 dp from. Im thinking of GEX at the moment. Definately not 
MOFOCO.

Sorry for the bug content , It can apply to a bus -  -
