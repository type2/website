&gt; Lets just clarify a few things.
&gt; Forget the expensive billet cranks from Scat and Bugpack (note: billet, not

Note that billet cranks are probably worse than cast cranks.  They are
machined from a cast &quot;blob&quot; (billet) of metal, which means that you have a
casting _with_ machined stress risers interrupting what little grain the
casting has!  You're better off with a casting that at least approximates
the shape of the crank to start with!

Billet machining is the quickest way to get a one-off part.  They aren't
stronger or better than a casting except that they look kewl.

Metallurgy has come a long way.  Castings are now doing the job where
forging was once required.  Unless you're building a race engine I
wouldn't worry about using a cast crank.
