----- Original Message -----
&gt; you are in FAR more danger from under-inflation than over-inflation.
&gt; overinflated tires give you a harsher ride and will 'let go' in hard

Know about Corvairs flipping like flapjacks at low speed if the tires were
set too high of pressure? It was a serious problem. How about swingaxle VW's
tucking in a tire and flipping over at speeds as slow as 30mph with too high
of tire pressure getting on the freeway onramp? Overinflation is most
definitly dangerous.

You can blame Ford if you want, but I have a question: The source  you state
says the tires were underinflated, were they assuming the tires on the
Explorers that flipped were running 26psi, or lower? Did they actually
determine what the tire pressure was in the tires that failed, or only
assumed Explorer owners were filling thier tires to manufacturer specs?
Unless we KNOW this part, we cannot know the rest of the details.

You called me &quot;WRONG&quot; in capital letters. Re-read what I wrote. I simply
asked if it was a coincedence, I never stated anything about the cause of
the tire failure. Cool, huh?
