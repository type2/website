Subject: WANTED: Front Windsheilds(non-cracked)
Message-ID: &lt;Pine.A41.4.10.10001280743510.78212-100000_at_dante03.u.washington_dot_edu&gt;

Greetings,

   A friend of mine wanted to get a pair of front windshields because his
Izzi Safari's are not holding up in the cold and rainy seattle weather.  
Do you have a set of windshield that he could buy or do you know of a
company(other then BFY who he won't do biz with) that does sell the
screens?  He'd like the logo'ed glass but if you've got a repo that would
do. Cash is waiting!  In Seattle area is great but if you've got something
and are out of state but willing to ship then
contact me and I'll let him know so you guys can strike up a deal. 

Also, Does anyone know how to remove the Emergancy flashers light on the
63-65 dashboard? It's commonly refered to here as the &quot;BRL&quot;=big red light.
Any help would be great!
