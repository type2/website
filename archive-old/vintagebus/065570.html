Subject: Thanks for all the turn signal info/update

I was looking through the box-o-parts the PO gave me and in there was an
old turn signal switch and a 9-prong box, I metered the switch and after
soldering one of the dimmer relay wires back on, it seemed to be working
fine.  The box's ground wire broke off so I soldered that back together
as well.  The wiring looked like hell behind the kickpanel of the bus,
like a cross between egg-drop soup and a robin's nest.  However, to make
a long story short I now have a functioning turn signal switch, hazards,
dome light and high/low dimmer.  I love my bus.  I do have to go back in
and check the connection on the high/low dimmer it will change states
sometimes when the steering wheel is being turned.  I did have one
problem with the pins 54 and 54f on the 9-prong box dubbed &quot;blinkgeber&quot;
My brake lights would not come on, it seems 54 brings in the signal from
the brake switch and then travels out on 54f up to the turn signal, so I
disconnected 54 from the box and spliced directly onto 54f so that way
my hazards would still work (the hazard signal is generated inside the
box).  Should I be worried about jumping that connection, does anyone
know the inner schematic of the &quot;blinkgeber&quot; for now all is well with
the lights and I feel much safer.
  My new problem, it's always something isn't it?, is that now I have a
whine coming from around the transmission except when the clutch is
fully depressed.  I have ordered a throw out bearing from the local
import place.  I also ordered an engine gasket set as mine is leaking
oil and I want to make it stop.  Where should I look for the leaks at?
what is the most prone to leak?  I have a 1776 in my bus and I was told
that it is just a 1600 with a bigger set of cylinders on it.  Is that
true?  I also have a hole in my muffler (which is an aftermarket) and I
was thinking of switching out to a stock exhaust setup like the one in
the busdepot catalog, would this setup work with my engine? will it
affect performance?
  I am also glad to report that my bus has a new vinyl skin on top which
looks alot better than the stiff, torn, discolored vinyl I had up there
before.  I highly recommend changing tops because it was an easy job and
I did it myself in about 2 hours (this includes trips to the store to
buy the little 4mmX7mm screws that go through the top and hold it to the
bows (mine were missing).
   Anyway, I thought you would all appreciate the update,
