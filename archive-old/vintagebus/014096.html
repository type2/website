&gt; i'm sorry if this sounds a little dumb ass of me but as i can only just 
&gt; drive and have only been seriously interested in vw buses for about a year 
&gt; could you take a minute of your time to explain and give dates to all of the 
&gt; vw camper types?  i've heard of different models such as westfalias and 
&gt; barndoors but have limited knowledge of them and the other versions. a 
&gt; complete guide of all busses would be greatly apprecciated .  cheers in 
&gt; advance
