Subject: Re: [VB] Paint - Mango Green / Seagull Grey

You need to ask the people that will sell you the Valu-Pro paint these questions.

****************************************************************************************************

My question - So whats the scoop on Valu-Pro?  I have some CIL acrylic enamel primer surfacer that I
plan on using.  I had that around for a while but I don't have the reducer for it.  Should my
valu-pro reducer work for that CIL stuff as well - both are acrylic enamel. The valu-pro paint is
ICI or PPG?  This stuff is Acrylic Enamel and I hear that is a very good choice for someone who has
never painted before.
