The Extrude-Hone process uses something similar to silly putty, with
an abrasive mixed in, working it back and forth under pressure to
&quot;port&quot; the heads/manifolds/etc.  It would take an awful big machine
to do a bus!   Plus, due to the nature of the process..., well, it's
just not suited to rust removal...

&gt; Anybody see the Hot-VW-Trends (can't remember, or distinguish between the rags) article on pushing abrasive foam through heads to port &amp; polish them? How about pushing some of that stuff through rockers, or through the whole damn rusty bus?
