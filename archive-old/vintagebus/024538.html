Subject: RE: Dual Carbs/Stock Exhaust

Ev &amp; List, 
I can't answer the specific question, but I did have a couple of
comments. I'm not suggesting pulling the dual carbs, but there is no
reason you should have icing of the stock carb if everything is set up
correctly. The stock muffler will be properly set up for the heat riser
(most extractors are NOT, see archives). If the heat riser is clean,
that will address part of the problem.

You should also be using the stock air cleaner and have the pre-heat
tube connected. Put that tube back in the engine tin that draws hot air
off the 1&amp;2 cylinder head.

I've always had good results with stock carbs with this configuration,
30pict and 34pict mostly. Never running a 1776, though, but I don't
think this is the problem.

On the extractor/heat thing... is there a market for a *decent*
extractor? I used to have a kick-ass extractor (actually, still have it,
but needs muffler) that I've posted about before. It has cast fittings
where all the tubes join and the flanges for the heads. It also has the
little canisters crimped on the #2 &amp; #4 pipes that pre-heat the air
before hitting the heat exchangers. AND it has a tube for the carb heat
riser coming from the collector, so the heat riser works properly with
the extractor.

Are there enough warm blooded, cold climate individuals out there to
justify production of something like this? The current EMPI and BUG CRAP
extractors systems are SH*T! They are cheap to manufacture, though, and
the VW population seems comfortable with them... or maybe the masses
don't know that it could be better.

Sorry if this turned into a bit of a rant. I am curious if a decent
extractor would sell; probably twice the price of the current crap
(p-mail, unless the comments benefit the list).

Happy Thanksgiving,
pd

&gt; Anyone out there running kadrons, 1776 and a stock exhaust? I'm
&gt; considering pulling off my extractor so I can get a little more heat
&gt; with the stock muffler. I know it will be restrictive, but will it
&gt; overheat the engine? I have stock valves and a stock cam, so it
&gt; shouldn't be much of a problem. I could put my 30 pict -1 back on, but
&gt; it ices up when its chilly out and the duals do not ice up.
