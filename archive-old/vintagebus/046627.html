 This gels with my experience. My '60 Dcab built on the 18 December '59 has
 the tunnel box. While I would like to have had a 1950's bus I must say that
 a split box sounds like a parts and repair nightmare just waiting to happen.
 Befopre I get my ass flamed off please bear in mind that I drive my bus
 daily and I live in Deepest Darkest Africa where practitioners of the gentle
 art of split box repair are extremely thin on the ground.

 I daily drove my 59 w/split case trans for 3 years.  When I got it (my first 
splitty) it had bad boots and no gear oil.  I found this out after I had 
driven 300 miles and it started making a whiney noise.  I replaced the boots 
and filled it with oil, but damage had already been done, and the tranny 
crashed and burned a few years later.   It was making the most horrendous 
noise, and I called around for trany rebuild info.   At that time (about ten 
years ago) this was available for the sum of $750 for a splitcase tranny, but 
I was horrified, that was more than the bus cost!!!!!  found a 58 parts bus 
with a good splitcase and swapped it, but on the final drive home my old 
tranny croaked (shreek tear crunch no forward motion) and I had to be towed.  
 Wished I had taken more parts off the parts bus, it had  a good front bumper 
and doors and hard to find brake cables and shifter parts and all its inside 
panels (standard micro) and think it was a walk through etc, but it had 
flipped on its side and the bus was slightly twisted.  A friend got the 
windsheilds and big spoon latches So yes the rebuild price can be 
intimidating, but if you just keep oil in them they last a long time.
