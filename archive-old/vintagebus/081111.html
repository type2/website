Subject: RE: [VB] [F] any UK listees want to get me some beer?

Ah, but you see, when you put a bus on a boat, they don't like to see
anything out in the open so it all has to be concealed, or at least that
is what I was told.  Ultimately, I bought my firebus when I did because
I was running out of trappist.  I figured I could get a BUNCH of beer in
it.  And then I was told I couldn't put anything in it.  Bummer.

Now the funny thing is, when I got the tipper, I found 12 or so 14&quot; bus
rims in the back, all just laying there in the bed.  If you look at any
of the old pictures of it at BBTs, you can see the rims.  A year goes by
after I bought it and Bob emails me one day and asks if all those rims
were in the tipper to which I replied 'yes'... &quot;that's where they all
went&quot; he said!  Seems one of his minions didn't take them out before
they shipped it off!  Nowadays, if someone is need of a specific date
code 14&quot; bus rim, they get it for free!  Compliments of me and Bob.
