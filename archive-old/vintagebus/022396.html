Subject: Sat. Junk hunting
Mime-Version: 1.0

Well, every month and 1/2 or 2 months we take Sat. morning and go junk
hunting. I usually score some old VW toys and stuff like that. Today I
found one of those &quot;barefoot/footprint&quot; gas pedals. I had wanted one of
these for the '59 Kombi, and was glad to get one for $1.50!

Also found an old plastic bug from the 60's for $1.00 and a Matchbox Coke
new beetle convertible. Nothing great, but still fun.

One cool thing I found, but didn't buy, was a working auto siren &amp; light
from an old police car or some other emergency vehicle. It was from around
1955. I thought it'd be cool to get for some future project. It's american,
but it's still a period piece. Would look great on a VW firebus or a Police
panelbus!! What do ya think?!?!?!!

Lots of Saturday morning fun!!!!
