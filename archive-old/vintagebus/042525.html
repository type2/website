I'm just guessing as instead of having the wipers all nicely laid in the
one eyed duck with the safaris open, theay are pointing out at the sky,
and no one eyed duck is to be found.

The shots are all taken on a beach, it looks posed and shiny like he
wanted to put the busses best foot forward... i think if he had
disconnects, he would have done that rather than sticking em out like
jousting spears...

So, im guessing, but i think its a good guess...

take care,

Steve
