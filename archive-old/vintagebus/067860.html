Subject: octo

Hi All,

I'll be making it down to the octo show this weekend... woohoo!
Accordingly, if you have any gas tank divider felts and/or burlap heater
duct fabric that's taking valuable space up in your garage or storage shed,
bring it along and we can strike a deal. :-)

Look for me as I'll be hopefully wearing my white 67 tipper shirt and
rummaging through the swaps looking for small bits.


see ya there.

David
