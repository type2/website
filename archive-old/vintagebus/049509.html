Subject: wiring looms and sumthin GOOD in a VW rag...

As I anticipate a new nose skin to arrive sometime in the next month or two
(not a hint to the sender, btw... I am in no hurry. Just don't forget me!),
I decided to replace the wires while I had the cheesgrater nose off.

I am looking for opinions as to who is a good MANUFACTURER of looms for my
65 S/C... I will then grill our fine List-approved vendors as to price :)

Also, the Feb VW Trends has a profusely illustro'd article on just this
procedure, which I take as a sign the VW gods approve of my actions. Sadly,
it had few words to accompany said photos - anyone who has done this care
to post their tips?
