&gt; fired her up.  It runs a little noisier with the chromoly pushrods (Which
I
&gt; gapped at .004 across the board) as well.

You should run your chromoly pushrods considerably tighter. I run a 'loose'
zero on mine. Meaning that I can spin them freely with my fingers, but there
is no gap. For your trip you might let them out a tad in case the valves
seat in a little, but tight is right on them. Just check them more often.
Obviously if you hear the tell-tale popping of a tight valve, you may have
to adjust them out for your particular engine, but I've never had to.
Running them that loose will cause a lot of clacking and wear and a loss in
power, but no benefit. For a little more power, you should lose the double
valve springs. Under 6000 rpm's you don't need them and they flatten your
cam faster.
