&gt; There are some washers that have worn out.  A couple of fiber washers around 
&gt; the shaft, just below and above the distributor body (you have to 
&gt; disassemble the distributor to get to them).  These have disintegrated and 
&gt; the metal washers are pretty worn, too. 

Hi Mark,
The fiber washers are made out of phenolic materal.  The metal washers should 
be steel (You can check with a magnet.).  We have heard of rebuild kits for 
009 distributors (Mayhaps Ronnine has a handle on those!).
