&gt;
&gt; CREW CAB TILT 100% complete:
&gt; bows,wood,canvas.
&gt; slightly lower than cab height, very sturdy after market,
&gt; looks very similar to original. Natural canvas, correct grommets.
&gt; Can be shipped UPS
&gt; $650 for all, slightly used

I just wanted to say that I saw this canopy on Rexs truck at the show in
Vallejo and it is very nice indeed.
