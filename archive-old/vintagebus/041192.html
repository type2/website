Happy British Empire Fragmentation Day Everybody -
(Let's make it International.)
Would someone with a pulled engine or engine case sitting around handy
be so kind as to stick a piece of wire or something in the tapped hole
in the case for the thermostat bracket and tell me how deep it is? I
have to drill and tap said hole in my new Brazil (I guess they don't
use thermostats there) case and I don't want disastrous results.
Thanks,
Joel
Ps. Free Stuff: driver's seat (and back) from 60's bench seat bus.
Pick it up or pay for shipping from zip95639. Also pre-doghouse engine
tin.
