Subject: Re: [VB] Popular Mechanics VW feature?

Sorry this doesn't answer your question ... but ... I have an October 58
Science and Mechanics magazine (very similar to Popular Mechanics) that test
drives a 23 Window Microbus (of course that call it a Station Wagon-Bus.)
The test drive pages also include a mention of the V-1 Camper Unit, made by
Saxe and Co., 915 West Olive Ave., Burbank California.  The idea was to pull
out the middle seat and slide the V-1 camper unit in.  The unit had a
telescopic leg in each corner.  In the picture it shows the camper unit out
side the bus and about 2' off the ground.  The picture shows that the 'bed'
was actually a cot that extended between the back of the drivers bench seat
and rear seat.

Also  - the mag has a little article about the 'Volks-Zweisitzer)  the
&quot;People Two-Seater&quot;  it was supposed to cost $400.00.

I have another one from the same period that has instuctions on how to build
a volkswagen powered engine.

It's been my experience that places that sell early Popular Mechanics also
often have a few Science and Mechanics as well.
