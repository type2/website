Subject:  RE: [VB] amber brake light lens?

Could be the amber trafficator lense fitted
to 59, 60 and 61 Australian and Italian buses.

This lense filled the gap between the end of 
semaphores and the later combined red/amber lense
seen on the rar of all Euro buses.

I have a picture at www.splitbusaustralia_dot_com

go to the update pages (link at bottom of left frame)
and scroll down the right frame for a pic.  Is this it?  If so,
pretty rare find here (in a country where they
were used), let alone in the US!
