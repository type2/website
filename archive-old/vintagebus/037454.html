Thom(admin.) -please temporarily remove me from the list (Ill be back)
 
Hey everybody, Ive gotta get off of the list for five weeks. Ill be going to 
Boston on Fri. morning to grasp on a big opportunity. Ive been selected to 
study the guitar (ive been playin for six years) _at_ Berklee College of music 
in the city of Boston. I hate to leave, but come the middle of August, I'll 
be back and better than ever. Im a &quot;bus junkie&quot; who will be deprived of 
knowledge (aahh!!!!!).

I'll be back-pete
