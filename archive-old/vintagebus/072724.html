Be careful using the term '_____ value' - the terms
'stated value' and 'agreed value' and 'replacement value'
get bandied about quite a bit, but they mean very different
things.  I'm not current on what is what, so I'll shut
up now (that's rare!) so as not to spread disinformation.

I had a _____ value policy w/Hagerty for $12k

I went back to AAA because I wanted to actually drive the bus
and not have to worry about if I was out-of-bounds on the 
policy or not.  When I get the DC fully functional, I may
go back to Hagerty.
