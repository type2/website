Subject: Single port manifolds for 34 icts

Hopefully they aren't too tough to come by, but knowing my luck . . .
Well anyways, I am looking for single port manifolds for 34 icts. I am
also looking for air cleaners for these carbs and linkages. If you have
any of these items, or have leads on any of these items, please let me
know. Thanks.


Chris

PS They will be used on my 67 Camper (Bus content).
