Subject: RE: [VB] Dead mouse removal?

All this mouse stuff reminds me of when I was
following  my shop partner Barry across town after he
got a bus running that had been dead for a while. 
Apparently, his mouse had built a flammable nest, and
it smoldered all the way from his house to the shop. 
He had to look out the window to see where he was
going, and it didn't smell too good, but probably all
the bacteria burned up!
