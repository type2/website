I've seen this statement used quite a bit recently on Buses for sale.

It seems that would vary quite a bit from area to area.

I'm assuming it means &quot;No Rust&quot; since I live in AZ.  ;)  Of course, &quot;No
Rust&quot; has it's own meaning...

So are these the usual places:
Rockers
Front floors
Cargo floor
Belly pans (if installed)
Battery tray
Inside rear corners (truck only)
Lower nose
?
