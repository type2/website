Hi George,
We had a simular difficultly with a clutch throw out shaft and with the same
area of the throwout shaft as you did.  Turned out that one of the slots for
one of the C-clips had been machined with the bottom of the slot tapered
instead of parallel to the shaft.  With the side pressure and a little working
the clutch pedal back and forth the C-clip would be pushed up and open to
allow the shaft to move left.  Putting the throwout bearing out of center.  So
just goes to show you that all parts must be inspected carefully before
installation.  Eric &amp; Barb
