Hi List!
Tried a quick and easy replacement of the ground wire going through the
steering column to the horn. Crimped new wire to old and pulled. As you can
guess, the shorted part of the old wire snapped. _at_(#$(&amp;_at_#. I am using big 10
gauge wire so I don't need a coat hanger. It pushes right through and
doesn't bend! I try from the top and am unable to hit the lower hole. I try
from the bottom and my 8 year old helper says, &quot;parts are coming through.
Black stuff&quot; and I imagine some oil on the end of the wire. NOT! I get
inside to see her holding a metallic cylinder about the size of a mechanical
pencil eraser and a key (slot/keyway/key key) sticking out of the hole in
the steering column. What to do????? Specific advice would be real helpful
here, as I am short on time. I have about 2 hrs between now and High Country
Bus Meet to work on it.
