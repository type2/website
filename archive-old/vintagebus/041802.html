&gt; Hi List,
&gt; 
&gt; Is it necessary to leave the car overnight to set the valve timing? I've run
&gt; outa weekends before I leave on a trip and this is the last piece of
&gt; maintenance that I still have to do.
&gt; 
&gt; I'd like to do it tonight after letting the bus stand for about 4 hours or
&gt; until the sump is cold to the touch. Is this unwise?

Well, the whole point of letting the engine get cold is to get the whole
engine to the same temperature and to have that temperature in a range
where you can make meaningful measurements.  As long as you meet these
requirements, it doesn't matter how long the engine sits.

However, let's look at the effect of not letting the engine sit long
enough.  Just for arguement's sake, let's say that the pushrods are 10C
hotter than the cylinders, that is, 10C hotter than they should be.  The
coefficient of expansion for aluminum is .000072, which means that every
inch of the pushrod will get .000072 longer for every degree celsius it is
heated.  Not much, right?  

Well, we're talking 10C, so every inch of the
pushrod will expand .00072 inches.  the pushrods are about 10 inches
long, so each pushrod will expand .0072!  IF you adjust the valves to .006
in this condition and then let the engine cool, the clearance will be
.0132!

Frankly, the above numbers are a surprise to me, as I expected the
deviation to be a couple of thousanths.  Still, I can't find any error in
my math.

My scenario of a single part being hotter than the others is
oversimplified, but it isn't hard to see that a 10C temperature difference
could be easily attained between the various parts of the engine.

From the above, I would say that overnight cooling is an excellent idea,
and that anything less might be courting problems.  

You could test this
idea by letting the engine cool for four hours, setting the valves, then
letting it sit overnight and checking them again.  If I'm right, they will
all be loose.  If I'm full of it, let me know!
