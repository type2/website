Grew up in the '60 and there was much happening.
The more things change, the more they seem the same.
There were campus shootings by armed police and a sniper who took lives
&gt;from the bell tower.  Now kids go into schools armed and shoot to kill.
Drugs were prevalent.  Mothers little helpers.  Everyones mom had
something in the medicine cabinet at home.  Tons of pharmeceuticals...good
stuff, not this crap they make in the back of a panel trucks now.  They
tried to enforce dress codes back then and down on Hippies, same for
alternative lifestylers and grunge folk now.  Music was and still is King.
Cars too!
Sex still happens, but it was sooooo much safer 30 years ago.  Too bad for
the X generation.
Bottom line is, I can say that I've been there, done that and glad that I
didn't get stuck in some time warp but made the right choices and moved on
to bigger and better things.
