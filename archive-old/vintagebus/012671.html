&gt; I have located a front bullbar for a bus. The seller and I don't
what it
&gt; is worth. Can anyone help?

If professional quality and in good shape, around $100 would be a good
starting point.  Of course, it depends upon how much you want the
bullbars and how much he wants to keep them around.

I was _given_ a perfect full-length roof rack for our bus, as the
owner didn't want it cluttering up his garage any more.  It pays to
cultivate good Karma!

&gt; Also wondering if there were rear bullbars
&gt; too?

When was the last time you backed into a bull? :)
