&gt; I have an old trailer hitch, the kind that attaches to the torsion bar tubes

Hi VWVince,
That sounds like you might have a VOA hitch sold for bus in the USA.  These 
sandwich the lower lip of the bumper with a plate of steel inside the bumber 
bolted to the hitch, needing no holes drilled in the bumper.  Result is a 
hitch Eric can jump up and down on with his 200 Lbs. with no sign of failure. 
 We have used these hitches to tow bugs, KGs, and even a couple of buses with 
no problem with this style of hitch!
