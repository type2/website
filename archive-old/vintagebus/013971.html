&gt; hey,
&gt; i used to work for a gas &amp; welding place... saw some crazy safety
&gt; videos. 
&gt; since its friday i'll tell you about one. this guy was trying to make
&gt; an air 
&gt; compressor out of an old propane tank. he was in his back yard
&gt; holding the 
&gt; tank between his legs and using a monkey wrench to get the valve off.
&gt; 
&gt; apparently he slipped and created a little spark and the top 1/4 of
&gt; the tank 
&gt; blew off and took both his arms from the elbow down. one was in his
&gt; yard and 
&gt; the other was three of four houses down the street. TRUE STORY.
&gt; remember 
&gt; those tanks are NEVER empty after they have had propane in them. i
&gt; know 
&gt; everyone is pretty crafty on this list and wouldnt want to hear this 
&gt; happening to anyone. you may have done it or know someone who has
&gt; done it 
&gt; successfully but dont take the chance.

Wow!  That'll give me some good dreams for the next few days!

Yes, fuel tanks (of any type) are more dangerous empty then full.  The
reason is that an empty tank can have a mixture of air and fuel present
at a ratio that might be immediately combustable.  The whole mixture
goes off at once, releasing a bunch of energy.  The military uses this
effect to create fuel-air explosives, the most powerful explosives in
their arsenal short of nuclear.  In Vietnam, FAE were used to create
&quot;instant landing zones&quot; in the jungle by blowing down all trees for a
radius of more than a hundred yards.  Whoooom!

&gt; the tank should be ok on the rack, but personally i would be too
&gt; worried 
&gt; about it flying off no matter how good it is attached. it would take
&gt; out a 
&gt; car when it hits the ground. you can get a little 5 or 10lb. tank,
&gt; they are 
&gt; nice and small, will fit in any westy cabinet or closet and you wont
&gt; have to 
&gt; keep a window open. should burn for about 5-8 hours. plenty for a
&gt; weekend. 
&gt; the grill tanks are 20lb.ers, too big to haul around. i have a 10lb.
&gt; in my 
&gt; bus withh a hose running to a coleman stove and small round heater.

I'd disagree here.  It's never a good idea to put a tank inside a
closed vehicle, and all recreational vehicles put their tanks either
outside the vehicle or in compartments vented to the outside.  If you
put the tank inside and you have a leak, you will create a lovely FAE
bomb out of your entire bus.

You go out to your bus.  Open door.  Phew, whatta smell!  Slam door,
making tiny spark.  Meet St. Peter.

&gt; NOTE: BTW, ALWAYS KEEP THOSE TANKS UPRIGHT

Except, of course, for those tanks designed to operate on their sides!

It's OK to transport a normal propane tank on its side with the valve
closed.  It must be upright to draw gas properly.
