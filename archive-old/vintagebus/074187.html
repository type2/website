In the interime you can use standard valve heads punched to 90.5 until you get
your big valve heads fixed. I'd be looking for a NEW set of washers and clips
for your rocker arm shafts. There are several ads in the mags that have new
sets, or you can buy new rocker shaft assemblies with new hardware. I ran a
standard valve set of DP heads on two 1776 with no problems, of course I had
1.25:1 rockers to make up the difference between the standard valves and the
big valves.

I'm sure the answer is just as simple, I just can't remember.  Probably a
rediculous, &quot;Duh&quot; question, but for the life of me...

My rocker arm broke on my gorgeous 35.5x40 dual ports.  The arm pounded
away the top of the valve.  I put on a new clip, it broke, hit it some
more. I'll have the valve head fixed, but I need my bus on Monday.  I
have a dual port sitting in the garage... the block is in bad shape, but
the stock DP's are perfect.  I'd like to sway, but the Bus I'm driving
has a 1776 in it.  What's the best course here?  Can I just swap heads?
