I have a good data bank of those interested.
I have a good friend who owns a print shop who will get back to me this
Friday re: print costs for the T-I volumes ONLY for right now.  The T-II
volumes will take another week to get ready for the printer.  I will get
that info out as soos as possible.
I will reply to those that have shown interest only from now on.
I am going to include the volumes of info I have collected on gas heaters
too.  Factory templates for Eberspacher and Stewart Warner for T-I, T-II
and T-IIIs and to include all factory/sales
literature/schematics/operation.
Thanks!
