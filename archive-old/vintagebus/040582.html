Is anyone planning on going down on Thursday the 8th?  I might have to go
out to Irvine Lake and stake out my place early and wait for the masses.  Is
the campout at Christmas Tree Island open to anyone?

  It all starts Thursday in Lake Havasu, Colorado and New Mexico contingents
stopping in Lake Havasu Thursday to spend the night, carabus leaves Havasu 6
AM for the Lovely 6 hr cruise to Christmas Tree Island.
   Friday night there is a campout at Rich Yost House ( Christmas Tree
Island)  in Yucaipa (near Riverside), then there is a HUGE busavan from his
house down to the OCTO show, last year there were at least 40 buses and I'm
sure there will be a lot more this year.
     There are also 2 vendor parties (open to the public),1 is at West Coast
Metric and the other is at T M I, both of these are on Friday, most other
suppliers are also having impromptu parties for the Classic, call your
favorite Cali vendor for info.
      After OCTO a lot of people go there own ways for a place to stay Sat.
night, as far as I've heard Irvine Lake is the spot to camp again Sat night,
but I haven't received any info on this, ask  VWHoward  vwhoward_at_ctaz_dot_com he
has the info on this. From Irvine Lake there is the cruise to the Classic,
get up and go early to avoid the lines (ya right), not as bad as Kelly Park,
only takes an hour or so to get in.

Nobody has stepped forward yet to offer a listy meeting spot, so any and all
listys that would like to meet are all welcome to come by my swap spot at
either the Classic or the OCTO show, if your meeting someone there have them
stop by and let me know and I will pass the word on. I'll be in my Sealing
Brick Red double door with the 2 racks on top and the 1 wheel trailer with
the Cargo door sides on it. Just look for the bus parked the wrong direction
as I use my driver side door to access inside my bus
