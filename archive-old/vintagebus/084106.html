Subject: Headlights?

Hi Y'all,

                  Been tinkering with my headlight trying to get them cleaned/ painted and in proper working order and have run into a couple of snags I thought that at least one of you had experienced before. First is the adjusters, which way in the bucket are they supposed to fit? Little adjuster up and lateral and the larger adjuster down and medial, or opposit. I think I might have a headlight ring from another vehicle because one ring has two rivets holding the retaining tab that the screw goes through and the other ring has one rivet, any clues? Secondly does anybody have any suggestions on a service/workshop manual for these early busses. I have one and it is not very good. It shows Bay headlight when talking about the headlights and adjusting them. I'm trying to find a good schematic so I know everything is right.
