 Any ideas on how I can best repair a front door hinge?  It's starting to
 give way, so the door sags when open.  I can see where the inner section is
 starting to crack, but I'm sure that welding that crack is not the answer.
  &gt;&gt;
where is the crack?  usually where the hinge attaches to the door.  if so, 
you can either weld it or get a replacement hinge and weld that on.
