After Solvang, I just hope they let buses in at all! Since we are,
apparently, second class to bugs and all other vintage VWs! Eventually, I
expect they won't allow my EZ Camper either (or a Sundial!)

When they came for the bay windows I said nothing
When they came for the slammed splitties I said nothing
and when they came for the non-German coachbuilt buses...
no one was left to speak for me.

hahaha

Ok I'm done whining! :^)
