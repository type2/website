Hi Folks -

Yes, Steve is correct:
==========================
 &gt; :  On an early bus with teh bent arm that is on the throwout shaft, they 
bent
 &gt; :  it so it puts the clutch cable right into that bolt, makes it dang 
hard to
 &gt; :  get a wrench on it, at least it was for me.
 &gt;
 &gt; The only reason to want to get a wrench on it would be because it
 &gt; isn't a half-moon or have a tab attached.  Masochism is no excuse....

OR if you have a doghouse case with the threaded insert so that you have
to tighten that bolt from behind...
=============================

On my '61 single cab, with doghouse, a po had welded the head of a 15mm 
bolt onto the top of the 17mm drivers' side bolt.  I've ended up using a 
stubby wrench (nice shiny set of 'em from Harbor Freight for under $15 - 
very useful in tight quarters) with the drivers' rear tire off, truck 
jacked up, and arm inserted from the wheel housing area however possible to 
get past the bent arm of the throwout shaft and onto the blessed nut.

Maestro Dan (Dan's VW here in Tucson) puts it up on his hoist and uses a 
(guessing) 36&quot;+ extension and socket from in front of and over the tranny 
to get to it; but what can he know after only 27 years of doing it?

Nick..
