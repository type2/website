Find somebody with long arms!  I can get to my plugs with the right length of extender. Dellortos on  a doublecab.  A swivel could help. Get a real plug socket with a rubber insert to hold the plug. You don't need to see it, just feel the socket slide into place. You can't lose the plug anywhere. 
I suggest using 12mm bolts on the intake manifold. Much easier to pull the carbs when needed. Got mine at CB Performance, they're a bit taller than the 13mm and make it easier to get a wrench on 'em near the larger manifolds.
