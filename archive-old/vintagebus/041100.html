I once bought an old bus that had sat near a swamp for many years.  ($20) My
buddy Erik actually drove it home!  But part of the bargain was that the
tires were to be returned to seller.  I just could not budge some of those
bolts!  I swear, I got 4 out of 5 bolts out of one of the rear wheels, and
just continued to break tools trying to remove the 5th.  Finally, in
frustration, I drove the bus several miles with that single bolt holding the
wheel on!  It never budged!  I mean, I tried rocking the bus with the bolt
at 9:00, sledge hammering, torches, any kind of abuse you might try on a
junkyard bus... I finally drilled out.  (That bad bus was named the &quot;White
Death&quot; by my grandfather, who is now 94 yrs old.  It was one of those that
are good mechanically, but the walls literally flap in the wind due to inch+
gaps between sides and floor.)
