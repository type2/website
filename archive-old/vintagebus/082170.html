&gt;&gt;  1. Upon draining the transaxle the oil had a few pieces  of metal about 
1/4 the size of a match head as well a quite a bit of brass  flakes. I don't 
think the oil had been drained since the rebuild. I bought  this van 2 years ago 
and haven't drained it myself, since it leaked ( mostly  at the nose cone) I 
just replaced oil occasionally. Also I haven't had any  trouble shifting or 
popping out of gear. Anyway do you guys think this is  something to worry about? 
&lt;&lt;
Hi Mike,
Sounds OK, but would change gear oil again in 500 miles to help clean it  out 
better.  Good idea to buy, or borrow a tach later for a fifteen minute  drive 
with a passenger to write down where you hit 3,000 RPM at what MPH in all  
forward gears and 1,500 RPM in 2-4th gear.

&gt;&gt;    2. About the nose cone and bushing. Should I  try to find a new bushing 
and
install it myself or are rebuilt nose cones  available? The part number on the
transaxle is 113.301.103 E then below  that AH 2671468.  &lt;&lt;
If the old bushing made its way out, the bore the bushing goes into is  
probably shot.  Best to take or send your nose cone somewhere to have it  
inspected, fixed, rebushed, or replaced.
