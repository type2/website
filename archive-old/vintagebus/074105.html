&gt; How many different lengths of heater cable are there?  Is one side longer

Hi Steve,
Only one length!  We have installed heater cables in our 1963 SC and 1960 
walk thru panel camper conversion.  The trick is to bend the cable in the correct 
place in the middlish and can take a couple of tries.
  Probably the best way is to remove the heater knob and feed the cable in 
both tubes.  Once the ends are through the back Vise-Grip each end to keep them 
from slipping back into the cable tubes and pull on the middle with a hook or 
perhaps a piece of coat hanger put on the cable before installing it, to get 
the exact place for the knob/pin connection.
   Also are you using the heater boxes for pre-1968 buses or the later bus 
ones where the swing arms of the heater boxes are much higher than the earlier 
style and thusly will not work with the stock cable or in a pre-1968 bus 
properly.
