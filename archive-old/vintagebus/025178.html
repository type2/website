&gt; &gt;  I have seen so many single cab conversions it makes me sick.

You know, these were inexpensive commercial vehicles that were made to
be used, and modified so that they could be used. They were not
manufactured so that thirty years later a bunch of us pencil-necked vw
geeks could get all steamy at how straight the rockers and gates are.
