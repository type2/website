&gt;..........
&gt;
&gt;where are you at with it all at the moment?

Hi Andy
The VW cam hunting was put on hold Tuesday &amp; Wednesday while I got kidnapped
by my host to drive all over Miami &amp; meet his friends.  Tomorrow the quest for
a completely worn out used up cam will begin anew &amp; for sure I'll start
calling that list of guys you suggested.  Thanks for following up.  I
appreciate it.


Thanks also to Mike Benthin for passing on the specifics of his Key West
adventures.

&gt;Can you point us to a site where we can hear the Kerouac reading?
&gt;Please...........

The Kerouac reading on The Steve Allen Show from November 16, 1959 is just
really, really good.  Steve Allen is playing semi-improvised jazz piano w/ a
small combo in the background while Kerouac does 3 or 4 minutes of
strung-together fragments from &quot;On The Road&quot; &amp; &quot;Visions of Cody&quot; (which
incidentally was
written first &amp; had the working title of &quot;On The Road&quot; until JK decided to
completely set it aside &amp; start over).  This piece came off a 3-CD boxed set
called
&quot;The Beat Generation&quot; on Rhino, which is maybe 25% music that inspired the
Beats &amp; 25% Beat era authors doing readings.  The remaining material is more
or
less representative of the Beat-inspired cultural explosion that ensued &amp; not
everything here is worth owning.  (But read the enclosed booklet to discover
that insipid &quot;poet&quot; Rod McKuen was a CIA agent during the '50's while, whether
using the alias Bob McFadden or his real name, he was performing so-called
&quot;Beat music&quot; which in fact consisted mainly of lyrics designed to promote
negative
Beat stereotypes.  Believe it or not, the CIA's technique was roughly on par
w/ Kevin Nealon's &quot;subliminal message&quot; skits on SNL from the early 90's.)  The
boxed set sells for around $35 but I got it from the library.  If your
library doesn't own a copy maybe I can try sending you the Kerouac on Steve
Allen
&quot;link&quot; ;-) via pmail.  There are several documentaries out on video which
feature film clips from the Steve Allen reading &amp; at least one that has it
from
start to finish.  Here's the listing from the library's online catalog:
