Sorry about the none VW content but I felt the need share this with
you.
RENT the musical.  The soundtrak has had a huge effect on my life.  I
have asked many people I know and none of them know much about it
although they have heard of it.  Anyways the reason for me sending
this message unrelated to VW's is that I am very desperate to know
what the woman and her future boyfriend look like and what they are
wearing when they sing &quot;light my candle&quot;  Just so I have a better idea
of what to imagine.  The musical &quot;RENT&quot; is no longer playing in
California.  What does the scenery look like?  What about their hair? 
Cloths?  How much taller is Roger?  At the end of the song she sings
&quot;they call me, me__ me_________&quot;  what does she mean by that?  Any
ideas on what they are doing while singing?  Are they looking around
inside her dresser drawer?  Are they feeling around the floor for the
candle she droped in the dark?  Has there been a power outage or have
they turned off her heat and electricity because she can't pay the
bills?  I figured maybe she can't pay her bills since she lives in an
apartment in new york, where the story takes place.
It's the best musical I have ever came across.  Very well put together
with LOTS of thought.  There is a good lesson to be learned, I would
recomend it to anyone.  From what I hear the Musical was a big hit in
this area and that the theater was always sold out.
And for other RENT enthusiasts, just so you know if you don't already.
The writer won't be writing anymore.  Not because he doesn't want to
but because he's dead.  He had been missdiagnosed twice in New York
hospitals.  He died at home in his kitchen with an exploaded heart. 
He died the day before his musical opened for buisness.  It's a shame
this had to happen, his work is so impressive.  Amagine all the
potential he had...
