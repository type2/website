&lt;&lt; I still think that the best place for the filter is just after the outlet 
of the fuel tank.  A bit messier to change, but it will protect the lines and

Hi George,
Which is why along with replacing the flex fuel lines we are planning to 
install reserve switches in all our later buses.  Then we can adjust the 
reserve switch by hand underneath and shut off all the fuel from the tank.  
Making all this type of work much nicer.  Eric&amp;Barb
