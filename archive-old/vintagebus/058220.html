Subject: Re: [VB] New VB owner with some first questions

Good point, but hm, I took his question to be about whether the car was 
converted to 12V or not.

Both the starter (the big cylinder) and the solenoid (the little cylinder) 
are stamped with the voltage they were designed to use.   

The starter has a gear with teeth that match the flywheel.   if they don't 
match, it makes horrible noises and is bad.   there is one that matches the 
6V FW, and a different size that match the 12V FW.   

Now say you have a perfectly good motor with a 12V FW and you want to pop it 
in your 6V bus?   You can take the 6V solenoid and put it on a 12V starter.

Or if you have an engine with a 6V FW  (maybe it has a stepped crank and you 
can't find a 12V stepped crank FW) and you want to put it in your 12V bus, or 
the bus was changed from 6V to 12V.   You can use a 6V starter with a 12V 
solenoid on it.

So ya, its a good idea to check both cylinders for the marking stamped into 
them.

(But it is not a good idea to bench test a starter unless you have a tranny 
bell housing with the right starter bushing to test it in, as they are not 
self supported- unless you get the rare autostick version)

 &gt; remove it, wipe off the solenoid and see what voltage is stamped into it.
 
 Hi Volks,
 This will work for the most part, but not in some others.  We install 12 
volt 
 solinoids on 6 volt starters whilst using this combo in 12 volt buses.  So 
 this means we have 6 volt solinoids on 12 volt starters in our parts pile!
