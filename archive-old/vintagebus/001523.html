gone a couple of days, way lots of e-mail
sorry for all the late replys, well anyway hears some scoop

bug-a-rama in phoenix was the best yet, plenty of
of good bus parts scores by me and a lot of others
nice to get some good parts at some good prices
got me a nice aluminum side step for the camper
and a pair of late 50's/60's tailights and some other junk

just got back from rescueing 6 may be 7 splits from the
crusher, the reason i say seven is the seventh one is pretty well cut-up
there is 1 double door panel, 2 kombis, 1 sundial, 1 pop-top westy (interior
and
top gone, and a single cab that drove under a flat bed (gates and trans
gone)
perfect bed and treasure chest floor, most are stripped but at least 3 maybe
4
can be resurected with parts from the others, they are pretty dry and rust
free
been sitting a long time, this was a VWhoward find but with bugarama and all
i took the plung and took my second road trip in as many days,(john was to
tired to make the trip, so i kept him informed via  the cell phone) put on a
lot of miles
and am really tired, can't wait to sleep but my mind just keeps buzzing with
what
to do with this find, there will be some original sheet metal available off
a couple of these so if there some odd metal you need please let me know
before next weekend
as thats when we're going to get them (another road trip) then whats left
gets crushed.

to clean engine compartments i use oven cleaner think about it, baked on
grease
wipe it off, i use it on engines, trannys and engine bays works great and
it's cheap
