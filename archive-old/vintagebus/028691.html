Hi Melissa and Jerry

Just wanted to let you know that I received your tape of the &quot;OCTO Meet, The
Toy Show, and The Classic 2000&quot; and finally had time to look at it all. It is
great! I wasn't able to go to the OCTO Show, but your tape sure showed me what
I missed. Your coverage of the Toy Show, and The Classic is first class!  I
saw a lot of listee's on your tape, and you have some very good shots of
almost all the vehicles. Put me on your list for the next coverage!

Thanks again,

Don Boneau
Oceanside, Ca.
