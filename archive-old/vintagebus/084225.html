Subject: Re: [VB] Bucking.

I had a similar problem. While driving on the freeway at top speed, my 
1600sp would start bucking. I could drive on the surface streets or 
slower on the freeway with no problem. What I found was a piece of the 
rubber hose had sheared off and stuck in the hole that leads to the 
needle valve. It didn't effect the operation of the needle valve, it 
just reduced the flow of fuel. If the fuel level in the bowl is high 
enough to run at 60mph, wouldn't it be high enough at 70mph? It wouldn't 
stay at the proper level if there was a restriction in the flow of fuel. 
I would check the tank filter, line filter, fuel pump, and look for a 
clogged orifice.

the engine bucked when I lifted my foot off the gas just
a little. Did that until I slowed down to around 60 for a few minutes. It
did it again when I returned to left lane cruise speed. All I can think of
is that there was not enough fuel in the carb bowl. I have a weber 2 barrel
progressive. My fuel pressure regulator is set to 3-1/2. I started with it
at 2-1/2.
