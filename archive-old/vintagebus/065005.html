No need to get upset.

&gt; The oil sloshes forward, the oil sloshes backwards, it sloshes to the
&gt; right and to the left and that plate is the lowest point. It's that
&gt; simple.
&gt; That is why the sludge collects there.

That is true.  So, why doesn't the sludge slosh right out when you drain
the oil?  Because the boss prevents it from doing so, right?  Wouldn't it
be better to have the boss on the other side so that the bottom of the
sump is truly the drain?  As it is, a quantity of oil remains above the
sump plate even when the oil stops dripping.
