I am looking for a frame or a set from Oliver Imported Cars which was on 
Shattuck Ave in Berkeley.  Went belly up in the late 60's I am told.  But my 
64 bus used to have one of their plate frames on the back before I got it.  
It said BERKELEY at the top and OLIVER at the bottom.  I have been asking 
around about these for 2 years, no luck.  No VW emblems on these frames...

I saw one on a very rusty oval in a junkyard.  One of those deals where you 
keep asking when you can get parts of the car, repeated give them your phone 
number and ask them to call when it can be parted, then you drop by and it 
was crushed.  Very cool dealer tag.
