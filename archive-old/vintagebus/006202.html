Around here, we have a lot of interest in stock car racing and all these
guys have nailed down the best ways to strap their cars down.  The best way
I've seen on their stock cars is a chain around each axle on either side of
the differential and in turn, the chains are hooked to the trailer.  Then
they use a come-a-long to pull the vehicle forwards - maintaining tension on
the cable and the chains.  I did something very similar - a chain around
each swingaxle and hooked the trailer and a cable around the front beam
someplace and anchored to the trailer.  As an added safety measure, I hooked
a chain around the beam and to the trailer and wired it down in case the
cable on the come-a-long broke.  This way I at least had some minor tension
on the vehicle - enough to keep it from falling off...
