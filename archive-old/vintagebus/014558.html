 &gt;&gt;Stock pulleys vary as to timing notches -- but I think 3 of them
should be 7.5, 5, 0, reading clockwise.			

Beware that different year pulleys had different notches on them.  Some had a 
notch for 10 degrees also.  The Muir book has a chart but of course this is 
assuming that the pulley is the original one on the original engine.  Maybe 
some of our &quot;anal trivia&quot; fans can provide a parts number of each type for 
reference.

Now for something completely different: Is anyone swapping or showing at Sac 
this weekend?  Maybe the spot can be a meeting place for listees
