&gt; It appears that one of my head studs is pulling out of the case.

&gt; Here is a picture of the stud pulling out:

Oh man, that looks bad. I see a case saver on the end of that pulled
stud. There might be a larger case saver you can use, but I've never
heard of one. It looks like a 10mm stud too. The smaller 8mm studs have
a factory insert in the case. There's a better chance of a bigger case
saver being available for the 8mm studs, but I haven't seen one of those
either. I would say it's time to start planning that rebuild, in a new
case. You can still drive this engine around town for a while, but I
would rule out any road trips. Maybe someone else on the list knows some
cool tricks for fixing this, but it looks like the end of this case to
me.
