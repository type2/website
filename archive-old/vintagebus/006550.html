I have a couple of middle seats from bay window buses. They will fit in
split buses. [ I have a full width bay seat in my 67] They will need to be
recovered if you don't like basket weave. I have a 72 and older 3/4 seat
with armrest. I have your choice of full width seat, 72 and older or 73 -79.
The difference between 72 and 73 is headrest holes. 73 and up has them.  The
full width seat has the flop down 1/3 seat back to get into the rear seat.
$50 each.
I am in Fresno, Calif. and I can bring them to Kelly Park next Sunday to
save shipping......
