Having installed such belts in my 67 Westy, they are doable and nice. Belts 
are available with inertia reels that can be attached to the seat stand/wheel 
well on the outboard side of each seat. Backup the installation bolt with a 
3&quot; + washer for safety.
The inboard side works best if mounted on a steel bar from the stock seat 
belt bolt location, at least on my walk through. This puts the receiver right 
where you hand looks for it.
The inertia reel allows shifting, radio tuning, heater and defroster 
adjusting, etc.,
