er- isn't that mixed up- the bus has a .82 4th and the bug has a .89 4th.

I know someone who has a flipped ring bug trans in his bus and LIKES it 
because it hauls up the hills loaded in 4th better.

&gt;In 1959 1/2 - 1960 model year the bus engine was bus only.  

This was the &quot;Bastard&quot; 40 HP-ish engine, right?

&gt;Due to the normal stock bus used a .87 fourth gear also used in the KG 
&gt;tranny, just flipping the ring over to the other side in a bug tranny
&gt;with it's .82 fourth gear would result in alot slower bus or higher
&gt;engine RPM at highway speeds.

At least it would get you rolling for cheaper than a new tranny, but
the slowness and engine wear might soon wipe out any savings.  :)

Thanks for the corrections!
