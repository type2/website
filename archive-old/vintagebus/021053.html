sounds as if you have had it with the old bus.I have
been in my bus for 7 years now and there have been
times like that.I guess it sure would help to have
some fancy new  SUV caddy sitting out front for the
daily driver and your bus as a hobby....&quot;Oh look thats
so cute... the old buses headlights have popped
out!She looks funny that way&quot;...Not so funny if you
have to drive it to work on a wet dark night with your
head and flashlight out the window.I know where you
are coming from...I think.If you dont need the
money(Hey..who does?) from selling your bus..just keep
her.Maybe she will age more gracefully from now on and
you might fall for her again.I sure wish I had some of
my old cars back....even if they were just piles of
rust hiding under car covers....Oh..wait..I have one
of those..a 64 T-Bird..I got to keep that one it saved
my life! Hang in there
Bro...._at__at__at__at__at__at__at__at__at__at__at__at__at__at__at__at__at__at__at__at__at__at__at__at__at__at__at_       On the bright
side my POS(haha) is not getting much closer to the
gas station for a fill up.Lot's of work to
do....Anyone know anymore about that capped off left
side of my heat duct...missing &quot;Log&quot;Can you even get
one of those? Guess I should look in the archive for
info and then Thoms site for pictures...._at__at__at__at__at__at__at__at__at__at__at__at__at__at__at__at__at__at__at__at__at__at__at__at_
