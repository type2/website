What timing !
My sp 1600 has developed a fairly major head to cylinder leak.
I have put 60,000 hard miles on her.
I want to stay with a sp but have been considering a new engine.
I have not found a source for a sp new motor and was considering a short
block,
but if you will make the conversion, that's great !

I would like to know the price of a new longblock with  new sp heads.
And how long would it take to get , as BNNTA is coming up?
(I live in Illinois.)
Are the new motors solid lifters ?
What other details can you provide ?
THANKS !!

&gt; you need the rear tin piece, for the doghouse cooler, this is a 71 only
bus
&gt; part, also I will be converting some of the new longblocks to single ports
&gt; for those that want a brand new single port, useing OEM single port heads.
