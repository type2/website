Subject: Need help on my '66 

This is my first post, hopefully I did it right!
I bought a '66 bus that was already lowered, using lowering spindles in
the front.
Everthing is fine except on big bumps the front tires bottom out on the
wheel well.
It needed new tires so I tried one size smaller tire and that helped a
little but no cure. I installed new shocks. I know that is was not a
cure but I figured it may help on the recoil. Since my front axle is
original and probably &quot;tired&quot;, should I replace the whole front beam or
can I replace parts of the suspension to bring it's strength back to new
and hope that cures my problem. Is this problem typical of an old bus
(it's my first one)?
