Subject: [VB] Rear spring plate adjustment


Hello,

I just finished installing a straight axle kit on my 63 single cab and when 
I set it down off of the jack stands the wheels are tucked in (negative 
camber?) Which way do I need to move the plates to get zero camber? I used 
an inclinometer to set the plates at 7 degrees at the recommendation of 
wolfgangs do I need to go up or down?

The engine is in and I bounced on the back of the truck to try to get it to 
sit down more but it seems like it has completely settled.

Thanks,
Bob

Bob,
according to the Bently manual, the setting for the factory spring plates is
20 degrees for the truck/bus and other settings for the fire truck and
ambulance. I had built myself a degree gauge and a spring plate compression
tool to do my 67 SC and it worked very well.
