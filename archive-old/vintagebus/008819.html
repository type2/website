Dan Kinsey, Binz owner said:
&gt; I don't think so.  Of course I could be totally wrong but I think the Binz
is actually undervalued right now.  Bottom line on &quot;value&quot; is supply and
demand.  The supply of Binz is incredibly low.  After looking for 3 years I
have found only 12 Binz and some of those are in junkyards.  I would bet
there are fewer Binz out there than there are Hebmeullers.  We all know that
busses are *way* cooler than bugs (even if it is a Heb) so then why isn't
the Binz price equal to the Heb? Because *right now* there is a lack of
demand for the Binz.
&gt;
I would tend to disagree and I love VW trucks!  VW trucks have always been
worth less and unless they suddenly become more popular with the people who
pay maximum dollar, the prices of Binzes will remain low, coachbuilt or not.

Yes, there are probably fewer Binzes than Hebs, yes they may be more rare.
They are probably less sideloader Single Cabs and ladder trucks and cherry
pickers too but they are not worth the same as Deluxes...

There are more than 12.

If someone is really interested in the one on my site, you should call the
guy, hint, hint.  The price is wayyy too high, IMHO.  The one in Florida is
too high too, it should be about $3k based on the condition as explained to
me by phone.

I felt there should be a counter-point.
