&gt; Hello All,
&gt;  Got a few questions for yall...
&gt; First, Didnt a bus come with storage spot to keep the
&gt; churchkey in? Seems I remember seein one on a rusted
&gt; out westy.. lower left when seated in the drivers seat
&gt; if memory serves correctly... mabey a S/C didnt have
&gt; one?

I can say for sure that the Deluxe bus had a holder that was mounted on
the middle screw of the three that hold the left side of the kick panel
in place. My crewcab came with the completely stripped interior option,
so I can't say for sure on the truck.

&gt;  Second, does anyone know what went in the steering
&gt; colume bracket in the spot opposite of the ignition
&gt; switch? Mine has a clear plastic plug in it.

The plug covers the hole where the switch for the rear interior light
would have been mounted. Trucks don't have rear lights, so the hole gets
a plug.


This reminds me of something I've been wondering about. My crewcab has a
set of holes over the back window that are obviously mounting holes for
an interior light. Does anyone have a crewcab that has a light back
there that looks factory? I haven't seen all that many crewcabs, but
I've never seen one with a rear interior light.
