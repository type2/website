Subject: rings stuck to pistons? update

To the friendly and knowledgeable list members,

Tonight I cleaned the plugs and poured some more motor oil in each
spark plug hole followed by a squirt of starting fluid and then put 
the plug back in, for each cylinder then a squirt in the carb.
It ran with lots of smoke for a few seconds (until the plugs fouled,
probably.) Tomorrow after church I'll pull and clean the plugs
again and a compression check as well and retard the timing a little.

My carb needs work; but when I used to work at Rising Sun Engines
as a installer we used to test engines all the time without a carb 
even on the manifold (now they use natural gas with a lot of 
different fittings for each type engine they import used from Japan)
Check out my resume links on my web site if you are interested in a
subaru to swap into your bus or whatever for a japanese import. I
Think I will swap the carb or tear into this one tomorrow as well.
With my compression as low as it is now, every little bit helps.

Boy was it sounding like it wanted to run tonight though. I think
this engine needs to be given a chance on the rings it's got.

From the manatee backwaters of the gulf coast at tampa bay 
through the bleakness of west texas 
and across the sea to our golden valley of Makaha...
goodnight world and Aloha
Ken Alford
