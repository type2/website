&gt; I thought I had a busted the clutch cable yesterday but
&gt; it turned out to be fine. That's because I actually had an extra
&gt; with me. The pedal went to the floor without the
&gt; normal resistance but still would spring back up but with no clutch action.
&gt; I got a crash course in clutchless driving as I
&gt; held up traffic a little when I couldn't get it into first at a stop sign.
&gt; I'm guessing the fork deal
&gt; that holds the throw out bearing is busted somehow.
&gt; I have not pulled the engine yet
&gt; to take a look at it.
&gt; What is involved with this repair?
&gt; Does this part have to pressed in?

Not too hard of a repair.  PUll engine, remove snap ring from end of
clutch shaft, remove clutch arm from shaft with the return spring.  remove
the small bolt that lives just forward of the throwout shaft.  Slide the
bushing to the left.  Remove throwout shaft.

I recommend getting a new shaft from dunebuggy suppliers.  They are a lot
better than the VW parts.  Make sure yhou get the right one as there are
several variations.
