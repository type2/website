&lt;&lt; I'm looking for a rebuilt 1600dp longblock for my '67 Westy.  &gt;&gt;
Hi Jim,
If time is of the essense then try Bear's VW machine at 241 W. 35th Suite E., 
National City, CA 91950.  Thier phone number is (619) 691-8385.  
  We needed an engine quickly three years ago, and they built us a SP 1641 
with counterbalanced crank, and new VW of Brazil heads which they had 
remachined the exaust valve guides to allow the installation of stock size 
exaust valves with thicker stems.  With the larger stem these valves stay 
cooler, and have stronger stems to help stop having the heads of the valves 
from breaking off, and damaging the engine, especially # 3.  Over all we have 
had 40,000+ trouble free miles, and are just about to take it out for a strip 
down to long block to retorque all the fasteners, reset the endplay of the 
crankshaft, and replace the flywheel seal.  To keep the engine nice, and 
tight for the next 40,000+ miles.
  Please tell Butch there that we said &quot;Hi!&quot;.   Thanks,    Eric&amp;Barb
