I have seen that set up too.  Ya, good Idea to take it off and put a regular 
oil cooler on it before driving it enough to get it hot, doghouse if you have 
thestuff.   Take the air and sucks it through the oil cooler so preheated air 
can ?Cool? the head and cylinder fins. hmmmm.

Actually, what would be really nifty is if you can put a temp guage in it(beg 
borrow or steal), drive it a bit, then change the cooler and tell us what 
happens with the oil temp.

&lt;&lt; the motor is a 1600 sp as far as i can tell and has an oil filter setup
 on it.  ok, thats fine....good actually.  i wondered where they routed
 the lines from....yup...you guessed it.  they used the adaptor that
 mounts where the oil cooler mounts...but they eliminated the stock oil
 cooler :(  instead... the person who rebuilt the motor decided to put an
 oil cooler on the front (FIF) of the fan shroud over the opening of the
 fan.  bad.  this does cool the oil...but blows more hot air over the
 engine...am i correct??  i do want this motor to last, and i plan on
 taking it out to remove this setup and install a doghouse fan shroud and
 cooler...or even a type 4 cooler if i get ambitious.  The bus still has
 the triangular air filter bracket...which i will need to mount on the
 fan shroud....don't know how yet...but i'll figure that out later.
  one
 of my questions is... why did people do this???? this setup was on a
 friend's 62 bus also...  that motor had one helluva rod knock to it on
 #3... seems to me it got really hot quite often.&gt;&gt;
