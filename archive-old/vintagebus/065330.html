perhaps you could try something a little bit less abrasive? When I
used to reload ammo I used a tumbler filled with walnut shells to
clean the brass. Brass is very soft &amp; it only gets all the powder &amp;
dirt off the cases. Might work well for bolts as well &amp; (hopefully)
leave a nice luster.
