Only one thing to say here.  I have never driven a new car .. I have driven
ONLY aircooled VWs .. I have dumped tons of money into them, but I would NEVER
.. let me repeat .. NEVER be happy driving a new car, nor would I consider it
.. even when I am stuck in traffic for an hour - in August - in Florida - with
no air conditioning .. diane
