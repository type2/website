Subject: Driving my Double Cab

I've been using my beat up old Double Cab to drive to work most days of the 
week. It's been nice to me at the gas pump!

One thing I notice is that Double Cab trucks do get a lot of 
interest...even beat up ugly ones.

The other thing I notice...I'm not really a big Double Cab guy. It's cool 
and all that, but just isn't really my bag. I'd much rather have my single 
cab to drive....with the full bed.

But I do think I'll hang onto this truck for my son or something like that. 
He's only 6 right now, so that gives me 10 years!

I am very happy to be driving a bus again though. I like the feeling. 
Nothing else like it. I also do like having a truck. Great for going to the 
lumber yard or hauling crap. So I'm happy with the DC overall. It's 
definitely serving it's purpose.

Glad to be driving a bus again!
