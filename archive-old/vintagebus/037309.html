On a whim I decided to hook up my dwell meter to my ignition system and see
where the dwell is with the pertonix ignition. It did not read 50 as I
expected it should. It read more like 40. Has anyone else checked this, and
should the dwell read correctly or is there a reason the pertronix reads
this way?
