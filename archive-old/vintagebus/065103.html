Subject: Re: [VB] POR15

POR-15 is fine for stuff that doesn't see sunlight, and it even
holds up OK on stuff does that does  see daylight.

I put the POR-15 on, then in about 15 minutes, while it's still tacky,
I mist on a light layer of paint.  When thsat's dry, I paint it the
rest of the way.  I don't like undercoatings; there's something inherently
dishonest about them.  Plus they flake off when yoou're trying to do stuff
under there.

&gt; The website says they are damaged by UV  light - but as they won't be in
&gt; direct sunlight I cannot see this being a problem.
&gt; I was also going to paint the underside of the front of my bus with POR15
&gt; and then spray bodyshutz on - do I need a top coat for this?
