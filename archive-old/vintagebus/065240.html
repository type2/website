&gt; Has ANYONE gotten ANYTHING from JCW, that's worth ANYTHING?  I inquire
&gt; because I never even thought of buying VW parts from anywhere BUT a VW
&gt; house.  There is always the emergency local part house stop.  But that is
&gt; just to get you by until you find the correct part.  But maybe I'm missing
&gt; something...

A lot of stuff JCW sells is the same as you'd get anywhere else.  A lot of
it is pure junk.  The bad thing is that you can't tell which is which.
Even brand-name stuff (remember back when JCW _never_ stated brand names?)
comes in various levels of quality.

&gt; Of course, I have always been intrigued by JCW's collection of air horns!

I like the one that plays &quot;La Cucaracha&quot;  It's so... so... multicultural
