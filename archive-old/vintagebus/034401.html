As promised I have uploaded some (crappy) pictures
of seat belt mounts that meet Australian Design
Regulations without gross bus butchery (well I think
so anyway 8-))......

If you want to look you can go there direct :

Or go to my main page and follow the somewhat
tortuous 'update' pages..

As I said, if there is enough interest I would
be happy to pictorially outline this procedure
on another bus...(you gotta do it here to drive
em as fully registered vehicles anyway...)
