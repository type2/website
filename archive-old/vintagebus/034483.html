&lt;&lt; I think that's oil.  But the oil degrades very quickly (become black)

Do I have to put the sealant on the gasket? &gt;&gt;
Hi Michael,
OK, remove your oil dipstick and stick under your nose (Not up it!) to smell 
the oil.  If you have more than 50 miles on the oil change and have an fuel 
leak it should smell like gasolene.  The paper gaskets should not leak oil 
unless there is a gouge scratched into the case, fuel pump flange base or the 
base of the fuel pump itself.  As it sounds you probably need to rejet your 
carb not to run so rich that it is blacking the oil, or fix what ever fuel 
leak in the pump or carb.  Having oil turn black without a filter after 3,000 
miles could be due to bad rings, but it is a good idea to check for fuel 
leakage problems to make sure and not cause the rings to go bad which too 
much fuel to the P&amp;Cs will do.   Eric&amp;Barb
