Ok then, I would say that all you people that own 67's, see ya on the other 
side of the gate. Pre 12 volt is where its at. Or, we could include 67 buses, 
but reject 67 beetles; only cars with early style headlight buckets.

&lt;&lt; Y'know, that seems to be a very arbitrary division.  Why a '67 bus and not
 a '68?  Both vehicle share most of the same design details and differ
 only in the cosmetics of the body and a few running gear improvements
 (which '67-down folks seem to love to incorporate into their buses)  The
 line is even thinner between '67 and '68 bugs.
 
 If you're going to create a rift, why not pick an important change, such
 as a change from rear engine/drive to front engine/drive?  A Rabbit is
 obviously different from a Bug and a Eurovan is different from a Vanagon.
