Subject: Re: [VB] middle seat kick panel question

I don't know about full length middle seats, but I do know that the
walk-through middle seats are one year only for '67.  I was lucky enough to
have one included with a kick panel when I bought my bus.

&gt; Hey volks,
&gt;
&gt;    I just bought a middle seat kick panel for my 67 deluxe full length
middle
&gt; seat, but it doesn't fit correctly. The guy I bought it from said that it
came
&gt; from a 66 deluxe, did the seats change frmo 66 to 67? Mine has a bar that
goes
&gt; from top to bottom that gets in the way of the mounting metal pieces.  Any
&gt; help would be very nice. I would also trade somebody this one for one
correct
&gt; for my bus. This one is in awesome shape.
