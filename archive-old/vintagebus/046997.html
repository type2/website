Subject: spring plate degrees
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

    I put new spring plate bushings in the 59' today and while reinstalling 
could not get the required 20 degrees as the plate would bottom out on the 
lower stop. I am installing 67 spring plates as the 59 was lowered when I got 
it, but have been told they are the same. Are the 59's required number of 
degrees different from 63-67 or am i misunderstanding the procedure as laid 
out in the bently? Should I set the plates at 20 degrees and then use a floor 
jack to raise them up onto the lower stop? 
Thanks,
Ronnie C
