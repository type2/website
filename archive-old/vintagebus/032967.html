Hi Jeff and List,

	I have a the more detailed version of this list.

	unfortunately, I am at work and the list is buried somehwere at
home.

	I also have the compressed version (as submitted by Jeff) in my
wallet.

	I'll try and remember to bring it in and then I can OCR it for
distribution.

	I also have a complette list of VW stuff in Sunset Magazine
(Califonia Mag) from like 61-67.  I compiled that myself when I was
fortunate enough to aquire an entire Susnet Mag set at the SwapMeet!
