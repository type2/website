&lt;&lt; Also...I'm thinking about replacing the wiring loom completely, I'd
appreciate hearing from someone who has done this in the past. It seems all
my wiring has been patched together with crimp-on connectors and haphazard
color/gauges of wire. &gt;&gt;
Hi John,
This is something that definitely is a problem.  We have in the past had good
results by getting wiring harnesses out of dead VWs and using this to match
the old wiring in our VWs.  With soldering and heat shrinking the result is
the same and sves you the $200.00 of a new wiring harness.  Crimp-on
connectors suck unless properly soldered.
