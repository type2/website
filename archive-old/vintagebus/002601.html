Subject: Where not to POR 15?
Date: Sat, 30 Jun 2001 00:29:21 -0400
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

I'm in the process of completely stripping down my 65 to a rolling shell,
and would like to get an idea of where not to POR 15 once I'm there.  The
frame and floorpans are in overall excellent condition, and I want to keep
them that way.  The 71 will be next to undergo this process.  Any
suggestions on prep for the POR 15 to make it as effective as possible,
including what can and can't be applied to a surface treated with it are
also welcome.  There is alot of info in the archives on what people did, but
I'm also interested in stuff I shouldn't put it on.  My fingers and hands
stayed maroon for quite a while when I &quot;accidentaly&quot; got a similar product
on them a couple of years back and I almost failed chemistry in high school,
so quite frankly, the stuff makes me nervous.  However, with the list(s)
help I am willing to face my fears. ;)

Thanks,
Don Johnson
