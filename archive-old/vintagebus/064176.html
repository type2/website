Subject: VW 256a?

Does anyone have an ID for a 256a? Appears to be a set of hefty rods,
but don't seem to be for a pressing operation, as they are turned
silvery steel, not hefty black steel. Both have a blob of grease in the
end, and a plate is the 3rd piece. Just going through the tool pile, and
can't find this one in my bus manual.


Thanks,
AL
