There are numerous stock C/W cranks. SCAT sells a CAST CW crank, same as in
all the mag/rags (only one company makes these). The Berg ones are stock
cranks, welded counterweights, I don't know if these are done in house or
purchased by them, if they use a 1500 crank or 1600 cross drilled.  DPR,
DeMello, CB and GEX all sell and manufacture welded counterweighted cranks
and seem to supply 80%per cent of the aftermarket. The cast CW cranks are
fine as long as you don't rev higher then 5000 rpm (this is where they might
break) and are questionable if they would be good to use in a bus engine due
to torque load, but I have run cast cranks (verses forged)in bus engines
without a problem. As far as rods I would be more concerned with these then
a crank. I have gotten rebuilt balanced (ha-ha) from numerous different
suppliers and have had different weights, styles of rods, different pin
heights and rods with a slight twist in them. None of this would rely HURT
an engine, but would take away longevity. I now take all my rebuilt rods to
my local machine shop and have them checked and matched to insure matching
parts. Due to the age of rods now I personally use NEW rods in all my
engines (SCAT I beam) not as pricey as H beam rods but consistent and
balanced end to end with matching pin heights.

Hi Jim,
A lightened FW is kind of like having a hammer made from styrofoam.  You can

move it up and down quite fast, but you will not have the mass in it to push

as much with it.  The stock wieght FW is a mass battery to keep the engine 
turning disspite the compression of the P&amp;Cs.  With a lightened FW you can 
RPM up the engine faster to shave off fractions of a second in a quater
mile, 
but it will not have enough mass to keep the engine turning over at idle and

low RPM.  Thusly these engines with lightened FW have to be revved up to
keep 
running when stopped at a light.  Also the stock wieght FW mass helps out to

smooth vibrations of the engine.
  As for the best source for a CW crank Gene Berg is best for quality, but
is 
a bit pricey.  We are trading for three brand new CW cranks from Butch in
San 
Diego at Bear VW Machine, but have no real info on these cranks except there

has been no problems so far with the engines Butch has put together with 
these crankshafts.  We were hoping to make it to Sacramento International 
Raceway, for the Memorial weekend VW meet at the end of this May.  Where we 
were going to connect up with Butch.  Unfortunitly it looks like we will not

make it there this time.  Is anybody from the PNW going who could bring us
up 
these crankshafts from there?
Thanks,   Eric&amp;Barb
