Subject: Re: [VB] Weatherstrip replacement

&gt; Anyone got a secret for
&gt; &gt; getting the windwing glass out of the frame
&gt; without damaging the frame?

&gt; To install, either build the device shown in the
&gt; Bentley manual, which
&gt; supports and pushs the glass back in, or get some
&gt; gooey soapy water or
&gt; silicone spray-on lubricant all over the new rubber,

What's always worked for me (so far) is to get a
&quot;Jorgensen&quot; clamp for woodworking.  (I used to be a
cabinetmaker and already had one.)  It's a clamp made
of two pieces of wood with two screw handles running
between them.  (See
http://store4.yimg_dot_com/I/toolsplus_1661_38140329 )

Just get the glass ready, and slowly tighten the clamp
to push the glass and rubber into the slot.
