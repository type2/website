&gt; I am taking my 67 21DLX and camping for a week on the playa, a (mostly)
&gt; dried, prehistoric lake bed. I will be traveling off road about five to
&gt; fifteen miles on the playa to camp site (could be thirty miles round trip
&gt; off road). A good number of vehicles will be attending, causing a lot of
&gt; this dust to be airborne. Also, dust storms occur from time to time.

Although &quot;playa&quot; is the correct technical term for this landform, most
folk call them &quot;dry lakes&quot;.
&gt;
&gt; Questions: (1) Would a paper air filter or stock oil bath filter be more
&gt; effective in this situation? (2) Round trip is 1,200 miles. Would the dusty
&gt; conditions require that I change the motor oil before making the trip home?
&gt; What would you do? I have no external motor oil filter system, running a
&gt; 1776. (3) Any tips or FYI on any preventive actions I could take to lessen
&gt; the dust contamination in my bus? When back home, I will give my bus a good
&gt; rinse, under, in and all around.

30 miles of dirt road are really nothing for a stock filter in good shape.
If travelling with other vehicles, don't ride in their dust clouds.
Alkali dust isn't all that bad for corrosion, as witnessed by the many
rust-free Nevada vehicles.

Remember that you are really getting off the beaten path in that region.
Never venture off alone unless you have reliable communications
capability.  Cellphones often don't work.  Best to travel with another
vehicle.  Most of Nevada is open range and it seems at night that all the
cattle are black.  Consider the effect of hitting a 2000 pound cow with
your 3000 pound bus before turning a wheel after dark.
