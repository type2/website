Subject: Re: [VB] What size radial tire ? - Cheap Conti's

Here's a cheap source for 185R14 Reinforced tires, which are good for all
one ton (big nut) splitties, all bays, and vanagons:

http://www.tirerack_dot_com/tires/index.jsp?autoYear=1979&amp;autoMake=Volkswagen

Go to the above link, use the vehicle model menu to go to 'Vanagon Camper',
and then click on the '185/-14' link.


There are some load range C and D reinforced tires on this page, starting
at only $45 (plus shipping) for a Continental!
