Subject: Re: [VB] Help with steering wheel

When I removed one a few months ago it was best for me to go ahead and undo
the steering box from the frame, that way you push the rod out, not pop the
wheel off.

Hope this helps you as it did me.

Meredith

&gt; I tried to remove my steering wheel all this weekend and i was unable to
do it.
