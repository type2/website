 Hi All,
 
 While at the vintage meet this past weekend in Seattle (I was there with the
 yellow 58 ghia vert since the double cab is still on jack stands...)  I
 realized that I am missing the little piece that is welded to the engine lid
 that the support bolts to.  I have the support and correct bolt.
 
 So, how can I reproduce this... or does anybody have a completely mangle
 engine lid that they could cut it from.  Or could someone supply me with
 dimensions and also where exactly to weld it to the lid.
 
 Thanks

it should be noticable on your engine lid, the side by the prop up area on 
the right, where the bit used to be.  generally you can see where two spot 
welds were torn off.  The bit that tacks on is slightly different than from a 
spring prop bus, but you could use one from a later bus and probably no one 
will notice, unless you are doing the ten point resto and are really 
concerned someone will point and laugh.   The important thing IMPO, is to use 
the right kind of bolt to attach the prop to the lid, as the bolt is made so 
the threads end and it won't tighten all the way down on the prop so it can 
still move easily.

I had my first splitty for 3 years- a 59 and didn't know they had props well 
this one didn't anymore at least so I kept a spare fan belt and a coat hanger 
in the side of the engine compartment and hooked the coat hanger stretched 
out to the rain gutter, other end to the fan belt, which looped around one of 
the screws that attached the liscence plate to the engine lid as it stuck out 
into the engine side of the lid.  worked for me.  ya, I guess the prop is 
nicer though.
