&gt;What do you think, Cristian?

I received several e-mails mentioning that this guy is not worth responding 
to. On the other hand, I got so many great comments from both the Vintage Bus 
list and WetWesties that it wouldn't take much effort to write a 
response...I'll send a brief but solid response e-mail to the newspaper.
Thanks everyone for you input.
