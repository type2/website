&lt;&lt;  Question #1-Should there be a seal under the nut that holds the oil 
filler to the alt. stand. Mine had one between the two; but not one on the 
inside.&gt;&gt;
Hi Chad,
Yes.

 &lt;&lt;Question #2-Any tips on replacing the seals on a doghouse cooler? I've
 never had one off and I think this is where alot of the oil is coming from.&gt;&gt;
Remove fan shroud.  Remove cooler and base from the engine case.  Remove the 
cooler from it's base.  Install new seals between the base and cooler and 
between the base and engine case.  Make sure to note the seals and/or the 
passage holes fromt eh engine case to the cooler base.  These seals can vary 
due to the passage holes in the engine case.

&lt;&lt;Question #3-Where is the best place to buy a fuel sending unit from (12v.)? 
&gt;&gt;
It depends on what year bus fuel tank you are using.  Eric&amp;Barb
