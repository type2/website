&lt;&lt; So the replacing of the front wheel bearings went pretty well, they were
 all discoloured and a couple were pitted really badly, tho now I seem to
 notice more sloppyness in the steering. &gt;&gt;
Hi Jdd,
Check the front bearing lock nut/s adjustment after the first 30-50 miles of
driving to make sure that things have not seated and thusly loosened.

&lt;&lt; I topped it up last fall with 80-90w and I read somewhere only 90w should
be used?&gt;&gt;
Either will work, just top off every 6,000 miles or 6 months which ever comes
first.  Then drain and refill with new oil when you first get a bus and every
five years or so there after.

&lt;&lt;I'm wondering about my rear bearings.  I was told they should be repacked
and I do notice a &quot;howl&quot; sound from back there.&gt;&gt;
Okay, you repack the front bearings in new grease the rear wheel bearings are
bathed in the tranny oil.  Matter of fact if you get a small leak at on of
the reductions the oil from the tranny moves downhill to keep these bearings
lubed as long as possible.

&lt;&lt;So I should just go in as far as the first set of bearings in the rear,
right?  No need for me to go near the reduction boxes, right? *gulp* Other
than to check fluid levels, right?  Do I need a puller of some sort to get
the ball bearing out?&gt;&gt;
First have you replace the tranny and reduction oil since you got your bus?
Plus checked the tranny oil level every 6,000 miles or 6 months?  If not
drain the tranny center section and then each of the reductions.  You will
need to block the front tires, jack up the rear, and remove the rear tires.
While the bus is in the air and before you remove the rear tires give each a
pull with one hand on one side of the tire while the other hand pushes and
then reverse the pull/push action.  Do this top and bottom of the tire and
front and rear of the rear tires.  If you get more than a 1/32&quot; movement at
the tip of the axle it probably means time to replace all four bearings on
that side.  Also when you drain the oil out of each of the reductions into a
clean drain pan look for pieces of steel in the dregs of this drained oil.
If you find more than three or four pieces bigger than a pin head you might
want to dissassemble that reduction box, check and/or replace some to all of
them on that side.

&lt;&lt;So should a bearing be replaced if it shows any discolouration at all, or
is very minor discolouration and a very small pit or two, OK?  I guess I know
the answer to that.&gt;&gt;
If a wheel stops turning suddenly, falls off or the steering locks up while
you are at highway speeds what do you think you and your bus going to do?  Do
yourself a favor and get the Bentley reprint of the pre-1968 bus VW shop
manual ASAP so you can do this work properly!       Eric&amp;Barb
