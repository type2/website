&lt;&lt; This is a general question about daily driving.  
 
 I have recently acquired (as you know by now) a 1966 Standard Microbus 
 outfitted with a 67 tranny and 71 dual port beetle engine.  I am currently 
 using a 1970 Westy as a daily driver.  I mean EVERY day and EVERYWHERE from 
 20 miles a day to 200 miles a day.  It is a beater and leaks oil like a 
sieve 
 but gets me everywhere I need to go and with regular maintenance with 
brakes, 
 bearings and struts has never let me down.  Now, can I expect the same 
 results from my 66?  I hear about people replacing the standard trannys with 
 later models for better freeway use.  Is this necessary?  Can I expect the 
67 
 tranny to have a reasonable lifespan with highway driving?  Can it handle 
 speeds of 60-65 MPH for long periods of time?  I would like to scale my 
 collection down to one bus (for economical reasons mostly) but don't want to 
 stifle my wandering spirit.  Do other early sixties bus owners drive their 
 buses daily?  Do you put tons of mileage on them and are they stock or did 
 you modify?  I like stock but I prefer functionality.      
  &gt;&gt;
yes you can drive a splitty daily.  I'd say you have a later or mid sixties 
rather than early 60s bus. for your 66 I would not make any major mods, just 
make sure you have good brakes a,d steeing and a good motor.   I put a 3.88 
r&amp;p tranny in my 65 westy, and I am not so sure I like it, don't know that it 
does that much for me, cause the flat speed is good, but it doesn't like the 
hills as much.  So the 67 tranny is probably a 4.12 r&amp;p with hopefull .82 4th 
and 1.26 RG boxes.  which is probably the best.   But the only way to know 
for sure your rpms is get a tach on it.   ANyway, yes a splitty with regular 
maintenacnce will get you where you need to go.  sounds like you know how to 
take care of a bus, I like to drive around locally a bit before doing major 
distances, if I am unsure of the buses reliability, just to work the kinks 
out.
