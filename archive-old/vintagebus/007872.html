Subject: Idea for reinstalling torsion leaves.

I know it's gonna be tough when I go to reinstall the torsion leaves back
into the beam on this 67 bus.  In an effort to try to think ahead, I was
wondering if I couldn't make a tool that would ease the installation of the
springs.  It would consist of the center section of a beam (the part that
holds the springs in their shape) and in turn, this would be welded to a
pipe which would be long enough to stick out past the end of the axle tube a
few inches.  You would insert your torsions into the pipe and then insert
the whole appartus down into the axle beam.  Once the torsions slid out of
the pipe and into their holding collar on the inside of the beam, you could
pull the tool out of the beam.  If this sounds feasible, I may have to find
someone who has a wrecked type 2 beam and have them hack saw the middle
section out of the beam for me.

Any other ideas for this procedure?

BTW:  Today so far I've cleaned the front brake drums and had them turned.
They both cleaned up with 2 turns each - not bad for $12.   I'm headed back
to the shop right now to finish cleaning the bearings in the beam (3 of them
so far look to be in really good shape) and will take the beam for blasting
tomorrow after prepping.  Later...
