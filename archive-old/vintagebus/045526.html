Seems like Clara hit on most everything.  A few more minutia details, feel
free to nail me if I'm wrong:

Pop-Outs - Pre 1963 Double Cabs had the horizontal style mount on the   window
frame with dark brown/black latch *knobs*.

Front Seats - Bench Style until '64 I think, although '62 was a one year only
adjustable bench seat.  Then 1/3, 2/3 split seat with adjustable driver's
seat.

Engine Lid - Church key thru '65, then push button latch.  Spring style hold
open came out in late '64 or early '65.

I was just answering the questions he had (tranny, wiring, etc.), not trying
to be all encompassing.   Maybe I should write a book.

FWIW, the1/3 2/3 front seat appearing in June or July of 62, the elbow engine
lid stay was replaced by the spring in Dec 63, at the same time the cab doors
got push button handles,   The early DC pop out frames are the same as to
early 54 (don't know spec. date) on barndoors, but the latch is styled
different, though interchangable.  Not sure of the date when that was used
till.  

 BTW, I have one really nice early style pop out frame, with the horizontal
screw on for the latch, for sale, pmail me if interested.   From an early 54
barndoor, dove blue.   May have a DC latch, but not sure where it went.
