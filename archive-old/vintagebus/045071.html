Just to note, my '66 westy has the sticker to the left of the
steering column that says &quot;12 volt&quot; with the lightening bolt.  Of
course Ive seen these as reproduction, but knowing some of the
history of this bus, I believe this '66 was  a 12v  from birth.  Was
this an option, or did they get an early start with mine?  Maybe I
have the very first 12v bus in the world.  Talk about &quot;rare&quot; ;)
 ---------------------
I think it was available in 63 to get 12V, there is an m code (620 off the 
top of my head, though I don't know what 12V is doing there... oh it's 
lighting up that bulb)  I believe a listmember has a 65 original 12V bus.

And Martin P from elsewhere than N America evidently, wrote:

As you can see in my mail I am talking about 12 V as STANDARD EQUIPMENT.

It also was a common option in earlier years.

It became widely spread in about 1961, but 12 V were available upon
special request even earlier (without M code).

many things that were common to the N Am VWs were not so to others, and vice 
versa.  I only learned about 70s bug being available 6V a couple years ago, 
and was quite surprised.   I had a stock set up for putting a upright motor 
in a 72-79 bus FS at the last Puyallup meet, and people were oohing over it.  
 I didn't think it was THAT big a deal.   Sliding door splits are very 
unusual here.    Those steering locks were seemingly standard on euro splits, 
very rare here.  BTW I am still looking for a steering lock (have the 
column).  Any help out there?    BTW, I wrote that question (6V in 67 bug?) 
as a quiz.  Maybe I'll do more dumb quiz stuff.  Maybe not.  I keep missing 
the Fridays for posting Friday stuff.
