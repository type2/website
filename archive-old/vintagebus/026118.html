Subject: Value of '65 tranny?

Hi Volks,

subject says it all... a pal has a '65 tranny, another one wants it, 
and none of us has an idea what it might be worth.  Any ideas?  
Condition unknown, presumed working.  Estimates from a European 
(German) standpoint would be particularly helpful, but any 
guesstimate is better than nothing.  Also, is a '60 tranny worth more 
or less than the '65?

Yours,
    Erik.
