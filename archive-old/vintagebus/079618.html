Hi Thom,

I contacted you about two weeks back in regards to the first year Westfalia Campers were produced.  You kindly replied, thanks...

I am on assignment for the LA Times Outdoor Section and am writing an article on Westfalias and their owners. We are looking for owners that do the &quot;extreme&quot; in their buses and related in some way to the outdoors whether it be biking, climbing, skiing, surfing etc.  I especially want people who outfit their vehicles to suit their particular area of interest. I would especially like to have an example of a vintage bus that is taken to the extremes just to demonstrate the longevity and usefulness of these &quot;little bulls.&quot;  Any help you can provide, whether through personal contacts or getting the word out will be extremely helpful.

Thank you,
Margaret Aston
