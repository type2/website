&lt;&lt; &quot;second point i would be willing to bet thtat the original insulation is 
asbestos containing (i.e. carcinogenic)- don't want to breathing that stuff 
in&quot; &gt;&gt;

Hi Volks,
So far we have never seen asbestos used in this area!  It is fiberglass cloth 
which you can get at almost any hardware store in the fiber glass repair 
isle.  Asbestos is much more grayish and has no sheen when in wolven form.  
The little flat seals used around the heat riser tubes in fresh air engines 
are asbestos.  There are rings of asbestos just inside the ends of the 62 and 
later model type 1s and could be in the post 67 bus plastic heater to body 
tube ends.   Eric&amp;Barb
