Subject: Re: [VB] Oil cooler leak?

I looked at the pictures, and it made me wince.  The last time I had an oil
leak like this (you might want to sit down for this) it was the actual case
that was cracked.  I went through 3 oil coolers, 2 mechanics, and about 8
sets of engine gaskets sets, and then I finally found the problem on my own.
It was a hair line crack from the front oil passage (front being the pully
end of the case) to the front of the oil pedestal.  Basiclly what I'm trying
to say is, it was cracked under the oil cooler mount, on the case, in the
front oil passage.  I could not see the crack while the engine sat cold. I
finally got aggravated, and ran the engine with no cooling tins at all to
see where it was at. VIOLA!!! It started bleeding profusely.  Thank god it
was a pretty new rebuild, and my mechanic only charged me $200 to completely
rebuild it with another case (which I found).

If this ends up being your problem let us know.
