Subject: VW Newsletter Editors

Folks,

I am trying to compile a list of  e-mail addresses for those folks 
responsible for the many awesome VW newsletters I have come across.  As my 
club, the Buskatiers, has decided to avoid the newsletter bit, it was 
suggested that show reports and other interesting stories might be sent to 
editors of other newsletters.  Everyone I know who currently edits a 
newsletter is always looking for information and articles to fill pages and 
this seems to be a great way to network information.

If you care to add your name to this list, please send me a p-mail to that 
effect.  I don't imagine sending things out more than once a month and I 
will not share your email address with ANYONE.  I currently write a monthly 
column for the Mo-Kan VW club and would probably send it out along with 
anything else that might be of interest.  I am also hoping to add the e-mail 
address of members of the editorial staff from the VW magazines.

Let me know if you are interested.

I wake up every morning determined both to change the world and have one
hell of a good time.  Sometimes this makes planning the day a little
difficult.
