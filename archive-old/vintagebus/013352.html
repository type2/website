Hello List Folk!

Last year, we went on our summer road trip and then put a trip report
on the lists.  Some folks who actually read the trip report sent me
pmails, many of which said something like:

-----------------
George, you drove right by my town!  Why didn't you stop off at my
place, eat my food, drink my beer, and completely rebuild your bus in
my driveway? ...
-----------------

To prevent this disappointing situation from happening on our July
trip we decided to give you all some fair warning.  If you live in the
states mentioned in the subject line, and if you would like to visit,
drop me a pmail and we'll see if we can make a contact!

BTW, we are self-sufficient.  We aren't looking to sponge off of
anyone, just to meet some interesting listfolk!

George Lyle

P.S.  If you can give us a good reason (or even a bad one!) we might
deviate from our rough flight plan and visit states not named above!
