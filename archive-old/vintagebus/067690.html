&gt;    Well this is to let everyone know that BBB was a great success, not only
&gt; for all the people that came and had a good time, but for the 2 kids
&gt; organizations that we help.
&gt;    After all is said and done we are able to donate $6000.00 dollars (up
&gt; from $3000.00 last year) to Arizona Childrens Foundation and $1000.00
&gt; dollars to Child Enrichment Fund (a local non profit charity for kids).
&gt;    This brings this years total donations to $7000.00

Hot Dang!  That's a pile o' bux!

That's a great job by Ronnie and the London Bridge Bullis!

The effort that goes into producing a quality event like BBB is
unimaginable, but these guys produce a better show every year.  This year
brought a great site with real grass and a nice beach.  A choice of
camping spots ranging from &quot;back in the bushes&quot; to &quot;luxury cabana with
built-in barbeque&quot; met just about everyone's desires.  The raffles were
great, with lots of good VW stuff.  All through this the LBB folks were
right there working hard to keep things running smoothly.  Even the
glitches, like the bozo who decided to personalize the bathroom, were
handled seamlessly.

Again, thanks to Ronnie, John, and the crew for putting up with hundreds
of crazed bus fanatics and somehow maintaining their sanity!
