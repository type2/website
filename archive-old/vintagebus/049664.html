&gt;&gt; You will not find teflon tape on any aicraft engines in the oil system, to

&gt;&gt; BTW, I think Berg mentions this, also.





&gt;OK then...what to use??
&gt;swharris

nothing, sadly...the threads are supposed to be an interference fit;
tighten hand tight = no leaks. in theory :)

try and hand-tighten it a bit after every run and see if that at least
keeps it to a minimum; i have a big oilpressure sender can in there, and it
does tend to work loose now and again. tho most of ITS leaks are from the
can itself!

mebbe a small dab of gasgacinch on the TOP (sender) end of the threads
might help?

also, there are METRIC and STANDARD threaded senders!  metric senders are
tapered  ( &gt;), standard are square ( ] ). i  have heard that the t4 case is
a square thread, too. the standard ones seem to go farther into the case  -
perhaps this is why some folks report that the sender is closer to the
case on their bus?  square ones  seem to leak a bit more often.

i have a weep here, too; either the boss has (invisibly) cracked, or the
sender can just wiggles around too much to seal for very long.
