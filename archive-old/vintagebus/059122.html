Subject: Re: [VB] Trailer Wiring Question

Had the symptom of wacky blinkers with lights on when one of my filaments
sagged into the other one.  Might want to check that there isn't a short
between the running and brake/turn lights on that side.  My symptoms were
that it worked fine without lights on, but was goofy with lights on.  As
Matt mentioned could be extra load on the flasher too.
