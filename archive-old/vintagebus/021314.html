&lt;&lt; Did the seat get its hump from the stuffing of from that actual frame?  My 
seat has been reupholstered sometime in it's life and no longer sports the 
hump.  Any clues here for me? &gt;&gt;
Hi Matthew,
The hump is formed by differant length springs and wire braces.  So one just 
has to look into the back of the upper seat section to see the hump 
spring/frame setup.
