  I did refill the reduct box after replacing the seal but did not top off 
the tranny.
Hi Rob,
ALWAYS refill the tranny center section anytime you open or drain the RGBs!!! 
 Otherwise about 1/3 - 1/2 of the tranny center section drains down the 
tranny axle tube.  This is set up this way to help the RGB from going dry longer if 
a leak happens.  Giving the VW bus owner longer to find the leak before 
something catastrophic happens.
  Does sound like E-brake lever in the drum is rubbing against the drum.  
Take drum off and look for shiney metal rub area on the E-brake cable end and 
corresponding mark inside the drum.
