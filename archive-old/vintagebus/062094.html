Subject: RE: [VB] Full fow oil pump?

Ah ha:
http://www.cbperformance_dot_com/catalog.asp?ProductID=194

I imagine it is similar to this then.  An &quot;all-in-one&quot; full flow kit.

&gt;Since both inlets on the cover are blocked-off, I suppose its just acting
like a standard pump, right? If so, any drawbacks to just leaving it as it
is?&lt;

Yup, that is fine.  The Maxi pumps are not a true full flow setup at all,
but better than nothing if used with an external filter.  Once the tubes are
blocked off it will act like a standard oil pump.     


Good Luck,
Adrian

&gt; I think someone installed the cover incorrectly.  Twist that bad boy
around
&gt; 90 degrees pointing left.

I looked again and there are two outlets/inlets on the cover. One is
positioned a 9 o'clock and
another is at about 4 or 5 o'clock. Both have a steel tube attached that is
cut-off and bent over to
seal it.
