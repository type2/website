Subject: Bus stereo question...

Hi all,

Recently there has been discussion about larger stereo systems being used on
stock Bus electrical systems and problems and solutions.  &quot;Caps&quot; (whatever
they are) were mentioned as a way of eliminating drop outs , etc.

I have a 15 year old or so AM/FM/cassette stereo in the dash of my '67 Westy
(I'm guessing about 10 watts per side?).  It runs through an equally old Radio
Shack brand 40 watt equalizer/power amp and out to 4 fairly unremarkable car
stereo speakers (two in the front doors and two in the rear of the Bus).
Sounds great when I don't crank it up to high, but as I increase the volume
toward loud, the volume occasionally pulses or drops temporarily.  The louder
you go the more frequent the &quot;drop-out&quot; of volume.  I assumed it was maybe
drawing too much power at that point.  Does that simple description sound
right/familiar to you audio experts?  If so, could you comment on a solution
(those &quot;caps&quot;, etc.) in plain English for us audio rookies?  You know, what
they are, what they do, where to get 'em, how to install them properly, how to
obtain a wiring diagram of how they should be installed, etc.?  Us &quot;rookies'
would sure appreciate your guidance!

Thanks again,

Bill Bowman
