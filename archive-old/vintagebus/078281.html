Subject: Re: [VB] 12V generator bearings anyone???

Yeah, I've gotta do the tests that you've well-outlined here, but I need a
break in this wet rainy weather first! Sheezz! you'd think it was the
rainy season here in the Bay Area!  No garage here to work in (I&quot;m not
rich anymore :-( ).

It hasn't gotten so bad that it sounds immenently threatening, just the
occassional roar on starting, and a smooth whistle at speed. I was gonna
let it go til the rainy season stopped, but a siezed genny is the end of
the road if you're more than a block from your driveway. Fortunately a bus
goes by the house all the way to my work.

&gt;  start engine up to see if the whine went away with the fan belt
&gt; disconnected.   ( It's okay to just start it up for a minute).  If the noise if gone, it
&gt; probably came from the gen.  Turn engine off.  Reattach belt and start it up
&gt; again.  Is the noise back?
