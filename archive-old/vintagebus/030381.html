Subject: Re: [VB] 12V sys. &amp; 6V flasher

The guy that owned my bus before me ran the 6v flasher for 2 years with
twelve volts running through it, then the bus sat for 14 years, and I
ran it on the same 6v flasher with twelve volts for almost a year before
it finally gave up and stopped flashing( then I ran it for another month
manually flashing it with the lever) before I found a twelve volt one
for about two bucks sitting under about an inch of dust on a freinds
parts counter. There really isn't much difference in how the 12v flashes
at all.
