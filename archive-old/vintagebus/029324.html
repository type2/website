Hey all...
On my trip to Missouri this past weekend, I averaged about 21mpg there
and back (even with that nasty headwind on the way back, and a full
length roof rack)   I had all my gear, my buddie's gear, and some other
stuff I picked up at buses...and him in the bus for the trip back.  Half
of the trip down I had 3 people in the bus (including myself) and all of
our gear... and it still came out around 21 mpg...
I run a 1500 single port motor with the original small nut tranny in the
62.  I drive about 60mph usually (55 sometimes) and go easy on the
gas... I accelerate before hills...and let off a little before the
hill...and just keep a steady foot all the way up the hill...not
flooring it.  A steady foot is good to have...as if you work the pedal a
lot...that accelerator pump is pumping a lot of extra gas into your
motor.  Don't forget about that one...  I run stock exhaust and a
30PICT-2 carb and I love the setup.  I even have a 009 dizzy on it.  I
didn't build or tune the motor...it was like that when i got it...and I
drove it home like that.  (hey...if it runs good... don't touch it!)
I've checked my valves a few times...and they haven't needed adjustment
yet in the 6K I've put on so far....  I've even seen 27mpg in my bus on
a nice non windy day...without a lot of crap stuck in it....  I bet I
could get 30 if I had a nice tailwind.....but that never happens.

fwiw...
