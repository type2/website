Subject: Re: [Large Screw Update]
Mime-Version: 1.0

while we are on the 'screw' thread...

has anyone ever found a source for *correct* screws that are used to attach wood slats on ~1965 westy racks. I have found some close approximates but not that are bang on.

If memory serves these are ~1.5&quot; long phillips screws w/ counter sunk style of head that if you looked at the screw from the side would have a roud &quot; ^ &quot; (&lt;-- supposed be be round but cannot fid ASCII character close enough) style head..

i know that this is a shot in dark but would ask..

also does scott care to post that # for where he got the screws.. and is there an on-line resource for back tracking DIN's to somehting a service counter type would understand?

michael
