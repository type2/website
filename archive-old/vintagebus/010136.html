Subject: URL for Westy Bay to Splitwindow conversion...

A while back I stumbled across a page where someone successfully
transplanted a late window westy camper interior into a splitty.  Does
anyone know what the URL for this page is?  As I recall, the ZBed fit okay
but the closet needed to be shortened up about 3 inches.  The reason I want
to know about this is I have access to 2 westy interiors for cheap and want
to know just what is involved in making them fit.

Later!
