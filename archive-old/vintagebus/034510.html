&lt;&lt; &gt; I guess I wanted to chime in here with my $.02 on yet another supplier -
 &gt; Oregon Performance Products.
 &gt; 
 I too have spoken with the &quot;sphincter&quot;  at oregon performance.  Not a nice
 guy.  Looks like a great conversion but should I decide to underrtake it
 there will be no parts from them.  My brother works in RMMW's wholesale
 division and tried to bring them on a year or so ago same results.  Oh well
 word always gets around one way or other.  HMMMM. &gt;&gt;

It is funny you should mention RMMW.  I brought up to OPP that if he wanted to
be successful in business he needed to change his approach.  He said he *was*
successful.  Told him Chris Nowak of RMMW going from a business operated out
of a garage to a huge national mail order mega-business in a few short years
was successful, OPP was not.  

RMMW is a bit more expensive than most every other supplier out there but they
have great service and always have the part in stock (in my experience)  Good
service is why they are so successful.  I find it surprising more suppliers
don't take notice of that.
