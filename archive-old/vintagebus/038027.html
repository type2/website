 can start puffing. When it's hot out, the metal on the dash gets a little
 mushy. Safari's aren't so much just a neat accessory. They would work even
 better if you had an NOS windshield squirter to give yourself a little mist
 every now and then. 8^) Gotta get me one of those...

that's a cool idea- using the windsheild squirteer to mist yourself with the 
windsheilds open.   I have a squirt bottle though :)
