911 Porsche or even better a 64 356 Carrera Porsche, or even better a 
Sea-Trab oil cooler. ALL of these have the same fin placement as the tight 
finned type 3 oil cooler. They are also useing these to cool WITHOUT forced 
air, Think about it. The cars (engines) that use these types of coolers have 
more money in a couple of parts in there engines then our whole upright 
engine would cost new!  &gt;&gt;

Hi Ronnie,
Interesting to hear!  How do they get the cooling air through the cooler 
without forced air?  Maybe the tighter fins work better with the Porsche 
non-forced air cooling of the cooler and not as well with the VW forced air 
system?  We know a good bit about the late 50s early 60s 356s, but not later 
Porsches.  Porsche relied also on much more and bigger fins on the heads and 
cylinders where most of the heat is created.  Perhaps this allowed Porsche to 
use a smaller cooler?  Interestingly VW came out a year before Porsche did 
with the IRS suspension!  Yes, the lowly inexpensive bug and Ghia suddenly 
handled better than that year expensive Porsche!

 &lt;&lt;This is an argument that can go on forever, but we should have real 
numbers in the next couple weeks as there are now 4 people here in 110 degree 
Havasu with or in the process of using the tight finned type 3 cooler. &gt;&gt;

We would not call all this an argument, just a disscussion.  There have been 
many a time we thought of trying something, but at second, third or fourth 
time talking about it with other VW nuts like us and reading manual after 
manual we would figured/found out why it was not such a good idea.  Testing 
with gauges is the ultimate for figuring out which parts and methods work 
best and we have done so several times.  IE blocking off the fresh air tubes 
to the heat exchangers is a bad idea!   We look forward to seeing how your 
testing goes.  Would be great if you were to try the the type 4 cooler on the 
same engines for more testing.
