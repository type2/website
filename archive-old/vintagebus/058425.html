Subject: RE: [VB] Pedal Pan 

Since there is talk of pedal pans, where can I snag one for my 67 SC ?

Good question as I am missing a few myself.  Now here's another question:
On my '65 Single Cab all the front screws are Phillips and the rest are flat
blade type.  The two won't interchange either.  Is this normal?  I was
thinking that maybe VW used the Phillips head sheet metal screws at the
front to aid in removal.

size they are? I tried the fanshoud screws but they do
not work. TIA!
