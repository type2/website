   I will have some of Chriss' &quot;The Steering Wheel Man&quot; new steering wheels
with me at Red Barn and KP?. Come by and have a look, will have Black and
Ivory? ones there to feel, touch and look at, will have the info to order
from him  with me also. If anyone is interested in picking one up there let
me know and I can bring them with me.
