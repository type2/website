I used to have to be certified for use of breathing apparatus in sewers.
Maybe once or twice a year I would have to go down, and for such rare usage
it was considered adequate to seal the mask around the edges with Vaselene
petroleum jelly. Now if I was a fireman I would have had to be beardless,
but for occasional use you can get by. Assuming you're not a member of ZZ
Top  that is.
