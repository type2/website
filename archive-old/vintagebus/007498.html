My 2 cents.

Clean the threads real well before putting the engine into
place, also clean out the threads of the nuts. Put engine in
place. Push the bolt through the hole. Place washer onto
bolt.  Hold the nut between forefinger and thumb. Place
middle finger against bolt threads while starting nut. Once
nut is started, it will go on just fine if you put a little
side pressure on it while spinning it down. Tighten with
torque wrench or calibrated arm.  Can do this with my eyes
shut.  Got to , can't see around the fan housing anyway.

&gt; is it really nessecary to put in the driver side bolt?
&gt;
&gt; ive had 10 vws , and ive never even seen that bolt, even
though every one of
&gt; them had the hoover bit,
&gt;  on the starter side you just stick the bolt in from the
starter side with a
&gt; wrench on it so it doesnt turn , then go around back and
start the nut on
&gt; with your thumb and forefinger while pulling the bolt
through with the
&gt; fingernail on your middle finger.  If the bolt and nut are
clean with a shot
&gt; of wd40 you can usually spin it on easily to the point
where it grabs and
&gt; you can tighten it down.  Takes a little practice.

&gt; &gt; I was surprised again yesterday by how hard it is to get
the nuts on the
&gt; &gt; upper engine bolts in a Type 2.  In fact, I'm still at
it this morning.  I
&gt; &gt; think if I can jam a socket and extension in front of
the driver's side
&gt; bolt,
&gt; &gt; I may be able to wiggle the nut down past the doghouse
shroud and get the
&gt; &gt; damned thing started.  I'm still not sure what I'll do
to secure the
&gt; &gt; right-side bolt.  Anyone have any real good ideas on
this subject?
