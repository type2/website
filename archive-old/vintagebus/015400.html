&gt; Could you please explain the California YOM(which i think means year of
&gt; manufacture) regulations.

On *California* plates:

California DMV will let you &quot;retrofit&quot; license palces for vehicles that
are 1962 and older.  These are also known as &quot;YOM&quot; or &quot;year of manufactore&quot; 
plates, which relate to the specific set of rules for using old plates on 
older cars. 

There are several different styles of California plates:

&quot;51&quot; plates are black with yellow letters, and are wider and shorter than today's plates; registration tab was a metal piece which went over the lower right corner of the plate
&quot;56&quot; plates are yellow with black letters, modern size, no reg sticker for '56 year, adhesive sticker in the right upper corner 1957 and later
&quot;63&quot; plates are black with yellow letters, modern size, adhesive reg stickers

On &quot;63&quot; plates, you can only use them if they are already assigned to the the car.
DMV has changed the rules, and you can't use YOM plates for this vintage any more.
These are the black plates with yellow letters.  If you have them on your car, 
I suggest you keep them.  You can't go back and forth.

On &quot;51&quot; plates and &quot;56&quot; plates, you can get the plates assigned to your car *if*
* You have *both* plates
* They are in good condition
* the Year sticker matches the year of the car 
  - ie; if you have a '58 car, you have to have the 1958 sticker.  If you
    don't have the sticker, you can sometimes buy them from license plate
    dealers.  DMV does not have them and they are not repro'd.  The stickers
    will run $30-$60.  They are painstakingly peeled from old plates.
  - '51 plates used a small metal tag stamped with the year, which goes
    over the right lower corner. These tabs will run ~$25 or so.  Same rules
    apply as for stickers.
* the current registration sticker goes on a small metal tab which DMV provides
(note: license plate vendors sell them for $10; DMV gives them away free) and 
is affixed to one of the mouting screwes/bolts for the plate.
