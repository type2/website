I guess I don't understand what you mean about &quot;lower nose repair piece&quot; -
there are two different pieces - the inner and outer.  Alan's inner is a
zillion pieces of metal; the WW one is a single assembly made of several
sections welded for you.  I liked the WW one better.  The only flaw with
the WW one was a gap on both sides of ~3/4&quot;, due to the piece &quot;bowing&quot; too
much and not meeting up with the lower *outer* piece perfectly.

As far as the &quot;V&quot; section, I used a piece from another bus.

&gt;I started this metal thread. I was just wondering, does the
&gt;WW lower nose repair piece replicate the original VW

&gt;front of my bus now that I have it cut off and I don't
&gt;really like the Schofield piece.

&gt;The original upper nose sheet (with V) overlapped, by about
&gt;two inches, the sheet behind the bumper. Upper nose sheet
&gt;had a 1/2&quot; flange at the bottom with another piece
&gt;bent/crimped around it that also extended down about a 1/2&quot;
&gt;and was spot welded to the sheet behind the bumper.
