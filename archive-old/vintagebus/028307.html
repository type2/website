 Also, on that note...  I've been looking for

Well, since you asked....
I would love to have everything from the pre-68 vw parts microfiche
scanned and searchable on the web. 
Maybe also the vw tool local manufacture book on-line.
I have many of the microfiche, but last time I looked I could not find
my split microfiche.
