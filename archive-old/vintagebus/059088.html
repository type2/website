Subject: Re: [VB] didn't do so hot with kelly park

Since Thom blew up a pulley last year (enroute to KP maybe?) and posted pics I
have been carrying a spare. Didn't help me when the generator siezed up and
wouldn't spin though. And since Ronnie lost a rocker not long ago I have been
thinking I should carry those as well, but haven't yet.
I do carry:
shift coupler, bunch of brake parts, carb, dizzy, plugs and wires, lamps, fuel
pump and parts, lotsa seals and gaskets and cables, throwout bearing, shift
fork, expandable pushrod tube, and a good assortment of useful hardware and
small parts. I'd like to add some bearings to my kit but  haven't yet. I carry a
spare vent window glass now because I lost one to flying gravel on a dirt road
once and it sucked to be without it. If I had spare heads I might bring those,
too. But taking a second engine? Maybe if I was on that cape-to-cairo trip, but
otherwise no. If I lost a rod or such on a trip I might change my tune...

&gt; Trip home kinda blew, about 10 miles north of King City (260 miles from
&gt; home) I had the front inner generator pully come apart, no spare. =(
&gt; Do people carry spare pullies? I would never have thought for this to
&gt; happen.
