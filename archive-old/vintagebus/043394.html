&gt;
&gt;I am trying to figure out a cheap way to make my rear turn signal lamps
&gt;work.  I do not have the proper relay in this '67 bus.  In fact, there
&gt;is NO relay for the rear turn signal lights.  The front turn signals
&gt;work, but the relay is a non-standard (for a VW) generic turn signal
&gt;relay.  I plan to build a circuit using off the shelf relays to drive
&gt;the rear signals.

I'm with you so far.  Probably the generic turn signal flasher is
a two-terminal type, connected across the black with white and
green stripe wire and the solid black wire where the 9-prong box
used to be.  (If the turn signals work even with the key off,
then it's probably connected to the solid red wire instead of
the solid black one).

&gt;If I understand correctly, the break light and the turn signal light
&gt;is the same bulb with two filaments.  Is that correct?  I think that
&gt;the break light function is totally independent of the turn signal/tail
&gt;light function.  Correct???

Yes, the bulb has two filaments.  No, the brake light function is NOT
independent of the turn signal and tail function.  The grouping is
(brake and turn) and (tail).  There is a dim and a bright filament.
The dim filament is the tail-light.  It is wired to the tail-light
position on the headlight switch.  Basically, it's a simple on-off
switch that's on whenever the headlight switch is pulled out at all.

The bright filament is the turn signal and brake light filament.
All the magic for this happens in the turn signal switch.  The
right rear and left rear bright filaments each have their own
section of the turn signal switch.  With the turn signal off
(lever in the middle), both filaments are connected to the wire
from the brake light switch - when you step on the brakes, both
bulbs light up.

When you turn left, the left filament is connected to the turn
signal flasher so it blinks, but the right filament is still
connected to the wire from the brake light switch.  If you step
on the brake, the right side will light up steadily.
 
When you turn right, the right filament is connected to the turn
signal flasher so it blinks, but the left filament is still
connected to the wire from the brake light switch.  If you step
on the brake, the left side will light up steadily.

I am going to disregard the hazard flasher function for now.
I am also assuming that your brake lights do work now.

First, turn the tail lights on and go to the back of the Bus.  
Make sure the &quot;dim&quot; filament in each bulb is on.  Have someone
step on the brake, and make sure the &quot;bright&quot; filament comes
on...it should totally swamp out the &quot;dim&quot; filament.  If you
get no light whatsoever, make sure the bulb isn't burned out
(either filament).  If the &quot;bright&quot; and &quot;dim&quot; seem to be
backwards, first try removing the bulb, rotating it 180
degrees, and re-installing.  If that's not possible, interchange
the two wires on the socket.  Also make sure the tail-light
housing is well grounded.  When you're happy with how it
works, shut off the lights and go up to the dash.

Here's a little run down of all the wires at the 9-prong box.  
You should still have all these wires, but some of them won't
have anything plugged into them.

15   black              hot with key on
30   red                hot at all times
KBl  blue/white         speedo turn signal indicator
54   black/red          input from brake light switch
VR   black/green        right front turn signal wire
VL   black/white        left front turn signal wire
49a  black/green/white  turn signal pulses to turn signal switch
54f  red/purple         brake light output to turn signal switch
-S   brown              hazard switch input

First thing: Put some tape around the following wires individually,
as you won't need them: VR, VL, -S, and 15.  Don't tape any of
these together, just insulate them from one another and from
touching anything else.

Next: Connect 54 and 54f together.  Use a short piece of wire with
male tab terminals crimped on each end.  If your brake lights have
been working, this connection has probably already been made.
If your brake lights have been working but there's no connection
here, trace 54 (black/red) back to find out where the PO spliced
from it to either 54f (red/purple) or HR and HL (black/purple and
black/yellow), the rear tail-light wires.  If you can find no
such splices, let me know, but something on these circuits will
have to be spliced together if you have brake lights now.  If
you find PO (not factory) splices, remove them, and wrap any exposed
wires with tape.  When you get done, 54f (black/purple) should run
from where the 9-prong box used to be, straight into the turn
signal switch.  At the turn signal switch, there should be three 
black/white stripe wires coming out.  The two with factory
splices/connectors on them are the rear light wires.  One will
be spliced to a black/purple wire (HR - rear right) and the other
will be spliced to a black/yellow wire (HL - rear left).  (There
will be more wires at the turn signal switch that I haven't
mentioned, but we don't care about them yet.)

At this point, your brake lights should work whenever you step on
the brakes with the key on.

Next: Connect the &quot;X&quot; terminal of your generic turn signal flasher
to 30.  Connect the &quot;L&quot; terminal to 49a and KBl.  If you front turn 
signals are working, it's very likely that these connections have
already been made (or at least the 30 and 49a connections).

At this point, your front and rear turn signals should work.
If just the front ones work, let me know, but if you have the
brake lights working properly as above, then both the front
and rear should work.

Also, the indicator light in the speedometer should flash -
it will probably be on when the turn signals are off and vice
versa.

Have your friend signal a left turn and step on the brake (key
on).  The left rear turn signal should flash and the right one
should be on steady.  When they let off the brake, the left
one should keep flashing and the right one should go out.

Have your friend signal a right turn and step on the brake (key
on).  The right rear turn signal should flash and the left one
should be on steady.  When they let off the brake, the right
one should keep flashing and the left one should go out.

This should get you legal and safe, except you will have no
hazard flashers.  If you want hazard flashers, you will need
to implement them with aftermarket relays.  Off the top of
my head, I can think of a way to do it using three relays,
another flasher, and the original hazard flasher switch.  Let
me know if you want detailed directions.

You're done.  :)

Please let me know if you have any questions.
