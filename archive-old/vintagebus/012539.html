My experience was to call Ronnie and say &quot;Ronnie, find me the
best you can!  German if possible, but at least the best you
can find in the world.&quot;  Ronnie says &quot;OK.&quot;

Two weeks later Ronnie comes back and says &quot;It's not all
German but it is the best avaliable.&quot;  &quot;Cool&quot;, says I,
&quot;Send it and put it on my card.&quot;

That's the best way IMHO.

&gt;     After all this work, and it IS a buttload of work, I would caution you
&gt;     to NOT use cheap bearings in the redux box.  The good stuff is 5 times
&gt;     as expensive but do you really want to go in there again?  After I
&gt;     rounded up the good bearings, I looked at, gently spun, and otherwise
&gt;     played with the cheap bearings I bought first in my ignorance.  The
&gt;     difference is apparent to even the most untrained eye, ear, and
&gt;     fingers.  You don't want to do this job over again because you didn't
&gt;     spring for decent parts.  End of lecture.  PS, you won't find the good
&gt;     stuff in a mail order catalog.  Go to a bearing supply house or a
&gt;     &quot;real&quot; Vw parts house with the old bearings or the numbers off the old
&gt;     bearings.  They are very standard items.  Expect to pay $25-30 each.
