&lt;&lt; jinxed me.
 
 I'm getting a clicking noise accompanied by a vibration from one of my
 rear wheels.
 
 I can reproduce it by pushing the bus with the engine off.
 
 I can NOT reproduce it with the wheel in the air.
 
 I'm hoping this isn't the diff.
 
 Does anyone have any thoughts beside bearings?
 
 Thanks,
 ...Markus (and Tardis)

Hi,
If in doubt, then jack up the rear wheel and with the fronts bloicked, take
off the E-brake.  Then see if there is any movement if you try to tilt/wiggle
the tire with one hand on each side, if more than 1/16&quot; of an inch then the
bearings are probably bad.  To make sure, drain the reduction gear box and see
if there are any chunks of steel in the oil.  Anything bigger than 1/32&quot; dia.
and the more the worse it is.    Eric &amp; Barb
