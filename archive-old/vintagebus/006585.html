Ask Stephen at stephen_at_i405_dot_com if he will send you pics of his Berg linkage
that I set up on his engine, took me over 3 hours to get right and still
don't know if it's 100 per cent, but haven't heard any complaints from
Stephen

Some of you may remember my predicament with the Berg carb linkage that is
&quot;supposed&quot; to work with Kadrons.  The linkage arm on the left carb is at a
pretty radical angle which only gets worse as you accelerate.  I got some
pics of the setup (thanks Matt).  I threw them up at
http://www.geocities_dot_com/mrvdubb/ .  So feel free to take a gander and see
what ya'll think.
