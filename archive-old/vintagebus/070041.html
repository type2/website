It doesn't, mainly because you're pushing heat against the temperature
gradient.  The ideal power can be determined, but I won't go into that
here, mainly because I'd have to bone up a bit on my thermodynamics.

The big difference is in the efficiency of the compressor.  Back when
everyone had huge V8s the efficiency didn't matter much, but with smaller
engines it does.  Modern rotary compressors are a lot better than the old
swash plate units.
