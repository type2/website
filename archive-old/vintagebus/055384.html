&lt;&lt; I am thinking of getting both of them and selling one off. Anyone have any 
input on price or interest in either. &gt;&gt;

Hi Mathew,
We have seen Westie hitches go for as high as $600.00 for NOS and as low as 
$300.00 for a used one missing some of the hardware.  We would love to have 
one for our 1962 Flip-seat SO-34 Westie, but for now will just stick to our 
VOA hitches.  Eric&amp;Barb
