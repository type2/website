&gt;The dilemma continues.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;     &quot;WARNING:
&gt;
&gt;Although portable radiant gas heaters are great for outside use, they are
&gt;not appropriate for use inside tents, RV's, campers, vehicles or enclosed
&gt;shelters. Since a portable radiant heater consumes air (oxygen), using a
&gt;portable gas heater, regardless of size, inside any enclosed area poses the
&gt;threat of carbon monoxide poisoning.
&gt;
&gt;ALWAYS USE PORTABLE RADIANT GAS HEATERS OUTSIDE!&quot;
&gt;

It is my belief that you should get a heater that puts out alot of heat, 
Then open several windows. You wont feel cold and you will get warm.
A friend of mine used a radiant heater in his bus in near zero temps. He 
found that only the surfaces facing the heater got warm, and that he 
actually was cold most of the night. Also had frost on the inside windows of 
the bus.

I use a coleman propane heater that is not a radiant heater per say, I open 
windows up wide and even crack the door slightly. With it running at night 
the bus is warm and venting off heat and gasses, and draws in oxygen.
