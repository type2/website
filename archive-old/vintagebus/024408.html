Subject: Panel Repair Options 


Purpose:  I am in the process of replacing some rusted panels on my
bus.  I am wanting to get some opinions on which panel replacement
process offers the best long term structural integrity and rust
prevention.

Process: There are several was to replace panels that I am aware of;

* butting up panels then welding then smoothing off the mig weld for
finishing (weakens the weld?)

* flanging the panel  then punching holes in the repair panel overlap
then spotting the panel on then grinding for finishing (rust forming
between overlap?)

* crimping a 45 angle on the edge of each  panel then laying a bead
between the two
pieces then grinding for finishing

* or even brazing the two panels together.

- Weld through primer used before welding the panel on and heat applied
to panel kept to a minimum.

I think those are about it, other than No Weld bonding materials.

Any input / experiences would be appreciated.

Thanks,
