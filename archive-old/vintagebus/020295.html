well i made the trip to boston no major problems...rear wheel 
bearing seal began leaking somewhere out there(never heard of vw 
nor was it in there phone book) but i was lent a jack ,and did the 
repair with a little phone help from john yust and ronnie....thanks 
guys...then met up with john in knoxville for some wonderful 
homebrew and he helped adjust the timing, gave it a quick oil 
change and back on the road. evetually the clip on the end of the 
accelerator cable slipped and stuck inside the spring....jamming my 
throttle open...made it to the gas station, took it out, crimped it a little 
and then found out there was a bug shop down the street. waited for 
the owner while he was at lunch...got my partsnew clip, found a new 
wheel bearing seal kit(good to have a spare) then asked about 6volt 
parts. found a 6volt solenoid shut off valve, still need to install that...
overshot boston a little to maine for a reunion/fiesta on memorial 
day weekend, then continued to live in the bus for another week 
while my family celebrated my  brothers weeding a week long 
celebration with friends and relatves from as far away as japan and 
ireland....each in love witht he bus, but i refused to give it up.

i will need to sign off the list for a while, as i am unable to check my 
email frequently enough...i should be back on line this fall...enjoy 
your summer, and live in your buses

-kevin
