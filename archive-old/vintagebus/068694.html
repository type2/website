Subject: RE: [VB] engine

I'm rebuilding a '67 panel at the moment.
It's been converted to IRS and will run an L-Bug box.
I scored a great rebuilt '75 Bus 1600 DP engine that
has only done about 25,000kms(approx 16k miles) and a
trustworthy VW mechanic has checked it and given it
the big thumbs up.
Am I in for trouble?
The only real difference from stock is that it runs a
009.
And here in Australia and in Europe 1600 were
available in Panels &amp; Single &amp; Dual Cabs right up to
'79.
I haven't heard many complaints.
I know that running the engine a little richer keeps
it protected but is the DP cracking problem that
common and is it likely to be a problem for me?
Or am I just getting spooked?
One more question.
My brother has a set of 1300 SP heads machined to fit
on a 1600.
As such they create higher compression(I think?).
Would fitting something like this onto a 1600 or a
1640/1641cc for a bus be unwise?
Just curious to hear opinions.
:o)
