Hi Stuart and Sherri,
You might want to try a contact cement instead.  These cements work by 
applying a thin coat to both parts which you allow to dry and then upon 
putting the parts together.  We would suggest only doing the corners and 
letting the seal move and set in by the pressure of the window frame.
