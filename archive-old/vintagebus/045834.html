&lt;&lt; I want to upgrade my dog house cooler to the type 4 cooler.  What should
 I expect to pay for a cooler with adapter?  Can I get these new, or only
 used?   &gt;&gt;
Hi Steve,
We pick up each for $5.00 each at swap meets.  Due to the type 4 using a
filter instead of the earlier strainer you have far lees chance of the type 4
cooler of being clogged or filled with metal shavings.  Still you might want
to have the cooler cleaned and that way you can have it checked for any
troubles inside.  The only other item you need is the two longer studs to
mount the thicker cooler to the dog house stand.  These can be taken off the
type 4 engine case.  The third short stud is the same length and is used on
both type of coolers.    Eric &amp; Barb
