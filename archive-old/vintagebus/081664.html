Subject: Re: [VB] 62 twin cab progress and headliner question

&gt; I think it's more the door frame that's the &quot;standard&quot; part, though don't 
&gt; early RHD cargo doors have the handle on the rear door, too, Rob?

&gt; The RHD Bay Double cabs have &quot;normal&quot; left side rear doors, and I THINK 
&gt; that the post '64 RHD DCs had &quot;normal&quot; rear doors, but I can't be certain 
&gt; of that.

All splitty RHD DC's had suicide doors, regardless of the year. The door is 
the same as the LHD version so since its rhd and the loading door is put on 
the left, they used all the same equipment except for the B &amp; C pillar and 
rocker of course. Just a flipped door.
