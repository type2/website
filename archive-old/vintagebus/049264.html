I too am having carb difficulties, though of a different nature.
Mine is a 30 pict-3 on a dp 1600.  It starts and idles fine, but has some hesitation on liftoff. I'm thinking the accelerator pump volume? I'm not sure though. Any help here would be good as I was told I shouldn't have any problems running this carb as opposed to the PIS 34 pict 3.
BTW I run a stock single vaccum advance dist.
Also, my case is a rebuilt one, so I don't have the number to look up what the timing should be, are all dual relief cases set the same?
Thanks,
Jon
