No the bug linings are different then the BD, a lot of the Barndoor brakes
you find are actually bug brakes due to the unavailability of BD cores.
Early bug brakes will work but the shoes are a little narrower. Was told
this by a person in the know! I guess I could use bug brakes, but why
sacrifice the little stopping power they allready (BD) have.

Is relining unusual?  There is a place in Oly that does this (13.50 a set)

barndoor, late bug, 65 bus, whatever .  no big deal.   BDs have the same
pads 
on the metal as  58? through 68 bugs I think, 69 the bugs got larger brakes.


...............
 After much hunting for brake shoes for my 55 BD panel, I stumbled across a

place in Ontario, Cal. that can reline them, for those that care they are;


Valley Brake

415 w. Main

Ontario, Cali.
