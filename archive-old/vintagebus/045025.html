Hi Volks,
Very true!  Plus even if one lives and drives only in a dry climate one must 
remove the bra to wash the inside of the bra off and wash and wax at least 
the body area that the bra touches/covers.  Otherwise without the extra wax 
being replaced often the slight flexing movement of the bra from the air 
pushing it at high speed rubs the paint off.  Plus the dust/dirt/sand that 
gets between the bra and the bus body just add even more abrasive action to 
tear the paint up!  Like Cris says, use the bra only for long trips to save 
the paint from chips.    Eric&amp;Barb
