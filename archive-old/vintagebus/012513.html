Our hero went to  XXX XXXX vw specialist in Panama City FL, to find out
why his Kombi was down on power. The elderly black gentleman proprietor
was fixing to go home, but he listened to he bus and gave instructions on
how to fix it and directions to Marty's Discount Import Parts (free plug;
Marty's got Bus experience). There our zero purchased a  009, installed
it and static timed it. problem solved.
This is most difficult to write and probably belongs on a chat line some
ware, but as most all WV people our hero has met  are among the most
genuine of human beings. How many times have you stopped to help fix a
strangers Vee Dub along side the road?
 Point made.
Maybe this should be shared.
 Our hero made some instant friends in Ft. Walton Beach were he rechecked
his valve adjust and tightened his rocker shaft nuts in more comfortable
surroundings. The  #3 exhaust was sticking but after he turned the engine
over through a complete four cycles,he was able to get it back to spec.
Thanks to his new found friends he got his act back together, now he
could do a planed break down rather than a out-in-the-sticks break down.
He searched for a machine shop were he could get head work done. No shop
could be found. The guy who met the demand was folding up shop and no one
shop had  yet filled his shoes.
 When he went back to XXX XXXX  VW specialist during business hours he
had the proprietor check out the old dist., bad vacuum can.
Now for the difficult part, he noticed the man was in his fifties and was
obviously ill. He brought the subject up in the most tactful and
respectful way he could. Having previous experience in geriatrics and
hospice he could respond to the man's conversation with some degree of
empathy. It was true the man was sick, he had leukemia, but that wasn't
the reason that he was only working part time; he was taking care of  his
soul mate, his wife sense youth. And the difficulty was, she was unable
to reciprocate his obvious love. After a stroke she was unable to care
for herself  physically and had slipped into dementia. While the man
unburden himself  and they shared experiences of the sort that make one
wonder; the Kombis woes ( and our hero's ) didn't seem all that
important. Perhaps there was a providence, a lesson learned, to put
things in their proper perspectives for our hero. One can only hope the
same for the man.
love is not to be found
love is not to be made
love is only to be shared

Mahalo for your attention.

The receding greatness of the sky
 becomes atmosphere from were I lie
and the whole earth becomes a planet
made of gaseous soup and granite
and as I recline the world levitates
spinning in time towards heavens gates
and the big things in my life are small
because it's a wonder I am at all
