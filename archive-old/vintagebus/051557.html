Subject: Re: [VB] Front Shocks????

We got it straighten out.  I had order form online.  After a few calls with
them on Friday I noticed in the print mag that they had made a correction on
numbers.  Turns out somewhere in the past they must have caught this.  Just
not straight on the webpage.  Simple mistake, they sending out the correct
shocks and reimbursing me for shipping the others back.  Can't ask for
anything else.  Got to expect some mistakes along the way I guess.

&gt; I know what you mean.  they gave you fronts for a bug.  those have a
pointy
&gt; up stud that goes through a hole then a nut &amp; washer goes on.  That's what
my
&gt; 69 bugster has at least.  The rears for the bug were the same as all
around
&gt; on the 55-67 bus - eyes both top and bottom.  (I like the KYB GR-2s)   But
&gt; for the BD I had to get a dif size (smaller ) for the front (still eyes
top
&gt; and bottom though) , and the rears are lever shocks.  Most places are not
&gt; very familar with split buses.    Maybe the guy who wrote down the order
&gt; thought you said &quot;bug&quot;, or just wrote down the wrong thing.  They sent you
&gt; the wrong shock.

&gt; &lt;&lt; OK here's another question;  I ordered from Shocks from a Bus parts
&gt; company.  The shock that came has an eyelet in the bottom and a stud top
&gt; (that goes through a hole and accepts a nut)  I  called to tell them they
&gt; sent the wrong shock.  I order the shock from them to fit a 57 to 67 Bus.
&gt; They tell me what I received is the correct shock for a 67 Bus.  My 66 has
a
&gt; shock that has an eyelet on each end.  They als tell me that they've sold
&gt; 1000's of these shock and had none returned.  So if this is the correct
&gt; shock.  What's going on with my frontend?  The picture in the Bently shows
a
&gt; shock with eyelits on both ends.  They tell me the Haynes shows the shock
on
&gt; 67 like the one they sent me.
&gt;
&gt;  This is in no means to slam anyone.  I had a big order that was received
&gt; fast and everything else was there.  I'm just confused on how this shock
fits
&gt; a Splitwindow Bus.
