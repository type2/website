&gt; #2) 50ies period camper interior
&gt; Price is 600$

&gt; This camper interior was removed from a pre-march 57 standard. The bus was 
&gt; originally purchased in Oceanside, CA and included this &quot;dealer installed&quot; 
&gt; camper interior. 

hmm, since you put dealer installed in quotes, i assume that means you
have no idea who installed it for sure...

This kind of camper interior is made out of plain old wood.  Hotvw's used
to have ads for plans in the back of magazines.  Unless one knows the
history of the bus one has no way of knowing if this is homebrew, sundial,
ezcamper,  or when it was installed. It could have been a home-woodworking
project from the late 70's just as easily as it could be period...

take care,

Steve
