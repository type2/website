Subject: pulsating pedal problem solved?
Cc: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

A week or so ago I posted about some inconsistent pulsations in the 
brake pedal. Several list members pointed me in the direction of the 
rear brakes. I stopped by NAPA and picked up some pads today and 
decided to dig into the brakes.

The right rear drum would only come of about 6mm and then stop. I 
slacked the adjustment on the brakes and it came free. The problem 
was now clear. For whatever reason the was a nice groove about 1mm 
deep and 4 mm wide all the way around the drum. There was a 
corresponding ridge in the leading shoe but on the rear shoe the 
ridge gently faded into the surface of the pad. The the drum riding 
on the ridge would push against the hydraulic force of the brakes and 
then fall off again in a cycle.

I have no idea what caused the original damage to the drum as this 
bus is rather new to me. The odd wear in the  rear pad would seem to 
come from a poorly adjusted brakes. Since I saw no point in trashing 
a set of new pads

I did a spiffy job of adjusting the rear pads and being careful to 
reset the shoes pre Bentley. A test drive revealed much less 
pulsating. I will keep on top of adjustment until replacement drums 
arrive.

Thanks
Chris
