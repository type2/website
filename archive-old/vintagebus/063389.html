&gt;Anybody know what could make my blinker blink way too fast??

Lots of things.

* Lamp load excessive - higher-wattage-than-stock lamps installed.
* Load excessive - short to ground in lamp wire.
* Load excessive - another load inadvertently connected in
  parallel with lamps. 
* Lamp load too low - lower-wattage-than-stock lamps installed.
* Load insufficient - open in lamp wire.
* Load insufficient - burned out bulb.
* Flasher voltage doesn't match system voltage (6 V / 12 V).

I know these two conditions (load too high / load too low) seem
like opposites, but different flashers react in different ways
to improper loading.

What year Bus do you have, what voltage is it running, and what are 
you using for a flasher?  If it's a round can flasher it'll either
be stock-ish (VW, Bosch, or SWF markings) or aftermarket (three-digit
number).  On later splits, the flasher is inside the 9-prong box.
The round cans and 9-prong boxes are all marked with the correct
voltage; if it doesn't match the voltage in your Bus you may have
found the problem.
