&lt;&lt; What was the correct color for ribbed bumper brackets and the splash pans?
Black?Gray?Color of the bus?Was it diff depending on truck or bus? Thanx &gt;&gt;

Correct color of brackets is the color of the bus (lower half if two toned),  
they were painted as a unit along with the bolts and nuts.
splash pans were black.
