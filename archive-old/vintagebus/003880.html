&gt;So what's the story on these eyebrow thingies anyway?
&gt;do they have some practical purpose or are they just a way

They were an accessory to limit your visibility from the air during wartime.
Even though the pilot could probably see the lit area from your headlights,
it was harder to pinpoint the car without being able to see the headlights.
From a practical standpoint you shouldn't need them unless you experience a
lot of air raids in your area.
