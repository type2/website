I figured this book of his, since it used such a general term as &quot;microbus&quot;,
they were refering to the deluxes meaning a SIGNIFICANTLY different model,
cause that was all that was left of the major categories besides standards,
so thinking that - it would have more :) Seems like most ppl refer to
deluxes with more windows than a kombi, as &quot;microbuses&quot;....Guess its one of
those he said she said deals. What does barndoor mean again?  heheh

&gt;&lt;&lt; &quot;Kombi&quot; - some windows
&gt; &quot;Microbus&quot; - lots of windows &gt;&gt;

&gt;Same amount of windows on these two species. I remember back in the 80's
the
&gt;magazines, and even a SOTO video I bought referred to hard top deluxes as a
&gt;semi-deluxe. And referred to standard models (two tone paint) as deluxe
&gt;kombis.
