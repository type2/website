Subject: Re: [VB] Re: My new 65 Deluxe!

Illinois is the same only they dont even need to know
the sales price.  There are times that I wish this
state had inspections however, especially when I am
anywhere near some of the pieces of shit some of the
immigrants drive.

&gt; Hey Eric,
&gt; 
&gt; I don't know where you're at, but in GA (and
&gt; probably others) you just get a 
&gt; bill of sale if the vehicle is over 10yrs old.  The
&gt; PO of my bus just gave 
&gt; me a piece of paper stating he was selling it and
&gt; for what amount and dated 
&gt; and we both signed it.  Being from IN I was totally
&gt; sketched but titled the 
&gt; bus in SC w/ no probs.  Check all the states near
&gt; you.  SC didn't even look 
&gt; at my bus at all!
&gt; 
&gt; Good Luck!
&gt;
