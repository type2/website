Subject: Full-Flow FWIW

fwiw...

i've been lurking for the past few months on a few different lists(because 
i own several different types of vws), asking questions when i have them 
and cataloging useful info. 

posts like these, make me laugh, i need to laugh in the middle of a sleepy 
day at work so i don't flatline...

i consider myself a very laid-back non-technical vw/type 2 guy, and this 
list suits me more than any other, i can relate to you guys, thanks!

matthew

ps, i'm sooo looking forward to getting my bus on the road, and reading 
this list helps keep me motivated.

OK Bomber crew!
Mikes house is straight below us, look out the window you'll see his VW
bus.
We're going to go out make a tight turn, dive in at 1200 feet and drop
our payload on Mikes house and Van.
If you screw up and miss either the house or van we'll have to do it all
over again tomorrow.
