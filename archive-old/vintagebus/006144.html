Wolfsburg west sells both the aftermarket muffler (215$) and tips(10$) (I
think they still have NOS ones):
muffler  http://wolfsburgwest_dot_com/cgi-bin/wwshowpn.cgi?PN=211251051B
 tip http://wolfsburgwest_dot_com/cgi-bin/wwshowpn.cgi?PN=211251185B
BTW-  Make sure they dont screw up and send you a looong type1 tip...Thats
what they did to me, then when i got a chance to send it back, they wouldnt
take it back even though I had the receipt. ok.

Type1 tip for sale, mint condition, 10 bucks plus shipping.

&gt;Hi All, Does anyone know a source for a 36hp Bus muffler? (and/or tip) I
see
&gt;RMMW has some for $249 ...Seems like a lot of $$$$ Hmmm, or Maybe thats a
&gt;good deal....?
