&lt;&lt; Is the fuel cap in a 60 single cab supposed to be vented?&gt;&gt;
Hi John,
You bet it it should in at least all 1949-67 buses.

&lt;&lt; My new cheapo repo is not, and with no gauge sender or other leaky places 
on the tank, I'm getting some pretty big suction on the tank. Enough so the 
cap doesn't want to come off after running for 5 minutes. Will this collapse 
the tank?  &gt;&gt;
Yes it will.  Have known some to end up crushing the sender due to this!
