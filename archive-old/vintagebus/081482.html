Subject: RE: [VB] Electrical mystery

You have direct short someplace.  Does the voltage go to 0 if you try
and start it or just when you turn the key to 'on'?

Dan asked:
Need a little help with my electrical system. Its a 12 volt converted
'65 Bus that has a dead electrical system. The battery checks out at 12
volts and I have 12 volts going to the fuse box and to the headlight
switch and to the ignition switch. When I turn the key, the whole system
loses voltage. I tried to isolate the problem by by passing the
headlight switch but I get the same results. I even tried hot wiring by
bypassing both the headlight switch and the ignition switch but with not
result. What to do, what to do? Any ideas?
