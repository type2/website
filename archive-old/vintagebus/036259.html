Diana,

Yes, I think that your problem is probably the &quot;barrel type thing&quot; that the 
clutch pedal pivot pin rides in at the frame.  When it gets rusty, it will do 
exactly as you describe.  It's not a big thing to pull the pedal out and sand 
off the rust and lube it.  Took me about 1 1/2 hours max (even as slow as I 
work) on my (daughter's) '67 a couple weeks ago.  I wouldn't put it off 
forever, 'cause it may continue to tighten and stay down just enough to burn 
up your clutch disk eventually.

Good luck, 

JP
