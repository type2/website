Have a huge collection of VW icons on one of my pages, why not go check
it out?  Even though you'll have to wait for all my product images, I've
put up wall paper, event sounds, icons, screen savers, etc. to build
your very own theme for windows.  Not only that but you can also check
you gas mailage, register your VW, take a driving test and look at
badges, old vw's, etc.  Go have some fun, it's on the house.  Thanks for
visiting.
