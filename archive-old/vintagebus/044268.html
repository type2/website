&lt;&lt; &gt; how would they get there?  their unknown gear ratios, too small

 Actually, I haven't been to the mideast since I was a teen (a bit longer
 than I like to think it's been :-), but when I was there last (in Israel)
 there were a fair number of busses.   &gt;&gt;

never been to the middle east myself, but people I have met who were from 
there (and from Somalia, which is right across a gulf) commented on my old 
bus and said how they had them back there etc etc etc.  I mean, if they sold 
them in the 60s, they wouldn't have rusted away, right?
