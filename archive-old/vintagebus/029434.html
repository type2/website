Try POR-15 http://www.por15_dot_com. They have an Auto Fuel Tank Repair Kit listed
on their Restoration Kits page for $49.95. I ordered one of the Motorcycle Tank
Kits from their site and it arrived in 2-days. I haven't used it yet so I can't
comment on the product first hand. I do know many others who swear by their
products though.
