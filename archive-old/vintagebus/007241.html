&lt;&lt;There's no need to panic and start running for the bus when you hear the engine start to scream. I just drops
down to a nice idle by itself. &gt;&gt;

Your lucky it works as it's supposed to.

It seems to me that what probably happens goes something like this. As our rides age, things start to tighten up in the throttle area.  The relaxation of the choke mechanism is hampered by all of this tightness. Then in a mistaken attempt to keep the idle down, some P.O. installs a stronger return spring or shortens the existing spring. This only makes the situation worse.

Goes to show you that all that money spent on engineers was not wasted. Keep it like they intended and well maintained and you should have few problems. Remember those engineers were paid to design things as well as to not add it if it wasn't necessary.
