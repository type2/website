Well, after stories of keeping a platic can of fuel in the oposite to
battery tray, and this rolling onto the manifold, getting hot, expanding,
and spraying petrol everywhere....:(((
and not liking the idea of keeping petrol inside the bus, or for that on a
roof rack... ok better there than inside.. but what about the sun?...  no
thanks!
So after chatting through the wiring set up, and recieving an almost gratis
sender.. - it always pays in the end to help others along the way doesn't it
:)

I cancelled the trip over the weekend, and set about cutting the sacrificial
hole in the bus.

what i've learnt; -- might even be some help to the many others on list that
have bus gauges.

my 60 bus shouldn't have a gauge but has a po* fitted one.
the gauge the (or a) po put in is a 6 volter, that has a little oblong
&quot;thingy&quot; fixed to the back. This is appraently a voltage stabiliser.
The sender the po has fitted was too short (possibly a bug sender?) the
replacement was 1 1/2 inch longer.
and the wiring is G on the back of gauge right up back to the terminal on
the sender.
sender is earthed via a mounting screw.
the positive terminal is connected to ignition on switched.

i had to bypass the &quot;thingy&quot; because either way i dry ran it, the gauge read
right for a second or 2 then down to empty then pulsed up and down.

tried it mostly inline of the positive feed.

any idea whats wrong here?

having said that i now have gauge that works. (even tho its a 6 volt gauge
and the system is now 12).. so praps thats where i should stop thinking
about it... but i like to know.

Glynn   -- plastic petrol can is staying put in the shed.  (empty, with the
lid off!)
