&gt; Glad to hear the Sundial is still racking up the
&gt; miles....I just got a 65 21 
&gt; Window.  I really missed that old Sundial badly and
&gt; although the 57 vert I 
&gt; bought was nice, I had to have another bus.

Hey Scott,
Glad to hear about your 'new' bus...When are you
driving it out west?
We (myself, wife and 4year old) just put 4200 miles on
the 67 Sundial Camper in our two week camping trip out
to South Dakota. We had a wonderful time and almost
made it to Denver to stop by to say hello, but, ended
going up to the Tetons instead. Maybe next trip.
We took a trip down to Phoenix a couple of months ago
with the same Bus on another vacation. Man, soo many
miles.
I just took out the engine to put into my 65 Standard
Delux to get it out on the road and I but a BRAND NEW
VW engine in the Sundial! I'll tell you, I am sold on
the NEW VW engines from Mexico. Even with all of our
'stuff' for a two week camping trip including a loaded
Westy roof rack I averaged 23MPG.I purchased the
engine through Ronnie in Arizona. I ordered it one day
and it showed up at my house the very next afternoon.
While putting on all those miles, we have not had a
single problem with the Bus. I make sure to do all of
the maintenence BEFORE the trips. People should not be
afraid to drive their busses. Although we have a new
R**deo which has ALL the modern features, we still
drive one of our six Split Type 2s on a daily basis
including on our vacations.
