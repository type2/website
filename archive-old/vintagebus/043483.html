&gt;Hey, you could have bumpin' toons *AND* an extra heater!

I checked and 0.5 mm^2 is actually 20 gauge,  98.5 feet (30m) for
one ohm.  A Bus is around 4m long plus a little to go up from the
dash and down in the back, so say 4.5m, making the round trip 9m
or 0.30 ohms.  If your amp can deliver 200 W continuous into a
4 ohm speaker connected right to the amp, it's basically supplying
28.4 V at 7.1 A (*).  Add that 0.30 ohms of wiring in and you drop
to 6.6 A; across your 4 ohm speaker this gives you 173 W, a 13%
hit.  You dissipate 13 W or so in the wires.  So, your tunes
bump a little less and you don't get that much heat.  

I was actually thinking that those two wires would make a good
bus to multiplex the outputs of the A/D converters for the
sensors in the engine compartment.  With 300 bits per second
and a 10% overhead for the protocol, you can get 270 bits
per second - enough to update 30 temperature gauges with a
-100 F to 400 F range in 1 F steps once a second.  Heck, even
110 bps would be plenty.

It must be Friday.  :)

Seriously, thanks to all who responded about the &quot;mystery wires&quot;.
It seems they go back to at least '54 and maybe '53, but I don't
have a NOS '53 headliner to give Claralw to find out...

* For the engineers: VRMS, sine wave, at a frequency where the
speakers' impedance is 4 ohms, OK?
