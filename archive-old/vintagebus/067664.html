Subject: Re: [VB] Buses in PA?

Try contacting the People's Car Club, a tri-state VW club in the SW
Penna, western MD, northern WV area.  They are the Maryland chapter of
the VVWCA.  There is a website at http://www.gti16v_dot_org/tpcc.htm. 
Perhaps the club has contacts that might be able to give you some
reliable leads on buses for sale.

&gt; wondering if anyone new about any buses for sale in PA or Maryland.... I
&gt; realise that they are hard to come by, but if you know anything or have any
&gt; ideas.... please drop a line.
