Subject: Re: [VB] Daily Driver Poll/Bus Sighting :p

Back in the late '70s used to drive my '71 bay all over LA and Orange
county's. In fact used to commute from Huntington Bch to my job in Long Bch.
Friends used to recognize my van from the oil filter visible at the rear.
Used to drive it all day thru the deserts of SoCal and Nevada. Probably why
it pucked it's guts out south of Bakersfield. Made for a long tow back over
the grapevine. Different time, 55mph speed limit and a built motor meant I
passed a lot of cars. Now older,wiser(somewhat) and four buses in the yard
and not one runs!And here we are on the island with great secondary and
gravel roads, not to mention the infamously slow driving canucks ; ) Soon, I
tell myself.

&gt; Shows the rural lightweight I am I guess :)
&gt;
&gt; &gt;Aw, heck, I drive my stock '71 bus in the SoCal environment all the time.
&gt; &gt;Stay in the right lane, speed around 58-62 and never have a problem.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Lots of vehicles do the same thing, including most of the trucks.
&gt; &gt;Remember that the truck speed limit in California is 55 still, so most of
&gt; &gt;them run 60-62 if they want to avoid conversations with John Law, so
buses
&gt; &gt;fit right in.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;I suppose I could feel peer pressure to go faster, but I enjoy my bus too
&gt; &gt;much to shorten the trip!  Just because someone else is driving 90 is no
&gt; &gt;reason that I have to as well.

&gt; &gt;&gt;  &gt;Hate to say it, but the vintagebus_dot_com panel has been relegated to
&gt; &gt;&gt;  &gt;backup, show, and Home Depot duty.   It's just not competitive in
&gt; &gt;&gt;  &gt;this region's traffic environment.
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt;  The ONE time I went to California for D*sney, OCTO, The Classic, we
&gt; &gt;&gt;  took the modern mini-van. All I kept telling my wife was &quot;How the
&gt; &gt;&gt;  F*CK do they drive a VW Bus on these highways!&quot;. The Highways I was
&gt; &gt;&gt;  on in California were absolutely the worst roads I've ever driven on.
&gt; &gt;&gt;  Seems like there's so much traffic they don't have a chance to fix
&gt; &gt;&gt;  'em. People doin 90 on horribly torn up bumpy &quot;highways&quot;.
