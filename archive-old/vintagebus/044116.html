It has been argued that buses were shipped with the mirrors and wiper arms stored inside the bus for installation at the dealership. The idea behind it was that these items may be damaged during the loading, transit and unloading of vehicles onto cargo ships. There are several books that have photos of buses being loaded. I need to check for detail to support this.

I have seem some promo/sales pics of buses that did not have wipers or mirrors installed. I think a lot of these were shot at or around the factory so they may support the theory.

The bus in question is a German assembled South African delivery. Since many VW models sold in SA were shipped CKD and assembled in SA it would stand to reason that VW shipped complete models and CKD kits on the same ship and would adhere to standard shipping practices. This is just a theory and would like someone to confirm or deny it.

Forgive my ignorance in all this but could it be referencing the outside 
mirrors allowing the dealer to add those?
