Subject: Door Parts Needed.  1/2 2/3 seat frames for sale.

Well, Ive struck out at all the local service yards.   Does anyone have any
interior door handle assemblies for sale.  I have a 64 but its an early
model with icepick outside handles, so it uses the flat pull bar inside, NOT
the round one.  I just need the ratchet and cotter pin assembly that
attaches to the bar.  Handles would be nice too.

I also have a 1/3 2/3 seat for sale.  No upholstery or hairpads are on it.
Frame and springs are in very good shape.  Im offering this to the list
before ebay.  I have no clue what a fair price is, so just make me an offer.
