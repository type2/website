Subject: Everyone wants my bus! - plus painting question

Hi all, I need to share this with someone...

I don't know if theres something in the Sydney water, but in the last 2
weeks I've had at least 6 people tapping on my window wanting to buy the
bus! Someone else left a note and wants to give me money so they can use it
for their wedding! I mean I love my bus, but its pretty bloody rough,
unrestored and ordinary.

I've just got new licence plates, which I've had comments on too - &quot;BUS&quot; -
very cool.

Anyway, 2 Painting questions - specifically on painting metallics (not on
the bus!):
1. should you put a coat of clear acrylic over a fresh metallic paint job.
The paint itself went on really well, and I reckon it would buff up, but
should I clear coat it anyway while its still masked and in &quot;painting mode&quot;
2. can you / should you lightly sand a metallic (to get rid of
overspray/runs). does it make the metallic effect go to crap?

Thanks all,
Steve J.
