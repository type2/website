&gt; There was some outfit offering brand new Brazilian/German heads
&gt; for 1600 DP engines. I believe I placed order but forgot all about it.
Does anybody
&gt; remember who that was?


Yes, that was me. The list response was very positive so I did order about a
dozen extra pairs.  They are in a container that is due to reach New York
within the next day (or maybe already has), but it may be a week before they
clear customs and make it here.  These are NOT the Brazilian or Mexican
heads that you can buy at any other VW vendor. They are genuine VW/Brazil
bare heads with German components installed - the closest thing you can get
to German 1600cc dual-port heads. The projected price was $99.95 each, and I
am reasonably certain that the price will hold. (No indication at this point
that freight, customs clearance, etc. will be any higher than expected.)
Certainly I will honor that price for anyone who pre-ordered, or does so
before they arrive.  (Andre, I do have your order on file, and they will
ship the day after I get them.)  I will post a note to the list when they
arrive, if there are any more still available.

Incidentally, I will have some other goodies in that container as well;
details to follow.
