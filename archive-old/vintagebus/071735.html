Subject: Re: [VB] Need help locating a stock looking Bus for a VW event

It's interesting that while VW does not support vintage VWs, other car manufacturers do.  BMW , for example.   BMW dealers continue to carry parts for their vintage cars and motorcycles, and support events around them, as good PR for people with old BMWs to buy new BMWs.   Cause most people with old cars have new ones too.

Some people I know who are into old BMW motorcycles were surprised that there was so much aftermarket stuff available for the ACVWs, and nothing from VW.
