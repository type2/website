Subject: Re: [VB] Re: side scoops any opinions

&gt;....... No, plasma is disassociated nuclei and free electrons at very high
temps.
&gt; 
&gt; Turbulent flow is simply air that has lost its smooth laminar flow
&gt; properties.  Think of smoke rising from a cigarette.  At first the stream
&gt; is smooth and straight, but further up it starts to roil and tumble.  The
&gt; smooth flow is laminar, the tumbling flow is turbulant.
&gt; 
&gt; The turbulant flow near the bus doesn't have as much velocity as the
&gt; laminar flow further out, so the pressure available is smaller.  That's
&gt; why the scoops on F1 cars and such extend quite a ways away from the car.



The way George explains all this stuff almost makes me want to go back and
study Physics again, instead of just trying to get thru it!

Thanks George!
