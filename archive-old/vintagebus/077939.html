Hi all, especially Jerry and Melissa,

Thanks Jim for letting us all know that Uncle Jerry is hospitalized.  We hope
he beats whatever has him down, and we in Missouri are praying for them both!
Please keep us as updated as you can Jim (how about an address to send a card
to?).  Jerry's a legend in the VW hobby world, and we're not ready to loose
him yet!  Good karma is comin' your way Jerry!

Bill Bowman
