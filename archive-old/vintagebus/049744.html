OK, So here I am back again with another one of my questions this time its
not a  redundant mechanical question either!

So I was planing to fix up my bus quite a bit this summer.. Infact, I
wanted to restore it to a pretty good condition... I was planning on
painting the interior and exterior. But first, I have to do all this body
work... My cousin was going to paint it for me and I havent been able to
get a hold of him for a while (otherwise I would have asked him) But the
question was do I sand off all the old paint thats on there now right down
to bare metal? or do I just sand it down to the old primer or until its
realy dull? and the other issue Is that I am still driving this thing every
day... so its do a little work here and there and make sure its water proof
befor im done... Also what color should I prime it and what kind of primer
do you suggest? Im going to paint above the belt a off white and a
tanish-brown below.. Do I use difrent primers for the difrent colors? This
is my first attempt at preparing a car to be painted and I want to do the
job right... If it means that I realy have to decomission the bus for a
while then Thats what I will do but I just need to know where to go from
here.
THanks in advance!
