&gt;It contains Methyl Propyl Ketone (107-97-9), Xylene (133-20-7), N-Butyl
&gt;Acetate (123-86-4), Napta (6472-95-6), Magnesium Silicate
&gt;(14807-96-6).   Maximum V.O.C. 400 grams/liter.  (What the does that all
&gt;mean?)

Well, don't put your tongue in it. 8)

Whatcha got there is a fairly volatile metallic paint. Magnesium powder
suspended in a porridge of flashy petrochemicals and heavy alcohols with
acetate as a binder. I think you will find much the same potion sold as a
roofing compound for mobile homes.

&gt;I don't see zinc listed anywhere.

Magnesium, aluminum, they work too. It's a goopy silver paint and it smells
ghastly, right? It is probably a very good rust inhibitor if you can stand
to apply it.
