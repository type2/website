I normally would stop and ask if I could place a call or give them a
ride to the next phone or something like that... unless I get a weird
vibe about things.
	Recommending that people call the police was advice intended for people
who, for whatever reason, may *not* want to stop. Someone may think
their car is too dirty, too many people and dogs in it, freaky-looking,
whatever... That's their prerogative. The fact remains that they should
not have ventured out on the pavement unless they were prepared to meet
the police, whatever vehicle that they were in.
	 It is normal practice for law enforcement officers to check on &quot;code
20's&quot; (the local 10-code for broken down vehicles in TN) when on their
patrolled routes or if anyone calls one in. It is also fairly common
here for them to give the driver of said vehicle a &quot;10-14&quot; (here, an
&quot;escort&quot; or a ride...) to a telephone or gas station. Calling them
merely expedites a process that would probably happen anyway, especially
considering the volumes upon volumes of cell phones that people carry
nowadays.
	Vehicle seizure laws are being exercised daily. Everyone should know
this by now and take steps to ensure that they have no contraband in
their vehicles or outstanding warrants on the drivers. One item can get
your ride gone, forever... it will be sold later at a state-run auction,
and there is little you can do about it. People who &quot;carry&quot; and drive
are asking for it, showing little regard for their vehicles, especially
if they are lit up with the metaphorical neon sign saying &quot;Probable
Cause! Search Me Now!&quot;... keep it low-key.
	It is very likely that I would stop for any aircooled volkswagen
(especially buses!) without prejudice... given whatever extenuating
circumstances. I feel bad about anyone that has been searched and
hassled... been there myself. It's no fun having two Glocks zeroed in on
your chest for no apparent reason. Your only consolation will be a
contraband-free vehicle and the Internal Affairs department of the
agency involved, and the ID number of the officer (!). A majority of the
officers I looked at in their photo album looked the same: slightly to
moderately overweight, balding, moustache, uniform... couldn't ID the
raging idiot. end of story.
	Still... in some sketchy non-bus weird-vibe situation where someone
absolutely doesn't want the cops involved, the odds are that the cops do
need to look into things rather than the private citizen. If you want to
stop and help, fine, that's great. If your instincts tell you not to,
that's fine too. But it may be better according to universal natural law
and morals and things to send them some form of indirect aid rather than
to do nothing at all. I don't want people to get hassled, but I also
don't want any blood on my hands. The lesser of two evils seems
better... if you can't/don't want to stop.

&gt; You might at least ask them first if they have a number they want called or
&gt; whether they want the police involved.  Some people might NOT appreciate
&gt; having the police notified.  For every bus they help, I'm sure there's a lot more
&gt; that are search/hassled.  Even with no contraband, I'd prefer to give a passing
&gt; stranger a number of a friend to call, rather than have them &quot;helpfully&quot; call the
&gt; police for me.
