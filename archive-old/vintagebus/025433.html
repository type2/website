&gt; Gee, I hope the person/people who scolded me about correcting people &gt; on their
&gt; grammar and spelling are having a field day with you guys.  Keep it up &gt; I love it!

Steve,

Since we are so busy with the red ink, I should point out that it was a
person or _persons_ who earlier scolded you. &quot;People&quot; is not plural for
&quot;person.&quot; 
By the way, I was that person, and I told you in personal mail I thought
you had been a bit rude when you publicly corrected a fellow listee's
sentence structure. At least Thom has the grace and humor to do it
lightly.
