Subject: RE: Double Cab gas tank discussion
Date: Wed, 11 Nov 1998 11:59:15 -0800
Organization: EOU

The gas tank (at least on my 59 DC) can be reached by removing the rear 
bench and removing the two panels held in place by a few screws in the rear 
of the compartment.

There is a ton of space back there which should allow you to put a larger aftermarket tank there.

I'm not sure of the sender unit as my 59 has no gauge.

Good luck

DaveM.
