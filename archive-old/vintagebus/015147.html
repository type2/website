Here's the article:

&quot;In Defense of the Original, the Venerable, VW Bus&quot;
TOM: Thanks for all of your nominations for &quot;Worst Car of the Millennium.&quot; 
You brought back many painful memories for my brother and me!
RAY: Mostly for him, since he owned most of the cars you folks nominated. 
Before the voting, we wanted to print one more letter from a reader who 
objected to a certain nomination of ours.
TOM: In kicking off this contest, we had written: &quot;Romanticized as it was 
the Volkswagen Bus got blown all over the road, didn't have any heat to 
speak of and used-the driver's legs as its first line of defense in an 
accident.&quot;
RAY: Bob from Wichita, Kan., begged to differ. He took a much more 
&quot;philosophical&quot; view of the vehicle's characteristics:
Dear Tom and Ray:
Your description of the VW Bus was completely accurate but, alas, 
pathetically unenlightened. Further contemplation will bring you to these 
epiphamc conclusions:
(a) If a VW Bus shifts in the wind, it is simply because you are on the 
wrong path, heading in the wrong direction. Think of it not as a potentially 
lethal driving hazard, but rather as a spiritual GPS (Global Positioning 
System).
(b) Heat? Who among us has actually known heat? Is not one man's boil 
another man's frost?
(c) Factually, the driver's legs are not the first line of defense. Tom and 
Ray have overlooked the thick layer of bug guts aerodynamically meshed into 
a natural and practically impenetrable polymer covering the VW Bus' flat 
front. In addition, many Buses feature a front-mounted Triplated Independent 
Repealing Emobilizer (TIRE) combining the science of high-cost air bags and 
the proven effectiveness of amusement-park bumper cars.
Finally, and most importantly, remember that every VW Bus is surrounded by 
the plush and cushioning aura of St. Jerry of Garcia, providing divine 
truckin' guidance to freaks Deadheads, 17-year-old wannabes and balding, 
40-something used-to-bes.
I suggest you tie-dye yourselves to the front seats of a classic splitwindow 
model and hit the road for nirvana. You'll know you're almost there when the 
clutch cable goes out.ÑBob (balding, frostbitten owner of a goatvomit-green 
'76 Westfalia in Wichita)
Now, it's on to the regular mail.
