&lt;&lt; There are special tools to remove the steering wheel.  WIll one of those
 generic Sears models work (3-5 inch) or do I need a special VW tool.  If
 the latter, where is the best place to get it... &gt;&gt;
Hi Mark,
Hmm....   The only tool we know of which could be bought.  The arms of the 
tool would have to be modified or manufactured by you.   Two plates would 
have to be had made to go under the steering wheel.  A blueprint of these 
plates can be found in the 1959 bus shop manual.  Plus of course pictures of 
the completed tool.   Eric&amp;Barb
