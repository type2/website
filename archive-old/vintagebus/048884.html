Subject: Parking Brake Removal

Hi List!

My Memorial Day fun chore was going to be replacing the parking brake 
in my 67 Crew with the same (but working) item from a parts bus.

Unfortunately, I can't get either of them off!  Muir and Bentley both 
say (rather cavalierly!) to pull the clips, and then remove the pin 
holding the assembly to the chassis.  Both pins seem to be welded to 
the handle, and lots of tapping, penetrating oil, and some heat 
hasn't caused to the budge.

Any ideas?
