Subject: Re: [VB] EMPI rear stabilizer bar

Unfortunately, this EMPI rubber piece has already deteriorated away to
almost nothing--the sludge that was left came apart in my fingers.  I
can't even tell what it was **supposed** to look like.  So it would be
hard for me to try to find something else that looked close enough to
make do.

But thanks anyway.

Another thought: perhaps someone on the list has the correct piece that
could be photographed so I could at least see what I'm looking for.
