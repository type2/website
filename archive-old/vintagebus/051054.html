Subject: Re: [VB] Final verdict on oil hemorrhage

not long ago I started finally replaced the dead generator on my 65 and 
started her up.  It was a cold day (intermittant snow) and the oil filter 
(screw on to pump) blew and spit oil everywhere. what a PITA! ran to the 
FLAPS store and bought a slightly pricer one (which cost about $6) that has 
the pressure relief spring.  30 wt oil at about 30*F was just too thick for 
the filter, but the spring relief one worked fine.    Dunno how cold it is 
where you are, what weight oil you are using, or how much pressure your pump 
is putting out, but I do recommend spending the extra couple bucks for the 
filter with the relief valve.  Just in case you had the non relief kind.

&lt;&lt; Well, I spoke too soon.
 
 On the way to work this morning, the new oil filter they put on
 exploded. I am getting the feeling that the oil pump valve is sticking
 and the pressure is building to a *slightly* unacceptable level. It is
 back in the shop to get the spring checked.
 
 Yeah! I love my bus! :(
