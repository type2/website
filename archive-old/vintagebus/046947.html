&lt;&lt; We're about to install a headliner in our '58 23 window, and want to make
 sure we've got all the connections for our domelight harness accounted for.
 Does anyone have information on what the two wires that go to the very back
 are for? These go beyond the positive wire for the rear domelight. Thanks.

how about the speakers that mount in the back corners above the headliner.
