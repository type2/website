for the record, I plan on putting togethr a 1600sp motor out of used parts,
but will use new bearing - they are cheap anyway, I have lots of parts around
and am sure I can find enough that aren't too worn.  Not that I'd expect it to
feel new, but it would run and be cheap.

Wow- that trip around the Olympic Penninsula sounded great.  I really want to
get back up to those hot springs, see old trees and three foot long moss, and
beautiful lakes.  Oh ya.

haven't received anything from anyone about the 53 owners manual copies yet.
If I don't, I'll offer them for sale at Octobugfest, or the unclaimed ones to
other listees.  To the guy in Indonesia, I still haven't found out postage
yet.

Is there an MX code for a late bug shift coupler put in a splittty askew so
that reverse gear is not accessible?

I can't drive 55.
