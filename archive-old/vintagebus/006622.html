First of all do you have 8 mm  or 10 mm studs?
Second; does the case have case savers all ready installed?
  If your answer is no to the second question you have 2 options. First you
could use an oversize self tapping stud to repair (if you have 10 mm studs,
as a case with 8 mm studs should have case savers allready or you can insert
a case saver).             
    If you have 8 mm studes and pulled the case saver, there are oversize
case savers available for repair, these are also available if you have 10 mm
studs and pulled a case saver.

Just got done assembling the short block 
put the cylinders and jugs on and started to torque the heads down 
when I realize that the appropiate torque of 23 ft #s is not happenig
the stud was already a 1/4 inch out of the stud.

guess I need a new case now 
to bad my first case has already been line bored
and I have matching bearings     dammmm
Any one know what to do when this happens ?????/
any one need a case that is line bored but needs a saver fixed ?
case has already been polished with a brass wheel to make it shine
I bet that It would make a great bonfire!!!!
