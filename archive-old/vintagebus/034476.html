&gt;  &lt;&lt; Or can someone tell me where it goes?  I scored one on ebay! :o),   The 
&gt;  part number is 211 129 511, , descr: adapt pip.  &gt;&gt;
&gt;  Hi JB,
&gt;  That bolts onto the lower exaust stud on the #2 cylinder after installing 
&gt; the 
&gt;  muffler first.  Not a bad part to repro, but you have to have either the 
&gt;  later 1500cc bus rear cover plate 113 119 523 F (?) or the same tin from 
the 
&gt; 
&gt;  1967 bug, but have to weld or bolts shut the other hole on the left.   
&gt;  Eric&amp;Barb
&gt;  

I have seen two kinds, one is a straight piece of pipe with a flange with 
hole to attach w/muffler nut.  The other kind is bent, and goes up just to 
the level of the rear tin preheat hole.   And have seen them in left and 
right side versions.  remember- 67 bugs had preheat both sides, and some vws 
had preheat on the left and some on the right.   I have the left version on 
my 61 with 40hp aircleaner on left, and the right version on my 65 with air 
cleaner on right.

Also the rear little pieces of tin under the cylinder tin- they came in a 
version w/ oval hole for the preheat pick up (the round tube goes through the 
tin at an angle so that the hole needs to be oval.) have seen them both L and 
R - the R with the version for the straight air draft tube and also for the 
squiggly bottomed air draft tube.

with the pick up pipe the air comes from right next to the head so it is 
hotter, and the pipe keeps the little paper tube firmly in place.  very tidy. 
 The rubber grommets for the rear tin preheat holes are being reproed by WCM 
I believe.

re the rear tin w/ preheat holes, if you pick one up at a swap, check to make 
sure it isn't a 40hp piece, or it will be a tad too narrow and not fit, 
(unless you have a 40hp motor)
