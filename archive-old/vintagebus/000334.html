 &gt;&lt;&lt; Can someone tell me what the correct decklid would be on a 57 single cab?
 &gt; I've seen them in photos with and without the 3rd brakelight.  Which one is
 &gt; correct?
 &gt;  &gt;&gt;
 &gt;depends on when your bus was made.
 &gt;
 &gt;the center brake light (only, not third) was dropped in favor of two brake
 &gt;lights as of  5th april 1957 at chassis number 246 964.   The deck lid used
 &gt;for about 100 000 more buses was flat above the liscense plate area, not
 &gt;humped like the 59 and later ones.
 &gt;
 Also depends on what market your bus was made for
 
 I recently sold a double door panel built on 7 October 1957 which had
 semaphores and the centre brake light (don't have VIN on hand). Wolfsburg
 said it was shipped to Rhodesia.

1.   semaphores or blinky lights is separate from the decklid brake light.

2.  are you sure it was original?  People have been known to put a brake 
light decklid on as a 3rd brakelight

3.  my info says that is when they changed to the round glass taillights, 
which a re also brakelights, unlike the taillights for the buses with the 
center brakelight. This vin can be checked by anyone who has got a type2 
parts list from Steve Howell, who so kindly made them available.  Also 
anacedotatlly. 

4.  No idea of what they asked for in Rhodesia.
