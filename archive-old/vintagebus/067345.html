Subject: Re: [VB] Warm Bus equals Happy Driver!!!!

&gt; If I ever find the time, I'll have to put up some picutures on my web site
&gt; of the step by step process rebuilding a SW heater, really pretty easy if
&gt; you do it one step at a time.  If you can rebuild a carb, you can rebuld a
&gt; gas heater and enjoy a warm if not HOT bus in the coldest weather.

Rick,

That would be great.  How much room does a SW take up?  I've only fixed
Eberspachers and I thought I'd have to put one under the back seat of my
DC if I ever wanted one in there.  

Steve
