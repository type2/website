This weekend seems longer for some reason! 
As we usally do, Karl and I set out for an expedition on Saturday in his deluxe HT '66. Picked up 3 15&quot; Empi 8 spoke wheels from a Ghia in a salvage yard. Did some research on Ebay and found another set of  of 8 spoke wheels for sale, another set of 3!  
Then off to a secret salvage yard to look at two splitties. Anybody need a wide rear hatch? Still there, about the only thing left to salvage off the two. Maybe a good nose section. One rolled and the other rusty. 
Karl picked up a couple bay fuel tanks after passing on some very rusty ones earlier. One had 1/4 gas, 3/4 water in it. Wonder why it was in a yard for something  that simple. He installed one Sunday in the Deluxe and probably invented a few more 4 letter words in the process. 
One of 'em was a bit tough to pull out due to the 3 or 4 wood screws holding in the shag carpet tightly to the fuel tank! Yard tried to charge for the sending units but some negiation pried it out as just  fuel tanks. Good thing because both sending units were bad and needed an hour or two of work to make functional. 
I stopped by Karl's Casa de Olive and helped shove the engine in his '66 13 window today. The pressure plate ring was missing a few clips and had been siliconed onto the fingers! A donor plate from my '73 thing engine had fingers but no ring, so $40 later a new p-plate was obtained. Easiest engine install I've ever been a part of. A couple of shoves, no engine turns and it's hung. Karl's thread chasing and my long arm got that nasty hex bolt above the starter clamped fast and tight. It was more effort to adjust the clutch than throw in the motor. 6 volts started it on the first crank. 
I had spent the morning screwing the headliner panels in the doublecab. The last task is to chase some wiring demons that now allow the left turn signals flash, but not the right. Turn or high beam indicators don't work either. Got a 3' x 4' schematic printed and will tackle sometime this week. 
Highlight was posting for the first time on E-Bay. I picked up a nice set of towel bar Ghia bumpers and took pics on the bed of the doublecab (bus content.)  A Ghia buddy tried to peddle them on his lists, but the interested parties weren't. So off to E-Bay where they're soaring to finance the restoration of the Mardi-Gras 21 window.

p.s. found a &quot;no holes through the glass&quot; front window catch. What's it worth?
