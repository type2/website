&gt; Can somebody give me a good explanation/definition of
&gt; Dwell?

there are some good results out there if you search the web, but the
basics are this.

if you put power across a coils outside (1 &amp; 15) terms it basically
creates a magnetic field. release that field and it collapses. When it
goes down the energy is transfered to the other coil inside the coil
which is what the distributor is connected to. It steps up that 12V to
a lot (someone correct me, but something like 40k volts?). So that's
what gives you a spark for your sparkplug.

Now, onto dwell. Since you really don't want to hire someone to make
and break that contact on your engine we let a mechanical device do
it. These are the points. Dwell, is how long the points &quot;dwell&quot; at a
closed position. The longer the dwell [1] the stronger the spark. Why
not just set it dwell to a huge number? it had a tendancy to burn up
the points. 

setting the points w/ a gauge, will usually only get you in the
ballpark of the correct dwell. it must be measured with a dwell meter
dynamically. Currently the darn things are soo cheap its silly to not
have one. HTH

[1] dwell is measured in degrees. higher dwell is longer closed.
