Sometimes the switch was mounted on the back of the speedo and was activated
by the speedo cable.
&lt;&lt; All lights work except for the reverse lights.  I have power off of the
coil
and the in line fuse is good, but no power to the lights.  I was wondering if
any body knows
 where the switch is? At the shifter? or transaxle? any suggestions ? &gt;&gt;
