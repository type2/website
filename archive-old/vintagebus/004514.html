I had a great time at the meet and want to thank the OCTO guys for putting
it together. A good laid back time and there is still no cover charge, but
like flying Southwest, if you want a good seat you gotta check in early.
THE HIGHLIGHTS:
~I heard there were 175 split buses there. Don't know if that is official,
but I believe it.
~The twins in front of me with matching blue and white deluxe buses, one a
13 window the other a 21.
   Guess they were the original owners.
~An NOS rear hatch for a 63-66 panel. No window hole, very cool.
~Several NOS rear corners, including one for a corner window, A-pillars,
nose clips, etc.
~Tons of little doodads for around the bus, lots of which I bought.
~A green highroof with the seller flap that was an absolute knockout, plus a
cherried out white one.
~Mark Adair's original wooden widebed singlecab. Coolest truck around.
~The guy with the miniature split bus go-kart. He has a little woody
teardrop trailer behind it now, with his beer
  cooler inside. This thing gets more done up every time I see it. Working
safaris, lights, pretty dang nifty, and
  aircooled too.

Would have liked to have seen more of the Arizona folks show up, but all in
all a weekend well spent. 900 miles total and used 75 gallons of gas.
Definitely should have tuned the Westfailure better before the trip. Made it
home in 6 hours and only used 22. Sure isn't very economical running on half
of the cylinders. A set of plugs and wires made all the difference in the
world. 8^)
