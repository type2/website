List,

Now that I have found the information for upgrading
the headlight circuit (thanks to all who responded) -
it's right in the type2_dot_com library under H for
headlight.  Imagine that.  Now I'm hoping someone will
be able to help out again.  Is there someplace on the
net I can find out the &quot;standard&quot; numbering scheme for
electrical components?  I am guessing that, for
example, the headlight switch on my 66 bus doesn't
have the numbers 30, 56, 57, 58, and 58b randomly. 
There must be someplace that dictates a 30 terminal to
be something like &quot;fused power&quot; and 58 to be power
output or something.  Any ideas?  Thanks!

Paul
66 Crew cab (Fritz)
