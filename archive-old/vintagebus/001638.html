&gt;Craig
&gt;CUSTOM &amp; SPEED PARTS &lt;www.customspeedparts_dot_com&gt; has 5-lug front disc brake
&gt;conversion kit for pre 70 type2. I saw their ad in UK magazine, Volks
World,
&gt;and it says kit is from £559. I don't know if any vendor in US selling
their
&gt;product.
&gt;

Dave Palmer's creative engineering has links with customspeedparts...

i know, dave palmer was setting up a deal with bob koch... this was talk,
ages ago - so i don't know if this panned out... but should imagine this is
where you can get your safaris and* possibly these brake conversion kits...
not much help i know

btw, he was also talking of making the barn door safaris from aluminium... -
hmmm... cheaper, - rust free!! - i'd be worrying about the fixing tho.-
worth checking out.
