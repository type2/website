This is kind of cool in the realm of new possibilities.

Spotcheck Jr. put out by &quot;Magnaflux Corp.&quot; is a baby 
brother to the regular Spotcheck . . .

Spotcheck is a dye penetrant system for finding cracks
in ferrous or non-ferrous materials . . like engine cases.

The old, big kit was 3 spray cans . . and $100 . . 
Probably more now . . . cans the size of freon cans . . covers a lot
of area . . too much . .

The baby kit is listed in one catalog at $27.95 US . .
A refill kit is $19 . . .  

The kit consists of 4 cans, 2 of cleaner and one of 
penetrant and one of developer . . . and a bitchin' holder case . :-)

So . . you degrease with cleaner, spray with dye penetrant,
a red dye . . then you wipe off all the dye and then 
spray with the developer . . which is a powder-like stuff.

The deal here is that the dye got into the cracks and 
didn't get wiped off . . when you put on the developer,
it pulls the color up out of those cracks, giving you 
a pink line where the crack is . . .

This can also be used on things like the crank or cam
before you put them in . . every one of them rods . . 

If you are lucky, your crank was checked for cracks by
hitting it with a hammer . .  :-)

Personally . . I prefer to check engine cases with a 
rose-bud torch on the inside while I watch the outside.
Propane is adequate for this job . .

With just a little heat, the oil in the cracks, assuming
an old case, will weep out of cracks . .
A new case, or heads, you want to use the penetrant system . .

What makes this a big deal is the price . . if a crank
doesn't sound right or what and you'd like to use a 
dye check, $100 for the kit puts a big crimp in your resolve . . 

This is not a big item in most cases but there is always that one
time when it just doesn't feel or sound right . . 
&quot;holes in my confidence&quot; . .  hi performance boys may want to do all
engine parts . .  

This new $28 kit will make it a lot easier . .
