&lt;&lt; I too have one of these ( in the same spot ) that the PO had installed.

It can be removed without dropping the engine but will probably take you just
as long and give you alot more frustration than dropping the engine and
removing it.Plus,like the rest of us I'm sure your case studs could use
retourqing and other maintenance isssues caught up on.
