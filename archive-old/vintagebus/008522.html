&gt;last night a buddy and i were shooting the sh*t and admiring our type 2s
when i remarked that the front bumpers on our volkswagens are different.
they're both pressed bumpers but the one on his panel has a wider area in
the center between the two raised areas while the bumper on my truck has a
smaller area between the two raised areas.  his panel is a '54 and my truck
is a '56.
&gt;
The earlier/Barndoor style (pre-March 8, 1956) has a smaller license plate
portion which equates to a longer ribbed piece:

So, his bumper is wrong but yours may or may not be, depending on production
date.

In either case, Bill should definitely keep that phat front guard
arrangement, it's the cat's meow.  (Note the dichotomy of my 50s vs. 90s
slang, schweet!)
