&lt;&lt; But to see what your r&amp;p is, get or borrow a tach, and find out what 
speeds you have at 2K, 2500,  3K , and 3500  in each gear (well just 3K in 
1st). &gt;&gt;
Hi Volks,
Also check where 1,500 RPM is in 2-4th gear.  To go below this RPM especially 
in these higher three gears tends to lug the engine and allow the crank to be 
pushed into it's bearings.   Eric&amp;Barb
