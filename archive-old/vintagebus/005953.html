&gt; Karl and I came across a different type of side step. Heavy steel, form
fit to the inside rear of the front bumper. Two bolts to the bumper and it
has a two long tabs bent over the top of the bumper. I uploaded a couple of
pics to www.thesamba_dot_com/vw and could be posted soon. I'll send it to the
Gallery at www.vintagebus_dot_com in a few minutes too.
&gt; Anybody seen these? Can't find a brand or part number on the outside.
They're on Karl's new find. We went to check out the &quot;61 VW Combi Van&quot;.
Owner told us to look for the blue and white &quot;original color&quot; van.  Not only
was it a '65, but a hard top bench seat deluxe in decent  condition. Maybe
it was the homebrew from the night before, but we both passed on it.
Gathering our wits later that afternoon, we made plans to snap it up the
next morning. Karl had more room in his driveway than I do and less room in
his wallet, so the deal was made. I did get the honor of driving it 25 miles
back to Fresno with no passenger windshield and one popout out. 5&quot; of play
in the steering, no speedometer or lights made a cold, exciting, but safe
run home (stupid too, should have taken the T2 tow bar). We forgot to pick
up the blue middle mat, and need to go back and deal with them for a '61
single cab that I'd move my EV stuff into from the Thing, but that's another
story.
&gt;

Actually it is a 66....built on the 28th day of March, 1966.
I believe it still has the original engine [runs good] in it. The vin # is
246126769  and the engine # is H5043060. It is still 6V!! Original Seeblau
L360 / Cumulusweis L680 paint.
Not sure how long the right windshield has been broken out but the right
front floor is no longer a floor.
For some reason the cargo floor on the pass side has amassed large
holes....so the PO pop riveted a flattened 1/4 drum over the floor....the
left front pop out is missing.
Has the jail bars along both rear side windows but the ones for the rear
hatch are gone.
The face of the clock is broken.
Still has a Sapphire III radio in the uncut dash!
Needs a little work....
