Subject: RE: [VB] engine question

It almost sounds like you have starved a lifter. Have you tried running a 
thicker oil to see if the noise is subdued? It seems like it may be an 
oiling problem- as the oil gets hot and more thin it isn't adequately 
bonding to your engine parts. I'm by no means an expert- but I would check 
your oil pump as well. If it wasnt replaced when you did the top end work it 
may be in need or replacement or repair. Hope this helps

Kelly Reed
