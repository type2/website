Here is where I read about it:
http://www.pelicanparts_dot_com/914/How_to_buy_a_914.htm

Also look at the WebCam offerings here that differentiate between FI and
carb:
http://www.pelicanparts_dot_com/catalog/shopcart/9144/por_9144_engine_main.htm

Boston Bob did not have anything on his page specific to this issue, but
then again his articles are somewhat slim in the technical speak if you ask
me.
http://www.bostonengine_dot_com/articles/chaft.html

The bus is geared so low that I am sure that the WebCam WCAM-152 would make
a great choice.

Also I would reference the Wilson book for VW cam PN#s to see the different
cams that were built for the Type 4.


Hope this helps,

[...]

&gt; On your bus 912E engine conversion did you change out the FI camshaft when
&gt; installing the Webers?  This may explain HP loss in your bus.  The cams
are
&gt; specific for carbs or FI.  The FI cams probably do not have the proper
ramp
&gt; on them to create a vacuum for the carbs to give the heads a good gas
&gt; mixture.

I am a little puzzled trying to find the source for this suggestion.

1) 1700, 1800, and 2.0L with solid lifters all used the same camshaft 021
109 021L. [except auto trans buses, they have 2 narrow bands cast in the
shaft, see Bentley sec 5 page 59]

2) 2.0L 78-79 used hydralic lifters, camshaft 022 109 021A

3) all USA 2.0L buses from 76 to 79 were fuel injected.

Can you supply a part # for a carbed 2.0L?
