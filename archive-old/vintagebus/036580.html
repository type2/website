&lt;&lt; So my questions are: what are ALL the pieces I need off this bus
 to bring mine back to stock?&gt;&gt;
Well you should start with the shift linkage up front and see if you can
unbolt the front shift rod from the rear piece.  Just this part of the work
cost us about 3 days.  Do you know how hard it is to get a 1960 only shift
system for a bus?  Then you need the brake cables brake parts and drums, and
anything else you are missing.    
&lt;&lt; Are there any odd tools that I will need?&gt;&gt;
Just 3/4&quot; breaker bar (Proto 3/4&quot; E-bar is a lot better than the Craftman
slider 3/4&quot; bar.) and torque wrenchs for up to 100 ft lbs. and another that
will do 215 ft lbs..
&lt;&lt; How hard is it to take out the front beam?&gt;&gt;
Once you have the front shift linkage dissassembled it is not hard to do in a
weekend if you check all your replacement parts for compleatness and wear.
Dissassembly and greasing before installation will help alot there.
&lt;&lt;Right now my '62 has the rearend out of a '68 T3 (I think that's what the
DPO said) 
 	For those that have been asking about lowering their splits, when
 I get this finished I will have the T3 rearend, a set of Porsche Fuchs,
 wide 5 wheel adapters, and possibly the front beam for sale. All the stuff
 you need to lower your bus and look sano...just make sure you keep your
 stock peices, or give them to a good home (I wish my P.O. had). &gt;&gt;
You might want to trade this stuff for the items off someones elses bus.  that
way you will have extra parts and have saved the parts from possibly being
thrown out.
