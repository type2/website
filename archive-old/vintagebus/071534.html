In addition to that,

I have also heard that one can use a Pertronix or the like by modifying the points plate on the 010.  I took a gander and it looks almost as simple as grinding down a small tab, but I just can't find the time.

Don't ask Ronnie...that bastard has never had any 010 parts for me =)

&gt; There was someone not too long ago that had mentioned a place that was either using .009 points plates or was using a repop for the 010 and 019. Maybe Ronnie knows.
