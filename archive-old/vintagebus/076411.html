Subject: Re: [VB] Stereo &amp; Generator ?

----- Original Message ----- &gt; i am putting some sounds in the bus this
spring and am wondering how much my
&gt; 12V generator can handle. im sick of the mini, cigarette lighter powered
&gt; AIWA cassette player dangling off the dashboard! i wanted to get a cd head
&gt; unit, but a friend warned that the 100watts or so that they put out may be
&gt; too much.
&gt;
&gt; what kind of radios do y'all have running on your stock 12V buses?
&gt;

If you have any problems with power supply, just install a cap to the
system.

Years ago I had a system that would spike a 50 amp ammeter continously and
cause a lot of distortion (over 600 watt system in my 66 Westy). I installed
a 1 Fahrad cap into the system, and when playing my 'new' Nirvana album as
loud as I could stand it, it drew a steady 10-11 amps. Very nice.
