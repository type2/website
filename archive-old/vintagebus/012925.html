Aloha to the friendly and knowledgeable list members,

I will try to write in complete, polite, intelligible sentences because I
need your help. The metal reservoir on my Kombi is in need of
replacement. In a few short days I will be back on the US mainland to
prep my Kombi for shipment to Oahu in Hawaii. I have gone down to the
local library to search the vintage bus archives but did not come up with
any information on my master cylinder. I need to know if the plastic
cylinder my girlfriend bought for it at the FLAPS is a direct replacement
or if I need to order a metal one. I am hoping that the whole master
cylinder doesn't need to be replaced for this minor problem. Your kahua
(help) would be much aprciated.

Mahalo,

Ken

PS is there a list like this for aircooled bugs?
