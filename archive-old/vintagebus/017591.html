I've seen them at shows and on ebay.  Someone repro'd them, and
there's probably more repros than originals running around. 
I'll bet dollars to donuts that the ones going for big $$$ on
ebay as NOS were really repros.

Just because someone *says* they got it &quot;from an old german guy&quot;
doesn't mean it's the real deal.

&gt; the right direction?  Just wondering what they look
