   Rich Yost (aka Christmas Tree Island ) just cruised through Havasu on his
way back from a buskapade. This trip he had a 23 window deluxe and a Kombi
on his hauler and a Kombi Sundial on his truck and trailer rig. He came
through on Friday on his journey to collect buses and 3 days later comes
through again with a load of buses to rescue. For those that are coming to
the Classic weekend, don't miss out on the Christmas Tree Island Camp-out
(Rich's spread). Besides the 20 buses he has there, look at the other 20 to
50 that will be camping out. 

Ronnie

ps. The camping fee at Christmas Tree Island will be 1 tree to plant (any
size container). The Christmas trees are dieing due to age and we all want
to keep the Island alive.
