Subject: Re: [VB] Sapphire Radios

A couple years ago I went into Hemmings and found Wilford Wilkes of the 
Vintage Radio Shop in Brisbin PA to repair a Blaupunkt for my DC. 
Specializes in European auto radios but he might do a Sapphire as well, 
if he's still in business.  Ph 814-378-8526

Otherwise you could try Hemmings yourself, there is a whole section of 
ads at their internet site for people providing services like vintage 
radio repair.

&gt; Hiya list,
&gt; Can anyone recommend a place to send my Sapphire radio to get fixed?  I had
&gt; it converted from 6V to 12V a few years ago by Brad Clausen in the midwest,
&gt; but I don't think he does radios anymore?  Not long after I had it done, it
&gt; started getting a lot of static, and finally gave out all together.  Any
&gt; recommendations would be appreciated.
