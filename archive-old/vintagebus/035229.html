 Maybe its just that i'm a mechanic on large equipment and have alot off 
LARGE 
 tools.       I usually put a 36mm 6point 3/4 socket on it with the 3/4 air 
gun and 
 one shot it comes off, with no bangin of the nut, no damage.
 
 I agree with you on the axle nuts, if there really rusted in ther a 3/4 gun 
would run 
 the possiblity of damaging the threads.  &gt;&gt;

oops I think I had said 1/2&quot; drive in my previous post and I meant 3/4&quot;  too 
easy to break the 1/2 drive stuff in this kind of use
