Was looking at the latest Volksworld (one w/ yellow and white bus on cover) and noted that they mention somoene in Belgium has two 54 23' window sambas FS for ~5K english pounds.

Also same individual has two middle 60's doublecabs. One was ~ $4K english pounds and the other was ~900 english pounds.
