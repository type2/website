Subject: RE: [VB] Fuel Gauge Q

I just assumed that extra cable was a choke cable... I wasn't sure exactly
when they did away with the manual choke.  I'll have to crawl under there
and take a peek and see where that cable goes.  There is a knob to the right
of the regular heat control...so I assume there is a cable behind it :)  The
gas gauge is in german though...I think.  Its not English.

My M-codes are U23 and 382.  Maybe 382 was for a gas gauge?  I can't find it
anywhere...I thought maybe it was a &quot;package&quot; of m-codes as my bus has 6
popouts, windshield washer setup, gas heater (probably dealer or westfalia
installed), and probably a couple of other things.  I think U23 is the
westfalia code as the bus is a SO-34 model.

Thanks,
Isaiah
Listening to the weather man now... he calls for SNOW again on Saturday.
:(  90 degrees and sunny one day, 30 and snowing the next.

my 61 when I run to reserve I have to reach to the right of the heater
control to pull out the reserve knob.  passengers  have been surprised when
I
suddenly grab towards their left foot!!!!!   No choke control- that was for
36hp buses.

gas guages were options before 62. - standard equipment on ambulances.  They
read 'full' and &quot;empty&quot; or the equivalent is german, or spanish or whatever.
you probably have the M code for it on your M code tag.   I have seen only a
few pre 62s with original gas guage installation, pretty rare.
