We have returned to the high desert of So. Ca. after having a good invisible
time at the Buses in the Shop and all were kind and helpful BUT  They must have
moved Hesperia much closer than Monterey, Walnut Creek, and Marin to San Jose
than we remembered and it took two days to drive 450 invisible miles
 Thanks  the meet Taylor ( you not a geography major are you ?)

&gt; and a huge thank you to everyone who came from as far away
&gt; as Monterey, Walnut Creek, and Marin to be there!  It's dedication like
&gt; that to the hobby that really makes all the work behind an event worthwhile.
