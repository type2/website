Subject: Re: [VB] Spark Plug Blow Out
Cc: &lt;vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com&gt;

&gt;On the way to the Anderson Show in Crystal Lake yesterday, the spark plug
&gt;blew out of the number two cylinder. I screwed it back in only to have it
&gt;blow out again when the engine started.
&gt;What can I do to repair this short of pulling the engine and replacing the
&gt;head?
&gt;I talked to a couple of guys at the show who say the JB Weld solution works
&gt;pretty good?
&gt;Others told me to get a &quot;heli-coil?&quot; and others mentioned an &quot;insert&quot; but,
&gt;never having to deal with this in the past I'm a little puzzled.


The heli coil is the only good solution.  It's not too expensive and you
can do it with your engine installed.

I always coat the tap with grease so most of the chips come out with the
tap.  If some of the chips fall into the cylinder, no need to worry, they
are soft and will be blown out when you start up the engine.  But try not
to get too many in the cylinder or they may hold a valve open.

When you are screwing in the insert, be sure to put some thread lock on it
so it won't unscrew when you take the sparkplug out.
