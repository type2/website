&gt;The opportunistic thief will have a couple of screwdrivers in his pocket,
&gt;and is unlikely to have an interest in spending time figuring out the tool
&gt;substitutions needed for unique fasteners.  You can't stop a prepared pro,
&gt;but that type probably isn't stealing VW turnsignal lenses.

To some extent I agree - it's just not real smart to try and steal the
lenses from a pair of big oval tail lights.  But if early turn signals
really do go for $80+ a pop, you might find someone willing to really
take the time on it.  At some point, though, it is better for them to
steal your turn signals than steal your whole Bus.

&gt;Back when I designed airliner interiors, it was a prime requirement to
&gt;prevent the passengers from disassembling the aircraft in flight.

Far Side: &quot;wings stay on/wings fall off&quot;

&gt;We used a fastener called a &quot;tri-wing&quot; head that pretty much could not
&gt;be removed without the proper tool.

http://www.tamperproof_dot_com/products.html has this and other popular
&quot;security&quot; screws.

I still stand by my statement: With a Dremel tool and a cut-off wheel,
_everything_ takes a flat-blade screwdriver.  :)
