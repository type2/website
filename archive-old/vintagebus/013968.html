Hello Everyone,
Just a short update on the truck.... last week finally
got the blinkers to work, and the hazards (is the
rears the only one supposed to blink when the hazards
are on?) Got the body work almost finished, still
dreadin doin the gates tho, havent found anyone around
here that can build the channels.... Tomorrow the
engine comes out for a complete tune up _at_ paint.
Gettin ready to sandblast the whole under side to get
it ready for paint too... hopefully we can have it all
done by sunday night.
Now for a shameless FS plug...
Im sellin the 72 B*g and/or camper to finance the S/C
effort. If you, or if you know of anyone, thats is
lookin for one, its up on thesamba_dot_com in the T1 photo
adds.... Its the the same rig Rick Taylor(I think)
spoke of on the Josh Rogers campout post.... If nothin
else, check it out:)
Later,
