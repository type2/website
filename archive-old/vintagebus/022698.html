It's A *california* thing.  And buses breed when you're not looking.  I had
one nice bus, everything is cool, the next thing I know, I have 3 more.  I
kept one of the litter, gave one away, and the runt didn't make it.  I
normally don't let the westy and the panel next to each other, for fear
that they'll breed!
