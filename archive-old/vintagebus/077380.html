Subject: distributer thingie.

hey fellow dubbers,
  i am in the process of putting my engine back together and have once again run into a problem, i lost the distributer rin thingie. what i am talkin about is the bracket thingie that is held onto the case by a nut and goes around the distributer. i know its confusing. i am using a 009. distributer on my 1600cc single port. do i need this bracket ring thingie? or will i be ok without it? thanks in advance, just tryin to get my bus rollin before april.
