Subject: RE: [VB] N.A.D.A.


Some of the numbers seem rather arbitrary.  For example station wagons for
'70. '71, and '72 are priced thus (average value for each)

1970 $5725
1971 $5825
1972 $5925

Considering the changes that occured in these years, merely adding $100 to
each value doesn't wash.  Folks pay a lot more for a '71 with its disk
brakes than they would for a '70, and the '72, lacking an engine access
hatch, is somewhat less desirable.  We really need experts like Jerry
working with these folks to straighten them out.
