Subject: Re: What shocks do you prefer

I have KYB GR-2's on my 65, along with Yokohama truck tires (ie, proper 
load range) and man is it stiff, but I really like it.  Mainly because 
I've driven way too many mushy Type 2s.  Road construction and speed 
bumps are a pain -- I can get air on the latter when unladen unless I 
pretty much slow to a roll.  But I like having the stiffness for loads, 
dirt roads, and driving thru the woods, and on pavement it's nice to 
have a (relatively speaking) slotcar-ish suspension &amp; wheels.  (1600sp 
engine, no mods.)

Another advantage is that when I drive my 65 Type 1 instead, it feels 
like a luxury-car ride. ;-)

YMMV,
Joe Clark
