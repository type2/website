Hello everyone!
  My new to me Crew Cab has an IRS bug tranny in it. I haven't taken it up
many big hills, but so far I like the gear ratio. Is this comparable to a
freeway flier? I know someone is going to ask what year of car it came out
of, but I can't answer that just yet. Hoping you all will tell me they are
all pretty much the same. By the way I am running a 1600 dual port with
Kadrons, electronic ignition, and a header. The truck cruises effortlessly
at 65-70mph and I've run it up to 80-85mph.(speedo on 0 with a friend pacing
me) I am running 195/60 15s on the rear and 195/50s on the front. Is anyone
out there running  a similar combo? Also how can I get my speedo corrected
without going to stock size tires? Thanks once again list!
