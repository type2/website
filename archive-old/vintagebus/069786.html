Subject: Re: [VB] side scoops any opinions

Yeah, some people didn't like the holes drilled to
mount scoops, but if you look carefully at my bus,
there are quite a few holes already.  

Absolutely no help w/ oil temps, but I think my heads
are slightly cooler, 'cause my valves don't tighten up
so fast.  Of course, I really push the h_at_ll out of my
camper.  Wait'll you see my new trailer at Red Barn.

PS  I won the turnkey raffle engine at Corona de
Tucson.  Thanks all those who didn't show because of
bad weather!
