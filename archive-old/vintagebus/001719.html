Sunday morning, after the sun begins it's climb into the sky of a new day, I
am finally able to get a little sleep.  The previous nights temperatures had
only allowed me to lay in my bus shivering all night long.  Man, if this
wasn't justification for the need of a 'co-pilot' I don't know what is!
&lt;grin&gt;  It wasn't long before I heard some knocking on the window of my bus.
I awoke, briefly, only to drop in and out of sleep  for the next hour or so.
When I finally was able to drag myself out of bed, it was about 9:30 or so.
I got about 3 hours of sleep... it was going to be a long day...

It was still a bit chilly outside, even thought the sun was shinning
brightly... the wind was really picking up too from the previous days..   I
hoped it wouldn't turn out to be a headwind.   I made a quick breakfast out
of some orange juice, kiwi fruits and a bagel, and set off to see who was
still around for the day.  Most everybody had left for the show in
Farmington, but a few still remained.  Jamie, John, and most of the
stink-foot encampment were around, and a few other people I had met the
night before, but couldn't remember their names.  Turns out I missed some
excitement when the Hot Deluxe-Bus Vixens left...  seems they impressed all
their male admirers when they pulled out, by laying a nice big scratch in
the gravel.

As it would turn out, John Yust and I would be heading the same way for the
better part of the day, and even though I would be driving considerably
slower than he, John decided to caravan along with me as far as Candler.
With that deal worked out, I set about breaking camp.  The tent came down
easily, however I had some trouble figuring out how to fold it up properly
to fit it back in to its storage bag.  I tossed my trash, stowed everything
away in the bus, and by about 11:30, John and I pulled out of Hagen-Stone
park.  Our progress was momentarily impeded when we had to stop to let a
family of ducks waddle across the road though (nature!  Ooohhhhh...) and we
were on our way!

We would have to go north through Greensboroug first, then turn west onto
40.  The ride north was fairly uneventful, even if the wind was quite
brutal.  The worst part was that it was then that I realized I would be
fighting a pretty strong  headwind for the drive.  When we finally did make
the turn West, I was really hurting!  It took all the old bus had just to
keep it up around 55.  Plus the fact that we were climbing up the Eastern
Continental Divide didn't help much either.  We pushed on though, and I must
commend John on his patience in staying behind me, because I know at any
time he could have just put the hammer down on that balanced, blueprinted,
dual-carbed 1600 of his and left me in a blaze of asphalt and H-4 smoke.  Oh
well, at least he would be getting really good mileage for this trip. &lt;grin&gt;

About an hour into the drive, it began to cloud up a bit, and it got a a bit
colder that it was even before...  I had all the windows closed, a sweater
on, and my baja, and I was still feeling a bit chilly!  (WHY didn't I hook
up the heat before this trip!  ARRGH!!).  We pulled off at a rest stop to
cool off my motor, for a bit, and it was there in the middle of North
Carolina, John ran into a couple from his own town in Tennessee!  They had
wandered over to admire the busses, and got into a conversation with John
over his &quot;FURTHER&quot; license plates. (relates back to a story from the &quot;Whole
Earth Catalog&quot; in which a writer drives cross-country in a red and white 21
window deluxe to receive his Pulitzer Prize I believe.  I'm  not sure of the
details.. I'm too young to remember such things &lt;grin&gt;).  So anyway, that
was pretty freaky, and after pondering the karma of the incident, John and I
were back on the road.

I was getting pretty worried about my bus after a while...  The heads were
running about 550 on the hills, and only cooling off to about 500, my oil
was running about 270, and the pressure was down about 10 pounds from where
it normally runs...  probably from the heat.  And to make matters worse,
even though you're climbing some pretty viscous hills on this stretch of 40,
there are very few &quot;truck lanes&quot; to pull into to let traffic by.  And to
make matters even worse than that, there is a lot of construction going on
so there is no shoulder in a lot of areas.  When driving my bus through
mountains, I pretty much take on Italian driving habits (whatever is behind
you does not matter) so I can't say for certain what it was like behind me,
but I bet I had traffic jammed up pretty good for a while.  Hey, when I'm
driving my bus, I'd just assume not worry myself with other people.. I'm
driving my bus dammit!  I don't need the added stress..  It's kinda like the
'Joo-Janta 2000 Peril Sensitive Sunglasses' from &quot;the Hitchhikers Guide to
the Galaxy&quot; by Douglas Adams...  Sunglasses which instantly turn black at
the slightest hint of danger, thus preventing you from seeing anything which
might alarm you.  Valium for the mind.. I don't care to know how badly I'm
screwing up everyone else's day by driving my bus slowly on the highway..

It was rough, slow, windy travelling.  There were times I was down to about
35mph going up those hills.  When we finally crossed the Continental Divide,
things got a bit better.  At least there were some good downhill portions to
allow the motor to cool, and me to work up some speed for the next hill.  I
was still very worried about my motor though.  I knew at these temperatures,
at any moment I could burn a hole  in a piston, drop a valve, or worse
without warning.   I was genuinely concerned about getting all the way home.
When we stopped for gas about 50 miles shy of Asheville, I really got
steamed when I found I was only getting about 17mpg.  When I get less than
20, I'm pissed.  I'm used to getting high 20's in my busses, and mid 30's in
my bug! This was ridiculous!

We headed out again, humming down the road at a leisurely 50-55mph.  Part of
my plans for the trip was to ride up to the Mount Pisgah in on the Blue
Ridge Parkway to get a new sticker for my bus.  Last year I had bought a
'Top of the Parkway&quot; sticker, but somehow lost it on the way home...  must
have fallen out a rust hole somewhere...  But it was already going on 3PM,
and Neil said he would be back from Farmington by then.  I stayed on the
highway all the way to the Canton exit, forgoing the ride to the parkway for
later.. perhaps tomorrow.   As I slowed on the exit ramp, John sped by,
giving a hearty wave as he passed... fare ye well bus traveler... we shall
meet again..

It was only a few miles from the highway to Neil's house.  Cross the state
highway, turn at the church, turn into a subdivision up a GIANT hill, and
your there...  just don't try it at night if you don't know the street names
like me &lt;grin&gt;.  Neil's house is nestled into the side of a mountain valley
in Candler...  just outside of Asheville.  Farmland, cattle pastures, and
the Pisgah mountain range set the scenery.  It is a very beautiful place.
As I pulled in to the driveway, I could see I had beaten Neil home.  Mary
Kay was nowhere to be found either.  I just pulled my bus off into the yard
and found myself a nice level camping spot.  (as is customary.. I don't
driving off into just anybody's yard!)  I hoped into the back of the bus,
made out my bed, popped the hatch, and laid back to watch the clouds roll
by.  The air is so crisp here, and the sky so blue...  with light,
strato-sirrus clouds wisping through the sky.  There has just always been
something about this place that puts me at ease. I feel very fortunate to
have been able to make the trip here this year. It wasn't long before I was
in a deep sleep, making up for the night before.

It was only about 30 minutes later when I awoke to a knocking on the
window..  It was Mary Kay, back from the grocery store.  I must have just
missed her when I arrived...   I was enlisted to helping bring in the
groceries and putting a few things away, as Mary Kay and I caught each other
up on things back west and things here in Asheville.  Mary Kay set about
making some vegetarian chili, while I took a nice hot shower... Yowsa!  The
first in days!  You see, even though the facilities were quite nice at the
camp-ground, I seem to have this public facility phobia of sorts...  I don't
even like public rest rooms.  &quot;Pee Fright&quot; I think most people call it.  I
never even used a public rest room until I was like 18 years old!  Call me
crazy, but that's just the way things are!  LOL  Man, that was one nice
shower, with the 'singing nozzle' and the trick toilet and all.. but I've
stayed at Neil's house for nearly 5 years running now, so I had all the
tricks to their bathroom worked out! Hahaha...  and, this year, for the 1st
time ever,  I DID NOT forget my bottle of shampoo in there!  I was so proud
of myself...

When I got out, that home cookin' sure smelled great!  My stomach was
rumbling already! Mary Kay had forgotten to get this vegetable matter meat
substitute thing from the store, so I volunteered to run to the grocery for
some.  It was totally unnecessary, but I just used it as an excuse to run
around Candler for a bit.  I passed the Miami Café, previously the site of
the pre-Blue Ridge campout breakfast, and finally arrived at the Food Lion.
It took some searching to find the vegetarian stuff, but I did, and when I
came out of the store, I saw the reason I always come this way every year.
Where else in this country can you walk out of the local grocery store, and
be confronted with the site of clouds rolling over mountain tops, down into
valleys, and 'feel' your sheer altitude over sea level?  Man, I love this
town!

Neil still wasn't home when I got back, but Mary Kay was ready to eat
anyway.  Some fine vegetarian chili was dished out (into hand-made bowls of
course), and WOW what a treat!  May Kay sure like to make things spicy, and
this was no exception.  I don't think my sinuses have ever been clearer than
they were while eating that chili!  And not being a big fan of vegetarian
dishes myself, you know I'm serious when I say this stuff was great!  Right
about the time we were finishing up our 1st bowl, Neil, Mitch, George, and a
couple from Tennessee with a new-born baby arrived from the Farmington show.
The party was starting then baby!  Yeah, right...

Really, all we did was talk about all things we saw and did over the
weekend.  Neil filed in Mary Kay on what went on, and how much progress
being made with the bus and all.  We watched a few &quot;bootleg&quot; videos I had
taken on the trip (the subject of which shall NEVER be revealed to anyone!
LOL) and some video of  Kelly's shop shot by Mitch.  A few beers were
enjoyed, Neil showed off some of his photography to me, and tried to impress
me with his new Macintosh computer (he did not succeed &lt;grin&gt;), and finally
busted out with the REAL treasure.  Some antique camera flash outfit, with
absolutely PERFECT surgical-grade chroming on the reflectors, complete with
un-spent original bulbs!  WOW   The best part though was that one of these
flashes was attached to a mint condition Roleiflex TLR camera, circa 1944.
Zoiks!  I'd sell a kidney for that unit!  So, with me being sufficiently
taunted with kewl stuff, it was time to hit the sack.  Mitch headed for
home, while George and the Tenn. Couple headed for the comfort of their
campers.  I had the honor of sleeping inside on the futon for the night.

We sure were a talkative bunch, so it took a while to get everyone separated
long enough to finally actually go to bed.   But, we finally did, and it
only took about 5 seconds for me to be out like  light...  Highly unusual as
anyone who knows me knows.. I usually toss and turn hours.  It's that cool
mountain air I tell ya!  It has a strange effect on me...

Next installment- The final chapter! The journey home!  ( I could drag this
out more, but folks have been quoting lines from  &quot;Fear and Loathing in Las
Vegas&quot; at me: &quot;Just... finish... the.... F_at_#$ing... STORY!!!!)
