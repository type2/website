Every time I list an item on ebay, I get a &quot;What's your reserve?&quot; message
from somebody. I never respond - there's only one way to find out.

Well, I won't presume to speak for Thom, but in my opinion, it's sort of
rude to ask publically what someone's reserve price is.

&gt;It would sort of defeat the purpose of him having a *reserve* price auction
&gt;if he told the list his reserve, don't ya think?
