Not even sure if anybody out there knew there was a SOTO show today down
in the San Diego area, but there was, if you can call it a show.   I
happened to be down in the area visiting my parents, so I decided to
drive by.  They might have had something in the swap I needed.

Well, as I drove up at about 11 am, I thought that I must have got the
dates wrong...where was everyone?  As I got closer, I saw 3 maybe 5
busses....that was it!!  There was a EZ up set up at the entrance
waiting for the throngs that never came.  I didn't even bother to
stop...it was pathetic!  I think this signals the end of them at least
down here in the South.

Long live OCTO!

Steve
