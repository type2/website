Subject: Re: [VB]gas heaters, but not J tubes

When the stock heat wasn't hooked up, I had the gas heater on full blast all the time on that trip.

with the stock heat hooked up and on all the way, the engine pumped a nice amount of heat into the bus, the engine being fully warmed up.  This means I only used the gas heater now and then, so the amount of gas used by the gas heater was much less.  So less gas total was used with the stoock heat hooked up.

I found that with properly hooked up and functioning stock heat, the gas heater was good for warming the bus up when you first start up (70 degrees in a minute, instant defog of ALL windows, very nice) and until the engine is warmed up.  Then it was only useful if the outside temp is below freezing.   VW did call it an *auxilliary* heater.

  When running around town I just am getting the good heat at about when I get to where I'm going, so I'd like to get an eberspacher in my bus.  But the 65 has great stock heat once the engine's warmed up.  The 61 (with smaller heat tube and more rust holes/drafts doesn't have great heat.
