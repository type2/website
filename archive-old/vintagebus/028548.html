There was only 4 bus's guys! 2 were 53's and 2 were 54's
                                        How can you say there were too
many chestnut brown and swr? So.......If there were a whole row of blue
kombi's would you say&quot;Oh there 's just too much Dove Blue going on
here&quot;? You guys should of have been stoked that we got 4 barndoor
deluxe's together in one spot.Chance's are it will never happen again!!!
