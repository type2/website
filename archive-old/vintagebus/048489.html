Subject: [VB] Any Web Page Professionals out there?
Message-Id: &lt;l03130300b476c94135b7_at_[128.0.0.164]&gt;

Computers and VW's, what is it about those two that bring them together?  I
don't know of any other group of automotive enthusiasts that have so many
people with computers.

If you design and maintain web pages for a living, part time or full time,
I need your help.  Here at school we like to address various careers in
order for the kids to start thinking about their future.  The book that we
use &quot;Occupational Outlook Handbook&quot; put out by the Bureau of Labor
Statistics is good, but does not address those careers that are recently
being developed as the web matures.

Web pages have become a very important part of our economy.  I like to use
the analogy of grassy lawns, many people have them, but not everyone takes
care of their own, thus a new service business is born.

If you would take the time to briefly answer the following survey, it would
help us immensely.  Thank You for your time.
