&lt;&lt; I've found an early bus roof rack with the wood slats. It's about 1/3 the
size of the roof.  It's the typical roof rack you see on restored busses in
the mags. It's in good condition.  &gt;&gt;
Hi Rex,
It depends not only on the condition, but how complete.  Clamps still all
there, and the two tags, does it have the origianal wood?  We have seen them
going for $300.00-500.00 in California.       Eric&amp;Barb
