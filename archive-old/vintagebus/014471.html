A little light bulb lit up in my head saying if I get the 59's cab doors
sealing better the heat would stay in better.

I  noticed the door was not snug against the body when closed.   On the
driver's side a mere loosening of the 3 machine screws holding the striker
plate in, and moving it closer to te center of the bus snugged the door down
against the seals, which were in surprisingly good shape.    A look at the
windows revealed a lack of the little metal doohickey onthe edge of the
stationary glass, so I dug up a good seal and dove blue metal strip and tucked
that in place- this helps against drafts coming in from between the stationary
and sliding pieces on glass.   The  right side one had a bad seal, which I
replaced.

On the passenger side, I also moved the striker plate in a tad, replacing a
missing screw as well.   The door handle itself was not tighten door, and the
two screws in the door jamb holding the mechansims in were awol.     SO I
found the held nuts for the awol screws were also awol, and decided not to
switch the mechansims at this point.  After tightening the handle screws I
found I had to really yank it door open, though it opened easily from the
inside.  After futzing with some slightly bent metal on the edge of the door
by the mechansims, I realised I had to move the outer door handle forward a
tad.  After experimenting with washers I used a couple 10mm OD nuts as
washers, which kept the handle enough forward so it opened easily from the
outside.  I greased the screws, the striker plates, and the mechanism tongues,
both sides.   

Hope this helps retain more heat.

Still unclear on the taillight problem,   they are grounded though.

Clara
