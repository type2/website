Subject: got my first split or upgrade to 12V

well i have been running 6V on my '65. i guess i ended up restoring it as
well...because first the pulley went on it, then the generator, then the
starter, the headlights are never bright enough. granted the generator
probably went because i installed the wrong pulley, and i screwed the
starter up...and i was on the road when the generator went so no time to
really evaluate my options. and i think i have cleaned every connection
possible to brighten my headlights, and even taken the headlight switch
apart. all good things to do regardless of voltage...

but if i were to do it over i would change to 12V. everything is more
difficult with 6V. I like the old radio, but i would like to be able to hear
the radio while driving on the highway, it seems like i am doing more work,
and spending more money preserving the 6V, for no real reason...starting in
cold weather is also a little more difficult.

I know you need to change a lot of things to accomodate it, but i would
recommend it. it may be my next big project this year...

good luck with the new one-kevin
