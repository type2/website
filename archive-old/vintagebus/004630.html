&gt; Could be any number of things:
&gt;
&gt; * rear wheel seal - fairly easy to fix
&gt; * seal between redux box halves - a bit more difficult, gotta split
&gt;the box
&gt; * axle boot leaking, dripping along tube to the wheel (a stretch!)A
&gt;



Or the one I ran into a couple of weekends ago. A friend brought by his
'new' 67 Westy to fix the leaking redux thing. The axle nut was about .004
away from the drum with the cotter pin installed in it. No real signs of
fretting, I don't think it was driven much this way from the looks of it.
Had a wicked pull when you hit the brakes, don't you know. Probably could
have tightened it down and stopped the leak. Had to pull it apart to clean
the goobers out of the drums and backing plates, replace the seal, and
change the brake shoes (both sides, of course). Couple hours of dirty work,
bus is so happy.

Never attempt to teach a pig to sing, it wastes your time and annoys the
pig.
