Subject: Re: [VB] Interior handles

no, deluxes used the same escutcheons as non deluxes.    plastic in front, 
chrome in back.  Though I think i've have seen pics where people have used rear 
chrome ones in the front.

the earlier buses with the earlier inner handles (~60 &amp; earlier) which had 
front inner handles chrome for all models, in the front used black rings for 
commercials, and white for passenger models (or maybe only white for deluxe).   
the front rings were a different shape.. think they were bug parts like the 
earlier inner handles.
The early cargo door handles were chromed for most models, I think only panel 
vans had non chromed inner handles.  They were metal, not plastic.
