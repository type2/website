Yes, you can cut laminated glass.  Or so i've been told by those who
know.;)  How?  I'm not really sure.  You might find it best, though, to
have it done by a glass shop who is skilled, as well as equiped to do
this.  Shouldnt cost very much, just the labor for, what, half an hour?


The reason i know that it can be cut is that we were considering finding a
laminated windshield with the proper curve for the glass portion of a
full-roof sunroof we prelimarily designed for my boss's new beetle. (we
woulda built it, too, except that Stretch wanted 700 bucks to assemble the
frame, .without. contours..)  We would have taken the windshield and
trimmed it to fit.

Perhaps talk tot he guys at a local glass shop for advice, even if you do
intend to cut the glass yourself.


good luck...david
