Subject: Deluxe headliner white rubber seals
Date: Fri, 4 Aug 2000 18:42:14 -0700
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

 Awhile ago someone on the list was looking for the white rubber/plastic
seal that holds the headliner in on later deluxe split buses. Goes on each
side above the windows. Got a pair from a 66 deluxe and they are real nice
and pliable, a little dirty.  Want $30 for the pair plus shipping. Private
email me. They go to 1st to email me.

Attention Kyle: Ran across a stripped 61 23 window  (front)  62 23 window
(back) limo combo. Not fixable though, to stripped and busted up. Made an
offer anyway. Might make a nice match racer with the Westfailure with enough
work. The guy said he would let me know within a week.
