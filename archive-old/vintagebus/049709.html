That they are ugly or worse is beyond dispute,

BUT

I see two points I see in their favour:

1) Volkswagen approved of them -- I have a factory service bulletin with
plans for their construction from sheetmetal.

2) In an unscientific test I conducted, the same engine runs hotter
(dipstick test) in my panelvan without scoops, than it does in my 63
Dormobile, which had scoops fitted when I bought it.

The scoops on the Dormer are to a pattern that looks very close to the VW
plans I have. When I first bought the Dormer I believed the scoops would
restrict airflow and, since I thought they were ugly as well, I planned to
remove them. But the engine test persuaded me otherwise.

FWIW
