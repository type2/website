Pulled a pair of those off of the 65 doublecab that was the ABC raffle bus
two years ago. It came from Oregon originally. Had one of them in the garage
that I pulled off a 66 Kombi I scrapped, also a Northwest delivered bus. So
if you're asking me, they came off of mid 60's buses out of the Northwest.
Ask someone else they'll tell you different.

&gt; Regarding our discussion a couple days ago about offbeat mirrors - what
are these?
