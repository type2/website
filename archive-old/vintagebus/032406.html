Subject: FREE singlecab bed revisited...
Mime-Version: 1.0

Well, the taker for free SC bed section can't come get it, so I'm putting 
it back up here one last time before I junk it.  I hate  to do it, but it 
needs to be gone, and now.  It's basically the forward 2/3 of the bed plus 
the bulkhead and it's in damn nice shape.  It's FREEEEEEE for the taking, 
but you have to come get it.  It's in Sacramento.  I know some other 
listees were interested, but I deleted their messages because I thought it 
was a done deal.
