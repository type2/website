Which reminds me.  In the engine rebuild video being sold by RMMW and
various other parts houses, they very carefully talk about first
running your rebuilt engine out of the vehicle.  They go into great
detail about getting the engine off of the stand and onto the floor,
and about having an oil light and a switch so you can turn it off, and
how not to let it run too long, etc, etc.

What they didn't do, for no obvious reason other than it might have
made things slightly more difficult for their photographically-
challenged camera man, was show *how* they'd attached the starter to
the engine.  For the whole shot, the camera was looking straight at
the back of the engine, from down near the floor, so you couldn't see
anything on the other side of the main shroud.

I've heard various suggestions of attaching the bell housing from an
old transmission, and using that, but it's not real clear to me how
you do that without having the entire transmission housing hanging out
there, or doing an awful lot of cutting through thick metal.

Suggestions?
