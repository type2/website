Subject: [VB] Hydraulic tappets?

&gt;It was mentioned to me that it is possible that the PO might have put
&gt;hydraulic tappets in this beast.  How do I find out?  Maybe they put a
&gt;crazy-lift cam in, and the extra motion is what is making all the noise, but
&gt;short of pulling the engine, yanking the heads off, and sticking an eyestalk
&gt;into the bores, how can I tell?

Pull the oil pump and you will see rivets on a stock camshaft, while a
&quot;crazy&quot; cam will have hex bolts attaching the gear to the camshaft.
