How about Pet Rocks?

Ebay has one for ~10 right now (Item #426244066)
and there is even an entire *Case* of them for $75.  Gadzooks!

But I haven't seen an 'Acres of the Moon' for sale yet... Now here's a trend
that you could get in on the ground floor and beat the rush ;-)

particular
&gt; object takes off in popularity. Pedal cars, Porsches and Harley's come to
&gt; mind, and the same thing has happened with buses. I just wish I could get
&gt; into things early enough to be able to afford what I want and then let the
&gt; prices go nuts.
