Subject: Re: [VB] Q for u Westy dudes

I have never heard of him. Is the color of the canvas correct ? PLF has 
a nice repro for $200.00 with the correct screens if that is your 
preference. I hope to get one from them soon. 
My seal is from Wolfsburg West and it has worked great for the last 5 
years. They even make the grey interior seal that fits pretty well.

Light travels faster than sound. 
This is why some people appear bright until you hear them 
speak.
