Subject: Re: [VB] pulley tin


&gt;
&gt;The host had a stack of about a dozen rear pully shrouds for sale. Being a
&gt;repair shop, I assumed they came off VW's they repaired. VW didn't put
&gt;anything extra into their engines, so what is the function? These cover
&gt;the lower half of the crank pully and humps over the nut.  Safety?
&gt;Cooling?  It's rare to find flaps in a junkyard engine around here.

Do you mean the the tin that covers the the BOTTOM of the pulley, and forms
a 'bucket,' or the bit that arches up over the nut and covers this
'bucket?'

If its the BOTTOM piece, you need it. The top piece... well, how 'correct'
do you like to be?
A man who worked at Chick Iverson's (Sharkey, anyone out there remember
him?) maintains that they were used mainly to remove the fingers of
mechanics - getting yer digits between tin and belt being a mighty good
gotcha. He says standard practice was to remove the tin bit and 'forget' to
put it back on.
He was never sure if it was a cooling bit, a bit to keep things outta the
pulley bucket, or a bit to keep owners from doing their own maintenance!
