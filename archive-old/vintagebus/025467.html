Hello Volks,

I keep my Safaris taped up during the winter. Last weekend (Memorial Day
weekend), I untaped them so I could park my bus next to the Harleys at a
bar and show my bus off a little... Since then, it has showered almost
every day here in SC. My safaris leak (big surprise there), and the
water killed my radio. This is the second radio my leaky safaris have
killed. 

I realize this is probably an unusual, maybe a silly question, but does
anyone have a similar problem, and a solution to go with it?
