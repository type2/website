Subject: bolt size

I apparently lost the lower bolt that holds the right rear shock on.  I pulled
into the garage today to change the oil and noticed it just hanging there.  We
have a local hardware store that has just about every bolt you need in both
metric and standard.  I really don't want to take the other side off and was
wondering if someone knows how long and what size.  TIA.
