Subject: Can't set idle

I have had trouble adjusting the idle on my son's bus since he purchased
it 6K mi ago.  I get it set, and then after driving a little while the
idle slows and frequently stalls.  I have checked engine adjustments and
looked for leaks.  The engine is recently rebuilt (1600), with what
looks like a new carb (34 Pict 3).  
 
At this time, I have the idle screw all the way out.  It idles at about
1,200 RPM, and then periodically slows to 800 (or stalls).  I have also
tried adjusting the volume, according to LIBRARY instructions, but it
doesn't respond well to adjustment.  I also have always had trouble
timing the engine properly.  It has a mechanical advance distributor,
and I have to adjust to an advanced position (about 10 degrees extra),
or it will stall. 
 
I'd greatly appreciate any suggestions.
