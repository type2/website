Subject: Brazillian Case - Camshaft Plug?
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Disposition: inline

I'm building a stock 1600 with a brand new Brazillian case. 

Tired of pulling head studs and swapping bearings, I ordered the new
case from Bernie Bergman (from a HotVWs ad -- $350 plus $35 shipping). 
Nothing seemed out of the ordinary until I started preparing to apply
the Permatex seal and close the case.  The case has no V-shaped groove
in the cam shaft bore where the cam plug fits.

I don't see a way to use the old standard plug except by cutting off
the ridge.  Then, it would seem, it would be subject to being pushed out
by oil pressure in the case.

Anyone else encounter this?  Is there a new cam plug without the ridge
on it to fit in the case groove?
