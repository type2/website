&quot;NQ, Welcome to the club! I think your inspiration should be to drive it all 
summer, and with the exception of regular maintenance, not work on it. Just 
drive, drive, drive. Enjoy what you have done so far.&quot;

I AGREE 100%!! My bus is never gonna win a show, i took all the windows out, 
cleaned up some rust, slapped some bondo in a few small dings, sanded her 
smooth and painted. bottom will be finished soon. i just want to have a nice 
shiny driver. thats all that matters. in a few years when i got $10,000 to 
spend, ill buy an original paint westy or something that ronnie found in 
grandma willys pole barn. i also agree that it's Thom's fault you feel 
disgrunteled ;) he sets an impossible standard for us all :P
later,
