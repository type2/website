Subject: RE: [VB] Heat pipe question, '61 bus

They act as a buffer between turbulent flow and steady state flow.  or what
ever those fluid dynamics dudes call it.   anything to smooooth it out.

What is the purpose of the two units, approximately 7&quot; in length that attach
to the two heat pipes just before it turns into one pipe.  They are after
the heater boxes and bellows connectors. Is there a special purpose to
these?  Thanks.
