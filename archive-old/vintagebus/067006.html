Subject: 9 prong box electrical ?

Theres a great article ibn the Library by Matt Roberds about how to use
standard flasher relays to by-pass a bad 9 prong box.  I followed this
procedure for an old bus I had, and it worked great.  However, I tried to
follow it today while work on an old 66 bug I have and I noticed that the
procedure will have to be a little different for a bug because nothing is
connected to the 54f and 54 terminals of the relay in a bug. So does anyone
know of the bug procedure for this. I'm sure its very similiar and I should be
able to figure it out myself, but I really don't want to fry anything,
electricals is not my strong point! Matt, can you direct on the bug version
perhaps? Anyone?

Peace, John Baker
