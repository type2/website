&lt;&lt; Hello everyone,

I have a question about light switches.  My bus came with some non-vw switch
that was cobbled together with lots of wiring.  
I checked my parts manual (thanks steven howell), and there is only one part
# listed for the light switch......(snip)

 When I find a switch, do I need
one with screw terminals, or with pull tab terminals, or is there a difference?

VWs switched to push on terminals in late 60 or early 61, when they changed the fuse box.  Anyway, yours came with push on, so get yourself a push on connection lightswitch. Sure, the parts list prolly shows only the push on kind, but that's cause they superceded the old school screw on terminal kind.  If you needed a different kind for a euro spec bus, they would show it.  Attach the wires a la wiring diagram.  It really isn't that bad.  Good idea to get rid of the mess someone put in there.
