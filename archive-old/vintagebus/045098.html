 (1) Of those who have fitted later bay tanks has anyone
 used the bay sender and a gauge (what gauge suits?) to 
 get a working fuel gauge with this setup?  (no I'm
 not going to hack the dash for the gauge....8-))).  
 ----------------------------
YOU SHOULD USE THE BAY SENDER WITH THE BAY TANK.  iF YOU USE A SPLITTY SENDER 
IT DOES NOT READ THE LAST ABOUT 5GALS OF THE TANK.  oops sorry about caps.   
You can use a regular bus gas guage.   if your bus is pre gas guage perhaps 
consider finding and optional (ambulance)  guage that reads FULL to EMPTY 
(can be indifferent languages).  you can mount it in a guage holder like oil 
pressure etc guages.

 (2) The bus has a small nut tranny and 36hp motor
 and the plan is to have a 'driver' config and an 'original'
 config for special occasions.  
 
 I could fit a big nut tranny and a 1600-1776 single port
 for the driver config but that a lot more work then to go back to
 the 'original' config (not as easy as an engine swap). 
 
 Will a later 3.88 bug R&amp;P go in the  tranny reasonably 
 painlessly and work with the existing ratios to be nicely driveable 
 with a sought top speed of 60 mph with the early reduction boxes? 
 ....opinions sought........
  &gt;&gt;
yes you can fit the early boxes on the 3.88 set up for bus tranny.  the boxes 
bolt on the same little or small nut.  if youdo go to big nut you should 
change the front suspension to the later style.   me myself I like split case 
trannies.
