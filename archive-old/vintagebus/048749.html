Subject: '59 Kombi update.....lights

So my job at the moment is to get all the electrical bits worked out 
on my '59 Kombi. PO had converted it to 12 volts, except wiper motor 
and horn.

It's really a tedious job not only getting things back together after 
tearing them out for paint and such, but working out all the old worn 
out neglected parts and DPO hack jobs. I AM making good progress 
though. Wiring is something I've done my whole life, so it's not as 
big of a deal to me. I'd love to make myself a whole new harness for 
the bus, but it just doesn't seem to make sense right now since with 
a little repair what's there works fine.

I did lose the the one original tailight housing I had. The other had 
already been replaced by a standard &quot;trailer&quot; tailight housing. My 
original just gave up the ghost and went dead. I pulled it out and of 
course it was all burned up and falling apart from years of hard 
life. I set it in my parts bin to maybe work on later. I just went 
and bought a &quot;trailer&quot; housing that matched the other side. With the 
orignal chrome rings and plastic repro lenses on the outside, you'd 
never know anyway. This is really a good solution for someone short 
on cash or who needs something quick/in an emergency. Walmart or just 
about any chain auto parts store will have 'em. You just take the 
lense off and mount the houseing up in place of your old one. No 
sweat. Quick, easy, cheap, works, and you can't tell from the outside 
of the bus.

  My wiper motor (which is 6 volt) doesn't seem to be working for 
whatever reason. I never ran it more than a second on the 12 volts 
back when I originally got the bus. So it's probably a wiring issue. 
Regardless, I've got one of those wiper motor set-ups from a '65 I 
could put in if I can't get er going. It'll drop in there....right?

I also picked up lots of little electrical bits, connectors, bulbs, 
ect. since my stash was pretty much used up. I hope to finish most of 
it up today or tommarrow. We'll see.
