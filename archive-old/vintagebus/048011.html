&lt;&lt;  Just curious because I've thrown out heads that had those small cracks. &gt;&gt;
Hi Everett.
Depends!  Are they Okrasa heads, KDF or later 25 HP?  If they are then they 
might be worth the $ to have them welded.  If they are 36, 40HP, or later 
stocker heads then it might not be worth spending about $30.00+ for each head 
to fix them when you can get good used heads of these for $5-10.00 each in 
used rebuildable non-cracked condition.  Plus you have to find a welder that 
knows better than just welding over the crack/s!  To do this the crack in the 
head has to be ground out to a slot wide enough to allow the welding to 
completely remelt the head and the new aluminum material together.  If you 
are going dual port stock heads do yourself a favor and get the thicker cast 
after market ones!
