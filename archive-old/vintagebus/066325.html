Subject: RE: [VB] color of pedal pan

  I just went out and looked at all of the ones I have and they ALL appear
to be gray primer, most of the primer is gone and has turned to surface rust
though.  lots of pans post 55 to 67 and one pre 55 thats black?

Hi All,

Would anyone know the correct color of the pedal pan on a 59 bus? 

... i.e. primer, black, or the color of the bus?
