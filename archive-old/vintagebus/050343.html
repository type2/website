Subject: Re:fuel pressure regulator &amp; electric choke?

&gt;elec fuel pumps are no good for carbs with OUT a pressure regulator. put on
&gt;a mech, or get the reg and turn it down to 1-3 psi.

Thanks for this tip Craig. I went and bought one as well as all new fuel
line and filter. Carb ran MUCH smoother and no more leaky gas. Only thing
is I installed the regulator in the engine bay and now feel uncomfertable
with it there. I'm gonna move it to a nice non-traumatizing place under the
bus instead. That way if it fails it won't spurt gas all over the hot
engine.

I'm still working out the idle speed, choke, and timing. I'm gonna adjust
the valves today and try to get it nailed a little better. Engine is
running better and better.

How do you set the electric choke on a 34-pict 3?
