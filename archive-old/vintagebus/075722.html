I beg to differ! ;-) First, last, whatever, I personally will not hold the
clutch down for any amount of time, for anyone's convenience. When the
light turns green, I engage and go in my own time, at a rate that my bus
is comfortable with. Anyone behind me that doesn't like that, is cordially
welcomed to pass when they can.

I don't believe that holding the clutch in for any length of time is
productive for the clutch assembly. Maybe I'm just conservative about
these things... ;-P
