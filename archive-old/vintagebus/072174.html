&gt; I have a friend who wants to give me a set of 205 75R15's .  How much will 
&gt; these benefit me over my 165's that I have now?

Hi Tom,
Well the 205/75s are as close to stock diameter as possible today, but will 
not fit in the lower tighter width pre-late 1962 rear wheel wells.  This will 
result in lower RPMs at the same MPHs than with 165s, which in turn will help 
extend engine lifespan, MPG, if you have been over RPMing your engine.  Unless 
the 205s are really cheaply made they should be way higher load rating 
(Hopefully at least 1525 Lbs. which is the bus tire minimum tire load rating!!!!!) 
than the 1200 Lbs or less of the 165s.  This will greatly reduce automatic lane 
changes due to side winds or the bow wave from a passing semi!!!
