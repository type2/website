Subject: ignition wiring

Hi Folks,
Is there an easy way to remove the ignition switch on a 60 DC?
I had it stolen, they yanked the wires, hot wired it and went for a ride.  I
have it back now, but need to re-do the ignition wires.
I have seen the diagram, but can not work behind the odometer crown.

Any suggestions?

Make it a Great Day!!
