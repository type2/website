Subject: Hard to open pop outs

My pop outs are very hard to open. I have spoken with a lot of other people
in the UK and most others have the same problem but noone has a perfect
solution to fix it.  Suggested have been window rubber lubricant (which I
think contains silicone) or petroleum jelly, however other people have said
not to use these as they damage paintwork.  Has anyone got any good ideas on
how to make it easier.  It could just be the rubbers that are in normal
supply over here just aren't very good and in the US you don't have the
problem, if so I will have to try and get some!

Thanks
Paul
