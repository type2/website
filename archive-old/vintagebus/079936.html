Subject: stupid things

I decided to share two recent bus events for me:

Last week I was driving home from work early. I was going to coach
soccer and since this was the first day of practice I really needed to
be there early. My path home takes me over a good size hill. After the
4 way stop I can pretty much cruise down hill, but this time something
seemed amiss. The engine was struggling to keep running and on the way
down finally died. I knew of a good place to turn off at the bottom so
I turned the key to off and coasted down. Well when I pulled in I gave
the wife a call to let her know I was gonna be late. Poped the engine
lid and noticed that the fuel filter was bone dry. Dangit, one of the
only spare parts I don't carry w/ me is a fuel pump. So as I'm trying
to figure out the logistics of still making it to soccer, get a fuel
pump and get a ride home I decide to pull the fuel pump. No big deal,
just wanted to make sure it isn't the plunger or anything like that.
As I pull off the pump the lever falls right out? WTF? Then I notice
that the pivot pin has fallen out. I spend a few minutes trying to get
it back in, but can't. I default next to a bolt of the correct
diameter and as my mother-in-law shows up to give me a ride, the bus
roars to life :) Always fun to fix something on the side of the road.

So for the past few days I could have sworn that I could near some new
sounds coming from the passenger compartment. It really sounded like
extra wind/road noise, but I coulnd't really find it. Well this
morning I found it! While driving to work a route I normally do not
take in the rain. Made a hard left and heard the noise get real loud.
Turned around to see both my cargo doors open. Fortunately I didn't
lose anything (even from the spice rack). Turned into a driveway and
closed them (correctly) and went on my merry way.
