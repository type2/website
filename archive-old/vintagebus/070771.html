Subject: Brake MC clarification?

So is it true that a later and cheaper master cylinder can be fitted with an
adaptor to a 68 - 70 Type 2 without problems?
If so this is good news as the 68 to 70 master cylinders are expensive. I
paid over $100 ten years ago.

How much is the adaptor or does it have to be taken from a later Type 2?

By the way I'm pretty sure the first Type 2 discs were 71 not 72 as someone
stated. In Muir's book he discusses the annual Type 2 changes but overlooks
71 disc brakes.
