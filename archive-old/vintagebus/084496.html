Hi Harry,

I did not use POR-15, it was Master-Series (masterseriesct_dot_com). I started
with their silver primer-two coats, then one coat of their high gloss top
coat. I made sure the temps were above the rating on the can...pretty close
to it but above. So hopefully the paint will adhere...it sure is sticking to
my wrist pretty good. As for the brushes-they were dissolving in chunks,
just losing their rigidity...sometimes shrinking a little bit.

I'd be concerned about the working temperature of the undercoating. Did you
use POR15?  I can't remember if it's affected by temp. 

I've used the cheap &quot;chip&quot; brushes from Harbor Fright with POR15 and they
held  up pretty good. Did the foam dissolve into the undercoating? You're
adding an ingredient! 

My son had the black wrist syndrome when I saw him at Thanksgiving. He's
working on a BMW 2002.

&gt; -do it in warmer weather, my hands were pretty damn cold
&gt; -latex gloves work, and do not disintegrate. Unfortunately I got a big
drop
&gt; at the wrist, and didn't realize it. So black wrist for a few days...it
&gt; doesn't really wash off.
&gt; -buy lots of foam brushes, as they disintegrate rather quickly. I probably
&gt; used about 20.
