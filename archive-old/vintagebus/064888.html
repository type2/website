Subject: Re: [VB] Where does the other end of the oil bath cleaner hose
  go?

Bottom side, I guess that would be the one that goes
from the oil filler to the filter, kind of like a
breather. The photo doesn't show ththe pre-heater tube
that runs from the &quot;mouth &quot; of the air cleaner through
the engine tin and down to your 3-4 head.
