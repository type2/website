Wouldn't it be better to use an adjustable timing light and time to 27º total advance? Especially for an engine you're unsure about? Don't ask me how, as I've been doing it statically for years, but that's just what I've heard.

Jon, I'm also a bit cornfused on the timing of my engine, and was thinking about asking someone in SVIIs if they could bring an adjustable light to the meeting Friday and maybe quickly time our engines in the parking lot.

&gt; Im just a little confused.  dont understand how I can build an engine but
&gt; be confused on the timeing.  If I am at 10 btdc and I get pinging going
&gt; up a long hill should I advance or retard the timeing?   Is advancing the
&gt; timeing going closer to tdc.  This is a HO engine case with stock VW
&gt; distrib.  Should timing be at 10 ar 7and a half btdc.   Hope this makes
&gt; sensi.......jon
