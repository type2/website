Subject: Trip Report -no busses :-(

Hi all,
    I am back from a good 2500+ mile journey in the Mercury w/ 1 Greyhound, 
7 Cats and my wife.  Wasn't allowed to take the Sundial this time due to my 
wife needing the car in FL.  Well we started out in Lemoore, CA on Sat the 
18th took 99S to 58E and on to I-40 in Barstow.  We stayed on I-40 and made 
it to Gracemont, OK in about 18hrs averaging about 20mpg and 100 mph.  
Stayed at my mothers for a couple of days and got back on I-40.  All my 
speeding caught up with me in Arkanasas when I got pulled over and issued a 
ticket for going 84 in a 70 zone, nice cop, I was really going about 98 when 
I saw him,  Still haven't found out how much that ones gonna cost me, call 
and Arkansas clerk didn't have the ticket yet wouldn't give me an estimate.  
On to Memphis where we got on 55S to New Orleans.  At New Orleans we found  
I-10 and drove on to Tallahassee with quick stop off to see the USS Alabama 
in Mobile.  At Tallahassee we got on US19S and took that all the way to Port 
Richey (near Tampa).  Arrived in Port Richey early Wed morning.  Well, what 
gives the only bus I saw on the entire trip was a yellow standard or Kombi 
being used as a sign at a salvage yard in AZ or maybe NM off I-40.  Saw 
quite a few bays in FL.  I am a bit disapointed.  I picked up a new impact 
wrench from my Brother-in-law in OK and had some fun explaining what it was 
to aiport security this morning.  Finally someone who spoke fluent english 
and knew what it was let me throught to my flight back to CA.  Well, glad to 
be back in CA.  Forced to use my sundial as a daily driver, she'll hold up.  
It has been nice to not even look at a computer till today.  Back to work  
My plane is about to land and they are looking at me like my lap-top is 
going to cause the plane to burst into flames.
