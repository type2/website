Subject: swaping 67 master cylinder
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com


       i need some info on swaping my 67 mc for an earlier one. on the back 
side of the 67 master cylinder there is an accordian type gasket that is torn 
up and brake fluid is leaking out. is this piece supposed to have break fluid 
in it, i thought it was just a dust guard. i have a replacement master 
cylinder plus the adapter that they sell in california imports. to add to 
this my front right brake is not working as well as the others and ive tried 
adjusting it a few times. my question is what parts will i need to do the 
swap to an earlier mc. i have the mc and adapter but need the resivore and 
what else?
