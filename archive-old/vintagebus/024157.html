&lt;&lt; As far as quality of rubber, I'm not all that impressed with German 
rubber. 
  Fuel lines that I replace every two years generally have cracks in their 
 ends, where the SAE lines I put in my C*evy 5 years ago look fine.&gt;&gt;
  We have seen several times in American automobiles when thier fuel line 
 suddenly  has a pin hole crack without warning.  Most of the time around the 
 center of the length.  We rather have a fuel line that gives you a warning 
at 
 it's ends that it is time to replace or fry!

Just had the same experience with my 70 bug when I replaced the engine.  When 
I hooked the gas line back up using USlines that were about 6 mos old and not 
cracked  around the fuel line, I smeled gas and had a BIG hole when the 
pressure of the pump hit it.  Luckily it was under the car and there was no 
fire, just a more cautious owner.
