Subject: Mystery M code, paint code &amp; NW Vint meet
Date: Mon, 20 Jul 1998 17:52:32 -0700

Does any one have any idea what M 358 might be? (It is on my Beetle)
I've looked over all of my books and the internet and there seems to be
a giant hole of missing M codes which start from 320 to about 410.
Hmmm... seems like I've heard that one before.  

Oh yeah, My paint code for my Bus says *52 36 43 *Sonderlackierung nicht
identifizierbar (special laquer finish not identifiable).  This is
bizzare cause it is painted blue-white/velvet green and that is correct
for 1965 kombis.
All I know is that the blue-white/velvet green combination is ONE year
only for 1965 model year.  From April 64 to April 65.  Maybe that is the
reason for the paint code crazy #s?  Any Ideas out there?

Hey, I'd like to thank the Berg Crew for showing their cars at the NW
Vintage meet.  You guys were great.  Also, I'm glad to have meet so many
fellow list members.   Hope to run into you guys soon or meet some new
faces in the future.  What a great show it was, probably one our best so
far.

Going to the Oregon show this weekend! :-)
