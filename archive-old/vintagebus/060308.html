Subject: RE: [VB] wait a minute


DP engines (as far as unorigninal rebuilt ones, and/or diregarding
minutia) are the same as SP. The heads have two intak erunners instead
of one, and have little boots to attach to th eintake at the carb. DP
engines use 34pict3 carb tradtionally, and were 60hp stock, as opposed
to the 1970 single port 1600 standard of 57.
DP engines also introduced the dogohouse oil cooler, but that can be
retro fitted with correct tin to SP engines, like my 1600SP with
doghouse cooling, flaps, and tstat still there.
DP heads are thought to crack more often, but flow better and produce
more power, especially in high end performance applications, which often
use custom casted and machined DP heads.
For a stock lok and easy maint on a 66, Id go SP, 1600 cc, unless you
want to be absolutley year specifically perfect, or want a HUGE motor.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;as far as installation goes, is a dual port different from
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;a single
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;port? what is the difference?
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
