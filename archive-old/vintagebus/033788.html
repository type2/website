&gt;  I've always bought speed clips from the hardware store.  They don't have 
&gt; the
&gt;  exact size so I pick one a little bit smaller and drill it out a tiny bit.
&gt;  
&gt;  I usually pick up some fiber buffers for over the shafts too - it protects
&gt;  the paint (or primer, haha).  One of my original emblems had the padded
&gt;  washers on there so I figure it's original?
&gt;  
ya- the speed washers from the hardware store.   THe emblem did come with 
little rubber grommets between the emblem and the body- on on each shaft-   I 
have cut these out of unused fuel line.
