Subject: Vuntage plates
To: Vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

For those interested in old plates for your buses (or any Vdubs for that 
matter) here is a list of what I found.  

FLorida
67-68 White
69-70 Green
72 White
73 White G/M (?)
73 White
74 White
75 White

Michigan
65 Blue
68 Yellow
69 Red
70 Yellow
73 Blue

Ohio
66 Red
67 Blue

Pennsylvania
69 Yellow (dealer)

The seller is asking about ten dollars per plate (sorry, no doubles).  With 
about three dollars shipping I can get them to you at about $14.  Some are 
cheaper but I did not write down all the different prices.   (usually between 
7 and 10 dollars).
Email me if you are interested.  Just to let you know, these are not my 
plates.  I am just passing on the info to interested partys.  I have no 
intention of making any money off of these, just thought they may be of 
interest.  I bought one for myself and would also be interested in a 66 
FLorida plate if anyone were to stumble across one at a reasonable price.
