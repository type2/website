&gt;&gt;Hi,
Guess I was'nt too clear on that.  I have one but could not figure out how it 
went on the #4 side.  Your post helps me see I must have the later one.  It 
is NOS and not bent, but I lent it to someone and they lost the PN number 
tag.  &lt;&lt;

&gt;&gt;So I guess I would be looking for the earlier one (the one for the #4 
side). I'd like to have a few extra of both types for future engines.   &gt; Were 
&gt; these only used on 1500s?&lt;&lt;
&gt; 
Hi Steve,
The straight ones as far as we know were used on fresh air 40HP and early 
1500s.  The curved one was a 1500 1965(?) only.  We will take alook through 
our stuff and see what we have, and perhaps others on the list might have 
some.  Eric&amp;Barb
