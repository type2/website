Subject: Binz rear seat stand

Looked at what was I think a post '58 Binz today(rear door opens like a
VW factory DC.  Its said to be the old Dean Lowery shop truck.  The rear
seat was on a &quot;stand&quot; like, but not identical to VW DC's.  It was of
ribbed sheet metal construction like the bulkhead is made of.  Is this
correct for a Binz?  I thought they came with seats that had a frame and
mounted to the floor.  This looked factory, but I'm no Binz expert.  The
mount to the stand and to the back of the cab wall was like my '62 DC.

This truck is very straight and little to no rust.  It has the wrong
rear wheel arches (post 62), and the gates (correct) are in primer. 
I'll try and post pictures soon.  Cool truck, but I still like the
proportions of mine better.

Steve
