Hi Busbarn,
Otay, to do 1,280 watts you would need at least a 100amp alternator (if you 
are running a 12 volt system, double the wattage/amperage on a 6 volt system) 
to back up your stock gen/alt.  Additionally you will need to add an additional 
bank of batteries that would be at least 2.5 times 1,280 watts (106.67 amps) 
= 3,200 watts (213.34 amps), because just starting the electric motor in the 
AC you need at least double the wattage it is rated for!!  The reason why you 
do not just double the battery wattage is that batteries degrade and you could 
smoke the inverter or AC unit if you do not supply enough wattage.  Plus with 
this bank of batteries you will be able to supply proper amp/watts to the AC 
when you are idling and the alternator is not going to be putting out enough 
power.

We think that if you really want AC you would be much better off finding a 
wrecked new automobile with AC and figure out how to install it in the bus.
