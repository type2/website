Subject: Restoration Question - Blasting
Mime-Version: 1.0

I'm almost at a crossroads with the '54, and need to make a decision.  I
have almost all of the frame bits (center rails, outriggers, etc) welded
in.  I want to send the entire bus out to be media blasted and primered.  I
am trying to decide whether to send it out when the frame is done, or wait
until I get all the new metal welded in.  FWIW, there is very little rust
left on the car at this point.  Of course there's very little metal left
either...

Pros of sending it now:
* Areas that are exposed, (ie underside of the front floors) would be
exposed and get a proper blasting and painting.
* they charge by the hour; it would be slightly cheaper to not have to
blast the clean new metal
* blasting will remove all the paint and bondo, revealing areas that are
still in need of work that I may not have considered

Pros of waiting:
* all parts will receive same primer treatment
* I'll be at the point where I just start the final bodywork from there

The only other person I knew who had this done did the blasting first, then
sent the car out for the heavy metal work.
