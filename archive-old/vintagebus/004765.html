!, went to clean up an engine that i pulled from a bus.
checked it out had new heads but an extreme amount of oil down 1 side.
retorqued the heads 3/4 side loose, but that wasn't the side with all the
oil,
cracked case i thought, no way. went to check the case halve nuts (6 of
them)
and low and behold they were loose!!!!. so i retorqued them and am sure that
will stop the leak.
saw this once before and that was on an engine of vwhowards, that he also
removed from a
bus he bought!!!  lesson learned? if you have an engine that is leaking on
the case nut side, check them. that could be your leak!!!!!!!!

2. learned a great trick for welding in cut out rear wheel wells, didn't
photog the first side
but am going to the second side, no need to step roll a lip after you learn
this procedure
to install new wheel openings, and you can butt weld and never tell it was
done!!! by the way
this is being done to vwglens 59 microbus at my shop, when you see it at the
shows check
out the wheel openings, or don't, rather you didn't know that they were ever
cut.(if you can tell)

this and other metal working/panel replacement proceedures will all be
available on my new
web site as it comes to be, stay tuned for future developments,

if you have a great tech tip you would like to share with the type2
community, let me know,
and it can be added to the tech tips pages.

3  havasu also has some assinine codes, but it's easy to get around for
vehicals, my 356 porsche
and my 62 mgb sit under covers, at home  (earthtone, city required)) which
satisfies the citys code,
and then all the buses
in my yard at home all run and are currently registered, but i only keep
insurance on the ones i drive
regular., and i live in the middle of the city, not a big city mind you,
40,000 people and 45 miles
either way from the next city and there smaller, but it keeps the code fuzz
off my back!!!
BUTT at my shop, they call it a wrecking yard (which it isn't in my book)
just recycling good vw
parts to keep them out of the landfill.  but after being haressed, i learned
that all i need is to make
sure all vehicals stored at my shop have titles (which they do) and i tell
them they are classics
destined to be restored (i mean reconditioned) so it makes it ok, especially
since the newest
vw i have in my yard is a 71 bubble and the oldest a couple 64 buses and
more bugs and buses
in between!!!

just some pre friday (it is somewere) rambling , being i hope to be on the
road tomorrow
to pick up the 66 walkthrough hardtop deluxe that i'm thinking of buying,
doesn't look bad in
the photos and the price is right!!!! hope it isn't a thom first trip but
more like his second,
and heck the same guy has a single cab for sale also!!!
