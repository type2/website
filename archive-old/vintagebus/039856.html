Alright, I've been waiting all week to repost this.  (It was cancelled near 
the start of the week for Friday).

I've been browsing this group as a new subscriber, and I hear a lot of 
chatter about Japanese buyers.  Could someone provide me with a bit of the 
background involved with this and also inform me of the current controversy 
which it is sparking?

Thanks,
-Wes
