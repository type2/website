&gt;They might do this, but is it really ethical to take advantage of this to
&gt;replace worn out power tools?

And that my friend is why people have no problems in using a power tool for 
5 years and then returning it when they want a new one.  This really is not 
a gray area at all, unless of course the tool when purchased came with a 
lifetime warranty (ala craftsman).

Those of us who stand by and do not take a stand on ethical issues, allow 
them to continue.  To look the other way and not call it as it is because 
we all just want to get along, is putting your comfort ahead of what is 
best for society.  I should step down now, before I get rolling.  Bus 
related, this effects all of us working on our busses as it serves to drive 
the cost of tools/parts up.

If you are interested in a study on how returns effect the consumer, look 
at Home Depot and how their liberal return policy is abused.  Things they 
have had to do to combat abuse.
1. Separate the return area so that you cannot walk into it directly from 
the store and &quot;return&quot; a tool.
2. provide store credit for products without a receipt
3. track returns to customers to flag abusers.
Home Depot estimates that they lost $6M to one person alone, working his 
way from store to store.

I now hear that the thieves are taking the HD credit vouchers to pawn shops 
and selling them for half their recorded value.

While all of these are not what Wayne's neighbor did, it is an extension of 
the ethical &quot;lapse&quot;.
Who is the greater thief, the one who picks up a tool and gets money for it 
5 minutes later, or one who uses a tool and then returns it for money 5 
years later?

Wayne, this is not to pick on you as I know you were only the messenger 
here, but I just felt necessary to add some thoughts on the subject.  Feel 
free to use my name with your neighbor any time,  &quot;I've got a friend on the 
bus list who would read you up one side and down the other for what you 
just did, thanks for making me pay for your five year rental&quot;.
