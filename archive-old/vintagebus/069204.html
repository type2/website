&gt; My passenger's side 2/3rds seat for my non-walkthrough, was there a couple 
&gt; of
&gt; screws that hold down the back part?? I remember someone telling me that 
&gt; you
&gt; didn't need any hardware to mount the front seats, but I see two holes that 
&gt; look like bolts should be in them, but then again maybe somebody added this 
&gt; on later??

Hi John,
Our best guess without images, is that you are missing the rubber stops that 
the back of the front passenger seat rests against.
