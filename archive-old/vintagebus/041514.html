&gt; OK,
&gt; 
&gt; Having just rebuilt a steering box I've gotta ask
&gt; why are the rebuilts so expensive? They're worth a fortune
&gt; changeover here in Australia as well.   
&gt; 
&gt; Really, the 'commonly' worn parts are roller and ball bearings which can
&gt; be found etc etc.  Not even caged bearings as such - hold em in
&gt; with grease like an old style bicycle crank. The worm and spline can have
&gt; wear but this can be adjusted out by adjusting the worm when fitting the new
&gt; bearings....

When my steering box failed, it was the peg (and probably the worm) that
failed.  These are rather precise machined parts which are then
case-hardened (?) and who knows what else.  My feeling is that it is these
parts that make the new boxes pricey.  This means that I am _very_ careful
to be moving before I crank the steering wheel around!
