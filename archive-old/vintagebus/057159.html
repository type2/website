You're Lucky! I have just found out that he has sold
nine cars that he hasn't delivered. He sells VW stuff
too so be careful. Criminal charges are in the works.

&gt; Hi,
&gt; 
&gt; An old guy. I bought a rear decklid for a 67
&gt; (complete) for $1. And I 
&gt; got it in a timely fashion.
&gt; 
&gt; One guy I thought had stiffed me, had gotten in a
&gt; motorcycle accident. 
&gt; After he was able to walk, he sent me the parts.
&gt; Sometimes you have to 
&gt; be patient with people.
