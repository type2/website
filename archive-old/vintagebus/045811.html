 &lt;&lt; When did the pocket stop?  I've got a '62.  Pocket or not? &gt;&gt;
 
 I found a pair of brown and white door panels with pockets in the attic 
 yesterday.  They are in pretty good shape.  Also had a few other panels from 
 the same bus.  Would rather sell them than move them.  I think they were 
from 
 a '59 +/- a few years.  Pmail if interested.
