 My church key latch for my gas flap is frozen solid. . . 
 Do you guys know the best way to unstick this---It's the only one I have and 
 I need it functional this week?
  &gt;&gt;
just a thought, which way are you trying to open it.   It opens by turning 
clockwise, and closes by turning counterclockwise, which, to me at least, is 
counterintuitive.   '

Liquid wrench?  or you favorite flavor of penetrating oil?
