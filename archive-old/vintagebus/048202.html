Hi Chris,
Unscrew the heater control knob at it's base from the bus and pull the handle.
The new cable will have to be bent into a U shape about half way from either
end.  Then look to see if the old cable is still in place and push the pin out
to release and remove the old cable and install the new cable.  As you slide
the new cable into the two tubes below the heater handle grease the cables as
you feed them in.  When you get down to the last foot or two of the cable
reinstall the knob and slide the retaining pin in place.  Screw down the knob
only a thread or two and go to the rear of the bus and check for the cables
reaching the heater boxes as evenly as possible.  Adjust the U-bend of the
cable as nessasary and then tighten down the heater knob on it's base.  If you
are running late model heaters make sure that the cages on the levers are
pinned to the hole on the lever closer to the piviot that the lever moves on.
The farther out pin hole is for the type 1 and post-1967 bus interior lever
knobbed heater controls.  Using the same pin hole for the turn knob control
will mean less heat output due to not opening the heaters up as much as
possible.
