Subject: Re: [VB] Infrared Powder Coating?

Infrared is a fancy way to say &quot;heat radiation&quot;.  I'd guess that he is
using a heat lamp or other source of heat radiation to melt the powder
rather than putting it in an oven.

&gt; I asked the only guy here in Marysville what size oven he has and he said he
&gt; dont, He used infrared.  He does everything up to car chassis with it. Does
&gt; anyone know if this is as good?  My guess is melting the stuff is melting
&gt; the stuff.  I am going to do the crewcab engine tin as well as the 36hp tin
&gt; at about $10 a piece he said.  I also took the opportunity to ask him if he
&gt; could do wheels since someone on the list said you cant cause the 400
&gt; degrees makes you loose the temper...  He said he does wheels all the time
&gt; .. $25 each.
&gt;
&gt; He also said to bring in bare metal, no zinc coating.  Sound right?
&gt;
&gt; I asked him about doing the muffler in powder coat and he suggested Jett
&gt; Hott coating due to the 400 degree break.  But I guess this only comes in
&gt; silver/aluminum color.  I have an original 36hp Abarth, and I think they
&gt; were originally flat black so thats a no go.  TIA
