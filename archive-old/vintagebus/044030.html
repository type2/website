Message-Id: &lt;Pine.SUN.3.92.991029142303.8437C-100000_at_cks.ssd.k12.wa_dot_us&gt;

I have a Bus (splittie) that has the duct work present for a gas
heater..no heater in place, but the switch and wiring are still there.
My question is:  Does the duct work from the factory or dealer come
spotwelded or is it a galvanized, riveted duct????
Thanks
