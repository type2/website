Subject: Heeeere's Ole Kelvin--Again--

Well,
My ole buddy Kelvin is back from his trip from South Africa --and on the
prowl again--
Trying to buy Bus, Vanagon stuff from an ad I have in the Westfalia
owner's site--

Here is a copy of the message I sent him--after he needs pictucure's and
details on some big wattage light bulbs.

For those of you who are not yet aware--this guy is nuts--and a snake in
the grass--
Avoid anyone with a good story and a bogus check--Especially ole
Kelvin--

It seems he must roam around the internet seeking &quot;Deals&quot;

What I wonder is where this fool comes up with the &quot;certified&quot; checks he
sends out??
Ya think he's printing them??

And how in the heck does the message he sent say&quot; possibly in Nigeria&quot;
???
Doesn't the provider he's using know where he is??

Crazy--

I hope he sends me a response to this one--:&gt;)

Later,

TK

Kelvin,
You old snake in the grass---
I see you have changed your E-Mail address, and your home country
again--
Last month you were a inhabitant of South Africa-- What a world traveler
you are--quite the lad--eh, what mate??

Let's see--

Last you prevaricated with me and you wanted my Vanagon jail bars , the
sky was the limit on price--no questions asked--and your &quot;representative
here in the US&quot; was going to be picking them up--after I accepted your
bogus, $2500.00, good for nothing, other than toitet paper &quot;reader&quot; (
word for a check here in Chicago --cause that's all ya can do is read
it--not spend it) and then becuase you think I'm some kinda super
dummy--just crawled out from under some rock kinda guy, you assumed that
I was out of the kindness of my Hungarian heart send you the change--

Yea--right---

And I'm Ringo Starr---

So Bozo--get a job--and drop my E-Mail address from your list of the
criminally insane, and unknowledgeable--

I hear Ya knockin'--But Ya Can't come in--
There are two chances of me getting sucked into your web--Spiderman--
(1) Slim--
(2) None

Adios Permanento El Bandito-----
