Subject: Re: [VB] Opinions needed on tire choice!

&gt; My main concerns with tires are two:
&gt; sidewall strength to handle the extreme sidewinds I encounter, and
&gt; wet traction at highway speeds (55 in rain).
&gt;
&gt; What have you found with regards to these? They are *really* critical to
&gt; me. Tire wear is not a big thing for me.  I have been using Michelin XZX
&gt; 185R14's for the last 17 years with no problems, and much satisfaction.
&gt; I feel safe in the rain and wind, and regret that they are discontinued.

Continental makes the reinforced sidewall tire for buses, 64 to 79. [ I miss the Michelins also, the XZX was
replaced by the MX before it was discontinued.

Tirerack sells the Continental CS21, 185R14, for $50 each.
