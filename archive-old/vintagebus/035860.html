&lt;&lt; Ok the manuals are in the mail but the tranny is drained and we want to
 hit the road tomorrow so.....  Help!!!
 
 Can we fill from center only or do we have to fill each RGB seperately?
 The bus is on a hoist so the wheels are hanging down.
 
 How much total to fill including RGB and tranny?  Would like to know
 when we are getting close.
 
 Appreciate any help

fill reduction boxes first, spin axles, fill till it bubbles from the axle 
tube (aboyt 1/2 to 3/4 quart each side- )

fill center section till starts dipping out of fill hole.


if you just fill the center you wont put enough in.

if you fill the RGBoxes last, it is easy to over fill.

takes a bit over 3 qts i believe, for tunnel case trannys.   I get a gallon 
and have a bit leftover.  split case take a bit less.

before filling- make ssure your boots are good- with out cracks or rips.   
Easier to change when oil is out as it makes less mess.
