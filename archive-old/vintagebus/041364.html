Hey Now!,
  
   This weekends Octobugfest, just south of Seattle, was a wonderful time.
The Seattle fall sun was out and it made the chilly temps a bit less of an
issue.  I didn't camp over but woke up bright and early and pickedup a few
people and made the trek from bothell down to the fairgrounds in the ford.
My bus is still under-perma-construction and we couldn't take the bugs
because each had its own lil problem.  We'd spent most of sat on the 66
tryin' to get in a piece of windowrubber.  We did all the tricks but it
just kept on getting caught up in the corners and ripping the rubber.  And
there was no way we were driving the bug with a great sound system down
to no-mans land without a window.  Some great busses in the lot.  A blue
westy with ribbed bumpers was esp nice.  A white 23 window had heads
turning.  And the usual suspects of trashed out stds,kombi's, and campers.
Inside the pickin', I felt, were slim.  I get a feeling that they always
are slim at a show like this(fall, in the NW,etc).  I couldn't find much
of anything that I really wanted.  Oh well.  Someone had a complete
interior set for 800. Rear, middle, all panels etc! But it was for a 67
walkthu! I picked up a complete early model parts book. Er, what else.
Only like 4 early busses in the show! A 23 window that I was scared to
breath around. It wasn't all org, but was repoed to org look. Still, it
was nice.  The before and after pictures were shocking! A coupla great
westys. A 62 So-34 with the flip up seat made me drool.  And there were a
coupla good busses for sale.  A 67 21: I saw this in the U Dist. and I ran
2 blocks to catch up to the lady driving. She got out and I tried to play
dumb and get a sale goin'. We chatted for a bit and I gave her my
number...now it's goin' for 10k.! Shoot.  An early ghia was really nice.
I wish I had the money, or I would have driven home it that.  

Anyway, to get to the point.  

I wanted to know about 58-61 taillights.  My 63 has the small round lights
on the rear and I know that it is incorrect(it's got egg lights up front).
So just from a lookin' standpoint, you know something is incorrect.  Now,
The right rear corner will have to be replaced.  No doubt about it.  I've
got a clip for it.  The other side is nice and I want to kept it as is.
Yet you can tell from the inside(piss poor cleanup job) that they welded
the corner in.  Should I suck it up and do it correct with correct lights
or should I just put on the small lights? Also, about the location of the
lights.  When I look at some of this era taillights I find that some are
kinda lower and some are kinda higher as far as position on the back.
Some look to be right next to the top of the decklid while others are a
bit lower. Can anyone inform me?
