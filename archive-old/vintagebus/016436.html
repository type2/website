Thom Fitzpatrick thought that Kabayo over-simplified
it a bit...
&quot;Home depot doesn't carry the correct stuff; neither
species of wood, grain or size.  You need European
sized sheets to be able to do the roof pieces, as
'merkin 4x8 isn't large enuf.  Also, you gotta give 
some for the cutting and finishing.  RVB can be more
specific.&quot;

Being fair to Lenny, what he is marketing is not
purely birch panels but &quot;convenience and availability
of product.&quot; Although I know for a fact that there are
some *very* talented wood crafts-persons/consumate
cabinet makers on this list &lt;self not included&gt;, not
everyone has the time, tools, materials, shop space,
desire, and talent to hand craft the prefered (and
proper) White Baltic Birch wood. There is a fair
amount of labor and sundry material costs involved,
even if you happened to 'cipher out the correct
dimensions of all of the panels. And no, the Westfalia
roof panels are not exactly square, nor are they the
same... Also go find yourself the long panel in one
singular sheet with the grain running vertically. Even
I didn't do that in the overly touted resto from hell
'67 Westy.
The common US spec 4' x 8' sheets of &quot;Birch&quot; paneling
at Home Depot is mearley a micro-paper thin skin
veneer of Birch mounted on one side of a cheapish wood
substrate. (In fact bought some for the EZ camper from
Home Depot last weekend!) The grain on that sheet runs
lengthwise and, as Thom mentioned, will not work for
the headliner panels or properly for the longpanel.
The final appearence does not come up to the same look
as the good schtuff. The nicer stuff comes in a
different size (and thickness if you mic it out...)
and has a thicker surface of nicer White Baltic Birch
on *both* sides. The right stuff also has a better
appearence when sanded and finished with the final
sealer. Past that point I will not infringe on Lenny's
market position of offering a &quot;convenient, complete
source option&quot; for those of us who choose not to
research, skin knuckles, make mistakes and figure it
all out for ourselves. Contact Lenny for more details
or go dare to make your own mistakes/successes! =)

The only serious question that I have is:
Lenny are you also including the hardwood header bows
for the hardtop and the hardwood header surround for
poptop?
As usual, I encourage everyone in whatever they choose
to do in getting/keeping their favorite VW on the
road.  I continue to thank and encourage most all VW
vendors for being out there and having the brass to
stick their necks out in providing product/services.
Without them alot of us would be in deep yoghurt.
