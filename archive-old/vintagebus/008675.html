I purposefully made this a bad link on my page until Diana viewed it and
gave it her approval.  She has said it looks great so to go ahead and let
everyone on the list know that the page is up and running.  Diana just got
done pulling her engine to tighten up the oil cooler (one nut just about
fell off she told me!) on Wednesday of this week.  So if you would like to
see before and after shots, just go to my page and you can see a slightly
tongue-in-cheek article accompanying the photos.
