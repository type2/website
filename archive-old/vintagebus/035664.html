Hi,   sounds like a decent driver.    What is the sellera asking.   how is 
the steering.  $1000 would be a deal.   I figure it woould probably be $2000- 
$2500?    Has new brakes and trans and motors and all, even if the body has 
some rust.

---------- - -- - -- ----  -- - 
Hello all. I usually never pay mind to these type of questions when I see

them on the type 1 list, and yet I find myself asking the same. I am about

to acquire another bus. Another 65 13 window deluxe. I'm trying to get a

rough idea of the value and I will describe to the best of my ability thus

far. First let me mention that I am in Augusta Ga where splitty busses

aren't very common but you can buy a 70's type 1 for next to nothing. It has

usual bus rust. Doglegs starting to go(some pinholes), area below the

nose/behind the front bumper(what is this called?) is gone, corners aren't

too bad but will need replacing. Rocker panel can be repaired on the drivers

side. Not too bad. Passenger side rear rocker panel? area near the rear tire

has a hole about the size of a baseball. It is 100% complete and original

except for the transmission. It has a NEW aftermarket trans with a different

4rth gear in it. Has one rebuilt redux box. Rebuilt dual port engine(well, I

guess that's not original either). Rebuilt brake system. Some slight surface

rust on the roof above the gutters no more than an inch or two up anywhere.

Original paint.(I believe it is seafoam blue and white) Still has jail bars

in great shape. Has a step below the cargo doors that mounts in the

outrigger points(is this rare?). Has the middle seat(is mine worth $2000

too? lol) and back seat. The only thing I noticed missing is the shifter

knob, but it has the extension piece still. A few of the popout latches are

broke, but I have several laying around. Gret front tires, but back ones are

dryrotted. Still has 6volt and everything except the clock works. Any rough

ideas would be greatly appreciated! Thanks again!
