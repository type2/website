&lt;&lt; I'm replacing the bearings on the front wheels of my '65.  There's a 
 race pressed into the outer side that I can remove with a punch and 
 hammer.  For the inner race- which is pressed into the brake drum hub, 
 it looks like I don't have the same kind of access to the back side. 
  There's two notches, but they don't appear to be all the way through to 
 the inner race.  How do I remove the inner race?
  &gt;&gt;

ya, there are slots there where you can use a punch to tap out the race- wipe 
out some grease and use a flashlight
