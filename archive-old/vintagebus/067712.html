Hm, I'd think there'd be something wrong with a clutch slipping at 3200K.

&lt;&lt; I've never driven or owned a pure stock Splittie but I've seen some very
 nice pure stock vans at the local independent classic VW repair shops.
 It was a daily driver until I started Hot Rodding it around town and now
 the clutch starts slipping about 3200 rpms (guess that is peak output on
 the engine). Its still a driver but I just can't run faster than 60 in
 4th gear before it starts to slip. &gt;&gt;
