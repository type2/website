Subject: Re: [VB] Just how fast does your bus go??

Top speed I have hit so far is &quot;O&quot; ...That is &quot;O&quot; as in Orange not &quot;0&quot; as in
Zero.  Spun the needle around till it was resting just over the &quot;O&quot; in the
VDO.  I guesstimate that to be about 80.  I forget what the RPM's were but
it wasn't too bad...3.44 Ring and Pinion and tall 15&quot; tires.

Worlds fastest Binz
(not to hard to do when only an handful actually run)

Subject: [VB] Just how fast does your bus go??


&gt; I was going to save this question for Friday, but all these discussions
&gt; concerning experiments and Trannys have me wondering about my bus.  Just
how
&gt; fast does your bus go??
&gt;
&gt; Everybody is talking about cruising down the road at 65 and 70 MPH; my bus
&gt; only goes 55-57 MPH (NOT 58+, unless there is a good tailwind and/or I am
&gt; going downhill).  I thought I was doing good, but I feel a bad case of
&gt; 'speed envy' coming on &lt;vbg&gt;.
&gt;
&gt; My '67 std is stock everything with a 1600SP engine.  I am running
P225R-15
&gt; tires.  Seriously, I was courious if it is because everybody has DP
engines
&gt; and higher performance trannys, or is it something I need to go out and
&gt; check on (performance-wise).  BTW it appears to be running fine.
&gt;
&gt; BTW I got my seals replaced on all the fixed windows over the holidays.  I
&gt; have a whole new respect for those guys that do it for a living (and the
&gt; back window was a REAL bugger).  Thanks for all the tips.
