&gt;...I planned on just buying a few of those bug bombs and &gt;letting them rip through the garage killing everything &gt;in or around...

spiders, blaaah, you want something real nasty, how about a ball-o-snakes. Wiley and I had to wrestle one to get the trans outa of a free vw, those suckers wouldn't leave the car, finnaly gave up and towed it to the wrecking yard, left the title on the front seat, you couldn't believe the smell.

or last summer when i was working inside my 68 convertible with the top up and i kept seeing something out of the corner of my eye drop out of the headliner, turned around and realized it was mice, about 100 of them, they ate the entire car, packed all the heater channels with dog food...

by all means lets win this war use the bug bomb,
