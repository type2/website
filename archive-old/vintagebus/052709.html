First off, that's not your tranny. I think maybe the throw-out arm has
broken. The new ones you can get at your FLAPS are welded much better
than the originals.

Secondly, what part of the country are you in? If you do much traveling
on mountain roads, you will get much more from a stock tranny, redux
boxes and all. Splitties kick ass on mountain roads. If you're in the
flat part of the country, you'll probably get more from a freeway flier.
