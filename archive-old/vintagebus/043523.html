Hello all!

If the rumored New Microbus looks anything like the renderings that
Hot VWs published a little after the New Beetle came out, you'll
find me down at the local dealer drooling on one.  It'll probably
be a bit beyond my means right now, though.  I still have to spend
some more money on the '64... :)

I'm wondering...what do y'all think this New Microbus, if it comes out,
will do to the market for air-cooled Buses?  I wasn't paying very
close attention but it seems that interest in and prices of real
Beetles went up when the New Beetle came out.

&gt;personally i doubt it will materilize as there is not an existing platform
&gt;that they could piggy back on a la the beetle using the golf chassis

Eurovan?  And remember, the first Dodge Caravan was really a K-car in
exactly the same way that our Buses are Bugs.  Different frame/body,
but front and rear suspension and drivetrain stolen straight from the
sedan.  The same idea that let VW inexpensively branch out from Beetles
in 1950 let Chrysler inexpensively branch out from K-cars in 1984.
