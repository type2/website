&gt; I've heard of it being done, and tried it once, but the amount of time
&gt; invested in dorking with removing all the stuff is greater than the time
&gt; required to remove the engine.
&gt;
&gt; Just think of all the other cool things you can do while you're in there:
&gt;
&gt; * check the engine mounts
&gt; * check the clutch
&gt; * look for any strange leaks from the tranny or engine
&gt; * replace the axle boots - easier with the engine out of the way
&gt; * fix those mis-functional heater boxes

I know, I know Thom.  The boots should be replaced and I probably should
look into replacing the clutch; the other budget buster from last summer
that will come back to bite me in the a** sooner than later.  I just didnt
want to go there (dropping  the engine after 3 months) right now.
BTW we dont need no steenkin heater boxes in FL; give us AC!!!
