&gt; Did some studying this weekend - learned almost nothing.
  
 &gt; So the last time I posted I talked about a steering problem .. 
 
 
 It pays to read _your_ mail.
 Our illustrious leader will do this job for a six-pack :)

Subject: [VB] Center Pivot Bushing
 
 
 Helped a friend replace his center pivot bushing and pin today.
 Unless a normal bus, the problem with his was that it was way too
 *tight*!  Steering the bus was difficult, and near the end of
 the travel in each direction, the poor thing would let out this
 &quot;scroink!&quot; sound.
  The biggest issue was getting the old one out.  I ended up rigging
 a puller and a huge piece of angle iron to lever against it to get
 it loose.  The new one went in like normal.  It probably took
 an hour to get the old one out, and 30 minutes to get the new one in,
 reamed, and everything assembled.
 
 I took detailed pix, and eventually I'll get around to filling in the 
 text.  This is an easy job when you have the correct tools!
