Hi Aaron,
Sounds like you probably could just replace the broken upper axle to get it 
running.  Could have been anything that caused the axle to break, wear, tear, 
or drag racing it.  We would check the other axle for damage/wear while the 
tranny is out.  Retorque all of the exterior tranny threaded fasteners back 
to the stock requirements, and go through all the the reduction box bearing, 
if not just replace them all.  Eric&amp;Barb
