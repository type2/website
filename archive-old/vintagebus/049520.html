Some folks might remember that I have been assembling a 1600 SP for some
while now (like, 6 months :P)...
well, after having ONE wrenching day a week off from work for many moons, I
FINALLY lassoed everything in one place and fired it up.

It's been said before, but I 'll say it again: nothing beats the feeling of
having something &gt;YOU&lt; built come to life!!!!!

I will post details later tonight, but all seems to be fine so far - not
even a drip.
