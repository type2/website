Subject: Re: [VB] Split Bus Sway Bars (Front and Rear)

----- Original Message -----

&gt; Do the rear sway bars for the splitty work with original trannies (swing
&gt; axle is the term, right?) and in conjunction with a camber compensator?

They bolt right up to stock swingaxle trannies with redux boxes. They do not
interfere with a camber compensator, but normally one or the other is used.
I wouldn't recommend using both at the same time.

&gt; Is the rear one compatible with the front sway bar that is stock on a 66?

I wouldn't recommend running a larger sway bar on the rear than on the
front. The 20mm front and the 18mm rear are a good match for eachother.
Stock front bar is too small to work well with the large rear.
