Subject: Brakes are Good.
Message-ID: &lt;37494B44.39EE6993_at_essex1_dot_com&gt;

I'd like to thank Jim Bryant, NEATO bigshot and new friend, for taking
the time to come over to my house on Saturday and help me go through a
front brake inspection.
Without Jim's assistance, I would be guessing and poking around in an
area where there is little room for error.
Jim, I'd like you to know that I'm sending in my membership dues this
morning, and I've read every word in those NEATO newsletters you left
with me.
For Woody and the DBG: Sign me up for the New Glarus trip and send me
the details. I'm bringing my &quot;sticker money&quot; with me.
-John Flowers
