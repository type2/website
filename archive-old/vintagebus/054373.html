Subject: Re: [VB] 8mm square socket-shift coupler

if you cant get them of with anything other than a square socket,
you are probably going to snap them off.
better to soak for a few days in penetrant oil
and try heating them to loosen
if you gotta put that much torque on them to loosen its no good try the oil 
and heat first before you breakem.
