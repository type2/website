Subject: Always a reason for spare parts

Always a reason for things.  Case and point:  I read the post from Eric&amp;Barb
about the parts list and saw a reason for all of the parts except for one..
the fuel pump rod.  Now, I asked myself, &quot;what in the world could go wrong
with that?&quot;  So I wrote them off list and asked them that question.  Their
reply was as follows:

As all things that rub and wear. The Distributor drive, washers, even the 
bottom of the engine case bore for the distributor drive, and/or push rod can
get to the point that the rod does not stick up enough to actuate the fuel
pump. Resulting in not being able to attain higher RPMs. So if one picks out
the longest rod to carry and this scenerio happens there is a good chance that
you can retify the problem enough to reach the next sign of civilization or
home even. Eric&amp;Barb

Well… I learned something.  I had no idea that this thing could wear to that
point.  Now, what makes it interesting is that it is one of those problems
that could be VERY hard to diagnose.  &quot;I threw a new pump on there and it
STILL doesn't want to go faster than 45mph!!!&quot;

The point being that this is one of those small items that could go in your
nuts and bolts can.  The bigger picture being that these are &gt;30 year old
vehicles and these things have BUNCHES of miles on them.  These engines are
made to go lots of miles, but with every subsequent rebuild, more of an eagle
eye has to be had to look for those weird problems that just don't happen with
a new vehicle.  And a good spare parts bin, that is if you are going to the
boonies.  Because even an eagle eye will miss those wierd situations.  Am I
right on this?
