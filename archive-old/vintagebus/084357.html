Subject: Re: Don Garies collection

Hey,

I've been wondering about that myself but never came across anything  
substantive.

 From what I heard, Scott (Don's helper who was always being ragged  
on) sold off most of the collection.  I'm not sure if Scott benefited  
financially from the sale, but hopefully did as he was probably the  
only one that looked after him.

As far as the Heb, I'm fairly certain the one that is for sale for  
$100k in East Texas is not the same one. I'm still mad that I missed  
the Heb's coming out party, which was just a few weeks before Don's  
passing. I sure would have wanted to meet him.

Conrad

&gt; Sorry for the thread hijack Ted...
&gt;
&gt; Wow, between the mention of Dallas and Garland, I had to think
&gt; about our old friend Don Garies...may he rest in peace.
&gt;
&gt; Anyone ever hear what happened to his collection?
&gt;
&gt; Paul
