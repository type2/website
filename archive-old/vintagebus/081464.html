Subject: Engine sounds

Hi Folks,
Excuse me if this is old stuff for you guys. While browing on another bus site
came across
this address for diagnostic aircooled engine sounds. It seems these were
recorded under the
direction of John Muir, writer of the &quot;idiot guide&quot;. I'd never heard them
before. Since I've never
seen it listed here either, thought I would post it. If you have decent
speakers on your computer
you'll be able to go through a list of diagnostic aircooled engine sounds.
Each one detailed in
what to listen for and some basic steps for troubleshooting.
I thought it was pretty neat! But again if it's old news......my bust!!
