Hi Matthew,
Wish you had made mention of what year bus you have!  Take a look at section 
A-14, page 2a, in the Workshop manual for crack repairs on doors made from 
DEC1963 from chassi # 1 222 026.  Even if you have an earlier bus this info 
should help since the hinges themselfs are the same.  Oil your hinges 
everyday for a couple of weeks to get the rust out of them and the oil in, 
and make sure to keep the check strap greased if your bus was made after 
DEC1963.
