&gt; &gt; my 'DD  was built 11/59, but sold in '60, so it's a 60.

&gt; So I guess in theory you could take a lot of paperwork down to DMV to show
&gt; production year and maybe push to have them change it to a '59...if it
&gt; really mattered to you. Could get rid of that &quot;60's&quot; stigma...right Thom!&gt; 

..Thom, if your bus was buildt in 11/59, it is a '60 model year bus.  yes buildt in 1959, but a 1960 model, even if it was sold in 59.
