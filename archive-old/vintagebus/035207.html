 Hi Dan,
 Which one of those bus side steps are you looking for?  The front door steps
 that are just mounted there, or the ones that fold out, or the cargo step
that
 mounts in the jack points (Aluminuim, or the diamond plate steel ones?), or
 the one that mounts under the bus and with a push of it's pedal the step pops
 out from under the forward cargo door?

I think when he said side step, he meant the step that goes on the side of the
bus. And I don't think he wants a ambulance step, most of those aluminum and
diamond plate steps can be found on the late models. I see them at the swaps
from 50-100 dollars.
                                                                              
Mike
