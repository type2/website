&gt;hello all,  i have a 1967 splittie and all of a sudden i cant find any
&gt;gears and when i do i am putting so much pressure into it that it
&gt;really scares me.  I am replacing my nosecone transmission mount, it
&gt;had a stripped bolt on one side, and was wondering if that was what
&gt;the problem was or if there is something more that needs to be
&gt;done?????  if there is anyone out there with helpful information i
&gt;would love to hear it.  Thanks for your time.   peace   mark, tampa FL


Mark, if your front mount is broken, that makes the shift coupler act as
your front mount. It doesn't like it much either. The weight of the tranny
plus driving torque can make it very hard to shift. Can toast the shift
coupling, too, and probably has. I would replace both of them, definitely.
Might be more to it, but those are the minimum.
