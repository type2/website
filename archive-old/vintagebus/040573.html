I have experience with gas, arc and mig.  I have never used tig so I'm
reluctant to go that direction.  The auto hobby shop on base has a tig
welder I might go mess around with.  I haven't welded anything in about two
years so it's gona take me a bit to get back into the swing of things.  I'm
a strong supporter of Gene Bergs &quot;buy quality cry once&quot; philosophy so I'm
willing to fork out some extra bucks to get quality.  As it stands I'm going
to shell out about $300 bucks over what my Dad is paying to make up the
difference (accessories).  Thanks for yours and everyone else's replies.
The last time I made a purchase and didn't quiz the list first I found out
that oiless compressors are crap.  Still keeping my fingers crossed on that
one.  Thanks again, I will let y'all know what happens.

Hi Chuck,

    You didn't say how much experience you have as a weldor, but just
remember the old saying, &quot;A weldor is only as good as his welder&quot;.
    With that said, did you look a Lincoln TIG 175? I have had one in our
shop for about a year and a half now, and I just love it. It works off of
common 220 current (like your home a/c or drier). It will weld any thing you
are likely to come up against, from a piece of 1/2 plate to two razor blades
edge to edge (the machine will, I haven't tried it yet). In, cast iron,
chrome molly, stainless, aluminum, mild steel, etc. It is an A/C - D/C,
stick, or TIG combination machine. It is the cleanest weld you will ever
see, you could weld in a dress suit (not recomended) if you had to. With the
foot amp control you can spot sheet metal with little or no warpage!
    Its not a Wire feed machine, so its not as fast as wire feed, and that
is my only disapointment, but the machine won't hold you back! You wont go
to weld someting one day and have to go borrow a machine. Its perfect for
sheet metal (such as body work), as well as welding Volkswagen case's,
heads, or almost any automotive, air craft, marine need, etc.
    I do have a Miller wire feed machine, I have had it for fifteen years, I
bought it used from a muffler shop that was closing down, and it was well
used then. It is a very good machine, fast, reliable, etc. and it makes a
perfect compliment to the TIG 175.
    $$$$$  -   I paid $1125.00 for my Lincoln, I know you said your funds
were limited to $1000.00, but I think if you would do a little more
research, you may want to try to raise the extra bucks. Visit some welding
shops, tell them what you type materials you work with,  maybe call a votech
instructor, ask around at some E-mail list'es. Oh you did that, and got me
bending your ear! No, I don't work for Lincoln, in fact, I'm sure Miller
makes a machine to compete. Another thing, any Lincoln store will set up a
demo for you, try the machine out, see what you think! Bring some of the
materials you work with, body panels, engine parts, heavy plate, etc. So now
the hard part is up to you!
    Let me know which one you pick.

See Ya, Gool luck!
