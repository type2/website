Subject: keyed 3.88

Hello all,

 I am a new member of the list. I have a  1955 with a  1959 SO23 interior.... I am currently running a 1500sp with a stock transaxle from a '66 single cab and M215 ( or is it 216) 1.26 ratio 'small' nut gears ( yes they are 36mm and I had to run spacers) 

My question is .... Does the aftermarket keyed 3.88 ring and pinion solve my problems as far as building the the traditional freeway flyer.... ( 3.88 and .82 4th)... Can my tranny builder simply install one of these aftermarket R&amp;Ps and use the rest of my stock internals and case? 

Any help would be appreciated... My engine seems fairly hot anytime I get up near 60mph... Often dipstick is too hot to hold on too....

I want to go faster and run a little cooler... Will my 1500 have trouble pushing the 3.88? Any experiences...

Thanks
Eric
