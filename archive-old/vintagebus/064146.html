Subject: splittie  nose

Was out at Russ's VW Recycling today, near Irwindale Speedway. He has a '67
van that had burned, but the entire nose was untouched, and in the best
physical condition I have ever seen. No dings, and only one small rust spot
near the bottom edge. The undamaged right front floor showed no rust, and as a
matter of fact, still had what looked like original paint.

If anybody needs it, that phone number is 626-303-4366.
