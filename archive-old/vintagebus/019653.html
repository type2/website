just to let you all know, the drawings of the ez camper interior are moving
along...i am going to be buying some wood today so i can try to cut out most
of the pieces this week. I will try to use my drawings and see how close they
are to the original...so that i can modify the drawings etc..

i must say the quality of construction of the ez-camper is pretty
poor...things that should have been cut straight are not, holes that should be
centered are not...and who had the bright idea of using pin nails to hold
everything together, they may work great in a piece of furniture but not a
machine that is shaking all the time.
