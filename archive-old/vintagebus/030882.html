A couple of years back, before I learned to be careful about buying from
eBay, I bought a copy of the VW Workshop manual there.  Which turned out
to be exactly that--a xerox copy!  While I don't mind folks having them
for personal use, I do get squeamish about reproducing copyrighted
material to make bootleg copies for profit.  (And especially about
passing it off to unsuspecting buyers like me.)  Needless to say, I
asked for (and received) my money back.

I was actually fooled by this trick...errr....ummm...twice... There was
also that audio cassette of Muir's VW engine sounds....
