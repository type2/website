Subject: Re: [VB] Front window rebuilding

The first thing you want to do is get all the rust out.   You can use a wire 
wheel on a drill, or a grinder, but get it all out, or it'll creep back.   If 
there are holes you can stick something through, you should get a patch piece 
and weld it in.   You'll find the metal is pretty thin around the rust hole.  
I think repro pieces are made, but I have no experience with them.   If it is 
the flat area, you can use a middle bar off a dead bus for patch pieces, but 
usually any bus with good window ledges is restorable, so it's hard to find 
that corner curve as a patch piece from german metal.   I've used spot filler 
to fill in rust dimples to get a smooth sealing surface before painting.  
Hope this helps.

&lt;&lt; I'm looking at attempting to rebuild some of the lip that the rubber window
 seal goes onto on front windows of my double cab.  It's on both sides of the
 center pillar at the bottom.  It's pretty much non-existent right now.  I'm
 going to be using a metal filler, similar to 3M panel bonding adhesive.
 Does anyone have any tips on this?  I hope I'm making sense.
