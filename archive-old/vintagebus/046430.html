&lt;&lt; Hi list,
 
 Getting ready to check out the possible barndoor find this afternoon. Have
 questions:
 
 Do barndoors have VINs like later buses that tell when they were
 manufactured? If so are they in the engine bay like later buses? If not
 where are they? The bus in question is apparently way in the back of a shed
 and is filled/surrounded with junk and I will have less than an hour to
 check it out.
-------------
no m-code plate (till ~ ch 398 000)
The vin only says the year in it as of 1965 and later model years, before 
that it was just a serial number the VIN.
Body number behind the front seat- pass side- not the same as the VIN, but 
usuallu close
VIN is stamped in engine compartment on right near battery, also on plate on 
bulkhead in front of engine on right of middle- use flashlight and rag.
.....................................
 
 If they don't, are there any tell tale signs of the model year like turn
 signals and front door handles in later splits?
 
------------------
check out whether it has regular pop out frames or early ones (the early ones 
have the latch holes horizontal on the frame) - 

do parts have regular 9 digit number such as 211 xxx xxx, or ones that start 
with 29. 
Not sure when that change is- late 53 or early 54? (before the window frame 
change)

the cab doors have piano hinge vent wings 52 and earlier, regular vent wings 
53 and later

speedo changed for the 36hp motor to swing the same way as later buses.  25hp 
motors buses have the needle swinging below.

Have fun!!!
