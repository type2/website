Ellis says that working for &quot;the man&quot; is keeping him in town this weekend.
Saturday shift from noon to six pee-em kills his day. Added to the M-F until
1AM plus Saturday cuts into my pre-Classic/OCTO honey do list. I might creep
up Sunday AM if at all possible. Tons to do before June. I'd rather be set
to ramble the '54 to the Charlie/Kimball fest. Sorry troops.
