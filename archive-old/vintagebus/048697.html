Subject: Painted some Kombi stuff

Wanted to mention I got my bumpers, wheels, window frames, and a 
bunch of misc. parts painted. I hung them from the ceiling using a 
hooks and wire (I think Thom suggested this...or something like it). 
I did everything at once. I had 1/2 gallon of my white left over from 
painting the shell to use.  (that's before mixing in reducer and 
hardener). I used every bit of it! I can't believe how much it took 
to paint all those things. I think I got everything covered good. 
I'll have to get a good look again tommarrow. It's real hard with all 
those little places and different little angles to get it all using 
my sears paint gun. But I did it and everything seems cool. I've been 
stuck at this stage for a LONG time and I'm glad to have it behind 
me. I never did really do any straightening of my bumpers. So they 
won't look as good as they should. I guess I'm just kinda running out 
of steam. But the end is a near.

Also, we started a VW club here in San Angelo, TX. We had about 30 
people show up for the first meeting. We took a drive in a long VW 
line all around town as the sun was going down. VERY cool. That was a 
few weeks ago. We had another get together this past sunday during 
the hot day and took another drive. We ended up going past a Lowrider 
show and ended up crashing it. We pulled through the parking lot and 
you should have seen the look on those guys faces! They were very 
cool about it though.

Well, I'm brain dead right now and just popped some pain medication 
to fight the intense headache sure to come (yes I have a respirator 
and yes I wore it. I get a headache from cleaning up the dust in my 
garage and from fumes I accidently let sneak in my mask every now and 
then...) See ya!
