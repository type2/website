Kevin writ:

&gt;I think in days of yore they used to heat bricks or rocks on the stove then
&gt;put them in the bed with them. Maybe heating one up on the Coleman
&gt;stove and
&gt;putting it in your sleeping bag is the answer.

A word of warning:
 My father did this once on a deer hunting trip. Heated a rock in the fire,
wrapped it in wet cardboard and aluminum foil, then put it in the bottom of
his Coleman down bedroll (too big to be called a sleeping bag). When the
rest of his party returned (drunk and disorderly) from the wh*rehouse in
Nevada, they saw smoke pouring from the tent trailer. Not only did he burn a
hole thru his bag and the floor of the trailer, he was nearly asphyxiated by
the smoke. BE CAREFUL!
