E-mail's acting up, so I didn't see the first list...but I didn't see anything in Kyle's list that sounded excessive. I also toss in assorted engine parts. I'm thinking of adding a milk crate to the inventory, as I find myself doing top-end rebuilds on milk crates even though I now own a regular engine stand.

When I show up at local swap meets, I almost always have more good parts stashed away in my bus than some of the swappers...though I'm a little short on chrome-platted cherry picker accessories these days.
