The ONLY thing I found that killed it and cleaned the spots a little was
Woolite mold and mildew killer in a spray can. I tried every product I could
find on my sundial tent and this was the only thing that REALLY worked, but
8 cans later at 4 dollars plus a can and less then a 1/4 of the tent done I
moved on to lesser products without the same results.

Hi all....

I have my driveaway Westy tent (68+ up style) up in my front yard to air
out, 

there are a couple of spots where there is black mold / mildew. 
the material is fine, it just has these black blotches

what can I spray on it to kill the mildew and not harm the fabric?

I am not too worried about the spots, I just want to stop the mildew before
I 
pack it up again

thanks for your advise
