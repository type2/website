For RMMW, a bunch of the Buskatiers have reserved a quite a few sites at 11
mile campgrounds in Colorado.  I'm not quite sure where it is.  Dave
Easterwood, Dan Kinsey, and myself got reservations at a nice facilitated
campground called Mueller State Park or something like that.  Nobody had
really said where the camping was going to be and after they found out that
we had just went ahead and did our own thing, the Buskatiers banded together
and within about 3 days had the big campout all planned.  Go figure.  But
you gotta hand it to 'em for pushing ahead and getting it done!

I haven't heard anything about Rainbow Falls this year.  That was one cool
campground.  Basically a valley between 2 hills and minor facilities.  If
you want to know more about the Buskatiers campout, email
rookie1_at_kscable_dot_com
(Keith our webmaster) and he'll tell you all about it.  I guess if that is
where the action ends up being, Ronnie and John Howard will be there.
