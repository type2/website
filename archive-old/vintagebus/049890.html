Subject: Re: [VB] 'That VW Guy' - A WARNING TO EVERYONE - LONG

&gt;Umm.
&gt;
&gt;Perhaps I missed something...

Yes, I think you did.


but what exactly are you warning us about?

Somebody who takes two weeks to answer a question about something he has
offered for sale, and then forgets what was requested in the first place.



&gt;
&gt;About the fact that sometimes people dont have time to go check out minor
&gt;parts to see if they have the part number you want?  I would not have
&gt;known which individual piece of the lock mechanism (a .very. general
&gt;description that covers from the cylinder to the .latch, and everything in
&gt;between) you wanted either.

NO, it's the EXACT name of the part, and I wouldn't call it &quot;minor&quot;.  And
part numbers are listed in both of the catalogs I mentioned (RMMW and WW),
as well as many more.




&gt;
&gt;You purchased a regulator that fit the desciption that was given, (it was
&gt;.not. listed as a &quot;NOS 6v 66 bus regulator&quot; was it? did you inquire before
&gt;bidding if it was correct?)

As I wrote, &quot;My fault&quot;.


&gt;
&gt;Then you purchased a shifter extension, which i presume you were satisfied
&gt;with...

Yes, it seems very nice, though I haven't installed it yet.  I don't
criticise everything, but give praise where priase is due.



&gt;
&gt;and then you offer a vague description of a part (true, with a part
&gt;number...but with parts installed on a bus, that cna get rather tedious to
&gt;tear into to find which part you want! much better to give a thorough
&gt;description of the part in question) and expect immediate results.

I gave an EXACT name and part number, easily looked up in a parts catalog.


&gt;
&gt;then, when you do not get results as fast as you would like (mind you, you
&gt;did not state in your original message that you needed an answer
&gt;quickly...even unemployeed people have things that occupy their time,
&gt;thank you very much. For instance, looking for new employment..) you get
&gt;this major attitude, start yelling, and then call people names.

Two weeks plus, just to find out if a part is in stock, and the price.  Do
you not expect better service from those you do business with?  I find it
annoying if I don't get a simple answer like this within 24 hours.



&gt;
&gt;Perhaps we should resubject this thread as &quot;[VB] 'Kabayo' - A WARNING
&gt;TO EVERYONE - LONG&quot;


Maybe so.
