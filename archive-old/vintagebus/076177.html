Subject: A friday issue

Greasy Volks,

Son Bry and I didn't look a gift horse in the mouth, and took a '79
camper, not a Westy, off a poor starving student for twenty singles. 
The engine looked to be in good shape and the captain's chairs (4 of
'em, look superb.)  

Last night we took out the engine for possible use in our '72 Westy
that is limping along with bad compression ratios.  It wuz 9:30 by the
time we jacked her up and got into serious unbolting mode.  Well,
wouldn't you know, Bry forgot about the return gas line which is
characteristic of fuel injections.  We pulled the infernal machine away
from the fire wall and popped off that return line.  Oooh, what a
dangerous mess.  We lost about 2 gallons to the ground and an assortment
of small plastic containers before I was able to dash into the garage
and find a gas hose for Bry to put on the nipple and  into an empty gas
can.  Whew, close call.  We emptied well over 5 gallons out of the
thang.  I did have a fire cannister nearby, but that wouldn't have done
it.  To top it all off, my neighbor's 2001 deisel over the road tractor
was sitting in the shared driveway five or six feet adjacent to us. 
Double whew!  Fortunately it was a warm night and in our dry air, the
stuff on the driveway evaporated quickly.  We put the lights away pronto
and decided to carefully clean up and let the half-removed Type IV just
sit as she was until tonight.  Wouldn't you know, it rained last night. 
Went to bed a tad bit &quot;high,&quot; both of us did.

Question:

We noticed that some PO in another life installed some rather sizable
fin coolers, huge things, one below the drivers seat behind the front
wheels, centered, and one further back, again centered, below the
undercarriage.  There were hoses, but in the dark we couldn't see where
they went to.  I don't think they were oil coolers, far, far too large,
these things were about 10 inches  wide and at least 2 feet long, maybe
18 inches.  They were covered with a diamond mesh similar to that used
for stucco siding these dayz, to protect agains road hazards.  There is
a sink in the camper unit, Bry wuz thinking water cooler, but I dont'
think that makes sense.  We are anxious to find out where those hoses
lead to!  Any ideas?   We'll find out tonight.  I told him it's not a
Type IV, but a wasserboxxer in a Loaf!  Duh.  Ha, ha.

The engine looks to be in pretty good shape as is the bus except for
some minor surface rust and a couple of dents in the front around the
lights.  Ruins the trim line. 
We'll try to sell it before parting out or hauling to the yard. 

Any ideas on what the coolers are?  Must be oil.  If so, she sure ran
cool!

Curt
