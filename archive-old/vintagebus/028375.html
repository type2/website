Subject: Ohio Shows

Of the two Ohio shows coming up which would be the better show to
attend?

June 25 Buggin the country, Wooster Ohio:
July 1-2 Buckeye German Jubilee, Columbiana Ohio:

I would like to make travel plans to attend one of these shows but would
like to know which one would be a &quot;better&quot; event.

Thank You!

Meredith
