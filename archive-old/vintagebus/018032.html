The ones I have are actually &quot;VW do Brasil&quot; and mine *do* overlap in
the middle.  When I bought these, the seller convinced me I could 
modify them to work for RHD.  I've spent a few hours mapping out
what it would take, and I've come to the conclusion that it would be
a LOT of work!

First, I have to swap the edges, where the floors meet the cargo doors,
and where it meeds the supports.
Then I'd have to re-flange it so the flanges went up instead of down, because
you'd have to flip the floor piece
Then I'd have to move the seat mounting divots about, so the seats would be in
the right place.

It's a lot of work.  I *could Be done, but I'm going to avoid it if I can.

&gt; thom I have a set of those floor halves 
&gt; good - they are thick and the stampings are OK
&gt; bad - they are not quite full, there is no lip in the front and there is a
&gt; gap in the middle of a couple of inches.
&gt; I dont know if he has changed them.
&gt; Donor is better. I know in your case with the BD RHD thats not very likely
&gt; but
&gt; modifying a LHD set might still be a better solution.
