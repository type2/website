My '54 has 'em.

Clara, does your '53?

I dont know, my headliner is too complete for me to care about speaker wires. 
 For all I know there are speakers back there, though I had the impression 
the wires/brackets were for 63 and earlier deluxes.

FWIW, I was told that 53s has a unique material for headliners.  no idea if 
this is true or not- any body else heard this rumour.?
