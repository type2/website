Subject: Re: Blinker woes again

I double checked my wiring and it is set up just as the diagram I got off of the VB website. 

Matt:
First, pull #1 (blue) off of the flasher, and turn on the ignition. You
&gt; should be able to make the arrow light in the speedo light up by grounding
&gt; the blue wire to the body. You should be able to do this regardless of
&gt; the position of the headlight switch or dash light dimmer.

Seth :
Tried this and got nothing
&gt;
Matt:
&gt; Next, pull #2 and #3 off of the flasher, and connect them to one another.
&gt; This effectively replaces the flasher with a piece of wire, so your
&gt; outside turn signals should be on all the time. When you flip the turn
&gt; signal lever to one side, the front and rear turn signal lights on that
&gt; side should come on and stay on. Try each side by itself, then while
&gt; stepping on the brakes with the key on, then with the parking lights on,
&gt; then with the brakes and parking lights on. (Note that the arrow light
&gt; in the speedo WILL NOT LIGHT UP during any of these tests.) If anything
&gt; is not as expected, the problem is NOT in the flasher! It can be many
&gt; places but the most likely are the grounds at the rear lights, and inside
&gt; the turn signal switch.

Seth:
This works neither

As stated before my turn signals were working (except right rear w/ headlights on) before I put the blinker wiring to spec as on the diagram, thats why I do not think it is in the turn signal switch or the grounds on the taillights, which are soldered,(should of made notes, LOL). The part# for the hazard relay is 211 953 101A it is a 12V relay. I do remember that the wires were on different pins prior to me rearranging things to the wiring diagram. Also, one of the blk/grn/wht wires was moved from the fuse box to join up with the other blk/grn/wht wire as on the diagram and a third blk/grn/wht wire replaced it as on the diagram, very confusing. 
As of right now pin 30 on hazard relay has the purple/blk wire to it by itself and that joins up with a blk/grn/wht wire that comes from the fuse boxes far right fuse; where these join at is the flasher relay. Pin 86 on hazard relay has the gray wire that goes to hazard switch and the light on the dash. Pin 87 on hazard relay has the blk/wht wire to Y type junction that then goes to the turn signal switch and the L turn signal. Pin 87b on hazard has a blk/grn wire the goes to a single junction and directly to the turn signal switch. The blk/wht/grn wire from hazard switch joins with the blk/wht/grn wire that comes from the turn signal switch(S4B1on schematic), they both terminate at the flasher. And of course the blue wire goes to the speedo light on top. 

Does the fact that this is a 12V hazard relay have any bearing? Does the location of the wires on the hazard switch have any bearing? The diagram shows no pin numbering for the hazard switch so I presumed it did not. Also all soldered points on turn signal switch look good. All connections have been scuffed with 200 grit sandpaper and had dielectric grease applied. The PO also had one of the wires that the diagram shows going to the hazard switch going to the headlight switch and this is when I at least had some turn signals. 

When the three wires that terminate at the flasher are connected the only thing that lights up is the arrows on speedo.

Thanks for bearing with me.

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Now, where before I only had the right rear blinker not working with the
&gt; &gt; headlights on, all of my blinkers don't work.
&gt;
&gt; At the flasher relay, next to the fuse box, you should have three wires:
&gt;
&gt; 1. blue - arrow light in the speedo (K on original flasher)
&gt; 2. black/white/green and black/purple on same connector - unswitched
&gt; feed from battery (+ on original flasher)
&gt; 3. two black/white/green on same connector - pulsating voltage to turn
&gt; signal switch (S on original flasher)
&gt;
&gt; First, pull #1 (blue) off of the flasher, and turn on the ignition. You
&gt; should be able to make the arrow light in the speedo light up by grounding
&gt; the blue wire to the body. You should be able to do this regardless of
&gt; the position of the headlight switch or dash light dimmer.
&gt;
&gt; Next, pull #2 and #3 off of the flasher, and connect them to one another.
&gt; This effectively replaces the flasher with a piece of wire, so your
&gt; outside turn signals should be on all the time. When you flip the turn
&gt; signal lever to one side, the front and rear turn signal lights on that
&gt; side should come on and stay on. Try each side by itself, then while
&gt; stepping on the brakes with the key on, then with the parking lights on,
&gt; then with the brakes and parking lights on. (Note that the arrow light
&gt; in the speedo WILL NOT LIGHT UP during any of these tests.) If anything
&gt; is not as expected, the problem is NOT in the flasher! It can be many
&gt; places but the most likely are the grounds at the rear lights, and inside
&gt; the turn signal switch.
&gt;
&gt; One way to think of a turn signal flasher is as a self-resetting circuit
&gt; breaker that is slightly undersized for the load of the turn signal
&gt; lamps. If you don't draw enough current through it, like if one of your
&gt; lamps is burned out or has a bad connection, it won't start flashing.
