Hello all,
Just to let everyone know, there is a show in Houston on August 5  (Sunday)
_at_ Trader's Village (290 at Eldridge) which is usually our biggest show of
the year. Swap, show and under cover (mostly)
For the out of towners that might consider coming down we are having a
pre-show barbeque/get-together the night before. So if anyone is interested
in going p-mail me for details.
Thanks,
Brian
