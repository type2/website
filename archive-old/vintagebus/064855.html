&gt; Bus content question:  While looking under a 70's Super, I noticed weird
&gt; oil lines coming off the oil pump and going to a small tank (upon future
&gt; inspection I realized it was for the autostick. I've never even looked
&gt; at an auto VW over so didn't realize the pump looked like that).  Is
&gt; there any reason one could not use that type of pump with the outlet and
&gt; return already plumbed into the cover of the pump to route oil to a
&gt; cooler or filter???  Why or why not?

This has been discussed before.  The autostick pump is really two separate
pumps, the forward pump is the conventional setup, while the aft pump was
to supply ATF to the autostick torque converter.  There's no reason that
the autostick pump cannot pump engine oil.

The idea was to braze a tube into the sump plate, take oil from there,
run it through the aft pump to a filter/cooler, then return the oil to the
sump via another nipple on the oil filler or type 3 dipstick blockoff.
This would be a bypass system.

Downsides would be that the pump probably won't fit in front of the
mustache bar, you would have to provide a thermostat/bypass so you don't
overcool or burst filters.

Upside, This might be a way of getting cabin heat, as long lines on this
circuit won't affect pressure to the bearings.  One would have to do some
calcs to see if the heat gained would be worth the effort.
