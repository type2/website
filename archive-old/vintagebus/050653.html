Subject: RE: [VB] Progressive carb

You need to get one of the 74-79 bug fuel pump that has a 10 degree tilt at
the top. That pump was designed for the wide bodied alternator installed on
late model bugs and I have heard that this pump will work. There has also
been some differences in the center section design for the progressive. I
have seen three different types so far, and one does have a large throat
design. I have always used the little 3 1/2 PSI facet electric pump with
block off plate. It allows you a lot of room above it. These pumps are
available trough many of the ads in the VW magazines.

Just as a note, I had the same problem with the choke lever on a 73 Honda
carburetor I adapted for a 1910cc a few years back. My fix wasn't as
eloquent, I cut out a hole behind the choke lever in the fan housing and
brazed in a 2&quot; freeze plug !.

Fellow Oldies:

My son and I (mostly him!) are finishing off my new Bergmann 1835cc long
block.  When we went to put the manifold and carb on, we found that the
progressive carb choke tends to hit the fan shroud, and that the fuel pump
is in the way.  We are using one of those Brosol fuel pumps that has the 4
screws on top and I guess can be rebuilt.

Anyone know which fuel pump will allow a progressive to sit on top with
adequate clearance?  I assume it will be one of those Brazilian/Mexican
cheapies, but which one? My local FLAPS (???, what is that)
Parts-For-Imports/Foreign Aid, has at least a couple different
models/brands.

Thanks in advance.

Curt
