Subject: Re: [VB] California, Smog and VW's  (New CA smog law
  introduced)

&gt; The vote is scheduled for the end of this month.  If
&gt; you drive a 61 to 73 bus (or any car for that matter)
&gt; as a daily driver (over 12K/yr) then you will have to
&gt; have your car smoged if this one passes.

No the solution is to get more busses and rotate.
2 or 3 daily drivers for everyone
