&lt;&lt; We imported a few of these (although they were crew cabs) and they were 88

 models.  Bay windows with bug IRS, 1600 DPs, and a Rhino trans.
 
 This was when I worked at SCAT.

I have seen them with ball joint front end, also with kingpins.  The cargo 
door is very like a barndoor, but much better reinforced. Think this one guys 
was a 72.  It had a pop top.
