&gt; Sounds like you found yourself a Brazilian splittie.
&gt;You know they sold those till the mid 80's. Not sure
&gt;if they  made campers though. Need pics to be sure.

Unlikely. The Brazilian splitties (built until 1975) were splitties through
and through, although they were a hodge-podge of early and late parts.

The Brazilian split/bay hybrid which followed in 1976, and is the vehicle
sold through the 1980s (and early 90s???), has a baywindow front and roof
grafted to a splitty rear, with late bay taillights. They have king and
linkpins in front and the weird double-jointed axle and reduction box in the
rear.

You can see pics of this RGB set-up and a couple of 1975 Brazilian splitties
on the vintagebus_dot_com gallery. Search for &quot;fig&quot;.
