Hmmm are you refering to this? http://ploon.nl/wob/plattenw.htm Thats the
only thing ive ever seen as far as a &quot;singlecab prototype&quot;...of course its
technically the bus prototype

&gt;Does anyone have, or know of a webpage that shows a picture of the very
first prototype for the Single Cab?  I've seen the picture before, it's a
very archaic vehicle that is a long stretch from what we all envision a
Single Cab to be.  I believe it's pictured at the factory.
