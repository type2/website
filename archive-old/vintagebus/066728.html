Subject: Re: [VB] POR15

Por-15 also has a primer that you can put over Por-15 even after it dries
and it accepts almost any paint. It is called Tie-Coat Primer. Here is their
ad info........

Now, prime and paint right over cured POR-15. with our new TIE-COAT PrimerT.
After thousands of requests from customers, our chemists developed this very
special 'interlocking' primer for painting over top of POR-15. with any type
or color of paint you choose, without any need to rough up or de-gloss the
surface.

TIE-COAT PrimerT is a tough-yet-sandable single-component polyurethane
primer, with special adhesion characteristics that make it perfect for most
painted surfaces... Especially POR-15.. And, it is highly resistant to
penetrating topcoats, like lacquers, enamels, and two-component finishes. It
sands very smoothly, too. Try some on your next project!

*NOTE: Enamel, Lacquer, Urethane or Basecoat Clearcoat may be applied over
TIE-COAT PrimerT.

* NOTE: This product cannot ship Air.

And for our friend Pual across the pond   http://www.frost.co_dot_uk/  . You
probably know them but it is the thought that counts......lol.
