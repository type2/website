I read this and was thinking what a great idea it would be to know which 
pieces from which manufacturer are bad and which are good.  Anybody with 
experience please throw your 2 cents in...especially if you have worked with 
both.

&lt;&lt; Well I had a friend buy inner and outer
 rockers, floors and doglegs from Schofield.  I must
 say I was NOT impressed at all by the stampings and
 fit...they were actually below the level of quality I
 have seen in some other's panels.
 
 I have found Wolfsburg West's inner and outer rockers,
 outriggers and jack points to be very good...the
 doglegs are so-so...nose pieces are decent.  their
 corners will fit and line up decent but require some
 fitting.  But their battery trays absolutey
 SUCK...they need tons of re-working. &gt;&gt;
