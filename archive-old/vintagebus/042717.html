well,

thought i'd chime in...

In my garage... (its big enough to fit 5 busses if you dont want to walk
around much probably cram in 7 bugs i'd bet...)
82 westy, (contianing a spare 80 engine, a 78 bus tranny, and misc. parts)
2 or 3 disassembled core 1500's 1 assembled core 1600, and one good? 1500
a tranny case, a bad tranny, a bug tranny, and a 61 tranny, a 61 front
beam, and a cupla redux boxes some 78 spindles, about 6 bumpers and 8-10
wheels/tires 
a 66 deluxe (its a mess!) containing all its parts and spares
my 61 or my GF's jetta in the center bay
air compressor, gas welding rig, kerosene heater, big ass fan, various
other tools. (220v mig welder on the way by winter..)
1 shelf, 3 workbenches

out front, my 71 bus (it runs)

I hang my roofrack on the wall when its not on my bus. Im sure that i have
other crap there as well...

And i think the 66 may be going to the farm (80 vgon, 67 kombi, 70 std
already there, dont get me into what those busses contain as they are all
full!)

In its place i hope to put a couple of new busses i have my eyes on... and
a coupla more busses im helping to part out's parts...

take care,

Steve

p.s. dont get me started on the VW contents of my basement and living room
unless you want to read a lot...
