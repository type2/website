&lt;&lt; Has anyone ever done this conversion on a single or double cab?  I'm 
 wondering if you can get the tank in there given the &quot;bar&quot; on the bottom of

the 59 single cab I had for a bit had a 15gallon tank in it, used a bay 
window gas cap.    Came like that to me.  Also got about 28 mpg, so I could 
go 400+ miles w/o getting gas.  wow.  Half way to the Bay Area.
