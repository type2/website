&gt;I was under the impression that '65 was an &quot;'65 ONLY&quot; part. I'm sooooo
&gt;confused....

&gt;&gt; The seller suggests these might only fit up to - '65. Is this true?

I thought that the motor, linkage, and shafts were '65 only, but the arms
and blades were the same from around '61(?) up through '67.  I don't know
