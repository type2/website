Hey Volks

Well, we overran our original planned departure date by
three weks, but the ZebraSafari Cape to Cairo by Kombi
expedition is on the road!

We left Johannesburg yesterday, on the coldest day so far
this year. The bus is quite heavily loaded, but running like
a champ.

After lsoing my computer on the eve of departure I have
bought another laptop and all is well again. I had a major
panic after my last computer was stolen, but the day I
committed to buying a new one I received a tax rebate cheque
for twice the amount I was expecting, so replacing the
computer was a non issue ... apart from losing most of my
contacts.

Only a handful of listees have updated their email addies
with me, and I haven't yet heard from any of the non-listees
who corresponded with me, even though I'm sure most of them
got my email from a listee. So, if anyone forwarded my
details to anyone off list, please let them know that I have
lost their details and am not avoiding replying to them. And
there are a few listees who I've had correspondence with who
haven't re-established contact. Please drop me a note! Uncle
Jerry?

I am writing our first journal entry, which will be posted o
our website tomorrow. The site should be going live as we
speak. Please follow our adventures at:
www.liondreamer_dot_com/africa/adventures/zebrasafari/

The site will be updated with journal entries and
photographs as often as we can get a dial-up (which may not
be easy in darkest Afrika). The site will also feature video
streams on a subscription basis.

We are en route to Cape Town (via an indirect back route).
We will take a few more days to get to CT, where we will
spend a week or two before heading north. I will still be on
the list for as long as I have access to my local dial-up.
