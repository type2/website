 Hey all,
 
 I've got a 67 and the one key operation works on everything but the
 cargo door handle.  Shouldn't this be keyed the same as the others?
 
  &gt;&gt;
the locks changed to take the longer &quot;L&quot; series key in the 67 model year.

the key being longer, but the cargo door handle being the same shape, people 
who tended to yank on the cargo door handle would break the 67 version.

in 68 the handle is stronger, with a larger square shaft.

it is a good identifying mark, if you see a split w/o cargo door handle, 95% 
chance it is a 67

it is difficult to get the bus  to one key when the lock doesn't take the 
same profile key.
