  Any listees going to the Manassas  VA show at the end of May? My friend
and I will be leaving Va Beach Sat morning on the 29th. We hope to get up
there aroung noon or shortly thereafter. We'll be in a lowered 63 23
window, white on top and turquoise on the bottom. really sweet bus. If
you're there you'll se us driving around your hotel I'm sure.
Jason
