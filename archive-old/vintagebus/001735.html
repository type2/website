Hi everyone,

    I've been looking through the archives and haven't found anything about
the coils for gas heaters so I thought I'd see what you all know about
these,. . .

    I've got an Eberspacher BA4 (NOT to be confused with the popular BN4
found in most gas heater equiped busses) out of a 411 type4.  It's actually
similar to the Vanagon BA6 and shares some of the same parts, possibly the
coil it's self.

    I'm planning to bench test it prior to installing it in my bus as a
recirculation heater.  The problem I'm having is that the coil seems to have
died and will need to be replaced.  So here's the questions: Can this funny
shaped OEM 12V coil be replaced with a regular 12V ignition coil without any
ill effects (ie: burning up the glow/spark plug)???  Looking at the wiring
diagram and looking at the original part, it has the same typical terminals
(15+, 1- &amp; main charge (to spark/glow plug)) as any standard 12V coil.  It
seems to me that if the output of the OEM coil is similar to a standard
ignition coil, it &quot;should&quot; be o.k.  Anybody out there ever run a gas heater
using a standard ignition coil???  Anyone out there know about how much
output these coils have when they work??  If the OEM coil is the ONLY thing
I can safely use, does anyone have a good spare that they'd like to sell
me???

    Thanks for any help you all can offer.
