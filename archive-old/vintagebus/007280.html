That's bus karma for you. Keep your act clean, you never know when you'll
need it

Craig

&gt; it wasn't there until he looked back and freaked. We stopped and pulled
over
&gt; to look back, when all of the sudden, through the headlights of cars a few
&gt; hundred yards back, we saw the distinctive split windshield heading
straight
&gt; towards us. MY friend hit the gas and I jumped out running towards it.
After
&gt; a few seconds, I realized it was going at about 40 mph straight toward me,
I
&gt; panicked and stopped dead in my tracks. When it got about 30 yards from me
it
&gt; veered to the left and went into a ditch, taking out a wooden pole that
had
&gt; the whole freeway lined with barbed wire. The sound of that huge, hollow
body
&gt; hitting a pole made me yell a few words that I would rather not repeat. I
ran
&gt; up to the bus and saw that it was FINE, except for some paint stripped
off,
&gt; that revealed about 5 different colors.
