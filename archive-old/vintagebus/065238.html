&gt; any of you guys looking for 6 volt batteries
&gt; there are a couple on ebay
&gt; these are great i have used the optima before and its unreal how long they
&gt; last

I've also heard of premature failures and slow warranty adjustments
including Optima insisting that the failed battery be returned for
&quot;inspection&quot; before an adjustment was authorized.  Unless you really
_need_ the sealed technology, you're better off buying a Pep Boys battery
for 1/3 the price and putting it in a battery box.
