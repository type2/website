Subject: 1959 Westfalia SO-23 Interior FS

List:

The *most recent* '59 Westfalia purchase from the Northwest is far more rusty than I imagined.  My original intention on buying it was to make the stupid mistake once again to try and resurect it.  No one in their right mind would try and restore this bus.  So, I've yanked everything out, and I basically have a complete SO-23 interior.  Part of me wants to keep it and refinish it over time, but limited space and a bitchy wife might force me to sell it. It also came with a red/white tent w/privy room, partial poles (12), and a sloped roofrack.  These items might be for sale as well.  

Rather than tell you what is there, assume it is complete except for the following:

clamshells (ronnie has dibs)
water tank pump
headliner
forward cargo door panel
left side long panel

Other than that, it's all there, down to every curtain rod, coat hook and bracket, as well as the breadbox, 7 of the 10 tumblers, water tank, mint marble rear deck mat, etc.  Seats are yellow/black plaid, still has both wedge pillows.  It would in essence turn any Kombi automatically into an SO-23 Westy; done, finished, no more searching.  The cabinets will need to be re-veneered, a lot of it is peeling off.  The closet had a speaker cut into it, but since it needs to be re-veneered it doesn't matter.  It could all be used as is, or relaminated and refinished, but laminating new veneer skin isn't that tough, plus there are places that do it.  

I can bore interested parties with all of the details, so please pmail me.  I'd rather sell the bulk of it as a kit, and maybe piece out the accessories.  Then again, part of me would like to see as many SO-23 owners pick up those 1 or 2 pieces that they need to complete their camper.  I'm fearing tho that everyone needs the breadbox, or the clamshells, etc.  Hopefully it turns out that someone needs each and every piece.  I carefully removed the entire interior, and saved as many of the original fasteners as possible, in case David Mayes decides he wants it. :) As for paneling, I was able to salvage the bulkhead panel (which still has about 50% of the original Westfalia sticker still on it), the 2 rear corner birch panels, and the formica cargo door panel/table.

An opportunity to pick up an entire SO-23 interior won't happen very often.  I'm going to try it this way, i.e list offering, but if it gets too crazy with too much bloodshed, then I'll resort to Everett's classifieds, or, eep, eBay.

Best to reach me at    rdavis_at_sbch_dot_org

Robert
