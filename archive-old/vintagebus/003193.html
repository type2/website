 I have my wife's '67 beetle insured through J.C. Taylor, full
top of the line coverage, it's value is at $6000 full 
replacement.  It costs $75 bucks a &quot;YEAR&quot;.  No mileage
restriction, they haven't asked how many miles each year.
The policy restrictions are just like yours, not for daily to work 
use, vintage car oriented use, etc.  
 My '61 Westy, (bus content), will be with them also!
