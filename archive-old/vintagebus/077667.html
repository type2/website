Subject: known as DVD

guys-

a small story, and perhaps info that you guys can use as well...

frustration:

I do a bunch of business on the net. Buying and selling parts and cars for years now, domestically and internationally. i have not had any problems until recently , and for just $38.50.

i had emailed, and sent money for 2 pre-58 type 2 license lenses close to 6 months ago to somebody known as DVD on thesamba. there was a little communication via email in the beginning, and then nothing in the mail,  I had to hassle to get any kind of communication after feeling like nothing was going to happen...

&quot;its coming, i'll send you one next week, this and that&quot;...then nothing..still no lenses or a refund.

every now and then me sending emails reminding, asking, and left to wonder...with the ad still on thesamba.( as of a week ago or so)

someone had mentioned that he had not had any trouble with David at swap meets, and was curious about this story of mine...

I hate to use the forum, and i don't bad mouth anybody, but this instance is beyond being patient, and forgiving of time, other responsibilites of the seller, i am more than flexible, and understanding, but again there really is not an excuse... to ship a small package from cali to VA, its really that hard??

has anybody else had issues with this individual? no phone numbers were ever posted, just emails:
nosparts_at_hotmail_dot_com, nosparts.vw_at_verizon_dot_net...

thanks for listening
robert
56 DD panel...which still needs a license lens...
