Subject: RE: [VB] engine heating up/timing question

Did you check the deck height to see if maybe the new p/l set raised your
compression.

It also sounds like you have the timing to far retarded, this will cause an
engine to overheat faster then an engine to far advanced and harder
starting.

Set your timing at 28 degrees TOTAL adavance (009 with compufire). In the
last couple dyno runs we made we found that the engines made more power at
28 degrees verses 30 degrees total advance, less then 28 toal also lost
power.
Engine temps there seem to be in a decent range (could hold dipstick). I am
NOT saying this is where you should set it, just where I have found the best
results.

Hi All,
    I have a problem that is driving me nuts....1600 sp motor, has a
UO133XXXX case number so I think it's a type 3 motor. all stock except for a
blue coil, and a 009 distributor. I set the points gap at .016 and checked
it with a dwell meter, right at 50% ...so i think that is good. The problem
is that when the motor has been driven a while it gets pretty hot, and I
think the carb, fuel line is vapor locking. it doesn't want to start when
it's hot. I've tried messing with the timiong and i can make it run cooler
by advancing it ..I think...the timing mark moving clockwise in the timing
lght. , but then it pops and stuff under a load. I've tried setting it at 0,
5, 7.5 and 10 degrees BTC, but it still is getting pretty hot. The John Muir
book shows that motor should be timed at 0 degrees. Does that sound right to
you? It's been really hot here, 100 plus or minus 3 so i know it will get
warm, but i can't pull the dipstick out without burning my fingers. I just
put new pistons and cylinders in this motor ( because the number 3 piston
melted) so I'm trying to avoid doing it again....all of the tin is there. no
thermostat. I need to get one rounded up and will before winter. Any ideas
anyone? Something I'm not checking?
Thanks in advance...or retarded?
Jason
