 &gt;My '52 Standard has a drivers side sun visor which I haven't seen on many
 standard barndoors as well as rear corner body bumpers.
 &gt;
 The sun visor/mirror assembly is standard equipment on Standard and Deluxe
 models.  Note the welded on mounting bracket.
 
 The rear corner body bumpers were early Deluxes only before they decided on
 a &quot;real&quot; rear bumper (March, 1953).  It could have been an option or someone
 may have requested them installed or they could have been retrofitted.
 &gt;&gt;


also, this June 53 has no rear bumper- never had- no mounting holes, and no 
rear view mirror, no sunvisors. (never had them, no mounting holes in the 
headliners) no trim stuck on the rear corners,  I was thinking of getting 
some then decided nah it has enough cool options-  

heavy duty air cleaner (meaning strap top oil bong action - which was 
stanadrd in 54)  this option remained on list for ages, just that the air 
cleaner considered heavy duty changed

roof rack  (bolted to roof before headlliner install)

fresh air vent-  box sits on top abovecab-  look at &quot;a week at he factory&quot; 
for photos-  there are rows of BDs with this kind of vent.

so this last one would be barndoor only, as it was standard as of 3/55 to 
have a fresh air vent.    

M code *tag* wasn't used till about ch 398 000.  I did have an early 59 ( 
about chassis 440 000) that had no m code tag, still had the body number.
