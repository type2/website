 Hi Clara,
 The endplay new should be 0.07-0.13mm (0.0027-0.005&quot;), and the wear limit 
 (Meaning worn out.) should be 0.15mm (0.006&quot;).   Eric&amp;Barb
 
  &gt;&gt;

I wrote what I did as I have seen these numbers being slightly (.001&quot;) 
different from different sources, and I would not be sure exactly who would 
be the best source.  I would quote them , except I would have to look them up 
and see who said which.  Interesting, though that there is some variation 
from who you talk to, as small as it is.
