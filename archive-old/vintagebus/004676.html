Ok. I topped off my brake fluid reservoir the other day, by the way I have a
67 with a single circuit, not sure what kind. I have no pressure now and a
pile of brake fluid on the ground. So, apparently I have a leak. Question
is, is it easier to rebuild this one, which is probably a junk no name
brand..or just buy one of the single circuit ones from an earlier bus? I
have no money to go the dual circuit route, and was told earlier on the list
that a single circuit is the way to go. Any suggestions on where to order? I
have ordered from Wolfsburg West and BFY in the past, no problems, but I
have only ordered exterior parts. Thanks for any help.
