Subject: Rear Seat Clamps vs. Middle Seat Clamps

Anyone know if there's a big difference between the clamps for the rear
and middle seats?  As you can tell, my bus came with nothing in that
area.  I know the middle seat uses the plate/clamp/T-bolt.  Does the
rear use a plate?  Is the clamp the same?
