Subject: questions about a bus find

Today I looked at a '71 bus. It's a bus that is gonna need to be 
parted out. I need some of the rear-end stuff for a future IRS 
conversion of one of my 60's busses.

the cool thing is this bus has a corvair engine in it. condition is 
unknown. But I'm wondering about the actual conversion parts. Is 
there someone that sells a kit? If so, how much does it run? I'm 
trying to figure out so that if I buy the whole bus, I can figure an 
actual value of the parts. I'd probably hang onto the corvair engine 
and conversion parts for myself...but was just curious of value so I 
can deal on this junker.
