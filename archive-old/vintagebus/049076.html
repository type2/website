All:

I sent a post earlier today, but it doesn't appear to have posted so I'm sending this again.

I've decided to sell my all original Single Cab tilt, canvas and hoops.  It is complete:  both hoops, both hoop caps, center strap and canvas.  The canvas is in very nice condition.  All of the hardware is there, no missing pieces.  There is really no staining on the canvas to speak of and hardly any discoloration.  It has been in storage most of it's life.  The plastic window also is in nice shape with no cracks or tears.  All of the webbing straps are also there.  Hoops are original black paint and in great shape.  Again, everything is ORIGINAL.

Pmail for further info and price.  Pics available.  Trades are welcome, but I don't need much.  Thanks.

Robert
Santa Barbara, Cali
