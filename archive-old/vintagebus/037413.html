I remember driving my 64 sunroof bug down the freeway and seeing busses. I
thought they were crazy people. I was 16 I had the best looking bug with
original engine and miles, it was my dads before it was mine. It would be
worth a lot nowdays, if I hadnt let some idiot drive it and total it, but
thats another story......
I thought the bus was the stupidist idea ever. Underpowered, prone to fire
(like my bug wasnt somehow), slow etc.
So the bug died, and I got a dasher. It really moved for a 1500 cc engine.
But it really sucked.
Then something happened. My freind had a bus, and it was great. It had room
inside for fun, a bed and went everywhere.
I was hooked.
3 1967s, 2 1970s, 3 1969s, one 63. 
I currently drive a 63 and own a 70, a 69 and the 63. I love westy busses
more then ever.

My 63 is becomming a basket case, but so many people have put &quot;improvements&quot;
on it is wanting to live forever.
Jason
