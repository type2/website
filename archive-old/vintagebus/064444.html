Subject: Re: [VB] Tranny Question

If you're not looking to go a whole lot faster than 70, then go with a 3:88.
I had that done with my transmission and love it.  Good luck.

&gt; My son's 66 split-window has had a RGB go bad. I am going to bit the
bullet
&gt; and have both boxes rebuilt and the tranny replaced with a &quot;freeway
flyer&quot;.
&gt; Any sugeestions on  gearing./ One tranny rebuilder suggested a 3:08
another
&gt; sugessted 3:88. We just want to cruise 70 without the
&gt; RPM's maxing out. (I do not know if the bus has a 44mm or 39mm nut)
&gt; Thanks
