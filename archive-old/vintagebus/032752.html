 I'm thinking rear engine mount and or tranny mounts.  I haven't done 
 anything to the linkage but I now the coupler is tight and doesn't move and 
 all the shift rods and things have clearance.  Just wanting some advice to 
 the easiest/cheapest steps to try to solve this.  Should I start with 
 linkage or mounts?  I'm pretty sure I need tranny mounts!
 
 Sorry for the Saturday morning ramble
 Thanks in advance for a strategic battle plan

DOUPLECHECK THE COUPLER  OOPS SORRY FOR CAPS okay-fixed- ya check it again  
linkage is easier than tranny mounts.  how about shuft bushings?  new shift 
bushings are fun.

That said, I have a little stiffness shifting 1st/2nd in my 65, put NOS shift 
bushings in there, new tranny mounts, tranny was redone 17K ago, has new 
german coupling, but think something is a bit off in the tranny.  but its 
more of a slight irritation than a big problem, so I am doing nothing about 
it.
