Actually, the archives will reveal this very thought that I had over 14
months ago... that 1971 bus be my benchmark.

The numbers I have come up with show 5.375 R&amp;P with .82 4th gear, yielding
3845.9 RPM at 65MPH... assuming my identical 14&quot; 185R14 Metric size tires
(which I would have to cheat and do a 1970 bus, as in 1971 they changed the
lug pattern).

I happen to have a 1971 bus and 1970 bus in my collection :)

The 3845RPM number actually did NOT validate much... it basically is only
200RPM (at 65MPH) lower than the &quot;stock 1967 bus configuration&quot; of 4040RPM
at 65MPH.  But 200RPM IS a difference...

Although it sure doesn't seem that way driving my 1971 bus... perhaps my
numbers are based on incorrect assumptions or information.

As an aside...  just putting on larger tires (like 215) will make up the
200RPM difference and drop you to what a 1971 bus would have had :)  So
those of you with 1964-1967 splittys who want a simple solution... run
larger rear tires (which you probably would consider anyway given they are
easier to find and often cheaper).

OK... back to the 3845RPM figure.  Only 200 RPM less than a splitty? Then I
started to realize that VW didn't design the engine/transaxle combination
for longevity and highway cruising alone... they had several factors:  1)
had to be drivable in both CITY and highway, 2) US drivers WANT
ACCELERATION, 3) keeping cost low.

It is pretty obvious to me that the Type2 would have benefited from a 5
speed gearbox  A .75 5th gear would be really nice.  Bottom line is that it
costs extra money and would have raised the initial cost of the Type2.... it
probably would save the owner in terms of gas cost and wear and tear on
engine... but most purchasers focus in initial cost... and VW knew that.

I think the evidence shows that VW catered to the USA market's demand for
&quot;acceleration over cruising&quot; by going with the Type IV aluminum engine in
1972.   It raised the cost considerably, while in many places outside the US
they kept on selling the 1600cc magnesium engine all the way up into the
early Vanagon!

My $.02.  If you add all up my $.02 on the topics, I'm sure it is well over
$12.62 by now.

What is the gearing listed for that ~70 manual?

My views was to increase my gearing in the old split
with 1600 only to the point where VW did...the last
1600s in US buses was 70-71...and they had the best
gearing for speed....thus I would like to change my
split gearing to those bus specs....that way I am
staying within VW spec recomendations for a 1600
sp...make sense?

Let us (me) know what that gearing is in the `70 and I
wonder what the final gearing in 4th on a `70 is
compared to the final gearing in 4th on a `66-`67?

Curious?
