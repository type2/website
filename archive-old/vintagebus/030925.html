What's &quot;web&quot;?  Is that the thing rich people have on their newfangled tvs?

I get the list through the fillings in my teeth.  I respond by clicking
my teeth together; each tooth is a letter of the alphabet.  I'm worried

m, r, s, and x.

This message took me 10 minutes to &quot;type&quot;.
