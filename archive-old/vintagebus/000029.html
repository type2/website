    I just received my 55-58 deluxe interior swatches from Upholstery Haus in 
Tempe AZ.  I have to say that I am impressed with the brown vinyl used on 
seats and the top and bottoms of the interior panels.  It is spot on in 
color, texture semi matt finish.
The sample for the middle portion of the interior panels was very close to 
the original as well. 
    I would like to know how much the bulk material cost, and if the middle 
color material comes with heat seams. 
    I am pleased with the samples and will order some material in the near 
future.  I will use it to fill in the gaps in my original interior, namely 
the parcel tray material and for the rolled top portion of the bulkhead.
    I do not know doug, but I must say he puts out a nice product.
