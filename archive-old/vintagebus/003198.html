Subject: French Canadians Rock
Date: Mon, 30 Oct 2000 17:54:51 -0600
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

subject says it all - French Canadians are about the coolest people
anywhere.  There are French Canadians anywhere in the world you go -
anywhere!  And a more down to earth and unassuming people you just CANNOT
find.  They have a certain spirit that is really hard to pin down - John
Steinbeck sort of captured it in &quot;Travels With Charlie.&quot;  I'm 100%
Irish/English Canadian so I'm not a francophone - I'm just a bit of a
Francophile.

I do think it is inappropriate to slam someone because the don't speak
'merican.
