The shift bushing in the front of my early 59 single and late 59 double
both were split so you could put it on the assembled rod.The bushing is
split as well it has a hole that fit into a locating pin in the tube so
it would not slide or rotate.I think this is correct if not lemme' have
it

 Hi all,
 
 I'm trying to replace the front shift rod bushing
 on my '59 panel.  This requires removing the front
 shift rod from the front coupler.  The set screws
 came out easily but I'm having trouble getting the
 coupler loose from the shift rod.
