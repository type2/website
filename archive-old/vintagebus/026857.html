Hello all,

Speaking of front emblems, how the heck do you get the clip on the top one?  Get you 2 y/o to put her hand up there?  I'm
not a contortionist.

Also, I saw mentioned the other day putting insulation in a bus.  I know they make fiberglass insulation sealed in those
bags, but is it thin enough to fit behind the panels?
Anyone have a better suggestion? Should the insulation be sealed off behind a plastic sheet like on the front doors?
Thanks
jon
