Subject: [VB] Fuse box retaining clip

Anybody know where I can get a fuse box retaining clip?  I've got a cover on
the fuse box but I don't want to risk a short if it pops out. Thanks,

I'm a stickler for engine vibration. If you had it balanced and it vibrates
more than a stock I'd be popping that puppy out and tearing it down. It
could be as simple as one cylender not having the same compression ratio as
the rest, but if it was &quot;professionally&quot; assembled, you'd think deck height
and head cc'ing would be part of the job. I have also seen a rod in upside
down or a piston upside down causing vibration, but not really noticable. I
don't know, but if you don't want a box of extra parts, I wouldn't leave it
in that condition. IMHO

Subject: [VB] retarded


My 300 mile engine is running too hot I fear. On the hills 240+ (I stop and
cool down at 240). I received an e-mail last night that recommended I retard
the timing a bit to run cooler. I time it at 28 degrees max advance. Vac
advance distributor.

Then today I found this in the archives:

&lt;&lt;&lt;The biggest problem I find with VW's is the use of a timing light to set
the timing of a non-stock engine. On a weekly basis I have VW's coming in
the shop complaining about heat and/or running problems, after I look at it
the first thing I do is advance the timing a few degrees and that usually
solves the problem. Most non stock VW engines that I see are running to
retarded, which in turn causes them to run hot. The only time I use a timing
light is to check the timing after I have set it by ear, so I know where to
set it if I need to make changes to something and to check the advance if
the dizzy. Using a timing light to set the timing on a NON STOCK engine is a
NO NO, but to each there own. &gt;&gt;

What is the answer?

Another subject: There definitely is a rpm dependant vibration in the beast.
Pisses me off as I spent a lot of money having the whole thing balanced
before I assembled it. How long till this engine flies apart?
