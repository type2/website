Subject: Breakdown  in 59 SC  (F)
Message-ID: &lt;f002b9c9.24c03fd4_at_aol_dot_com&gt;

I was driving my the 59 single cab I had last year, but as I was cruising 
north on I -5 it suddenly seemed to lose power, choke and cough,  and I 
pulled over to the side of the road.   I opened up the treasure chest door 
and out jumped two guys wearing nothing but raincoats.   They stepped to the 
back of the truck and exposed themselves to oncoming traffic.   Amazingly 
quickly a police car showed up and the cop demaded what was going on.  I told 
him my truck had broken down.   &quot;But who are these guys?&quot;  he said, pointing  
&quot;Oh, they are my emergency flashers.&quot;  I replied.
