&gt;&gt;Could some one point me to a 115v compressor that can be used to sand &amp;
&gt;&gt;paint a bus?  How much cfm or scfm will I need?  The random oribal

&gt;&gt;18+cfm to spray paint.
&gt;
&gt;18 cfm with a 110v compressor? I don't think this is possible is it?

I don't know much about how much air you need, but I agree with Kevin
that you probably won't get that much from a 117 V compressor.  Looking
at Campbell Hausfeld's site, the 117 V ones are rated around 5 to 6 SCFM
at 90 PSI.  Only the 234 V ones are rated in excess of 10 CFM at 90 PSI.

Note that many compressor horsepower ratings are against the law, at
least according to this guy:

A Google lead me to http://truetex_dot_com/aircompressors.htm which has
some good info abot compressor ratings.  I didn't know what an SCFM
was before and now I do.

&gt;Can't you _make_ a 220v circuit using 2 110v circuits?

It is possible, but not recommended - it is against the National
Electrical Code in the US.  If somebody was going to die without
234 V, sure, I'd rig it up, but as a regular practice it's not
a good idea.  Also, if &quot;landlord&quot; means an apartment, it's possible
that there isn't any 234 V to be had - it's 208 V or some other
voltage.
