Well, I got to play with my new truck this saturday and it was fun.  I am
replacing some preaty inexpensive items that should make a some
difference in runability and lastability.  Thanks for peoples comments
that the clunking in the front was the shocks-bulls i.  

Anyway the PO which is quickly turning into a DPO put some plywood on the
bed-you know, to protect it?!?!  It is rusty under there.  There is rust
through up toward the cab and it crawls a little up the cab wall and there
is a little rust through above the engine.

So I am thinking, get the whole bed cut out of there and put some spanking
new corrigated steel down to replace it.  I am not a welder so someone
else would do the work.  
Question is what is the fesability on doing this?  It looks to me that one
could just cut all the way around the perimeter and take the bed out of
there then measure it and stick a new bed in.  All the beams underneath
the bed are rust free and suprisingly the cargo area is not too rusty at
all.  I know that you cant see my truck, but for those of you who have had
&quot;outsiders&quot; do welding, how is the cost?

Thanks
rami
