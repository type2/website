Subject: Re:  Busses for sale- roof jumping
Message-ID: &lt;a169d974.24677106_at_aol_dot_com&gt;

was writ:

Needs tires as they are flat or missing Hit in the nose, rocker and corner
rust, and the roof looked jumped on.
The other was a 1960 two-tone microbus Mango Green and Sea Gull Grey, missing
middle seat, roof jumped on, complete interior, pretty nice condition. again
- - - - - -
rumor has it that large snow fall and the weight thereof can dent in a bus
roof, hence the &quot;jumped on&quot; look.   (is this a fad?  like shag carpet?  the
mountain / northern look? will people do this on purpose as a 'resto'?)
