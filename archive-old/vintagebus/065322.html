&gt; The H*nda Element is the New Bus, they beat VW to it.
&gt; A lot of parallels to the original T2, but with air bags, modern stuff.
&gt; 1. It's homely

Beauty is in the eye...

&gt; 2. Small outside, big inside

As big as it can get with crush space.

I measured, and the exterior dimensions are within a couple of inches of
my bay in length and height.  It is 5 inches wider, though.

&gt; 3. Proven drivetrain from other lines, no excess HP

160HP would be a screamer in a bus!

&gt; 4. Cheap (18k-21k)

Well, after the Honda dealers stop putting the &quot;Additional Markup&quot;
stickers on.

&gt; 5. Boatloads of passenger cars sold, loyal customers

An aging customer base, hence the &quot;college geek&quot; target market for this.

&gt; 6. Great dealership support

Depends.  Some Honda dealers are great, some are arrogant SOBs.

&gt; 7. Appeals to young people

And older folks too.  Even though this was billed as a &quot;mobile dorm room&quot;,
I bet they sell more to the 30+ crowd.

&gt; 8. Rear windows pop out

Didn't like that.  Had to be that way to make room for the B-pillar
structure in the rear doors.

&gt; 9. Camping gear available

No kidding!  There is a tent that clips onto the rear hatch.  Not as nice
as a Westy tent, but still...

&gt; 10. Same 'minuses' as T2, road noise &amp; skittish in winds

Yes, but only to those who aren't used to buses.  I'll bet that a bus
pilot wouldn't notice the noise or crosswinds.

&gt; 11. Utilitarian, flexible seating &amp; easy cleanup
&gt; etc.

Seating is only for four, darnit.  I do like the rubber mats and
anti-stain fabric in the seats.

&gt; Unless VW's New Bus can hit more than 5 of the above including #4, I'd say
&gt; H*nda is going to move a lot of these!

That they will.  My wife wants to look at one.  I feel an expense coming
on.

The bus stays, though.  No negotiation there.
