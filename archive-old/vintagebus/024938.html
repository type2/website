Subject: preheat/aircleaner swap on 65
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

I had picked up this funky altered air cleaner at a swap.  Your regular 1500 
bus air cleaner that hangs on the right side of the engine compartment in my 
65, but... instead of the small preheat nozzle, someone had brazed on a 
larger one from a bay window that takes the same diameter tube at the fresh 
air tubes.

Seeing as preheat is VITAL, and even in this warm (60s), dry (only about 70% 
humidity) weather, the humidity is high enough that you can see the 
condensation appear and feel the cold throat of the manifold, figured I'd 
swap it.  More warm air preheat is better, right?   People in other weathers 
may disagree, just come on over, particularly in fall winter or spring.

SO I pulled the air cleaner, the rear tin, and the preheat pick up pipe on 
the right side, and the small under tin on the right side.

Installed the bay window/68 later bug preheat pick up pipe (big diameter), 
the small tin (oops, remove pick up pipe, tin must go on first).  The little 
tin I had before had a oval hole for the pick up pipe, but this pipe needed a 
notch to fit, so i dug in a box of engine bits for one) found a nice rear tin 
to match, installed that, found another little preheat cover for the left, 
put that on.  Cleaned out the new air cleaner bucket, new  clean oil goes in, 
clip that in place,   used a plastic fresh air hose on the right side (better 
if a fan belt breaks) installed one old fresh air tube as the preheat tube, 
put the left preheat tube in place, made sure everything is there.  Pretty 
tidy actually.

now the flap on the pre heat doesn't open until higher rpms, but it does open

comments?  horrors?
