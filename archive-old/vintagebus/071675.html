&gt;no prob, says i, end play is a piece of cake!

&gt; as i am trying out 3 shims (24,24, 30, the same as on the last 
&gt; crank/fw),

&gt; end play - which WAS at .07mm now reads to .013 - .015, the limits
&gt; any ideas why this would change?

.07mm is .070 mm, and much more than .013-.015mm.
Endplay is .07 to .13mm ( 0.0027&quot;-0.0051&quot;)
Let's assume you mean .13mm as installed.
Where did you take that final measurement ?
If you found a better measurement (and procedure), 
fitted the proper shims, installed the main seal
and torqued the nut, did you check the endplay again ?
Did you add a paper or metal sealing gasket
and not verify the additional endplay ?
