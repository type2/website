&gt; Funny thing I've noticed about CA titles and regs. when it comes to
trucks.....most 1/2 or 3/4 ton trucks are registered as &quot;commercial&quot;
vehicles on the title.  My 93 Ford p/u had the same &quot;commercial&quot; on the
title.  Also had a 62 Singlecab in Vegas with a &quot;commercial&quot; CA pink
slip.

The way the byzantine CA regs work, a &quot;housecar&quot; is a passenger vehicle.
The definition of &quot;housecar: varies, but generally a camper interior that
cannot be removed easily qualifies.  You can get a passenger licence for a
pickup if it has a permanently mounted camper, but if you take the camper
off you have to reregister it as a commercial vehicle (with higher fees)
