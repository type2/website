Subject: Re: [VB] Fixin' the crunch:  Door fitting

the workshop manual has those pictures of the bus with measurements in mm on 
it... in the 'replacing body parts' section.  I can scan them for you if you 
dont have the book

Section A 21 to A 24

I have the new door on, with window frame bolted in, and I have certain
adjustments I seem to be able to make, but the long and short of it is that
the upper corner of the window frame contacts the upper door jamb.  The
upper rear part of the window frame is down about 3/8&quot;.  The rear seam (door
to pillar) is fairly straight, but a teensy bit wide.  The lower part of the
door is impossible to tell at this point...it looks close, but there is no
dogleg.  The front edge of the door to pillar area is pretty mucked
up...twisting and warping in the accident made measurements and such sorta
impossible.

Any clues?

If I can twist the front hinge-bearing pillar so that the upper front door
corner doesn't contact the frame, then I visualize the rear upper corner
dropping more.  I am stymied...but I'm gonna go back out and mess with it
some more.
