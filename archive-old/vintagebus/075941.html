&lt;&lt; #1) Wear Gloves
 #2) Wear Eye Protection &gt;&gt;


I might have said this before, but do consider getting a box of latex gloves. 
  It is really nice to just peel off the gloves and not have oil/scum on my 
hands.   For the greasey jobs like a suspension lube I use the nitrile (blue) 
gloves, as the latex gets soft and falls apart when all covered with grease.  
Also nitile ones are good against solvents, like when cleaning a carb.   I 
found nitrile gloves for $5 a box of 100 at Harbor Freight, and they are fine for 
people with latex allergies.   

do use eye protection.  A couple years ago I got a piece of metal in my left 
eye when grinding, it got past the goggles at a funny angle.   I was really 
worried as that's my good eye, I have a blind spot in my right eye.    It 
didn''t start bothering me until hours later.  It was girls night at my house, and 
we had kicked out the guys and were drinking Par de Sho:tz and watching Bandit 
Queen and some other girl power movie and it started hurting and watering and 
I was in the bathroom couldn't get the da^&amp; sliver out, even though I could 
see it in the mirror,.  (there was a splinter of metal stuck in my eyeball)   
when Chris came home and drug me off to the emergency room, and the doctor got 
it out really quick (how'd he do that?) so it stopped hurting but watered even 
more.  I was all hammered, it was pretty funny when they had me do the vision 
test.   Anyway, it would have been bad if it did permanent damage.  Now I have 
a face sheild.

When working with fumey chemicals for Pete's sake do it somewhere ventilated 
so you share the fumes with everyone else (dilute dilute)
