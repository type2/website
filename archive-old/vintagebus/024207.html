Subject: Walkthru Seat Back Panels &amp; Rubber
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

My '67 Deluxe Hardtop was 90% complete when I got it. 
The PO has done the entire interior in black. He even 
removed the interior walkthru seat back panels that have 
the tight curve on them. I found a nice black vinyl for 
the material (cheap too!), but am wondering what suggestion 
does anyone have for the material underneath. The 
seat has a farily tight corner, so the hard board usually 
used as a backing for panels may not work. 

You can see the area in question on Pete's bus, 
This is how stock is supposed to look. Mines bare.

fourth picture down. I like the idea of vinyl flooring, 
I may have to look into that. 

PO also removed the rubber material at the base of the 
seat, so I need to find a replacement for that too. 
Also, what is supposed to be on the floor between the seats? 
Any suggestions? 

The divider trim between the panel and rubber is there, but 
the PO tried to remove it. Painted yellow, but there. 

The PO intended to use a loose weave black carpet on 
the floor. Fortunately, he hadn't installed it. 
It has already been installed in the rear cargo area, and 
having cleaned it up once, I would not want to clean the 
whole floor area after a period of use. I'll stick to rubber. 
Th eurg collects and shows every bit of gunk on it. 

The divider strip (I can't remember what it's called) between 
the headliner and the walls is white and installed. 
Any suggestions on what to use to alter it to black? It 
looks out of place in white.
