Subject: New engine - Old Carb

I just finished installing all of the components on my new 1600cc engine and
put it in my 66 walkthrough camper.  With a new engine, I expected it to
start right up.  Not the case.  The carb looks shot since the car sat for 7
years with about 2 gallons of gas in the tank(I already replaced the tank).
Anyway, I poured gas into the car with a small cup thinking that I would at
least get it to kick over a few times.  Nothing.  This perplexes me since I
feel that a minimal explosion should have occurred.  Everything else checks
out fine.    Should pouring gas in the mouth of the carb been enough for an
explosion or was it a futile attempt with a bad carb?  Any
comments/suggestions are appreciated.
