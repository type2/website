Subject: Re: Bus Books

From: wilden1_at_juno_dot_com

&gt;I've never found the book but I've been told that the book ends with the
&gt;fellow having traveled over 60,000 miles in about three years and his bus
&gt;burns in front of a Texas roadside cafe near Lubbock Texas while he's
&gt;inside eating.
&gt;The cause of the fire was a tumbleweed blowing under his van and igniting
&gt;from the exhaust heat.

That sounds like a cross between &quot;Divine Right's Trip&quot; and the Fabulous Furry Freak Brothers.  I recall at least one FFFB episode ending with a 
&lt;foom!&gt; as a tumbleweed ignites under the bus.  Actually pretty amazing that I remember *any* FFFB episode....

&quot;Divine Right's Trip&quot; is a pretty interesting read.  Amazon lists it at http://tinyurl_dot_com/endi.  Or google it for some reviews.  I found a used copy and 
would definitely recommend it, both because of and in spite of its strangeness.
