Hi paul,first you have to deciede what you need in a welder .
Mac and Snap-on are good but for a hobbist is just too expensive ( very 
expensive)
sears is good if you can catch one off thier sales and also their warenty.
harbor frieght catalog is good to compare welders (they usually  list about 
10)and you can see what the spec are on the differnt models.
it really depends on what you want to do with the machine.
you need to know what the #'s and specs meen
one of the most important specs is (duty Cycle)% you want it to be as high a 
% as possible.
for example you'll see a welder for 199.00 but the duty cycle is 6% or 10%
the same size welder with a name brand is probably 30% but its $499
a top of the line with near 90% or 100% duty cycle  is $ 1600  ( just off the 
top of head)

now for a little welding on the side on your own vehicles you really dont 
need to go to the professonal welder, the 30% duty cycle will get you thru.
but stay away from the ones with the 6% or 10%.

Im assuming you want a MIg welder for rust repair on your bus . i bought a 
small mig at the large swap meet we have here in NJ a couple of year back.
it was from a vender that only delt in migs, he had them all lined up in his 
tent all size ranges.  prices were not bad.

the Carlisle show is coming up and so is the Englishtown show in one or two 
weeks.
hope this helped.
