&gt;VERY FAMILIAR vw sound ....

I wonder if your '71 had a pea shooter exhaust...like the ones on bugs. My 
double cab had a pea shooter shoved in it when I got it. I changed it out 
for a regular bus pipe when I installed the rear bumper. I actually don't 
like the sound at all....liked it much better with the &quot;bug&quot; sound.

One of these days I'm gonna install a merged exhaust and stinger onto the 
truck. Might as well make it sound like it looks.
