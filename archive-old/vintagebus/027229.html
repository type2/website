its not roomy but its nowhere near as bad as getting the upper nut by
the starter on.

Don't get me started on that mother!!!  My arm is still uncurling from
Saturday. When I finally got it in there though I use my tried and true
technique for putting the nut on. I use a thin straight slot screwdriver
and fit it into the threads on the bolt.  Then with my other hand I
start the nut, once it's started you can let go with the screwdriver.
