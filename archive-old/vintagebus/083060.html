Subject: Re: [VB] re:speaking of oil

From Kevin Guarnotta:

 Do our engines really run a lot hotter than a engine made today? I'm trying
to imagine these new cars with their 250+ HP engines running cooler then my
 ~60 hp engine.

 I'm not trying to start an oil fight, I just don't understand that...
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Yes, they do. Modern engines rely on water to cool them. With a 180 or 195 themostat, that is the temp range
they run in....rarely over 200.

But an air cooled engine relies on air to cool them which is subject to ambient temperature changes.
On a hot day, the engine runs hot and so does the oil. Above 212 oil temp and the polymers in dino multi grade
breakdown.
