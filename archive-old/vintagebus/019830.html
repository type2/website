&gt;I've never seen said haole.

This was a Hawaiian bus? ;-)

Regarding the addition of bay stuff to vintagebus_dot_com, put me in the No Thanks column.  Pedantic discourse follows:

First, on the Web, location is irrelevant.  A simple pointer to a site containing Bay &amp; later stuff is almost exactly the same as having that info &quot;on your site&quot;.  I can't 
count the number of times people have tried to get me to create a web page of collected links &amp; info that are available (and maintained) elsewhere because they don't 
get the Web.  Thom, I'd say if you care to host/publish some original Bay content that is not found elsewhere on the web, go for it.  Working that content into a logical 
information architecture alongside split stuff is a whole 'nother issue, and the twain needn't be related.

Second, &quot;vintagebus&quot; means whatever you want it to mean, whether it's a style or a year designation -- but I think splits probably feel a lot more &quot;vintage&quot; than bays 
to most people.  There's a note on the vintagebus_dot_com site that explains the usage of vintage in that context.  If 68-up resources are out there (yours or others) and 
you want to link to them, I'd point to at least a separate starting point (&quot;Looking for 68-up information?  Try this link...&quot;) to get users cognitively &quot;off the vintagebus 
site&quot; and into a Baywindow information space, regardless of URL.  People pay WAY too much information to URLs  - thinking they are top-level categories.  Like 
suggesting its street address has jacksh*t to do with the contents of a library.  Authoritative, easy-to-understand domain names are for Les Clueless (so says Mr. Tilde 
Username).

Third, there's the aforementioned conceptual muddling.  While the engine of a 71-down bay certainly has overlap with splits, not much else does.  So do you leave 
out the 72-79's?  If you include them, isn't a vanagon powertrain close enough to include, too (at least the AC ones)?

Fourth, there's a TON of info out there on bays already.  Maybe someone just needs to step forward and create a good entry portal for it - an annotated bibliography.  
And maybe the rest of us need to polish our search skills.

I have a bay and a split, and I love them both, Kyle ;-).  But there's so much info on both types that a single site containing all of it would be a nightmare to design, 
maintain, and navigate.  Comprehensive information under one roof is a _pre-Web_ notion.
