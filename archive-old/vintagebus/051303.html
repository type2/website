Subject: Re: [VB] Stripped Threads, oil drain plate

&gt;From: John Baker&lt;jbakerccymca_at_springmail_dot_com&gt;
&gt;Date: Mon, 04 Feb 2002 10:36:47 -0500
&gt;
&gt;On an old 1600 DP engine I'm working on, I have discovered that one of the 
&gt;holes where the studs that hold on the oil drain plate is stripped out.

This happened to one of the studs on my Dad's Bug (1600 DP, AH case).
The VWFLAPS sold us a &quot;step stud&quot; which is just a stud that is larger
on one end than the other.  We had to go to the local True Value 
hardware store to get the matching tap, and we found that they also
had the step studs.  I think the &quot;normal&quot; end is 6mm to match the
existing oil plate nuts and the &quot;big&quot; end is 8mm to go into the newly
drilled and tapped hole in the engine case.

The tap should come with an indication of what size drill you need to
use.  It will probably list both metric and inch drill sizes -- if
the inch size is an oddball, get a drill bit that size too.

When you actually drill the case, be careful.  The alloy is soft and
tends to &quot;grab&quot; the drill bit -- the one on Dad's Bug is a little
crooked for this reason.  If you have the bare case and a drill
press it will fit under, use that.  Otherwise just be careful.

The last time this came up on the list, I think someone mentioned the
option of drilling the case hole all the way through, then using a
long 6mm stud and a locknut inside the case.  I'm not sure about the
details on this, though.

Good luck!

Matt Roberds
