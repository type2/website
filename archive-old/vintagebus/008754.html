&gt; well, I cleaned up the threads on the guage ground with a tap (it was
pretty
&gt; crusty, actually)  and reconnected everything, still acts wierd,  The temp
&gt; guage reads 270 when I turn the key to on, and the oil pressure reads
zero.
&gt; Start the bus, the oil temps guage goes to the lowest on the scale (150 is
&gt; where it starts) and the oil temp reads above 80 psi.  If I rev the motor
the
&gt; oil temp rises slightly, then dips back to still very high above 80- when
the
&gt; engine idles.  One guy posted his does the same thing.  Hmmm. BTW, in the
&gt; other bus the guages did not do this, senders are pretty new,  oil sender
&gt; /guage checked out a year ago and read consistant from then.
&gt;
&gt; I have had 2 (two)  responses on the spice rack query, one said the top of
&gt; the SO-42 spice rack is the fakey wood, the other said it is the white
with
&gt; the grey hatches like the tables that fold up.  Looked through the
galleries
&gt; at vintagebus_dot_com, samba_dot_com, joe clarks tent pages, even something else,
&gt; found loads of westys, even a number of pics which showed spice racks, but
&gt; not a durned one showed the TOP of the spice rack with the little flap
that
&gt; flips up.  All from straight on.
&gt;
&gt; ya, the spice rack I have is missing that top layer.
&gt;
&gt; I think I'm going with the white/hatched stuff.
