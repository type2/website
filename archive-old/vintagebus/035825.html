Two questions here. I want to paint my bus yellow below the belt and white

on the top. Question I have is is it true that some colors are harder/more

expensive to paint than others? I plan to either do it myself or have it

done, whichever seems more viable. I have no experience except with model

car painting, which I'm sure is much different. Other question is, everyone

around here I've talked to about bodywork says

fiberglass,fiberglass,fiberglass. I read in auto magazines and books about

the 'old fashioned way with lead'. What gives here? It seems here in

Michigan people would want to do things that way, seems it would last

longer, here in the salt belt. Thanks for any help.

I painted my 65 westy a year ago, with much help from a couple friends.   The
paint has some rocks chips now, some rust coming through in a couple places,
and one or two bubbles.     No show car, but it does look 5000% better than it
did before and I am sure will rust less for the protection.    It's a driver.
The key to a good paint job is prep.   In this case it meant da sanding and
bangin dents out and a cool hydraulic thingy to push out the side where the
bus had laid over and mushed in just a tad at the drivers pillar by the
bulkhead some rust repair and using bondo and spot putty and time and energy.
I spent about $500 in supplies- paint and various chemicals and filters for
better breathing and sanding supplies and rust repair pieces and new window
seals, used ppg paint- they were very nice about mixing stock colours to code
for me, and remixing the bluewhite which was off (I took it back after
spraying the bus and having a fit that it came out too green).   I had never
done this before and it was very nice that someone could show me how it works.
Not that they were experts.  It did make a big difference temperature and
humidity when painting- it was raining outside when we did the green and it
came out better than the white which was done when it was dry outside.
