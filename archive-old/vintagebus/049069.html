Ev sez:
&gt; I was wondering if anyone has any information about the so-called &quot;side-loader&quot; Single Cab.

I've seen the pics in one of my books, Sammler-Schatz or 50 years of the Transporter, or ?  It was cut behind the cab down to the floor and had a bed in the back. I've never seen a real one. 

Wiper motors. I put bay wipers in my '63 DC, with a beetle side-mount motor on the mechanism.  Caveats, The ashtray won't fit with the bay mech.! Shorten the ashtray or leave it out. The sweep area of a bay is wider than a split. Shorter bug wiper arms will touch each side, but won't get the upper 2 inches of the glass. You can shorten the drive arms to reduce the sweep and longer blades to wipe taller, but I didn't. If you do, cut 'em and use slots to bolt the drive arms back together so you can adjust the sweep. 
Some installation notes: Use a '69 or later bay donor, '68 is one year only arms and shafts. Get all the wires to the fusebox too. Yank out those plastic defrost tubes so you can get to the mech. 
Pull the bay wiper motor off at the junkyard and fit the beetle motor while you're there to ensure a fit. The motor will press against the bracket a bit without problems, just tighten it up. The bug motor mounts 90 deg. and clears the dash. Get the bug wiper arms and nut covers, make sure they fit the shafts. The bug motor is smaller, but you're using bug sized arms and wipers.  
Mount with two rubber washers, inside and outside. If you're in rain country, use a sealant too. No room for a proper grommet in the body. Adjust the inside nut so the wiper arm body doesn't hit the wiper indent. I should have given mine another 1/4&quot; from stock. The only mounting points are the shafts and a stiff wire to the dash you have to add. I used an existing hole that looked like a switch mounting hole, you can use a ty-wrap to a slot. Idea is to pull it away from the defrost tubes a bit. Turn on the wipers and adjust the defrost tubes with a long screwdriver or punch and a hammer to stop the rubbing. It doesn't take much, 1/4&quot; here and there. Pull on the dash wire/wrap to stop most of the scraping before the impact adjustments. 
Wiring. One of the wires goes to an always-on terminal, it's the one that parks and stops by using an internal switch. There will be 3 other speeds, select one you like and connect it to the key-on wiper switch circuit. Put in a another switch to get other speeds, or plug in different wires for the season. 
I may go to a '67 mech when I can because the safari windows require a smaller sweep and I like having an ashtray.
