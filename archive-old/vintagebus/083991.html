Subject: Re: [VB] dumb question: is there an &quot;easy&quot; way to lower
  compression?

Hi Conrad,
IF the engine has much less than 1,000 miles on it since it was  rebuilt.  
One can install shims under the cylinders.
  IF not then one can install shims between the cylinders and heads,  but 
these can cause problems.  The only other way is to have the heads hemi  cut or 
remove material and cc the head chambers yourself.
