Subject: Re: [VB] 1964 Bus gearing question

Hi Richard,
At this point trying to figure out which gearing your bus came from the  
factory is a moot point after 40 years and who knows how many DPOs and bad  
mechanics.  Our 1960 walk thru panel camper conversion came to us with a  tranny 
that hit 3,000 RPM  in fourth gear at 35 MPH, and topped out at 45  MPH with the 
pedal floored!  Which is most likely the reason the DP 1600  that came with 
this bus had a rod sticking out the top of the engine case.   The DPO probably 
was doing about 5,500 RPM to do just the 55 MPH nationwide  speed limit of the 
time.
  So either you need to have your tranny taken apart or tach the  tranny for 
where it hits 1,500 and 3,000 RPM in 1-4th gears and figure out the  gearing 
with some math.  Even if you do have the former done it is a good  idea to do 
the taching so with the new tranny you can see the  changes.
  We are running a 3.875 R&amp;P and .82 fourth geared freeway  flier and are 
happy with the results with a SP 1641cc 69mm CW  cranked engine.  We are looking 
at going to a longer stroked  CW crank in the future to provide for more 
torque for a little better hill  climbing.  The higher the RPM the more the torque 
will drop off which is  not what one wants with a bus engine.
  If you want to, (and anyone else interested) Pmail us for the  tranny 
modification info we wrote up on our experience with tranny  gearing.
