Subject: Re: [VB] Spring plate angle - lost settings...

Hehe Paul,

I'm also in the midst of reseting and replacing a torsion bar. Having done
the adjustment several times over the years, if you have the Sears
magnetic angle indicator, like I do, then you're on your way to success.
The angle difference required between the 'level' parts of your body and
the hand=lifted spring plate is 20 degrees, plus or minus 1/2 degree. It's
an easy and straightforward thing to measure the upper rain gutter edge or
the rocker panel edge or the the frame main runner to get your first
reading, regardless of whether or not the bus is level. Then you measure
the lower edge of the hand-raised spring plate. The difference should be
20, if not, then it works like this:

Moving one outer spline either way is 7.5 degrees. Rotating the bar to
change to the next spline internally is 8.16 degrees. The difference is 40
minutes of arc, or 2/3 of a degree, making for fine adjustment ability.

You move the bar one spline in one direction, then go to the next spline
in the opposite direction with the spring plate. Your gain will be 2/3
degree. You divide the difference in your angle readings by 2/3 degree to
get how many times you have to do the double spline move. Easy. Think it
out for a minute, and you'll see it. Grease both ends of the torsion bars
splines well with anti-sieze, so the next time, in 20 years, it'll come
apart easily. If you need more help, email me.

&gt; On a positive note, my spring plates do look nice now as do the spring plate
&gt; covers!
