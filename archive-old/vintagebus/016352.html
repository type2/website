Worries prior to starting: right king pin worn, right reduction gearmissing
bolt, and I always worry about the engine, especially under such a loadfor
that distance.
Damages upon arriving in WA:  Right red. gear leaking fluid badly, fried
parking light wires, front bumper even more messed up, no rear brakes,
starter sometimes works, exhaust leak in left heat exchanger, and dogpuke
in my jacket.Lag I
     After a few hectic days trying to restore my front brakes withDave,
adjusting my carb. with Derek, fixing my heater with Snoopy, and workingout
a few other bugs, we felt we were ready.  Immediately after graduationfrom
school, we took off.  After the first three hours we had to gas up, andthe
starter wouldn't work.  So I reached in the back of the bus for mytools,
and dropped them on the ground as soon as I got them out of the bus.They
were so hot that I had to wait a few minutes before I could use them.We
later found out that a candle hat melted around one of Kelly's shoes ina
cardboard box.  I isolated the rear heater heat exchanger.  I checked afew
things, but to no avail.  No big deal, busses are easy to push.  At thenext
gas stop, the bus wouldn't idle.  I had to keep my foot on the gas anduse
the E-brake to stop.  Once we got to the foothills of the Appalachians,we
pulled into a rest stop and got some sleep, only to wake up parked in bya
couple of semi's.  As soon as I wiggled my way out of that predicament,we
headed out in the rain.  I must have gotten some rain in my heatexchangers,
because as soon as I turned on my heating fan, the window turned tosteam.
So it went for half an hour.  I only had to drop down to third oncethrough
the Appalachians.  And.....I passed my first vehicle!
Driving was pretty smooth after that besides the pushing after gassingup.
Illinois was pretty boring, but I got 24 mpg!  Really, I went over the
numbers again and again!
  Upon reaching WI, there were 3-4 hours left until I would be home.  Itwas
late, but we were going to push it and arrive around midnight.  60 miles
left, and it started to drizzle, then freeze.  Not wanting to riskKelly's
life or my own we pulled over.  The two hotels in the area wouldn'tallow
pets, so we camped outside in their parking lot.  Waking up the nextmorning
a lot chilly, I couldn't leave the bus.  We were snowed in.  So crawling
over the front seat and out the window I went to hand-shovel the busout.
This time it wouldn't start even after being pushed and pulled by some
friendly locals.  Now none of the electrical would work.  We called our
parents for rescue.  I checked my fuses and ground and found my groundstrap
to not carry any current.  I ran to the hardware store and replaced the
ground.  She started right up.  We were escorted by Kelly's parents back
home through the slush.  Back home I insulated my heater pipe, replacedthe
carb., attached the idle cut-off switch wire, and rewired the frontparking
lights after the dash went up in smoke.  The most memorable vision ofthe
bus is on the middle of a lake in northern WI ice-fishing.  Two trucksgot
stuck with us that day, but Poopy plowed through without a problem.Driving
to my sister's place down by Milwaukee, the  rear heater heat exchanger
developed a leak, and luckily I held out until her house to pass out.  I
isolated that heat exchanger again.LAG II
     This part of the trip was more laid back.  Mostly flat, easydriving.
The badlands were awesome-looking.  We stopped early one night in orderto
see them the next morning, and I'm glad we did.  We found avery-tempting 74
hi-roof camper for sale in Montana, but it just wasn't the time or the
place.  Half-way through Montana we stopped at a rest stop, and Inoticed
wetness around the right rear rim.  I knew the brake cylinder was leaky,but
brake fluid level barely changed.  Upon further inspection, it was
determined than the fluid was from the reduction gear.  Nothing I coulddo
at that point, so we chugged our way to Spokane, WA where Kelly had some
relatives.  We stayed there for a couple days while I received somespeedy
help from the type 2 listees.  With that problem temporarily solved, wehad
no problem the rest of the way.  Oh yeah, Daisy puked on my militaryuniform
jacket in Minnesota.
     That was the jist of our trip.  Hope to have more.  I believeeveryone
should experience it at least once.  Happy driving--Chet
