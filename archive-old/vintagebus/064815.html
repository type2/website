Don't you just static time an 009 at 7.5 degrees BTDC?

&gt;Eric have you plugged the hole in the throttle plate of the 34 pict 3?  Very
&gt;hard to time with a 009 distributor without doing this.  Go to:
&gt;www.bostonengine_dot_com
&gt;then click on articles and then &quot;009 hesitation blues&quot;.  Good luck.

&gt;Any advice on my gummy 34pict3?  I was told the screw on the side below the 
&gt;choke cover can be blowed out w/ compressed air.  This carb has never liked 
&gt;to idle!  If that screw hole is clogged will that make the bus jump?  I 
&gt;don't want to rebuild the carb as of yet.  Can I soak it w/o damaging the 
&gt;seals?  I'm tried carb cleaner in a can, no fix!  Any carb ideas are grately
&gt;
&gt;appreciated, as is any other spark/fuel trouble shoots.  I know if the gen 
&gt;ground on the shroud comes off it runs similar.  Could I have a grounded out
&gt;
&gt;wire causing all this?  Voltage regulator?  Been driving like this for 500 
&gt;miles w/ lights sometimes and the battery is golden!
