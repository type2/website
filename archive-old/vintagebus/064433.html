No mention of the trials and tribulations
of fitting and reassembling the internals.

Crank is DPR, not DPS, 74mm, not 73mm
main and rod journal measurements vary by.03mm ( .0011&quot;)
cam lift is measured at .050, not duration.
cam lobe clearance is the space left with cam lobe at full lift
You measured to base circle. Subtract the lift.

The specs are not particularly disturbing.
( DPR cranks are better than you measured :)

Let's forget the borescope and have it medically X-RAID !
The noise sounds pretty fishy to me.
Let's take it apart ( just for the halibut :)
Internal exam should resolve any clearance issue,
and expose the gremlin.
For cheap, drain the oil and search the dregs
( with an aluminum magnet :) or send it out
to be analyzed ( by the oil brand supplier ).
Check your FLAPS for this inexpensive service.

&gt;
&gt; so ther it stands; 6 months and 2K later. i lost my job friday, so 
&gt; i'm at a bit of a stopping point as far as 'buy chromoly pushrods and 
&gt; empi rockers and see what happens' .
&gt; 
&gt; i really do want to find a borescope and look inside to rule out 
&gt; internal interferences and piston clearance problems BEFORE i tear it 
&gt; down, but if i have to i'll tear it down to look.
&gt; i'm convinced it is valvetrain related tho, so any extra avenues of 
&gt; exploration are welcomed.
