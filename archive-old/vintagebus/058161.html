 &gt;Better put some HUGE washers, or better yet a large heavy piece of metal

 &gt;bolt, or those shoulder harnesses and belts are worthless.

when I installed seat belts in the 61, I used pieces of torsion bars under 
the sheet metal to spread the load in case of accident.   They are spring 
steel, flex somewhat, and really hard to cut and drill, think they are the 
ticket.
