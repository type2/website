Subject: horn
Mime-Version: 1.0

Working on my horn, which died a few weeks ago. I read the Bentley, and Muir Manuals. Basically it there are two wires going to the horn, one live, one ground.  I touch the live to the body and get a spark. The ground is, well, grounded.  I scrubbed all the contacts with a wire brush. Still nothing.  According to Bentley, you can adjust the contact on the horn, to adjust the HONK.  I thought maybe, it has just loosened up, therefore no HONK. I took the horn off,  started fooling with the contact screw, located on the bottom.  Then I figured, with the contact adjusted properly the resistance between the two cire connections should be zero, or close to it. So I hooked up my ohmeter(I think thats what you call it while checking ohms), adjusted the screw until the resistance dropped from one to near zero. Hooked the sucker back up, and HONK. It worked, but just one short noise, then nothing. I checked the resistance again between the leads, and it was back to one, and no amount of adjusting could get it any lower. 

What I am trying to figure out is:
Does this mean the horn is dead, 
if so did I ruin the horn, (did I do my diagnosis, and work properly)
Can the horn be fixed, I can't see a way to take it apart?

I think the easiest thing is to get a new horn, anyone have advice on where to get a horn(or are they all the same).

Thanks
