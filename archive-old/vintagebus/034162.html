I sell some pretty decent repops for 15 dollars a piece or list special 2
for 25.00, 
I also have some WCM repops here but I found NOS ones at Pomona for less
money then there's, if I could only find were they buy them from.
ps, the WCM do say Hella on them though.

hel all,
my bus has some pretty beat turn covers and ive been thinking about what to 
do... leave em, find good one$, or get some repops. i got the new VW Trends 
yesterday and on page 13 see some repops from WCM which dont look too bad in

the 1/4&quot; black and white picture. anyone have 'em. im worried about the 
shiny part just rubbing off in a week or so.
thanks,
