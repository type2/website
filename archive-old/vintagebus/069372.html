That's for sure! Heck, you can hardly see them on a foggy morning, and I bet
the driver has as much difficulty!

Hooray !  I can't stand those fake &quot;blue&quot; bulbs either.  I see them all the
time on the small import cars, but only for a second - them I am momentarily
blinded.   On the other hand, they do go well with most spoilers and anodized
windshield wiper arm covers.

&quot;blue&quot; bulbs from your Bus. Now. At best they aren't any better than
regular bulbs and at worst they are dangerous.
