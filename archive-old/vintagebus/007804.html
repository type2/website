Subject: Found! AN-8 90 degree elbow.

Before I left for the RMMW/Bandimere weekend, I had looked at 2 big time
tractor places in town and neither place had the 90 degree elbow I needed.
The only other person I found this weekend in Colorado that even knew what I
needed was Clyde Berg and he didn't have one.

Fast forward to today.  I've been carrying this elbow in my pocket for 5
days solid trying to find someone with the correct fitting.  Wire ties, ear
plugs, lint, and other assorted pocket goodies passed through the confines
of the AN-8 90 degree fitting while riding around in my overalls pocket.  A
delivery at work needed to be delivered to Alexandria, NE which is straight
West of here in lands I've rarely covered.  These are small towns with
populations under 500 people in which half the town's filling station pumps
are farm diesel and there is only one gas station with 2 gas pumps one one
island.  No full service either.  I decided to try my luck looking for this
fitting in the tiny farm stores located along the way.

The first town of Plymouth, NE is graced with Well's Implement.  The closest
thing the guy could find was an AN-8 &quot;T&quot; fitting which I politely declined.
Just one more place for oil to leak by if I tried to plug off one end.  It
would be a kludge at best.  He rambled on while looking for the fitting
about why they complicate things by making elbows when they could just get
away with running more rubber line.  Of course he was coming from the
farmer's perspective where hydraulics and old seeping rubber lines are the
norm.

On to Daykin, NE.

I drove around one of the 7 or 8 blocks in town.  I noticed that most of the
old store front buildings stand from over 100 years ago.  Some are
renovated, others original, but all in all they were intact and in pretty
good shape.  Then I spied a little tin buidling that simply read, &quot;Daykin
Hardware.&quot;  I walked in and nobody was in the store at all.  I saw a sign
that read, &quot;Gone to Bank.&quot;  Great - I had the store to myself.  I walked
around and looked in old drawers and found fittings that were close to what
I needed but they either had the wrong ends or were the wrong size.  There
were some old boxes from the 50's or 60's with allen screws in them.  As I
looked out the store front just then, there was a big tractor towing a big
finned 56 Pontiac down the street - totally rust free and complete but
dirty.  With the heat being around 100 today, the mirage effect kicked in
and I visualized a dove blue double cab being towed down the street.  (You
never know - it could happen!)  Sheila Bartles, the proprietor of the store,
walked in with a smile and I introduced myself and my dilemma.  She thought
a minute and with idle chat continuing, took me to the back part of the
store where the &quot;employees only&quot; section was.  There before me lay a huge
assortment of brass fittings - some collecting dust - in a shallow,
home-made wooden box with little square compartments.  I didn't see anything
in my quick scan but she persisted and there in the corner on my side of the
box lay 4 AN-8 90 degree fittings.  I was delighted and bought all 4 of them
just to have for spares because I'm sure I'll need them someday.  Sheila was
thrilled when I told her that not even my trip to Colorado netted the parts
I needed so this little hardware store in Daykin, NE helped me further my
bus project.  I thought it was a rather neat story!
Immediately after I hit the highway, 2 songs I had been singing to myself
were played back to back on the radio so the karma was really flowing - I
knew things were going my way...

The rest of the trip took me to Alexandria, NE where I delivered trusses to
a fella working on his house.  I asked him if he's seen any VWs around he
told me of several that I already know of.  He did tell me of an obscure
junkyard in NorthWestern Nebraska that's &quot;just gotta have 150 to 200 beetles
and some Karmann Ghia's in it.&quot; He shocked me with his knowing Ghia's ever
existed.  I told him so and he said, &quot;Oh yeah &lt;pause&gt; I know my cars.&quot;

On the way home on some obscure yet well maintained gravel roads, I came
over a hill to see a deer (doe) staning in the middle of the road.  She kind
of looked at me and aimlessly trodded off amidst the cornstalks.  As I got
closer to home, an old buddy working with the country roads department was
on some obscure asphalt road putting up passing and no passing signs in
preparation for some upcoming road work.  I slowed down and was &quot;flagged&quot;
off to the side of the road because he recognized me before I recognized
him.  We slung the breeze a minute and then I went back to the lumber yard.
After arranging some more deliveries, I came home for lunch (about 4:00
p.m. - busy day), and wrote this post.  I have 15 minutes left to eat. :-)

Hope you enjoyed another story from the midwest.
