Standard is that running lights are one filament, brake/turn are the
other.

If you're really wanting to rip it all out and start over, I would
recommend you go with the (apparently stock) conversion kit that my
Euro-converted-to-US bus has.  Below is what I posted about it a few
weeks ago.

Bingo.  I didn't write down exactly which wire was which at the back,
but I did label them (they were re-routed front and back, with
different colours spliced in in the front, so which wire's which is
kind of irrelevant in the general case; the labelling for my specific
case is necessary for future maintenance, of course).

I should expand on that parenthetical a bit - the relay box is spliced
into the original wiring using gray, black, and yellow wires.  There
are nine distinct connections to it (ten if you count the bracket
ground).  This makes for a bit of confusion (mind if we call you Bruce
to keep it clear?), but fortunately, most of the wires terminate
nearby in plain view.

Yes.  No.  Yes.  Here's how it works.  First, a diagram of the relay
board (some minor liberties taken to allow for the limitations of
ASCII art):

                                -

The vertical wiggly bits are the coils of the relays.  The long
horizontal bars above them are the moving parts of the relays, which
are normally up.  The flasher relay connects where shown, and the
other side of it goes straight to the fuse box.  Similarly for the
brake light switch.

What we have here is a pair of relays performing exactly the same
work as the US-spec turn signal switch - the two rear filaments are
joined together when nothing's turned on.  If the brake pedal is then
pressed, power is applied to both of them, because the relay arms are
up, and thus providing a circuit from B+ to the switch to the upper
relay contacts to the armatures to the rear bulbs.

If the turn switch is activated, the corresponding relay closes.
Contact between the armature and the upper contactor is broken, so
there's no longer a connection on that side to the brake switch.
Contact is made between the armature and the lower contactor, which is
powered by the flasher relay.  Thus, we have a circuit from B+ to the
flasher to the lower contactor to the armature to the selected rear
bulb.

If, with the turn signal switch activated, the brake pedal is also
pressed, the rear light that is not involved in indicating a turn
comes on solid, because its relay is still deactivated.

It's all quite simple and straight-forward, once you figure it out.
Only took me three or four hours (including the &quot;why isn't it working
now&quot; tail-chasing).

The problem I was having (left turn indicated correctly, right turn
flashed both rear bulbs) was caused by old insulation inside the relay
box having disintegrated (some of the wires cross each other, which
I've not shown above).  Fixing that, and then re-seating all the wires
in their screw terminals correctly (so they didn't short against the
metal cover for the relay box) made everything quite happy again.

Nothing had to be done with grounds in the back; as I'd stated
earlier, those were fine due to cleanup work I'd done the previous
weekend.

The really good news is that with this setup, I can have my semaphores
and my flashing signals, all controlled by the original column-mounted
switch.  I'm quite happy about this.
