OK we did die at the side of the road outside of Las Vegas when the little (ours
was &quot;plastic&quot;) rider broke off (the old one looked new).  We did have a spare but
it was some time to determine the cause and fine the replacement pack-a-way

P &amp; C
59 DDr w/t w 65 ez camper. more spares the better

&gt; Ok, is the little fiber rider on the points worn out?  Can you adjust
&gt; them to any place where they will open and close?  It could be that
&gt; they're way too right or way too loose.  How about the cam on the
&gt; distributor?  For that matter, does the distributor turn evenly?  Does
&gt; it wobble?
