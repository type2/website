Walt,

Yes, a cot is part of the standard equipment for a Westy SO-42.  They are the
same in function but different in materials and shape of the ends.  The split
cot will have black hollow poles with rounded crimped ends.  One will be shorter
than the other.  The canvas will be olive green.

The later ones will have black poles also, but the ends are pre formed and
welded onto the ends of the tubes.  The lengths are different also, but you can
cut them and re weld them to the correct length if you need to .  The canvas for
the bay windows are tan.

One more thing.  On a split the cot and poles are stowed above the large side
cabinet.  They are about a foot longer than the cabinet.  Westfalia made a
&quot;sock&quot; out of the green canvas material and it will be stapled to the top of the
side cabinet.  To stow the cot and canvas, wrap the canvas around the poles and
place on top of the cabinet.  The sock is split down one side and has a snap.
The part of the cot that sticks past the end of the cabinet is placed in the
sock and snapped closed.  This keeps the cot from rocketing forward during
emergency stops.
