I used the sound deadening panels in my 64,and they make a huge difference!
I purchased mine from JC Whitney when they had a sale,otherwise they are
expensive.
However you only need a small piece (10''x10'')to deaden the &quot;tinie&quot; sound
of a door.The stuff JC W. sells is self-adhesive !
    I used these sound deadening panels in all my doors and on the roof.
Then I found the factory styrafoam pieces in a standard microbus a friend
had for the side panels.Then add 1 Westy interior and you have one quiet
bus.(Except owner of said bus likes loud music.)

      IMHO,  If I were to use roofing tar, I think I would only use it on
the bottom inch or two of a panel or door.and I would not slather it on.
