&gt;
&gt;I have a 1960 Standard that came in on the gray market.  This means,
&gt;among other things, that it originally had the Euro-spec electrical
&gt;system (i.e., semaphores), and the dealer converted it to meet US
&gt;requirements (i.e., blinkers).  [contacts cleaned]  On the
&gt;good side, I now have much brighter rear lights.  On the bad side, my
&gt;blinkers are really confused.  Everything works as it should for a
&gt;left turn indication.  For a right turn, however, I get both right-
&gt;side blinkers and the left rear blinker as well.

Make sure you have good grounds at both rear lights.  When I first
got my US-spec '64, there were problems at the right rear light.
The front lights were fine left and right; left rear blinker was OK
but when signaling a right turn the license plate light and the left
blinker would flash.  Fixing the ground at the right rear fixed this.

&gt;One oddness I found was that there are two black w/red wires at the
&gt;right rear.  Originally, it looked like one went to the turn/brake
&gt;filament, and the other was joined with the running light filament
&gt;wires.  All of the wires were badly frayed, so I clipped them off,
&gt;stripped off new sections, and (I thought) put everything back where
&gt;it came from.  That's when problems started. 

From the wiring diagram at vintagebus_dot_com, it looks like your Bus,
in its original Euro configuration, should have had three wires for
lighting going to the rear of the Bus: left tail (white/black), right
tail and license (white/red), and stop (black/red).  There should
be two black/red wires at the right rear (one is the stop from the
front of the Bus and the other goes to the left side) and two
white/red wires (one is the running light from the front of the Bus
and the other goes to the license plate light).

The US-spec has the same tail-light wiring, but two stop/turn
wires.  The right one is black/red and the left one is black/yellow.
In other words there are four wires going to the back for lighting.

Unless you can find evidence of another wire (not in the factory
harness) running from the right rear to the front of the Bus,
I bet one of the things the dealer did was to put all three
tail-light filaments (left, right, and license) on one tail-light
wire, and use the &quot;liberated&quot; tail-light wire for the stop/turn
function on the other side.  One way to do this would be to
cut the white/black wire at the right side and disconnect the
black/red wire that goes from right to left.  Then, splice the
black/red wire to the white/black wire coming from the front
of the Bus, and splice the white/black wire going to the left
tail-light to the white/red wire going to the right tail-light.
He'd have to make some changes up front, too, but that's what
I'd do if I was in a hurry and didn't want to string another wire.

&gt;At the front of the bus, I found what looks to be a dealer-installed
&gt;pair of relays, which appear to be some sort of officially-approved
&gt;conversion kit for achieving US-spec lighting while still using the
&gt;Euro-spec turn signal switch.  The switch powers one of the two
&gt;relays.  That relay, in turn, operates the lights on its side of the
&gt;bus - there's a terminal for each light (just like on the US turn
&gt;signal switch), and inputs for the turn and brake switches.

Do the relays also have a ground wire each?  Do the relays click
when the turn signals are on, or is there a separate flasher?
If there's a separate flasher I'm not quite sure how it would
work.  But if there isn't, and the relays have a ground wire
(or possibly ground through a metal mounting bracket), I think
I know how it would work.

The turn signal wire on the relay goes (inside the relay) to
a flasher and the coil of the relay.  The other end of the
coil is grounded.  The output of the flasher goes to the
front turn signal wire, as the front signal should always
flash no matter what.  The moving contact of the relay goes
to the rear stop/turn wire.  The fixed contact that is
connected to the moving one with the coil OFF is connected
to the brake light wire, and the other fixed contact is
connected to the output of the flasher.

With the turn signals off, the rear stop/turn wire is
connected to the brake light wire, so the bright filament
comes on with the brakes.  With the turn signals on,
the rear stop/turn wire is disconnected from the brake
light wire and connected to the output of the flasher,
so the light on that side blinks.

&gt;So, given that the wires I've got at the front are black and yellow, 
&gt;and the wires I've got at the back are black w/red (all three of them),
&gt;I'm having trouble figuring out how it's supposed to work.

I think the key is going to be figuring out what the wires from
the *front* do, no matter where they should go in the back.
In other words, disconnect all the wires at the tail-lights
from the lights and from any splices to one another.  At
this point you should probably have three wires coming from
the front of the bus, and you can use a test light to sort
them out into park, left stop/turn, and right stop/turn.  If
the turn signals refuse to flash with the rear lights disconnected,
cheat and use one of the bright filaments from the tail-light
bulb as your test light...this should load the flasher enough
to get it to work.  After you figure out what the wires from
the front do, it should be easy to figure out where they should
connect to the lights.  In other words, sort the wires by
function, not by color code.

&gt;Has anyone dealt with one of these conversions before, such that they
&gt;can tell me what the changes are relative to the diagram at Thom's web
&gt;site?

I have not dealt with this specific conversion before, so take
all this with an appropriate sized piece of salt.  I'm just going
by what seems most likely to be happening.

Good luck!
