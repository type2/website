Subject: Re: Bus Awning For sale - $70 

John, et. al.,

I bought the Bus Depot awning last year and used it for the first time 
a couple of weeks ago.

Like many similar items of this ilk (i.e., Made in China), the quality 
is lacking.

I like the shock-corded fiberglass poles that stretch the awning tight, 
but I HATE the metal poles (using springs in place of shock cords).  
They're HEAVY.

The fit and finish was poor.  I had to cut about 2 cm from the length 
of the outside poles (that run along the outer edge of the awning) in 
order to make everything fit together, but I still managed to pull a 
seam or two trying to assemble everything right out of the box.

When I received it, it had obviously been returned by another customer 
(in fact the order sheet with his name on it was still in the box).

I am satisfied with it now, but I'm afraid that this is just another 
example of outsourcing to China.

I remember a time when all the crap from Japan was just that, but after 
a few decades the quality improved.  Perhaps we will see the same thing 
again in another few decades.

I think it is prolly worth $70, but don't force anything trying to put 
it together.

See you at EveryBus!
