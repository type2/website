Subject: Re: [VB] Snap ring pliers

I've bought a lot of tools at pawn shops.   There is nothing wrong with 
having a couple dozen screwdrovers of various shapes and sizes, and some for 
pounding/prying/scaping.  I'd like to have more 10mm and 13mm wrenches.   And 
sometimes you can get them for $0.25..   Actually, there are some no name 
wrenches I like, just because of the shape .  A slight difference in 
thickness around the nut hole and height can make it a lot easier or 
impossible to tighten that awkward 10mm SP intake nut.  Or reach that forward 
13mm that hold the carb to the intake.   Craftman don't excell there.


But even though the better tools cost more, they are really nice.  Snap on 
ratchets are so much  nicer to use.  The way they click.   yum

&lt;&lt; Curt, and others,
 
 I'm gonna say this and it don't matter how poor you are: when you buy a
 tool, you go for the best that you can afford, and Sears Craftsman is near
 the top and guaranteed for life. The best you can afford means that you
 buy the Craftsman tool, not the Harbor Freight junk. If you have a lot of
 money, you buy Craftsman or you go up to Proto or SnapOn, or Allen, etc.
