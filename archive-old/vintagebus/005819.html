The proper way Boyd is to turn the torsion springs - not an easy job but
definitely doable.  It took me a week at about 3 to 4 hours a night to get
my bug set up correctly.  It was a PITA but it sits level and rides nice.
If your bus has that nose-in-the-air stance, it'd be worth turning them but
if it sits level, I'd actually leave it alone.
