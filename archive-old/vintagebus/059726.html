Subject: RE: [VB] safari window install

You really should find a way to install a set of MetWiz's safari plates.  I
think this is the ONLY way to go using machine thread screws instead of
sheet metal screws.  Sure you'll have to put a hole and weld it back up but
the outcome is soooo much better.

Good luck with all the people telling you that they will leak ;-)

3DPete asked:
I'm having a set of OG safari windows cleaned up and
painted by reVOLKS_dot_com. I was wondering if anyone
could give us an idea of what we'll be up against when
we go to install? How much time should this take? Any
answers, tips, or intstruction would be greatly
appreciated.
