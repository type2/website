     Got to the shop on Sat. morning to load the bus for the trip and like
always, phone ringing off the hook, e-mails and people who just have to walk
in when I'm trying to leave. After 6 hours I finally got my usual swap stuff
packed and said the heck with the used junk, decided I better change the oil
since, like Everett I haven't changed it since the Classic and was preparing
for a journey across the desert, leaving in 116 degrees. While loading the
bus I found my 12 volt electric fan, put it up front so now I had duel air
action. Tied down all the crap on the roof rack, middle seat for Everett, BD
nose clip, also for Everett, canopy, tables and who knows what else. Checked
the air in the tires or did I, added the oil, 40 weight Vavoline racing and
off I went.
  Nothing better then driving a bus in 116 plus heat, overheat, ya right.
Stopped for gas after 45 or so miles, went back to make sure the oil wasn't
leaking out, spit on the engine, sizzle, perfect, should be what I expected,
now, most people would panic, MY ENGINE IS TO HOT, not me. Fueled up and out
I went across the desert, no flickering light at stops, so no worries,
continued past the shoe tree (this is a tree in the middle of nowhere full
of shoes, saw a new tree started with bras and underwear, all in a blur
being I was cruising at 70 MPH. Got to the 10 freeway to head out west young
man and had an uneventful climb up Chirco Summit when on the way down all
H_at_LL broke loose, must have been 40 plus mile an hour winds, this cut my
cursing speed down to 50 mph and had to stay in 3rd gear till I got to
civilization where all I had to deal with were inconsiderate drivers in
there SUV's. Arrived at Pomona just around dark, stopped at my favorite TACO
stand before entering THE POMONA, proceeded to my spot an ate. 
   The best part of Pomona is the socializing and looking at all the way
overpriced NOS parts and laughing about it. Everett showed and we squeezed
him in bus row with THE GANG, made him feel special&lt;:?).
   Did my Pomona thing Sunday, another buyers market, saw a set of Safaris
complete sell for $175.00 and that was about it, didn't have time to cruise
as I was in my spot alone, bo ho ho.
   Left Pomona and started to head home with a drive by of Rich Yost (aka
RUSTY BUSES) to pick up a back seat and a couple cargo doors for the JEROME
RAFFLE BUS, looked at all his buses, including his newly acquired 58? 23
window Deluxe and the other 20 or more splits then hit the road again with a
quick stop at Costco, made it home by 8pm, got to love the tailwinds,
cruised between 75 and 80 coming home, no engine heat problems, on my fuel
stops I could grab the dipstick so must be running OK.
  Anyway I'm here and glad to tell this little story.

Ronnie
