i agree, why help people when you can give that hard earned money to needy
cats that will go make a million more needy homeless cats?  it just wouldnt
make any sense.

&gt; Just got home from my day in the salt mines, knocked out a couple more
hours
&gt; on the raffle bus and then came in to read the list. Probably shouldn't
&gt; comment since I am but a lowly grunt, and not an exalted board person, but
&gt; I'm all bloated and bitchy so I will anyway. I know that everyone means to
&gt; help and that is great, but the vintagebus list is a completely
&gt; innapropriate place to decide what will be done with the proceeds from the
&gt; Jerome Jamboree. While there is no doubt that there are victims in serious
&gt; need on the East Coast, we have needy people local to us that will still
be
&gt; in need after the new World Trade Center is standing with the bronzed
&gt; scrotums of the guilty terrorists mounted prominantly in a large spitoon
in
&gt; the lobby.
&gt;
&gt; The club always gives to worthy charities, and ones where the effects of
the
&gt; donation can be verified. This years choices are equally valid. There are
&gt; not unlimited funds to give, if they are given to the New York victims,
they
&gt; are taken from the Hacienda de Los Angeles (which benefits survivors of
&gt; childhood near drownings) or the Animal Benefits Club (a no-kill shelter
&gt; that does amazing work completely through donations and has great
initials).
&gt; Easy enough to do in an internet discussion, but much harder to do in
&gt; person. While it would be very popular to give every dime to the &quot;concept&quot;
&gt; of helping the victims in New York, it would be a neat trick to figure out
&gt; how to actually do that. Just mailing a check is not necessarily helping.
&gt;
&gt; We all like helping severely injured or abandoned kids and animals, and
with
&gt; the charities selected we are sure we are doing just that. The negative
&gt; effect of removing our donation from them would surely be greater than any
&gt; possible positive effect of a few thousand dollars to the Red Cross. By
all
&gt; means help your fellow citizens in the East. Give blood. Send money.
Develop
&gt; an interesting fundraiser for them at Jerome and I will help you pull it
&gt; off, but you can't push aside the valid and worthwhile needs of the
&gt; charities already selected just because they didn't come into the national
&gt; consciousness in the last 24 hours. The board may or may not vote to help
&gt; back East, but you just shouldn't expect to show up at Jerome and see
&gt; everything going to the Red Cross just because you saw a couple of posts
&gt; about it on the internet. Jerome will be fun, the bus is nice, and the
&gt; charities are great. Hope to see you there!
