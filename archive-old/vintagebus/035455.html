&lt;&lt; Anyone have any suggestions on what material to use underneath the gas 
tank straps on the 4 top corners? &gt;&gt;

Hi Robert,
The same material was used under the tank against the body and does look like 
some type of horse hair stuff.  Unfortunitly when used under the tank these 
pads often hold moisture agains the tank.  Which has rusted badly and even 
thru tanks we have.  One tank that was rusted through from the outside like 
this was so rust free on the inside that the steel manufacture ink stamped 
logo was still visible when we cut the tank apart!  Due to this finding we 
now use folded strips of roofing tar paper under the tank.
