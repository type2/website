&lt;&lt; Has anyone tried machining a SINGLE PORT head for 9mm exhaust guides and 
valves??  New custom order ex. valves with 32mm heads and 9mm stems are 
available from TRW---I've already checked.  This combination would seem to be 
the &quot;ideal&quot; setup for a bulletproof bus head.  &gt;&gt;
Hi Gene,
This is what we mentioned just a couple of days ago that our friends in San 
Diego at Bear's VW Machine sell.  We are running a pair right now on our 
1641SP engine in our 1960 panel for the last 45,000+ miles.  Eric&amp;Barb
