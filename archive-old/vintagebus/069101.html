&gt; RGB BEARINGS 1: Took a closer look at the RGBs.  As mentioned, passenger
&gt; side upper bearings are toast.  Driver side uppers look OK, as do the
&gt; outer lowers (the $$ ones).  I rotated the stub axles to see what I could
&gt; tell about the inner lowers.  Slight rumbling that may be normal.  Hard to
&gt; tell.  End of the stub shaft will wiggle back and forth about a mm or two. 

That rumbling sound is normal for a bearing that needs to be replaced.

&gt; 
&gt; RGB BEARINGS 2: I am daunted by the process for rebuilding these even
&gt; after (or maybe because of) reading Bentley and Dave Easterwood's article. 
&gt; Especially that cover plate on the back.  And I see I will have to
&gt; disassemble at least the passenger-side one to get the bad upper inner
&gt; bearing out. Bentley says use a *new* nut on the inner end of stub axle
&gt; when replacing?  Who gots dem?

I reuse the big nut. I don't stake the edge into the notch when I put it 
back either, I use locktight. The upper inner bearing is no problem. 
Just pull the tube off the axle with the bearing in it, then knock the 
bearing out by hitting it from the inside with a long stick, like a 
broom handle. The big plug won't be a problem for you either. You have a 
welder, so you can do all the tricks like welding a nut to the plug to 
use with a slide hammer, or repairing any damage you might do to it 
while removing it.


&gt; All kinda wackos come out of the woodwork.... ;-)

Hey! I resemble that remark!
