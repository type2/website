I can finally write about this.

I met him 3 years ago at High Country Bus Fest.  He was in the company =
of 2 very lovely ladies but he caught my eye even more than they did.  I =
remember thinking 'Wow - he's beautiful'.  I tried to get to know him =
but he remained aloof, preferring the company of others.  I met him at =
several other campouts, always with the same 2 pretty ladies.  He seemed =
wary of me for some reason, why I didn't know.

About a year ago I went to pick up a bus from one of the aforementioned =
pretty ladies and there he was again.  I left busless, but he came home =
with me.  He seemed uneasy during the ride, moving around and looking =
out the window.

We got to know each other slowly, as most good relationships start.  He =
stayed at the farm while I commuted back and forth from Charleston and =
work to my little postage stamp farm in Lenoir, NC.  Every Friday when I =
walked in the door there he was to greet me, always happy that I was =
home and never mind what kind of week he may have had.

If nothing else in the whole wide world, he liked to ride in the buses.  =
I'd ask if he wanted to go with me and he'd be at the bus before I was.  =
He tolerated the baywindow camper, but his true love (besides me) was =
the splittie.  He'd sit tall and proud, and I know other people would =
look at him riding in the bus with me and they'd marvel too.

Many of you east coast bussers may have seen him either with Andrea and =
Chris, or with my family and I.

You see, Rocky was much more than a dog, he was a great bus person and a =
great friend.  I have other dogs, but it just isn't the same.  I know =
there are other bus dogs out there and have had the honor of meeting =
many of them.

Driving the bus just isn't the same without him.

&quot;I read somewhere that 77 per cent of all the
mentally ill live in poverty. Actually, I'm more intrigued
by the 23 per cent who are apparently doing quite well
for themselves.&quot;
