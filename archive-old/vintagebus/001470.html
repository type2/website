It's back! I had it sold to someone in WV, But he never sent the money. I
was even going to let him make it in instalments.Anyway I had to have the
room in my shop so it's outside again. BTW Thanks Thom for this wonderful
website and this list where us on the east coast can enjoy reading about the
west coast VW seen,without the onesidedness of the mags. Hereis the ebay
link.
