Subject: Re: [VB] AL crapcase update

&gt;Ah, a GEX button.  They stick one on every &quot;rebuilt&quot; engine they sell.  I
&gt;suppose on the theory is that they can get rid of some comebacks by
&gt;claiming the customer overheated the engine.

yup - but BAP told me that they've been doing more 'all-new' motors 
than reused part motors, and in most cases they'd rather the customer 
send the motor back and get it fixed than hassle about it.

note that this was a conversation, NOT a policy discussion, so YMMV  :)
