Hi George,
You disappoint us!  The way to go would be with a nice type four 2000cc 
engine for reliabilty and around town.  Then find or build a V2 rocket engine 
to mount in the rear upper hatch for acceleration unsurpassed.  If you are 
really good you will make sure to gimble the engine properly so as to change 
from straight back to 30 or even 45 degrees upward to help keep the bus on 
the pavement at speeds from 100-600+ MPH!   Eric&amp;Barb
