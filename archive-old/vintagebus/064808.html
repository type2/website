If you use armorall, be prpared to keep applying it regularly for the life
of the part to which you apply it.  Armorall leaches the plasticizers from
the rubber or plastic, replacing them with its own more volatile ones
which has the appearance of &quot;rejuvinating&quot; the material.  If you don't
keep replacing the plasticizers as they evaporate, the rubber will soon
crack.
