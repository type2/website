Subject: putting on AIRS

Gosh, for a bunch of old hippies you guys sure are SENSITIVE!
Just try to grok me and send some love my way, man....


For the record - as Rex says, I would be tire-ironed in most small towns
due to my looks (long hair, dog, vw bus).
There is a Deadhead teen (well, prolly twenties now) who apparently STILL
tells people about the dude in the bus who stopped and drove him 30 miles
there and back to get a flat repaired while he was trying to get to a
Rainbow gathering in Colorado. The dude in the bus was me, and I still stop
for every VW broken down I see.

My comment was SARCASM, kids... I'd type in the OED definition for ya, but
I have a hangover and typing hurts my teeth............
