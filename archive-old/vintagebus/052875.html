I gotta throw in that I don't smile when the tax man comes a calling, rather
I want Uncle Sam the heck out of my pocket book.  Frankly I can't see why I
should pay higher taxes  ( Yes, you're fooling yourself if you think you can
increase the size of the fed govt w/o them raising your taxes ) to destroy
the objects of my hobby, and much less the livelihood of people that restore
these classic vehicles and keep them running for a living.  The govt is
taking potential business away from them.

&gt;I just did a quick read of this bill  # S.1766, and it seems that it only
&gt;applys to turning in vehicles that are registered and operational, not
&gt;salvage yard units.

...
&gt;Any comments?
&gt;
&gt;cal


yuh - folks with a running, RESTORABLE junky bus are gonna say &quot;$400
(typical payout in these bills) towards a camry? SWEET!&quot;
how those (assumed poor) folks intend to come up with the rest of the cash
is never addressed.


it does mean that some clunkers sitting 'out back' will be spiffed up and
tagged just long enough to get the dosh, and scrapped.
not too many.  a far more serious threat are bills - usually local - that
make it a crime to even HAVE a non-tagged, nonoperational vehicle on
property, even out of sight. some communities in texass even have
provisions allowing removal by sheriff w/ little warning to owner.

believe me, if TEXAS passes sh*t like this (where a man can be legally shot
dead for stealing HUBCAPS on yer proppity), y'all likely have similar laws
a brewin.
