Where:  THE RED BARN on Highway 101 in Aromas, California (40 miles south of
San Jose/ 17 miles north of Salinas)

Why:  To have an informal and casual VW bus show along with the swap meet!!!


DETAILS:

---THE SHOW
         BYOB '01 is a 1967 and older VW Transporter ONLY show.  Entry into 
the show is FREE!  All other non '67 and older VW Transporters are welcome 
to come visit, but will be asked to park in the parking lot apart from the 
show.  Spectator entrance is FREE!  Awards will be determined by the 
participants and spectators of the show (See SHOW CATEGORIES below).


---THE SWAP
         Richard Stewart will be hosting the VW swap meet at the Red 
Barn.  Fees for the Swap area are $10 per space.


---THE RAFFLE
         Strictly Vintage 2s has obtained donations from shops all across 
the Nor
Cal Bay Area and secured items from well-known VW supply houses.  The 
raffle will occur at 9:00am and 10:30am, with the final raffle occurring 
just after the awards are given at noon.


---CAMPING

         Camping will be available at the Red Barn Friday Night in the 
parking area on the North side of the Red Barn.  Saturday Camping at the 
Red Barn has yet to be determined.


---SHOW CATEGORIES

         ** SWISS CHEESE **
         This is the award for the VW Transporter with the most holes or 
missing pieces from rust, bullets, or whatever.  It's the closet thing to 
Swiss cheese!

         ** SYMPATHY **
         Give an award to the VW Transporter that emotes the most sympathy 
from you.  Whether it's because of its current condition, or because of 
some tale of woe from its owner!

         ** MOST COVETED **
         Vote for the VW Transporter that you most wished you owned.  It 
doesn't matter whether it's a trailer queen, a diamond in the rough, or a 
rust bucket. YOU want it above all the rest!

         ** BEST ACCESSORY **
         Show your support and admiration for the best accessory to the VW 
Transporter!  It doesn't matter if it's a factory option, special dash 
ornament, body modification, etc....

         ** BEST OF SHOW  **
         Simple... right?  Which Transporter is the best at BYOB!

***PLUS: There are three (3) additional special awards given out.
