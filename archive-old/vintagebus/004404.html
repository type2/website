     After spending a few weeks stewing over the '63 6v single cab and it's 
     various electrical problems (no brake lights, sporadic turn signals, 
     charging light glowing when brakes applied, wires getting hot, bad 
     starting) the light in my head finally went on yesterday, Memorial 
     Day, as I sat in the cab drinking a Memorial beer.  
     
     I remembered reading on this list a post about taking the switches 
     apart and cleaning the contacts, so I did. It wasn't the most fun way 
     to spend my holiday but by the end of the day, everything worked 
     again!  And brightly.  Do this, especially to your 6 volt vehicles.
     
     Ray
