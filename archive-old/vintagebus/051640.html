Subject: Re: [VB] Wiring harness

Go to http://www.vintagebus_dot_com/wiring for contact info for WiringWorks -
talk to Bob and maybe he could set something up for you.

&gt; One thing that has bugged me since I got the Single Cab back in '97 was the
&gt; condition of the wiring harness.  I'd like to replace it this spring and
&gt; would welcome suggestions on where to get a replacement.  I'd like a high
&gt; quality product as I intend to keep her for a while.  One thing of interest
&gt; would be a semi custom harness where a few wires could be added for
&gt; additional components.
