 I also have some difficulty with my cargo door Lock/Latch.  The key locks
 the barrel, but when turning the door handle, the &quot;Outer Sleeve&quot; turns.
 This sort of negates the locked barrel, and opens the door.  I am wondering
 if maybe the door mechanism is the wrong type/year for my panel.  It looks
 like there should be &quot;Stop for that &quot;outer sleeve&quot; to wedge against, to
 prevent it from turning.
 I have taken a look in my Bentley manual, but I don't see this outlined
 anywhere.
  &gt;&gt;

the chromed collar around the handle turns as well?   the collar is used for 
years and years- all splittys? at least post bd   Remove the cargo door 
handle  and collar, and check out to see whether the collar or the door is 
rounded- it should have a shape where the collar will not turn in the door.  
Compare to someone else's split- is it the same collar?
