OK :)
I am running a 30pict-1, 1600 SP, stock aircleaner for a 70.. jets are
122.5 main, 125 emulsion, 50 pilot.
009. The motor will almost die (will if I am not quick w/ the toes) when I
first hit the gas from a stop.
It DIDN'T do this when I had a main jet of 127.5 and a pilot of 55. I
changed the main jet because I was getting 10mpg, and the idle for a
similar reason. So please ignore the itch to post &quot;get rid of the 009 &quot;  -
the only distro I like better is the type 3, so there!


I assume there is an adjustment to be made, but where? I have tweaked the
idle screw a bit, anything else? Float level? Up or down?
Should I go back up to a pilot of 55 and retune the idle screw?
Other than that, the beast runs fine. Just kinda embarrassing at green
lights when you STOP and the guy behind you ain't expecting that....
