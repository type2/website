Subject: More Autopsy stuff

I promised some plastigauge info. and here it is. I just checked a
couple of journals.

I bought the .001&quot; to .003&quot; strip.

Rod bearings: (one checked)
I checked the worst looking rod bearings in the rod they came out of on
the same journal they were running on. The plastigauge was squished out
so wide it was off the scale. The spec is .0008&quot; to .0028&quot; for clearance
in the rod bearing with new bearings, .006&quot; wear limit. The clearance in
that journal was still less than .001&quot;.

Main bearings:
On the mains I checked the #2 main (most worn) with the crank turned so
the most worn position of the journal was on the plastigauge. I got a
good solid .0015&quot; reading. The spec is .001&quot; to .0035&quot; new, .0067&quot; wear
limit.
