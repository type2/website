Dr Joe. Uncle Jerry Jess mentions him from time to time. He manufactures bus
tow bars that fit splits and bubbles, as well as repops of both steel and
aluminum roof racks, I think. Maybe he can help you. Uncle Jerry can prolly
put you in touch at vwstuff_at_uswest_dot_net
Parts Is Parts made an excellent repro of the Westy rack, but have
shamelessly turned all production over to Gnu Beetull racks. I heard they
still sell parts from their inventory and they are supposedly
interchangeable with the original. You can find them with a net search, I
don't care for their attitude and ain't gonna make it that easy.
