Thom, Split List, 

Call me stupid, but I don't understand the question.

&gt;&gt; I am trying to decide whether to send it out when the frame is done, or 
wait
until I get all the new metal welded in.....&lt;&lt;
By &quot;frame is done&quot; I assume you mean before you start putting outer body 
panels on. It is probably easier to get to blast some of the spots without 
the body panels.  Is there a cargo floor in it now?  Blasting now would also 
mean there is less cleanup required at welds.  Blasting later means you can 
get primer on it faster to prevent microrust.  

&gt;&gt;* Areas that are exposed, (ie underside of the front floors) would be
exposed and get a proper blasting and painting.&lt;&lt;&lt;
Wouldn't the cab floor be exposed in either case?  Does this '54 have belly 
pans?  From the &quot;belly pan to third outrigger&quot; thread that was going, I seem 
to remember it does have pans.  Of course, these would definetly get in the 
way for later blasting.

&gt;&gt;* all parts will receive same primer treatment&lt;&lt;
So you mean you will leave the primer that comes on the replacement panels or 
old paint on clips?  I have always wondered about the repo panel primer.  As 
for Alan Schofield's, some of the black primer comes right off easy, and some 
is a real a bear to blast off.  I finally ended up torching some of the 
panels (carfully not to warp them) to get the paint off.  Don't know what to 
do inside the doglegs where I couldn't get the primer off.  I don't trust 
that black primer.

Sorry I'm not much help, Tom Good in Vermont

PS.  Warning NM content:  I saw a eurovan on the street today, and I thought 
&quot;Self, you know, even though I don't like the VW company, just from a visual 
standpoint, the NM is still an improvement over THAT!&quot;   BTW, I also like the 
AMC Pacer, just to let you know where my tastes are.  Oh yeah, also the 
surface rover vehicle from the original &quot;Lost in Space&quot;, with the skylight 
windows!  It was only in a couple episodes.
