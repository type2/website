Hi all,

I saw the post on disk brakes and was wondering if anyone knows about
the 5 lug disk brake kit that Rocky Mountain Motorworks has imported
&gt;from Germany.  It seems to fit just about any application.  It is a
little expensive at a $1,000.  Sure seems like it is a well thought out
kit.  Also seems to include everything needed.  Nice thing about these
is that you can use your existing wide 5 lug wheels.
