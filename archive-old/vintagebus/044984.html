&lt;&lt; 've got a '66 that's gonna be parted out. Can I use a cut-off wheel to cut
 metal sections off the body. I'd like to try &amp; keep just about anything
 that isn't crushed or rusted out. I don't have access to a torch, so that's
 not an option. TIA

Wheelie cutters are just to slow and cost to much after a while.  I've been
using a Saws All the past couple of years now and it is definitely the way to
go.  The nice thing is you can get blades in just about any length, so you can
cut though pillars, frames, pretty much anything in one pass.  It also cuts
very fast!!  I used to be concerned about warpage and the like, but I've found
that with a little practice, there is none.  I also like the Saw All for it's
lack of heat it creates in the metal and the lack of sparks.
   Peace, Love, and don't forget the safety glasses!
