&gt;  &lt;&lt; It says on the web site that they only fit bays but I
&gt;  dont see what is the huge difference between a split
&gt;  and bay as far as mounting a bike rack goes. &gt;&gt;
&gt;  
&gt;  I'm not the expert, but I suspect your are correct.
&gt;  
&gt;  Could there possibly be a difference in the hinges betwwen the years?
&gt;  
&gt;  My only concern would be if the bays can somehow support the weight and 
not 
&gt;  the earlier models.

I believe the 64-67 rear hatch is the same size as bays, or at least early 
bays.   I have seen a bay with a splitty rear hatch, and vice versa.   there 
is of course 64-66 the rear latch deal, and bays do have the rear window 
defogger -at least us spec bays do, but the size and mechabove is the same I 
believe.
