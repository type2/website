&gt; We've been trying to do the same thing down here in
&gt; Vegas for the last month
&gt; or so.  So far, just 4 of us(5 VW's), My '66 Van &amp;
&gt; 69 Baja, a nother '66 , a
&gt; Westie and a 62 single cab.
&gt; We are working on flyers for the club.  &quot;Air Cooled
&gt; of Vegas&quot; is the
&gt; brainchild of Eric Allred, a recient arrival here
&gt; from SLC.  Hopefully it
&gt; will catch on.

Jon,
Fill me in on your progress and whats working down
there in Vegas on getting your new club started. We do
have a couple of good people (Steve Hanson and Jim
Becker) to form the 'core' of the group. I figure that
other groups would be interested in coming to Reno for
a 'run' with an invitation from our group.
Maybe your guys would be interested in a Hot August
nights trip to Reno. I will be showing one or two of
my busses.....
