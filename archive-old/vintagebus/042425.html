well,

I am a big fan of ronnies aluminum repro round mirrors.  I have a set and
they are kewl. (i dunno if you can get em elsewhere, im sure you can..)

anyway, the prices are good... i think it was $18 per mirror $12 per arm,
and like $2 per clamp... so get your money back and spend $64+shipping and
have nifty round mirrors. They even have VW part numbers on em.

The arms have the wrong thread at the bottom (8x1.5 instead of 8x1.0) but
who will notice or care.  Also the arms seem to be stainless instead of
regular steel.

I havent found a source for the lock plates that hold the nut, so im just
using a stainless nylock that i bought for $0.50 or so...

peas,

Steve

p.s. dont forget you need 2 washers as well, one above the hinge and one
below.

p.p.s. im painting my stainless arm to match my body as thats the way it
should be :)  I had a passenger side arm already and its painted or i mite
just leave the arm stainless.
