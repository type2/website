Subject: Re: My late 67 master cylinder

Hello Everyone!

    I have a question about a late (really late they only made nine
hundred more
after mine) 67 deluxe bus with the hard to find master cylinder It has
two brake
sensors on the left side and two brake lines on the right. I need new
bushings
for the reservoir base that push into the cylinder and a rebuild kit or
I need a
whole new master cylinder it bleeds like mad!  Can anyone help with a
company name that might make a rebuild kit or replacement!

                                          Thanks for your Responses!
                                                       Eric Lykens
                                          God speed in my 67 Deluxe!
