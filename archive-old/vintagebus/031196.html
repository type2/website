Subject: 1960 Double Cab--

Finally!! Got to drive my 1960DC This Sunday--The last time was May 6th   one day befor my
right hip replacement==From the hip replacement untill now i owe so much to
Steve--Dave--Ron--another Dave-
J.D.--and Steve Holingsworth for the rebuild and new shims in the 28PICT--But most of all
to Magoo who had to put up with my insane attack to get the DC road worthy-She was
VWonderfull as always--We will be at the next Pomona  --   I have an Extra 1960DC complete
back seat-minus the pedestal for sale at $200 or trade?? we also have pics of the seat--
----I am still looking for DC interior panels--?? If anyone can help--or I will just
detail the ones i have--My DC came  without the rear view mirror--after driving it
today--I think i want one--So a 1960 splittie rear view mirror is also wanted also--If you
want to see the SWR DC--here is my web site--and as i said before M 544  which means the
side gates were SC gates cut down by VW to fit a DC--M181 was chrome hub caps--Peace to
all and Vantastic to be a VW driver again!  !PS:  http://vwstuff.vwspeed_dot_com/
