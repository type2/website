Subject: squealing noise - any ideas?

I finally tracked down a strange noise that I have been hearing in my bus
yesterday.  When I have the clutch pushed in, and the engine is at idle speeds
(Mine still does not idle)  I can hear a very loud squealing / rubbing noise.
When the bus is out of gear, no clutch pressed, no noise.  It does not seem to
matter when I have the clutch pressed in if the trans is in or out of gear.
The engine is a 1600DP - the trans is unknown.  I do know that it is not the
stock transmission.  I believe that it is also from a bug.  Anyone have any
ideas on what this might be?  I am making ready to pull the engine in the next
week or so to figure it out.
