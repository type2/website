Subject: Attn. all shoppers, black plate special on aisle 63

Hey y'all,

This rabble may be of some help to Cali listees.

When I bought my 63EZ in Ariaona, I received the og Cali black plates with the bus.  Checked out the CA DMV website and see that the cut-off year for YOM plates is 1962.  Damnit! 
I head down to the DMV and question them, and they tell me that I need og paperwork stating the plates were og to the bus.  So I went ahead a registered the bus and got the new white plates.

Fast forward to last month , and VanBondo says he found all of the og paperwork for the bus..woo hoo!

So I get it in the mail and head down to the DMV.  They give me a statement of fact form and tell me to make copies of the og registration receipts (proving the plates were orginal to the vehicle), photocopies of the plates and write down on the form that I am requesting the og plates to be re-instated on the bus.

I mailed that all off a few weeks ago, and upon checking the mailbox yesterday, I gots a letter from the DMV.
They gave me my black plates back!  So now I have to go to the DMV and pay my transfer fee and get new stickers.

Now all I've got to do is re-paint the front plate and touch up the og license plate frame. (anyone have a Lee Wood Motors-Whitter CA license plate frame for the front?)

Later,
Beto
