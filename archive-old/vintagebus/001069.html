Has anyone ever heard of replacing the gears in the reduction boxes with gears of equal size (i.e. 1:1 ratio)? This would effectively eliminate the reduction boxes. It's been years since I've had mine apart, so I don't exactly remember what they look like on the inside - perhaps it wouldn't be possible.

Just a thought.

 That was Mike Gensler not Stephen Gutknecht who has the 1776 engine.
 Anyway, he (Mike) didn't say he couldn't get over 67 mph, he just said
 that was what he got at 4K rpm. I still think a bigger engine will let
 you go faster. Sorry for the mixup. Their names *do* both start with G
 though 8^).
  &gt;&gt;
well, a bigger motor will have more power and will probably let you push 
higher rpms (at least for a bit) from the more hp, it will definately make 
the hills easier, and make it easier to go higher gearing.   a 36hp motor in 
a 3.88 bus with 1.26 reductions and loaded to the gills will take a while to 
get up to speed.  That is why there is a general correlation with higher 
gearing and bigger motors.  Cuase you will do the same rpms at same speed and 
vice versa no matter what motor you have, and if you really want to go faster 
with the big motor you may find it helpful to change the gearing (or get 
bigger tires)
