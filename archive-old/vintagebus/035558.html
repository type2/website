I just saw today there is something called Volksfest at Hickory Grove Park 
just north of Peoria on Route 40 (Knoxville Road). I think it's Sunday. I 
hope it's a VW show but in that area of Peoria it might be an excuse for 
Germans to get together and drink beer. Either way, I'm checking it out 
Sunday. Unfortunately my bus will remain in my garage in LeClaire, Ia.
