I'm not sure where people get the idea that the 34 PICT-3 is a POS carb.
I'm also no engine guru, but I find it amusing all the people who advocate
the use of the adpater plate and a little SP carb over properly tuning the
34, but I digress.

Your problem may have to do with the matchup of the dizzy to the carb/engine
setup you've got.  You either have a dual-port strength vacuum can, or a 
single-port vacuum can on your distributor -- and you're doing a dual-port
engine with a single-port carb.  The vacuum signal may not be correct for
whatever dizzy it is that you are using.  Also, you set your timing based on 
the distributor model in there, assuming you are using it on the engine setup
it was designed for.  With your setup you may have to tweak it a little.  
Look for a part number on the distributor, and...there's this site with like
every distributor every made for the old VWs and their specs, but I don't have
the link.  Anybody?

Stepping up the accelerator pump may help, but you may get better results by
resetting the timing properly if it isn't already, or moving the advance up a
hair.  Listen for pinging under load if you do the latter.  You might also
try installing bigger jets, but I've never done that so I'll shut my trap on
that topic.  But you very well may be a little under carbed.

I run a 1600DP w/ 34 PICT-3 and a single-vacuum, dual-advance distributor I 
pulled out of a '74 autostick b*g in a junkyard.  This distributor has a
mechanical advance similar to that in a 009 as well as the responsiveness of
a vacuum-advance distributor.  I've never had much trouble with this setup, and
when I added Pertronix and CDI a la Hoover it just got better :-)  Lots of
power on hills and reliable, it's the ideal setup for a 1600 DP in a split,
IMHO.
