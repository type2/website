Subject: Re: [VB] BMW, Get a hint VWoA

Hmmm.  I've always wanted an Isetta, and an 'O2 would make a
cool retro track car...

&gt;   Last night on speed vision there was a story on BMW motorcycles, not that
&gt; this has anything to do with VW's, but wait, yes it does. Do you know that
&gt; BMW cars and motor cycles FULLY SUPPORT their vintage market and are
&gt; bringing out old dies and molds to remake parts for their VINTAGE
&gt; cars/motorcycles! The goal of BMW is to be able to furnish any part
&gt; necessary to help you restore your BMW, from sheet metal to the most minute
