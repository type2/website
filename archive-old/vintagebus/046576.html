Subject: Re: [VB] Was Timing and overheating question...

Thanks all for the advice/reasurrance on my oil temp. I checked all seals and 
the compartment looks pretty tight. I am using Castrol 30 wt. I adjusted the 
timing to 7.5 BDTC and the thing would barely idle (sort of a loping thing). 
Hmmm could this be a carb out of adjustment instead, or should I just crank 
up the idle speed screw and forget it? My carb is a newly rebuilt (and 
supposedly adjusted by the same guy who forgot to install 2 of the 3 screws 
in the accelerator pump cover) Solex 30/3. 
Hopefully I can get this thing on the road this weekend!

Thanks,

Garrett
