&gt; Today is my official return to the vintage bus
&gt; listserv after severly
&gt; curtailing my posts 3 months ago.  I've been putting
&gt; most of my writing
&gt; efforts towards the Buskatiers list and the
&gt; vintagevw list.  I just want
&gt; everyone to note that Mark Ahlbright (or whatever
&gt; his name was) who leveled
&gt; the accusation against me that I post for
&gt; egotistical purposes has never
&gt; once posted one message to the vintagebus listserve.
&gt;  I suppose he thinks
&gt; that by doing so, I would accuse him of being
&gt; egotistical.
&gt; 
&gt; So I'm back - no big fan fair or nothing.  I'll just
&gt; be posting more than I
&gt; have in the past.  I think I've also grown a little
&gt; bit thicker skin so if
&gt; I'm accused of anything more like this, I'll have
&gt; this absence to reflect on
&gt; for proof that I don't &quot;NEED&quot; to post on this list
&gt; to feed an out-of-control
&gt; ego.  I only post because I love to teach and show
&gt; people things I've
&gt; learned in order to help them save time and enjoy
&gt; working on their VWs.

 Well as a newbie let me say....I enjoy the advice
from all who care to give it.I dont know how many
&quot;new&quot; people are on this list but my guess is I am not
alone.And I find you guys in the know about VW stuff
are talking over my head alot of the times and fights
seem to start over things they should not.Some people
will start things just to start things...Hey...let
them be...let them go elsewhere to fight...I thought
this was for learning and shareing our love of
splitties (to flowery there?) Well anyways my thought
was that we are a bit different breed than the rest of
the auto world that like to shoot at one another.When
someone tailgates me I pull to the side and slow a bit
right away and let them pass...what is it to me..go
for it man.Sometimes I see them up ahead next to me at
the next light or pulled over by a cop....speeding in
town sucks.If we were all animals fighting to get
ahead of one another I guess I could fight with the
best....seeing I am 6 foot tall and 230lbs without
much of a gut...but my short temper days are
passed.And any fool with a gun can put your lights out
sooooooo....the anwser is be cool...Like they say
&quot;Dont sweat the small stuff.... and it's all small
stuff&quot;    Oh yeah.....I am backing the bus up in the
driveway under the carport to do a mini
restoration.You know check the nuts and bolts and
grease the greasers detail out the engine compartment
and some re-wire and drop kick the sick
engine.....Peace Bro's be cool to Da'Listes we are one
of you....
