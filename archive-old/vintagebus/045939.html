&lt;&lt; Great.  Thanx for the info.&gt;&gt;
Hi John,
You are welcome!

&lt;&lt;  I'll be taking the gear oil back and find 90W GL-4.&gt;&gt;
We use Sta-Lube 85/90.  It is available nationwide here in the USA, and the 
price is not high.  There has been a time or two when we have had to rebuild 
a reduction box and wanted to only refill that box and top off the tranny 
center section.  Mixing oils brands and wieghts just like in engines applies 
to trannies.  Bad news!  
    If you do not know when this tranny had it's oil changed last you would 
be well off to change oil again in a thousand miles just like you would do 
with a new tranny and there after every 20,000 miles.  If you decide to use a 
more expensive oil you might want to use Sta-Lube for the first thousand 
miles.  Even though VW says every 30,000 miles if you really like longevity 
it helps to rid it of the metal shavings that get stirred up when you drive 
it since there is no real oil filter system in the tranny.  Lastly you would 
do well to find tranny plugs with the magnets to replace the five 
non-magnetic plus on the tranny/reductions.  VW only installed two in the 
center section and we feel the more the steel dust is pulled out of the oil 
the better.

&lt;&lt; I really appreciate the info.&gt;&gt;
&lt;&lt;Glad we could help.  

&lt;&lt; God I love this list. &gt;&gt;
Halelujah, fellow bus brother!    Eric&amp;Barb
