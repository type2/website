Subject: Re A/C in a Bus--

Funny thing you should ask!! On this wednesday a good friend of mine pulled up
in front of our home in his 69 single cab--which is now A/C--COLD!!  he found
the VW under dash unit in a junk yard for cheap!! also pulled the condensor from
the top of a VW bus--again for cheap!!
The condensor is now straped to the frame underneath the SC--The compressor is
from a Toyo-a, which uses very little of the HP.  This is mounted in the left
side of the engine compartment--I took photos of the set up and will be doing s
story on it--if you want more details contact Butch at    Casdorph Butch
&lt;bckcsm_at_msn_dot_com&gt;
Just say uncle jerry sent me--this was a very Low Buck installation that Works!!

PS-- ask Butch were his front seat came from!!
