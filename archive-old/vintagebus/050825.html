Subject: Re: [VB] Buying bus parts

Ditto on the no flames but...

&gt;
&gt; first: if you don't know what a part looks like or what it's called, why
&gt; are you even working on the car in the first place?

If you are not willing to help the public out then you are either a
wholesaler only or you will be going out of business.  Technical help is
part of the job.


&gt; second: not all shops want the hassle of dealing with both
&gt; in-person-at-counter and phone AND internet. not all shops have the extra
&gt; time to deal with the web and maintaining a website

I think you could go either way on this.  But, if you have a website and you
put an Email address on it then, surprise surprise, expect Email.  I sent an
Email to a guy trying to buy about $500 worth of stuff and he said I wasn't
serious cause I didn't phone him.  Well what the F* do you list an Email
address for then?  Anyway, if you have a website and only want it as an
advertisement and not as a means of communication then state how you want to
be contacted and when, including time zone.

&gt; third: YEAH RIGHT! if every shop had the time to devote to knowing what
all
&gt; their competitors were selling stuff for, nothing else could be
accomplished.

I'll agree with you here.  Your customers will tell you when you are too
high.  I think you need to have a general idea but in the end you have to
price off of your overhead, not theirs.
