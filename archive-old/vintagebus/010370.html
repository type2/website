Isaiah - my idea for a hitch will be as follows:

I'm going to create my own that fastens to the torsion tube housings AND the
rear bumper mounts in the frame on my 67 bus.  The torsion mounts will be my
pullers and the rear bumper bracket mounts in the frame will be my tongue
weight.  I'm gonna use square tubing and then here's the kicker:  I'm going
to have brackets that stay mounted to the torsions and the bumper bracket
mounts that my hitch will pop into and be held in place with hitch pins.
This way I can remove it really easy for engine pulls and such.

It's just an idea but I'm pretty sure this is how I'm going to do it.
