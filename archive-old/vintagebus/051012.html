Subject: Buying bus parts

Hi,

I wanted to soapbox about my shopping experience so far with 
'bus-oriented' retailers. I've included 'best practices' examples 
(thanks to Ronnie and Ron).

Thanks,
Conrad

----------

First

As a shopper, it is really hard when you (a) don't know what a part 
looks like (b) don't know what a part is called (c) don't know what 
parts or tools are needed to complete a job.

You would think that a retailer would recognize this and make it (a) 
easy to identify a solution to a problem (b) make it easy to identify 
parts (c) provide guidance in completing a job.

Calling someone to order parts and getting a 'duh' response doesn't 
help. I'm the buyer, you're the expert, you've seen people order this 
part before, what other parts did they need, was there any special tool 
they needed, any tips on the repair...

Second

Make it easy to buy parts from you. You should have several different 
ways to order parts - by phone, by fax, by mail, by web.

I prefer web cause I'm a web developer, that's the way i like to order 
parts. Some people prefer phone calls. Be flexible.

You should have a website by now. Your website should be easy to 
navigate, pages should load in 8-15 seconds, the buyer should be able to 
find the right part or solution in less than 5 minutes. The purchase of 
parts should be equally smooth.

Outdated material on your website - like specials from August 2000 - 
makes you look amateur. On that point, you should have something for 
people to come back for - tip of the week, or tip of the month - repair 
highlight of the month, etc.

Third

You should know what your competition sells parts for, you should know 
how they sell parts, what the buying experience is with them - and you 
should do better than them.

If you provide methods of communication with your customers, you should 
be responsive. If you have a core policy, you should have a notification 
that you received the core, that they did or did not make it back in 
time for a refund, etc.

When people buy parts, you should be able to give them a shipping ETA, a 
follow-up email or phone call if there is an unexpected delay, give them 
a website or account number to check on order status.

Reward your customers by not being a black hole. Let them know that you 
will be at a show coming up, etc.

Follow up with customers after they buy parts. Send them a 'newsletter' 
or letter of thanks. Let them know if you have any new parts or 
specials. Customers will reward you with purchases.
