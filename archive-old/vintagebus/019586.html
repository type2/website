See what I tell you.  Look how steamed these puckers
are getting.  Sorry to upset you so much by letting
this guy now the otherside of the coin in the puck
values.  Again, that is what this list is for is it
not?  To compare differences in opinions?  If
everytime someone gave an opposing opinion on
something they got flamed as bad as you two have done,
no wonder the list becomes only a hand full of a
couple folks posting over and over and the rest all
lurkers. Now you said this...
  
&gt; Not missing the point. What I see is that you are
&gt; a.&gt; misinformed
&gt; b.&gt; for some reason have a hard-on for me.
&gt; (jealousy,
&gt; immaturity, pure ignorance?) I dont get it.

Correct you probably do not know who I am.  I am not a
loud mouth at shows and law low.  Thus how can YOU
call me &quot;misinformed&quot; for all you know I could be the
&quot;god all&quot; expert on travel trailers and pucks?!  Am I
not right.  And b&gt; having a &quot;hard on&quot; for you he he!! 
don't think so. Your not that cute and a liitle too
old for me.  Also, I have seen your vehicles and they
are far from anything to be jealous about :)

Again to recap all my post was these things aren't
necessarily worth $4500-$8500.  Lets lighten up here
guys.  Again, am I not allowed my opinions?
