Subject: Ive got rims!
Message-ID: &lt;0.4cf269f1.2533d20b_at_aol_dot_com&gt;

Hello list-
I finally found some 15 inch rims today. I'm gonna have them sandblasted and 
powder-coated soon once I find a powdercoater nearby.  After that I need 
tires.
(Ive checked the archives and library, but there's not too much talk about 
15's) What kind of  (radial) tires would give me stock appearance (please no 
meat cleavers!) and stock ride height , while giving a decent ride.   I'd 
love some numbers for reference and maybe some brands.(ps. what were the size 
of stock tires).
Thanx-
