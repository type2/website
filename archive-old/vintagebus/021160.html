Yeah, but what would you rather have? Quality or
quantity?
Mike

&gt; It's a real shame the split and bay guys can't get
&gt; together on the west
&gt; coast.  Here in the midwest and on the east coast,
&gt; if we did not admit the
&gt; bays and even the vanagons and EC's, our meets and
&gt; campouts would be very
&gt; small.
