Subject: VW parts vendor with fastest delivery...

Howdy Y'all,
I am a lonely Midwesterner (ie. No VW parts dealers
ANYWHERE near).  I am looking for a good vendor that
has good, fast delivery service. I have been ordering
most of my parts from Cip1_dot_com, but by the time they
ship from their warehouse in British Columbia to the
distrubution center in Washington State, and then to
me in Ohio, it is usually close to 2 weeks before I
get my parts.  I am needing a rocker panel for my 67
bus ASAP. I wanted to order from Bus Depot, they had
the part for lowest price, but their customer service
quoted me $30+ dollars shipping on the part which only
cost $27, so obviously NOT an option in this
situation. The 2 specific companies I am wondering
about are Wolfsburg West and Bus-Boys. So any
Midwesterners who have ordered from them and can
remark on their delivery times\service??? Any other
vendors I don't know about???

Peace, John Baker
