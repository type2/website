Several people asked me where I got the idea that there was a standard way
of mounting heaters in the rear seat of a Crew/Double Cab.  Here are the
archive messages that pointed me to this...  I went back to the archives as
I was writing this message and actually came up with a great message, that
describes one person's install in a 1964 Double Cab!

 === How to install in Double Cab ===
Mark Chambers wrote in October 1996:

 === How to install in Double Cab ===

The question is... was this rear seat mounting something the factory ever
did?  I like the idea of keeping the left side of the engine bay free for a
second battery (to power the heater when camping).

Here is some further research on general installation.

Dean Aukee asked a year ago if anyone had seen a factory install this way.
From what I can tell, there were no (public) answers on the list.

Thom talks about &quot;stock&quot; gas heater in a Split, but not specific to
Single/Double cabs:

Jim Bryant adds to Thom that having them mounted below the dash is something
he has seen:

Matt Henricks is the one who says that Crew Cabs have them mounted in the
rear seat, but no details of air ducting or fuel lines:

So that should tell you how I reached this idea...

P.S.  I know of a '65 Crew Cab for sale in Spokane area.  I visited it and
have photos... rockers are real bad on both sides, but owner is having
somone take care of it.  Bed is nice, including gates, photos should show it
all...
