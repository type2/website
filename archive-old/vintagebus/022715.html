Way completely wrong.  Like Oprah in a thong.

Send it back.

I used the Wolfsburg West ones.  They look nice, and have only minimal
warping after sitting outside under  covered storage.  I could have avoided
some of the warping by using more screws.

&gt;Recently I ordered a headliner for my 1967 single cab from Calif. Imports 
&gt;(their #T20-2107-44) for 1965-74 single cabs.  My understanding is that my 
&gt;headliner should be cardboard (fiberboard?) like the kick panels.  What came 
&gt;is a vinyl, perforated headliner that looks like half a beetle's headliner.  
&gt;And it's one rectangular piece, with no provision for the roof vent.
&gt;
&gt;What gives?  Is this completely wrong?  Does it have to be cut?  Does it 
&gt;cover the cardboard headliner?  What?  I do have the parts book, and it
shows 
&gt;two separate pieces for the headliner.--David
