 Hi Eric &amp; Barb, 
 Well, my '67 was a pop top Westy. I'm replacing the pop top with a canvas 
sunroof about the same size. I guess because it was originally just the small 
pop top is why it didn't have a subfloor?    Jerry &gt;&gt;
Hi Jerry,
Correct!  The smaller the hole in the body the less it affects it.  Eric&amp;Barb

the sunroof buses have a huge ole in the roof.  if you look at a regular bus 
roof, you will see it sunroof hole would cross where thereis a reinforvement. 
 he westy poptop hole does not.    It is alo much smaller than the stock 
sunroof gap.    westys also have wood supports around the poptop (?)
