I visited my bus in the resto shop (Wilson's Auto Restoration, Owings, MD) a
couple days ago and the fella wanted to know what the information was for my
paint.  I told him that there was an exact match in the Glasurit 21 line and
that the colors were L311 and L312. He said that he needs a paint chip for
each so that he can match it with the computer.  Is there any source for such
a thing?  I am thinking I should just make him shoot the Glasurit, but I want
the paint to come out good.  I don't want to give him the excuse that he was
not used to the type of paint.  But I also don't want to have my bus next to
another bus in the same colors only to see that it is WAY off.  Other than
that, progress is looking very good.

A note about paint codes and recipes and the colours they produce.   IMO it is
very  important to do a test patch/have a colour to match.  When I got the
bluewhite mixed for my 65 westy it came out a couple shades too gree.  Someone
mentioned recently that someone else's bluewhite did the same thing- I wonder
if they used the PPG paint mix.   I had the paint shop remix it to the right
shade, and it came out great.   They were very nice about it, and were
apologetic they didn't get it just right the first time.     The top of my bus
has a LOT of paint on it now.  :)    It is difficult to get it right.    Be
picky.    Do you have some original paint inside the bus, like behind the
seat, or the insides of the front doors where you could do a test blob and
compare?

I looked at a half dozen velvet green buses, and saw a half dozen different
shades.     I think my velvet green is a tad too light, but good enough for a
driver.   The bluewhite was way too far off, That did get redone.  

I don't know if this helps at all. Perhaps for the top colour you could us the
radio block out plate or rear part of the fresh air grill or something if you
have something with clean original paint on it.   Clean and polish it if he
needs something small to match it with.
