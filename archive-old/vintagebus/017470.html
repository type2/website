Well,

I read this thread with some interest and guilt and have
decided to come out of the closet!

Some of you are aware that I have a US 23 window
that I bought back to Oz nearly 3 years ago.  Importing
a LHD bus leaves you a number of hard decisions...One is 
 whether to convert to RHD.  I did convert - at the time
the law required it for 'normal' road reg (law has now changed)
but I would have done it anyway I think.  The bus will be driven
lots and here in Oz we still have many major highways which are
still single lane........overtaking with LHD would be quite an adventure
and always require a co-pilot to be in the bus.......to be honest I think
you'd have to look pretty damn hard to detect the conversion...

The other issue was cargo doors on the RHS.  Basically any passengers
(like my kids) would always be getting out in traffic....not ideal for
me....you can see my solution at

Suiting up now!
