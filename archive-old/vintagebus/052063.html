Subject: Progressive carbs, was Baywindow to Split MC conversion fluid reservoir notes

Also the progresive was on the79-8 ?something mustangs(some had electric
chokes as well) and rangers thru 84 i think 2.3liter engine as well as the
pinto 2.0 (which had the water choke system). If i rember correctly there
might have been a base plate issue but nothing serious, later
