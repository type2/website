Subject: [VB] nose skin replacement
Message-Id: &lt;v02130500b4875cd135af_at_[209.245.213.16]&gt;

Has any one done the WHOLE thing? How bout some tips?
I have a replacement nose ( I mean the WHOLE nose, from the pedals
forward!), and while I can get the OLD skin off, I don't want to mangle the
new while removing it or replacing it.
The side seams are easy, and the top is simply cut free below the wipers,
but the bottom is tricky - VW had SIX pieces of metal meeting here; some
are crimped and others are crimped AND welded.
What I need to know is how best to undo the donor nose, so I may use as
much of the lower pieces as possible on the new bus. Do I find and drill
out all the spotwelds on this seam? Should I cut it away and where? The old
nose removal is easy, as I just saw off what I am going to replace.

As a bonus, the more metal bits at that bottom seam you folks help me save,
the more already-purchased Alan Schofield (sp?) pieces I won't need and can
release to the list at a hefty discount :)
