Subject: Re: [VB] opening semaphores

Yes - you have to push the little catch at the top down.  It's at
the back (ie the mounting plate) and is spring-loaded.  It's a b*tch
with the semi in the car. 

Pry the semaphore up until you get a little resistance, then feel for 
a low spot just in front of the back plate, while pishing down.

You'll see a pivot point around the plunger - that's where you're pushing

&gt; I need to open my semaphores on my 59 so I can change the bulbs to 12 volt. 
&gt; Is there a way to open them?  I have tried pulling them up, they come to a 
&gt; point and then get stiff and I don't want to force them open.  I got some 
&gt; advice from a good list member, but the wise man gets wiser by asking more 
&gt; questions...
