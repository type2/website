Subject: Re: 6v-110V inverters?

&gt;Does anyone know if you can get a 6v to 110V inverter to be able to charge
&gt;one's cell phone while in an early bus?

They might have existed back in the day but now you'd probably have to
make one if you wanted one.

If you can get a 12 V charging cord for your phone, you might have more
success.  If you're really lucky, it might just work on 6 V.  Try it and
see...  the worst that can probably happen is that your phone won't charge.

If the output of your 110 V charger is less than about 4.7 V DC or so, you
might be able to build a simple regulator with Radio Shack parts to drop
the Bus' 6 V down for your phone.  If your phone doesn't take a normal
power connector, you'll have to cut up an existing charger for the
connector.

One option is to use a 12 V charging cord for your phone and a small 
12 V gel-cell battery.  I have one here that is 12 V, 7 Ah, weighs about
3 pounds (1.4 kg), and is about 6x1.5x3.75 inches (15x3.5x9.5 cm).  It
cost me about $15 at the local electronics distributor (_not_ Radio
Shack.)  A battery this size would fully charge most cell phone
batteries maybe 3 to 7 times before becoming depleted itself.  When the
gel-cell gets depleted, you can charge it with a small (1 or 2 amp)
battery charger made for car or motorcycle batteries.  If you do this,
put a reasonable fuse (5 A or so) in the positive wire between the
battery and the cigarette lighter socket, as the battery is capable of
several hundred amps of current in a short-circuit situation.

If you want to be clever, you can buy a 6 V gel cell battery and wire it
in series with your Bus.  Your cigarette lighter socket ground goes to
the Bus body.  A wire from the Bus +6 V goes to the negative side of the
battery.  Your cigarette lighter socket hot goes to the positive side of
the battery.  The 6 V from the battery gets added to the 6 V from the
battery/generator and you've got 12 V.

The super extra sneaky hidden bonus part of this is that when you're not
actively charging the cell phone, you can rewire the 6 V battery so it
is charged by your Bus!  Just connect the battery negative to the Bus
body and the battery positive to a hot-all-the-time wire in the Bus.
Even if you're not driving, your starting battery will charge up the gel
cell without too much loss of capacity.

You can install a DPDT switch to automate this process, if you like.

&gt;I have looked all over the web and googled but find only a plethora of
&gt;12 V inverters

Unfortunately, the Web and 6 V inverters only missed each other by about
30 years or so.

Good luck!
