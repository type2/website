Subject: Re: [VB] A.I.R.S. in VW trends

For the record, Craig's tongue was firmly placed in his cheek when he 
made that comment. Even though Craig's not really a hippie, he is a 
long-hair who travels with his dog in his VW bus, rides his bicycle 
around town, recycles EVERYTHING he can and DEFINATLY would be 
considered a hippie in any redneck TX town without a doubt (Sorry 
Craig!).

This list can really be a little TOO politically correct sometimes. 
Everyone take a deep breath 'cause the REAL hippie's are laughing at 
what he wrote.
