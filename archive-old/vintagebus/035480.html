 &lt;&lt; A guy named Earl here in town got sideswiped in his '52 Panel (again!) and
  could use the following:
  1. Passenger door
  2. Passenger rear corner or, preferably, Passenger rear side from corner to
  cargo door pillar.  I believe the lower 1/2 is all that is needed.
  
  He would prefer Barndoor panels but will take others.
  
  Prefer location close to Phoenix, AZ, to minimize shipping. &gt;&gt;
 
 Damn, he sure is asking for a lot. What else would he like while i'm out 
 there with the saw cutting up a bd with salvageable metal?

the other day someone asked my if I had any BD reduction boxes lying around- 
they wanted some to put in their baja- cause they could convert it to RGBoxes 
w/o having to mess with the spring plates as they will bolt onto bug spring 
plates straight up evidently.  So could you grab those for this guy's baja 
bug?

but really - hey Earl won't find it if he doesn't ask-   realise this guy 
actually does drive his 52 bus around.
