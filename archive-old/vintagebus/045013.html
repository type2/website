Does anyone know where I can get hinges for my pop-out windows?
1962 15 window.
I have the glass and frames and the latches.
Just need a way to mount them to my Deluxe.
I got my bus with the windows out and hinges removed and missing.
Two were there, the ones on each side of rear seat.
Left side and cargo doors missing hinges.
I have four pop-out windows sitting on the seat.
I would like to get them in their holes.- - - -

Better buses came with only the 2 pop outs.  Does your bus have M code 114?
if not, yours came with two.   are there holes to attach the pop out latches?
   I have been know to remove the extra pop outs, as they are a leaking PITA,
but as you live in the dry, I see your point.   Gotta find them off a bus or
junkyard .  I mangled the ones I removed and tossed them.
