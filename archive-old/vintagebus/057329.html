Subject: Re: [VB] Re: [T2] .009, There MUST be some advantages


The cap used on the 010 &amp; 019 is the same
&gt; used on the old German 
&gt; and modern Brazilian built 009s and can be had for
&gt; less than $10.00.

Hello-
They are a different cap from what I can tell and are
also black (bosch)not brown. The cap for an 010 and
019 has a cresent cut out on it to clear the bolt that
holds the condensor wire on. I think they also have a
different method of attachment to the dist body
itself.
Or am I thinking of the rotor that is expensive? I
would have to go out and look.
