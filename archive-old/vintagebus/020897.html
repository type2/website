Subject: Re: [VB] Source for ceiling panels

Be careful if you are using home insulation on a bus. 
I have a remarkably rust free midwest bus that I am
restoring.  The only major rust was in the doors and
it was caused by moisture held in by the pink
fiberglass insulation.  Any insulation should be
attached to the inner door panels and not the metal. 
I know that you are interested mainly in the ceiling
panels but I thought that I should give you a word of
warning anyhow.  INSULATION BREEDS RUST!

&gt; Hey,
&gt; 
&gt; Does anyone have a source for the ceiling panels
&gt; above the driver and
&gt; passenger seats?  If nothing else, I am looking to
&gt; get the correct
&gt; dimensions for them(maybe a pattern?), so I can make
&gt; them myself.
&gt; 
&gt; I am in the process of putting insulation up in the
&gt; ceiling to guard against
&gt; the elements.  Right now to guard against the
&gt; Florida heat, but I want to
&gt; insulate against colder climates.  I went to the
&gt; Depot and picked up a roll
&gt; of pink panther insulation, and I have the rear
&gt; sections all figured out.
&gt; The next challange will be the cab.
&gt; 
&gt; Any help appreciated! - Kevin
