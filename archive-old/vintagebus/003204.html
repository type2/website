I bought a splitty again last week. Found it in a barn as had not been on
the road in a while. Has a little rust on the surface. I put fresh gas and
battery in and started right up (there is a little knock)!

Anyway, I only paid $50.00 for it so I plan to drive it to Every Bus and
demonstrate what an engine fire can do! I will drive it to that field away
from everyone at the end of the campout area and disconnect a fuel line and
set the whole bus on fire to show how everyone who loves their busses can
see what neglect can lead to! Everyone will learn a valuable lesson. It will
only cost the $50.00 I spent and the gas to get there. Anybody want all
those seats ahead of time?  It is not a camper so I might get those upper
roof glass and corner glass parts out if anyone wants them before the fire,
but is supposed to be a &quot;surprise&quot; thing, so keep it quiet. Let me know.

Might also be a good drill for the local fire department.

Peace,

Ric.
