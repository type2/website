Subject: Sundial Interior

Many thanks for all who responded to my inquiry about camper interiors.
This last weekend I purchased a very complete Sundial interior from Matt
and Katie in Torrence, CA. Thanks Matt!!
    P.S.  I have a servicable westy z-bed now that needs a home.  I
would be willing to give it away to a listee if you come and get it.  My
wife is unthrilled about it sitting on our front porch,   This is not a
creampuff bed but the padding and vinyl are good, only one small tear,
It's very comfy!! It's also the original yellowish/brownish vinyl.
    Any takers?  I hate to just throw it away but I have no room to keep
it.
Thanks,
Jon 65 Quasi-sundial
