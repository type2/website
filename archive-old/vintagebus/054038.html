breaking loose those 250 foot-pounder axle nuts on a tranny that is NOT on a

Hi Joel,
Install a wheel on each drum and have a friend wrap himself around the tire 
like he is making love to it while you wrench on the axle nut.  If that does 
not keep it from turning take a junker type 1 rim large five lug and weld a 
pipe to one side of the rim in line where the tire would go.  We like to make 
this pipe as big a diameter as possible from our junk pile so as to allow 
inserting a slightly smaller longer pipe (About 12' or longer.) in it to 
really add leverage to the rim.  Then use a Proto 3/4&quot; breaker bar and a 
cheater bar up to 10' long to break it loose.   Eric&amp;Barb
