Subject: Keep vintagebus_dot_com roundy free!!
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

The subject says it all.  There are too damn many of those things.  First you 
let a couple in then next thing you know they are all over, like a bad 
disease.  Why cant someone start latemodel_dot_com or something?  It is nice to 
know there is a site to look at where I know I wont have to filter through 
roundys to see the good stuff.
