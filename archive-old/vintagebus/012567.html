The lurking VanBondo sez,
I have yet to reinstall the interior in my 63 bus. Excepting for a hunk of
dumpster dive carpeting and the old blanket seat cover that I sit on- it is
a shell.

Seriously, the quick fix that I have been using for sound deadening during
my hour long commute &lt;each way&gt; is a $3.00 pair of gun shooters ear plugs.
Drops the decibles by 7 and helps me to hear the engine and not much else.

I'm out of the cruising for chicks scene so I dont give a **** about looking
&quot;cool&quot;. It also cuts down on hearing folks yelling and honking at me as they
scream by in their SUV's. Sometimes life is simple. =)
