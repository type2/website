 Hi Chris,
rent a drum puller (Do not use the type that only 
 bolts to three of the lug nuts!  Best is one that hooks the drum edge.)  &gt;&gt;

I'll second that!!!!  I used one of those puller that bolt on to three lug 
nuts and it stripped out the threads in the drum.   That really sucked, as I 
was going to college full time, working at Round Table Pizza part time, and 
was riding the bus (public transit) to get from point a to point b.  In my 
copious free time I was working on the bus to get it going again.  Social 
life?  hah!  I lived five miles out of town, the bus came to 1/2 mile from my 
house, but that route was only 3 times/day, so I would walk 2  miles to the 
bus stop where it came every 1/2 hour.   Except I could get a ride to town 
with my housemate in the morning at  least, so at least  I could make it on 
time to my 8am class.   Going to rent the puller was a three hour bus ride.  
Each way.  (about a twenty five minute drive)  Did I mention my splitty was 5 
miles away from my house because when the tranny died I was afraid the tow 
truck couldn't make it up my road, so it went to my friend's house?   I lived 
at the end of this road that every one took in 1st gear, except me cause I 
had a split case tranny with little nut RGBs, so I used 2nd.  steep hill up 
on one side, steep hill down on the other, only room for one car at a time.  
I had seen people drive off  that road down the hill.  Dumm kopf!  gave up on 
pulling the drum off the old tranny, and managed to undo the brake cable up 
front, undo the keeper on the inside of the drum, and wiggle the brake cable 
out.   Took a lot longer than it should have to swap the trannies.  Weeks.   
Plus it was filthy I was so grease slimed.  Gee that was fun.  Didn't have 
time to be bored.
