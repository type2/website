&gt;&gt;Adrian previously writ:
 
 Also on temps run a VDO gauge and see what you are running before spending
 the time on an external cooler.  Here are the general Porsche numbers (356,
 914, and 911):
 176-210 running cool
 220 Normal 
 230 Warm
 240 Hot
 250 Too Hot
  &gt;&gt;

&gt;&gt;Then Clara writ:
but this is not a porsche....   But you are saying that 220 is normal? in a 
upright ACVW- I though oil degrades about 225-230.  In fact I've seen a 
difference in consistancy after it's run that hot.     I thought 176-210 was

ideal, if it was below that after it had warmed up it would be too cool.
&lt;&lt;

&quot;This can happen at temperatures as low as 230º F and by 250º F many
petroleum oils are suffering significant breakdown.&quot;

&quot;Oil temperatures of 230ºF to 250ºF are not at all uncommon in driver's
education track conditions, particularly in early 911s with no front coolers
or the marginally effective &quot;trombone&quot; oil coolers. These temperatures are
also fairly common in air-cooled engines in summer time stop and go traffic
with the A/C on. Further, temperatures on the cylinder walls and in turbos
are often over 450°F for short periods of time. &quot;

&quot;Most companies don't bother to tell you that synthetic oils are capable of
going 25,000 miles or more without significant breakdown.&quot;

In all honesty if I do not find contaminants in the oil when I change
it(like gas), I am switching to Mobil 1 15W-50 like I run in the Porsche.  I
have an almost leak free rebuild so I cannot imagine that too much new
leakage will form...  Although I worry about the gasket deterioration.
Change interval would be at 6000 miles/every second tune-up.

I used to have a '69 Beetle, stock 1600 SP, and it normally ran at 220.
When it would nudge 230 I backed off the gas until it cooled down though.  I
have been verbally told by a few long time VW people that 250 is the max and
not to worry unless it creeps past 240.  This thought would follow along the
same Porsche guidelines.

Clara, I totally agree that 220 is a little high for everyday normal use.
On a road trip I would let it get to 230 before I pulled over or let off the
gas though.  My idea of a perfect normal temperature is 190 for any air
cooler.  The 911 I have runs super cool right at 180 most of the time, on
the track I got it to hit 225 once though which is still pretty cool.

Stinkin' oil!!!

&quot;The tax man strode into most American lives after the bombing of Pearl
Harbor. To raise a war chest, income taxes - once reserved for the rich -
were extended to all Americans for the first time in history. The expanded
tax was supposed to be temporary, ending with the war.&quot;
Support the FLAT TAX movement.  And shutdown the un-Constitutional and
unfair IRS.
