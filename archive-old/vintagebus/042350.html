Perhaps in the volkswagen community a new e-business model has come to the
fore?

Stephen,

Alas, no...  this isn't a new model, it is the same old model brought to a
new medium :-( And (mostly) it isn't intent to deceive on the part of the
owners either.  *MOST* small businesses fail... the successes are the
exception, not the rule.  The failure is a long painful process where more
is spent than it taken in, money from new orders goes to pay for old
orders and problems and complaints build to an unsupportable level.  When
the business finally &quot;fails&quot; in public, it is way behind and the late
orderers lose.  I don't know that this has happened in any specific case,
but have seen enough small business failures to know the general route :-(

Running a small business is a high wire act. Running it on the list or in
the internet is a lot like going on a blind date with a crew from a
tabloid TV show along to critique.  There is a good chance that *any*
screwup, no matter how minor is going to be reported to your entire
customer universe!  

At the same time, reporting is one of the things the lists are about.  In
the bad old days, mail order companies could go on for years collecting
checks.  J.C. Whitney went through a bad spell a couple years back that
took 3-4 years to build up and a lot of people eventually lost money.  At
the same time, reorganizations happen, and they are now back on their feet
(with, alas, a much smaller VW section :-(
