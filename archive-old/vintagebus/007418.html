I too would like to hear from a list-member-insurance-agent with a solution
for the &quot;multi-multi-vehicle owner.&quot; My wife and I with 3 non-driving-age
kiddies insure each of 5 running vehicles, and don't cover the hightop
project at all.  We can only drive 2 vehicles at any time given the
constraints of physics, but the insurance companies think we must insure all
5 since they are each occasionally driven. There should be some sensible
plan out there to insure a DRIVER, not a car...but I've not found this.
Thanks,
Jay in Indiana

. I do agree with Thom though about the need to get your buses
&gt;insured and have coverage on all my buses also.
