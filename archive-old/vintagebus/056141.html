Subject: Re: [VB] clutch interchange??

There are 180mm and 200mm clutch assys. The 12V flywheel is probably 200mm,
don't know about the 6V flywheel

&gt; I recently purchased a clutch and pressure plate for my 66 Panel 6 volt.
I
&gt; now am in need of the same for my 59 panel 12 volt.  It shouldn't matter
in
&gt; the clutch and presssure plate right?  The only diffence would be in the
&gt; flywheel?  I'd hate to have to order another one when I have one with only
10
&gt; miles on the set up I have...Any help?? Thanks in advance..
