I couldn't agree with Thom more.  I live in a &quot;planned community&quot; with plenty 
of restrictions.  I've received letters &quot;reminding&quot; me that I can't leave the 
trash can out on non-collection days.  I've had some letters &quot;reminding&quot; me 
that I need to keep the weeds/grass out of the rock landscaped areas.  I have 
NEVER  had a letter telling me anything about my Volkswagens.  And I have had 
several, all at the same time.  Non-running in the garage.  Non-running in 
the back yard.  Running, regestered vehicles in front of the house, on the 
street or in the driveway.  If you want the lifestyle of living in a place 
like this, then follow the rules.  If you want to park hulks on the front 
lawn, then find a place where that is acceptable.  It is possible to be a VW 
lover regardless of your preffered lifestyle.

Just my Friday's 2 cents worth.
