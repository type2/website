Subject: Shift lever tricks?

Hi (help)

I took the shift lever and front rod off to clean it and to replace the
front shift rod bushing (there wasn't one).  Now, with fresh grease all over
everywhere (including the computer....) I am having a most grievous time
getting the ball of the shifter, with its pin that keeps on moving out, back
into the cup.  Is there some trick to this?  I am getting mad.

Oh...it's a '66...

I'll go fix something else for a bit, and try again.  Any tips would be
greatly appreciated.

Thanks, Gene
