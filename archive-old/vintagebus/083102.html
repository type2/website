Subject: Re: [VB] carpet

Purchase the carpet of your choice. Cut to fit the area, Use your rubber mat 
as a pattern. Have your local carpet store bind the edges for a nice clean 
look. I have not had to glue anything down. Remember, gravity sucks. In the 
cab area, all the stuff sticking up out of the floor will hold the carpet in 
place.
