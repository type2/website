Subject: Tool #

Hey NQ
I just picked one up at Sears right off the
shelf...considering how often I would ever use the
tool, I'm fine with Craftsman on this one.

Just curious if anyone had a part number or any kind
of reference material for the triple square spline
socket that Snap On makes/made for removal of
the CV joint bolts on aircooled IRS rear ends in bugs
and buses?  I lost mine and need to replace it. 
Thanks! NQ
