 it was the loose fanbelt, although that doesn't really make sense to me. &gt;&gt;
Hi Kevin,
Right, it probably was the loose fan belt.  We were driving in 40F weather
one day at 3,000 RPM on the highway and suddenly we both noticed that the
heat was smelling hot.  Looked down at the oil temp gauge and saw it going
&gt;from it's normal 160F to 180F to 190F to 200F in about 15 seconds, I turned
off the engine and coasted to the side of the road.  Turned out that the fan
belt had shredderized down to literally a thread that kept the generator
pulley turning just enough to keep the generator idiot light out but slipped
so much that the generator/cooling fan was not doing the high RPM that it was
supposed to.  Thusly since the cooling fan was not turning as fast as normal
the amount of cooling air dropped off and the engine headed toward
overheating.  The same can and will happen due to too lose of fan belt also.
