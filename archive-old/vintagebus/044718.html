Boy safari frames are a pain to put together!
If the glass is too thick, forget it.
I used NOS rubber with original glass and *STILL* had problems!
BFY was selling the glass for a while.....not sure if it still is available 
through them.
You can take original stock windshield glass and &quot;trim&quot; it down to fit. 
Thats what i did.

&lt;&lt;Hi All.


I was trying to put together my safaris last night and realized that the

windows I have are complete SH^T (that's all caps for a reason!).  The

corners are all wrong and they are actually too narrow...  I'd tell you who

made them but let's not all go there.


Anyway, who makes good safari glass for original frames that IS the right

size and shape?  Or, who has that original pair in their garage that they're

willing to part with for a few thousand dollars. ;-)


Also, I noticed that the rubber seals (WCM) stretch quite a bit and I always

ended up with extra that could not be crammed into the rail... even though I

soaped everything up real good.  How do you do it right?  But then again,

maybe this happened since my glass is the wrong size.
