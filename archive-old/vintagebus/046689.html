I was looking through the pictures.......nice ass on that one guy BTW.

where's all the busses?  I was hoping to see lines of them....exotic 
barndoors and odd utility vehicles, but I guess not.  

I noticed in picture bc99003 - that sort of looks like Ronnie from the Old 
Volks Home in Lake Havasu AZ standing there with his legs crossed in the 
white sweatshirt and jeans with his back to the camera.  I'm not positive, 
but that might be the guy supplying us all with the replacement sheet metal.

Also, picture bc99022 is without a doubt Richard Kimbrough aka Rustybus.  The 
same one we came in second place in the Berg Ralley with 2 weekends ago.  He 
drives the rusty as can be factory ragtop standard with the light up neon 
front emblem.....some of you know him.

Just some observations
