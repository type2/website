My Bus lurched from the garage yesterday in its first steps in over 10 
years. The headlights lit up brightly and it just looked happy to be 
breathing again. I drove it around the neighbor at 2 in the morning, and it 
was great, well except for the fact that there were no front windshields. 
Another Bus on the road.
