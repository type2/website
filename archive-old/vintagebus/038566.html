Wow! You just made my day! I'm so glad I thought of this too! I was going to
get a bonded title, or whatever the dmv wanted... But I think you solved my
dilema! Wooo! So just show the dmv the birth certificate and explain the
problem? Is there a quicker way to prove that the title # is the engine
number? I thought I heard that recieving the letter from Germany takes a bit
of time... Thank you!!!!!!!
