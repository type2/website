what weight oil?
what outside temp?
what engine temp?

you can test the sender in boiling water it just take some work
having the sender close to the bus in boiling water with the ground and
sender wire hooked up using the bus gauge systems and battery
also removing the sender ( were is it ) and not dumping the oil
we have been there and did this 
but you should take your altitude in the temp reading because water
boils at
sea level is 212 deg F
at 3000 ft is about 200 deg F

we run 30 lbs at 225 deg F at 3000 rpms with 20w50 oil
old?? 1600 ?? sp

on the highway today I am looking at about 12 to
&gt; 20 psi at 3500 rpm. Not good right? Can I use a thicker oil to help
&gt; compensate? I assume my guage reads slightly lower, cause it reads lower
&gt; then zero when I turn the key on and then goes higher when the engine
&gt; starts. Still as the motor warms up it reads 20 to 40 then drops way off
&gt; when hot.
