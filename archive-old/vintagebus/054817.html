&gt;Engine was prolly FI, but I can't read German very well and I don't
&gt;have a database for most of the late 70s European engine codes 
&gt;to tell me what they are (FI vs Carb).

&quot;Einspritz&quot; is fuel injection and &quot;vergaser&quot; is carburetor, if that
helps any.  As far as the engine codes, Muir has AF, AS, and AJ
from '75 on in Beetles.  Wilson has AJ as a stock engine, AS as a 
service replacement case, and doesn't mention AF at all.

Doliwa has a chart showing Bus engine availablity by year and another
one with engine codes.  Apparently in Europe you could get a 1600 in
a Bus right through to 1980!  The engine code list shows 1600s with
B, AB, AD, AE, AF, AS, and C codes.  The only clues I can gain from
the text are that in '71, AD and AB were carb motors, and in '75,
AS motors had carbs.  This book only covers Buses, though.
