Hi Robert,
Well it would be of much interest even for up here if you could produce them 
out of stainless steel!  Preferably of salt resistant alloy.  We suggested 
this to Jim Patterson of &quot;House Of Ghia&quot; years ago for inner/outer rocker K. 
Ghia panels and since they have had no problems with selling them all over 
the world.....  Eric&amp;Barb
