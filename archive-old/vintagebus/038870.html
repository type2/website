All this talk about painting...

I painted my 67 Westfalia on a calm morning outside last year, i wore a canister
respirator, goggles, disposable hooded painters coveralls, and latex gloves. I
was painting with a product called Imron. Before i finished my nose started
bleeding and I couldn't breath without gasping, I spent the night in the
hospital, hooked up to a respirator. I burnt all the skin inside my nose and
sinuses, things in that area still aren't back to normal. So now I replace
panels, do metal work, stuff like that and leave the painting to the
professionals.
