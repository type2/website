&lt;&lt;  1)  Am I correct to assume that the air coming out of the doghouse is not
 warm, it is just outside air and really hadn't had a chance to warm up UNTIL
 it hits the heat exchangers?  In other words, the doghouse cooling air isn't
 yet warmed...?
   2)  If #1 is correct, couldn't I just plug the two holes entirely, and use
 the electric fan to generate all of the air flow? &gt;&gt;
Hi Stephen,
Right about #1.  The problem with #2 is that the stock heat exchangers have to
have cooling air going through them at all times especially when the weather
is warm and the heater is turned off.  Driving with the cooling air blocked to
the heat exchangers will make the engine run at 20-30F higher oil temps.  The
stock heaters have a double valve system that runs cooling air through them
when the heater is shut off.  This helps cool the exaust gasses instead of
letting the heat in the exchanger build up.  With the exuast gasses cooled #3
&amp; #1 cylinders have the stock back pressure.  With the heaters not cooling
then the exaust gasses do not cool and shrink, causing back pressure and
overheating.  Since electric motors are not as reliable as the stock
mechanical fan you would give up this reliabilty of your engine.    Eric &amp;
