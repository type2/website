&gt; &gt;Then the rain came, six volt wipers in heavy rain, manually turning 
&gt; &gt;them on and off not to burn the motor out, for the next hundred miles

&gt; ...What I'm trying to say is
&gt; that a tail light wired in-line in the wiper motor hot lead might
&gt; be a good field expedient replacement for a volt-a-drop.  The
&gt; bulb will light up and get warm, though, so you will want to
&gt; put it where it won't glare on the windshield or ignite anything.

Keep in mind that the resistance of lamp filiments varies greatly with
their temperature.  The resistance will be a lot less when the bulb is
cold (or half-on) so the wiper moter will see a lot more voltage.  Better
to use a real dropping resistor or a voltage regulator IC.
