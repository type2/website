Subject: Hey, who's rippin off vintagebus_dot_com????

I sent an email too, with no reply.  I have in the past used the ebay email system to send messages to the buyers that they're being had.

(downloaded and printed W.O.G. '69 for the torque values for my trans replacement, did not sell it :)


&gt;These people are like weeds. I send them mail saying &gt;that these auctions are against ebay policy; you &gt;cannot sell CD-Rs compiled from information from the &gt;web, especially if you don't hold the copyright.  No &gt;one ever replies.
&gt;Its too much trouble to report each one to eBay to &gt;have it removed. I guess that if one in ten of the &gt;auctions ends in a sale, the rip off guys make &gt;money.
