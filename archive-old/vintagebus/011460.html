Had to loan my son the SP out of my Kombi and its time to replace it. I've
done a few top ends and want to do this engine right so I thought I'd ask
the collective wisdom of the list. I have a 71 DP engine out of my old bus
that I'll send the case out to be machined. Here's what I thought I'd do,
1. Have case and heads cut for 90.5s
2.Purchase a counterweighted crank 69 , 74, 76,? What do you think?
3.Have rotating mass balanced for longevity
 I have a set of Kadron's to install and a new stock exhaust system to
install on this motor. I plan on installing a type 4 oil cooler and all tin
and flaps and thermostat
 I plan on about 7.1 to 7.6 CR I haven't talked to a builder yet.
Will the stock exhaust flow enough for this engine or will  I have to use a
Quiet Pack?
Any and all advice will be appreciated as well as any experiences with
similar set ups
Britt
