&gt; the Solvang show completly sucked.

Really Greg, don't hold back. tell us how you REALLY feel!

But you pegged it on the nose, I felt ripped off. Solvang has always 
been one of my favorite shows (right behind Familienfest, of 
course!). This was the 4th one I'd been to. It's always a great 
turn-out, it's in a GREAT location (well, the whole Buellton/Solvang 
area) and it's always near my birthday which is fun.

This year I knew there was trouble when they asked for $20 from me at 
the gate. I should have parked it there and walked in. Stupid me 
paid, and drove into the show area. When I say show area, what I 
really mean is the compacted parking lot. I barely had room to open 
my cargo doors (glad I didn't want to set up my tent).

Then, we (Strictly Vintage 2s) finds out that someone else is there 
selling the exact same food we are selling. Now, we were specifically 
ASKED to provide dogs, brats and sodas for this show. We spent a 
couple hundred dollars on food and hauled it all up to the show. 
We're happy to do it, but not so happy when we lose money on the 
deal. We ended up doing ok on the food, but it was still a shock that 
no one there knew we were going to be there. 

The final insult was the &quot;raffle&quot;. Many thanks to all of the vendors 
who donated prizes, Gregs VW being the number one contributor. 
Wolfsburg West and Mark Adair were two more that donated. It's very 
kind to donate to the raffle. But, the GG Chapter really should have 
tried to get more prizes. They were charging double for their raffle 
tickets what SV2s charges at Familienfest. Maybe I'm biased, but I 
dare anyone to say that was even close to the quality of the typical 
FF raffle. After the show, we (SV2s) had a potluck dinner that 
included a FREE raffle and that one BLEW away the previous raffle 
that people actually PAID for! (Thanks again to Mark Adair for 
donating to our free raffle!)

Ok...enough whining. I was glad to meet more listees...Robert Davis 
(Hey JP, I delivered the tank!) and Larry &amp; Ellie (Thanks for having 
a secret birthday dinner with me). It was also good seeing all the 
usual suspects. Next time, I'll go for the camping and shmoozing, but 
my bus will be outside.

These opinions are mine, not those of the club as a whole, btw.
