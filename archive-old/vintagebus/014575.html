&lt;&lt; why would you have to take it apart and go through it? &gt;&gt;
Hi Pete,
Well you do not have to take it apart, but if you want to trust and get the 
best HP, longevity, and MPG then taking it apart is a good idea.  After all 
the volks in Mexico are not going to balance the pistons, and connecting rods 
down to the point that there is no differance.  Plus they are not going to 
polish and blue print the heads, and oil system.  So while it would probably 
run, if you are looking for as close to perfection as possible you are the 
only one who can make sure of that.
  We know of an instance up here that a little old lady who only drove very 
short distances for about 30,000 miles had her original dual port engine from 
Germany lock up when she decided to visit a friend up the highway.  Turned 
out that the oil cooler looked like it had neve had oil in it and the dog 
house stand had not been drill through at all causing this.
  We have found oil passages to the cam sections of German dual part cases to 
not have been completely drilled through causing flow resitriction.  Also 
recently heard of a fellow listy who got a Mexican engine and could not start 
it.  Turned out that the rocker arm assemblies were sitting loose inside of 
the valve covers. 
   Even when we bought our last long block from Bear's we found that the new 
Brazilian heads had casting flash blocking up almost all of the cooling fins 
near where the exaust ports are.  We took a circular saw and a used carbide 
blade to clean out this flash in under five minutes.  We feel that the guys 
at Bear's are more likely to check things and do it right than the volks in 
Mexico, and still this got by.  Jose in Mexico getting paid a dollar or less 
at the VW factory is probably not going to be worried about quality as much 
as the folks at Bear's and thusly the Mexican engines are not going to be 
quite as good.    Eric&amp;Barb
