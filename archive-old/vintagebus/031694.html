In the caravan from Christmas tree island to OCTO in June out off 50 or so
BUSES in the busavan over half had CB's.
  Most people that I know that DRIVE there buses on road trips and in
caravans all have CB'S. The person leading, at least one in the middle and
always at the end. That way if someone is having problems or just to chit
chat, there always in comunication.

Subject: [VB] Who has a CB?


I am wondering how many people run CBs in their busses to communicate while
caravaning to events?

I have one sitting on the shelf and would like to know if it is worth
putting in the bus....  Also where do you put the antenna?

The CB in my truck has been great, so if you all use them I will install
mine.

Thanks,
