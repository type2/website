&gt; My real question is can I get better mileage from this setup (carb and

Did you bolt the carb on out of the box or has it been jetted for a 1600
correctly?

those weber progressives are notorious for needing a lot of jetting work 
to get em set up, but once set up i hear they are great carbs...

take care,

Steve

p.s. just because teh store said it was set up for a 1600, dont trust em.
