Subject: Missouri Bus Fallout is on for Nov 16,17,&amp;18 2001

Hi all,

The Third annual Missouri bus fallout is coming up in a couple of months
yet again. Last year we had great weather, but, this year who knows...

Details can be found at:

	 http://westfailure_dot_net/fallout.php

Since fall camping isn't for everyone I have decided to shift the focus
from being a bus oriented event to being an event for all VW owners and
admirers. Bring your vw, or if you can't, come in what runs, just be
prepared to have people talking to you about VW's all weekend ;)

There are no planned activities or event fees, just $3 per night camping
or so if you split a site with another veeduber. Electric sites are
available.  Showers will not be, they close the running water restrooms in
October.


Thank you,

Stephen White
President, Missouri Micros: NEATO chapter.

P.S. I have forwarded this only to the lists I am subscribed to, if you
know of any other VW oriented lists where people might like to attend, I
would be very appreciative if you could pass this on. (Eurovan &amp; Vanagon
lists come to mind)
