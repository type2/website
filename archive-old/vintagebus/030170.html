Subject: Re: [VB] safari wiper shaft restoration.

I repro'd the internal safari wiper shafts.  These are almost identical
to the originals with one exception, they're made of 321 stainless
steel.  I spent almost a year building tooling to produce these, but to
date have only sold about 250 sets.

&gt; Out of curiosity, are the ones you have the later external repro ones, are
&gt; you talking about actually rebuilt earlier (internal) ones (65-67 style you
&gt; need for the buses with the wiper frame assembly, though also usable on the
&gt; earlier buses)??
