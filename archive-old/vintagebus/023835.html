Subject: Re: Rarity of 1956 Non-sunroof Deluxe?

I may be wrong (again) on this one, but I thought I had heard or read
somewhere that you actually had to pay MORE if you DIDN'T want a
sunroof. Maybe because they made most all of the deluxes with sunroof.
Again, I've been wrong before. Can anybody shoot this one down or
confirm it?

Mike
