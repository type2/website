Subject: RE: [VB] friday question - coffee names

how about:
&quot;12V Conversion&quot; for the regular brew, the one that
just perks you up a bit.
&quot;Freeway Flier&quot;  for the extra dark, large sized
coffee, the one that gets you going a bit faster.
&quot;Fridolin&quot; since it was such a hodge-podge of various
type VW parts, this could be for the mix of various
beans for that special, slightly unusual flavor.
&quot;Oil Change&quot; for the double brewed, triple espresso,
chewy, mud type coffee. (I'll take 3!)

[...]What I need from the
&gt; list is this, I need 4
&gt; names
&gt; for blends of coffee.  I would like to keep them VW
&gt; related, they do not
&gt; have
&gt; to be all bus related.  The 4 lucky winners will
&gt; each get a pound of fresh
&gt; roasted coffee with their blend name.  Thanks all,
&gt; come see me at Volksfest
&gt; in
&gt; September!!!!
