Subject: fender flares no more!!!
Message-ID: &lt;Pine.GHP.4.21.0007312033380.27044-100000_at_raptor.csrv.uidaho_dot_edu&gt;


Started hackin' off the UGLY fender flares on the old '57 bus.  Got the
front two off and found the original doglegs under them
(SCORE!)...except...rust on the passenger side one (BUMMER!).  So I
spent all day Saturday cuttin' out the rusty metal and welding in the new
metal (The only way to fix rust!).  While I was in the bodywork mood I
decided to start fixing the nose where I got backed into months ago.  I
still need to find correct rear wheelwells before I cut the back fender
flares off...so if anyone has some good '57 rear wheelwell panels drop me
a line.
