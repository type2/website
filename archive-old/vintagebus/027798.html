Subject: bumper seals?

I finally got the bumpers painted and they really look nice.  They will
match my nice shinny bus :).  My question:  is it worth putting any type
of rubber seal between the overriders and the blade on the front and
rear bumper.  Does anybody have experience with using some type of seal
or just leaving it metal on metal?  I realize that VW shipped the
bumpers out of the factory with out any seals but the rust between my
overriders and the blade was pretty bad.  Thanks.
