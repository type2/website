Subject: Re: [VB] GL4

Sure its been said before in archives.

GL-4 is for transimissions which contain yellow metals
such as brass ect.  If you read the side of the
Sta-lube large gallon containers of GL-4 I buy at my
local NAPA, it even states &quot;...for use in
transmissions containing yellow metals.&quot; 

Oils such as Gl-5,6, and up contain certain additives
(that gl-4 does NOT) that are corrosive to yellow
metals and should not be used in VWs which contain
yellow metals.

Check out later VW owners manuals...I have seen ones
that state these facts in similar wordings.

I have used GL-5 and up oils many many times years ago
before the GL-4 ONLY requirement was brought to my
attention.  I had no ill effects but honestly never
kept any of these buses over probably a year or so
period...thus who knows what could happen down the
road.

I hear the yellow metals in the VW tranny is in the
sycros and thus where the probs arrise first.

Anyhow...read the posts.._dot_educate your self and make
the best decision &quot;you&quot; belive best for you.

Todd
