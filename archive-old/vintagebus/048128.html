&lt;&lt;  Sorry to but in, but I didn't know that you could have a 15 gallon fuel 
tank in a bus.  My 67 had a 10.5 originally I believe, and my replacement was 
an aftermarket that only held 10.  Man, a 15 gallon would be nice.  &gt;&gt;

Hi JD,
Yup, you can by installing a 15 gallon 1968-71 bus tank with the neck cut off 
of a pre-1968 bus tank, hose and hose clamped onto the late tank.  Dent the 
rear bottom of the late model tank to allow for that body sheet metal hump 
over the tranny bell housing  (This denting is not needed for installation in 
trucks!).  Extend the early tank mounting straps.  Plug the late model 
venting tube on top of the tank or install a complete fuel vapor recovery 
system.  It helps to weld a tighter bend in the pre-1968 tank neck and bend 
the late model inlet slightly downward to meet the hose from the modified 
early tank neck.  We have done this to our 1960 panel camper conversion and 
63 SC.  Sure is nice to have about 300-375 mile tank range instead of at most 
250 miles.   Eric&amp;Barb
