Subject: emergency brake problem

Hey guys,

just made it cross country in my new 1971 squareback...as nice as it is, I
missed my bus. Upon returning I tried to take my bus for a ride the next
day(today). It had sat for about 10 days, in wet raining weather. When I
went to release the emergency brake-it wsa very stiff, as though it were not
really releasing. And my brakes feel really soft...so I didn't drive very
far, basically about 5 feet, then back into the parking spot.

I have noticed in the past at times, that the brakes seemed to feel as
thought they kind of stuck to the drums...I am guess that is what has
happened. Althought it has never happened this bad before, and it used to
loosen up almost immediately before. I imagine I need to try to pull the
rear drums to see what is going on back there...but before I do that, I
thought I would ask you all to see if you had any insight...it is also
raining here still so I am not anxious to work in the rain.

I left the bus in gear now, instead of with the emergency brake on-I usually
leave it in neutral with the emergency brake on.

Thanks

as for trip reports I guess I can post it tomorrow(friday) even though it
was not in a bus....;)
