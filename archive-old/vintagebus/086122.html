&gt; Eric &amp;barb you suggestd putting a zerk fitting on the clutch pedal assembly.
&gt; Ive never put one in before, any suggestions on how you install one? And
&gt; the best place to locate it for this assembly?

I have installed two different types of zerk fittings. None of them at 
the clutch pedal assembly, but in other applications. Basically the 
first step in both is to dissemble the part. The next is drill a hole 
where you want to install the zerk. The third step depends on what sort 
of zerk you have. Some allow you to use a small holder and just hammer 
it into the hole. Others require you to tap the hole and then the zerk 
threads into them. HTH
