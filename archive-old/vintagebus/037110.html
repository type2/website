I'm looking to find out the compatibility of shifter parts on my 58.

I took out the old screeching front shift rod support that had no bushing.

It has a smaller hole for the rod and a spring on the  support that pushes

down on the rod.  I replaced it with the newer type support and found that I

had no reverse.

did you try greasing the moving parts?  My 59 has the same set up with the
metal tab on the support, and it does not screetch.   It was somewhat greasey
when I got it but I gave it more grease.  hey just jack it up, grease the
front suspension, and use the old grease that comes out to grease all the
moving parts on the pedal  and brake stuff.  Older style brake cables have
grease points too, and the older (63 and back) tie rods and drag link, and
some of the shift rod tubes even.  Grease it all!!!!!   Grease is good.  I
like grease, and so do VW s. 

Oh, the lock out plates are interchangable- so that should be great.  It is a
good idea to dump the old worn ones.   But all the stuff where the shift stick
is in the ball and socket joint and around the shift plate should be greased.
Did you put the new shift plaet in correctly?  Although reverse is back and to
the left, the reverse portion on the plate should be forward and to the right,
as it does a reverse mirror image thing at the pivoting point.   (meaning when
you pull the shift stick back, it pulls the shift linkage forward)

I haven't interchanged shift parts, and some will not interchange.  I'd put
the original shifting stuff back in with the new shift plate and grease.
But then again I guess I'm a vintage pervert.

......... Looking at it, the shifter was not able to come down far

enough under the lockout plate.  I got the newer larger style lockout plate

and still the same thing.  If I loosen up the two bolts it will go into

reverse fine.  I thought hey, I could just leave it like that.:)  My

solution is to put washer(s) in between the shift support and the underside

of the floorpan possibly giving some more room to get under the lockout

plate.  Any comments?   The parts I am dealing with:

Original 58 shifter (small ball and socket?)

Original 58 lever retainer and spring.

Original 58 front shift rod.

Newer style lockout plate

New shift rod support and new bushing.



Am I missing some part I am unaware of?  The Bentley (the 64-67 one)

mentioned something about changing shift plates when changing the shift

support, so I did that.  The old shift plate was kind of chewed up some

anyway.
