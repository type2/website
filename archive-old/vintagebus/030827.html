Subject: No leg room!   (long)

Well, its midnight and I finally finished one more thing on the pre trip
&quot;to finish&quot; list.  I finally installed the correct seat and brackets
back into my '62 crew cab.  Someone along the way had installed a later
1/3rd / 2/3rd front bench with brackets (thankfully pop riveted them in
too).

I figured that the correct front bench would not only look correct, but
since the seat I bought had better padding and upholstery than the other
seat, it would be more comfy too.  Well, so much for comfort!  After
hours and hours of drilling, cutting, patching, hammering and spot
welding, I now have at least two inches LESS leg room.  Now for someone
with normal appendages this would be no big deal.  For me however
(mostly legs), this is a huge deal.  The upright leg to pedal position
is even more pronounced  ....I feel like a marionette on strings.

Lest you think that I installed the brackets in the wrong place, the PO
politely did not primer over the old bracket spots so I had a perfect
reference for where to weld my newly acquired brackets ( thanks to the
listee who helped me out with these!! Sorry I forgot your name).  These
are the two year only 3 position brackets, though I think the only
person that might have been able to use the two forward positions would
have been the late Billy Barty!

I guess the seat could be overstuffed forcing me farther forward, but
as far as where the seat sits, it is dead on. At least I can now get the
spare back in its well.  The only other bummer is that I have to move or
take out one of Robert Davis's famed cup holders, as my left knee has
absolutely no room with it installed.

On a bright note, I now have an automatic headlight turn off feature.
When I exit, my right knee automatically pushes in the light switch
:-)   Ahh, the price we pay for correctness.  Stupid I know!  The long
drive to RB will be the test.  If I get there and don't get
out.....you'll know why.  Please come over and pry me out and hand me a
beer ;-)  Thank you.

On to the next task on the list.

Steve
