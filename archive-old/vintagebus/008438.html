The Heaters / Coolers category in the Iowa Boys online RV parts catalog has
several very compact direct discharge heaters/furnaces that draw low amps
and crank out gobs of BTUs.  Most need a standard RV 4&quot; outside vent
stack/cap, much the same as on furnace-equipped Vanagons, etc..

Go to:

    http://www.iowaboys_dot_com/partscatalog2.html

and follow the links.

I'd be interested in hearing from anyone that has a similar heater in their
VW.

They also carry a line of catalytic heaters.

This outfit has a bunch of stuff applicable to VW buses, including a 12V
Evaporative Cooler.  It's a bit pricey, but it's a mighty slick looking
swamp cooler...

The heater for which you sent the link is commonly used on work and pleasure
boats in the Pac. NW.  There are also versions that use diesel fuel.

FWIW.....

&gt;&gt;  What do you think of this device...

It looks like it might well work in a bus...

Any input appreciated..  &lt;&lt;
