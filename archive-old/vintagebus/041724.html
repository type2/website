Ive been using Kendall 20-50 for at least a year. I was told that there
was some thought that it would run cooler. Well I dont know if its any
cooler than other oil but has been good in temps from 40s to mid 90s. My
oil
temp has been ~210-215 max so far this summer and Im sure I could do a
little better job with the engine compartment sealing and engine tins.
