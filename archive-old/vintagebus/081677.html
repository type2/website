Subject: Re: [VB] re:tires

Chris,
Will it stow uninflated? You'll have to carry a compressor and put up with extra time to inflate it. Might be worth it. Porsche 924 had an inflatable spare, but I've never seen a compressor in any salvage yard.

 -Harry

 Looks like I will need to find something else to use for a spare 
&gt; as these are too wide for the spare tire well behind my 2/3 front seat. 
&gt; Anyone want to purchase an unused previously owned tire? 
&gt;
