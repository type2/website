&gt; My 65 is sitting waiting for paint and it has twice had a problem.  The

&gt; the fuel pump and it is not punctured or leaking.  So, is my metering valve
&gt; stuck open and the carb and continuing to fill up an run over?

I had this happen once on a bug.  The float valve weeped fuel and one time
when the bug sat idle for a month or so the crankcase filled with gas.
When I restarted it it blew out the front seal and made a heck of a mess
on my driveway.

Another possiblity is a bad diaphragm in the fuel pump, but I think you
have already discounted that.
