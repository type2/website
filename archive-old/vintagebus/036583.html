it all started saturday, left havasu at 12 o'clock to
go to yucca AZ. to pick up my new double cab, got lost trying to find
the place out in the desert again, it all looks the same, 1 dirt road
after another.  Finally found the right road and the desert dweller who
had the double cab.  After swapping the rear tires and moving the
trailer around got it loaded, pay for it and get the title , off we
went. forgot
to mention got the truck rear bumper with it also! and a bunch of extra
stuff that i haven't sorted out yet.  
Then it was on to get the other
single wheel trailer i found, this one has an aluminum body on it, got
the
trailer, upon loading it in my truck i pulled my back, OUCH, that laid
me up
for the rest of the day then woke up sunday morning and decided that
since i still have the trailer mite as well take off to YUCCA&lt; CAL. to
pick up
the 66 hardtop walkthrough deluxe that i bought before thanksgiving, 
so after 7 hrs. of driving, a really sore back and an aching stomach
from
no food i made it back home, 2 new buses in the yard and now a lot more
work for me to do, photos of both will be up soon.
