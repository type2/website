Well if you mean last October, yes it did break down. Of course that ignores
a couple of coast to coast trips since then pulling busses both ways. Be
nice to Britt and Road Cow they are just about the biggest hearted team you
are likely to find. You never know when it will be your turn to need help
and you can be sure we will all need help at some time.

I hope this doesn't start a flame but isn't that the
same road cow that blew up the last time it was out
and about? (sacramento?)It just might be time to put
that old girl out to pasture!
