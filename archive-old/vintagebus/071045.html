Subject: Re: [VB] Oregon Questions

Volk-a-maniacs,

Ahh Oregon... My home since birth.  I grew up on the semi-'dry' side as
David puts it (Bend area on HWY 97... Sean).  Then I moved to the wet side
(Willamette valley) for college.  Then moved the the northern 'wet' side for
work (Hillsboro - 13 miles West of Portland).

Some stats:
I paid $1.54 9/10  per gallon to fill up Annie today with non-super.
There are numerous groups that get together for bus stuff.
There are several shows within 50 miles from here.
    - Emery's VW and Porche farm in Amity
    - Woodburn Raceway - Races, bug-in and swap
    - Portland International Racewar - more of the same
    - Not within 50 miles, but more like 150 is Puyallup
    - And several more that I intend to find this summer
I know of at least three VW only shops (mechanic &amp; parts) within a few
miles.
It rains a lot, but eveything is green 300+ days a year!!!  :o)
We have a coastline Highway that is one of the most beautiful drives anyone
could dream of.
Following the river by Portland toward the 'dry' side of the state, the
Gorge is arguably just as beautiful of a drive.

Sure, rust is a part of life, but we don't salt our roads too much here,
good maintainance is all you need.

Come on by, were nice folk.
Greg
'63 Sundial 'Annie'
Bunch of other stuff

P.S.  Did I forget to meantion the BEER?  We have a lot of brew houses and
excellent beer.  Anyone like Black Butte Porter from the Deschutes Brewery?
That is located in Bend (central Oregon).  It is best from the tap at the
brewery.  In moderation of course.   :-)
