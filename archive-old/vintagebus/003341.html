&gt; I have rusty phillips screw heads holding in my louvered
&gt; camper windows. The problem? Removal. So far I have dulled 2
&gt; HSS drill bits  within seconds and also a tungsten carbide
&gt; tipped drill in about 10 seconds. Whats the best alternative
&gt; for removal since the screw driver doesn't do it. Should I
&gt; use a die grinder and a small wheel? Or is there another way
&gt; to drill? The rust seems to be extremely agressive.
&gt;

Most carbide tipped drills are for masonry, not metal. It is possible that
you had one that is intended for metal cutting, but I don't recall ever
seeing any that small. Solid carbide and cobalt drills are well suited to
drilling tough materials, but the solid carbide are very brittle for use in
a hand drill. Be sure to get your drills from an industrial jobber, the
drills available from general hardware stores are not the best
available.There are other possibilities for removing the screws. Since the
jalousie window frames are aluminum, you could place a small nut (1/4 in.)
over the head of the screw, weld through the hole in the nut to the screw
head, allow to cool  a little (the residual heat helps free it), then use a
wrench on the nut. A die grinder with a counter-sink carbide burr (82 deg.)
is another possibility. Assuming these are Phillips head screws, you should
have no trouble starting in the middle, the hard part is stopping soon
enough.
