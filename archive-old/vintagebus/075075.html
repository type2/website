Subject: RE: [VB] costco canopy tarps-where can you buy them ?

  Being they are now obsolete, I still have a NOS one in the boxes, should
be worth a few hundred by now, obsolete, NOS, original boxes sounds like a
VW part now!!

I've found from another source that these are NLA.
I'm told to try http://www.northerntool_dot_com or maybe
direct from Cozmo (800 929 9517)

Damn - and I sold mine a while back for $100
