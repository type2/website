&gt;Who's got all the middle seats?
&gt;
Most of them are in my underground bunker.  I found that by creating a 58=

degree F, 75% humidity compartment where the seats are misted with glycer=
in
twice per day, the original upholstery returns to like-new condition with=
in
2-3 weeks.

If you wish to see the results, I will have a 1957 Microbus seat, green
in color, available for viewing at this Saturday's NEATO/OCTO meet in Sou=
thern
California.  Interested parties will be able to sit on it, provided they
are clean and disease-free.  Medical records required.
