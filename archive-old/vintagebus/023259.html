9 auctions have ended

5 with no bids
1 with bids that didn't meet the reserve
3 with bids that met the reserve or there wasn't a reserve

No feedback from sellers yet.  I've had a few discussions with various
people about the format of the auction itself.  Some people are aprehensive
about the sealed-bid concept, and others have concerns about the high-bid
wins all concept.  Still too early to call, but depending on general
consensus, I might switch to a proxy format (still with sealed bids) or let
the seller choose when they list the item.  I'm sticking to the sealed bid
concept because that single element eliminates a huge percentage of the
problems with a certain other auction site.

I've also had a few suggestions to call the site &quot;V-Bay&quot; and &quot;VW-Bay&quot; -
whadday think?
