&lt;&lt;  The upper drivers side shock support has rusted out and looking at the 
front end that I plan to use has some serial numbers stamped on it. Are these 
numbers just vin. numbers or something else? The front end is the King Link 
type and has the numbers 768528.&gt;&gt;
That is the ID number for your front end.  In other words if you went out to 
your bus one morning to find your front end having beeen stolen you could 
look for that number to catch a thief!

&lt;&lt; Also any recommendations to sandblasting the front end clean and 
repainting it while she is out prior to the swap.&gt;&gt;
Best for suspensions is to have it sandblasted, powder coated with high zinc 
primer and 80% gloss semi gloss black.  Three years of hard driving and all 
of our brake backing plates still look brand new!    Eric&amp;Barb
