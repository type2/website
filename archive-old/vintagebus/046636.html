&lt;&lt; Hi there,
 
 Speaking of manifolds and crabs, is there such a thing as a single-port,
 dual carb setup?  Would it be worth it?  I'm thinking of putting dual carbs
 in my '67 (eventually), but don't want to go to dual-port with this engine
 (1600 with c/w crankshaft and torque cam).  I'll build me a monster later if
 need be...I just want strong reliability for now!
  &gt;&gt;
...................
yes, I have seen, and even driven single port with dual carbs.  Such a thing 
came on a 65 21 window w H case 1500 i had for a bit.  the linkages were 
pretty worn and sloppy, but it still performed.   Don't have a source for 
these?  swap meet?  ebay?  :)  Is it worth it?  I dunno
