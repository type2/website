Subject: I need Help

I have a 65 deluxe that I am stripping down to restore and have a 
couple questions. I need to replace the cargo doors, I have another 
pair but they are not from a deluxe therefor no pop out hinges. Is 
there anywhere i can find them, or do I have to get my old ones off 
and use them? The bus has plenty of rust and I am having trouble with 
the front cargo doors bottom hinge, it just wont break loose. I need 
to replace the strip that you bend over to hold the headliner in the 
sunroof opening will i have to make this? Anybody ever use any of 
these rust neutralizers? I have alot of surface rust and i want to 
make sure it does not come back. I need most  normal body panels if 
anyone has any you dont need e-mail me 
with what you have. I am getting ready to order all of the panels I 
need in the next couple of weeks so any help would be appreciated.
            thanks,
            Dave Parsons
