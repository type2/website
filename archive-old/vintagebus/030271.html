&gt; Late night TV news showed footage from SoCal relating
&gt; to the amount of rainfall on Thursday. Same storm is
&gt; supposed to hit the Phoenix Metro area before daybreak
&gt; Friday.
&gt;
&gt; Footage showed a white small window splittie flooded
&gt; above the rockers while sitting in the lower level of
&gt; a public parking garage. Does it happen to belong to a
&gt; listee? Hopefully not...

That was not mine, but that rain storm found a few spots in my window seals that
leaked.  We got 2.5&quot; of rain in just a matter of a few hours.  Got in the bus
this morning to find the valve covers that I had left of the floor containing
about a quarter cup of water each.  And this is a bus that had been previously
leak free.  I think it was hit by so much water that it might as well have been
submerged.

On related note, I dozed off early and then woke up about 12:15am just as the
main part of the storm hit.  I noticed that my sump pump in the patio was not
keeping up with the downpour.  Ended up spending the next 30 minutes during the
heavy part of the rain, in my jeans, T-shirt, bare feet and 40 degree weather,
sweeping the water off the patio into the pool to keep it from flooding my
family room.  I was rewarded for my effort by just the smallest amount of water
leaking into the room instead of the full on flood like we had back in
November.  Took me a while to warm up after all that.

This crazy weather is driving me nuts.  I had 4 days of outside bus work planned
before I have to go back to work on Tuesday.  So much for those plans.  The gas
heater will have to wait.
