Subject: Re: [VB] Brake wheel cylinder paste...

&gt; Hi all,
&gt;
&gt; I'm in the throes of rebuilding a few 4-5 year old wheel ATE cylinders
&gt; and all looks real nice.  So I go to find a tube of brake wheel cylinder
&gt; paste to use for re-assembly of the cylinders and of course I can't find
&gt; any!  Is the stuff still available at a local parts house anymore?  I
&gt; know this is the world of just install a new one and hurl the old one in
&gt; the garbage, but these are in nice condition and are easily
&gt; rebuildable.  Bosch used to make the stuff in a tube, but a few local
&gt; joints that I've called already just don't stock the stuff.  Any ideas?

Well, the stuff exists:

And here's a Porsche place that carries it:

Warm of that visa card!  Pricy stuff!

George
