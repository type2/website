Subject: Re: [VB] Bar and Chain Oil

I think tar is what VW used to undercoat new cars in the 60's. How do I
know? I used to do it as a summer job at the local VW dealer. If it wasn't
tar, it sure smelled and and felt like it!

Reminds me of the old bug I had bought that was completely undercoated
with tar. Talk about a fire hazard, you should have seen the run spots
along the area where the heat exchangers were!


&gt; Anyone have any ideas on bar and chain oil as an undercoating?

Yuck! Oil will just grab dust and dirt and hold it on your chassis. Try
POR15.
