Subject: Coming to Phoenix!

If you can get a copy of &quot;Original VW Bus&quot; by Laurence Meredith  go to page 10.
There you will see a Jan 30 1951 orginal Microbus owned by Peter Valentin--As of
today it now has a new home in Phoenix, AriDzona.  This is bus # 9301. I'm told
this Microbus is among the earliest known transporters surviving in unrestored
condition.
At the 1995 Bad Camberg I had the opportunity to drive this bus--and it is
featured on my 1995 Bad Camberg Video--If you have the video, check it out--
&quot;AB 51&quot; which is the license plate number, and as it is known in Germany, comes
with a 30hp motor, and a &quot;Freeway Flyer&quot;? full crash, non-synchro tranny.
Interior has a cloth headliner, in near perfect original condition, and all the
seats. My thanks to Peter Valentin.  uj
