Okay volks - here's tonight's progress report.

The Sapphire works great.  I ran it tonight for the entire time I was in the
shop (about 4 hours) and heard a neat old Fibber McGee and Molly radio
program from the &quot;When Radio was King&quot; program.  It was all too much - I
damn near had to sit down - it was like living in a time warp. :-)

Moving right along, I decided to see what I could do about mounting a new
speaker in the bus as the paper in the old one was non-existant (or should
have been.)  The speaker I was using to listen with is out of a Pioneer boom
box that my dad yoinked from someone's trash years ago.  Since this speaker
was smaller, I decided to grind out the center portion of the existing bus
speaker (which I did.) Then I simly fit my new speaker inside the framework
of the old one and held it together with 4 wire ties. Now I have a speaker
that mounts in the stock location without having to drill new holes and run
mounting brackets and all.

Next was the removal of the wiper assembly which was no problem.  Using info
from the www.acvwjyro_dot_com page, I tried and tried to fit in a wiper assembly
setup from a baywindow bus and I don't see how it can be done with denting
the underside of the dash or leaving the radio out.  I went so far as to
flop the wiper output shaft tubes to orient them like the splittle ones are
and still, no go.  Well during all this hub bub, I needed some parts from
the basement and when I got down there, here laid a split window bus
assembly that I had incorrectly identified as being for a baywindow.  This
was good and to top it all off, I'm sure it's a 12v motor as the vw part#
match.  The VW part number for a 12v motor is:  211-955-113G which is
repeated on each of the 3 motors I have.  The 6v equivalent is:
211-955-111Q

So yes, I totally rebuilt the wiper assembly - looks great and 100% cleaned.

Monkeying with wipers suck but at least is the last major thing under the
dask that needed fixing..Later!
