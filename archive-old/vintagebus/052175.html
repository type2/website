     Being rather thirty (okay cheap) when I had my safaris in my '57 single 
cab, I did not have safari wiper shafts.  I found that I could reach the ball 
and socket on the stock wiper shafts and pop them loose so I could fold down 
the wipers.  The thing I liked about this was I could go full flaps in a 
matter of seconds, and never leave the drivers seat.
                                                               Peace,
                                                                   FWT
