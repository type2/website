hey,
i was watching the Indians game last night and they kept showing this 
commercial for carb/fuel injection cleaner. does this stuff do anything, or 
should i take the $4 and buy lunch with it. WITHOUT CARB ADJUSTMENT, has 
anyone ever noticed any improvements after using any of this crap? smoother 
idle, better mileage, cleaning jets???
just a thought,
BOB
