No Quarter,

Not a bad idea that you have, but it is not as simple as that. I've been
out of electronics for awhile now, but if I'm not mistaken, the only way
you can get 6v from a resistor is if whatever you happen to be running
is the same resistance as the resistor you're running, and both are
wired in series. In other words, if all you are running is a radio, then
you have to run a resistance equal to the that of the radio. If you have
other appliances you want to run, you will need resistors to go with
them, too. One won't work, because the voltage drop will change
everytime you turn one thing on or another thing off. Another thing to
consider is that a resistor does draw power. It changes the electric
energy to thermal energy (heat). One of those damned laws of
thermodynamics...
