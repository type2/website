&gt; &gt; Hey, John, with all those newly opened up manifolds we
&gt; &gt; did the other day, let's just cut the top off one and
&gt; &gt; weld on the appropriate flange as a test!
&gt; Hey JP,
&gt; Actually my one that had a cracked heat riser would be good.  The problem
&gt; is opening up the tubes to a bigger size and the SP bends don't come up as
&gt; high to meet the DP manifold.

My feeling is that the major restriction in the manifold is at the &quot;tee&quot;
below the carb.  The back-and-forth nature of the vacuum signal cannot do
much for flow with the sharp transition here.  Since the runners end up at
the head with a fixed hole size (unless you really want to mod things),
the runners themselves shouldn't have to get much bigger.
