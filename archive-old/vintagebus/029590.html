&gt; Wow- i'm impresed, I had thought about doing something like this with the
&gt; first split I had, but never had the nerve.  Also I dont have teh artistic
&gt; ability.

Well, I have two close friends who are great illustrators and I plan to
bribe them into helping.  Nice thing about Maxx's stuff is it's
generally pretty blocky, lots of solids -- fairly easy to map out and
just paint-by-numbers if I can find a design I like.  I'm gonna locate
some good line drawings of bus front and side, then play around with
Photoshop.

&gt; You can always repaint it.  if you want.   My 65 westy was (ick) metallic
&gt; blue outside, and house painted brown with a brush inside when I got it. (ick)

I briefly considered and quickly abandoned the idea of brush strokes all
over that nice clean, straight surface.

&gt; Just do the prep work before paint to keep the metal sealed away from the
&gt; weather.

Amen!  That's the idea.  Of course, by the time I get it all prepped I
may just decide to go stock -- we'll see.
