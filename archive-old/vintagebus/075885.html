&gt; There's plenty of white gunk inside the ports and also on the externals of 
&gt; the heads.
&gt; How can I clean this off?
&gt; How likely is it to have damaged the heads?
&gt; I'd like to salvage these ones.

Hi Andy,
Probably the best way is to have them soda blasted.  You can instead just 
polish the cylinder seating area with sand paper and inspect the area for pitting 
which is your worst enemy right now.  No deep or many pits then you can run 
them as is.
