Adrian,

In the early 70's, I tried to use PVC plastic pipe on my 65 bus.  As Craig 
already suggested, it could not take the heat.  The pieces sagged to the 
point where one end came lose and then they started falling off at 55 MPH and 
bouncing around in front of other cars as you watched in your rear view 
mirror.  That being said, PVC has come a long way since the 70's.  They now 
make PVC that will vent high efficiency furnaces from houses (no need for a 
chimney anymore).  I wonder how this would work, because it has to handle the 
heat from these furnaces.  Anyone on the list tried this type of PVC?  You 
guys in Georgia or Aridzona may have trouble finding this stuff so let me 
know if a guy from the northeast can help.
