got my 66 hardtop deluxe home and started to survey
the stolen items, i have most of the parts i need
to complete this original low mileage X church bus
but lack a few and am looking to the list for some help

1.  drivers side deluxe molding
2.  side window jail bars and 6 ends
3.  radio block off plate  ( beige/white)
     or a radio to fill hole (they stole radio and left the knobs)
4.  backrest for rear seat and any associated hardware
5. and the ever elusive middle seat ( seat stolen, but all clamps left)
6.  last but not least 1 14&quot; beauty ring (and they didn't steal the rest)

i have found/or have all the other missing pieces as i would like to
put this bus back to original, unrestored state, it deserves it.

this bus is extremely straight, 4 small dents in entire body, the titian
red/lower
paint is faded to primer except for the rear which looks like it was
repainted
but shows no indication of any damage.

this bus has been parked since 1977 when a rod knock was heard
will try to start original engine (owner said has never been  removed) to
see what
the problem might have been. still has govner, all tin, even pulley nut
guard
pre heat tube, valve adj decal, etc., looks way cool complete and all

the headliner is as new (sort of unbelievable) but it has sat for 23 years

if i get running in the next week, i  will drive it to whitman/vw show

need to sell some buses, so the famous swap panel and maybe
my 66 walkthrough westy will need to go in order to keep this deluxe
or it will have to go,  business expansion forces the need for a cash
influx.
so something has to go!
