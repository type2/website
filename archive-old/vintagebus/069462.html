Subject: Type lV motor problem

I have a 77 Type II with a 2.L Fuel-injected motor that I recently rebuilt.
After installing the motor, it idles fine, but when pushing on the
accelerator, the motor slowly dies.  I'm fairly confident that I put
everything back correctly, however, there is that &quot;one thing&quot; that I might not
have paid attention to.  Has anyone else had this problem in the past?
(Please tell me I'm not alone!)  I have faithfully read through my Bentley,
Chilton, Haynes, and &quot;Idiot Guide&quot; for advice and information.  I'm sure the
solution is going to be &quot;simple&quot; (as in &quot;right before my eyes&quot;) but go ahead
and make me feel stupid anyway, as long as you provide the answer for me.
Thanks guys (and gals). Steve
