It can be bought, but it will have a &quot;salvaged&quot; title and will need a full
brake and lamp certification before it can be re-registered...

&gt;Not to wear out this subject - hopefully this is another tangent on the same
&gt;theme - that vw wrecking yard single cab I have a question about.  I was told
&gt;that in California wrecking yards usually don't have used car dealer's
&gt;licenses, therefore can't sell used cars.  Once the car is taken to the yard,
&gt;it doesn't come out.  Isn't there a loophole there?  Can't you buy the
body as
&gt;a &quot;part&quot;?  Or can't it be sold as a piece of scrap?  As far as I know you
&gt;don't have to have a scrap license to buy scrap.  If there is, wouldn't the
&gt;first option work?  Isn't there any other loopholes/options that the wrecking
&gt;yard owner/attendent would go along with that I haven't thought of?
&gt;
&gt;As far as title, all you would need is a bill of sale for something that old
&gt;and you can get it titled in Georgia.  Other states are the same way.
&gt;
&gt;Just a thought.
