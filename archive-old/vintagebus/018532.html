The screws are hidden under the outside rubber seal.  There will be two
at each seam.  If your frames are OG, unmolested, it will take you a 
second to find the seams.

Getting the screws out is probably the most difficult element of popout
restoration.

&gt; elighten this newbie.  I had almost thought frame restoration to specialized 
&gt; for me with frame soldering or the like but it is sounding very doable 
&gt; according to this.  Thanks to the brave soul who answers.
