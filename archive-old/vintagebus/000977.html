Wow,  I'd love to see the page on ambulance fan install... or could you tell
me where they suggest placing the ground and where to hook up the positive.
(I know, others have said to put the positive on the wiper switch + side and
ground on the panel... I'm just curious)

BTW, check out http://www.nedcc_dot_org/ for info on restoring old books, maps,
etc.


Much thanks if you can read this page.

David

Hi list, I recently acquired a VW Service binder with Technical
Bulletins for 1958. There are many Transporter updates, such as Speed
Governers, Rear shift rod protection, Pop-out installs, the new
&quot;re-inforced&quot; bumpers, radio install, ambulance fan install and more.
The only problem is, this book got wet, and alot of the pages are stuck
together, and have mold. Could I &quot;re-wet&quot; the pages to separate? and
then hang to dry?
 If I can salvage these bulletins, I will be sure to scan, and make a
page for all to see! I also picked up a '58 Ghia manual, but that one is
near mint.....

TIA,
Michael
