Hmm...most of this stuff, the PO put there...some of it is mine.

Screws and washers for the LH front trim panel (around the headlight)
Fuse box cover
One dome lamp lens
Wiper arm
Safety flare
Two old gas receipts
One old license sticker receipt
8a fuse
Top of an inline fuse holder
Change
Psuedo-church-key; actually a J bolt with the threaded end filed 
  to a square taper
Church key holder

Other Friday stuff...I saw &quot;Almost Famous&quot; last weekend and yes,
the first half or so of the movie is crawling with Buses.  The movie
is set from around 1972-1976 or so, so there are some bay-windows,
but there are also lots of splits.  Even a single-cab and a double-cab
here and there.  The split that goes to the party in Topeka is (I
think) a '66 or '67 as it looks to have backup lights when it pulls
into the front yard.  The Greyhound-ish bus is the band's tour bus,
which the record company (briefly) persuades them to forsake in
favor of an airplane (so they can play more shows).  The airplane...
doesn't work out.  :)

On the topic of remote car disabling...this probably works in one
of two ways.  I know that some of the proposed OBD standards (not
OBD-II, but I think OBD-III or later) include a &quot;phone home&quot;
mechanism for your engine computer...when the check engine light
comes on, it transmits the fact that it came on, any codes, and
maybe your VIN, probably over the cell network, to the Correct
Persons.  The Correct Person may be the dealer who bugs you to
bring it in for service, or the DMV who sends you a nasty-gram
about getting your smog equipment fixed.  Given that you have
the &quot;call out&quot; capability, it would be reasonably easy to extend
this to include a &quot;call in&quot; capability that would allow the
Correct Persons to cut off your fuel remotely.  This scares me,
because I am sure that the remote-cutoff capability is advertised
as being &quot;encrypted with a code that can NEVER be broken.&quot;  NEVER
always turns out to be a lot sooner than they think for these
kinds of things, so imagine the fun on the highways when you
can buy a box out of the back of Popular Mechanics for $100 that
can shut down any nearby car.

The other way wouldn't require built-in support in the car
computer.  I think some companies have been working on disablers
that are essentially powerful, directional radio transmitters.
By aiming a powerful burst of RF at your car, they hope to
overload the electronics with spurious signals to the point
that the fuel delivery is affected and your car stalls or at
least slows down.  However, there's nothing that says your ABS
computer won't decide to lock up one wheel while you're flying
down the road at 70, either...

I don't think the bad guys will be running away in Buses,
but I think the smarter bad guys will try to use cars with
points ignition and as few electronics as possible if they
contemplate running from the law.  (BTW, I didn't know that
the Supremes had further lowered the standards on search...)

Relevant Bus Content:  Finally got out to *the* VW junkyard
in town and got a Rabbit MC reservoir, so the brake conversion
should get going this weekend!!
