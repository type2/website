Subject: [VB] We've got a VW show in Virginia, too!

It's called BugOut #53 and it's tomorrow, May 25, in Manassas VA, 
starting at 9am.  If you're anywhere within a couple hours drive of 
northern Virginia, better come on by--this is (unfortunately) the 
biggest VW show in the mid-Atlantic region (outside of Pennsylvania).  I 
say 'unfortunately' because I can usually expect to see only 8-10 
aircooled Type 2s there (mostly campers), and maybe three of them 
(including me) will be splitties.

Oh, well, at least I'll have a chance to check out the swaps.  Hope it 
doesn't rain again this year or that will scare a lot of the sellers 
away like last year.

Show info is at http://www.gti16v_dot_org/man1sho.htm#man1sho.
