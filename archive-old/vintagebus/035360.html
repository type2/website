Clara &amp; I have gotten back from 2 weeks in Germany and three days at Hessisch 
Oldendorf.
I have 20 megs of pictures from my digital camera that I will be putting up 
on my site, but will edit a version for busaholics.
It was awesome! So many early beetles and variants such as Rometch's etc.
Buses were not as plentiful but several Barndoor ambulances and 2 hearses.
Only three singlecabs and no double cabs.
We also went to the VW museum &amp; the Autostadt in Wolfsburg, with some pretty 
amazing VW stuff.
Will post a webpage from work via the T1 line this afternoon.
