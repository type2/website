was writ:
&quot;How can there be hundreds of list members and I only see 10-20 regular
responders to questions?&quot;

well, heres how i see it. personally i am not comfortable giving someone
advice about a fix unless i am SURE i know what im talking about OR i can
speak from personal experience, like if something has worked for me. but
their seems to be four kinds of people on this list.

there are people on this list who are very knowledgable and respond to every
inquiry; thom, eric, clara, etc... you know who. (regardless if you like
their responses or not :-) the bus guru's.

then there are people who sit and wait for someone to respond, and then all
they do is say how wrong that person was. WTF! where was their response if
they are sooo smart. they are on this list just to stir up the pot.

then there are the guys that have to tell us about every time they fart in
their bus. these guys LIVE for aircolled VWs... which is cool, i like to
read stories and stuff.

then , there are people that arent bus einstein's and are here to enlighten
themselves and take in as much as they can. this is where i fall. i can do
just about anything to fix my bus, but start talking R&amp;P's and see ya later.

but overall, this list has gotten very spiteful over the last three years i
have been on it. almost not worth sifting through all the emails every day.
im not whining, just giving you my opinion.

now dont reply to me, i dont care what you have to say, im just callin it
like i see it. no big thing.

later,
