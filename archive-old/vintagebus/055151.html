Subject: Re: [VB] Sunroof Barndoor Kombi special?

Here's my two cents.
Four grand for that is way too much. Not too long ago
there was a decent barndoor on the samba for 7k that
was way more complete and restorable. I would love a
brandoor but they are pretty expensive. have you
priced a 23 window lately? How about a middle seat?
Ambulance fan?ect ect ect

&gt; show this past weekend. He 
&gt; seems to think it's gold.
&gt; Considering all it's missing is $4000 anything but
&gt; outrageous? or are pre 55 
&gt; type 2's that much more valuable that post 55?
