Hi Jerry&amp;Mellisa,
Could be worn RGB gear/s, but doubt it.  Could be 
worn/missmatched/missmachined fourth gear set.  R&amp;P should sound whiney in 
all gears if aligned incorrectly.  Drain oil and see if and where chunks of 
metal come out as big as pin heads or bigger which is a good sign of damage.
