I tried a bit of an experiment last weekend.  Turns out that it's
pretty easy to convert a fresh air heat muffler into a stale air heat
muffler.  The only difference that I can see is that you have the air
ducts wrapped around the exhaust manifolds.  Those are held on by a
bunch of bent-over tabs, and one small spot-weld.  Bending the tabs
back is fairly straight-forward, and the weld snaps off after four or
five flappings of the housing.  The resulting muffler fitted up just
fine.  This was, of course, a 40hp muffler to start with.

One slightly disappointing discovery was that there was no primer
under the air ducts, and so there was a moderate amount of surface
rust.  Something to keep in mind for you folks that use fresh air
heat....
