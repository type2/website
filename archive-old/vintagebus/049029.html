Always a good time, always a good opportunity to see loads of buses and always provides a chance to see old faces and new.

I finally met Dawn of the PLF fame, which was a treat.  And to think she got hammered by so many people, it really rips me now after meeting her.  Shame on all of you!!!  Fortunately she was keeping good company with Richard, aka Rustybus.  Both are great folk that I'm glad to know.  I picked up a new canvas tent pole bag from Dawn, so if you need one get ahold of Dawn.

Hooked up with Kyle.  He was hard to find.  It's not like he was driving a stretch split window bus or anything.  Also met Matt, of Matt &amp; Katie.  I gotta think Matt is getting tired of hearing &quot;Oh you're Matt, of Matt and Katie.&quot;  I've got to admit I said it.  Sorry Matt.

Also saw listee Greg Noble, aka Frankiehill.   No Greg, I still haven't decided on the bed slats.

Most of the same buses as usual.  Lenny's '52(?) Barney was nice, but looks better in the pics on the Internet.  Still a nice bus.

Picked up a few cool accessories, not too many deals tho.  Afterall it is L.A. so what do you expect.

Robert
