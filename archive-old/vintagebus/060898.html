&gt; The only problem I see with moving the fuel line to

&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt;   For bus travelers/non anal retentives, I have
&gt; &gt; found the best way to route
&gt; &gt; &gt; the fuel line in to drill another hole through the
&gt; &gt; drivers side bulkhead,
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; This looks good to me.  I've been planning on doing
&gt; &gt; that to my 67 as it
&gt; &gt; will now need an electic fuel pump anyway.  I might
&gt; &gt; like it enough to
&gt; &gt; convert the others.
