 HELP! I have 3 days to get the cargo doors off of my '67 and I am at a loss
 on how to do it. I removed the little plastic cap/screw and I can not figure
 out what is holding the pin inside the hinge. Someone told me there is a
 screw but I do not anything but allot of crud. I tried digging the crud out,
 but I still do not see a screw down in there. Do I need a special tool?
 Suggestions, comments, advice?
  &gt;&gt;
pin?  hinge?

get a big head phillips screw driver, better yet one that goes on an impact 
driver.

the plastic plugs in the door jambs- about 1 in  dia, remove those- there are 
two big screws per hinge or 4/door.    yes they can be a bear.  dont tweak 
the screw or you get to drill them out :(
