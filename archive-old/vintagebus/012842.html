Dude;

Did you replace the rubber lines?  That's the most common cause of binding:
the wheel cylinder doesn't have enough oomph to overcome the
restriction in a bad line, but the pedal can still squeeze the fluid in,
so it becomes a on-way valve.  A brake diode, if you will.

Also check to make sure the master cylinder rod isn't too long, but if
you haven't dorked with it, then it probbaly doesn't need dorking.
