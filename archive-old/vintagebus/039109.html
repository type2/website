Hello,

I'm a new subscriber with a '79 bus in search of advice.  

The seal on the rear hatch is leaky and brittle.  I need a new one.  The
Bow-Wow shop wants $135.  Is this a fair price?

I've done some internet research looking for on-line ordering but I haven't
had much luck.  If anybody knows any good websites or places to order the
rubber please help me out.  The shop has to order it anyway so I've got
time.

Thanks in advance,

Joe 
Seattle
