Hi Eric,

Didn't realize that was Barb with you, should have introduced myself.
Tristan was with me, my girlfriend.  Funny that we both pulled up to Todd's
at the same time, but Todd (written) instructions had said his house was on
the left, leaving us a bit confused when you pulled up to his house :)

Got a kick out of &quot;40HP please pass&quot; spray painted on the back of your bus
:)  Who needs a damn bumper sticker.

I haven't had much problem with brake fade, but I'm still learning brakes.
I've gone back and forth with myself about upgrading the rear -- but opted
not to.  At this point I'm trying to get the stock in good working order
before I opt to upgrade.

The bushing I'm talking about is the center steering ... I have two or three
inches of play when I turn my steering wheel.  Clara told me the tie-rods
looked new.  I presume I'm talking the same procedure that Thom just posted
pictures about on his '55?

Hi Steven,
LOL when we read this upon getting back to Barb's dad's place.  Had to take
his blood sugar level before dinner so we were in a rush when we saw you.
Good looking double cab and it was good to meet you even briefly!  

&lt;cut&gt;

What rebushing?  Just the center pin and or the king and links?  Would
highly
reccomend instead to install a 1964-67 bus front suspension it has 20%
bigger
brakes and they feel more like 50%.  We installed on both front and rear
suspension of this kind in our 1960.  Made a real improvement in stopping
and
now does not have the brake fade problems which it had even when the lightly
loaded on steep hills in and out of Seattle.  We even installed only a front
1964-67 suspension in a friends 1959 DD panel.  She noticed a big differance
immeadiately after when she moved to New Mexico.  She was very happy that we
had made the suggestion to do the change.
