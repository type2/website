&lt;&lt; I am prepping my Boston Bob 1600 DP long block with a 66-67 1500 SP oil 
bath 
 air cleaner (the hung from engine compartment ceiling type).  So I am 
looking 
 over where to connect the preheat tube for the air cleaner.  Looks like I 
 have 3 options:
 
 OPTION 1: 1 inch tube connected to 211 129 511 (A) - This is the metal tube 
 which bolts to some part of the exhasut system to draw air off of or near 
 head #2 or #4 (I have never seen it).  Clara mentioned in the archive that 
if 
 you don't have the metal tube one can wedge the paper hose between the push 
 rod tubes.  I could do that or make a tube if someone had a picture.  This 
 setup routes the preheat up through the rear (fif) engine apron tin.
------------------------
no, not between the push rod tubes, but  between the tubes and the tin under 
them.
======================
 
 OPTION 2: 1 inch tube connected to heat exchanger - I was looking over the 
 stock 1500 H block I pulled the air cleaner from (from a 1967 bus) and 
 noticed that it had the setup where the preheat tube went through the front 
 vertical engine tin and connected directly to the heat exchanger near 
 cylinder #1.  
---------------
I think this was what they did on 67s.  you have to have that kind of heat 
exchanger and the front tin with the hole in it (or cut a hole)
=========================================
 
 OPTION 3: 2&quot; tube to cylinder air - This would be similar to the 68-71 bus 
 and 70-74 bettle.  There is a larger metal tube with a flared wider intake 
 that takes air from behind the cylinders.  I guess the concept here was to 
 have more air (bigger tube) but from a cooler spot (cylinders, not heads or 
 heat exchanger).  I would have to modify my air cleaner with a 2&quot; opening 
for 
------------------------------
you could try to find the smaller pickup tube that was used on 67 and 
earliers.  there is a right and a left depending on which side it goes on, 
and the rear tin to match with hole on right or left or both.  I think using 
the big pickup COULD work,   Duct tape?
 ===============================
 I guess I am tending toward option #2 (heat exchanger takeoff) since that is 
 how this air cleaner was set up when used on an engine (1500 SP) that most 
 closely matches mine (1600 DP).

whatever works is good.  If you feel like changing the HEs, go for it.
