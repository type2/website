&gt; &gt;If you're not planning on running high RPMs, you don't need these.&lt;
&gt; 
&gt; Without a tach it's REAL EASY to float the valves before you grab your next
&gt; gear, especially first.

In that case, you are planning to run high RPMs and should go for the
high-$ stuff.  Most drivers don't float the valves.
 
&gt; &gt;If you aren't running high RPMs and the requisite stiff valve springs, the
&gt; stock shaft/rocker/adjuster will do fine.
&gt; 
&gt; After 30 years of work hardening and wear, those clips have a tendency to
&gt; break. Happened to me twice on the same engine.

Never had it happen myself.  It might be prudent to go to new parts, but
why go to high-$ race parts when you aren't stressing them beyond stock
levels?

&gt; Stock springs just barely
&gt; cut the mustard for a bus

The only function that valve springs have is to return the valves to a
closed position after they are opened.  They must be strong enough to keep
the  the lifter in contact with the cam while the valve is closing.  At
high RPMs, the spring has to be stronger as the valve must close faster,
which is why race engines run stronger valve springs.  VW designed the
stock valve springs to provide sufficient force to close the valves at
normal RPM levels.

&gt; and HD singles aren't going to kill your drive train.

One disadvantage of using stronger valve springs is increased wear on the
valve train.  That extra force on the cam lobe will cause increased wear
and more energy will be used up in operating the valve train.  There is no
reason to increase pressure unless you are building a specialized race
engine.

&gt; Solid rockers are a snap to put together; ratio rockers are a
&gt; different animal and from what I hear, need a little more attention to
&gt; setup.

Stock rockers go together easily as well.

&gt; &gt;It's a religious argument, but the stock points are pretty darned reliable and
&gt; don't tend to die in unfixable ways like the electronic gizmos.&lt;
&gt; 
&gt; Nothing says fun like filing/adjusting a set of points every month and
&gt; having your timing go out when the block wears down.

What are you doing to your points?  I check my dwell and timing every oil
change, because it's convenient to check them at those times.  A dab of
distributor grease goes on the cam while the cap is off.  If the dwell or
timing is out of spec I adjust it, but that happens only about once a
year.  I change the points every 5 years whether they need it or not! :)

OTOH, I put a Pertronix Ignitor points replacement on a non-VW a few years
ago and it worked fine.  At least it did until it stranded me by dying
just as if I had turned off the key.  Dead as a doornail and no chance of
fiddling it back to life.  Luckily, I was only a few blocks from home, not
on a long trip or in a traffic situation.  If I had been on a long trip,
the hassle involved in recreating the points ignition system would have
wasted a lot more time than the typical minute I spend checking the timing
and dwell every 2000 miles.  I've never had a points ignition fail without
warning like that Pertronix.

&gt; I've had my electronic
&gt; gizmo in place for five years with no problems. Set it and forget it. Keep a
&gt; set of points in your tool box if/when the gizmo breaks.

I keep a complete distributor in the parts box, but have never had to put
it on.

&gt; &gt;The HP-1 filter is a good idea unless you make provisions for a pressure
&gt; bipass.&lt;
&gt; 
&gt; Full flow is always a good idea and not just for race engines. I'm not
&gt; running a pressure bypass cover. Someday I'll probably get one. I change my
&gt; oil to a thinner weight in winter and haven't popped a filter because of it.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;Myself, I just change oil at reasonable intervals.&lt;
&gt; 
&gt; Changing the oil often won't stop those chunks from getting past that screen
&gt; door in your sump and into the bearings.

True.
 
&gt; Like I said in my original post, whatever tickles your fancy. If your bus is
&gt; a beauty queen, then by all means, keep it absolutely stock. I offered
&gt; suggestions based on my experience because if you get a wild hair up your
&gt; butt for dual carbs, (like I did) your drive train will be prepared for it.
&gt; That's the great feature about this list, nobody can agree on any one thing
&gt; and it's like a buffet, just pick and choose what looks good.

I come from a philosophy of defining what it is you want to accomplish
before you start.  Running race parts without good reason can have
negative effects on reliability, as I explained above, and can be bad for
one's pocketbook.  The VW magazines provide plenty of hype in this
direction and I try to be a moderating voice.  You'll note that I'm not a
total stock nazi, since I happily run an alternator and late bay discs and
calipers.

The VW engineers worked very hard to make a 1600cc engine that could
produce full rated power continuously and reliably in a bus.  That engine
can be tweaked to produce more power for a short time, but getting more
power continuously is _very_ difficult with the stock cooling system.
When confronted with the need for increased power the VW engineers built
an entirely new type 4 engine for the task.  

You _can_ get away with a large bore type 1 engine in a light car (VW do
Brasil did exactly that with a 1700 type 1 in their sports car) but you
only get away with it because you do not use full power for extended
periods as you do in a bus.
