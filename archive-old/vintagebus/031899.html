Jan &amp; I went to bugorama from Cupertino,
 We left around noon on Saturday and arrived at the raceway/campsite about 5 
having checked out antique shops in Stockton.
On arrival I tried valiantly to put up my new bay window westy tent to look 
like the picture on the beach in the brochure (  
http://members.xoom_dot_com/sglw/westybrochure  )  page 3. The ground was like 
cement and I did not have a hammer to bang in the tent pegs, but with a 
little bit of effort everything came together really well.

The strange thing was seeing the number of westy tents. I counted at least 5 
and they were all like in the brochure and 3 of them were used with 
splitties. The side that attaches to the bus has a sort of pocket, so that 
the sliding door fits away.

I took a few PICS and they will be up on my website and I will post when they 
are up.

BTW I saw Thom's vintage bus &amp; westy so I assume that the acrimonious 
postings are all over and everything is peachy keen.

BTW2 Does anyone have recommendations for a mildew/waterproofer that I can do 
my new/old rent with.

63 westy
