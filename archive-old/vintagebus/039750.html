Alright, well I'm finally putting the steering wheel shaft back together and 
through the hole in the floor.  Heh, that leads me to a question.  I really 
don't remember how I took the beast out.  Do I just need to jack the front 
end up REALLY high and slide it in?
Anyway, I need the seal that goes from the floor to the shaft.  Do these 
exist...because Wolfsburg West guy told me they don't.  Where should I go 
then?!
Thanks as always,
