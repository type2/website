Subject: Yosemite campout DEAL!

Well, here is your last chance! Taylor Nelson cannot make the trip and I will be canceling his reservation at 11am this morning. The reservation is for July 11 to the 16th in Yosemite National Park. Last year we had 40 buses in the North Pines campground, it was great.
 
The price is $75.00 for 5 days, which is actually cheaper than what everyone else paid ($18 a night). Each site will hold two buses and a max of 6 people per site, dogs are OK as long as they never leave a 6 foot leash. First come first serve!!
 
There are caravans forming; one Bay Area group, and another coming up from from So Cal so you are not alone!
 
SV2's would like to see you there!
