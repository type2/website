Subject: Re: [VB] Daily Driver Poll/Bus Sighting :p

Shows the rural lightweight I am I guess :)

&gt;Aw, heck, I drive my stock '71 bus in the SoCal environment all the time.
&gt;Stay in the right lane, speed around 58-62 and never have a problem.
&gt;
&gt;Lots of vehicles do the same thing, including most of the trucks.
&gt;Remember that the truck speed limit in California is 55 still, so most of
&gt;them run 60-62 if they want to avoid conversations with John Law, so buses
&gt;fit right in.
&gt;
&gt;I suppose I could feel peer pressure to go faster, but I enjoy my bus too
&gt;much to shorten the trip!  Just because someone else is driving 90 is no
&gt;reason that I have to as well.

&gt;&gt;  &gt;Hate to say it, but the vintagebus_dot_com panel has been relegated to
&gt;&gt;  &gt;backup, show, and Home Depot duty.   It's just not competitive in
&gt;&gt;  &gt;this region's traffic environment.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;  The ONE time I went to California for D*sney, OCTO, The Classic, we
&gt;&gt;  took the modern mini-van. All I kept telling my wife was &quot;How the
&gt;&gt;  F*CK do they drive a VW Bus on these highways!&quot;. The Highways I was
&gt;&gt;  on in California were absolutely the worst roads I've ever driven on.
&gt;&gt;  Seems like there's so much traffic they don't have a chance to fix
&gt;&gt;  'em. People doin 90 on horribly torn up bumpy &quot;highways&quot;.
