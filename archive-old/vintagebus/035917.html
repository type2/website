&lt;&lt; Anyone have any luck using their AAA plan to move a project car around, ie
 bring one home from a shop? &gt;&gt;

When I knew I was going up to buy a single cab, I checked where the hundred 
mile point was and when the tow truck driver got there I asked him to drop it 
at this gas station on the side of the freeway while we followed him. He 
dropped it and then I called AAA again after eating and had it towed the rest 
of the way home, I don't think the drivers care if you tip them.
