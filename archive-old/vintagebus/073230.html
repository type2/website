&gt; I'm buying a rebuilt trans from Rancho today via one of my local

&gt; My question:
&gt; 
&gt; Will it fit right? My old one is the original 6volt,
&gt; &quot;professionally&quot; clearanced for 12volt.

When I bought mine from Ronnie he asked about gearing as well as the
6v/12v issue. Mine went in my 66 w/ no problems.

&gt; Since all they sell are rebuilt 12volts, I assume the trans I'm
&gt; getting will be from a 67-71 bus.

it shouldn't be from a post 67 bus. the tranny changed from the splits
to the bays. the RGB went away. Make sure you are getting a swing
axle tranny.

&gt; Are they all the same? Will the linkages to my gearshift lever all jive?

my rebuild did not have the nose cone with it (but ronnie already told
me that) so I pulled it off the old one and put it on the new one. if
it is the correct tranny it should work just fine.
