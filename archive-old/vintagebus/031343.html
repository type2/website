Subject: RE: [VB] Holy dirt batbus

&lt;&lt;I've said it before and I'll say it again... it sounds like a lot of
work
but I actually enjoyed the work once I convinced myself to start.  It
was
fascinating to look at the workmanship, the weld splatters, the drip
patterns in the old primer, etc. etc. etc.  Just take your time and have

fun! :-)&gt;&gt;

I agree! It is enjoyable but only in small doses. I can only do a couple
of hours at a time. Would love to spend a whole day or two under there
and get it over with, but my tolerance just aint that high. It is great
though, watching everything turn to white and to see how much brighter
it is under the bus. It looks so clean!
