WOOHOO! Looks like its time for another Dust-Up on Vintage Bus!!
Dang, it's been quiet for almost 2 weeks now... I was actually LEARNING
things from recent posts, yeeesh. :P


In other news, I am testing various aircleaners on the 70 to see their
effect on mileage/accelleration, etc. The stock bus cleaner seems to make
the carb (30pict1) run a tad rich compared to  a 36hp bug one I have on
there now; I am steeling myself to put one O those big chrome ones on - but
I'm gonna have to paint it black first!
