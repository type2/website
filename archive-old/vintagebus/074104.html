Subject: Re: [VB] dual battery wiring

My westy (also a '66) has the dual battery system, using a marine dual 
battery switch. A quick google search yielded this result:

http://store.wardmarine_dot_com/Merchant2/merchant.mv?Screen=CTGY&amp;Store_Code=WMOS&amp;
Category_Code=BS

And that first switch is what I have. It has 4 positions: off, battery 1, 
batt 2, and both. That allows charging for both while driving, and using battery 
2 at camp, so #1 is not drained. Hooking up is straight forward. I used a 6 
feet long cable to connect battery 2 to the switch and ziptied the cable to the 
gastank cage. Battery 2 sits opposite to 1 in the engine compartment. Add a 
ground strap and secure battery 2, and it's done.

Beto came up with the idea at first. I stole it.
