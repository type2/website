Have just been browsing the great photos from Kelley Park on various 
sites, and was particularly interested in this one from Everett's site:

http://www.thesamba_dot_com/vw/gallery/8497.jpg

It shows the Plexiglass corner windows in a restored '53 deluxe (which 
looks lovely!) Those corner windows look mint - are they brand new?? 
The ones I've seen always seem to have alot of surface stress crazing 
and lines on them after nearly 50 years of life, and the optical 
properties suffer due to this. Has anyone tried to polish Plexiglass 
corner windows to remove this (perspex polish is available).......and 
does it work? 

Thanks for any insight.
