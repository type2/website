Fellow listee Steve Harris and I blazzed up to Kelley Park Sunday
morning from Orange County.  I had never been to the show, but it was
well worth it.  The park is very nice (Even in the rain) and there was a
great turnout.  Steve and I thought the rain would keep folks away, but
by 8 there was a line almost 2 block long.  Since we were VW less
(tranportation wise), we walked in and starting looking around right
away.  The part swap area was really good.  Lot's of stuff that you do
not see in LA/OC.  Both of us scored some parts.  I was hoping to find
my still elusive 2/3 middle seat and Steve was looking for Westy parts.
We both struck out.  I did get some interior do-dads.  Lot's of bus's,
both restored and not.  Best on i saw (That i had not seen befor) was a
59/61 double door panel van walkthru.  Someone spent alot of time
restoring it and it showed.

Not a VW part, but someone had a Whizzer motor kit for sale there.  No
idea if it was all there, but boy was i dreaming.  That would be a fun
project.  The $800 price tag woke me up preaty quick and all i could do
was look at it.  Oh well, someday. (Like i need another project)

Saw Thom's Westy (did not see him though) and talked with Clara for a
while.  Say lot's of folks from OC and lot's i had never seen.  It is
good to get out of OC for show's every once and while.  (You actually
find parts you need from people other then dealers.  Refreshing)
Otherwise, we looked around and tried to stay warm and dry.  We left
about 11:30 and good thing we did.  It rained all the way home and was
snowing over the Grapevine.  Had we left any later, i do not think we
would have made it.

Overall, long drive, but well worth it.  I think i will have to make a
weekend out of it next time.
