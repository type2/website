Subject: Re: &lt;FMBC&gt; HCBF pix request

I sent Dave my pictures.

While we are on the subject, did anyone get any pictures of Team Jablonski
at the family feud? I wish the rest of my family had been there to see that!
Thanks guys.

Subject: &lt;FMBC&gt; HCBF pix request


&gt; During HCBF a few friends and I got together for a fighter
&gt; practise.  Towards the end, we did what we call &quot;whack a knight&quot;, where we
&gt; let kids take their best shots at us.  I know a few of you good folks took
&gt; pictures of that as well.  Could you please forward me copies so I
&gt; can  send them on?
&gt;
&gt; Thank you all very much
