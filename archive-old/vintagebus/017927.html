I suppose it depends on what your normal travel patterns are.  I'm
either driving locally, or doing long trips.  On long trips, I pretty
much fuel up at every opportunity (which usually works out to about
3/4 of a tank).  For local driving, reserve is about twice the
distance across town.  So, if I fill up ASAP after switching to
reserve, the only window of opportunity for the emergency scenario is
while I'm driving to the petrol station (i.e., traffic accident and
someone with flashy lights'll be doing the driving), or while I'm at
the petrol station (probably not much need for anyone to do any
driving in that case).

Obviously, this assumes a certain amount of forethought being used
(I'm going a non-trivial distance, fill the tank).  Anyone that cares
so little about potential problems to not take that elementary a
precaution definitely should not be driving a vintage VW....
