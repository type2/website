Subject: Stubborn bolts.....
Message-ID: &lt;378B9FDE.D145E661_at_ansbach_dot_netsurf_dot_de&gt;

Ok here is the delemia. On my 65 delux I can seem to get any of the
bolts loose on the door hinges or the bolts that hold the window frame
to the door. The bolts want to strip but there not there yet. Any good
ideas on how to get these stubborn bolts moving? If they do strip what
do I have to do to fix the problem?  I sprayed WD 40 at them and that
didn't help either.
Thanks in advance for any responses.
Bryan
