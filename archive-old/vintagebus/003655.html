Brad mused, &quot;Should I just put it back together and hope?&quot;


I an not a good enough mechanic to advise you either way but if you wanna
put it back together and try to start it........

You might wanna turn it by hand first with the plugs out so there is no
compression. Listen carefully and feel for any resistance.

If you are feeling good about the hand turning then try and crank it with
the HT wire off the coil(if the plugs are in) so that the engine spins by
starter only. At least this way  no combustion will occur and if is starts
to get funky there will not be a lot of torque or heat.

If that goes well make an offering to the bus gods and give it a try with
the plugs in and the coil hooked up. Be ready to stop the engine quickly and
make sure you wallet is full of $100 bills just in case.
