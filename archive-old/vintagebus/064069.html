Subject: Rot in front beam

Started stripping the front beam that I was intending to restore today.
Noticed a very small hole in the bottom of the upright pieces.  It is on the
inside at the very bottom of the thin metal on the inner part of the beam  -
looks like a small puncture that has been left unattended.  Poked about and
the bad stuff  is about the size of a quarter.  Inside the free area now
accessible from the hole there was lots of black grimy stuff - not sure
whether this should be there or not.
I am in the UK and there aren't too many beams around so I am not sure whether
to repair this hole or to give up now and try to get another beam.  Should
there be black stuff in the free area or is this built up road grime -
possibly causing the whole end to be rotten?
Any ideas?

Thanks
Paul
