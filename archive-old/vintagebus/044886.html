&gt;  Eric and Barb,
&gt;  Don't have a part number, this is all WW had in there catalog
&gt;  TURN SIGNAL FLASHER UNIT, 6V, for cars with emergency flashers, 1965-1966 
&gt; Bug, 
&gt;  1965 Bus
&gt;      Price: 
&gt;                  $130.00
&gt;  

seems a lot for that bit.   It was also used in the other buses with the BRL 
on the dash, not just 65.   dont know about bugs.  The 65 does not use the 9 
pin version.   I might have a couple spares laying around I would sell for $2 
(plus $25 S&amp;H) (just kidding) or I can dig up a part number and you can look 
at swap meets and pick one up for a buck or two.  I am talking about the E 
flasher bit here

it does use a regular flasher relay for the turn signal though.   You know 
the cheap 3 prong kind.
