Jay,

I can understand your concerns with a heater and living up north.  But that
is where the late model advantage ends.(Unless you like plastic)  I got my
first split about 4-5 yrs ago, so I am by no means an old timer, but I drive
EVERYWHERE in my bus.  Some say I am a little nutty, but what can you
do....I say drive it.  Right now I drive a 63' Panel, with a bent up rusted
roof rack from my first split I got in an accident with.  It's not the best
thing on the road, but I got style!
You would also have to be somewhat mechanically proficcient, or at least
want to be proficient.  More than once I have been stranded, but nothing I
didn't see coming.

In short, if you want a car you can kick around a bit more, than go get
yourself a watercooled.  If you like the idea of making every drive an
adventure, the split is for you.

&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Is a split window bus a reliable daily driver...say between about 1963 -
&gt; 1967? I have a chance to buy a 1981 deluxe camper ($2000) that needs a
&gt; tranny ($1500 new w/clutch if needed), and I like it but what I
&gt; really want
&gt; is a split window camper. However, I live in Wisconsin and would I be
&gt; happier with the later model bus in the long run (it has a working gas
&gt; heater)? I hope this email does not annoy the other listees and is an
&gt; appropriate post. I guess I want to hear the selling points of the split
&gt; window vs. anything later and why you drive a split. Finally,
&gt; would it make
&gt; the most sense to buy the later model mentioned earlier to use daily AND a
&gt; split-window for Sunday use/(restoration).
