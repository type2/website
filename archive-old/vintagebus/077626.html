if you get bad noises out of your RGBox bearings, do investigate them and replace what's bad, or this could happen to you.

I know of another set that got trashed, from basically keeping on driving after the bearing made horrible noises.  A total of two in my experience.

 Very sturdy, but not indestructible.  

Then again, I know of many more crankcases with rods stuck through them, or cranks or cams that broke.
