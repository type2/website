Subject: VW dealers 1950's

Hey all,
       Does anybody out there have a year by year listing of VW dealerships 
for the 1950's?  I believe VW would give a dealer directory with new 
cars/buses.  I am also interested in dealer badges and license plate frames. 
  I have about thirty VW/Porsche license frames.  I'd be interested in 
trading or outright purchasing these historical items. They make great 
garage wall decorations. Thanks in advance.
