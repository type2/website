Dont know why, but this message bounced from the quantum.digital
address, so I'll try straight old Type2_dot_com. maybe it was because of the
Toyota content....

List:

After some last minute discussion as to whether anyone form our local
club (VWWO) was going to make it to the show and swap at Woodburn
Dragstrip,
only 40-some miles away, I decided to run the asian water-buffalo truck
up and hand out some flyers. Ty and Janelle and the Wileys all had prior
commitments, and we needed someone to get the word out about our
upcoming event! I am driving the Toyota these days because Kelli is
living temporarily in the bus at her job down south. I do miss the bus.

        The alarm rang at 6:45 and I was up and into a Bug Werks T-shirt
and
shorts and out the door before I realized how cold it was outside. I
decided it would warm up, and I drove the Toyota over to my storage area
to pick up some junk to get rid of. 
        I loaded two core engines, a 36hp darren Wiley gave me and a
40hp that
jeff Lepikko left when he split to the east. Boat anchors both. Also
took my never set of 15&quot; bus rims I haul to every show, a 2/3 section of
a split bus front seat, a nifty bug trailer hitch, and a bunch of header
exhausts and intake manifolds, and a gas tank, free to good home.  
        Got to Wooodburn at watercooled speeds, paid the $15 to get in (
ouch!)
and parked in a swap spot. Ashley from Always Vee Dub in Portland saw me
and started in immediately on the non-VW I was driving. Later I noticed
that he had driven his ford truck.  Saw Frank AKA Mr.Bubblehead, and VW
Al ( in his santa-clause jumpsuit) and Joe Locicero ( of type4 upright
conversion fame), all members of Good Times VW, and Rose City Volksters,
the show's sponsors. Frank drove his bay camper, Al his 23 window
(conspiciously not for sale at this event) and Joe brought the
engine-blow motor, a tri-port ( one single and one dual port head)
installed in a crusty old bug. 
        Aside from the usual load of good stuff and garbage, there was a
troubling amount of watercooled paraphanelia, and even a few
watercoolers entered in the show. Is this the future? But then there was
also the likes of Chris Seeger from L-5 Vee Dub, with a really nice
early non-oval bug and many good parts and good deals. The show had many
nice buses, including a very nice 23 window at stock height! Also
perenial swap-meet vendors Pakratz Toys were out, and at one point lost
their mammoth tent to the strong winds. 
        Club member Bob Stalick was there in his 56 oval, &quot;Bob's Burnt
Bug&quot; and
I will be suprized if he didn't win a trophy ( I left before the
judging). Gerald, recent new club member was there as well, but I was
embarrassed to admit that I didn't recognize him at fisrt. 
I managed to give away or sell nearly everything I brought. Eric E (of
Eric and Barb) showed up in a Bay Window with a buddy from Olympia, and
he got the 40hp and his friend got the trailer hitch. I sold the 36 to
some kids from Portland who sounded like they had the means to rebuild
it, or at least could use the parts. I had several dune-buggy type guys
looking at the motors and asking &quot;Is those 1500's or 1600's?&quot;. Even had
some hippy character from California try to trade me some of his rusty
NOS $50 bus emblems for the 36hp, but it was a no-go.
        Rick Crandall and his daughter Jessica showed up late morning,
and
passed out flyers to sell their very nice 62 rag-top bug. Jessica even
passed out some of the many flyers for the Jurassic I brought along.
After I sold some stuff I had a beer, or close to it, anyways, as all
they had was Budweiser. Rick and I then left Jess in charge of the parts
and scoped out the vendors. Good deals we saw: Bus 40hpp dirty air
exhaust, $35; Electric sump heaters, NOS in box, $5; Lotsa gas heaters,
between $75 and $125. Big Foot was there from Portland with a decent 66 
kombi for $950, and also a slammed crewcab for $1850(?), and there was a
cool doubledoor 63 panel for way too much money at $4500.  Rick bought a
gas cap for his 73 thing, and wonder of wonders, I went the whole swap
without buying a single thing, save only for the glass of Bud.
        When the stuff was mostly gone, ( all but the 15&quot;ers and my 2/3
seat)
we rounded up Jessica and said bye to half a dozen folks, and hit the
highway, Rick and Jess in front in the 62 bug, and me trying not to run
them over in the Ter-yota. We stopped at the Tom-Tom in Albany for
german sausage melts all around, and Jessica gave me her fries! 
        All in all a decent swap-meet trip. But I do wish I had my bus!
