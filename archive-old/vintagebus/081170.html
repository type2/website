Subject: Chamfer

Michael asks:
&lt;&lt; ***** chamfer *****
I know this is spelled correctly. How do you pronounce it. &gt;&gt;

I pronounce it, and have always heard it with a hard -ch-
as in -chill- and -am- as in &quot;I am going to the store&quot;,
followed by a -fer-, like the end of -transfer- 
not to be confused with -for-.

Never heard it as if there were an -n- in the word.

Those are the sounds.

Two syllables, cham-fer

I spent a lot of years working around machine shops
where the machinists actually create chamfers and
actually talk about them, and the engineers that
specify them, and the manufacturing engineers that
define how to produce them in detail to the shop
(that was my job).
