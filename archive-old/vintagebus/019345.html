Subject: &quot;Foyer&quot; tent roof brackets - mounting location measurements?

Hi volks -

I'm wondering if someone with a 65-67 westy with roof brackets for the tent could measure their location and send it to me.  I'm talking about the brackets that 
would be roughly lined up with the leading and trailing edges of the cargo-door opening, and a few inches up from the gutter:

I'd like to get the &quot;factory&quot; locations even though I'm sure I could guesstimate close enough.  Simplest measurement would be: Y inches up from floor of gutter to 
bottom edge of bracket, and X inches forward or back of door opening to leading edge of bracket (one Y and two X measurements)

Thanks!
