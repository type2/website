Hi George,
Thanks for the reminder!  Duh!  After any pressure washing of the front 
suspension do make sure to jack up the front end of the bus till the front 
wheels are just off the ground and grease ALL the zerk fittings till new 
grease comes out.  If you do not jack the bus up the front king pins will not 
allow in the grease!  Grease the front end like this at least every three 
thousand miles and while it is up on the jack adjust the front brake stars 
for max braking power and brake shoe lifespan.  Eric&amp;Barb
