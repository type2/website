Subject: Shifter Lock Diagram

I have/had a shifter lock on my 65 bus.  Had to take it off to do some work and now I cannot figure out how the interior pieces are suppossed to go.
   
  Does anyone have a diagram for this?
   
  I seem to remember seeing one on the internet at some point, but I cannot find it now.
   
  Thanks.
