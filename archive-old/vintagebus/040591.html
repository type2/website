I know I'm probably starting a bit early but does any have plans yet for
Classic weekend?  Last year I camped out at Irvine Lake and had a blast.  I
will probably do the same this year but I would like to hear what y'alls
plans are.  Are any of you northwest caravanning down the coast?  I would
like to jump in with those in the slow lane.  I have had to miss a lot of VW
shows due to a change in job schedule so I'm getting pretty stoked about
this years Classic.  Again, sorry for bring this up so early but I'm going
through withdrawals for a VW show
