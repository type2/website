&lt;&lt; I ALMOST did that with the panel/camper thing I just parted out. But 
 someone wanted the whole nose section, so I just went ahead and took/cut 
 everything else that was salvagable off of it. Somewhere down the road I 
guess. &gt;&gt;

If you used two bus rear sections at both ends it would give you a hatch at 
each end which would make it more usable.
