Subject: manual carb

Cause a couple people asked me,  I though I'd post to the list

I got the carb from Bus Depot, and a choke cable from WW.   I'm going to go 
try to install the cable this afternoon.  Wish me luck.   The carb looks like a 
30 pict  (round bowl) with manual choke, and does indeed fit the 1600 SP 
manifold.   it's going on a DP 1600 for me.. but I don't know how it'll drive... 
yet.  Bet it'll be fine on a big bore 40hp.   it came with a 120 main jet... I 
have a 28 pict w/ 120 main on my 1600 in the 61, that gets me good milage, but 
less low end torque than the 30pict that didn't have quite as good milage.

I haven't bought a new carb since '91... wow... all shiny and new.
