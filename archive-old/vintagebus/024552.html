&gt; Any body on the list know if one of the vendors has
&gt; a complete kit to refurb the reduction boxes and axle

Wolfburg West lists most of these components. But more normal suppliers
(I consider WW and WCM and BFY &quot;botique parts houses&quot;) are available for
all of the bearings and seals, and even some of the gears. Ask a local
VW or foreign car shop or parts house if they buy from FAST ( IMC) or
WorldPac ( Fromerly ImPac)  or WAWD (in SoCal) and they can probably get
you better prices on many of the components. I called around and got the
best deal on bearings for my redux boxes (through the shop where I work)
from FAST in Portland OR. Problem with any of these companies is they
sell only to businesses, but their prices are good enough that even with
a mark-up they will be cheaper than the &quot;botique&quot; suppliers. 

Also, demand either SKF or FAG bearings. Avoid Timkin unless you drive a
ford, and never use any moving parts made in China or India.
