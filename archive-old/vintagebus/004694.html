&gt;It is indeed a 356/912 pulley.  The unfortunate part is that all 3 pieces
are
&gt;usually sold separately.  Not all that cheap, but will last forever when
taken
&gt;care of.  Don't forget to get a smaller belt also.  I seem to remember
running a
&gt;9.5 x 895 or 890.


BINGO - that's just the info I was looking for.  I'll try to locate a
Porsche place and talk the talk of the &quot;financially secure&quot; and then they
oughta be able to fedex it to me.  Thanks!  BTW:  Bernie wanted about $58
with shipping and all for the pulley.  Not cheap but needed.
