Subject: Re: [VB] VIN number help

The numbers came off of the VIN tag in the engine compartment. I was told it 
was a '61, but I will be getting a bill-of-sale and want to make sure I get 
the correct year on the title I will be applying for.


1960(09/30/59) 514 885  Beginning of 1960 Model Year
1960(12/59)    551 631
1961(05/60)    614 456
1961(12/60)    705 619

This chart didnt say when the '61 started, but if the '60 started 9/30/59, 
wouldnt this mean that the time period you mentioned would make it a '61 ?

&gt;
&gt;685157 if that is the chassis number means that it is a means that it was
&gt;made between 11/18/1960 and 12/06/1960 meaning that it would be a 1960!  
&gt;The
&gt;year changed with the 1963 model in August but till than it was with the 
&gt;new
&gt;year!   I just happened to be looking up M-codes when you asked!?
