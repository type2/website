Subject: Car Show in Chicago Aug.12

I would like to extend an invitation to all you fellow
Bulli owners to bring your buses to the Lincoln Square
Car Show in Chicago on Aug 12.  It will be on the 4700
block of North Lincoln Ave,  10:00-5:00

Unfortunatly it is not a VW specific show but because
Lincoln Square is the heart of Chicago's German
community I would like to see aircooled Volkswagens
prominently represented there.

See you there!!
Paul Leske
Vice President, Lincoln Square Chamber of Commerce
