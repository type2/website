Subject: Re: [VB] Clutch/trans problem

Have you checked the clutch arm itself under the front of the bus? 
Sometimes that spring can get soft or break and on my bus the whole 
assembly froze up, causing the clutch to stick and get pretty hard to push down. It's worth a look!

This is why some people appear bright until you hear them
