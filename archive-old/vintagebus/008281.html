Well I guess I am moving up the ranks now for I have purchased my first
split screen bus!!!! Not being new to type 2's though I have had westie
campers 1971 and 1976 one standard 1968, a 69 single cab and I currently
have a 1968 4 door crew cab.
Though yesterday when I picked up my 1963 23 window, I realized that this
was truly something special (what dreams are made of).
So I would like to say hello to everyone and I look forward to conversing
with you all. I have been on the bay window list for close to 3 years now so
I shouldn't be to much of a bother in the beginning.
If anyone is interested in seeing a picture of the new ride check out this
address.
