Subject: backfiring w/ vac dizzy

I put a vacuum advance distributor on my 1600sp for the
first time and it didn't work out very well. The dizzy is a
113 905 205M which I believe is correct for a '68 through
'70 bus with a 1600sp and 30PICT carb. My carb is the newer
Brosol H30/31PICT. The dizzy advances when I suck on the
vacuum line, holds the advance when I block the line. I
installed and timed the dizzy at sea level and there it ran
well. I take the bus up to the mountains and as I climb in
elevation, old bus starts to have problems. Coasting
downmountain in gear (essential engine braking) backfires so
much I'm afraid I'll lose the muffler. I tinker with carb
and timing a bit but it doesn't get much better. Dizzy
advances when I open throttle, when I release the throttle I
get lots of backfiring until the engine settles down at idle
speed. At Ebbett's Pass I could take no more and put the 009
mechanical dizzy back in. The bus ran great again and even
climbed the steep side of Tioga Pass (9945 feet!) without
incident, no more backfiring on the down side. The fault
must be with the vacuum dizzy setup, but what is it? The
vacuum port on the side of the Brosol carb looks really
tiny, and that seems suspect to me, but it ran great at sea
level. Huh?
Thanks, Joel and the '64 Sundial
