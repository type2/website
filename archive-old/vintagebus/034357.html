Subject: [VB]  Oz Cargo floor patch panels
Message-Id: &lt;5F23E32C8967D111A5D10000F81F6DE101D572E8_at_exchvic2.dsto_dot_defence_dot_gov.au&gt;

Well,

After much angst and time my first 
'production' run of cargo floor patch panels
are done.

I know this probably of minimal interest
to you guys in the US, where whole
repop cargo floor halves are available,
but this is another item that has never been
available in Oz, or if imported, available
at a heart breaking price ......

But it is interesting to see what CAN 
be 'hand made' ??????????????
