Subject: RGB's and spring plate not aligned

On the drivers side, I noticed the bolt near the shock was missing, and =
upon closer inspection, noticed the hole was even misaligned by about =
1/4 inch.  Nothing seems to be leaking, and all other bolts are good and =
tight, but I would like to have all four bolts in, of course.  I'm at =
one of those leave well enough alone points, but before I do anything, I =
just wanted some heads up.  I've read some accounts of people messing =
with these only to strip bolts, and have to re-tap etc.  Any advice =
appreciated.

Thanks
