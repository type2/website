Hi Steve,
Does sound like a bad grounding situation.  Which works by back feeding 
through the running light wire when that system is off, but shuts down that 
tail light when both the running light and brake light are on at the same 
time.  We solder ground wires to each of our bus tail lights to connect them 
to each other and then run a wire from the right tail light to where the 
battery ground strap mounts to the body.  This unfortunatly is a must for 
daily drivers.  VW in the early 1970s finally came to the same conclusion, 
and created a grounding system simular to this for the late buses.   Eric&amp;Barb

exactly.  Funny thing is that I have the later taillights in my  12V 61  (a 
DPO cut them for the 62-71 oval lights :(   ).  they have a push on 
connection attached to the bulb holder for a ground wire.  I had to clean it 
up to get it to work.   (each circuit worked sparately, but when taillight 
and brakelight were activated at the same time, no light)    Of course, this 
is a wet climate in the PNW, but I guess the point is corrosion in the wiring 
is a problem for old VWs, 6V or 12V, and though everything had been cleaned 
up when I got the bus, that was what five years ago hahahahahaha.   So out 
came the sandpaper and I did it again.
