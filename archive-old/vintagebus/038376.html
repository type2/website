'64 BUS - Dlx. Complete, runs sweet, $1900/obo. (206) 633-3006

I know nothing -- but I promise this JUST came on Seattle Times
advertisement.  If you call tonight, you will be the FIRST to get dabs at
this.  Will help long-distance purchasers.

1) Call them and get your questions answered.
2) Sounds like it is worth looking at?  Get me a street address.
3) Assuming it is within travel distance, I can go snap some digital photos
(15 or so) and do a first-hand rust report.

Let me know!
