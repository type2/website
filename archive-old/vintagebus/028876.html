&lt;&lt;i think the &quot;loose drain plug&quot; story is probably on an urban legends
website
somewhere... though i am sure this happens from time to time, it is
still a
classic paranoia-inducing tale.&gt;&gt;

How about a loose oil filler cap. I was in a hurry to get stuff done
before vacation and took my car into a service station with a good
reputation. Trouble was, they were busy too and let one of those
coneheads do my oil change. So I head out on the road and about an hour
later I see all this smoke coming from my engine. I pull over and open
the hood to gigantic flames!!! So I slammed the hood back down and
waited. And waited. Spent the night right there, as a matter of fact.
The next morning, I opened it up and there was my oil cap still sitting
in the engine bay.

An urban legend?? More like urban hell.
