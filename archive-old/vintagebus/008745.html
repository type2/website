&gt;Frodo, a 65 Westy, for it's new sheetmetal. Thanks to Ronnie at Old
&gt;Volks Home I have BEAUTIFUL Volkswagen labeled cargo floors and many
&gt;other well fitting parts. When they arrived I was tempted to have a

This is absolutely no joke.  Terry had a couple of tables in front of his
8bus with these new floors laying on them - honest to goodness VW floors for
a splitty - it almost brought tears to ones eyes. :-)

Terry was kind enough to take me along on the VW cruise the day of the show.
To me, it's an awe inspiring thing to ride around in an old split window
bus - even with a 40HP engine!  It gets up and moves surprisingly well.
Even though this bus won an ugliest VW award at one of the Omaha shows, it
still only has around 50,000 miles on it.  It doubled a storage shed and
living quarters for mice and cats for a while and the old piss took it's
toll.  The mechanicals however are still in great shape.  Terry is running
quite a few original parts because they simply aren't worn out.

T2erry is technically the 2nd owner of this bus.  There were some
intermidiate owners but they just bought and sold the bus - didn't do
anything with it to speak of.  I admire Terry's willingness to tackle
this project and I'm sure when he's done, he'll have a bus we'd all die for!
