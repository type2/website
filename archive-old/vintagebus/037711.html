Big thanks to Kris and all who ran the Bulli Brigade show.  It was great.  
Exactly how a show should be.

This was my first bus event since moving to FL.  I headed out from the East 
coast of FL a little before 5am and soon found myself chasing the moon as it 
was directly in line with the road I was traveling.  The moon was full and 
huge and lit up the countryside with an eerie light.  Took a couple hours to 
get to the show but I found it without a problem.  Amazed a couple Bug guys 
on the highway along the way by actually passing them in a bus while pulling 
a trailer.  Gotta love that 3.44 R&amp;P.  (see next post)  

It cost $2 to get in if you were driving a split.  The two bucks covered 
everything - show &amp; swap.  If you weren't in a split it cost $15 to swap but 
you couldn't park near the busses.  8-)  It wasn't a huge show like OCTO but 
it was good sized for a bus only show, maybe around 40 busses but I didn't 
really count.  There were about 10 each of crew cabs and single cabs, trucks 
everywhere!  There was also another Binz that showed up.  It was the one that 
came out of Texas a year or so ago.  We parked next to each other so we could 
compare.  Very cool to be able to touch two Binz (Binzes, Binzi?) at the same 
time.  It is the first time I have ever seen two together.  (It is for sale 
if anyone is interested in a Binz.  Email me)  It was a pretty casual 
gathering where the shiny busses and the primered busses were parked side by 
side.  There were some really fantastic busses there including a great single 
cab which was recently finished but was still driven a couple hundred miles 
to the show...in fact everything was driven.  Great show.  I really preferred 
it over the Bug Jam the next day.

A few (owners judged) awards were given away at the close of the show then. 
after a tire chirping burnout session, both split window bus and split window 
bug, we all caravaned up to the host hotel for Bug Jam the next day.  Stopped 
at a rest stop along the way for a photo op of all the busses lined up but 
also got a chance to put out an interior fire in a F150 while we were there.  
It was funny to see all the VW owners grabbing their extinguishers and 
running toward the truck.  That guy had to have been the luckiest guy in 
Florida that day.  What are the chances of catching on fire and having 
someone around with one fire extinguisher.  This guy had two dozen in less 
than 20 seconds.  8-)
