 I was curious if anyone has found an aftermarket clock that fits into a

North Hollywood Speedometer here in LA will rebuild and clean up the
clock, installing a quartz drive movement to replace the
electro-mechanical original guts. Charge is $120 complete, as of several
months ago. Look them up online search - google_dot_com.
