Please, stay away from chrome.  Been there, done that and 'bout killed a 
couple of engines due to the cheap chrome crap on the market.  The only way 
you might get away with a chrome engine is to take genuine VW sheetmetal and 
have it chromed.  Even then I would be concerned with it.

Just my .02 worth on a subject I learned about the hard way.
