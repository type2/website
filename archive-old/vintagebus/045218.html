Hi Boyd,
First drain all the oil out of them.  Unless you know for sure what the 
engines histories are, then it is best to just remove the P&amp;Cs throw them 
away and plan to do complete rebuilds.  If you plan to store them for a long 
or unknown time then remove the head studs out of the cases.  That way the 
engines will take up about 1/2 the space they would have.  Eric&amp;Barb
