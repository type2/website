While that in the weeds look might play well with the local surf scene I
am somewhat ambivalent to the thought of lowering my Kombie. It will
never be a show Queen or any such stuff.
having gone into the guardrail 70 miles outside of san antonio (Black
ice)I'm interested in better handling not ride height. around here the
speeds hardly ever get up to what you would get on a mainland freeway.
it's just that i'm thinking about taking it to the farm in Mo. from San
Jose CA and back before i put it on the boat home. It's got a fresh 1.5K
mi. 1600 SP in it now.
I have a balanced  1600 SP w/  a mild cam and a set of dual kadrons or a
28 pci w/o venturi and headers in my bug that I could swap into the bus
but not right away.
I drove the Kombie from FL to CA were it waits for me to ship it to
Hawaii.
The scarriest part of the trip was not the breakdowns but the lack of
power.
my 69 Westy didn't have this problem and it had a SP 1600as well...

Ccould I run 15&quot; rims and stay out of the big rigs way more effectively?

a tranny swap just for one road trip may be more work than it is worth
especially if you are planning to take it back to Hawaii where I can't imagine
people tend to drive fast and there are certainainly a number of mountain
roads you could drive on - meaning lower gears are probably better there and
regardless of gearing black ice can get you so just be careful of the ice.
If it aint broke dont fix it.

  The trick to driving a bus on the interstates is not to feel you need to
drive as fast as everyone else.   Just go along in the right hand lane at the
speed your bus is comfortable with.    You know they envy your sweet ride.
Take the side roads if there is a small roads going the same direction, better
scenery usually, and you can find those mom and pop malt places and stuff.
mmm malts.    roads trips.    I like to stop at those junk shops that claim to
sell antiques.
