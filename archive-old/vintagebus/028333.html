Subject: Dual 40 IDF carb parts needed!
References: &lt;200006060424.VAA42300_at_lenti.type2_dot_com&gt;

So I buy a pair of 40 IDF carbs off of the net. Pretty good deal $350 used 2 months. The part
the seller forgot to mention is that he broke the tip of one of the mixture screws off in the
brass seat that gets pressed into the carb. These parts are not available. Does anyone know of
a way to find two of these? I also lost one of the cup washers that hold the o-ring in place.
The mixture screw stack goes like this o-ring, the dished washer I need, spring, mixture
screw. The only part avialable is the mixture screw. So I could use two brass mixture screw
seats that press into the carb body, and one dished washer for on the mixture screw. I all
ready have a set of four mixture screws on order. Anyone have any leads? I have been searching
for an e-mail for Weber direct and have had no luck. I have done all of the obvious like CB
performance etc...
Any help would be appreciated.
Thanks in advance,
