Hi Peter,
Well the axle seals seem to stay good until a bearing goes bad and wallow the
seal out with the axle moving around.  If one bearing is bad the rest have
had a nice bath of steel shavings through them.  Once you are done removing
them you will want to just not have to do the job soon again and just replace
all of the bearings to insure longevity.  Eric&amp;Barb
