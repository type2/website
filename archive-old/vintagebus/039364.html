Hey All,

Has anyone replaced a noseskin complete with the 2 inner lower panels to a 
bus all at once?  My bus needs a nose and I know where a dry donar is 
(unsaveable)to cut a noseskin.  Is is crazy thinking to just cut my bus at 
the seem below the windows and overlap the new skin complete with the lower 
iner panels slightly overlaping the left and right lip?  I understand that 
I'll have to be real careful lining everything in front of the front floor.  
Any thoughts?

Thanks,

Eric
