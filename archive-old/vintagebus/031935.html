Okay, how do I explain this, hmmmm.  I know of no books, I went to college and
now make a pretty good living as a body tech.  So in other words I got to
practice on other peoples cars so I don't screw up mine!  Maybe this will
clear things up for you.  You know the up right flanges on the side of the
nose where the metal of the nose is crimped around the edge of the door
pillars?  These are Hemming flanges.  To cut off the old nose you what to cut
on the inside of the flange on the old bus nose, don't cut the pillar side.
You will also want to cut the lower flange, the horizontal one the same way,
about a 1/2 inch above the flange.  And for the top, below the windshields you
cut about 1/2 below where the nose meets the windshields.  This allows you to
pull your old banged up nose off and get it out of the way where you can then
see what your doing.  It's easier to uncrimp the flanges from two sides vs.
- - - --- 
ya- undo the flanges at the side.   Eastwood makes an unflanging tool which
will undo the flanges - beg borrow or steal on (or buy it)  I think it was
$60.  (cheap cheap cheap)  part number 6288 their phone no is (800) 820 9042
(if I can read my own writing).  I saw it being used on a bus nose, and it was
very cool.   hope I got the number right.  Think the tool flanges it again
too.  (is that a verb?)
