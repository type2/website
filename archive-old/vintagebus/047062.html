 Yesterday, I went out to where I have my 66 parts bus stashed. I wanted
 to rid it of the bee colony before they got too active so I can pull a
 few parts off of it. The story I got from the nice lady that gave it to
 me is that her husband (now deceased) had planned on restoring it and
 that he had dropped $1200 into the motor 20 years ago. I can't imagine
 what he could have had done to it back then that cost that much and so,
 was skeptical. But yesterday, I finally got to the engine compartment
 and pulled the dipstick and the oil looks bright and clear!!! So now, I
 am planning on pulling the engine. I wonder though. . . should I break
 the engine down?? It is very apparent to me that it has been sitting for
 a VERY LONG TIME!!

my theory is if it ain't broke don't fix it.   I would change the oil and 
adjust the valves.  Yes the oil is clean looking, but oil degrades, so go 
ahead and change it.   Pull the wire out of the center of the dist cap and 
turn the starter till the oil light goes out, then replace the wire and start 
it up and let it idle for about 20 minutes, then go ahead and change the oil 
again.   drive it just around town for the first 300 miles, no freeway 
driving.   I would not be surprised if the oil seals are bad, you may want to 
go ahead and pull the motor and change the main and oil cooler seals.   Are 
you going to make your parts bus a driver, or are you planning on putting the 
motor in something else?   If you are going to get the parts bus going there 
is of course other stuff you should do, not the least is drain the gas tank 
and put fresh gas in it, replace fuel lines and make sure you have good 
brakes, and good tranny boots and the transaxle is full of gear oil.
