Subject: stranded splitty on I-24 outside of Nashville, TN
Message-ID: &lt;371E8746.1D4_at_earthlink_dot_net&gt;

Ah well... saw a splitty, stranded, on my way home today... white over
blue. Noone around except beaucoup (sp?) traffic.
	I just hadda peek in the engine bay... which unfortunately sported a
view of the road down through where the rear tin used to be. No heater
hoses... fan air outlets unplugged.
	no wonder it broke down.
	I left a note offering assistance, seein' as how I live merely a mile
away...

peas,

Jason
