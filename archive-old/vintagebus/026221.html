Now that I can post (Thanks Thom) I have a question. I am going to
replace the transmission in my 67 Bus, where should I purchase it from?
I don't want to spend alot of money, but I don't want to sacrifice
quality for doing so. It will be mail-ordered if that factors into your
suggestions. Should I go stock or freeway flier? What do I sacrifice or
gain by both? What else should I replace/check for when I replace this
transmission (I just rebuilt the engine)? Thanks for your help.

On a side note, whenever I put my bus in reverse, it stalls out, even if
I have the clutch fully depressed. It doesn't grind into reverse or
anything. It drives fine in all the other gears (except for fourth which
it pops out of, why I am replacing the tranny in the first place). What
could be the problem? Thanks again.


Chris
