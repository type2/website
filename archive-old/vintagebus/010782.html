A friend of mine from Sao Paulo, who used to work for VW says 
they called them &quot;1.5 generation&quot; busses.  They still made them
up to about two or three years ago.  Now they have leapfrogged
ahead to a Eurovan (4th gen.)style, bypassing the Vanagon.

Thosr are brazilian buses.  Basically, VW sent all the tooling to VW do
Brasil
when they were done with it, and the Brazilians made buses with whatever
they had handy.
