Subject: Pritschenwagen on Parade

--0-1202518276-999698986=:94639


Hey all.  My 55 Single Cab will be on parade again this weekend.  The Lincoln Square Chamber of Commerce will be using it as a float in this years von Steuben Day Parade (of Ferris Buehler fame) in downtown Chicago.  The parade will take off from Monroe &amp; Balbo at 10:30 on Saturday.  There will also be a mini-parade later at the festival grounds in Lincoln Square.  (4700 block of Lincoln).   A couple of musicians from the Chicago Brauhaus will be on board playing German folk music.  Please visit and say hello as I will be driving. 

By the way, after the parade the truck &amp; my 66 Beetle will be for sale.  My wife says that I spend too much time &amp; money on old cars so I will only keep only the 66 Deluxe bus and 56 Packard.  Besides, I am losing a small fortune in lost garage rent every month.  The pritschenwagen is camouflaged so it would look great with a gun rack and NRA sticker.  :-)  hehehe (dont flame me, just joking).  I have pics on VW Planet so look it up under single cabs and there are pics from last year's parade as well.
