Subject: Single Cab off the 5 fwy
Message-ID: &lt;36FACEAA.B448935E_at_earthlink_dot_net&gt;

Hey folks from Southern California.  Does anyone know the story of the
nice 55-58? single cab sitting up on a lift right off the 5 fwy in Buena
Park (right around Beach Blvd., No. side of the fwy).  It is painted a
non stock two tone silver and is at a Chevy dealer.

This SC looks very complete w/hoops and a banner for the dealer on the
hoops.  Its been up there for the last 6 months rain or shine.  Anyone
know the story?  I stopped and asked and they said its NFS.

S.
