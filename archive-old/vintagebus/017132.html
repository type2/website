Subject: Engine suggestions

I know this isn't exactly vintagebus material, but it 
is concerning a vehicle with exactly the same engine as 
in my 67 camper. Anyway, you guys (and gals) know your 
VW stuff and I trust your advice so . . . I am trying 
to decided what to do with the ailing engine in my 69 
Beetle (the bearings are worn, definitly needs a 
rebuild before I drive it to school in the fall). I 
think I may start with a new case (or should I stick 
with the old?). But here is the question, I want to 
build a reliable, long lasting engine, but if I can get 
more power out of it without sacrificing reliablity, 
I'd like to do it. So what displacement do you think I 
should go for? Carbs? Cam? Exhaust? Just so you vintage 
nuts know, I would always keep my camper stock, 69 
Beetles run about a dime a dozen so . . . Thanks for 
the help.


-Chris
