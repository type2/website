Nope, never did sell.  

I listed it for sale because I was tired of people asking if it was for
sale.  Maybe that's what this guy did.  I'd actually had people who wanted
to just buy *parts* off of it; one guy wanted the bumpers, another guy
wanted the engine lid.  Hellloooooooo.....

BTW, it has *NOS* &quot;barndoor&quot; headlights.  And it only had the big-nut
tranny until I drug it home.  I have the correct steering wheel and shift
knob somewhere, but I like the barndoor ones better.

I offered the barndoor for sale for $100k one time.  It's a great way to
get people off your back.
