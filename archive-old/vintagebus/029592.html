&gt; I did the calculations and can find no possible way you could get 4800 rpm
&gt; with a small nut and 205/75 15 tires...
&gt;

I dunno...I think I've pulled that before.  I don't have a tach installed... but
the little speed tester the police put out on the highways told me my speedo read
5mph over.  165R15 tires though...  I've done 75mph (yes...on flat land in a
no-wind situation) according to the speedo (70mph actual) in my 62 bus with a
stock 1600 and 30PICT2 carb.  Original small nut tranny too.  What would that come
out to be in RPMs i wonder?  I only went that fast to see what it could do...then
i let off.  It could have gone a *little* more...but it was screamin'....  I
usually cruise at 60...55mph actual...and have pedal left over.   I drove it to
Missouri and back like that...1400 miles that extended weekend.
I figure the speedo is telling me the speed that I would be going if I had the
correct size tires on there....so I keep it at speeds I would drive if I had the
right tires on there...know what i mean? engine is turning the same rpms...just
the bus is going slower because of smaller tires.
Turns out I didn't roast my engine either... there was just a little washer that
got into the #1 cylinder...right now the engine is in the basement...I honed the
cylinders and am putting on new rings.  The engine is still nice and solid :-)
I'm also switching to doghouse this time...

I really should stick a tach in the 62 for a couple days... oh well.
