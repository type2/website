&lt;&lt;Do what I do to get door screws out and weld a bolt to it? (Are the plugs 
steel?)&gt;&gt;
That could work.  Both the box and plug are steel.&gt;&gt;

The reduction box halves are steel?  Are you sure?  I'll have to go look.

 &lt;&lt;Replace the reduction box half? (messy and a lot of work) &gt;&gt;
Messy, yes, but not a lot of work.  That way you could work the plug out in 
nicer easier conditions in the workshop.  Plus you should be completely 
dissassembling the brake system and this would mean the brake drum would be 
off anyway.

We already replaced all of the brake components, but I do have an extra reduction box half so that may be the way we go.  

    Above all do not use an easy out in this or any place where the threaded 
fastener is obviously stuck and thusly broken off due to corrosion.  
Easy-outs are good only in places where you know the threaded fastener is not 
frozen in place.

I've never had any luck with an easy out.  Anyone have any tips for getting a broken tap out of a front door screw hole?
