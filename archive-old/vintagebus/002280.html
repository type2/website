I just had one of those upper springs break - it was from a kit, and only lasted about 1000 miles. Hmmm....

&gt;As it turns out, after I removed the drum, the top spring that
&gt; holds the brake shoes together had snapped off on the end.  I don't know
&gt; what caused this but these are the brand new springs you get in the kits.  I
&gt; know the old stock springs that were on this bus were made of a thicker
&gt; guage metal.
