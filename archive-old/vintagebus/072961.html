&gt;What I need from the list is this, I need 4 names
&gt; for blends of coffee.  I would like to keep them VW
related, they do not have to be all bus related.&lt;&lt;

Here's a couple of coffee names for you:
&quot;Hydraulic Lifter&quot;- This would need to be a strong,
wake-up type of blend.
&quot;Blue Green Plaid&quot;- could be a blend of different
beans.
&quot;Yellow Vinyl&quot;- a smooth, slippery kind of blend.
&quot;Upright Flat Four&quot;- pick a blend of 4 different beans
here.
&quot;53 MPH&quot;- A nice mellow, after dinner, kicking back
and relaxing type of blend

Heres some names NOT to use:
&quot;Burnt Oil&quot;
&quot;Leaky Gasket&quot;
&quot;Black Driveway Spot&quot;
&quot;Dropped Valve seat&quot;
&quot;Spongy Pedal&quot;
&quot;Exhaust Aroma&quot;

&quot;So we got into the red VW microbus with the shovels and the rakes and the implements of destruction and we headed on to the police officer's station...&quot;
