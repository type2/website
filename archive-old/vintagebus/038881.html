re: VW emblem help

So Wolfsburg West sent speed nuts to fasten the emblem, and I liked the O-Ring
Idea. O-Rings with speednuts passed my accelerated life leak test with the
pressure washer.

re: flash light and small mirror and  with the front kick panels out the lower
inner surface of the nose anyway behind the nose...

Took the advice and found about 10 lbs. of wet composted mice and their nests,
looks like the decon got them, under it was one of  the small wood handled
screwdrivers from the bus tool kits.
