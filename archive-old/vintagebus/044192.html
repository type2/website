Reading all these responses about hippies and their lack of ability and competence to even read a gauge has prompted this hippie to respond, so here goes:  We hippies know exactly what those gauges mean as I will now explain:  That one little gauge thingy on the left that has a needle and says 1\1 on the right, 1\2 in the middle, and R on the left is the gas gauge, when it gets close to R it means that its time to go to the gas station and buy some more snacks because at this point you're bound to really have the munchies!  The big dial gauge thingy in the middle is the speedo and when it consistently stays below the 30 mark it means that you are either getting too stoned to drive or that you have now entered the mountain range you have been expecting to cross, either way, its time to pull over and take a nap.  The in - set number counter in this bigger dial thingy tells you how far you have gone since the last Rest Area (ie, when you put that last buzz on, or how far it is to!
!
 the next Dunkin' Donuts).  So there!! Don't go talking about how the hippies don't know stuff and how they don't, uh, oh, uh, sh*t! What was I talking about again?!?!?! I lost my train of thought....
Peace! John Baker
