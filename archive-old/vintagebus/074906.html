Subject: The importance of fire extinguishers

I am not going to say too much here, except that what was a fantastic find,
ie. all the bits were there, and the restoration was only a couple of
cosmetic touches has now turned into a complete monster.

Please guys (&amp; gals), if our loss can save you yours, by stirring you into
action to buy and keep a decent powder extinguisher at hand when doing
engine work, then at least it was not totally in vain.

Fortunately, no-one (except Betty bus) was injured in the above tragedy.

Regards
James
