Subject: [VB] abused list used to slam b4 checking facts
Message-ID: &lt;38565F30.CDE34E6_at_earthlink_dot_net&gt;

After reading the posts about the *bad apple* and the resulting warnings
about posting such warnings, then reading the following folks praising
the list and how it *supposedly* helps reduce the risk of being screwed
by that same person or company....then reading all the plfvw/todd hill
posts, i have come to this conclusion.

the list is, or is on the border, of becoming abused.  many,many, many
of you jumpped in chiming how it is great to post the bad apple
warning.  remember you are not the one being accused of not paying.  do
we know if this gentlemen has gotten in an accident and is laying in
icu??  no.  do we know if he lost his job and is desperately job hunting
ever minute?  no.  we dont know.  do we know if the guy who *supposedly*
was not paid ACTUALLY tried to establish contact in DIFFERENT ways
BEFORE posting to the list??  no.  i stand by the posts about....say,
gex.  they have an enormously long track record with numerous posts,
documented in some cases with long transcripts of attempts to contact
the company to return items.  these kinds of posts are more factual, and
some times take many weeks and months of trying to call a company to do
good by its products and get a problem fixed.

most of you may feel differently about your current *praise* for the
ability to discredit the poor soul who slights you or isnt as prompt as
YOU think he should be.  things happen in others lives of which NOT ONE
OF US IS FULLY AWARE!!  please do all you can to contact this person b4
slamming it to the list.

i remember one guy who did try a number of months back to contact todd
hill.  he posted ALL of his mails that he sent to todd.  he posted ALL
of the responses todd gave claiming to send said items.  he posted the
DATES of all the attempts.  this my friends, is a clear attempt to give
the party ample opportunity to get it settled.  THEN and ONLY THEN, by
all means post away.

i belive that by having free rein to post these *bad apple* warnings,
will slow and possibly stop the trading that does go on on the list.
heavien forbid i get a part from someone and  the payment doesnt get
there the second you think it should, for fear you will post to the
list.  i have had to make a few attmpts at times to get payment on some
items i have sold.  but it is AMAZING how a KIND message will invoke a
positive response rather than one demanding payment, or&quot; i will post
this to the list &quot;.  perhaps simply ask &quot; if they got your mails, or has
something come up, or whatever&quot;...be kind, you will probably get your
money.  then you will know for later not to do business with them.

lets use the list to warn others...but please do what you can b 4
slamming to the list....sometime you may be on the other end of the
slam.

zzz...who will still trade/sell parts with listees..=)...
     ...and is in no way connected to the previous *bad apple* caper!!
