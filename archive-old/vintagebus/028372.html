there is some other product called q-pads or quick pads they are mentioned on
a site where some guy went through rustproofing and soundproofing his VW...i
think you could find the link through the library...I have never tried any of
these sound proofing things but  a friend tried some from jc whitney on his
aircooled vehicle, and said it didn't really work at all...
