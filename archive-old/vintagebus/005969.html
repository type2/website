A transport truck showed up at my work today to drop off a car. [I work at a
Mercedes dealership in Fresno, Calif]
On the truck was a 67 Kombi camper conversion with a roof rack. It was
white/primer with the original black/yellow plates and no bumpers. I asked
the driver about it.....he said he picked it up in Los Angeles and was
delivering to the Bay area. Anyone on the list??
