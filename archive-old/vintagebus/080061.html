Subject: Re: [VB] Reduction Gear Box Leak

Dependins wher eit is leaking.

If it leaks from the seal outside the backing plate... that's wher eyou have 
to fix it.   the thingy the seal goes into can rust , which causes leaks.  And 
the thing that goes in the middle of the seal.  pardon my techical terms.

If it leaks between teh box and the spring plate, it's the plug. .. if you 
have the later RGBoxes.  The little nut boxes have no stupid plug.  You can pull 
and reseal there, or clean it all copiously and use gobs of permatex between 
the box and the spring plate.   One bus I saw leaked there, but ONLY when 
jacked up, when running or sitting, no leaks.   box hangs lower when bus in jacked 
up, so must be a gap up higher.

hope that helps

My reduction gear box was leaking on my &quot;61 Panel, so I split the case and
replaced the gasket using some permatex. It stll leaks, though not as bad. Any
suggestions?
