Subject: Las Vegas Imperial Palace splittie FS

We are cruisin' the strip here in Vegas and wandered into the Imperial
Palace car collection.  It is now a For Sale Lot.  Big buck stuff, but
hiding over in the corner was a 1966 Sundial camper with 'original red
leather interior'?? Extra hole plugged in the roof, maybe an original
westy rack, said it came with a tent that was not on display.  The
undercarriage was not restored and it was hard to know what else (how
close can you get with the armed guard looking over the area.)  There
were some cool probably black light flowers on the ceiling.  It was a
walk through.  Sorry forgot the camera so no picks.

Oh and the price .....$23,500

Glad we got into the 'car collection' free.
