&gt; I am now on my 58th VW.

You should know better by now!!

&gt; I NEVER drive on freeway.
&gt; I trailer them to shows.

You poor soul!

&gt; I will sometimes drive three or four blocks before getting
&gt; back in the garage.
&gt; Folks actually drive their VWs?

15,000 miles a year,without a problem, going on three years. ( I did run out
of gas twice)

&gt;

&gt; Maybe I live in the wrong place.

90% of my miles are in Chicago!

&gt; Go to work, 18 miles freeway, go 75 to 80 mph or get run over.
&gt; VW won't do this:(

Yes they can!!

&gt; Weekends, Tijuana, Bad roads, playing bumper cars. to change lanes
&gt; you must push car in lane you selected out of the way.
&gt; VW won't do this:(

Come to Chicago sometime I'll demonstrate!

&gt; Come back to Sandy Eggo, wait at border, up to 2 hours idling.
&gt; VW won't do this:(

Try rush hour coming out of O'hare!

&gt;
&gt;
&gt; I love VWs!!!  I want to go 75 mph, NEVER, EVER run hot...
&gt; Idle for hours and not run hot.  This is what I want.
&gt; My bus goes 8 blocks before vapor locking and I must wait
&gt; for her to cool down for an hour to go another 8 blocks.
&gt; I love the thing.  It just isn't drivable.
&gt;  No way.

I'll bet your timing and dwell are off!

&gt; It will get stolen, vandalized, scratched, dented, broken into,
&gt; If someone was to break one of my corner windows I would go bankrupt.
&gt; I love my bus.

Why do you think Vw. sold millions of these trucks?
 Because they are reliable,cheap,easy to work on, work mules!!!!!!
Try a little harder to get them running better  and you'll love them
more!!!!!!!!!!!.

&gt; '62 Type 113.  runs hot...
&gt; '62 Type 251.  runs hot...
&gt; '91 Mercedes 300SD  Go anywhere and run cool...

    &quot;stop pulling and start pushin'&quot;
