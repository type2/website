&gt; Wonder what that 3rd door accomplishes? Also noticed its not QUITE the same

the 3rd door provides easier access into the interior so you dont have to
crawl in.  Probably a short set of steps behind it.

&gt; as the brochure cover....did coachbuilts vary THAT much from original
&gt; concept?

????  where isnt it the same as the brochure cover?  The lower section of
the door area? That might well be a dropable gate?  c'mon wade!  Without
examining th ebus first hand, as well as the brochure, how do we not know
that there were not 2 different door styles available?

gads boi. cantcha let people be?:)
