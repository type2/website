&lt;&lt; I'm in a parking garage at work, and needed to just get it done somehow.  I
 figure if I pull the engine out it might attract attention.  If I could just 
squeeze the thing in there from underneath, I wouldn't get the parking lot 
monitors on my case.  Frankly, the idea of pulling the engine out sounds a 
bit scarey to me. &gt;&gt;
Hi Chris, 
We used to do this at an apartment complex that had the same silly rules 
about doing any major work on you auto in the parking lot.  We would back the 
bus into a spot against the concrete wall in the most quite part of the lot.  
Then remove the engine just 1-1/2' to 2'  back set on a pair of 2x4s&quot; and 
4x4s&quot; under the heat exchangers so as to allow working on the clutch or other 
engine/tranny part.  That way the engine being out of it's normal place was 
not readily apparent and work was done out of sight under the bus.  Eric&amp;Barb
