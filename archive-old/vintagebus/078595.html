Subject: Progressive jets

Volks,

Anybody have an idea what a jet a progressive should be using at 4500
ft. elevation, with a bigger engine?  1835, that is, and .044 heads.  I
am only getting about 18 mpg.  Less with this !_at_#$! oxygenated fuel.

I know Eric says a different dizzy will help, and that is in the plan .
. .

Curt
