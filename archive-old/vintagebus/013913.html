Subject: [VB] Parking light ground?
Message-ID: &lt;19991107165545.19825.rocketmail_at_web606.mail.yahoo_dot_com&gt;

Hello list,
Was gettin the front parkin lights workin this
morning. Done... they work... but before we tackle the
turn signals, a quick question. Where the parking
light wire connects to the light socket, theres also a
connector right next to it on the socket &amp; is grounded
to the bucket itself. Is there supposed to tbe a
ground wire there goin to the body or sumthin? I mean,
the lights work, but....
Suggestions?
