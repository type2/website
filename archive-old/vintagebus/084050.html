BTW,  what is a BN4? is that the reserve 
tank valve? My late model split didn't  have that.



Hi Chris,
We can answer that!  BN4 a model of gas heater built by  Eberspacher.  It is 
an easy install to put in a reserve switch in any  1950-71 gas tank.  Nice to 
have the last gallon in reserve and be able to  shut off the fuel flow when 
pulling engine or just replacing the flex fuel  line!
