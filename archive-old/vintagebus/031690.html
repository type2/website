A MATCHBOOK placed about 2/3'S of the way up the wing vent stops the
whistling that I have, unless there's a good tune on the radio that I
whistle along to tooling down the highway.

ronnie, came in early to pull my engine before RB/KP trip, going to install
new heater boxes and conect my heater back up. It might be in the 90's here
but I hear it's cooold up north.

My vent wings whistle horribly (or is it beautifully!?).  I will make them
stop.  I will develop a nice-looking addition to the existing rubber that
has more plushy flex.  When I do this, and have great success (no
whistley/no leakey), I will pass this info on to you.  Count on it.

Confidence is high.

I have already (carefully) bent the latch plate in....I can press the wing
closed at the bottom as hard as I can, and the whistling doesn't stop until
I move my hand halfway up.

Gene
