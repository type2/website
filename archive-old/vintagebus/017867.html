&quot;Everett Barnes&quot; &lt;everettb_at_thesamba_dot_com&gt; asked for
experiences with shipping gates.

Shipped a set of gates from Phoenix to NorCal to a
lenti listee many years ago. Bottom line is that UPS
and the local &quot;we mail anything&quot; stores wont do the
deed. Had to contract with Yellow Freight Lines (South
Phoenix). The buyer had an insider connection so the
shipping cost was moot.
As an aside, the gates were in pretty nice condition
compared to what is common now-a-daze. Explained at
length (pre-internet photo attachments) via the phone
and ran all over Phoenix attempting to do a good deed
and get these things shipped. Recieved the email
telling me that they had made it to the destination in
the title. Opened it up expecting the guy to thank me
for helping fill the void only to have him go ape-sh**
at their condition. Honest mistake. Thought that I was
helping. I don't ship gates or go too far out of my
way any longer.
