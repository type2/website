Subject: Barndoor &amp; NOS parts on Ebay
To: undisclosed-recipients:;



I just put several more parts on Ebay.  More to come in the following weeks.
 
http://cgi3.ebay_dot_com/aw-cgi/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewListedItems&amp;userid=thatvwguy

There was a little snafu last week when I ended an auction early on a 16&quot; 
rim.  I had a trade offer on a part I really needed.  Sorry if I left anybody 
out there hanging.  I won't end anything early again.

Thanks,
Dan
