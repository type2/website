Subject: Bus seat belts.
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

I bought some tan &quot;bus&quot; seatbelts on ebay. I cleaned
them up and they're in awesome condition.

So I install them on ol' DARTH, and to my surprise
(chagrin), you need to have a waist size of about 12&quot;
to fit in the seat with the belt fastened on it's
loosest setting.
details:
Mine is a 67 1/3 - 2/3 bench seat. M-codes have
seatbelt mounts installed. They are giant eye-bolts on
the back outer corners of the seat stand, and a pair
under the back center on the floor of the spare-tire
well.

Think these belts I got are for a walk-thru? They had
hex-bolts on them, not the eye-loop things.


I can actually fasten the driver's one if I breathe in
really deep. But if I'm wearing a sweatshirt, or gain
one pound, or have 2 ounces of fluid in my bladder, no
dice. I figure if I even tap someone with the thing
fastened I can say goodbye to having any more
children.

SO:  Anyone have some corrects they want to
sell/trade?

Or, thinking new, has anyone mounted three-point belts
in their split (like the non-retractors that Wolfsburg
West sells?)? I imagine some welding is in order.
