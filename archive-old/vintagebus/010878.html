Hey all. I happened across an ad in the Des Moines Register today about
a 67 21 window bus for sale. The price is 5k.... I went to take a look
since buses are few and far between around here and was mighty
surprised. This bus was  COMPLETE with a rebuilt mtor and looking
sweet.. It had very little rust and looks as if it has been sitting in a
barn hidden for years.... All of the interior is there and in really
good shape.  This is one nice bus.... I would buy it myself except for
the fact that the guy wants actual money which I don't have.  Oh
well.......But  I know someone else must have a little xtra johnny cash
laying around that's burning a hole in their pocket....And what better
way to spend it?  Since I don'thave the cash I figured I would pass
along the info.. I don't have anything to do with the bus, I'm just
passing on info.. But if you have any questions let me know. I stood and
looked at it for an hour.....The phone # is 515-282-7940 it's at Jerry's
Bug Shoppe. You could probaly pick it  up for 4500. And the 2/3 middle
seat is worth that much...at least on  EBAY! !!!!!!! Oh yeah. today is
my 30th b-day so if anyone wants to know what to get me, how about 5k or
this bus.....I'm not picky! See ya.........Shawn AKA (birthday boy)
