&gt; suggestions such as what type engine to build, carbs, 
Keep it stock, man!  A single-port 1600 may not be as powerful as a 1776cc
w/ dual Webers, but it will out last it (100,000 miles+++) for sure, and
maintanance it very minimal.  And if you're going for maintanance free
trips, go with a stock Soles carb.

&gt; seatbelts (two or three points),
I use just lap belts from Rocky Mountain Motorworks.  They look and work
great!

&gt; tire sizes front &amp; rear, 
Stock tire sizes for the correct RPMs of highway speeds.

&gt; special whatever to keep my breakdowns to a minimum?
Stock running gear, and a good tune-up.

&gt; BTW, what's the difference between a standard and a Kombi?
A standard has interior panels with vinyl and chrome trim and pleated
vinyl seats upolstry and a cloth or vinyl headliner.  A Kombi has masonite
interior panels in the front and no panels in the rear.  They also don't
have cloth headliners and don't have pleated seat covers.

Hope this helps!
