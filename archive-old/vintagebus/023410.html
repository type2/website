Hi Volks,

&gt; Sure looks like a Splitty rear end !

but it only looks like one.  A pal of mine scored a Fridolin rear 
hatch on a Bug meet in Germany, for DM 10, planning to put it on our 
'&amp;2 panel -- but the darned thing won't fit!  It's too short (IIRC), 
and the beltline is too low down (I'm certain).

&gt; Boy, getting one of these is sure to get you a winner in your class at
&gt; every VW Show you attend :)

Not in Europe... there are a few.  Restored to original condition and 
painted postal yellow, or powered with a Ford V6 and done in &quot;Cal 
Look&quot;, or anything in between.  But I agree they're rare for a 
Volkswagen.  Rarer than the Type 34 Karmann Ghia, but not as rare as 
the Hebmüller convertible ;-)

&gt; Someone should save these photos off on a permanent web site, I'm sure
&gt; they won't last long on the net.

I tried to get there, but I got errors -- maybe they're already taken 
down?

Yours,
    Erik.
