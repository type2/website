Subject: Re: [VB] 54 Barndoor

&gt; I am 6'2&quot; and it was the first thing I notice, that my view was out the
top
&gt; 1/4 of the window.  It doesn't impair my vision, however you are riding in
a
&gt; much different spot then the a 72 van.

I'm 6'2&quot; - 6'3&quot; and the only way I can see out of the bus while driving is
because the springs are shot and there is a hole in my driver's seat.  I'm
afraid if I ever redo the seats, I'll sit too high and have to cut a space
bubble viewing port in the roof so I can see.  I might have to tack it on
with some bark brown silicone and pop rivets. :-)
