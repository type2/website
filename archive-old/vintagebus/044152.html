As you all have read, I brought home my first split yesterday.  Drove 7 hours and towed it back on a dolly in 30 mph winds.  P.O. promises me it ran great for him, but it has been sitting all winter.  I try to start it, it cranks &amp; cranks, but nothing.  I spray a little starting fluid in the carb and it starts and run for a few seconds before dying.  I repeat, same thing.  Following Muir's instructions, I check the fuel pump (which looks new) by taking the fuel line off the carb and turning the engine over with a wrench.  I do get some gas coming out of the line, but not much.  Do mechanical fuel pumps go bad when they sit for a few months??  Muir says take the screw off the top of the fuel pump to inspect screen, but my fuel pump has no screws or bolts on top that I can see??  Does this sound like a fuel pump?? Bad carb?? Any suggestions about he next diagnostic test I should try?  Thank you all for the responses to my previous inquiry, on eof these days I'm gonna know all ab!
!
out the splits and be able to give others advice, but for now, HELP!!
