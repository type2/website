Subject: Re: [VB] engine

I recently rebuilt my DP engine top-end. The cylinders are 90.2's and
the new heads were hemi'd to match the old heads that were in there. I
wanted to keep the design that I've been running with. The old heads were
short-reach plug types 041, and since they weren't available anymore at
Rimco, I went with long-reach 044 heads. Hopefully they'll be resistant
to cracking between the valves. The 041 heads had cracks at the #3 and 4
positions.
We'll see how it goes - these are my first long-reach type heads.

&gt; Yes, I've heard about that, and that they were designed that way to be
&gt; stronger aggainst cracking.    Anyone have experience with these?  I mean,
&gt; anyone look at these heads after they were run in a bus for many K miles?
