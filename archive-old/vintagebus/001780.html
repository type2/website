...working on my daughter's f*rd this afternoon.

I cant get a nut on the muffler to come off (tried gallons of WD40, heat);
Idont have a torch to cut it off.
I thought I remember somebody out there talking about a ?nutcracker? that
you can use to split a nut.  I am going to Sears (my wife is _making_ me go
to the mall, so I may as well  make the best of a bad situation) in a bit.
If such a beast exists, what would it be called??  I cant afford the cutting
tool I would rather buy for my compressor; looking foor a cheap alternative.

... VW content.  If I get her car fixed, she won't bother me to drive the
bus &lt;&lt;grin&gt;&gt;

Thanks in advance; Rich
