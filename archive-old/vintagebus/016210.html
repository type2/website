Subject: wing window seal
Date: Sat, 06 May 2000 22:56:11 PDT
Mime-Version: 1.0

I am trying to replace the vent wing seal on my bus. The seal is the one 
that actually holds the glass in the frame. I broke the glass and will now 
have to temporarily run plexiglass to fill the void. My question is when I 
get another piece of glass how do I replace the seal without breaking 
windows?
