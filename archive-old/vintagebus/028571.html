This is how prices go nuts.  Someone puts an unrealistic price on a bucket o
sheeeot and other folks say &quot;well my very nice what ever is got to be worth
more than that&quot; as if the pile of crap has sold.  Now, your bus probably is
worth what you think it is, and I'm sure it is a great bus.  But, don't base
the value of your bus on someone's unrealistic expectation of what they &quot;might&quot;
sell their POS for.  Notice no one has bid on that bus yet

There is no true valuation on that particular bus. Let alone that valuations of
anything sold on E-bay is totally WHACK!

Enjoy your bus!  Screw the speculators!   Right on Buzz.
