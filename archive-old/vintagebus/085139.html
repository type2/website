Subject: RE: [VB] re:Battery Recommendation

If you speak so highly of the battery, get a new one. They are not too much.
I still think the problem lies in a power leak in the system. Im sure that
is not the technical term-Matt R can provide that.

Subject: Re: [VB] re:Battery Recommendation

Should I start running down a possible short somewhere in the electrical
system, or should I suspect that a cheap battery, combined with long periods
of not starting the car, as the culprit?  Trying to do anything/everything
to not have to start looking for a short/power drain.  The wiring harness in
this particular bus is pretty strait, not hacked up at all.  I'm the 2nd
owner of the bus, and it was pretty solid when I got it.

Thanks again,
Ed
