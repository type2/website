There is a top notch place for VW stuff in Lanham that is having an open
house on Friday.  Peek Performance is hosting the Bug On Saturday at 75-80
Dragway (home of the MotorWeek track tests) and Friday there will be a bunch
of VW lovers there...I live in Annapolis and frequent the shop.
http://www.peekperformance_dot_com on the net for all the details...  And I
would agree with the slight detour around WW Bridge.
