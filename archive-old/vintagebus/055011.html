Subject: RE: [VB] Another Engine Question

In the 3 NEW VW Mexican engines I have disassembled there were NO gaskets
under the cylinders, maybe they forgot on these?  These had GREEN silicon
(or substance of some origin) under the cylinders.

Ronnie

ps. I have taken the heads off of 1 new VW Brazilian engine but failed to
look under the cylinders on it, but did notice that the heads on these are
cut like a type 4 (shallow) and will not work on any other VW engine and the
fins on the cylinders go almost to the top of the barrels, thus, no other VW
head will interchange on those!

I'm confused, if VW doesn't use paper gaskets anymore, then why are they
STILL under each and every cylinder that comes out of Argentina, Brazil, and
good ol' Mexico where all the models are still built. Even the commercial
aircooled VW engines still carry the paper gasket, it is still in the VW
service manuals, and every gasket kit from every country of manufacture
still includes them.
just a thought

There is a service bulliton that states from VWoA to delete the paper
gaskets from under the cylinders. They say to use silicon VW part number
******** I will try to find it if I feel like going through all my books.

Gene Berg told me years ago (Gene did tell you!) that VW no longer used
the paper gaskets between the engine case and cylinders.  I don't use
them.  Gene is gone now but I am still afraid of going against his
&quot;suggestions&quot;.   Gary Gibson
