Subject: September VW Trends covers Safari Latch Replacement
Date: Fri, 10 Jul 1998 22:09:31 -0700

FYI... subjects says all.

They also cover upgrade of brakes to dual circuit on bugs/Ghia.  I saw a
recent post on doing this on a type2, maybe this bit in VW Trends might
offer some overlap on general procedure...
