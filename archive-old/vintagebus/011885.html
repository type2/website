A reminder:  If you must (say if you are in East Armpit, Nebraska and
need to get out of town fast) use 195/75R14 tires you _must_ buy load
range D tires.  Load range C in this size has less capacity than
185R14 _passenger_ tires!

Do the right thing.  Buy the right size.  You'll be happier and there
will be a greater chance of 185R14 light truck tires remaining in
production for a bit longer.  They don't cost any more, and your
engine will thank you for getting the larger diameter tires.

What French?  The last time I bought a set of XZX's for my D*tsun they
were made in (1) USA, (2) Canada, (3) Taiwan, and (4) Belgium.  Yep,
four tires, all the same make and model, made in four different
countries!
