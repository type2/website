There is a ball joint front beam on my 59 single cab.   (drum brakes).   I
didn't do it.  It is there.  

Ball joint beam  ball joint beam
The front is like a split and the back is like a truck
Ball joint beam, ball joint beam,
It's taller in the front, and it rides like a duck

If I say I have ball joints, people ask if I have disc brakes.    It doesn't
seem it was done for any particular reason (going from the general state of
thebeast) except that the old one was probably shot and they replaced it with
this.

lug rims all the way around.

Jeremy,
I have gotten as far as installing the 69 beam with the ball joints instead of
king pins in my 67. The king pins were worn out and the cost of a beam with
new ball joints, was about the same as rebuild king pins. The front end now
rides softer than with the king pins which I think is okay. But it rides a
little higher. I plan to add the Bus Boys Albatross beam conversion when I do
the next step. I have done the research on the disc conversion and have every
intention of doing it by next summer. Since I have the 67 master cylinder with
dual circuits, I don't plan to go to the vacuum assist master cylinder unless
