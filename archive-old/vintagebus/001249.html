&gt; tightening the nuts against each other- you nee to use two wrenches. the
&gt; adjustable kind or a 27mm.   But if you dont hold that inner nut, it will
&gt; tighten too.  And the wrench holding the inner nut has to be slim enough
so
&gt; the outer nut can still turn.  Or you can use the bay window style front
axle
&gt; nuts- the ones with those allen screws to lock them in place.  SO
definately
&gt; check to see if the thrust washer moves after you snug the axle nut (s) in
&gt; place


Easiest way is to use 68-79 bay window wheel bearing nuts.
I can get them in the wrecking yards here in Fresno, Calif if anyone wants a
pair. Let me know.
