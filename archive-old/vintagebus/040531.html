I guess that's my cue...

Eric &amp; Barb's panel is a great ride on the freeway.  They have a CW crank in 
the 1641 motor, and it literally sounds like a sewing machine.  It held 70 
MPH easily, and still had oomph to accelerate up to around 77-80 if it had 
to, but the temp gauge began to climb a bit when you did.  We went for a 
short ride around olympia, so no mountain passes to report on.  Up in the 
cab, it was nice and quiet.  You could still hear the motor, of course, but 
it didn't cause sensory overload.  Cruising in the right lane with the motor 
humming in back, and keeping up with the traffic on a nice warm summer day, 
Ahh..

I'm currently getting a 1600DP built for my bus, and I will try it with the 
mystery tranny that is in my bus right now.  if/when that tranny goes, or if 
I don't like what it can do with the 15 inch rims I have for it, I will 
replace it with something akin to E &amp; B's setup.

for what it's worth,

'64 SO-35 lotsa bodywork to go before it gets a motor.

&gt;Anyone who want to take a ride in our 1960 panel with freeway flier just 
&gt;make
&gt;prior arrangments with us and we will be happy to!  Mike A. from Salt Lake
&gt;got a ride in it this last spring, was a blast to see the shocked 
&gt;expression
&gt;on his face when he experienced how it kept up with most of the traffic in 
&gt;a
&gt;70 MPH zone and was still quite enough in the front seats to talk in normal
&gt;levels!   Eric&amp;Barb
