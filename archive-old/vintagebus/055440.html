Was there supposed to a gasket between the intake manifold and the heads?  &gt;&gt;

Hi John,
Yes, there was and has always been a copper coated steel compressible sealing 
O-ring on each and every SP ACVW engine.  Only the size of these O-rings 
changed over the years.  Check out the 63-67 Bus parts manual on
