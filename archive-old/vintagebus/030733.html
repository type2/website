&gt;Lighter location?
&gt;
There was a '58 Double Cab at my house last week, it had a lighter almost
right where the gas gauge would go on a later Bus.  Dumb location, I think.
 Chrome ashtray too, hmmm.

My '55 Kombi has a couple holes to the left of the speedo pod, one I have
been told was for a cigar lighter, the other I do not know.  I'll probably
put an accessory socket in the 2nd hole for a Black Helphos spotlight I
have.  The 2 holes are arguably dealer-installed.
