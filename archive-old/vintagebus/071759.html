&gt; The winder mechanism in my clock is burnt out. I have heard you can put
the
&gt; gubbins from a battery powerd clock in its place. Does any one know where
I can
&gt; get one from in the UK . What mechanism to use. TIA Mike

Unless one of the copper windings is broken, the problem is probably the
little arm that is supposed to 'snap' the disk around. I've got some pics of
mine when I was rebuilding it, and can show you some things to look for.
There should be an insulating material halfway up the arm to keep it from
grounding out, also, a small gap should be in place between the arm and the
coil to give it free movement. I'll see if I can get time to load the pics
tonight for you if you would like. I had to rebuild mine because it looks
like the housing filled with water (cracked windshield) and rusted all the
clock innards together. Works great now though!
