Put in the &quot;standard&quot; amount of oil, then start the bus to fill the lines,
etc.  Then check again, and add enough to get it to the proper mark on
the dipstick.

&gt; I don't know really how much oil I should put in the bus now that there is a
&gt; spin-on filter attached to it.  I know to fill up the filter before I put it
&gt; on, but then there's a little over four feet of oil-line to fill up, too.  
&gt; Should I put the oil in the lines before attaching the hoses?  Or should I
&gt; measure how much oil the hoses hold, and add that much to the 3.5 quarts in 
&gt; the engine?  Maybe I'm paranoid, but I want to do it right :-)
