I had the same thing on my '64 Sundial. PO or even before him had a spare
mounted up front and hit something. He then did push the nose out a bit but
to do it he had to drill dozens of holes in it. All that was then covered
with bondo. Sic!!! I mean the entire front was nothing but bondo at some
places 1/2 inch thick. I used torch to remove it all and then hammer inch by
inch until I got fairly straight surface. If there are any holes or cuts
you'd have to weld them first anyway. Strip the whole thing before applying
bondo since it will not stick that good to paint. Angle grinder would work
best in this case and some 50 and 80 grid sand paper. Once you start
applying bondo make sure you don't put too much of that stuff on since it
might crack later on. Well, hope this helps. Right now on my '63 Micro I'm
trying to hammer every dent as flat as possible so I don't have to put as
much bondo to smooth things out.

Good luck. (welding is not that bad. Try it and after a while you'll be
welding like a pro, hopefully)

Later,

&gt; &gt; I am beginning the bodywork on the nose of my '64 westy.  i knew there
was
&gt; &gt; some bondo there, but the more I work at it, the more I find.  Sigh.  It
&gt; &gt; looks like i will need to replace the nose section.  Now the question,
&gt; what
&gt; &gt; is the best way to do this.
&gt;
&gt; That's like asking what is the best way to hit your thumb with a hammer.
&gt; Best to try fixing the original with a hammer and dolly and a torch. Once
&gt; you're all practiced out, either it will be allright or you can go on with
&gt; the welding.
