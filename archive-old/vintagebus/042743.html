&gt; What math shows not possible to have 4800rpms at 60mph?   
Well,

I assumed a 4.12 ring and pinion, and calculated for 205/75 15's knocking
a full inch off of my 27&quot; diameter and using 26 as a way to compensate if
he had shorter tires...

Since he didnt mention having a ring and pinion that was different, i
didnt think to calculate that in.  Since he merely said a small nut trans
i assumed one that was more or less stock...

But even with everything being wrong i still cant get it to come out to
4800 at 60...

here is the math for:
tire dia: 26
ring and pinion: 4.37
reductions: 1.39
4th gear: .89

formula: (tire dia X rpm)/(r&amp;p X 4th X redux X 336)=speed
(26*4800)/(4.37*.89*1.39*336)
124800/1816.46

for a result of: 68.7 MPH

as you can see, even with the worst possible combination we can think of
given his tire size, i cant come up with 4800_at_60...

please correct me if i am wrong!

thanks,

Steve
