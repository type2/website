Subject: Re: [VB] Re: [T2] VOA strikes again

In your cards and letters to the VWOA president (does anyone know his
name?) Invite him to add to their web site, an application for use of
the VW logo. Charge a nominal fee of $1, $5, $10. A small cost to VW.
They protect their copyright and everyone is happy. Probably cheaper
than paying the legal staff to chase us.

&gt; The issue is trade mark law - not vw.  The fact is if you don't
protect your
&gt; trade mark you lose it.  If vw isn't diligent in protecting its
trademark it
&gt; will become part of the public domain and anyone will be able to use
it.
&gt; Your problem is with the law of intellectual property your efforts
will be
&gt; better spent complaining to law makers.
