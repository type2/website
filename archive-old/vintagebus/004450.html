Hi,

There is a clock repair shop in Folsom, CA. ( just outside Sacramento.) It
is on the main street with all the restored shops and wooden side walks. The
guys there are really cracker jack and can repair almost any clock. Make
their own replacement gears too. Maybe someone can look these guys up and
post the name and address.

Chris
