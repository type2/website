I met the founder of Simple Shoes in Santa Barbara.  He was driving a
Standard Split (Beetle) with an Okrassa engine.  It was perfect.  I got some
great pictures of it on the side of the road with my former 97 Passat Wagon
in the background.  He invited me to his house to see his collection of
other perfect Volkswagens.  He made several million on the sale, according
to a neighbor who's friends with him.  My neighbor says he loves the VW's,
but his wife likes Porsche's so she has her own collection.  Some first
hand, some second hand info.  Take what you will.




&lt;&lt;I remember about 2 or 3 years ago at the VW classic, the shoe company
&quot;Simple&quot; had their concept  bug - er sorry i mean &quot;new bug&quot;. It had been all
across america and had a cam mounted on the passengers side out the window.
They had the US drawn on the door and put a magnet on each state they had
been thru. Almost had it filled up when i saw it....dont see anything about
it on their site though - although he did sell his shoe company shortly
after that. I heard he bought a 23 window with some of the cash&gt;&gt;
