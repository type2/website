MAtt and list,

I had to go thru this same ordeal in the restoration of my 67. 

The way I and the shop saw the options and what I did follows:

Riveting it back in after painting -
One could place the appropriate length rivets inside the small space with 
the heads inside the slot, along with a metal spacer and some cushioning 
material and then use a vise-type tool and a cushion on the outer 
surface, to squeeze the rivets til they formed their head on the outside 
of the chrome piece.
This was deemed a hassle at the time.

What we did was simply to use two short screws, lockwashers, and nuts. 
Pan heads with the heads out and the washers and nuts inside. The nuts 
may have been thinned down a bit with a grinder, I don't recall, but it 
has worked fine and didn't require stressing the new painted surfaces 
with the squeezing. If I recall, there was adequate clearance inside the 
slot for whatever it is (not near the car now) that needed to live in 
there too.
