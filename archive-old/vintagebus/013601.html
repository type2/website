Hello All,
Can ANYONE shed some light on NEATO/LIMBO.....
I have sent my money and my application over a month ago,and have not heard
a thing back.....When I called I just got a recording that &quot;this number is
NO LONGER in service&quot;.....Are they still around???
or have they gone by way of SOTO(Taking your cash,and well you know the rest)
Jim
