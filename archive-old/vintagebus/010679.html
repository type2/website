Uh Oh!
That means that the NOS slip on connection taillights I bought for my 59' 
Panel are incorrect. I hope the midwest vintage NAZI's don't pop their heads 
in the engine compartment and look at the backside of the corners this 
spring/summer:) I guess I should double what I paid for them and offer them 
up to the e-bay gods (forgive me:))

--Aaah!!! the madness continues

59' panel
