Subject: what's in my garage (like you care)
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

Well, the centerpiece of the garage is DARTHVW a (not
for long) black 21 window deluxe with red beltline and
black deluxe trim (all together now: BLECCCCCHHHH!) Up
in the rafters I've get a set of extra seats (for
sale) and the rear apron, and my NOS visor waiting to
go on.

I figure the NOS visor will rally make it look in top
form.

Also in there are a set of wooden french doors waiting
to go into the 6-foot gaping hole in the back of my
house, and a set of double hung replacement panes for
the front jealousie window they put in in the 50's
(louvers should only be on Westies).

Various makita and Black and Decker tools fill the
workbench on the left (soon to be all metric sockets
and wrenches, etc.) Hanging up is our PASSAT roof rack
for the bikes, and in the corner, a 1977 Bally Evel
Knievel pinball machine (was in  the house in the room
that is now the nursery - reality hits hard) and up in
the rafters is about $8,000 worth of Evel Knievel
toys, collectibles and memorabilia. Anyone want to
trade for a restored double cab?
