It could be a standard sunroof and they just counted wrong.

I Called the guy

He said it's a 21 window.

Lost his steam on the restoration.

Some rust. Bench Seat. Divider removed.
He was burnt out from describing it to people.
So I didn't probe much more.
I plan to take a look at it Sunday if he still has it.
