Hey Paul,

Izzy of safari window fame makes the latch channels too.  I get the 
impression from your post about the ones you found that they are made in 
england.  Izzy is based in socal somewhere.  Not affiliated, never seen them 
before, but you might save a nickel or two on shipping at least!

I believe is the site, but it's not working right now...

there's a link to it on thom's page.

&gt;I just got my new VolksWorld mag yesterday and I
&gt;noticed there is a company reproducing the latch
&gt;sliders that go in the bottom of the front window
&gt;slider area in stainless steel.  Anyone ever seen/use
&gt;these?  Also, I have a pair of these (used, rusted,
&gt;pretty beat up) that are pretty crappy, but I was
&gt;thinking I could restore them back to good use with
&gt;some work.  I have none in my bus now.  If they are
&gt;available as a new repop in stainless, this seems like
&gt;it would be worth it to me.
&gt;
&gt;Not sure how much they are, maybe some of our friends
&gt;across the pond in the UK can enlighten us over here
&gt;in the colonies?
&gt;
&gt;TIA!
&gt;Paul
