I wanna do a full, boring trip report later but just wanted to drop a note
to say how much I enjoyed the trip.  Jim &amp; Paula (&amp; Audrey) Ellis were
excellent hosts, Rachel Hollis was a patient tour guide and introducer at
the show, and I thoroughly enjoyed getting a chance to put faces with
names - John K, JP, Barry, Kerry, Jon (the Albuquerqueans); several great
folks from Hillsboro NM whose names I need reminding of; John H and Ronnie
&amp; the rest of the Havasu gang and plenty more great people -- really
friendly &amp; generous folks all around (I'll say nothing of the all-night
crackhead partyin d**kheads, OK?).

What an event.  Incredible location, great food, cool people,
anthropological studies of the most esoteric variety (I could do a whole
documentary on water-truck behavior).  Highly recommended!
