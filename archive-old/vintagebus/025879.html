In fact, a river does run through it.  

The window frame is designed for water to drip into the hollow of the door.  
Look at the top of  the door w/o frame and the under side of the window 
frame.    This is why they have drain holes at the bottom of the doors, and 
why I like to put a plastic sheeting layer between the door and the door 
panel, tucking the bottom of the plastic into the door.   VW used wax paper 
on the splits there, which doesn't hold up that well after 30+ years.   then 
the water bounces against the door panel, and the panel warps.   Who (some 
listee) said their new door panels warped after a year-  in AZ!  plastic has 
protected panels in the rainy PNW for longer than that.     Or without panel, 
it bounces onto the floor, and your left leg.     This is why Eric Veewee111 
says paint the bottom inside of the door w/ roofing tar, as it does get wet.  
 

(roofing tar is your ally against rust and water)

but I am curious as to how water is kept out when we've all got these felt

channels that like to catch it and introduce it into our windows/doors.
