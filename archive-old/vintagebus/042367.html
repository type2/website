&gt; Hi:
&gt; Thanks for the response.  How about a 66 tranny with 12v option.  Is it the 
&gt; same as 67 one?
Hi,

it may have a 12v sized bellhousing, but i doubt it.  More likely it has a
standard 6v style ring gear with a specailized starter.

It wont however have the highway gearing, it'll be the same as any other
64-66 big nut tranny.

peas,

Steve
