Folks
A little thoughtful troubleshooting will go far here.

On a single circuit system a hose problem will provbably be just affecting
one wheel, a MC problem should be affecting all of the wheels.
On a Dual system with 2 ports being used a MC problem should affect just
the fronts or rears and a brake hose just one wheel.
On a dual system which uses 3 ports (ex 68-69 type MC) If both rears are
affected it should be a MC problem if one rear then a hose. The fronts
although they are on the same  circuit have 2 seperate holes for release
so any combination of problems in the front could be either hose or MC.

Thinking about it a second could save a little trial and error time.
cheers
