My crewcab has a wind howl that I first noticed when
it got cold and I closed all the windows.  I had 
replaced the right front door seal, knowing it leaked 
badly.  In checking closely I found that the cab was
not aligned with the door leaving about a 1/4 inch
gap between the door frame and the cab frame.  

Look for gaps between the doors and the seals.  Use
baby powder on the frame, close the door, and check
to see what area doesn't rub off.  Take a piece of 
stiff paper and run it around the door seal area 
looking for areas of no contact.  This type of leak
is tough to find, and may take a second person to 
check for the sound whilst driving to narrow it down.

Short of some serious body work, I have to install
a tapering shim into an brand new seal.

--------------------------

First let me say thanks for all of the reply 's and
suggestions....
however, let me explain that the wing windows are in
perfect condition and the latches hold the windows
very tight, so tight that the whistle gets quieter as
I start to unlatch. The rubber is like new and seals
great! Still, the noise, the noise
