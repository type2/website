&gt; I have black and gold plates on my 65 and have never had any hassle from
&gt; DMV.  I just pay the thing by mail, no face to face interaction, that's
&gt; the key.  BTW only $34 last year woohoo!!

As long as you already have them, you can keep them forever.  If you lose
one, you'll be stuck with the reflectorized plates.

Another thought is to get a pair of the &quot;Yosemite&quot; plates  (which are
being issued with the old 6-digit letter/number combinations) and repaint 
them black and yellow.
