Subject: non split tranny  boots
Content-type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII
Content-transfer-encoding: 7bit

you know those boots on your swing axle tranny?   How it has that row of
little nuts and bolts holding the split closed?  Well your swing axle tranny
didn't come like that- it came with a boot with no split.   Sometimes seen on
very crusty VWs, and as seen on a swing axle bug tranny someone gave me
(condition unknown, presumed core status)

Well, I liked the idea of putting non split tranny boots on the tranny for my
westy.    I obtained a pair of said boots, which seem D^%n sturdy.
 They would not pry over the end of the axle tube (axles are off) that goes
into the center section, as the flange was to big.   (hot water, to soften
them)   After a bit  I accepted whatthe book said about having the reduction
gear housing removed to put the boots on, though still concerend about the
rubber bumpper mount on the tube, and the brake hose/line clip flange, over
which the tranny boots would have to be stretched.   

I believe the boots were originally put on before all the bits on the tube
were welded on.   Then the tube was painted (notice paint line does not extend
center section wise from where the small end of the boot is).

I cannot press the bits off,   So I called places.  A lot of places.
The results are funny.

#1- I had to explain to the guy what non split boots are, when he understood
he said just go with split boots.  Wouldn't believe they came with non split
boots.   He thought it was a waste of my time/money/energy.   Said they never
came that way either.  (!)

#2- he knew what I meant,  but didn't have the stuff to do them. Said go with
split boots.  

#3 - old crusty German guy with thick accent.   Knew what I meant.  Had done
it, maybe 30 years ago.  Though I should just go with split, but would put the
boots on (both sides) for $150.

Atthis point I am wondering why I am getting this &quot;go for split&quot; pressure.
Perhaps they  are afraid.  Ha!

#4  -  first guy I talked to said sure, check for a price, came back saying no
go, they won't do it.

#5 -   Said they'ld never done it, but they'd try for circa $120.

#6 - sells parts only

#7-   No, won't touch it.

#8 - know what I ment, and why I wanted to do it.  Had done it before (in the
past year)   Said $60.

So, it turned out when I went to Pei at Wolfsberg Motorworks, and said how I
had tried to get it over the flange, he clamped that bad boy axle tube ini a
vice, heated up the boot with an industrial hair dryer type thing, sprayed
some lube and wrestled that boot in place over the axle flange.  It involved
serious pushing and stetching, with his body at a 45o angle pushing hard, but
both of them went on w/o damage, and w/o pressing the reduction gear housing
off.  He changed me less that the quoted price, too.  Guess I could have done
it, if I just used more strength, but I was happy with the outcome.
