&gt;I removed the cancer pods from my heater system last year thinking I 
was
&gt;getting more than my Recommended Daily Allowance of asbestos and I can
&gt;really hear fan/exhaust noise through the heater vents, especially from
&gt;the windshield vents.
&gt;

I remember and want to know more about....VW was replacing asbestos with 
non asbestos heating for free from old busses. Has anyone done this?
