&gt; The only problem is, this book got wet, and alot of the pages are stuck
&gt; together, and have mold. Could I &quot;re-wet&quot; the pages to separate? and
&gt; then hang to dry?
&gt;
First, microwave it to kill any mold, it does not have to be for very long.

From there, it depends how bad it is.  I had a shop manual where about 1-2&quot;
of every edge of every page was stuck together.  I just went real slow and
95% of the pages came apart with no damage.  I didn't do anything to it, no
re-wetting, no magical chemicals, in fact I made sure it was very dry.

Good luck,
Everett
