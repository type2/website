I currently have a dead Diehard battery and was looking to have it

replaced. My question is should I take the one they recommend or will

any 12 volt battery do just fine? This is for my '62 which is a 12 volt

convert. 



I would like to stay with the Sears brands so I can use whats left of my

warrenty for the replacement.



I am just being a cheap bastard or do I really need the one they

recommend?

being cheap myself I refused the Sears' guy's recommendation on the costlier
battery, and got a cheaper one.  (also from Sears, just about the bottom of
the line).    Worked for years.  :)
