The following is based on a '63, a bit different from a '67, I think. 
The U shaped base should be the first part of the rear seat to go in. Use the wingnuts to hold it down to the floor and to the back of the cabin. If you like extra room behind your front seat, put the spare under the rear seat, plenty of room. The bottom seat springs and pad go in next, then the backrest.
