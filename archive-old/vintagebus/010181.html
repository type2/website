Is it possible the sound you describe might be from the vanes in the Judson
'charger?

Haven't fiddled with a Judson for 40+ years, but they do get a bit rattly
with age and wear.

Are you running a lubricator [Marvel Mystery Oil, etc.]?

FWIW.....

&gt;&gt;  Now after a good long jaunt the overheating problem seems to be
non-existant.  But when she is at idle I have an internal engine noise (a
chattering/high pitched rattle) that I did NOT have before that last drive
when I got her prety overheated.  &lt;&lt;
