Just spoke with Ron at the Bus Depot.  There is only one 200 mm clutch disc
through 71. 72 and up are 210 mm.  Thanks for the idea, anyway.  I'm going
to try Sachs tech support in the AM.

&gt;Sounds like you are using a post-71 clutch plate with a 68-70 pressure
&gt;plate. They look very similar to the earlier ones, but the post-71 hub is
&gt;beefier than the 68-70 hubs, which causes it to foul against the pressure
&gt;plate as you discovered. I am sure that if you change to the correct plate
&gt;you will marvel at how light and easy your clutch operation becomes.

&gt;good luck
