Subject: 6 volt voltage regulators

I just recieved a dealers BK stock of 6 volt voltage regulators, these are
New Era brand, made in Japan and are for any 6 volt VW that has the voltage
regulator that bolts in the engine compartment, not on the generator. These
were all misslabled as top of Generator regulators were never relabled to
sell, I have 50 of these.
