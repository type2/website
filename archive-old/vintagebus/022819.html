Subject: Resealing Picture Window?
Mime-Version: 1.0

Hey, does anyone have any tips/tricks to taking apart and resealing the
picture window (looong driver's side wall window) on my 63 Camper?  The
past few storms have shown me how badly it needs a reseal and I currently
have a tarp duct taped to that side to keep water out.  I recall someone
saying there was some grey kind of clay stuff at Orchard I could get to
redo the seals, but nothing past that.
