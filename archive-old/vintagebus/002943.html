Subject: Undercoating Removal


&gt; It just gets better and better.  My current method for removing this stuff
&gt; kicks as*.  What I do is heat a small area with propane torch and scrap
the
&gt; bulk off.  I really only apply heat for a very brief time.   I now have
this
&gt; bottle that I picked up at a gardening store,  I fill it with gasoline and
&gt; pump the handle down which pressurizes the contents.  I spray the area
that
&gt; I scrapped with the pressurized gas and with paint scrapper and steel wool
I
&gt; get all of the remaining goo off - works like a charm.  I keep a hose
&gt; running under my bus to wash the gas away.  And I keep my fire
extinguisher
&gt; close by.  Then I degrease the area by changing the contents of the bottle
&gt; from gas to simple green.  Then I spray with silicon wash, and then with
&gt; metal conditioner  and I hose the whole area off and finally I apply
por-15.
&gt; I did the whole section between my wheel wells and between the inner
rocker
&gt; and  the beam that the I-beams sit on. It only took me about 2 hours to
&gt; remove all of the undercoating.
&gt;
&gt; As I mentioned before this old undercoating did an excellent job of
&gt; protecting my bus - in fact, this undercoating is probably why my bus is
&gt; still around after 40 Canadian years.  But where moisture became trapped
&gt; between the undercoating and the floor the result is some very weak spots.
&gt;
&gt; I realize that por-15'ing my entire engine bay is a bit extreme - oh well,
I
&gt; did it anyway.  I had a bit of trouble figuring out how to apply por-15 to
&gt; those upper areas of the engine bay that are visible through the air
vents.
&gt; There was quite a bit of surface rust in there and I wanted to get it.  So
&gt; what I did was dip a paper towel in a cup of por-15 and reach up in there
&gt; and smear all of the surface with the por-15.  I'm quite sure I got it all
&gt; but since I can't see 100% up there I may have missed a little but I did
&gt; spend extra effort on the seams up there.
