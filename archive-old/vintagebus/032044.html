&lt;&lt; Hey list,
 
 I am attempting to use early heater boxes with the long lever on a later, 
(71) van.  It appears to me that the short lever is just on the opposite side 
of the control box.  How do I get the box apart to flip the lever over?
 Thanks

I dont know if it works that way

either find some bay window heater boxes, or used bug/splitty ones and tye 
the heat on

did you all know the diff between split annd bug heater boxes is the down 
facing lever has two holes an dthe the slightly upper hole is where you 
attach the clip for the bolt for the splitty heat cables.  Using the other 
place wont give you the ability to turn the heat on or off all the way.
