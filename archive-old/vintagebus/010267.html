&gt; All I can say is Wow!  Neat idea.  I've seen the same type of thing, but
&gt; they only tilted the bus 1/2 way.  I've never seen one built as a
&gt; complete cage.  Sort of like those medical head/neck immobilizers.

That is a neat photo!  I would be concerned about the CG and the thing not
wanting to stay where you wanted it to.  Also, I can forsee that there would
be points where the area you want to work on is too high, and rolling it
over one notch would be too low (or vice versa.)  I like the rotisserie way
with it's infinite points of adjustment.

NQ

Sing with me now everyone:  Roll that single cab down to town, roll that
single cab down to town, roll that single cab down to town, so early in the
morning.

(Like the red ball song we all sang in kindegarten.) :-)
