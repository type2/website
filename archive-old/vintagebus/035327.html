okay, here's what the bible says:
58 edition parts list:
*111 415 901  steering damper up to chassis no 20- 117 901
211 415 901 A  steering damper from ch no 20-117 902

the asterix before the first p/n means?  

section 5 page 10-5 in my book is draglink and pitman arm removal .  so far I 
have not seen the steering damper in any of these pics in the steering section

okay p 10-6.  it is located above a tie rod, one end mounting to the body, 
the other to the swing lever 

but let me say that they talk about a washer used from ch no 166 278, and 
recommend retro fitting such washers on buses 20-117 902 through 166 277.  
would hav eto crwl under a bus, but I think the pic is not bd

the pics of the bd suspension on the ground do nothave a clamp on the swing 
lever fo the SD.  I do still think it was an option.  and a good idea.  

I believe this book is updated slightly past BD.   I have seen a few pics of 
post bds in it.

&lt;&lt; E: no steering dampeners on Barndoors. Um, are you
 sure that you are sure or just basing knowledge on
 post 2/55 buses? 
 Checking my Workshop Manual Edition 1954 Section V
 Front Axle and Steering, Page 10-5 describes
 &lt;quote&gt;Steering Dampener Removal and Installation &lt;end
 quote&gt;. I could have *sworn* that there was indeed a
 dampener on the '54 Barnambulator. And no, the front
 end was not a later type as it was impossible to use
 any of the popular &quot;Bus&quot; tow bars. Tubes were too fat.
 Manual makes notes of washer usage for From Chassis No
 166 278 ~blahblah and later mentions Chassis No 20-117
 902- 166 277. I havent bothered to check dates on
 those chassis so please fill me in as the thread goes
 on... &gt;&gt;
