Subject: Re: [VB] westy curtain questions

Wayne, those ends on the shock cord (which I got from
REI) I made using brass tubing from a hobby shop.  I
replicated the originals, as closely as possible, by
flattening the tube slightly, then making the loop of
shock cord and, using a sharp chisel, making the
center indentation.  The originals staked the cord
into the brass by, on the back side, centerpunching
through the brass in a couple places on each cord
(actually through the metal) holding it in place, so I
did the same.

&gt; Hi J.P.
&gt;   Thanks for the pics. That will help alot.  I
&gt; hopefully will have the 
&gt; curtains finished here in a week or two.  The chord
&gt; idea will work great. 
&gt; I'll check Home Depot for some flexible chord and
&gt; some little brackets.
&gt; 
&gt; thanks,
