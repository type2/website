Subject: Eight Annual Mid-Atlantic Holiday Bus Fest: Dec 7

Here's a great opportunity to make a road trip in your splittie, breadloaf,
vanagon or eurovan.  It will be the eighth year of (bravely) opening our
home and driveway to old and new friends spawned from the original
vanagon_at_lenti list and its descendants: 

December 7, 2002 from 1:30 to 5:30pm 
7001 Westmoreland Ave.
Takoma Park MD 
(Inside the Washington DC Beltway just north of the DC/Maryland line- use
Mapquest for excellent, detailed instructions.)
301 270 8073

This is an opportunity to meet your colleagues from the lists face to face,
and share your latest triumph and/or tale of woe, and bring a friend. 

If your significant other avoids bus events, remind him/her that there will
be many others in the same boat commiserating over the money and time lost
on our projects, and catching up on the past years new babies, vacations and
jobs. Half our guests are spouses, children and dogs.  Everyone is welcome,
and everyone has a great time. For some photos of past Mid Atlantic Holiday
Bus Fests, see Tom C.'s site:   http://volksweb.relitech_dot_com/ .

We have a pretty long driveway (twenty buses is the record) and plenty of
street parking as well.  If you are coming from far away, we can accomodate
a camper or two, but please let me know in advance.

You can drop me an email if you think you'll attend so that we can have a
vague idea of numbers, but if your schedule is uncertain, you are welcome to
just drop in. Please bring something to share, and we look forward to seeing
you there!
