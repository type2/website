Jan &amp; I took a break from the SVT Ironbus campout on Saturday and went to the 
antique show at the Cow Palace.
There I lucked out on two items.
The first is a July 55 copy of 'Popular Mechanics', it has a picture of a 55 
bdoor camper with a full roofrack on the front cover and a two page spread on 
a camper conversion available.

The second is October 1958 SCIENCE and MECHANICS.
It has a 5 page test of a 58 deluxe. 
For those that know it says there is a sticker on the windshield that states 
'This vehicle should not be driven over 50 mph' !
I could scan them but feel that this could damage the spines of these old 
magazines.
I will at least scan the covers a put them on my website.
I would feel better to lend them to Everett or Thom if they can scan them 
without damaging the magazines.
