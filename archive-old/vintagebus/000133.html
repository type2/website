I paid 800$ for mine. 100% complete.
My canvas doesnt sound even close to as nice as the one up on ebay. 
Robert davis from santa barbara told me he thought I overpaid.
The reproduction ones sell for 750$ for the canvas alone from PLF.
Derrick Greg was selling the hoops (when they were available) for 400$ a set 
i believe.
I think i got a good deal on mine, no complaints.

There's a single cab canopy FS on ebay right now, starting bid $750

http://cgi.ebay_dot_com/aw-cgi/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&amp;item=227462348

That seems high to me.  Any thoughts?
