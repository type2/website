Subject: RE: [VB] bus roof rack

Thanks for the info Thom, I kinda figured that would be the case. I might
explore some other possibilities for building this rack.

I tried to do that for my trailer, and was informed that getting just
the stanchions was almost as much as the entire rack.

&gt; Hey everyone, I know that the old roof racks are being reproduced for
busses
&gt; and I was wondering if anybody knew where I could get just the arms on the
&gt; top of the rack that secure the bars that go around it. I am building a
&gt; teardrop trailer and need these top legs for a modified kind of roof rack
&gt; that will go on top of this trailer.
