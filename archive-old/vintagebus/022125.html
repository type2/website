&gt;The following M-codes for what I am assuming to be MY '62 Vw bus are as
&gt;follows...help my out and tell me who to register with:
&gt;
&gt;22  10  2

October 22, 1962 production (1963 model year)

&gt;374  081  195

374 is an export code
081 is walk-thru front seats
195 I do not know

&gt;UH 221  BGR  SR  1016654

UH is the port code for Houston/San Antonio, USA, I think
221 is Standard Microbus, Cargo Doors Right, LHD
BGR is Beige Grey upper paint
SR is Sealing Wax Red lower paint
1016654 is the VIN (confirms the bus is 1963 model year)

There *IS* a web page at

http://www.mindspring_dot_com/~deasterw/neato/techdata.htm

that explains how to read the m-code plate and Thom also has a section
on vintagebus_dot_com to with a magic decoder ring if everyone is growing
tired of the m-code descriptions...
