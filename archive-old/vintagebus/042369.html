Subject: looking for dustcaps 55-63 bus.
Message-ID: &lt;Pine.BSF.4.10.10001311551140.29085-100000_at_users.anet-stl_dot_com&gt;

hi all,

I am working buzzily on my 61 bus hoping to have it ready for camping
season in the spring...  Just placed a big-for-me order at busdepot :)

i have found out that the missing dustcaps on my front wheels are a 63 and
older part... and i need em both, they got lost somewhere along hte line
before the bus made its way to me...

so if someone has a pair (one square hole, one no hole) that i could have
cheap/free/trade?? i'd be most appreciative.

If i cant find any soon im gonna give up and put the 67 beam/tranny in
right away...  Everything 63 and older seems to be double to triple the
price as 64-67 :(

i'd like to try the older stuff first though, i hate to change something
without first deciding the original isnt up to my standards. (cant test it
till i get it going, heh)

peas,

Steve

p.s. the pint may be moot, i am unsure of the health of the tranny i have.
