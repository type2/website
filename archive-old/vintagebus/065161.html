Well that an easy one, The next generation of split window owners will 
be the present day bay
window owners. =) -Bryan
---------------------------------
It took me eight years to find a Split Window bus that was worth buying.
I bought it.
As I look through the classifieds at Westfalia_dot_org and Limbo I see
project busses in the $3,000.00 range.
I think that the current pricing is driving many potential buyers away.
I've got my Splittie for sale but I'm beginning to have second thoughts
about selling it.

The 66 Splittie Westy that I bought pretty much had all of the
modifications done to it that I'd consider necessary to have a very good
Splittie, in effect its got the full running gear and front suspension
from a later Bay bus along with much FuFu to make the engine last. It
will run a true 75 mph if you're a brave soul.
Texas market for any type of VW bus is almost non existent and of seven
Vanagon/Westies I've restored and sold, not a single buyer was from
Texas.
I'm 60 years old and I had friends in the early 60s dropping out selling
their Mustangs to buy VW Busses.
Several of them found their way to communes and many just vaporized and I
never heard from them again.
I'm finding a good number of Split Window Busses in Harley Convoys going
down Texas highways and I can only guess that its the Yuppies that are
buying them up.
I don't believe that there is a cap on what you might get from a Yuppie
Doctor, Lawyer, Dentist, Real Estate Broker that wants a Splittie.
Two Attorneys in my neighborhood recently *within a year* bought Bay
Westies at outrageous prices and they pretty much just sit and rot with
very little usage.
I think Splittie Busses, Classic Porsche, Harleys and Old Muscle cars are
the current Yuppie thing to have.
I've had several Yuppie bus owners contact me about building them engines
and after seeing their engines in a box I'm convinced that any engine I
could build for those folks would wind up in a box as well, and long
before the warranty was over with.
The crowd that demands instant gratification don't take much thought of
preventive maintenance, respect for the vehicle or respect for others
sharing their road.
That said ................ I believe that Splitties will be around for a
long time because the Yuppies will spend the big bucks to keep them
running. 
Then there is this .............. Vanagons, Ghias, Splitties is not just
a guy thing, both of the Attorneys I mentioned are Women and the local VW
Club I attend is about 30% Women VW owners.
