&gt; there is a whole bunch more that you will need. make
&gt; sure that you get a distributor drive gear. i don't
&gt; know if they are supposed to come with one, but mine
&gt; didn't.

Mine didn't either, but Ronnie supplied one for a reasonable price.  Be
super-careful to get it oriented correctly the first time you slide it in.
The first one I did was perfect, but on the second I got cocky and put it
in 180 degrees out.  They are a bear to remove without the puller (it was
a Sunday, darnit!)

&gt; as far as the tin, you might as well get new
&gt; tin. it's not that expensive to begin with, plus it's
&gt; shiny to go with your new motor! why put old parts on
&gt; a brand new motor?

I disagree, unless you have a source of NOS VW tin.  The original tin is
vastly superior to the aftermarket stuff commonly available.  It fits
better, has all the little internal vanes that the cooling system needs
and will probably last longer then Taiwan tin.  I tried a pair of
Taiwan cylinder tins once and almost fried an engine.  The Taiwan tin
lacked a small dimple that allowed the flaps to open, which means that 
if I hadn't checked the full travel of the flap lever it would have
jammed closed.  Used OEM cylinder tin will
probably need some minor crack repair where it mounts to the head, but
once repaired it will last forever.

i got mine from cali imports. it
&gt; was $1195, which was the cheapest that i could find.
&gt; RMMW had the exact same motor for $1495 + core. both
&gt; had core charges. try to talk them out of the core
&gt; charge. tell them that you are buying a NEW engine.

Ronnie charged what I consider to be a fair price.  It wasn't the cheapest
quote, but Ronnie's customer service  was most helpful and there wasn't
any BS about core engines.

Apparently, there are different levels of quality in the Mexican engines
currently being imported.  Both of mine came in original VW cartons and
strapped to a pallet.  The GEX (Beetlemex) engines apparently come in a
different way.

Cheapest isn't always best.
