Hi Ken,
We got our phosphoric acid from a local chemical supply company.  You can get 
Naval Jelly which is in a jellied form from your local hardware store.

Either works and cleans out corrosion in places you really can not get into 
with sand paper!  Though the non-jellied does get in there abit easier.   Which 
in turn helps when you solder the brass clips in the fuse box together.
