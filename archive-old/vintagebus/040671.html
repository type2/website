Yeah John I'll have to join you on the hippie issue although I don't have
any Grateful Dead stickers on my bus. I am looking for a 'Make Love, not
War&quot; sticker, if you know where I can get one let me know :) Actually, I get
a lot of people giving me the peace sign...it's kind of cool. I forgot what
it was like to be a hippie.

Stay cool,
