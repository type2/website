Where can you get 63 and earlier link pins?? I have 6 NOS ones and would

really like to find some more before my supply is gone! I can get new king

pins on a limited basis for 63 and down, new link pins for 64 and later, no

king pins for 64 and above though.

oh, well last time I checked (which was probably 5 or so years ago) they were 
still available new.    Then again, it is  possible to get good used ones out 
of 55-63, easier than finding them if they were bd only.  I have a set of NOS 
linkpins if I need to redo my bd, but as it is not something I use on a 
regular basis I haven't been up on the supply.      Thanks for letting us 
know about the lack of new 63 and back link pins.  what do you sell the 64-67 
link pins for?
