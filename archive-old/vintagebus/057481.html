&gt; A search on Google for &quot;infrared thermometers&quot; will return several thousand links.

&gt; Here's a link to an article titled &quot;Infrared Thermometer Selection Basics&quot;.

&gt; The lowest price I found by following links on the 1st Google search page was $76.95 for a unit with Laser sighting, or $64.95 without Laser sighting.  These were on the RAYTEK site at:

The laser sight thing is pretty much a gimmick, as the actual area
measured is very large relative to the laser spot.  You can get the
impression that you are getting a more specific measurement than you
think!
