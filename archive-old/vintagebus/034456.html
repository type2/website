&lt;&lt; If no, how do you figure out the correct shade of gray?  Or is that too

Hi Everett,
Find a completely wrecked panel and cut out a chunk that shows the interior 
gray.  Then have your local paint shop try to match it not only for color, 
but it's semi-gloss finish.  When you get a good mix of paint that does the 
job please tell us the mixing codes!      Eric&amp;Barb
