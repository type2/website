Hi J.P.

That was one of the Best Campout / shows *I* have been to,,, really worth the
1948 miles to get there!!
I wish I could make it this year, but I am sure going to try again next year.

I saw that VW Trends Nov 2001 pg 8 has a small blurb!

&gt; Our website is down, but we're up for Busses and
&gt; Ballons V.  On October 5th and 6th, during the
&gt; Albuquerque International Balloon Fiesta, we're having
&gt; the fifth edition of Busses and Balloons!  The FAA
&gt; lifted the restriction on lighter-that-air flights, so
&gt; the Fiesta is on!
&gt; 
&gt; Check it out: camping Friday and Saturday night, a car
&gt; show Saturday with a FREE lunch for all from our
&gt; sponsor Foreign Aide and raffles, awards, and all the
&gt; usual, plus a great time around my campfire.  P-mail
&gt; me for a copy of the flyer.  Hope to see you there.
