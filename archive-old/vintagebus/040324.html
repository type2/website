If the driver's side trailing arm comes
off you could try pulling on the passengers side
arm to see if you can pull it out with
torsion leaves attached.  You can't really bash too much
on the end of the torsion leaves (exposed if drivers side 
trailing arm comes off) cos you will probably 'spread' them and
them you'll never be able to pull them through
the beam (the fitting in the middle they pass through
is quite tight.  You could try gently to see how 'firm'
things feel......

But I don't think it will work.  The fact the passengers
side wont move suggests the trailing arm is surrounded
by crap and stuck to the inside of the beam.  You need a 
penetrant rather than grease. If the drivers arm comes off
you could put the beam on its end and pour penetrant
in .....might be problemetic now its full of grease.

You might have to drill a couple of holes closer to the stuck end
and and try and introduce some penetrant there.  You could
always pull the zerk (grease) fittings and try and squirt
some in through those holes.  Squirt penentrant in every night for 
a week ot two and then see what happens by gently tapping on the other end.

--&gt; So, what are you going to do, Thom?  

Well, last night I removed all of the little set-bolts, boths sides and the
middle.

The driver's side moves fine, the passenger side won't.

I greased everything  up - went thru 1 1/2 tubes of grease.

I tried removing the trailing arm, no joy.  Won't budge.  Didn't try
removing
the driver's one yet.  Can you remove the one side and then pound thru
the opposite side?

I tried heating it with a torch, didn't make any difference.

&gt; If your trailing arms break, I might have a spare set of barndoor ones,
but I 
&gt; could be wrong.  Need to look at my spindle pile as the upper left king
pin 
&gt; bushing area is worn on my 65, and getting annoying, time to see if I have
a 
&gt; decent used left 64-67 spindle.

I imagine LHD and RHD trailing arms are the same.

&gt; so, I guess you might have to find that wrong hand drive BD n the pick and

&gt; pull,?

Missed it!  When I got to the junkyard yesterday, Elvis and Jimmy Hoffa were
loading it on a trailer...
