Question 3:
It's obviously guilt!  8-)


Question 1.

You can buy 'hybrid' cables from Wolfsburg West that cover
just about all combinations of year and tranny.  So they can
sell you a cable right off the shelf that will you your big nut
in a 63....

A little pricey though - I think I paid around US $50 - $55 dollars
per cable a couple of years ago for cables to suit a pre 60 bus with
a big nut tranny.

&gt; Question 1:
&gt; Is there a cable that fits without fabbing/welding the missing bowden
&gt; retaining brackets to the inner whl wells? Do I have to ask the Bro-inlaws
&gt; to weld in the brackets? (Seems 'kinda' easy fix).
&gt; Question 2:
&gt; Is anyone in the process of cutting up a 64-67 bus who could easily
&gt; hack/save the L/R brackets?
&gt; Question 3:
&gt; Why in the hell am I awake at 02:20 AM???
