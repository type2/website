&gt; More info on that
&gt; bus was in my response to the Pearl Harbor post.I know
&gt; wrong list but someone might know someone....

&gt; 69 Westy It's red and has seen much
&gt; better days.But it can be had for under 500
&gt; bucks....If I had to guess a price.The dude wants to
&gt; get it sold.It has a rebuilt 16?? in it...some 10,000
&gt; miles ago with parts missing and or broken 
&gt; The front axle is busted and..... well you get the point.

yes we do.

broken 
parts missing

_at_ $500 this is not cheap and certainly not free.

in 1997 I picked up a running westy for $400 in the south bay (CA)
gave it a break job, tune up &amp; grease job drove it Xcountry
and lived in it for 2 semesters. traded it for a mt. bike.

beat that

but then i'm a whore for splitys 
I paid ten times for my heart breaking 61 kombi what i did for the 69

now the only thing i can afford is a * really * free bay window

you don't know what you got till it's gone...

aloha
