&lt;&lt; Many thanks to all respondents on the cross shaft issue in my (OTP) 71 
 westy (which seems to have a 68-70 tranny).  FLAPS had a super beefy cross 
shaft in stock, under $10. &gt;&gt;

Hi Joe,
You are welcome!  Make sure the cross shaft forks hold the throw out bearing 
equal side to side in relation to the tranny input shaft.  If not, the throw 
out bearing will be shoved side to side and wear out a set of forks of a 
cross shaft PDQ.  To the point the throw out bearing clips pop off the forks 
due to lack of spring tension.  If  the throw out bearing is off center a 
tiny bit you can slightly bend the forks, but make darned sure that the throw 
out bearing can still slide a little side to side on the forks to self center 
itself perfectly.  If the forks are off 1/32&quot; or more then best to buy 
washer/s to act as shim/s on the left side of the cross shaft just to the 
right of the left bushing.  If you do not use shim/s when the forks are way 
too off center and instead bend the arms too much you will begin to raise the 
throw out bearing too high out of center!  Beware those plastic bushings that 
go into the tranny case to support the left side of the cross shaft.  They 
allow too much flex of the cross shaft to the front and rear.  Best to look 
for solid bushing of brass or bronze instead.
