&lt;&lt; Hi again!
 The PO converted my 66 6V to 12V generator.  It doesn't appear that any
 of the electrical system (except coil, regulator, etc.) are switched and
 I don't find any step downs.  Everything is stripped from the rig.  How
 can this be?  I don't understand how all this stuff can still run (like
 lights) with 6V bulbs...
 
 As I move to re-assemble, I would like to go to an alternator for better
 electrical efficiency.
 
 Knowing that Everything is out, I am going to an alternator, and I can
 replace things easily, what should I put in as 12V?
  &gt;&gt;

all light bulbs should be 12V, headlights, running lights, taillights,  many 
people omit to change the bulbs in the dash/speedo.  And the dome lights.   
using 6V bulbs will melt the dome covers when run on 12V.  get 5W12V bulbs, 
10W12V bulbs will also melt covers.   

wire in a voltage drop for your wiper motor

leave the 6V horn alone.   I purposely run 6V horn with 12V, it is very loud 
and obnoxious, makes people wake up when they act like they will run into me, 
saved me from a couple accidents that would have happened from others not 
paying attention.

either your should have a 12V starter with 12V FW, or a 6V starter on a 6V FW 
w/ 12V solenoid

I wouldn't get rid of a perfectly fine generator.  But if you do, you can 
send it to me :)

Clara
