Subject: RE: [VB] VW  Hippie Bashing

I don't think any body on this list makes real malice statements...
there are certain threads and pet peeves that go on here, but you have
to learn to live with some of it, like lowered busses, something that
gets everyone's dander up but I bet we can count quite a number of list
members that have lowered or would like to lower their bus, there's
probably even a *hippy* on this list with a lowered bus...  And then
there is that fruit cake that always is looking for original gas tank
divider felts... we're definitely a diverse group that nonetheless seems
to all get along and help one another.   

Good, bad, and ugly, I still wouldn't want to be anywhere else!

this list is disappointing-perhaps an IQ test is necessary. I just want 
to talk volkswagen.  Why are there so many time wasters here.
what the hell is a hippie-
somewhere in my life I learned that people are all individuals.....But 
they tend to belong to some group. They find comfort in being part of a 
group. Parents, conservative, hippy, gay, bikers, back pain sufferers 
etc. and of course we become more secure by saying bad things about 
those others. just like in high school!!!!!!!!
you know they had a honda to hit with a sledge hammer at the volkswagen 
show this week end.
