&lt;&lt; Question is what should I do for the newly sandblasted backing plates?  I 
figured I have three options: Powder coating, Zinc primed and rattle-canned, 
or POR-15.  (What color?   &gt;&gt;
Hi Paul,
We have our backing plates and other black pieces of suspension and steering 
stuff zinc primer powder coated (Marine usage = salt!) and then have these 
items semi gloss black to 80% gloss.  Which seems to be right on the money 
for both color and gloss for any and all small black VW parts/tin.  For 
powder coating best to just degrease the items and let your powder coater 
sand blast them.  Otherwise your parts sit and rust while waiting for thier 
turn.   Eric&amp;Barb
