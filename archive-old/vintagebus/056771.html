&lt;&lt; Upon suspension articulation, such as turning and acedning a steep hill
 at a stolight, the driver side of my bus creaks some, like the torsion
 arm/bar is flexing audibly almost. No noises from tunring noramlly, so I
 doubt the trans (also is new) is suspect. Is this the norm, or what
 should I check first off? Bus is due to get rear nuts checked, spring
 plate bolts checked fine yesterday, and I must tighten my lower shock
 bolts some.

not sure what some of the words there were, but if the squeak is coming from 
the front suspension, I would thoughroughly grease it.   Make sure new grease 
comes out , not just old grease, especially on the beam, which can take a 
while.   get all 4 fittings on each spindle, and get the swing lever and if 
you have anyfittings on the tie rods or drag link get those.  Adjust the 
links while you have it up in the air (really easy, you need two 17mm 
wrenches and maybe a screwdriver to knock some crud off- the procedure is in 
the idiot book).  check for play in the king pins.  Might as well adjust the 
brakes while it's in the air.

Greased my 61 yesterday, it hadn't been that many miles as it hasn't been on 
any trips since Yakima in September, but it needed grease.  helps keep those 
expensive king pins from wearing out is the idea.   After you grease it every 
3K tuneup for a few years, the grease that first comes out will be thick and 
clean.   The old grease is thinner and dirty.

Maybe it won't help your problem, but it might and it certainly won't hurt 
the bus.
