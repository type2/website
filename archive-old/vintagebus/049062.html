I posted the truck bumper pics in the Gallery on www.vintagebus_dot_com .   Have at it, I don't know what year the truck was, but it has outie louvers and fried egg turn signals. The DC is in the Seattle area, bought by a guy who flew down to this S*T* meet, 11/98 in Madera, CA. PO by a Fresno guy. All the tin and suspension was cad plated!
