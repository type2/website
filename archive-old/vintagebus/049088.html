Subject: Tire pressures?!?  

  Does everyone out there run the recommended tire pressures? I believe it is 
18lbs in front and 23 in the rear.  

I'm not sure about the front &amp; back tires, but the spare tire -

Try NO PRESSURE in the spare tire - why? you ask? How?

Its simple: The only thing you really need to do is install a new radio 
under the dashboard. The under-dash stereo box for aftermarket installation 
works well. Decide where you want to mount it, I recommend under the Left 
side of the glovebox - and mark where you want to drill the holes. Drill 
holes. Drill one hole right through the spare tire that you forgot was in 
the trunk. If you hear a hissing sound and the metal bits from drilling 
blow back in your face, you have had success.
Congratulations! Set drill down. Put one hand on hip, scratch head with 
other hand. Scratch your beard. Sigh. Go have a beer (I recommend BASS 
Ale), contemplate your stupidity...

Not that I did this, and it wasn't really funny, either.

I didn't like that spare tire anyhow.

Anybody want to buy it? It's the biproduct of the actions of a complete 
moron...

(I normally wouldn't admit this, but the story was too good to pass off - I 
told Joe the other night, and he just laughed at me.. a lot. I was looking 
for a little consolation - can't you tell I'm in turmoil here?)

Ok then.. carry on.

Have a great day - see those of you who are going, in Norwalk, CT on the 4th 
of June!

I appreciated the story of mounting the underdash radio and drilling into
the forgotten spare tire.  It took me back to the time that I was preparing
to mount a nifty high performance coil on the fan shroud just to the left of
the single carb (as you look in from the rear).  Marked my holes for
drilling and plunged that drill right in.  My great job was met with an ooze
of oil seeping out one of the holes - the oil cooler didn't get out of the
way fast enough!
