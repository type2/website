That would be me.  I cleaned the springs in the driver's seat and
learned not to clean the rest of them.  I would assess the &quot;stuff&quot; as
more waxy than greasy and sprayed on to quiet the springs.  Hose them
down to get the big stuff off, but leave them waxy or hear about it
every time you sit down.
