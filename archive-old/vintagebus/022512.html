Subject: Improved Wiring Diagram Page

I incapacitated myself last Satuday night playing volleyball, and since I
won't be able to walk normally for a while (imaging twisting your femur
apart from your tibia... now you've almost got it...) I decided to clean up
some longstanding issues.

High on the list was the wiring diagram page.  It's now a table with links
to all the diagrams.  Gone are the cryptic thumbnails, and the page loads
in 5 seconds rather than 5 minutes!

I'm still on the hunt for diagrams though, and *any* air-cooled VW!  Take a
look at the page, and if you have one that I don't, please scan it and send
it to me, in as high of a resolution as possible, jpeg or tiff is fine.
