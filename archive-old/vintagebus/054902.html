&lt;&lt; Try driving a bus every day for a month and a half, then
 climbing behind the wheel of a 3.6L 2700lb 911!

 &gt; after riding and driving buses for the last couple of weeks i got in one 
of my beetles to run some errands.  it was like getting into a rocket ship!  
it's fast, handles well, accelerates like no one's business and can still 
stop on a dime.  i think everybody here needs to go out and get on of the 
small fast volkswagens.  if you have one but it's not running, what the heck 
is that about?  &lt;grin&gt;

I have also been driving my bus as a daily driver for the last 2+ months. My 
944 Turbo race car is coming out of the shop next week and will again be my 
daily driver. ~3000lbs, &gt;&gt;250 hp, wide tires, race seat, roll bar, 5 point 
seat belts. I can't wait for my rocket ship back.
