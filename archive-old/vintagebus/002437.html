Hi Volks, sorry to say I just received word from Tim Bernsau,
 Editor of VW Classics, that there will NOT be a second
 edition. So if you are a collector of VW &quot;stuff&quot; like me, find
 yourself a copy to save and put away.  Of course my 67 bug
 was to be in the second edition, I was that close! 
Bus content, it's 111* degrees out today so maybe I'll just
clean the garage up to be ready to assemble the motor when
I have all the parts.

P.S.Saturday I took 94 pictures of Ronnies barndoor, &quot;your a
better man then I Gunga Din&quot;
