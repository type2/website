&lt;&lt; Yes, but rare isn't always desireable.  Ameobic dysentery is rare, but
 I'm not sure I'd want it... &gt;&gt;

Taylor wasn't necessarily saying his was more desirable, just rare as in less 
common. Besides Taylor's camper I saw less than a dozen &quot;brand X&quot; campers at 
BOR.  There were at least a 100 Westy's, most of which were the SO-42. After 
a while it's &quot;Yawn, another SO-42&quot;  
Some of those old companies build some camper kits that were cheap and 
flimsy, but they are often more interesting than the Westy.
