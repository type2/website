Hello All,
 It's me again!  I found out (via Mr. John Muir) that I had a dead coil, causing my 66 bus not to start. So Muir writes that I can replace it with any coil as long as the voltage is correct!! This I did, I took the coil off my '75 (the '66 has been converted to 12 volt, I double checked the bottom of the coil and it said 12 V).  On my short maiden voyage, I smelled something burning and found that I had completely fried EVERY wire associated with the coil except the big one going to distributor.  Did I do simething wrong? was Muir wrong when he wrote that I could use any coil? HEEELLLLLLLLLP!



Peace, John Baker
