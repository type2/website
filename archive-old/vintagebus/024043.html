&gt; Been attempting to bleed brakes on my '67.
snip
&gt; I noticed that if I push really hard on the pedal,
&gt; it gives gets really hard.  If I back off on the pressure,
&gt; I can get the pedal to move and continue bleeding.
&gt; 
&gt; I bled all wheels, checked adjustments &amp; all OK.
&gt; Sat in it last and tried brakes.  Pushing hard results
&gt; in stiff feeling brakes.  Letting off a little results in
&gt; brake pedal going down easily.  Pumping brakes
&gt; results in stiff brakes again.

My money says flex lines. They are the wild variable in an otherwise
straight-forward system.
