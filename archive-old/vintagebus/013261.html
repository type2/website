Hi Brian
I am soo glad you had a great time ,as I did, at VWoA!
Thanks for the trip report, mine is at 
www.globalserve_dot_net/~jrivers/AuburnHills99.htm
Too bad your scared to cross the boarder into CANADA! &lt;big grin&gt;
Let me tell you that We have a place on EVERY corner that sells your 
favorite breakfast!  TIM HORTON'S DONUT (and Orange juice store)
AND ... you can buy them here for about 2/3rds the price you pay in the U S 
of A
The gas will cost you more, dangit but we don't have toll roads.
So ? What are you doing in Aug 7 ?  Come to the Show at Grand Bend, spend a 
few days on the Beach, and as long as you've cleaned out your cooler you can 
spend a few days here! hahaha seeing the horse and buggies etc. and then 
head to the BIG City and catch the Great Canadian VW show in Toronto the 
next weekend, 15th. There is the new, nude beach, there that may interest 
you , but you can't leave YOUR pants around your ankles,, that is not cool!
Sounds like a great thing for a guy looking for Really Good Egg-Salad, we'll 
make sure you get some, just before you leave!  &lt;grin&gt;
:-)
If i don't see you in the future, it was fun meeting you in the pasture!
Later
Jamie Rivers
Ontario CANADA
PS. watch out for moose, but if you can get me some DEER repelant that is 
effective in NY and PA , I'd love some!

&gt;
&gt;So Sunday, the day of the show, I am awakened bright and early by the sound
&gt;of Woody's 64 Kombi being fired up to transport him, Crusty and Matt off to
&gt;the show to scam up on the early-bird swap meet deals.   It must have been
&gt;around 6AM or so, and raining, so I just slithered back down into the bed
&gt;and went back to sleep

snip
&gt;and set off with the cam-corder.  One of the 1st people I ran into was 
&gt;Jamie
&gt;Rivers, from that country up north where things are a lot more expensive.
&gt;We caught up an things since 'Everybus' and walked about the show together.
&gt;I also ran into another guy from that country up north were they sell ham 
&gt;as
&gt;'bacon' that I knew from Busses on the Blue Ridge.  The cars there were 
&gt;pretty darned kewl.  There was a lot of awesome stuff
&gt;that you never get to see in the shows around St. Louis.  There was more
&gt;split-oval Beetles there than you can shake a crank-start handle at.  I 
&gt;even
&gt;got to see a Kubelwagen and Schwimwagen in person for the 1st time in my
&gt;life! There was also a lot of busses I hadn't seen before, including a few
&gt;flip-seat campers.
, snip
I
&gt;elected NOT to swing up in to Canada for fear of being trampled by a moose


&gt;I will definitely be trying to go back next year, and hopefully the big 
&gt;beer
&gt;and BBQ bash will be held again....  But even without, it's well worth the
&gt;trip.  I'll even bring along some Moose-Repellant so I can go to Canada!
&gt;-Brian
&gt;&quot;Unemployment Tour '99, and the Search for a Really Good Egg-Salad.&quot;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Tune in next time, when we talk about a bunch of bus people getting 
&gt;together
&gt;to do nothing!
