My .02...

I have had &quot;Jupiter&quot; brand? tires on my Vanagon for years, and intend to put
them on both splitties, if I ever get them on the road again.  They come in
6 and 8-ply (that I know of), cost about $100/pair installed, last a long
time and feel like a dream on the road.  I highly recommend these tires.  I
don't, however, know of any limitation on the choice when it comes to sizes.

Call up your nearest Big O Tire place...that's where I got mine.

Gene
