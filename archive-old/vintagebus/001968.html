Special thanks to Terry, Erin and Rob for organizing a successful camping
event.  The magnetic stickers that Erin gave out and the T-shirt Iron ons
that Terry shared really set of the &quot;Now that design looks cool!&quot; triggers
in my brain.  &quot;How do make a VW bus even cooler?&quot;, ad Kocapella playing his
flute out the top.  It was wonderful to see so many of the Iconic VW buses
together in the natural beauty of the tree covered bluffs and canyons over
looking the Mighty Mo. Meeting all these different years of buses together
afforded the opportunity to see the differences in conversions, windows and
trim from year to year. It's amazing that so many people can drive
essentially the same type vehicle, yet they are all unique. I was lucky
enough to be at the end of the line when they took the ride through the pass
and it was truly beautiful to see all those buses in front of me winding
through the trees.      This was my last camp of the season and the best.
Can't wait 'til next year.
