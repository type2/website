Stephen,

If you are using any type of modern paint system that uses isocyinates (if you
don't know...find out from your supplier!) you should absolutely use a
supplied air breathing system that pumps fresh air to a mask or hood.  Since
you stated that you have a beard, I would suggest getting a hood.  The pump
pushes the air through a tube to the back of the hood and the positive
pressure keeps all the nasty stuff out .  Check out
http://www.autobodystore_dot_com .  They sell a few different systems.  The Hobby
Air is the least expensive and runs around $250 I think.

&gt; hello all,
&gt;
&gt; I am getting to a point where i am going to need to do some
&gt; priming/painting on my bus before too long.
&gt;
&gt; Before i have always used a standard canister respirator, but you cant use
&gt; one of those with a beard the instructions say, it wont seal right.
&gt;
&gt; I now have a beard and dont really want to remove it, but i dont want to
&gt; destroy my lungs either...
&gt;
&gt; any of you other bus-nuts bearded and have a solution for this dilemma?
&gt;
&gt; thanks,
&gt;
