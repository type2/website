Hi
Well for me it is always about the math if the bus had only 65,000 on it that
would be an average of 1765 miles a year assuming it was running the whole
time not likely.
even at 165,000 it just 4560 miles a year still pretty amazing. The other
thing is that with only 65,000 miles it would most likely still have its
original motor, the interior would be still in good shape. I've seen original
low mileage cars and even in the Northeast they have a special look.
good luck
let me know how you make out

pete 66 ( might me 265,000) ?
