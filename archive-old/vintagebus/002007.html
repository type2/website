All,
    I have replaced the leaking front seal and leaked-on clutch plate. First
time off with the flywheel. I heard much about how bad a day I was going to
have. I did it on my own in preparation for when I will have to do it on the
side of the road. Two pics up on flywheel and front seal removal.
