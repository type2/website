&lt;&lt; It says on the web site that they only fit bays but I
dont see what is the huge difference between a split

I'm not the expert, but I suspect your are correct.

Could there possibly be a difference in the hinges betwwen the years?

My only concern would be if the bays can somehow support the weight and not 
the earlier models.
