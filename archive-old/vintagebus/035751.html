55-58 sand green/palm green color combo the &quot;palm green&quot; (L312) was on top 
and the &quot;sand green&quot; (L311) was on bottom.
They used the L311/sand green throughout the interior.
On passenger cars, they had two toned rims, bumpers, and also included 
factory pinstriping.
The rims had palm green along the outter edge and sand green on the inner 
section. They were black on the back. 
The bumpers were painted entirely sand green and the &quot;inserts&quot; were painted 
palm green.
On westfalia models they did not feature two toned rims or the pinstriping.

&lt;&lt;I thought the Sand Green was always on the upper half of the bus? If you
want to send me a picture of your bus I can do the color changes in
Photoshop and send it back to you. I did this for my Crew Cab. I can
also add in whatever wheels you would like etc...
