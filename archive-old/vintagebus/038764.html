&gt; single heavy duty valve springs&lt;
&gt;If you're not planning on running high RPMs, you don't need these.&lt;

Without a tach it's REAL EASY to float the valves before you grab your next
gear, especially first.

&gt;If you aren't running high RPMs and the requisite stiff valve springs, the
stock shaft/rocker/adjuster will do fine.

After 30 years of work hardening and wear, those clips have a tendency to
break. Happened to me twice on the same engine. Stock springs just barely
cut the mustard for a bus and HD singles aren't going to kill your drive
train. Solid rockers are a snap to put together; ratio rockers are a
different animal and from what I hear, need a little more attention to
setup.

&gt;It's a religious argument, but the stock points are pretty darned reliable and
don't tend to die in unfixable ways like the electronic gizmos.&lt;

Nothing says fun like filing/adjusting a set of points every month and
having your timing go out when the block wears down. I've had my electronic
gizmo in place for five years with no problems. Set it and forget it. Keep a
set of points in your tool box if/when the gizmo breaks.

&gt;The HP-1 filter is a good idea unless you make provisions for a pressure
bipass.&lt;

Full flow is always a good idea and not just for race engines. I'm not
running a pressure bypass cover. Someday I'll probably get one. I change my
oil to a thinner weight in winter and haven't popped a filter because of it.

&gt;Myself, I just change oil at reasonable intervals.&lt;

Changing the oil often won't stop those chunks from getting past that screen
door in your sump and into the bearings.

---

Like I said in my original post, whatever tickles your fancy. If your bus is
a beauty queen, then by all means, keep it absolutely stock. I offered
suggestions based on my experience because if you get a wild hair up your
butt for dual carbs, (like I did) your drive train will be prepared for it.
That's the great feature about this list, nobody can agree on any one thing
and it's like a buffet, just pick and choose what looks good.

YMMV, MHO, BTDT and respectfully submitted,
