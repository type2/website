$25 a wheel is what I have settled on. The range is from surface rust and dirty to primered in DP40 and painted black. Hubcap clips vary widely. Any wheels that I would sell have no curb damage and appear round. They all would restore beautifully. I have some interest but no definite sales yet. So let me know. I do need to
check on shipping for one person and hope to do that today. Has anyone discovered the difference in crows foot and non crows foot rims? Were they just different suppliers?
thanks
