Hi,

Why are you guys bothering with dropping resistors on your wiper motors? I
have been running a 6V motor on a 12V system for over 20 year and no
problems. The wipers work absolutely Great!!!!!!! No more anemic/slow wipers
in a downpour. Just run the motor as it is. At the higher speed the motor
develops a higher back voltage so that its apparent running voltage is not
that high.

Chris
