There is only one bus at my home. But hidden away (not by me) in a
nearby orchard are two more busses, two squarebacks, one fastback,
half-a-dozen bugs, and two of those biker trikes built out of VWs. Oh,
and a couple of Porsches too. Something fishy is going on there but I
don't know what. Best not to get shot at trying to find out.
