Lousy show.  Lots of pierced nipples, not enough cars, and definitely not
enough barndoor parts :(

Big score of the day was the correct turn signal switch for my '55 westy. $20.

I was on the lookout for parts for various people, but nothing really good
showed up.  Tried to find a crank and handle for eric s; one guy had a
crank and nut for $125.  Not today...  Another guy had an NOS
mirror/spotligt, $1000.  Saw it two years ago at the classic for the same
price.  Gotta pay the rent somehow, I guess.  I wonder how many swaps he
has to travel to and pay admission until it's not even worth it to sell it
anymore.

Overall, a disappointing turnout.  Mechanically, I was bummin' 'cause it
appears I blew out the rear transmission seal.  I just replaced a broken
pressure plate two weeks ago!  Anyone wanna buy a bus, cheap?
