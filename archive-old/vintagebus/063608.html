    Since everyone has been talking about engines lately what would
 be a good size engine for a bus that needs to climb hills back and forth
 from work each day. I have a 50 mile trip each day and my 1600dp doesn't
 cut it with the grade and other hills I need to climb. I was thinking
 something like a 1776 or 1914 dual port engine with a pict 34 or baby
 dell's. Also who would be a good engine builder?
 
 
 Thanks for your time

Barry Blythe or David O'bannion at Blythe Enterprises, 3209 Shiloh Road, 
Suite N,
Garland, Texas Phone: 972-333-5063 would be the right fellows to talk to. 
Either can do the job. Barry excels in larger engines  for VW applications. 
David has installed a 1914 cc in a McClela kit car that I know of. The 1914 
cc is some stout engine for a sports car. It has dual carbs and will put wind 
in tour sails.
