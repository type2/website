The new WW ones are thinner than the original.  Gimme a real OG one anyday.   
I didn't see any deluxe trim on it, but if it was powdercoated as they said I 
dont think they are too out of line, really.  THough why not straighten the 
uprights first?  The blade looked pretty straight, and so did the tube.  How 
much does it cost to get a bumper powdercoated?
