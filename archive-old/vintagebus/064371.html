Subject: Barndoor Camping Book on E-Bay

http://cgi.ebay_dot_com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&amp;item=725059565

Just watching this one on E-Bay and have no interest in this. Like barndoors, but don't have the $$ to play in that league and have to settle for those newer '60s models. Looked yesterday and could swear I saw a bid of $301, but that appears to have changed to the current $62. Not sure what happened there. Just interested in seeing what develops...
