Howdy Volks,

Archive update on http://www.type2_dot_com/ web site...

Over the past 10 days there have been periods where odd &quot;Access Denied&quot; and
other errors have appeared on the archives.

As of this morning, I believe everything is working great and there should
be no problems.  We completed the move to the new Internet site / connection
this morning and are operating with great response time and performance.

If you have any problems, please e-mail me at SGutknecht_at_i405_dot_com ...

I do have all the messages in up to November 22, 1999.  If you can't find a
message you are looking for, please e-mail me!  I believe we have a total of
133,481 messages!

Thanks

  Stephen Gutknecht
  Renton, Washington
