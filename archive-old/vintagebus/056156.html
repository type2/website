Subject: Re: [VB] hazetguy's strange engine trouble

You might me thinking of how a FI engine works. On a FI engine, there are
only 2 fuel injection cycles. Cylinders 2 and 4 recieve fuel at the same
time and then cylinders 1 and 3 receive fuel.

One of the cylinders in each cycle receive fuel at the end of the exaust
stroke instead of the beginning intake stroke as would be expected.

&gt; all this reminds me of the theory i once heard:
&gt; basically the theory goes that at idle a vw engine only fires on the
front(?) two cylinders.  once under load, all four fire normally.  if i
remember correctly, the person responsible for this theory was,
figuratively, ripped to shreds.
&gt;
&gt; anyone else hear this theory or something similar?  this might be better
on friday unless that is what hazetguy is experiencing with his engine....
