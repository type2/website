Hi list.

I'm getting ready to hook-up the heater on DARTHVW and
I need a couple of parts/advice.

I need the &quot;breastplate&quot; engine tin, the one closest
to the bumper, which the heater hoses pass through.

I noticed on busses at shows, the tin has a raised
portion which covers half of each heat riser exit, and
a smaller piece covers the other half.
The only breastplate tin I could find in the rags and
some on-line places had cut-outs for heat risers, not
the raised part with the extra piece.

Has anyone out there got this piece(s) they want to
let go of for some $$?

Also, I have the rubber flanges and short 3&quot; tubes
which pass the heater hose through the tin, what
connects it to the &quot;egg-shaped&quot; pod on the muffler,
then what connects the bottom exit of that egg-shaped
pod to the heater box? They don't fit together (about
1&quot; or more apart), so I imagine there's a stub or
something?
