Subject: stock distributor part # (65 Samba)
To: type2 &lt;vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com&gt;

First Question,

does anyone know what the stock distributor for a 1965
Deluxe bus would have been?  The motor would have been
a 1500 with a rev limiter.

Second, Anyone have one FS?

third, will it make a difference if i run it on a 1600
engine?

thanks
MAtthew
