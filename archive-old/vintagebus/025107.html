&gt; The real deal stuff to use is PC-11, which is available at at good
&gt; hardware store.  That's what the pros use.

I have used both cheap stuff and PC-7.  (Probably a pre to PC-11)  Don't waist your
time with the cheap stuff.  It will crack at the seam's with the bakelite.  Paint
will not cover it either.  Ask me how i know.  PC-7 bonds with the bakelight so
when you lean on the wheel while driving it will not crack (as easly).  Spend the
extra money on the PC product and the extra time sanding (It is tough stuff to
sand) and do it right.

Matthew
