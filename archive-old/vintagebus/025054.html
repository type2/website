Hi Pat.
The dimmer switch on a 67 is you turn signal switch lever.  Pull back on
it and if you have your lights on you should hear the relay in your turn
signal switch box (the thing with a gajillion connections on top) go
CLICKclick.  The turn signal relay and the high beam all work from that
box.   The wire to the gas tank sending unit IS the ground wire for the
gauge.  THere might be a wire from the tank to the frame someplace...

Good luck.

Oh yeah - I believe the 67 turn signal switch was a 1 year only.  I'd be
interested to hear if any listeees ever got a 66 switch to work...

Dave
