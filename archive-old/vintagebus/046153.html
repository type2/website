It really bugged my that the drivers door would fly open when I turned right.
No it didn't open on the freeway, just in town when I took a sharp right.
Jamming the seat belt end in the door didn't help.   Much.


So I open ed the door, and undid the two screws holding on the outside door
handle.  Then I pulled off the black vinyl panel (tidy, even if not my style),
and realised I should have took off the interior handle first.  oops.   Tapped
out the pin that holds it (it was a broken 'hot vws type' handle, to be
replace)   Okay, handle and panel off.   Two slotted screws by the inside
handle part of the mechanism, and 4 phillips screws by the outside handle
part.  Wiggle that thing out of the door, pushing aside the foam used as
insulation.  A tight fit.

okay, I take my bad part to my bucket of similar parts hopefully in better
shape.   It turns out I have NO good ones.  Oh merde.   Either they don't stay
shut, or they don't open, or, like most have the end broken off.   SO I have
to either fix one or not.  So I decide to weld the brooken off end on on.   I
pick out a likely candidate, and do a fair enough job of tacking the piece on.
No prizes except the door staying shut and that's good enough for me.   The
bit that breaks off is the end of the metal 'box' that is folded over, and has
ony the one edge holding it on.   not attached on 4 sides, just one.   Where
the screws in the door jamb hold on the mechanisms, and it keeps the tongue in
line, (which has to be done).

Grind down the edges, with my fairly new grinder (toys!) and install it.
Works!  Joy Joy!.   Installed panel, handles, et al.  

Next:  Find Reverse.

Did I mention Mr Truck did not want to back up?   Well, like a stubborn old
mule, he wouldn't.  I would have to push.  Well, that gets old.

So I decided to take the shift mechanism back to stock.  To make a long story
short, I removed the raised shift thingy in front, and removed the later bug
style coupler in back, installed a jelly donut style coupler in back (as I
remember Gus was real noisy with the one with more metal) (due to the munting
etc of tranny in older buses- pre may 59), and put a new shift plate in front.
Voila- I could back up!!!!  Cool.

okay, now  I 
Changed The Oil.
  Drain out the old stuff and mow the back lawn while it drips.  The sump
plate had slime in it, but not crunchy.      Cleaned the screen.  3 of the
studs came out.   So I took the cap nut off the studs (put two 10mm hex nuts
on the other ends and tightened them against each other to have something to
turn against).   Two of the stds and cap nuts had stripped each other, so I
tossed them.   Found soome good ones in my bolts boxes, and cleaned out the
threads on the studs and the nuts.

Installed the good studs with the two nuts tightened against each other
techniques, then after I had it in the right place, broken them loose from
each other and they uncrewed easily.    I also tried and succeeded in not
dropping things in the oil bucket, but oil still dripped on me.  I felt slimy.
Got all three in place, two felt nice a tight, one I maybe will take out next
time and use locktite but for some reason am hesitant.   Installed new gaskets
et all, and even put oil in it.   

Unfortunately the electric gremlin hit again, and the truck wouldn't start,
and the lights were dim, althought it had happily started up earier.   O shoot
I better go unhook the battery.   That's all.
