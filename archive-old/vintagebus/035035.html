I've used the back side of a 4lb axe with a 3ft handle.

......
was writ:
I should add it takes a big hammer of the sledge variety.   I first tried to
use it with a 1 or 2 pounder with all I could muster.  Nope, had to break
out the big cheese with a decent swing and it worked.  Thats basically what
a air impact is doing, but of course with much small deflection potential (
I imagine someone will now mention the potential for a bent stub or
something.  :)

&gt; I haven't had any luck with those in the two times I've had occasion to
&gt; use them.  A few days ago one didn't produce the desired result on my
&gt; '74 Westfalia; and I promptly took the bus down the street to a place
&gt; that maintains trucks for Baltimore City.  A kid there hauled out an
&gt; impact wrench the size of a fat chihuahua and it did the trick, but not
&gt; immediatly, and not without some sustained grunting by the chihuahua and
&gt; some galling of the metal behind the castelated nut (not the threads,
&gt; thankfully).
