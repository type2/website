Thom,
When we were designing the stands, you posted the pics of your bus that fell
of the stands on about the same day we decided on the design you see now...
(the coincidences that happen on this list scare me sometimes)  It really
made us think.  I agree with you about connecting the bases together and I
may end up doing that.  Another option is to put screw points at each of the
corners of each of the jacks.  This would eliminate the casters from
touching the floor.

Please realize that the goal here is simply to get it up in the air to clean
and paint.  I doubt I'll do any real wrenching on it when it's that high up
and I discourage having drunken guest in the garage.

... constructive criticism is always good...

David
