So... I have heard different stories re Safari Window quality and longevity 
from non-list members and now I want it from the *experts*, from those who 
care.  NOS would be nice but how about the aftermarket ones like Busboys?  
And the thread asking about Izzy?  Any opinions on who's are closest to 
original and have the best performance... as in going the distance?  Both 
front and rear ?  I am starting the planning on my 1963 15-Window 
restoration and although not original to this unit I like the idea alot.
