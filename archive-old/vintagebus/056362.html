&gt;
&gt; I have seen the exact seal material that is being sold by everyone these
&gt; days listed in a McMaster Car catalog. Im not sure on the spelling here
&gt; though. This company only sells to businesses and is a wholesaler. I have
a
&gt; few friends who order different materials for building racing sailboats
and
&gt; this company sells everything you can imagine. They have a webpage that is
&gt; great, I just heard abouth them this weekend and have not looked up the
&gt; url. I did not see their price per foot for this seal material, but I bet
&gt; this is where all of the retailers are buying the stuff. You can get it
&gt; with aluminum, steel, or even stainless clips.

&gt; Boy! Was I off on the price for the Black Pinch on rubber, metal enforced,
&gt; and,-with the crush rubber seal!   It fit on to my Puck pop-top, Perfect,
&gt; and I am sure it would work for your pop-top camper--The cost was $12.00
&gt; for
&gt; 16 feet of it!!! If anyone wants any I will get it for you--just let me
&gt; know
&gt; the length--I can bring to Pomona,  Or if you really need it I will ship
&gt; for
&gt; shipping costs! This is Not Junk!! It is Automotive Quality--On Monday I
&gt; will go to the place and check on the door rubber--I think it only comes
in
&gt; Black  stay tuned--TWWM, uj
