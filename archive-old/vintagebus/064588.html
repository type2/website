Subject: Re: [VB] Re: Mystery Wheels

Somewhere I picked up a couple of 15&quot; wide 5 chrome rims that weren't wide 
fives, but same width as 15&quot; bus rims.  They had the series of ovals round 
the edge like 67 bug rims though.  I planned on putting them on my 61, but 
the offset was too far out.   They were dated sometime in 65.   I was told 
they were 356 rims, but have no idea if it's true.

&lt;&lt; &gt; I can't tell if the date code is 8-5x or 8-6x, but if it's 6x, maybe
 &gt; these are early Type 3 wheels?  Googling around says Type 3 wheels
 &gt; have a 46 mm offset and should be marked &quot;46&quot; or &quot;ET 46&quot; somewhere.
 
 It very clearly says &quot;56&quot;
