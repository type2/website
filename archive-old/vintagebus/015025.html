Lucky for me this bus came with two sets of seats, Bug and original.
Original seats need upholstery but who complains?

&gt;In 66 and 67 sundial installed windows that look like the ones on
&gt;&quot;westies&quot; that bolt into the same size hole in a panel camper.  If you 
&gt;can
&gt;find them, that would be your bet.
&gt;
&gt;as for the seats, probably all you need to do is find the originals, 
&gt;and
&gt;bolt em in.  Shouldnt be a big deal.  Problem is, they are hard to 
&gt;find as
&gt;they rarely get separated from the bus.  When you do find them they 
&gt;are
&gt;usually cheap or free.... but it may take some digging around.
