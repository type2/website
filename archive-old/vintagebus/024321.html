Subject: My new record for engine pull

I pull my engine quite often, so I'm getting pretty good at it.  This
last time I cheated a bit
because I removed the bumper and rear deck the day before (8 bolts).

Drum roll please:  14minutes.

I've done a few things to speed up the engine pull:
All wires have connectors near the front of the engine bay (front is
front)
My fuel line comes through the (grommetted) engine bay metal rather than
the engine tin metal (I really like this approach)
   so the fuel line gets disconnected in the engine bay before starting
the actual pull rather than under the car with the engine half out.
I've ground down the metal around the tranny where the engine mount bolt
nearest #3 cylinder sits and it sits on several washers so I can
   actually get a socket on it.  I use a ratcheting boxend for the bolt
nearest #1 cylinder.
Big time anti sieze on the heater box barrel nuts.

Putting the engine in takes a bit longer, usually about 30 minutes.

...Markus
