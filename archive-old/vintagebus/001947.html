I ended up purchasing one of the sets of symmetric euro lights posted on
ebay ($200... ouch but then again rechroming and refurbishing an old set
would come close to that...).

Anyway, from the posted photo, the symmetric units have the hold down screws
close to the tab.  There were two sets of the asymmetric units as well but
they had the opposing hold down screws.

My double cab is chassis number 469869 (if I can remember correctly).
