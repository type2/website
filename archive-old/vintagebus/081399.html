Subject: Got my Westie

That's a pretty swell slide show. Made us jealous to get on the Route 66 
trip! Great score on the westy too. We have a barn fresh pop-top too we hope 
to have ready by the end of next summer. (At least yours drives. And has 
working wipers!)

I'll defer to someone else on the window question, but I would think that 
all windows would be made to fit in the standard cut-outs. On a hot night 
you might be wishing you had those windows though.

I've seen lots of customizing at various VW meets. I'd say it's your bus and 
make it the way you want it!
