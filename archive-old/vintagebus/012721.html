&gt; I may be moving to a very cold climate. Is there anyway to boost the
&gt; heat? Any ideas?

Nope, sorry.  We don't encourage original thought on the list :)

There are several routes you can take to heat nirvana.

First, you can get the stock heater working as it was intended (they
seldom are).

Second, you can install a gas heater, as was often done from the
factory for cold climates.

Third, you can install a propane furnace.

Fourth, you can install a water-cooled engine and heater.

Fifth, ever consider a wood stove?

(etc).

Try an archive search on the keyword &quot;heater&quot; and you'll probably get
a few hour's reading material.
