Subject: Re: [VB] new to chicago area

Hi Woody,

Thanks for the invite to a DBG event, actually it's
the second one today.  The reason I commented about
the weak VW bus scene is only because I never see any
on the road.  I probably see 2-3 pre-67 buses over the
span of a year here in the city.  I spotted a
butt-load of bays last week for some reason, mostly in
Lincoln Park.

Maybe if I visited your  club I would see more. :-)

Paul

&gt; &gt; It's definetly slim pickins here in Chicago for
&gt; ACVWs.
&gt; &gt;  &gt;
&gt; &gt; Chicago is pretty weak in the VW scene, probably
&gt; due
&gt; &gt; to the rust factor and not too many have survived
&gt; the
&gt; &gt; salt.  &gt; &gt;
&gt; 
&gt; I would have to disagree !
&gt; Maybe not that many in Chicago proper, but in Cook
&gt; County ,I can think of
&gt; dozens and dozens into acVw's., and 20 to 30 into
&gt; air cooled
&gt; buses.Several of them are in Chicago.
&gt; 
&gt; Paul, you are due to come to a dbg &quot;event&quot;, just a
&gt; thought :-)
