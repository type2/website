Subject: Re: Steam Clean an Engine?

&gt;If you slowly drop water down your carb while your engine is running,
&gt;it will slowly &quot;steam clean&quot; your pistons, cylinders, heads, and exhaust.

Yep.  If a water-cooler gets a head gasket leak between the water jacket
and the cylinder, the affected piston and cylinder will often be nice and
clean when you take the head off.  Water doesn't compress too well, so if
it was a big leak, sometimes the piston gets dirty again when it comes
through the bottom of the engine.

When water boils to steam, it expands to something like 1700 times its
original volume.  Even if you could put the water in just at the start
of the power stroke, the piston/cylinder only allows for something like
6x to 8x expansion.  (Even a diesel engine will only allow 20x-25x
expansion.)  So, you will create high pressures in the cylinders by
doing this.

If you had a high-mileage engine that you suspected had a lot of carbon
in it, it might be worth a try to run small amounts of water through
the intake.  You might buy a little time before a teardown or
replacement.  But I personally wouldn't do this as a standard procedure.
