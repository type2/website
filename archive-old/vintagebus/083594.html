Does  anybody know where to get the original style wire crimpers for a 
reasonable  price? Wolfgang Int. sells them for $129 but that is quite  spendy.



Hi Seth,
Try:

(http://www.sherco-auto_dot_com/wiring.htm) 
 
We use the RIC1
As for the brass terminals:

If someone has found a better source for these terminals or has figured out  
which size/# are used in the VW wiring harnesses we like to hear about  it.  
So far we have only bought these from a now missing swap meet  supplier.
