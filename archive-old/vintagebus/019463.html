Subject: Fwd: Re: FUEL PUMP WARNING

i forwarded ronnie's message on to a friend of mine.  he apparently drives a vanagon (at least according to his email address) but did have the following to say.  hey, does a vanagon even have a fuel pump?  ;-)

Uh What?  There is NO, as far as I've ever seen, an ALTERNATOR style pump 
that uses a LONG pushrod.  But then again, some people are purchasing 
inferior quality pumps from some suppliers and retail outlets, or are maybe 
just installing the WRONG RODS FOR THE PUMP.  Since it really doesn't matter 
if the engine is an alternatored or generated ENGINE, the only crucial thing 
is the MATCHING OF THE ROD TO THE PUMP. Putting a long rod in an alternator 
style PUMP will result in the rod inside the pump breaking or the diaphragm 
tearing, while using a short rod in a generator PUMP will result in low or no 
fuel pressure.
Rachel, pass this along if you'd like.
