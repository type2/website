Subject: Hydroboost for your Bug


Okay...

I must have been a dead ringer trying to invite guys to the supercarbs
mailing list...and on a VW bug list, a list devoted to one of the most
fuel efficient cars of all time ! Hehehe okay. There have been a couple
who joined up and I'm thankful. Anyway...

Here's some free info on a hydroboost unit that you can build. Yeah, it
is originally meant to increase mileage, but I guess VW fans don't
really need that. How about this...it increases mileage by increasing
your engine's HP generation. If mileage doesnt really tickle you, how
about increased power from your bug's engine ??

Yeap. you'll feel the difference. I've been able to chase 1600 Mazdas
and  Fuel Injected Corollas after I installed my unit. The thing is, my
underchassis is in such a bad state of repairs that my poor car cannot
safely negotiate speeds above 100 kph on roads with potholes or mounds. 
(if the wheel hits a pothole, the car suddenly steers hard left or
right). My Bug is a 1968 1200 cc. 

The mileage is superb. On a test run ( I know there are other Filipinos
on the list, please help me out with the distances) I filled her up in
Makati, got stuck in a 30 minute traffic jam, sped all the way to
Mayapa, Laguna, ran to the Calamba town proper and back (to buy some
booze), then sped back to Manila City. I was even able to go to work
from Manila to Makati the next day. On my attempt to get home from work
,that's when I ran out of fuel.(I had a 2 liter reserve inthe
compartment).  Speed while on the highway was 80 kph. Before the highway
run, I was able to close the Volume Adjustment screw on my carb all the
way in. At relatively high rpm (I dont have a tach, sorry), the engine
did not die off. Of course, that's OK for highway conditions but bad
news for stop and go city traffic. I'm not sure if that's really
news...there must be something about the SOlex 30PICT-1 that I don't
know about. Anyway...

I put in only 7 liters (about 100 pesos worth) for the entire run.
Friends who are helping me estimate that distance put the overall
covered distance at 150 kilometers. Converting to English terms, this
means a mileage of about 40 mpg. Not bad huh.  

There are a few things to consider before you make and install your own
hydroboost. I had to learn the hard way. 

1. Ignore the materials list. Do not use galvanized screws as they only
last for a day. Afterwards, they succumb to galvanic corrosion and the
corrosive effects of pure oxygen. Ditto with the tin can covers. Save
yourself the aggravation and invest in Stainless Steel bolts. If you
can't buy em, have a machine shop make em for you, and if you can choose
your steel, choose the &quot;L&quot; variety of Stainless steel for both the bolts
and the perforated plates. 

2. After a month of experimenting with my unit, I found that it
frequently blew its fuse, specially when the water level ran low and the
electrolyte concentration was very high. To resolve this, I took the
advice of George Wiseman (www.eagle-research_dot_com) that I should put the
hydroboost in series with an appliance. So I did and put it in series
with my cabin blower. I was able to up the electrolyte content to 6
teaspoons (tank capacity~ 500 ml) of new battery water, and found out
what they meant when they said that &quot;it should look like water with
alka-seltzer dropped in&quot;. At any rate, if you have an electrical load in
series with the hydroboost, the more electrolyte, the better (don't
overdo it though, experiment first). Maybe the maximum &quot;safe&quot; limit is
about 10 tablespoons of new battery water, if you have an electrical
load in series with it. 

3. I didnt use a PVC pipe as stated. In my haste and excitement to have
a hydroboost unit, I used a screw-top tupperware canister. Needless to
say, a PVC tank will be much more durable in the long run. 

Given all that, here's the URL. It's a book that you should buy, but
some prick put it up on the net, apparently without the author's
permission. So get it on-line, while it's still free.
