for-the-record I would not have my 65 westy If it was a walk-through.   Also
Dr.Freud drove a bench seat bus.   Walk-throughs are un-comfortable on road-
trips.   sad.   There is something missing from your walk-through-buses.
Reduced to making fun of my name to make yourself feel better, with only two-
thirds- front-seat,  it is really fear of interaction, you need that separate-
seat to convince yourself you don't need people, that you are an island, like
that little seat-island all by itself.    I hope you get help    :)
