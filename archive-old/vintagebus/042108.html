&gt; I don't think that's true.  I just read an article about that (but, of 
&gt; course, can't remember where), but the major distraction that caused 
&gt; accidents was people eating or drinking (like coffee or soft drinks) while 
&gt; driving.  Cell phone use was way down on the list, like 2 or 3 percent of the 
&gt; distractions that cause inattention to safe vehicle operation.  Not that I'm 
&gt; advocating driving while phoning (or is it phoning while driving?).

I'm rather suspicious that cellphone use has suddenly become such a
&quot;safety hazard&quot;.  Cops, truckers, hams, CBers, and taxi drivers have used
2-way radios in their cars for years without causing carnage.

I read (and then lost) an article that ran in the Saturday Evening Post
during the 30's.  It addressed the serious problem of drivers being
distracted by the (then) new AM automobile radios.  The prediction was
that these radios would be outlawed within months!  If only they could see
the hypercomplex audio systems that cars currently have!

In the meantime, my bus still remains a rolling orgy of technology, with
UHF, VHF, and HF 2-way radios, GPS receiver, etc.  Still no cell phone
yet, though!
