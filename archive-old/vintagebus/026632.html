&lt;&lt; Would I be able to use the disc brakes up front with a brand new master
 cylinder on a 66 Crew Cab?  I purchased all new brake components for the
 supply of braking power as well as the innards of the rear drums, so I'd
 have all new metal brake lines as well as the rubber lines.  I held off on
 the front mechanisms because I've switched a number of bugs from drum to
 disc quite successfully.  Could I use the Bus Boys adapters and disc brakes?
 Thanks for the info.  Every time I try to call Bus Boys, they are either not
 open yet (I'm on the east coast) or I get home and it's too late
 (unfortunately, I'm still on the East coast.)  Plus, I like hearing from
 listees who do the occasional work rather than the Bus Boys people, who say
 it's a snap and it turns out to be a symphony...ya know what I mean?  Thanks
 for any advice you can offer.

 Paul,
I agree that the project of installing the albatross beam was a bit more work
than they told me. I think it is fair to say that most of their advice runs
to underestimating the work involved. I have had no trouble reaching them,
and they have been very willing to answer questions on the phone. I note that
there has been little maintenance to their web page recently.
I am not sure what advice to give you about the suitability of your master
cylinder for disc brakes. I have the very expensive '67 only unit and it is a
dual circuit unit. A disc brake conversion will require the installation of
the pressure reducer from a bay window bus to the rear drum circuit and the
installation of a 2 LB check valve in the front brake circuit to keep a
little pressure on the calipers to keep them near the discs. this prevents
excessive pedal travel. The buses with discs from the factory had this built
into the master cylinder.
Check the archives for more info.
good luck
