what I ended up useing for 15&quot; tires were Cooper Achiver (?) 205/75/15, the
reason I went with these was because they are rated a SUV tire and have 2
ply side walls where as most tires of this size have 1 ply sidewalls, I had
these on the side loader going to Jerome (fully loaded) and I couldn't
notice any sway from the side walls on these going around all the curves
that we encountered on the trip up. So after all the 15 inch tire discussion
it all boiled down to a SUV rated tire which has stiffer sidewalls then most
passenger car tires, there are many brands out there like this I soon
discovered so the tire thread can END here and now, these are the facts!

ps: I think if I recall the load rating was over 1500 lbs per tire.

pps. SEMA is in November and I will still be on the quest for the 6/8 ply
rated 185/195 15 that I was told were available by import only, just so we
can all have a macho truck tire on our buses.

Hey Ronnie,

Are those nanking 8-plys available in a 15 inch size?  Whatever happened to 
your check up on those firestone 15 inch tires, or did the recent scandal 
change your mind?

Mike A.
'64 SO-35, looking for the perfect 15 inch tire ...


&gt;I have been useing NANKING (made in Taiwan) 195/14 8 plys on my 60 DD, I
&gt;have over 34000 miles on them and still have at least half my tread left,
&gt;looks like at least another 10,000 miles before replacemant and will use
&gt;these again.
&gt;
&gt;ronnie
&gt;
&gt;ps: i run 60 lbs tire pressure all the way around and rotate every time I
&gt;check the brakes (once) and remember the heat out here, very hard on tires.

&gt;[...]
&gt;
&gt;That's mighty short service life.
&gt;
&gt;I understand that you're somewhat bound by the warranty situation, but if
&gt;that's typical wear for the Yokos I think I'd be shopping hard for a
&gt;different tire.
&gt;
&gt;On a related [sort of] matter...  As I passed a local tire store today I 
&gt;saw
&gt;an early bay-window in the shop with the rear end held up by a jack under
&gt;the crankcase.  I expect the owner will be installing new motor mounts 
&gt;soon.

&gt; &gt;&gt;  ...bought Yokohama 370 M&amp;S (LT195/75 R14 load range D). After 26 K 
&gt;miles
&gt;I have had the first failure. The right rear has a tread separation (felt
&gt;like a out of balance tire at ~60) and also a warn nail on the other side.
&gt;The rest of the tires are Ok but showing wear, I expect another 10 K max
&gt;before replacement. The local dealer has ordered a replacement tire under
&gt;warrantee (don't know my cost yet) so I will have 2 new tires (spare was
&gt;new) on the rear.
&gt;
&gt;Pressure has been kept at 50r/42f, tires balanced when bought, never
&gt;rotated.  &lt;&lt;
