Subject: Re: [VB] Transmission update

Usually it takes a while for a tranny to completely die, and you generally 
have loads of warning.   I'm not sure how long your trip is, but if it was me 
I'd be more concerned about the rest of the bus.  Ie, since you just got it, 
how's the motor?   Has it been sitting a while?  Cause it's generally pretty 
risky to take a trip unless you have putted round town at least 300 mi with a 
sitting motor, and change the oil when it gets dark, which can be in 40 
miles.    That gives you a chance to work the kinks out.
  FWIW the tranny in my bug has made a whine at 45-50 mpg in 4th  for the 
past 60,000 miles.     Some metal shavings on tranny magnetic plugs is 
normal.  Chunks are bad, fuzz is okay.    Was the oil pretty clean, or like 
thick gloppy stuff?   Best to drain it after driving, so it's all stirred up 
and warmed up.    Brassy sheen to the oil is bad, as that means the synchros 
are going, but they can take a while to go.    Does it pop out of gear?   
Shift okay?  I got about 20k mi out of a tranny after the oil was brassy, 
before I took it out for rebuild.  Shifting got worse into second though, and 
the whining gradually worse, then a bad RGB noise (ie rumbling) appeared, and 
it was time for a rebuild.   Rumbling is bad, don't road trip if it's 
rumbling.   The Rgears will eat through the RGBoxes.   there were some folks 
from BC (Canada) who drove down to Mexico, and got back to OLY, WA  last year 
when a RGBox froze- and it had been making rumbling noises BEFORE they left!  
I have the pieces as a souvenir.  I mean, trannys are pretty sturdy, a little 
metal fuzz is no big deal.  Just keep oil in it. (are the axle boots good?)

Sounds like you've been catching up on a lot of delayed maintenace.   Are the 
brakes good?  lubed the suspension?  
often when someone has sealed off the spare tire area in a walk through it 
was because the bus had had a SW gas heater installed at one time- are there 
holes drilled in the horizontal area to the left of the engine and a gap into 
the cargo area forward and to the left of the gas tank?

Congrats on getting to know your new bus.  :)

&lt;&lt; I drained the rgb's and main box on the transmission today, and I
 discovered a healthy amount of metal filings on the drain plug for the
 main box.  That could explain the whine, I loaded it back up with GL-4
 90W and the whine has become less pronounced.  I am going to drain in
 again in a week and inspect the plugs for more shavings, if it is bad
 then I will rent a car, if not then I'm taking the trip in the bus.
 This will be my first major trip in the bus and as such it has been
 getting a lot of attention.  In the last two weeks I have:  fixed the
 turn signal wiring (along with hazards), dome light wiring, checked and
 adjusted the valves, changed out the release bearing (had to pull engine
 for that), adjusted the emergency brake linkage, fixed the defroster
 (had to rig a tube from exchanger to body, at least until my new one
 arrives from depot), replaced the sunroof vinyl, cleaned the windows
 (hey I can take credit for that, there's 21 of them, and it took longer
 than the valve adjustment.), replaced a missing exhaust clamp (which
 along with the missing heater tube made for some nasty fumes in the
 cab.), fixed my horn (cracked, and tends to stop working whenever
 someone cuts me off.), adjusted front headlights so that other drivers
 don't hate me as much, degreased everything, crushed my fingers, changed
 the transmission fluid, and felt a new feeling of dirty.
    I am more in love with her everytime I turn a screw.  She holds less
 mystery for me everyday.
