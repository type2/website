Thom (and the list),

If you have a similar brochure it's a little easier to compare it to. Look
real close at the corners; if it's 30+ years old, it should have some minor
dings where the ink will have rubbed off. Check the spine to see if there
is ink missing from the edge. If there is alot of ink on the spine, sure,
it could have been closed most of it's life, or it may have been printed
recently. On the centerfold, look to see if it has ripped slightly or if it
looks like it could tear easily, a sure sign the paper stock is old. Also,
when you lay it down on a flat surface, do the edges curl slightly? If so,
it may have been printed with the paper grain going the wrong direction in
the press and have a curl to it, a giveaway that it was a (poorly printed)
repop. Feel the paper stock to see if it is a similar weight to a similar
original brochure. My SO-42 brochure feels like a 70# coated text weight.

If all else fails, you could use the ol' sniffer. It takes a little while
for the chemicals to completely evaporate from a freshly printed piece.

With scanners and other 'Desktop Punishing' equipment getting better and
cheaper, more hacks will undoubtedly show up. When you scan a printed piece
and reprint it, you'll most likely get a 'moire' pattern in the photos (
kinda hard to explain, it's like when you put two fine mesh screens on top
of one another and rotate them and it makes wacky patterns). A PhotoShop
operator can descreen and correct most of these things, but it will then
appear slightly blurry on the printed piece. (Although, on my -42 brochure,
it looks like the magenta plate shifted some on press, so it's not
perfectly registered). Nothing wrong with repro literature, but there
should be some cutline of text saying it is a reprint somewhere on the
piece. With VW cracking down on websites, I wouldn't go near trying to
reprint copyrighted materials unless VW or the ad agency(ies) gave you
permission to do so. Yeah, right.

If someone repro'd the camper brochure, he or she would have to have
printed at least 5,000 to break even, with the folds, four color process
and saddle stitching, unless they're asking 30 bucks a pop.

That's all I can think of, maybe there are some printer/bus drivers on the
list who can back me up or correct me.

&gt;How would I be able to tell if a particular SO42 camper manual is
&gt;NOS as claimed or repro.  I've been informed that there was a run
&gt;of repops by someone in washington, but the one being presented to
&gt;me is being touted as NOS, but it's in super-duper spiffy condition,
&gt;ie no traces of aging.  Any clues?
&gt;
&gt;Thanks.
