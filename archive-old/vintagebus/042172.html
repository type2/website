&gt; THANK YOU to all who posted regarding my tire questions; the gist seemed to
&gt; be: Bridgestone 603s are GREAT driving tires, but you WILL have problems in
&gt; sand, mud, gravel or wet grass.

Well, it all depends on what you call &quot;off road&quot;.  A lot of folks
interpret &quot;off road&quot; to mean any driving that isn't on asphalt or
concrete.  For this activity, just about any tire will do, and there can
be some advantages to smoother tires.  

Among the advantages are the fact
that you can spin the tire in a soft spot without digging an instant hole.
Another advantage is that the relatively closed tread doesn't throw as
many pebbles at your fenders and undercarriage as a more aggressive tire.

OTOH, if you interpret &quot;off road&quot; as &quot;driving where there is no trace of
vehicle passage&quot;, then your traction and flotation requirements go way up.
The bus wasn't really made for these situations, but it will rise to the
occasion if sanely driven.
