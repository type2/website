Subject: RE: [VB] hinge correction:
Date: Wed, 16 Feb 2000 08:29:33 -0600

&gt;a couple of people have told me that the hinges are _not_ the same up
&gt;until 79, there was a change there somewhere but no-one i have spoken 
&gt;to is sure of the year.

A year ago I would have told you that the hinges changed in 74.  But if I
remember right, Nikki's 72 had what I would have called late-style hinges.
So who knows.  But for the most part, I would assume 73 and older to have
the old-style hinges.
