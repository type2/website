&gt; Hello,
&gt; I have the same problem with my 67.  The blinkers blink really fast.

Ed,

There is an electrical transistorized oscillator in the flasher box (I
assume your 67 - like mine- has the 9 pin box). Most likely, a component,
such as a capacitor, in the circuit, has changed it value, and has become
significantly smaller (in electrical size, not physically!). This is why
it would be blinking faster.

If you know someone who is electronically adept (I don't have my shop set
up at this point), they could analyze and find the defective part.

If you'd like to try substituting for the 9 pin box, there is an article
and procedure here:

good luck,
