&gt; &gt;I have a '65 DC with worse bed problems than yours. My bed was rusted-out
&gt; &gt;completely from the cab back about 2 feet. The top hat under that section
&gt; &gt;was rusted-out as well. I'm faced with the unpleasant task of locating a
&gt; &gt;good used section of bed to replace my bad piece.
&gt;
&gt; Where were you people 3 months ago when I couldn't GIVE away a rust-free
&gt; truck bed??????
&gt;

I was unsubbed, trying to find a nice rust-free bed!!

Seriously, I don't even need a whole bed, just a piece about 2 feet long
going the width of the bed along the back of the cab. A piece this size
could even be shipped reasonably.

If you or anybody else runs across a piece, I sure would appreciate it if
you would let me know. I've been working on my truck for 4 years, doing
major frame and sheet metal work. I've been looking for bed metal since I
started working it.
