Subject: Re: [VB] VW Bus story in Tucson paper

Good thing people don't lump us all into that blasted stereotype!
&gt; Somebody shoot me please if they ever seem me wearing a F'ing tye-dye
&gt; anything!!!

I am 67 years of age  and I wear my &quot;Colors&quot; -- &quot;Tye-Dye&quot; VW shirts most
every day, even to Church,-- and proud of it--Fits right in with our
&quot;Bessie&quot;, a Sundial camper that followed The Dead, for many years--Bessie
still has Her &quot;Colors&quot;  Murals of Jerry Garcia, on the camper--
Why would we all want to look the same ? That's Boring !! Its your VW
splittie,  do with it what makes you feel good-- Bessie not only make Lady
Magoo and I feel good--But LOTS of other people as we cruise on down The
Golden Road--And I got through this response without having to sensor a
single word--PEACE !! Forever--, uj
