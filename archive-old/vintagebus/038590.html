I got to drive Clyde tonght! he's back on the road. it ran great, it stopped
great. My business partner drove it and finally understood the appreciation
I have for buses. I brought it down to a FLACS (Friendly Local Area Coffee
Shop) and my roomate and I stayed there until it closed and all the kids
were in awe of my bus. it was really funny. they wouldn't let me leave. Of
course, they were drawn to the safari windows, Dormobile top (you can sleep
up there?), lack of front door windows(i'm changing the seals), and love
seat in the back. In the dark, you can hardly tell it's just spray painted!
Then we went on a stroll to my friend Jerome's house and got more googlie
eyes by his friends that were over. I also met a guy that used to have a 64
that he lowered and put a 1776 in it. It was funny to see the clashing of VW
performace vs. VW reliability. It's great to be driving my bus again. thanks
for listening.
