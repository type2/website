Subject: Re: [VB] Check out this custom bus!!!

Hurray!  finally.
You know I *almost* found it on my own.  When I was doing a search, I used kelly
by itself and got the picture of the dog.  Woops, no bus here, oh well.  Next
time I guess I'll dig a little deeper.

Now on to the bus,
Can you provide any info on it?
Did they keep the engine stock?
What's the interior like?
Looks like they removed the windows, did they finish the tops of the doors or
leave them open?
BTW, Its kind of fun driving the bus without the windows in place.  I did that
for a while when I got my DC back on the road for the first time.  My daughter
and I were coming home one saturday and her long blonde hair was flying out the
bus, we had a good laugh as people drove by pointing and joining us in the
laughter.
I'm guessing this thing is located in Jacksonville NC?
