Subject: Re: [T2] Testing Fuel Gauges/Senders??

&gt; OK let's see if I can explain myself.  My 66 Bus has a Custom (that way when I
&gt; bought it) Fuel Tank (about 20 gallons) with a Stewart Warner (SW)  Sending
&gt; Unit and SW Gauge.  The gauge is unhooked and still reading 1/2 tank, so I
&gt; assume the gauge is bad.  I can try and find a SW Fuel Gauge but would like to
&gt; use the 12V VW one I bought.
&gt; 
&gt; Does anyone know the Ohms range for a Stock Fuel Sending Unit?  The SW is a
&gt; 240 Ohm unit, I don't have a stock one to test.

0-10 ohm full
22+-5% ohm 1/2 tank
47+-5% ohm full tank
