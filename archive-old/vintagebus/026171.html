&gt;...I get VolksWorld from the UK sometimes and they advertise scads of rust free california sheet metal as well as busses...
&gt;
I have noticed some of the UK importers selling Buses that they bought in CA/AZ stated as &quot;CA/AZ Bus, rust-free, ...&quot; and it is not always true.

For instance, my friend had a '55 Euro Single Cab (which I probably should have bought in retrospect).  It came from CA, he lived in AZ, a guy bought it and shipped it to the UK.  I saw the UK ad &quot;AZ Single Cab, lived whole life in AZ Desert, no rust, good engine, etc..&quot;.   It was not an AZ truck, it had some bed rust (probably zero by UK standards), and don't even ask about the engine...  So buyer beware!
