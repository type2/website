Back in the early '60s a fair number of English Ford-based Dormobile full
camper/caravan conversions were imported and sold on the US West Coast.  For
some reason similar vintage VW-based Dormobile conversions were very rare
out here.

I owned one of the EnFo Thames Dormobiles [a 1961] for several years, and it
was always surprising how many folks would stop and say they had one, their
neighbor had one, etc.  As recently as 5 years ago there was a local body
shop that was specializing in restoring these rigs and was buying all they
could find regardless of the condition of the vehicle.

What I'm getting at is this...  Were all the Martin Walter Dormobile
&quot;Dormatic&quot; seats the same, or did they build different seats for different
chassis?  I've never seen a split-window VW full Dormobile conversion other
than in photos, but all things considered it wouldn't surprise me to learn
all the &quot;Dormatic&quot; seats were the same  and just arranged to fit the
different chassis.

If this IS true, then those EnFo Dormobiles could be a source of seats for
an early VW-based Dormobile restoration.  The Thames bodies are extremely
susceptible to rust, so not many are still on the road.  But in my own
experience the &quot;Dormatic&quot; seats are very sturdy and durable, right down to
the springs and upholstery.  The steel and aluminum floor fittings for the
seats also seem to be more durable than the Thames bodies.

FWIW.....

&gt;&gt;  Who says all the good busses are in CA?  First pictures I've seen of a
complete set of Dormatic seats outside of a book or two.  I think there was
someone looking for a set.  At least now they have a good reference.  &lt;&lt;
