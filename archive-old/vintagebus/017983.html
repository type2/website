not sure if any of you remember this, but my battery which is supposed to be 6
volt was reading 13.4 on my voltmeter....i tested the voltmeter on some other
batteries. it seems to be doubling the actual voltage of any battery, well the
reading it gets is double, it doesn't actually double the voltage of the
battery.(although that would be pretty cool)

anyone have any idea why this would happen? this is the second voltmeter i
have had go bad on me, i thought these thing were supposed to last forever.
