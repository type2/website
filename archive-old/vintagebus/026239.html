&gt; Hello everyone. Quick question. I am greatly considering getting my bus
painted. Right now it has the original paint on it which is in good
condition. It is Pearl White/Green color scheme. I have always liked the
Chestnut Brown/Sealing wax red colors and I am considering these for the new
paint job. How will this affect the value of the bus in the end?
&gt;
This is your Bus, right?

Looks good to me right now...

I don't think altering the colors will affect the value of a '67 13-window
Deluxe too much.  Make sure you don't have one of the last 67s or something,
might be worth keeping it bone stock.  Keep in mind you are proposing a
major color scheme change, you'd be wise to do a complete strip down - paint
the floors, roof, dash, etc. to match.  You are also proposing a paint
scheme that probably would have never come as stock on a '67.

&gt;You don't take as large a hit on commericals.

They were often repainted or delivered in primer anyway.  I noticed the VW
Classic morons didn't know a Kombi was a commercial vehicle.

I'm surprised Thom said he was considering an alternate paint scheme for his
'54 Deluxe, that would hurt the value.  It was weird to see the row of
Barndoor Deluxes at the Classic, too much Chestnut Brown/SWR in one place.
