 If this is the side piece that obscures the view of the seats from the cargo
 door, then I don't see why there should be *too* much of a frenzy - 
 Mark Adair repros those...

yes- the picture was of one of those.   thing is I have one for my 53, but it 
is for the side of the side on the right while the seat is facing forward-   
but I prefer to have the seat facing back so I guess I want a RHD panel.   so 
thom- turn your seat around for club seating and use a LHD trim panel.
