The Eurovan campers (at least those in the US)
have a shower built in.  There's a hand held
unit at the rear.  With the rear hatch open,
hang up the handle and shower away!  Very cool!

Sorta like a modern version of the old shower
bag used for split era busses (there, bus content!)
Gotta bring your own curtains if it matters, or
just wear a speedo.
