  My guess would be that your windows were originally 
the ones that the latches didn't go through the glass. 
(Can't remember what that glass is called...&quot;tempered&quot;?) 
Instead the latches mounted to a frame that held the 
glass. They have probably been replaced with the much 
easier to find style that you and I have now. My '62 
does the same thing, and it has new channels in it too. 
OTOH my DC, which was built in '59 does not have this 
problem, but came with the &quot;through the glass&quot; style 
latches.
  I suppose that the window frames on our '62s have a 
touch more room in them to accomodate the frame that the 
latch mounted to - rather than just having smaller 
glass? It seems unlikely, but Otto is telling me that 
this is so. An easy fix I am going to try is to put a 
shim under the top felt to eliminate the wiggle room.
  BTW - Otto came with one of each style and glass with 
mounting holes on both sides. I think I have at least 
one of the frame mounted latches somewhere....
