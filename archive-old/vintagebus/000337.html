&lt;&lt;Zac.....I'm with you man.  Not too many others are tho.  I've seen some of
the new ones available out there..mounted and rollin along.  I did not
know they were inserts until I got up close..real close.  And they were on
radials too!
At only $10 a pop....why not.
The last person I talked to with them had put almost 17K miles on the road
and not one problem.
Who knows?
