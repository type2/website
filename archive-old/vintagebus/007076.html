&gt;actually 62 was the first year for the gas guage as standard, though you

cutting

&gt;gal) or later (15gal) tank?  Just as you have that later beam- the truck I
&gt;had with the later beam had a later tank installed w/ gas guage - all jury
&gt;rigged.
&gt;..............

might possibly be an optional extra then?... an m code maybe? ...... got no
code tag tho - i'll be asking vw at some point for a certificate (nice
things aren't they)

10 or 15 gallon - no idea!
&gt;
&gt;&gt;right- there is a wire from the one push on connector on the sender up to
the
&gt;guage  Then a ground wire goes to one (pick your favorite) of the screws
&gt;holding the sender to the tank- attach the other end to the body of bus.

cheers, same said by eric and barb... 2 votes for the mounting screw it is!

i sorta remembered fitting this before - but it was about 8 years ago and i
just couldn't be sure for certain.

&gt;I don't understand this slopping gas around stuff.      Anyway being and
anal
&gt;retentive virgo I keep a record of when i fill up the tank.

&lt;snip&gt;
that means i'm an anal retentive gemini then eh? :)

still got it wrong tho didn't i? - that makes me a stupid ana....

- keep a running
&gt;record of milage, useful for seeing how long you can go on a tank I got
into
&gt;thehabit from driving a pre gas guage bus.

did that for a year or so... but allowed myself scope - which meant everyso
often an overfil....

until the last time...it happened, i'd just done the overfil.... what i call
fill till the pump switches off. - petrol up the neck....

a few miles down the road.... called in a village - twas actualy beddgelert
in wales - anyone fancy a true/tearjerker story? anyrode... parked up cerb a
bit... never thought about it. till i came back to the bus...to smell a lot
of petrol..and a fair bit running down the gutter underneath a lot of othe
cars. only takes one prat throwing a stub, or a stray spark....
fixed that gauge the next day.

   I've only had it ooze
&gt;out when I parked with that side of the bus tilting downhill soon after
&gt;filling the tank.
&gt;
yep thats it!  :(  --&gt; don't like it.... not at all!
