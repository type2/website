I run 20w-50 in all my motors, from the old leakers to
the new rebuilds. When I was living in Maine, I
switched to 10w-40 in the winters, but I don't find
that I have to do that here in Georgia. Then again, I
also don't find that I have to wear a snowsuit when
driving my V-dubs, either.

&gt; I run thicker oil as my rings
&gt; are going...and my oil pressure isn't the greatest
&gt; I'd imagine... I've started it
&gt; with 20W-50 in it in 10 degree weather and haven't
&gt; had a problem...but I let it
&gt; warm up for a good 5-10 minutes before I take off in
&gt; the morning.
