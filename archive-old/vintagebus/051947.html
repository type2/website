&gt; Now on the other hand if you want to see some people who think junk is made
&gt; out of gold just visit a Porsche site sometime!  Woof, used junk sometimes
&gt; and pricey too!  Good people there, just that whole scene is a little whacky
&gt; on valuing used stuff. 

One of the things that soured me on the whole barndoor restoration bit was
the strain of trying to buy parts.  Not a *financial* strain, but the sheer
amount of social engineering and bulls*t that I had to go thru to get relatively
simple stuff from the parts whores.  That, and the 'community' seemed to look
down on me because I was doing the work myself instead of having CH or LC 
or one of the other gods do it.  Screw it.

I decided to spend more quality time - and money - with the 911.  Some parts
are more expensive, but I don't have to grovel for them before I overpay.  I
think the 911 folx as a community are as good or better than bus folk.  A guy
on Rennlist's wife has to have an expensive medical treatment, and they
raised $1500+ for her in about 12 hours.
