Hi NQ-

I probably have your bus confused with someone else's, but wasn't it used to 
transport a murder victim?  If so, you probably don't want to bring that up 
in conversation :)  Other than that, heat is real nice when it's needed and 
take it easy when pulling up behind people at a light.  Every now and then I 
have someone who has never ridden in a bus before brace for impact.

Good luck,
Tristan
