I've seen dealer receipts that had custom modifications on them. Something
like that would need to be shown to prove provenance I believe. Possibly an
old photo?

&gt;Seems to me like the other concours classes have it down to the
&gt;fine print, and everything was Factory specific perfect and no screwups or
&gt;questionables? I could be wrong...

I believe that other manufacturers that are routinely in Concours classes
(such as Stutz, Duesenberg, Bugatti) had many variations. Most of those
were handbuilt, so they have to have something that shows what their
original state was.
