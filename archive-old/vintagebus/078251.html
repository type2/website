Subject: Re: [VB] battery explosion and clutch cable breaks

Remember to grease the clutch cable liberally as you are installing it. My
cables broke every 10,000 miles for about 15 years until someone showed me
that I had the cable adjusted too tightly all that while. I had adjusted
them according to the description in the John Muir Idiot manual, which was
3/4&quot; of play at the pedal, but my take on that was the 3/4&quot; of &quot;play&quot;
AFTER the cable had taken up the slack, and just before it touched the
t.o. bearing to the clutch plate. They always broke at the adjustment end
where the cable attaches to the metal threaded slug that the adjustment
wingnut screws onto. They would frey apart right there at the attachment
point.

The proper adjustment, of course, was 3/4&quot; of real free play before the
cable begins to move and take up the slack. Since that time, I've replace
one clutch cable in 12 years. Approximately 80,000 miles. I only use real
German cables as well, as there were cheaper crappier ones available as
well. I had bought five German cables in 1989 to feed my bus's cable
habit, and it was 1991 that I was shown how to really adjust it properly,
and there's only been one cable break in that time since. I still have one
spare from that batch, with one in the bus for many years.
