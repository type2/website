Subject: Re: [VB] Glowing gen light

Hi Steve,
Check:
The gen brushes, and replace if as short or shorter than the cages they sit  
into.  
The fan belt for looseness.
Clean and tight on both end of both battery cables and replace any cables  
with quicky bolt on non-swedged on ends!!  Clean and tighten  tranny to body 
strap.
 
Get a multimeter from your local hardware store and check for any voltage  
drops through the electrical system.
See section E-2, page 14, in the 1963-67 &quot;Workshop Manual Volkswagen  
Transporter&quot;.
