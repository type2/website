&gt; Since my Leatherman has several blades &amp; tools broken, I went to Sportstown

Send it back!

Leatherman really stands behind their &quot;lifetime&quot; guarantee.  A friend
of mine (who sometimes helps work on the bus, there's the VW content)
broke just about every single tool on his Super Tool after a couple
years of use, and they replaced it but had to include two admonishing
form letters to cover all the damage he'd done.  I got a Super Tool
myself and haven't destroyed anything yet, but not for lack of trying.

In the &quot;company history&quot; section they mention that Jim Leatherman
was inspired to create the first tool by what he needed to fix a car.
