Subject: cable lube

Hi all,
Went to the motorpickle shop yesterday in search of a better lube for
my speedo cable. Guys there swore by this stuff called &quot;Maxima Chain
Wax&quot;. Sprays as a liquid, sets like light wax once the solvents
evaporate. They promised it wouldn't ever go gummy on me. Anybody ever
used this product?
I asked about Mikuni carb jets, and he says he has a lot of them,
emulsion tubes too. Didn't have any loose Solex jets on me so I
couldn't compare, but next week I'll go back with a spare carb in hand
and let you know what I find.
I hope everyone is having a good weekend, I am about to crawl under
the bus and put in a new drag link, hope the play is there and not in
the $teering box.
