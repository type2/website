&lt;&lt; I had mixed results with this (bilge) method in a 68 bus several years 
ago.  Airflow was dramatically improved, yes, but the air was pretty tepid 
vs. stock flow temp -- probably a leaky situation, sucking in cold air. &gt;&gt;
Hi Joe,
That is the accessory method VW of Canada offered about 1960 with cutting and 
installing a metal squirrel fan into the forward heater tubing just before it 
curved up into the cab of the bus.
  Otherwise definitely the VW AC type1-3 engine will run 20-30F higher oil 
temp especially during the summer if cooling air is not constantly blown 
through the heat exchangers.    Eric&amp;Barb
