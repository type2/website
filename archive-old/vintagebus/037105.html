Greetings volks
Having recently acquired a 69 westy I went to check the archives to decode
the M-codes. Discovered 67 and earlier no prob, 70 and later no prob. Did 68
and 69 not exist? : ) Would appreciate if one of you folks could decode the
following;
19  8
181  191  500  517
 21  426  097  119  121
2310  523324  9005635
would really like to know date of manufacture and where delivered

70 westy
