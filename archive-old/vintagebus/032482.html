there a radio block off plate available in 67 and was it different?&gt;&gt;

Hi Wayne,
Here in the USA VWs from the early 50s on up could not be legally imported 
new with a radio in the dash.  Apparently USA radio manufatures did not like 
the idea of not having much of a chance to sell thier radios if the imported 
automobiles came with thier own factory radios!  So for our market all VWs 
had to have a block off plate.  The 1955-66 and the 1967 were differant.  The 
1967 one is just a 1958-67 bug without the three holes in it for the bug 
chrome strip.  For the 1964ish-67 time period the Sapphire 3 and 4 were sold 
at the dealerships.  Also Many other makes of radios of domestic and imported 
including under and in dash pull out radios were availible from VOA dealers.


&lt;&lt;Which brings up the &quot;pet peeve of the day&quot;.  Why do so many people refer 
to split busses as pre-67? &gt;&gt;

We never noticed that.  Our peeve is the use of &quot;Split Window&quot; instead of 
&quot;Split Screen&quot;.  Too many times someone tells us they have a split window or 
parts and instead of a bug with the split window in the back it is a split 
screen!  Kind of like a time we were approached by a fella who had a barn 
door bus back home!  We asked what year it was and he said it was a 1966 with 
those barn doors on the side!      Eric&amp;Barb
