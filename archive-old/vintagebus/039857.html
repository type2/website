3.) The driving position in the splitties are more forward with less of a
dash and a flatter steering wheel therefore more bus-like which appeals to
me immensely.

I have a 1972 camper and a 1966 panel van and live in Florida. I can say 
that the 72 camper is MUCH more comfy to drive around. First off, I dont 
have to slump over to look straight out the front window. I can also roll 
down the window and enjoy my arm laying on the edge. In a split, that 
sliding window is NOT user friendly. You just cant get the air flow in those 
windows like you can in a bay. Also, using the wing windows in a bay window 
bus makes it cooler as you drive. Kinda like the difference in haveing a 
ceiling fan in your room and not having one. One thing that scared me about 
driving around in a split bus is how close you are to the front. I have a 
bus that someone must have ran into something at an angle. If the drivers 
legs didnt get broken, I would be amazed.

I guess it all boiles down to, do you want to look cool or be cool. I 
applaud those folks that drive split buses on long trips and wonder how they 
feel when they stop, expecialy anyone that is 6' tall and over.
