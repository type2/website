Can fan motors spin both directions?
I tried plugging one into a light socket backwards once and I got nothing but 
a new hairstyle!

&lt;&lt;As to whether ambulance fans are practical, here's my idea:


Since my bus is destined to be a camper (I'll be making all the cabinetry, I

have a stock Z-bed, and all I need from someone is a icebox/range and

perhaps an interior heater (gas or propane/12-volt) ....let me start this

sentence over...


Since my bus is destined to be a camper, and Michele and I tend to travel

northwards, in either Spring or Autumn, there will be quite a bit of

cooking, coffee making, etc. inside the bus with the windows only partially

open.  So, have you ever boiled water in a VW?  You get condensation

everywhere!  My idea is to get ambulance fans or build the equivalent, and

put in a fan reverse switch (the hardest part is running the wiring) that

allows me to have the fans pump the steam-laden air to the outside through

the existing vent system!  Of course, the entire inner part of the duct is

going to be veritably rust-proof, and the reverse switch will naturally be

mounted on my own paneling in order that no 33-year-old panels need to be

cut.


What thinkest thou?
