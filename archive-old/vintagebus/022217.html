Driving in SF is fun: find one of those hills that's steep on both sides.
While you're driving up and cresting the top, you will not be able to see
the ground!  It's like a roller coaster!  And when you're going down the
other side, the seat orientation in the bus forces you to brace against the
windshield bulkhead!  You're seatbelts suspend you in the car!   I did this
for a couple hours one day with some friends - going up and down!  One
friend in the back - without a belt - ended up laying on the floor next to
the front seat bulkhead!

And this is where you'd be scrod if you took out your reduction boxes!
