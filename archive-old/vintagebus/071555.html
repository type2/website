Subject: Re: [VB] cool decals

I think it was a Mini (auto) ad from &quot;Stuff&quot; magazine. At least I think
that's where I got mine. I haven't stuck any on my bus though.  :-)

&gt; anybody know where to get those cool decals i've been
&gt; seeing on busses lately?
&gt; They're like the markings you see on the sides of old
&gt; fighter planes, little rows of planes, one for each
&gt; they shot down...
&gt; except these are little cars. pretty wicked.
