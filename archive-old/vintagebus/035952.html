&lt;&lt; Pardon my ignorance, Whats time-sert?  &gt;&gt;
Hi Disconcerter,
Time-Sert is a manufacture of solid inserts.
  A heli-coil is a spring shaped shim that inserts into a hole that you 
drill, and tap to a larger diameter, but same thread per inch/cm.  The 
problem with Helicoils is that they can not be locked into thier hole, and 
thusly will easily back out with the bolt/stud when you take something apart. 
 They are also far easier to damage by cross threading!  So we only use 
heli-coils where one would almost never take that apart (IE to secure one of 
the engine case internal studs in the case.).
  Both the heli-coil, and solid insert require special tool kits which you 
have to buy from the heli-coil or solid insert manufacture.  A solid insert 
installs pretty much the same way as a heli-coil though it requires a bigger 
diameter hole for it.  The solid insert can, and should be locked into it's 
hole so it will not back out with the stud/bolt.  If you get the kit from 
Time-Sert get the inserts that are longer.  Part # 12159, length 30mm, 12 x 
1.5mm.
  Personally we prefer to be more proactive, by first drilling, and tapping 
deeper all the threaded holes in the reduction boxes that have not been 
stripped yet.  Those that have been stripped are Time-Serted.  Then using 
longer grade 8 or metric equivalent hardness for automotive use.  The stock 
bolt from VW was 25mm long in the threads.  The bolts we are using now are 
about 40mm long.  This means with the spring plate being about 5mm thick that 
the stock bolt only had about 20mm (About 3/4&quot;) of threads on each bolt 
holding things together.  With the 40mm long studs we are using now you have 
about 35mm (About 1-3/8&quot;.  Almost double!) of threads on each bolt holding 
things together.  Also with the longer bolts the reduction box, and spring 
plate can be easily threaded, and then torqued together.
  Wether you go with heli-coil, solid insert or just drill, and tap the hole 
deeper you really need a low speed 1/2&quot; chuck hand drill.  Preferably a 
variable speed model.  Using the drill bits to open the holes up with high 
speed drill motor just puts too much stress on the outside tip of the drill 
bits, and shatter!  Even when they are high quality HSS drill bits.
