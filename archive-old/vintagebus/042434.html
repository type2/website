hi all,

my take on NOS is as follows:

literally it means New Old Stock.  So in the case of a part from
Volkswagen, that means its new, but VW no longer stocks it.  Now, if the
same part is still available new elsewhere, that has no bearing on wether
or not its NOS as volkswagen no longer stocks it.  the source of apart
determines its NOS or not status.

By that logic, since barrett just went under, everything in their
warehouse is now NOS, because barrett no longer stocks it... even though
you can get it new elsewhere.

So, unless you know who is referred to  by &quot;old stock,&quot; NOS, really has
no meaning.  But, i would say that a part that is no longer manufactured
would probably be NOS, as the highest level of parts supply (the
manufacturer) no longer stocks it.  So even if it is current stock for the
parts dealers, it wont be current stock for long...

But if it is manufactured again, you get back into the whole confusing
mess...

peas,

Steve
