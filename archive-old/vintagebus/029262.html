Subject: RE: WWII Nazi Pin

So far i have accumulated over a dozen different re-pops of this pin--The real
ones are known as &quot;tinnies&quot; because thet feel so light in your hand--it is made
out of Very light metal--in 21+ years of collecting i have seen perhaps 4 of the
real ones--I have seen these even at gun shows--in a display saying they are
&quot;The Real Thing&quot; and priced at $75.00!! Trust me, i will buy all you can send me
in &quot;The Real Thing&quot; at $75.00 a piece!  I still do not own a real one--Fair
price on a real one is starting at $300+
