&gt;I finally figured out how to fix my horn button on my 65 micro. The only
&gt;problem is I need a new piece of chrome. Specifically, the ring that the
&gt;button sits in. All the tabs have been broken off on mine, and the button
&gt;flies off and hits the roof!
&gt;
&gt;Anybody know where I can get one of those?


I have an extra...I have two horn buttons that I am using to make one good
one...and both of them have good chrome rings...I only need one....
