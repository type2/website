Subject: Re: [VB] rear bumper prices

&gt;What are you folks paying around the country for good, uncut, undented
&gt;splittie rear bumpers WITH splash pans and brackets?
&gt;A friend has one he wants to sell me, but I think he wants too much ($150).


If I needed one, I'd sure pay $150, but I'm in Minnesota, far from the bus
parts.
