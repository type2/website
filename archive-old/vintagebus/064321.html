| I went through the same thing.  If you reread the agreement the pick up time
|
| is pretty vague, for the &quot;discount service&quot; for an additional 200 we can
| express your order.  I went w/ hurst auto transport.  My bus got here, but
| it took 5 weeks and several drivers.  1 came by and said it wouldn't fit,
| another wouldn't take it if they couldn't drive it.  I had to give them the
| exact dimensions and weight.  I argued and threatened.  Remember these guys
| have to find a driver willing to take your vehicle and one that is heading
| your way.  The trucks don't work for them, they are called brokers or
| something.  I don't think you would have had any better luck with next
| company on the list either.  Next time I ship a bus I am going with a local
| company.  Also make sure that your shipper, the person on the other en w/
| the bus, has the battery secured very good or removed after its loaded.  It
| can do some damage.  Also anything that isn't tied down will move around in
| the bus.  My pristine paintjob was damaged and my rear bumper was placed in
| the bus on the floor and slid all over.  Just be patient and email everyday.
