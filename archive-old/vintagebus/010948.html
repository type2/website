Subject: 67 camper FS in Washington state

I saw this camper driving in Redmond. Talked to the old people inside.
It belongs to their son. He want $6000. It is a hard top with a great
body. Only rust I saw was in the windshield seals. Color is white. Front
seats need recovered, panels looked good and the camper stuff was great.
Didn't get to crawl all over it but it looked solid from what I saw. The
guy is Joseph Miner 425 861-6883. Contact him please this is all I know.

Good Luck!!!
