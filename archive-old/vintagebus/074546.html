Subject: RE: [VB] bus tow bar/towing

I didn't think we could tow such a weight with a four cylinder
motor...aircooled at that.

&gt; i am planning on towing a bus on the highway for about 500 miles with a
tow 
&gt; bar, can this be done at 70mph? does this kind of long distance towing on 
&gt; the buses wheels damage reduction boxes? any personal expereince, or 
&gt; suggestions would be helpful. bus is a 56.

Hi Robert,
It will tow fine IF you first go through the suspension first.  Meaning 
complete repacking and greasing of front end and changing and filling the
tranny 
and RGBs with new gear oil.  Plus a new or a good set of tires.  Lastly make

sure the tranny is in nuetral and the E-brake is released before towing!
Though 
we would keep the towing speed to 60 MPH or less because the higher the
speed 
the quicker things can get out of hand, IE getting hit by a powerfull 
sidewind.
