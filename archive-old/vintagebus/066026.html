I used the 1/8&quot; finished door skins and used the plastic seam strip to
connect each piece in my old 71 westfailure. It was a pain to locate the
light sockets correctly on the bend and I mucked up one piece, but all in
all it turn out nice. I had used the door skin in the same grain for the
side wall cabinet and back deck panels as well as the bench seat where I
stowed the tent and poles. Took me three weeks in my spare time and much
prodding from the wife, but the inside looked better than the outside.
Should have taken pictures!

Hi Stan,
Thanks for your reply.  Is the product you recommend wood-grained as well.
Kinda looking for some nice paneling to do my interior with, and $5 a 4X8
sheet doesn't sound too decorative.

Thanks again,
Ed
