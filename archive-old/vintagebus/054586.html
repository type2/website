Subject: Re: [VB] Lego Toys

Hey Michael,

Yep, Lego made some really cool VWs back in the day. There are a host of
buses, bugs, Ghias (the boring Type 1 kind) and even a Notch I believe. The
buses are extra cool, of course, because they came in barndoor versions
originally. The older ones are a little bit larger than the later ones.
They all had plastic bodies and metal wheels.

At Legoland (in Carlsbad) they have a little museum of Lego toys. There's a
display that features a lot of that style of car and includes one of the
&quot;barndoor&quot; buses. It's labled as 1956, so that's around when that style was
being made.

Hope that all helps!

Scott
