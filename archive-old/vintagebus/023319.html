Hi Jon,
Take the air cleaner off the carb.  Then with a small mirror and flashlight 
take a look at the fuel accelerator pump nozzle while you have someone pump 
the gas pedal.  No gas or dribbles instead of a nice stream, then you need to 
do a through cleaning of the carb and reverse spray out the nozzle.  Make 
sure to rap/tap that noozle tightly back in to prevent it poping out later!
