Subject: RE: [VB] heat sink thingamagig


&gt; twas writ:
&gt; hey everyone-
&gt; i recently purchased a 62 beetle an found something interesting in the back
&gt; seat. it looked at first to be a small aplefier for a radio, but then i
&gt; showed it to someone and they said that they thought it looked like a heat
&gt; sink that you would hook up after you had put big gap spark plugs in for a
&gt; hotter spark. anybody know how these are hooked up, and what it needs to be
&gt; hooked up? it only came with the unit itself, about 6x5x4, made of of billet
&gt; aluminum with fins. thanks!

I put a CDI module on a bus in the mid seventies that was about this size.
It seemed to work ok, but if you figure that the thing is about the same
age, it might be better to leave it disconnected.  Just one more unknown.
As to how it would hook up, I remember needing the instructions.  There
wasn't any way to tell what went where except matching the wire color to
the instruction sheet.

John K.
