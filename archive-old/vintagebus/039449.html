&gt;about loss of oil pressure, and now that I won't be using gauges....but I
&gt;suppose that all this is about putting a little trust in these things

This makes me want to tell you guys about my pressure readings. I have a 
guage hooked up and noticed on the highway today I am looking at about 12 to 
20 psi at 3500 rpm. Not good right? Can I use a thicker oil to help 
compensate? I assume my guage reads slightly lower, cause it reads lower 
then zero when I turn the key on and then goes higher when the engine 
starts. Still as the motor warms up it reads 20 to 40 then drops way off 
when hot.
