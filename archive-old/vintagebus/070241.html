Subject: Re: [VB] tow hitch, westy

I remember watching him as we were neighbors that day.  He didn't look
too happy at times ;-)  I guess you're right but you need small hands. 
I have a filter and just don't bother cleaning the screen.  My motor has
only 7K on a all new case/crank etc. so I'm not worried about it.

&gt; i disagree about having to drop it to change the sump plate/screen. i just had mine out and while
&gt; it is not straight forward and i can't use sockets on all nuts it does fit and i can get my hand
&gt; between the v. the only time i have to take off the hitch is to take out the engine.  and granteed
&gt; that can be a pita. just ask britt after the engine removal episode at the classic last year. ;-)
