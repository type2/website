Subject: Distributor wired 180 degrees out of whack!

Re wrote in his web page  http://www.type2guy_dot_com/59/59mech5.html  :  &gt;&gt;I 
finally realized I had installed my distributor drive gear 180 degrees off. 
So I swapped the plug cables on the cap 180 degrees. &lt;&lt;

Hi Rex,
Did you fix this later?  If not your #3 cylinder will run too hot.  VWAC 
distributors before FI have the #3 lobe for the points is offset a couple of 
degrees to keep #3 cylinder cooler.   Eric&amp;Barb
