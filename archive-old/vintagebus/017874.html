This is my first time pulling a bus suspension apart.  I'm not sure how to
tell the condition.  There is no obvious damage, and no discernable play
in any of the pieces.

I think my next move will be to clean everything up; what's a good cleaner
to use that *won't* eat up the rubber seals, in case I decide not to 
rip everything apart right now?

I did manage to split the torsion springs on the driver's side.  I'm 
*assuming* I can clean them up and tack them back together with the MIG.
Failing that, are the springs themselves the same as a '60?  I have 2 
'60 beams on tap.  Hmm.  Maybe I should swap in the trailing arms - cheaper
and slightly better brakes...

I woulda just greased it and driven it, if the rest of the car was
driveable.  I think I could have gotten away with greasing it and
driving it to loosen up the trailing arms.  Oh well.

&gt; well, how bad are the king/link pins?   you can still get new link pins- same 
&gt; as for through 63,  dont know about getting new king pins though, but if they 
&gt; are real bad you could ge them rebuilt.   But if you clean up the bits and 
&gt; see what shape they are in- that is what I would do if I was you, now all the 
&gt; bits are out.
