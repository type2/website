Subject: Searching for Axel Stauber...

Hi all,

At the 2001 OCTO Meet prior to the Classic, I bought a few NOS and used
items from Axel Stauber who had flow in from Germany for the weekend.  He=

has a VW parts business near Kassel, Germany, and he said he was about to=

establish a sales web site with e-mail contact.  I picked up one of his
older catalogs (very nice) but it had no internet addresses.  Of course, =
I
lost the web site address he gave me months ago.  Does anyone have the
correct, current e-mail address, and perhaps the web site address for Axe=
l
Stauber.  I need to buy more &quot;stuff&quot;!!!

Thanks for any help!
