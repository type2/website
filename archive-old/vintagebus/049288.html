I just uploaded my hail picture to www.vintagebus_dot_com Search on HAIL and you'll see both of our battered T2's. Goodness sakes, as they say in the midwest, the hail was the size of BB's! In April! Sorry about the quality of the picture, but it was down to 45f and I had to shoot through a window screen. 

Let's put on a few more layers on our epidermi, people. We'll need it for the extra UV, if not for this list. One person has a crabby day and corresponding post or response and we're all info-poorer for it. Ignore the first bitching and continue. Ignore the second and third, but pay attention to the fourth and fifth only. 

I must apologize to the hardworking Kelly Park people. I shouldn't have denegrated KP while deciding to take in a world class beer festival in the same corner of the world. I'd take the beer fest this year even if my mutant DC had beat Lois Grace, et al,  last year at KP. If it helped clear the air, good for clear air!
