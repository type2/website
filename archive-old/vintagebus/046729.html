&lt;&lt;   Hm, WW  1999  catalog says the german bug ones are $35 each,(  the non 
german ones are $8.50).    each Is that what you have been buying them for, 
or do you use another source? &gt;&gt;
Hi Clara,
The first one we bought for repairing the passenger wing window in our 63 SC 
was way back in '86 at the VW dealership in Abilene TX.  We have since then 
stocked up on these several year ago from Wolfsburg Warehouse and at the swap 
meets for about $20.00 or less for NOS German ones.  Eric&amp;Barb
