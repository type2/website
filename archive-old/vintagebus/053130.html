Subject: Fwd: Hatch Bike Racks '68 - '79 and tents.

I just received a shipment of Italian bike racks for the Bay Window Buses.

These have not been available for many years, but I had them special ordered 
and at a great price.

I've had one of these on my '74 Westy for the past 6 months and love it.  It 
clamps to your rear hatch and allows access to the engine compartment.  You 
can also open your hatch with the rack installed.  This is a great way to 
carry 2 bikes.  The unique clamps will work with all types of frames.

We also sell bus tents from $295.00
