Subject: &quot;Medi-Car&quot; Diagnostic System
Date: Wed, 03 May 2000 08:59:43 EDT
Mime-Version: 1.0

Hello List,

I was watching a video tape of Vintage VW ads and a couple talked about VW's 
new revolutionary &quot;Medi-Car&quot; diagnostic system and that a purchase of a new 
VW gave you 4 free &quot;Medi-Car&quot; diagnostic checkups.  It aslo stated that this 
system was able to &quot;find problems before they became problems&quot;.

Has anyone else heard of this &quot;Medi-Car&quot;?  What was it?  Does anyone have 
pictures?

Thanks
Mike
