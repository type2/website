Subject: Re: [VB] FW: Special Announcement from Volkswagen of America and Canada!

I missed the first post on this.

Someone on RAMVA got a letter from a company called &quot;Continental&quot;
asking for $XXXX for infringement.  They told them to go to hell.
Contintental cam back with &quot;how about $X-$Y?&quot;  At which point they
were told to go to hell again.  The third time they came back
with &quot;make offer&quot;

&gt; Scam.
&gt; 
&gt; Why?
&gt; 
&gt; 1. It came via email.
&gt; 2. It says in a few weeks, I've seen this email for months.
&gt; 3. It says you can respond to the email with REMOVE in the subject line,
&gt; this tactic is used to verify you have a valid email and that you have read
&gt; the note in order to contact you further as they see fit.  (Like sue you)
&gt; 4. If it was real, it'd be on vw_dot_com  IPProtector is a BS company that bullies
&gt; people, I doubt if VW even knows they have set this up.
&gt; 
&gt; Anything received via email should be immediately doubted - don't delete
&gt; files off your computer, don't forward emails that say &quot;forward this,&quot; don't
&gt; run attachments, don't email people to tell them they are infected with
&gt; a virus, and never respond to spam, especially when it says &quot;click here
&gt; to remove yourself from our list&quot;.
&gt; 
&gt; &quot;Skepticism, like chastity, should not be relinquished too readily.&quot;
