CB Sports Active Outerwear 97/98 Catalog

One of my neighbors brought over a catalog which features a splittie bus
through-out it's contents. It was cool that they brought it over as they see
me constantly greasing up the neighborhood and shlepping off to &quot;Jerome
Jamborees&quot; etc. all of the time. The bus is a '63-'66 panel conversion
camper with an assortment of the cliche' must have items(driver's side only
wiper arm, rear airscoops, baja rear wheel wells...). The yuppie models in
the ad look like they wouldn't know how to adjust valves on a bet. Check the
&quot;Rope-head&quot; deady drum leaning against the cargo door! The chick is going to
sleep with two guys? What the...? Oh, California plate. Maybe she'll be in
the tent by herself... Do you think that they brought the single hitter as
well? ;-) ROTFLMAO
Literature freaks should check it out. I would not drive clear across town
for it though...

See www.cbsports_dot_com for a total lack of VW imagery~ but a possible link to
a retail store near you.
