Subject: vw's at the drive-in movie

Hi List,
The Ft. Smith VW Assoc. is having a meet at the
drive-in theater this Saturday in Poteau, OK. We're
going to meet at the Northgate shopping center parking
lot, cruise town, then proceed to the drive-in theater
to have a cook out and watch a double feature movie.
Bring your favorite grilling foods and beverages. A
grill will be provided. Everyone in the area is
invited. I know there are some listees in Arkansas and
some in Tulsa if anyone is up for a Saturday cruise to
Poteau, OK.

See ya there!!!
3DPete
