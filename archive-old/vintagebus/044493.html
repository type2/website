 OK, I was changing the shocks this afternoon and on the left front shock
 ,  the bushing froze to the mount.  Got the shock off but the bushing is
 still there and I cant get it off..... any ideas???    jon in la mesa

my favorite technique for this is donning protective eye and ear gear, and 
grinding a flat area on one side of the bushing/cylinder.   spray penetrating 
oil liberally (like holy water) and attach vice grips and twist.    I like 
the flat spot as it gives the vise grips a place to grips, when round the VGs 
tend to not twist the bushing.
