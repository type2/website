Thanks to all for the info re: lock rekeying, now i have a two key
system becuase my ignition key is of a different profile than my door
keys - but hey, that's fine :).  It's great to have door locks working,
and all door locks taken apart and cleaned of what ever oily stuff was
in there.  Great advice from the list made the rekeying very easy.
Kinda cool when you think about German locksmiths thinkin about these
and workin on em, they are very simple yet ingenious.


Thanks again
