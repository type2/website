Thanx to all who offered solutions to the starter problem (moore/starter
problem, 10-31).  I worked backward thru all the recommended procedures,
cleaning everything, etc. with no luck until I pulled the starter to check
it on the bench.  This time I took a really good look at it, this 1 yr. old
rebuilt starter/solenoid.  I'm surprised it worked at the very beginning.
This thing looked like it was 100 yrs. old.  The armature was so worn there
was hardly anything left of it.  As for brushes, the powder fell out when I
took off the end cap.  Maybe that was why when I banged on it, it started
working again.  The brushes were probably stuck in their holders.  That's
the last time I'm buying a rebuilt anything.

Thank you all for the help.  When I put in the new one, it will include a
new bushing too, unless I go with the starter which doesn't require one.
