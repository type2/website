them.

Subject: [VB] Anyone know how Beto is?

Hi all,

I haven't been able to get Beto (type2guy_at_aol_dot_com) on the phone (keep
getting an operator), and he lives down between LA and SD. I don't know
for sure how close he might be to any of the fires, he may be in the
clear for all I know, but I can't get ahold of him. Anyone talked to him
in the last week?

Beto, are you reading this? Email or call me if you can.
