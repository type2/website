Subject: Re: Tool organization

Rex asked:
&gt; Tell me about your tool organization and what 
&gt; works best for a cheapskate with tons of hand tools.

In addition to acquiring tools, I've managed to get
my hands on various tool boxes. I separate tools into
separate tool boxes. All of my metric sockets, including
the oddball long and star fasteners (forgot the name),
and US sockets in another. No danger of mixing them up.
Whole drawers for similar tools, screwdrivers, universal
wrenches, etc. Separate drawers for fixed size wrenches,
separate for metric and US sized. 

I have a separate box for the VW special tools, including
the special castle nut wrenches, oil filter (Vanagon),
and modified tools.

For the larger tools, bigger than would fit into a
tool box, I have an old dresser-like cabinet with 
about 20 drawers, for groupings of tools. Hammers, sharp
stuff, drawing, solder, planers, tool belts, sanding,
caulking guns and such. Tools only, no materials.

Low volt electrical test tools have a separate little 
box with weird adapters, clamps, jumpers, etc. 

Phone tools and testers in a small pouch, etc.

Jeff  bussless, but loads of tools, ready for one
