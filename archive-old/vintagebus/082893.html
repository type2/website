&gt; publicly appologize to Karl for sending it out to everyone. I am not
&gt; the playground police on what should and shouldn't be said. I stand
by
&gt; my comment, but a simple private message would have sufficed. I
&gt; appologize to Karl for acting this way, and taking the list down to
a
&gt; path that should not have been traveled.

Nah...it thought it was funny...I was half expecting a full blown 
explanation on how you should remove the stub axles with 
the RGB's and tranny in place.  It's not like it hasn't happened 
before.  And what so bad about it?  Most of us have been 
on this list long enough to know who will post this stuff and 
who will start flaming over it.

Unless I totally missed the point...
