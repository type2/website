Craig writ:
&gt;$25 a wheel is what I have settled on. The range is from surface rust and
dirty to primered in DP40 and painted black. Hubcap clips vary widely. &lt;

From my experiences this is a high price for a wheel...  Maybe if they were
16&quot; it would be reasonable.  I am used to paying $5 for a wheel with a used
tire on it.

Depending on your area this maybe reasonable, but search around before you
pay more than you have to.  Plus if you are out for just one, I am sure a VW
buddy may just give you one if you are in the right place at the right time.

No flame on Craig, he is providing a valuable resource for someone who may
have no access to these products.  Thanks Craig.
