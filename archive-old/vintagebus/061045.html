Subject: gap cap seal (friday)

hi everyone.  since it's friday, i thought it'd be interesting to hear about the weirdest or most usual seal you've found in use on your vw's gas tank cap.  this week's vw that brought me to work has a leather seal.  my bet is that the animal the seal came from probably wasn't even german.  &lt;grin&gt;

cheers,
