Subject: shims btwn. heads &amp; cylinders

So..
I guess I have to start all over **SIGH***  
I'm going to use some RTV sealant on the cylinders this time, and try to get
the pushrod tubes straight.  

I'm still wondering about those shims that were in the old heads.  (circular,
metal, gasket-type things)  I didn't use any when I put it back together.  I
don't really see why I would need to, but...   Could that be part of the problem??


Also, am I supposed to put sealant between the cylinders and heads as well??
