I think the only reason people want to know the reserve price is so that if
they want the item, they can decided right then and there if they want to
bother with bidding.  Also, by knowing the reserve, if the item doesn't make
reserve by the last few seconds of the auction, the guy who is armed with
the knowledge can send in the reserve price at the last minute and snipe the
auction without paying too much.  I always tell them anyway because if I get
reserve, I'm happy.
