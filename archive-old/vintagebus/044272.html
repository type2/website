as far as 80 cent Mexican workers, do you think they would do a worse job 
then minimium wage American workers ?  The Mexico workers really need their 
job.
And they are working with NEW parts, not &quot;rebuilt&quot; parts that may have 100K, 
200K , 300K or more unknown miles.
the cast crank should not be a problem with a stock motor and stock carb as 
it will keep the RPM down below 5000 RPM, but buzzing a cast crank at 7000 
RPM is asking for trouble.
The workers at the VW factories when I visited there in 1973 were Germans, 
Italians, Greeks and Turks. This was in the &quot;guest worker&quot; time where 
business was so good in all of Germany that they needed more workers.
