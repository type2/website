At 52MPH I signal back in international sign language,  &quot;I know that I'm a
slow moving loser white guy holding up traffic on the freeway like a
clueless illegal immygruntin in a landscaping truck and I have a fugged up
bus but the ol' lady has the good one.&quot;
The trouble is that by the time that I raise the middle finger they are
miles down the road...

talking about driving slow-   since I clocked a few hundred on the truck in
the past few days, driving slow, there is a meditative zone I get into
driving, and that truck sucks me right in.  Maybe it it the humpurr (touch
wood) of that 40hp lulling my nerves, maybe the quiet ride, especially since
they have repaved so much of I 5  (needed it for so long), maybe the soft dove
blue easy to look at dash- I even polished it, maybe it is external- the wierd
looking truck with tons of stuff in the back, people honk toot toot at me, yes
non VWs even, friendly, some try to cut me off and the d*ckw#&amp;ds can kiss my
keister cause when I signal I am sure pulling into that lane - if I wait for
someone to let me in I may miss my exit or be forced to stay in the exit only
lane and i dont want that, but I can't worry about breaking down when I pullin
front off someone n the freeway with it cause it just hasn't happened yet.
I must piss people off driving so slow, but they do seem to in general take it
extremely well, maybe the amusement value is worth it- I hope so,  I would
find watching that thing down down the road pretty entertaining.   who knows?
it's a laugh
