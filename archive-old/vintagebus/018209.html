does anyone have any tricks for installing the hardboard panels in the front
cab section of the bus?

i have been having a hell of a time getting them to fir into all the &quot;grooves&quot;
at once (the one that runs along the side of the overhead vent box) and then
above the trim panel on the outside.

i am trying to do it on the drivers side if it makes any diff.

i can get one side to fit in but when it comes to the other side, major
effort.

any suggestions??

m.
