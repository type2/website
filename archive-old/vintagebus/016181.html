Subject: 36hp, valve guide tool, springs


Hi,

Can anyone tell me where to buy a valve guide installation
tool?  Bob Hoover, in his sermons, recommended Johnny's Speed
and Chrome but I have heard that they went out of business.

Also, does anyone have specifications I could use to evaluate
the condition of the valve springs I've taken off my 36hp
cylinder heads?  Things like unloaded spring height and tension
in pounds per inch would be useful.

Thanks,

 -Dyer in Tucson
