  Although I haven't seen Jeremiah in years, I know him 
and he is a good guy. I would have no reservations doing 
business with him. The last time I saw his DC was about 
4 years ago before he restored it. I just saw it 
briefly, but it looked solid and it was at the body shop 
for a while after that.
  If I had the cash I would be on this bus in a heart 
beat!

BTW- I'm still looking for a rear bumper for my '62. Any 
leads would be appreciated!

So, you're shopping for a bus, and you've got $10k

I know from *personal* experience that you can't 
replicate a car like this for the price.
