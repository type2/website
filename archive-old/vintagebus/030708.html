Subject: Sunday questions

Well, after a week of survivalist driving the DC 70 miles daily in LA
freeway traffic last week (the waterpumper VW needed some repair),
yesterday  I got around to doing some much needed maintenance.

I finally pulled the motor  to install a shroud with functioning flaps.
I have a few thermostats, but I don't know which one to use.  What temp
range should I use with a 1600 DP with a dog house cooler.  The motor is
all stock.

I also replaced the starter that was starting to be intermittent with a
remanufactured one I found in a ghia in a junk yard.  The starter looks
brand new, and is of the self supporting type.    It looks weird sitting
there with no support on one end.  Seems to engage and spin fine, but
I've not put the motor back in to test for sure.  I've never used this
type before, anything I need to know?

I have 5 thousand on this rebuild.  Should I check end play and torque
the heads.  I have to have it running by Monday morning, and think I'll
have to pull it again if that's the case.  Too much to do between now
and then.

Thanks.

Steve
