&gt;
&gt;Wow; this has turned into a very interesting thread!!!
&gt;
&gt;While we are into glass and seals , I have yet another one for the group.  
&gt;I
&gt;am going to do the popout windows in the next month or so(I want to try and
&gt;get it all done during the dry season here in Florida).  The outer metal
&gt;frame looks pretty crusty and I suspect that after I pull the glass out and
&gt;clean them up, there will be nothng left in at least a couple of spots.
&gt;
&gt;I have been looking around the internet and in the WCM catalog.  Although I
&gt;see a source for the seals, etc I have yet to find anything for the actual
&gt;outside metal pieces.  Are they available out there somewhere??  Has
&gt;somebody out there fabricated their own (I am always up for a McGuiver)??
&gt;
&gt;Thanks in advance!!
&gt;Rich
