This weekend I went scavenging through my piles of engine tin and collected
the best pieces of the lot to go on my 1600DP which will be for my 66 bus.
I spent about 3 to 4 hours Saturday evening scraping off piles of grease and
oil (and the best tins were the ones with the most oil on them - good rust
preventative) from the tins so the gunk wouldn't collect in the sandblasting
cabinet.

This evening, the compressor ran almost constantly from 7:00 until 11:30
while I painstakingly blasted a bunch of tins.  I'm proud to say that I got
most of the tins blasted (including the fan!) excluding for the fan shroud,
upper cylinder tins, rear apron tin, and the piece that goes above the
flywheel.  I even blasted the plates that hook to the alternator.  It's
pretty darn neat to see a pile of pure grey metal tins devoid of rust and
flaking paint - it'll darn near bring you to your knees. :-)

Tomorrow I'll work on the shroud (I've scrubbed the innards for about 2
hours with hot soapy water (and have the multiple cuts on my hands to prove
it!).  The plan is to sandblast the outside of the shroud but leave the
inside alone (the part you don't see.)

Once the blasting is done, I'll be getting everything powdercoated and then
finally, I can let you all know what the bill comes to.  I don't expect
anything over $75 to have it all coated.  That's cheap for never having to
paint it again.

I'm too tired to write anymore so I'll talk to you all later...
