I have a 67 seat which is canted out near the cargo
door, but the legs do have the diagonals. I think
measuring the distance between the outer legs (center
of to center of tube) and putting that on the list for
comparison might help.

Another thing to check for on the fold-down part: late
in 67 they put a round release knob on the side of the
folding part. You pull it upward and it releases the
seat back to fold forward (like on most models 68 and
later VW seats)

naoither thing you can do if they have any of the
original upholstery is check the color charts on
Wolfsburg West and at least narrow it down to a few
years.

67 deluxe ragtop with no rag or any headliner to speak
of, black paint all over with a red beltline and
deluxe trim painted black but slowly getting stripped
back to aluminum and no idle or signals or wipers or
rubber and 180 degrees play in the steering but it has
one NOS visor.

&gt; I think like 56-66 the bottom frame changed shape
&gt; and the outter leg bowed 
&gt; out.
&gt; You need the aluminum bases for a 59.

&gt; &lt;&lt;I was comparing two 4 leg full width middle seats
&gt; and noticed that the
&gt; tubular leg that clamps to the floor near the cargo
&gt; doors is canted out a
&gt; couple of inchs on one and is vertical on the other
&gt; seat. Neither seat has a
&gt; diagonal in the frame so I think they are both split
&gt; seats. Can any one help
&gt; tell me what I have. Also I have seen stamped and
&gt; cast plates under the
&gt; middle seat. Anyone know what year they changed,
&gt; what would be correct for a
&gt; 1959.
