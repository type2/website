Subject: Re: [VB] That rattle - was this it?

oh yeah, one of the worst things you can do is put more pressure on the
shifter. this causes wear on shifting forks/operating sleeves in the
tranny, leading to popping out of gear eventually.


&gt; [Original Message]
&gt; may i suggest 2 things to maybe remedy this problem. first, check/replace
&gt; the shift rod bushing for the front shift rod. get a genuine vw one,
&gt; they're only about $5. second, try greasing the ball/ball socket of the
&gt; shifter/shift rod. pull the shifter off and pack it full down in the
&gt; socket. use good, thick, heavy grease.
&gt; another more of a PITA problem may be the 2 long shift rod bushings being
&gt; worn out. only way to fix that is to remove the tranny.

&gt; &gt; [Original Message] 
&gt; &gt; I also have an irritating rattle, comes and goes with engine vibration
&gt; (not
&gt; &gt; necessarily speed). When I put pressure on the shifter (push it further
&gt; into
&gt; &gt; the gear it is in), the rattle subsides.
