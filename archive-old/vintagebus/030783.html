Yeah, everyone will keep all the good stuff locked away until *everyone* is
there in the morning for the show / swap to start...... 8-)

&gt; Another chapter member and I went down to Red Barn last Saturday to scopethe
&gt; place and hopefully make some mental notes about parking and so
&gt; forth.

If people are showing up Friday night are they going to have to pack up and
move Saturday morning foe the show or can they set up shop Friday night and be
done with it??
