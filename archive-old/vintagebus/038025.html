Hi NQ,
The main reason for the distributor drive to be placed properly when the 
engine is at #1 TDC is to place the distributor especially the vaccume 
advance distributors in such a way as to allow timing adjustment, but not get 
locked against the intake manifold, fuel pump or other parts.
  So find where #1 TDC is and then see where the distributor drive is 
pointed.  Then install the distributor and turn till it points to the #1 mark 
on the distributor body rim.  If it does not look like it will bind against 
other parts it will be fine.  We actually turn our distributor drives a bit 
this way or that to allow our vintage German distributors to have thier ID 
plates facing directly rearwards.  Giving the engine a nicely finished look.  
After all it is a good thing.    Eric&amp;Barb
