&lt;&lt; An old timer once told me that the best way to revitalize rubber was to 
soak
 it in Coca Cola, not Pepsi, but Coke, there is some ingredients in Coke that
 will absorb in and soften the rubber back up, 15 years ago and before in my
 356 Porsche days we did this quite often with some of the obsolete rubber
 out of these vehicals and it worked, but with todays chemicals they put in
 soft drinks I can not vouch for it but it could be worth a try.
  &gt;&gt;
when I was 15 (92 or 3) my dad decides I was drinking to much pop, so he 
poors a glass, puts a big nasty hunk of fat(or maybe pork?) in it and says to 
watch it for a few days.
It --ate-- the fat/meat. big hunks missing, and he says it'll do that to your 
gut too. Don't know that it left to much of an impression about pop, still 
drink lots of it now, although I haven't eatin meat in years. not to say that 
pop would eat you rubber, just that I couldn't watch. (bus content) got my 
first bus just a month or two later, had a brand new crappy rebuild.
