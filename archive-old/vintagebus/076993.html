Subject: Follow-up on the VW event issues

Hello again VW enthusiasts,

Well, I got your messages about how VW has been treating the enthusiast community and I've certainly learned from this.  The last time I had an aircooled VW was the early 90's.  My current aircooled beetle is being restored by someone in another state (I don't have a garage).  So, this issue hasn't had not affected me - thus, my ignorance.

Anyway, for what it's worth, I sent your thoughts along to the event coordinator (Mike from Arnold - VW's ad/marketing agency) along with some unfortunate stories of current interactions betwee VWoA and customers (myself included).  

Just tought I would let you all know I passed along your concerns and we'll see what develops (but we all know nothing will).  

Take care everyone and thanks for your responses.

Laura

Hello Mike,

Well, I waded through all my e-mails and found some interesting stuff.  The aircooled community has no desire to help Volkswagen in any way by bringing their vehicles to the Living Volkswagen event.

Here's a quote from one response I received from a vintage bus community member.  All the other responses from this community just echo this.

&gt;No offense to you miss Laura but I'm sorry, and flame me if you'd &gt;like, but why the HELL would any vintage VW enthusiasts want to &gt;help VW????
&gt;
&gt;Those jokers have been trying to shut down VW related web sites &gt;for over two years.  They systematically destroyed any and all &gt;factory parts production and have actively pursued the closing down &gt;of after market parts production.  That company does not support &gt;people trying to keep older cars/busses running, and is in fact &gt;hostile towards them.  But, when they want to play on the nostalgic &gt;heart strings to get people interested in a new product, well, &gt;they're really friendly.
&gt;
&gt; Just my .02, but SCREW YOU VW!

Here's what members of a gerneral aircooled technical forum had to say:

VWoA is so screwed up.  I could give you reference to so many discussions on Vortex where people have been treated badly or just plain gotten idiotic responses when dealing with VWoA.  I, myself, got one recently when I inquired why the Driver Magazine on VW's website is so out-of-date.  Here's what I was told...

Dear Laura,

Thank you for visiting the Volkswagen website.  We are currently working
behind the scenes updating our site to reflect the 2004 model year
information.  Please keep in contact with our site, as information will
appear randomly.  We appreciate your patience during this transition.

At this time, there are no links from vwvortex_dot_com to the VW Club site.  

Thanks again for visiting vw_dot_com, Laura!

Mr. Clark Campbell,

Why do I have a current copy of the Driver Magazine and yet online through the VW Club the &quot;current&quot; Driver Magazine is still the spring/summer issue? I need to link to the magazine from the largest VW/Audi enthusiast site (VWVortex) and am unable to do so because of this outdated material.  

Come now, is that professional?

Please let me know when you have it updated and I will be greatly
appreciative.

Yours,

Laura Caligiuri

This was a complete non-answer.  It did not even speak to my question.  Another person from Vortex recently told of how they called VWoA to get a list of Phaeton approved dealers only to be told, &quot;We don't have that.  You'll have to call individual dealers and ask that.&quot;  Do you think a Mercedes S500/S600 owner who would even consider a Phaeton would be the type to open a yellow pages and start calling VW dealers?  That's lunacy.  

Anyway, all this rambling is to tell you that I don't think I'll have good luck securing a Karmann Ghia for you, but I'll still work toward this end.

Thanks for listening,

Laura
