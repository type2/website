&gt; &gt;I am going to be renting a trailer to move a 65 bus a good 800 mile and
&gt; &gt;need to get a few spec's on what sort of trailer would be required. So my
&gt; &gt;questions
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;1. How much does a 65 Bus weigh (this is just a regular van- doesn't have
&gt; &gt;all the camper equipment in it)
&gt;
&gt;Per Bentley, a Microbus weighs 1140 kg (2512 lbs).  For reference, the
&gt;heaviest Bus they list is a DIN-spec ambulance at 1280 kg (2822 lbs).
&gt;
&gt; &gt;2. How &quot;wide&quot; is the bus (i.e what sort of width would thr trailer have
&gt; &gt;to be)
&gt;
&gt;A Deluxe is 1.8m wide, 4.3m long, and 1.94m high when empty per Bentley
&gt;again.  That's about 6 feet by 14.5 feet by 6.5 feet.
&gt;
&gt; &gt;3. Finally would a double axle trailer be sufficient or would a tri axle
&gt; &gt;be preferable?
&gt;
&gt;A double-axle trailer with minimum 14&quot; wheels would be probably be OK.
&gt;It really depends on the load rating of the axles and tires.  Most
&gt;rental trailers I have seen are the two-axle kind.
&gt;
&gt; &gt;Any other tips for a realtively inexperienced trailer tower would be
&gt; &gt;apprecaited.
&gt;
&gt;http://www.type2_dot_com/library/misc/towee.htm has some good info.
&gt;
&gt;My personal story: I towed my Bus from Houston to Tulsa when I bought
&gt;it in July 2000.  I used a double-axle flatbed trailer from U-Haul and
&gt;one of their smaller trucks (empty).  Most rental places have restrictions
&gt;on the towing vehicle and the total weight of the entire rig; they may
&gt;not let you tow a Bus with a pickup, or they might insist on a one-ton
&gt;pickup.  On U-Haul's Web site you can type in the trailer you're using,
&gt;the towed vehicle, and the towing vehicle, and it will tell you whether
&gt;they allow it or not.
&gt;
&gt;Unless you know for sure that the rear axle of the '65 is in perfect
&gt;shape, you probably want a flatbed trailer - all four wheels of the
&gt;Bus are on the trailer.  The alternative is a &quot;dolly&quot; or &quot;car carrier&quot;
&gt;that only supports the front wheels of the Bus - the back wheels of
&gt;the Bus roll on the road.
&gt;
&gt;If you're not sure if the '65 runs, make sure you bring something with
&gt;you that can get the Bus up on to the trailer, like a manual winch.  I
&gt;didn't do this and had to do some work to get the Bus up on the trailer -
&gt;I unhooked the trailer from the truck and used the truck to pull the Bus
&gt;on to the trailer, then had to hook the trailer back up.
&gt;
&gt;The trailer should have straps or chains to tie the Bus down with, or
&gt;at least a place they can be attached.  Put the straps or chains around
&gt;the torsion bars, front and back.  Be careful of nearby breakable things
&gt;like brake lines.  Make sure you have more than one thing holding the
&gt;Bus to the trailer, and that all chains/straps/rope are fairly tight.
&gt;
&gt;Make sure the trailer lights work OK, both when you get the trailer and
&gt;while you're traveling.
&gt;
&gt;Make sure that at least the driver's door of the Bus will clear the sides
&gt;or wheel-wells of the trailer when it is opened.  Because of where the
&gt;doors on a Bus are, 99.9% of Bus/trailer combinations will have no
&gt;problems with this.  Also, on many Buses, you could crawl in and out
&gt;through the back if you have to.  This is more of a problem with low
&gt;vehicles like Bugs, Ghias, etc.
&gt;
&gt;When you're driving the towing vehicle, pretend like you have no reverse
&gt;gear - only drive in to places that you can drive straight out of again.
&gt;People who drive trucks for a living can back up with a trailer and make
&gt;it go exactly where they want it but I know I can't.  Use the brakes
&gt;early, and don't forget that the overall rig is very long - you can't
&gt;make sharp turns at intersections, you have to drive the truck out into
&gt;the intersection a little and *then* start turning.
&gt;
&gt;Good luck!
&gt;
