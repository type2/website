I understand my mistake. I know what the throw out bearing is. Thing that I
was looking for is not a bushing but the bearing that's attached to the
solenoid operating lever. I thing it's pinion. Idiot book calls it pinion.
Are these available?


Thanks,

&gt; yes there is.  actually you need to bring the old one to the store with
you
&gt; when you get it, as the inner diameter depends on the size (V) of the
&gt; starter, and the outer diameter depends on the trans, whethr it was
&gt; originally 6V or 12V.   so easiest to bring the old one in, as there are 4
&gt; sizes.  The bushings are pretty cheap though.    You are talking about the
&gt; bushing where the nose of the starter goes to the trans?
&gt; the throw out bearing is between the tranns and the clutch.
