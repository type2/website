Subject: RE: [VB] Throwout bearing Q

What BRAND t/o bearing did you get? Whats funny is my parts book doesn't
even list either of the numbers you posted. It list a 111 141 167C as the
correct t/o bearing. I also looked in all my parts vendor catalogs and the
only t/o bearing they list is the 111 141 165A for 1955 to 1967 type 2's.
Just make sure you got a GERMAN one and not a Mexico or Brazil one.

Subject: [VB] Throwout bearing Q


I just received a 111 141 165A a throwout without the plastic ring, just a
ball bearing. Am I far better off with the 111 141 165 C ? I assume since
it's 64 up to have it anyway, I am using an older part if I use this, and my
clutch might be noisy. Looking for durability foremost...
TIA
Al
