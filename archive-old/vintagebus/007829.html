Almost thought that link was a joke:)
The spelling is incorrect, though. It should be www.gutefahrt_dot_com

&gt;
&gt; Hi Susan,
&gt; Which type of roof rack?  Westie, German or VOA rack to name just a small
few!
&gt;
&gt; &lt;&lt;  Also, a working Sapphire radio with mounting frame for a 1967 (the
longer
&gt; opening).  Complete, please.  &gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Sapphire III which was AM only or Sapphire IV which was FM and AM?  There
&gt; were many other radios that the dealer would sell also!  You should check
out
&gt; the GuteFarht_dot_com websight for thier images of VW radios!
&gt;
&gt; &lt;&lt;An emergency flasher switch for 12v. &gt;&gt;
&gt; Which part number or at least how many wires hooks up to it?  There
&gt; apperently was a N. American market one and another Euro one that used
many
&gt; more wires.
