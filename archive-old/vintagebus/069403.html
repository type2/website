Subject: RE: [VB] Sub hatch in 1965?

  Rich Yost had a 65 (maybe 64) sub hatch Westy at the classic last year,
very clean and dry original bus sans original interior. If you look up pics
(on the samba) of the classic weekend Irvine Lake campout there are some
pics of it

&lt;&lt;   No Clara, the bus you are thinking of that we had was a late 1964 model

 Kombi with dealer installed SO-33 Westie interior.  If it had had the 
 sub-hatch it probably would have not left our stable of VWs!  That was one 
 nice OG about 70,000 mile complete bus, and we are still upset that it got 
 totalled when it was rear ended in a freak coincidence by the landlord of 
the 
 new owner.  ;-(

I remember it was a nice bus, wasn't it really solid?   I was surprised that

a big back hatch bus was an early westy, I had thought the cut off was 63 at

the time.
