&gt; OK... been puttin up with this since I got the truck
&gt; ('62 S/C)... On a hard take off, not tire smokin or
&gt; nothin, just a hard acceleration from a dead stop, or
&gt; takin off pullin a heavy load, why does it wheel hop
&gt; so bad? Its all stock.... not lowered, or raised. Does
&gt; it have anything to do with the drive axles turnin
&gt; backwards, is it just a truck thing, or am I way
&gt; off... The real question is there anything that can be
&gt; installed to prevent it. Its really annoying.

Yes, it is due to the fact that the drive axles turn backwards and that
trucks are light in the rear end.
In a bug, or any other rear wheel drive car without reduction boxes, the
torque of the axle rotation lowers the rear end under hard acceleration.
Because the bus axles rotate the opposite direction, they raise the rear
end. Accelerate hard enough and the wheels come off the ground when the
suspension hits its limit. Good shocks will help a lot to reduce this
problem.
