 I have a '70 westy that needs a new steering box.  My mechanic checked his
 sources &amp; found they are no longer carrying them because the ones they used
 to do were TRW rebuilt boxes and apparently peices of cr*p.
 
 Not wanting to put cr*p in my bus, I thought I would defer to the list to
 see if anyone can recommend a good source for these!
 
 Thanks,

er- someone I know just got a decent used STGBox for their 69 westy for $45 
from a junkyard- it was even pulled for them.  Then again the box that they 
got with the bus was awful, reall real real bad.

think it is the same 68-72.
