 I have a question that has always bothered me. Lots of people talk of
80,000, 100,00 or more miles on there engines, how long did it take to get
there?

  From what I have read and seen, very few Western states people really
drive there buses that much or any long distances on a regular basis

ps. How many of you keep a log on your bus
===============
I only drive ACVWs, but as I have several that run and drive I swap around 
which I drive.   Each has a little spiral bound notebook &amp; I write down every 
time I put gas in it, and any thing done to it.   Done that for years and 
years and years.   I picked up the habit when I had a 59 w/o a gas guage and 
the little trip meter thing started sticking.     But since I am not driving 
just one, it is less that 10K /yr /VW. 

Dunno why you say west coast folks don't daily drive buses - oh- because you 
don't live on the west coast and dont see all the buses driven around here.  
There are lots of non-listee, non-VW show going people who use buses (even 
splitties) as daily drivers.  I see more buses on the road in Oly than I did 
in Havasu, mostly bays ya, but a few splits.  Alway been more bays on the 
road, they made more of them.
