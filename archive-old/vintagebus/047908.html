Hi all,
     I am replacing the starter in my 61dd and I am using a used
starter.
     Before I install it I wanted to test it.When I wire it up the gear
pushes out but does not spin.
     Does this mean the starter is shot ?Does it need a load to turn ?
            Thanks in advance, woody.

the vw starter are not self supporting so you should not test it by itself.
I have a piece cut off a tran bell housing I can bolt to the starter that
supports the unself sporrtted thingy.     I test mine with a battery charger
i think usually at 10 apms.      If unsupported I am told it cn self destruct
