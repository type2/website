Hey everybody,
Well, as many of you probly know, I'll be leaving soon on an epic
voyage.  A road trip from Vancouver, BC [that's in Canada, eh
;-)] down to Knoxville, Tennessee to get a '66 Westy.  On the way
down, I'll be travelling in a big red '74 school bus with 4
friends, (4 wimmin, 1 guy total) one dog, and one Volkswagen
motor for the aforementioned veedub.
The following (part 1) is our approximate route on the way down
to Tennessee.  If anybody knows of any VW shows along the way I'd
love to try and get to them, although we may be shunned for
showing up in a propane-powered school bus.  Part 2, my route
home in the '66 Westy with my dog, will be in my next post.
Diana
'66 parts bus
'66 Westy (almost)

Part 1:

April 17 - We leave Vancouver, heading to Albuquerque as quickly
as possible for our first stop.
We'll cross the border and go thru Washington, crossing into
Oregon on I-82.
Next we take I-84 through Idaho and into Utah.
&gt;From Utah, we cut across the southwest corner of Colorado and
then straight on into New Mexico and Albuquerque, the Gathering
of Nations Pow-wow.
We're not sure where we're going to stop, some of my friends are
hoping to make it to Utah before really stopping??  But we need
to be in Albuquerque by April 21at the latest, so we'll be in a
hurry.

After Albuquerque, we get to relax a little more.
We'll leave New Mexico, taking the I-40 into Texas.
In Texas, we pass through Amarillo, Austin, and go around Houston
(looks scary) before crossing into
Lousiana along I-10.  In LA we hit Lafayette and then probably
Houma before our second stop-
New Orleans, where we hope to catch the last weekend of the jazz
festival May 1-2.

Leaving New Orleans, we will hopefully be EXTREMELY relaxed and
taking our time:
We'll backtrack through Baton Rouge, then head up to
Natchez, Mississippi and the Natchez Parkway, which we hear is a
nice scenic route for our slow old school bus.
The Natchez Parkway will take us up across the northwest corner
of Alabama, and then,
Finally, into Tennessee.  The parkway ends south of Nashville,
then we'll head on over to Knoxville from there.
Stop 3: The infamous BUS!!!!  Time to insert motor and begin
experimentation and adjustment before the long journey home.
