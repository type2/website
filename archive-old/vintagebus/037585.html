&lt;&lt;Another thing strange to me is the the jack point and outrigger in the

bottom pic on the page seem strange,, outrigger has what looks like a bead

along the edge to the frame, and it seemd to extend a bit below the frame

more than normal , all i get original are spot welded, next i don't see the

pressed sections in the jackpoint for water drainage or what ever thay call

it,, anyway just my .02 cents worth, maybe i need new glasses,i dunno.Later
