&gt; .I have found prices to vary greatly. Has anybody purchased
&gt; TMI panels or Westcoast classic restoration? Any input would be
&gt; appreciated.  Jim

  If you are going custom then TMI or Sewfine make a nice &quot;reasonably &quot;priced
product.
But if you want them to be as close as possible to stock then the best I've
seen are West Coasts Classics.W.C.C.phone is 714-871-1322,Lenny is the man!
