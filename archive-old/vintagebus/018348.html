Ronnie has different arms and mirrors available,
as I recall.  I bought repro arms from Peninsula Automotive,
but I went with the funky &quot;harp&quot; mirror arms.

The trick isn't so much in *installing* them, it's in removing
your old ones.

&gt; arm for the round mirror for my 65 double cab, and I
&gt; am wondering what the differences are in the repro
&gt; arms.  I noticed that at least one supplier has them
&gt; in stainless steel, but that might look odd unless I
&gt; also replace the driver side arm too.
&gt; So, what are the list recommendations for sources of
&gt; the arms, and anyone have any hints not already given
&gt; for installing them?
