&gt; &quot;'68 Eriba Puck $4500. see VWPlanet ad&quot; 
&gt; 
&gt; Is it me or is VWPlanet impossible to navigate and
&gt; the search does not work.
&gt; Too fancy for its own good...  I have no idea who
&gt; runs this site, so please
&gt; take it as constructive criticism.  Is there a
&gt; detailed explanation on how
&gt; to view information about the Puck...  For the
&gt; simple minded people like
&gt; myself :)
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Also has anyone built/restored one of those teardrop
&gt; trailers for towing
&gt; behind a VW bus?  It seems that if a VW bus can tow
&gt; a Puck it can handle a
&gt; teardrop.  Any good links or stories would be
&gt; appreciated. 
&gt; 
&gt; If I build/get a Puck or teardrop I would definitely
&gt; put on front disc
&gt; brakes and switch to type4 2.0 power.  
&gt; 
&gt; Also this is a super stretch, but has anyone seen a
&gt; VW bus pulling a
&gt; Airstream Bambi 16-17' trailer?   They are light for
&gt; what they are, but
&gt; probably too much for a VW at about 2300 pounds..?
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks,
