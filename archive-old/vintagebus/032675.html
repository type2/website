after a beautiful, foggy morning her on the monterey peninsula, and doing a
few errands in my '61 Westy, and meeting another bus owner with a '64(late)
13 window, i decided to wash my bus in preparation for a possible trip to
seattle. 
i washed the bus and somewhere during that process i decided it was due for
its first wax job.  the fog was breaking up, so i figured i'd better hurry,
or i'd be in direct sunlight (a waxing no-no, according to the directions.
do you think they did research on that, or just guessed?) so i dried the
bus and began applying the green stuff.  what a chore!  wax on-wax off, let
it dry, crampy hands, nooks and crannies, geez! i thought it'd be easy!  i
just barely got done when the sun totally burned off the fog, and only had
to do the front while it was sunny, but the front was in the shade.
looks pretty good, i think.
anyway, i'm glad wax lasts a while, because i don't feel like doing that
again any time soon.  my hat is off to all you show car (a.k.a. garage
queen) guys/girls. you guys/girls are NUTS!!! i see you doing this alot,
and it s&amp;^ks!
off to seattle tomorrow?!?
