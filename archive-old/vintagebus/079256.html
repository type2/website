Subject: 2nd gear pops out

   Time for me to chime in. Give me a call and we can discuss driving habits, engine size, bus load, normal climate in 
your area and I can figure out which trans greaing is best for you.
  I have a different geared trans in 6 of my driving buses with different engines in each also. I have swapped engines 
into different buses to see what the difference would be, yadaa yadaa yadaa. I have probaly tried more gear and 
engine combo's in split buses then anybody (driven them 1000's of miles in testing), never 2 the same and pretty much 
which combo's work best in each situation.  
  Currently testing a straight axle with 4.12 r/p 1.23 (approx) 3rd and .89 4th having a 3.88 built with a 1.31 (approx) 
3rd and an .77 4th to help compensate for the 25 inch tall tires in the rear.
  Also am having a 3.44 r/p with the 1.23 (approx) and .89 4th to mate to a 1600 with duel SCAT solex kit engine (my 
favorite trans gearing) 

I love gear ratio's and buses

&gt;&gt; Ditto on going with a Rancho from Ronnie - I did that about 2yrs ago

&gt;&gt; have been very happy with it.  Ronnie was very helpful and the tranny
&gt;&gt; is 
&gt;&gt; going strong.  As the list knows all too well (from my loads of
&gt;&gt; quavering 
&gt;&gt; posts), I yanked the tranny, rebuilt the RGBs, but let Rancho handle
&gt;&gt; the 
&gt;&gt; tranny.

&gt;I will definately consider the Rancho guys. Ronnie has some real decent
&gt;prices for 'em and he's not that far away - I could pick it up. If I do,
&gt;maybe it would be a good opportunity to spend the extra money on a &quot;freeway
&gt;flyer&quot;? But I'm a little worried about that with the reduction boxes still
&gt;in...'anyone else think that would be an issue?
