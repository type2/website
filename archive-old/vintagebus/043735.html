&gt;well, I have done this a number of times, and the case hasn't cracked yet.
&gt; [...] I have also driven from off the freeway down the parkway and there
&gt;was a huge puddle

I wasn't thinking about that but yeah, it'd be a lot more common to hit 
a puddle with a hot engine and if this was going to crack cases it would
probably have done so already.

I had heard a story of a motorcycle crankcase being cracked by a
hot-off-the-highway wash attempt, but again, they hit puddles too.

Maybe I just worry too much.  :)
