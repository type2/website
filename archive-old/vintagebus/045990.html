Hi Charles,
Actually those early doors were used even up into the first third or so of 64 
year model production.  We are guessing that your's is a later 64.  The only 
way to install the early front doors is to cut part of the body frame so you 
can weld in the earlier door latch striker area!  In otherwords if you want 
the earlier exterior door handles you should buy an earlier bus.    Eric&amp;Barb
