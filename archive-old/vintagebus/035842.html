&lt;&lt; How much play should I feel in the transaxle input shaft (Todd?) &gt;&gt;

Hello,

As little as possible.  More play usually indicates that the input
shaft seal is not doing its job as good as it used to and that can
lead to seepage.

New clutch arms are the gold cad plated jobs from parts unknown.
They are OK as far as quality goes but are not as good as the
original ones were when brand new.  I personally do not like the
red urethane bushings and suggest the solid bronze/oilite types.
I have noticed on the new arms that the groove for the snap rings
can be a bit shallow and allow the rings to 'pop' out.  A crude but
effective method is to use a hacksaw to deepen it.
