Subject: reserve valve
Date: Mon, 9 Oct 2000 12:34:11 -0500
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

So I was puttering around with that today - and I noticed that when the
reserve knob is pushed all the way in the lever on the valve does not go all
the way up.  So I disconnected the cable and pushed the lever all of the way
up and it started leaking really bad.  Yet, when it is in the half way
position or the reserve position - no leaks - hmmm.

what could it be - I just filled up so I think I'll wait a bit to pull the
valve off.  But are there any sort of rebuild kits available for these
things?  or can I make a seal?  I did make a new cork gasket for it and that
seems to be working OK.
