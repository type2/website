&gt;Ah, it's so hard to find a $1.00 part for a buck anymore.   Back when I
&gt;was a kid I'd make redux plugs out of rocks,  That's right, I'd shape
&gt;them with my fingernails while I was walking to school. ten miles through
&gt;the snow, uphill, both ways, yup.

You forgot &quot;while chasing the polar bears and Yeti off with a stick&quot;.

The thing I wonder about, though, is after you made the plug, where did
you get the oil to fill the RGBs back up?  I mean, since the dinosaurs
had only been dead for a couple of years, wasn't crude oil hard to come
by?
