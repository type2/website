You've seen my Crew Cab Clara. It is the tan colored one. It is actually a Toyota color. It
has a brown interior and a cool wood stearing wheel. I have a white metal rack on it and
sometimes have the bows and hoops on it. I still don't have a canvasI have had to a bunch of
the NW Shows. I guess the last couple of years I either had the Deluxe or the Thing. It has
some rust in the rockers but pretty darn solid overall. Just recently has all new brakes, new
freeway flyer tranny and a new 1776. I am thinking of tearing it down and doing a complete
repaint on it over this summer. I am leaning towards Palm Green lower with a Sand Green upper.
All I need now is a really nice rear slash bumper with over riders. I have a few nice front
slash bumpers and a really good rear point bumper I could trade.
