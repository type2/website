Steve,

    RMMW lists them as:
    &quot;211 501 249, Plug, Gear Reduction Housing, L or R, '64-'67 type II,
$4.95 ea....&quot;
    1-800-258-1996 is their #.
    you were looking for *plugs*, but no affiliation whatsoever.... :)
    A reliable source told me before that they were actually called &quot;welch
plugs&quot;... the dictionary tells me that's a variant of &quot;welsh&quot;... leading me
to think that the welch plug was thought up by someone from Wales, or has
something to do with &quot;welching on a deal&quot;... *failing* for a practical
explanation.... i.e. the plug will fail first before extreme pressure
grenades your redux box or w*sserboxer block or what-have-you.
    something like that...
    If Providence has smiled upon you, the plug will have rusted from the
outside in instead of the other way around... take a decent look at the
metal you'll see upon removing the old plugs.
    Some of the hard chrome varieties of piston rings are coated with iron
oxide to help them break in. The stuff is abrasive, and none too good for
the bearings in your redux box...

later....

*being a certain percentage of Irish, I have to wonder if the welch-Welsh
thing was some kind of ethnic slur. hmmm... something of a little mystery to
be unraveled someday for the enterprising linguist.

steve saith:
&gt;Are replacements available??  If not, does anyone know of a good
&gt;replacement?  Freeze plug maybe??
