My generator pulley grenaded halfway between Davis and Vacaville.  I 
tried to limp it back, but 5 miles from home it gave out, had to get a tow.
I'm going to put a new pulley on and try to continue in my quest, but
it's probably not worth it to roll into Red Barn that late.   I can
still make the dinner and KP though.  Hopefully my generator isn't mangled
from the experience.

Normally I kept a spare pulley in my parts stash, but somehow it walked
away.  This would have been a fairly easy roadside fix.
