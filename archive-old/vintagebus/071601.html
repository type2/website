Subject: oil change - part III = rebuild

Ok, I have accepted the fact that I need a rebuild.  I was actually planning
on doing it this winter.  i am not afraid to get my hands dirty and I am no
stranger to tools or VW's.  Are there any decent kits available?  I would
probably like to go a bit more than a 1600.  I also understand the bennefits
of balancing.   I am a newbie when it comes to rebuilding and engine.
Anyone want a new student?
