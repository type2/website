&gt;&gt;the question i have
&gt;&gt; is what size is that castle nut on the rear axle? i am borrowing an
&gt;&gt; impact wrench and need to get a socket. i was thinking 40mm.
&gt;
&gt;Debate on the list says that it is 41mm or 42mm.  It's been stated
&gt;that a 1-5/8 socket will work.

the 41mm vs. 42mm debate (I conceeded that it probably is 41mm) was the
nut holding the stub axle with the lower reduction gear to the reduction
box.

The &quot;castle&quot; outer axle nut that holds the drum to the axle is 46mm.
