&gt; Thanks for your reply.  So should the metal line from the tank be attached
&gt; to the bodywork under the tank ?(on the underneath though)

Hi Paul,
There should be a couple of tabs spot welded to the underside of the shelf 
the fuel tank sits on.  These tabs hold the fuel line from laying down on the 
tranny and control cables which can saw through the fuel line.  

&gt; I definately haven't got that piece to prevent the vibration - I will have 
&gt; to borrow my friends and try and fabricate my own or pick one up from 
&gt; somewhere.

This anti-vibration bracket and the tabs under the gas tank shelf must have 
sections of fuel line slit lengthwise around the metal fuel lines to prevent 
any metal to metal contact!!!!
