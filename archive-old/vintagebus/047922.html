Subject: Re: [VB] Empi five spokes won't fit.
To: VintageBus_at_type2_dot_com

For the last year or so I have had a pair of  5-spoke Empi look-alikes on the 
rear of my '61 DC.  They have Sears Guardsman 165-15 radials on them.  There 
is about 3/8&quot; clearance from the tire sidewall to the folded under lip of the 
fender opening.  I have watched this clearance throughout the full range of 
suspension travel and it never gets any closer.  I made a pair of spacers on 
a lathe, to move the aluminum center caps out enough to clear the axle nut 
(biggest problem of the whole thing).  

As for the fronts, there is no way the 5-spokers will fit on the earlier 
drums.  They do fit on the later ('64 &amp; up) drums and I have a pair of them 
waiting for me to get around to it.  You need to change everything, 
though.....backing plates, cylinders, shoes and all.  I have been told that 
there should be no problem using these as long as I use the wheel bearings 
that are presently in use.  Perhaps someone on the list can verify/clarify 
this???
