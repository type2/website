Another way to tighten up the collar is to take a piece of glass and a piece 
of wet and dry(any sand paper will work)and sand the clamping collar down a 
bit. Hold down with seady pressure to get a flat sand job(sanding in circles 
helps keep a flat surface)and reassemble. If still loose sand a little more 
till it fits tight around the steering column. Tape works but some get 
slippery in hot weather and makes a mess.
