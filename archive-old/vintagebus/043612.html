&gt;I was at the local FLAPS (Pozzis VW) yesterday, and he told me of a 
&gt;single cab that just went up on his For Sale board.

Let's review this deal...

1) You have 3 VWFLAPS within ~5 miles of your house.  (Kind of
   incidental, but a mind-boggling concept to people out in the
   sticks like me, NQ, and Rex Rogers.)

2) You got a pretty clean, straight, tagged, *running and driving* 
   single-cab, plus a spare gate, PLUS a 36hp engine, *PLUS* a 
   /complete/ 25hp engine, for $1000. 

3) Despite the fact that said single-cab is approaching 46 years old,
   *you were able to drive it home*.

All I can say is that the Bus gods are smiling on you.  Maybe all the 
work you do for the list and on vintagebus_dot_com is being noticed.  :)

&gt;He'd stalled the '60 at a stop sign, and of course, with no battery, 
&gt;he was SOL.

And you didn't just hook up a tow rope and pull-start him?  :)

Congratulations!!
