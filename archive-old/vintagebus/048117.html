 i need a bit of info that i dont have. does anyone nkow if the 67 interior 
 lights are the same as the 66 interior lights for kombi's? any help is 
 appreciated.

 66 kombi

same from mid 55 (somewhat post barndoor) through 67- the aluminium bulb 
holder - and takes the same plastic cover with which you must use 5W bulb of 
the same voltage as your system because other wise the covers get melted.
