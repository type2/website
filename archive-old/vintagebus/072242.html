Subject: Re: [VB] Rear facing lights

http://thesamba_dot_com/vw/gallery/index.mv?photo+89358.jpg

is a reverse light I added to my 65 westy.  No drilling needed.  It is very 
bright.  It is very helpful in backing around in dark driveways etc.   I added 
a similar light to my '61 15 window, attached to a bolt holding the overriders 
to the upright, having bent the 67 style bug reverse light brace into the 
shape I wanted.   Not stock, but I don't think it looks out of place at all.   
Note the OEM VW plug in thingy (visible under the overrider) so when I remove 
the bumper all I have to do is un plug the wire, really easy.   I installed this 
a couple (?) years ago.   When I replaced the trannys on both buses I put in 
67 nose cones, and eventually added reverse lights.     

 For fog lights you could add a pair with red lenses and a switch up front.   
Red plastic lenses are available repro if you don't want to shell out for the 
glass lenses from brake light decklid buses.
