&gt; Seems that there's a few federal statutes dating from the late
&gt; seventies (here in the US of A) against falsifying the mileage of a vehicle.

Old VW's, or any car for that matter, are exempt from mileage verification here in
California. So I'm sure you'll be safe. Not to mention the little box that says,
&quot;not actual mileage&quot;.  If you &quot;disclose&quot; to the buyer or whoever that the mileage
was changed you're safe too!

I looked into all of that when I started doing speedo restorations. I wanted to
make sure I wouldn't get &quot;the Man&quot; after me....
