Yeah, well, we all get nervous sometimes.  I
occasionally get a pang of nervousness when I'm about
to head to S.D. or Breckenridge or Winter Park in my
'67 deluxe.  But then, I just look back on my college
days (ummm, say, 1980), when I put together a '66 from
New Mexico; which I purchased for $100 with no motor,
with a '64 from New York, which I purchased for $20 (I
had to return the tires).  The '64 had been sitting
for at least 10 years when I bought it, and I just
brought down a battery and had a friend drive it home
(with the walls flapping in the breeze due to the rust
on that Westy)!  I put the motor from the '64 into the
'66 and just started driving it!

Lots went wrong over time (for one thing, she was
undecided about her voltage for a while, ending up
12v) but I was always able to fix it, on a tight
budget, and I ultimately sold that bus to my old buddy
Steiner, who not only drove it from upstate NY to
Denver, but even sent his mom and sister on a trip
alone from Malone to Syracuse.  That bus made many,
many road trips, with very marginal mechanical
practices (yes, I once took all the best heads I could
find and all the best valves, and used lapping
compound and a drill to seat the best of the old
valves into the best of the old heads.  Non-precision
stuff like that.)

So anyway, the point is, that when I sold that bus to
Steiner, it took me 1/2 hour to explain all the things
I KNEW were wrong with the bus. Steiner ignored them
all and arrived in Denver with failing spark plug
wires.  Now, with my '67, I have a list of what I know
is wrong, but it's a much shorter list, and she hasn't
let me down yet.  (Okay once, but Stuart and I were
able to fix it lying on an Indian blanket on the
hardpack snow on the side of the road in Breckenridge,
CO in December.  Throttle linkage fell apart.)  It can
always happen, but hey, it's not a car, it's an
adventure!

&gt; Hello All, 
&gt; 
&gt;       Well here's where I'm at. I have 19 days left
&gt; until my maiden
&gt; voyage of 507 miles round trip to BNNTA. This is my
&gt; first trip of any
&gt; length in my bus, and I'm a little nervous.
