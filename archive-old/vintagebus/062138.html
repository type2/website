Subject: Re: [VB] Fuel Pump Install

  Clamp the inlet fuel line, remove fuel lines from pump.  Unscrew the two 13 
mm nuts.  It probably helps to take the distributor cap off. There is a push 
rod that sticks up through the Bakelite base, just leave it there.  Turn both 
new and old fuel pumps over, and look where the rod goes and pushes the 
mechanism that should be the same height in each, other wise you got the 
other kind of fuel pump that takes the other kind of rod (two sorts fit 1600 
motors).  Push the mechanism and feel the pump pump air out of one of the 
spouts-now you know which is out.  Pack grease where the rod pushes the 
mechanism.  Pack it, mush the grease into the works with your little finger.  
(grease is good.  greease greease grease.)
I use a new gasket between the base and pump and paint the brown sealing goo 
permatex.  I like to use enough fuel line for it to go around the coil and 
hang the filter out of the way of the wiring.

Inspect fuel lines for age and cracks.  Replace if necessary.  Attach the in 
and out of the pump correctly.   Do a check around the engine compartment- 
wires snug- plug wires connected, cap on?  Okay.

&lt;&lt; Hey Y'all,
 On a 1600 Dp engine, is fuel pump installation as easy as simple removing the
 two bolts at the base of the fuel pump and removing it, then reverse for
 install? Or are there other parts (push rod) that actually go INSIDE the
 engine, thus creating an internal engine procedure (out of my league!)
