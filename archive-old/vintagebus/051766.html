Subject: Re: [VB] Tom Conners' Roof Racks!

I must concur... My 6'0&quot; was the greatest addition I've made to my bus. 
I love it!  I leave on all the time, even in the PNW rain.  He told me
the wood coat should last 2 years.  If it lasts one, I'll happily reapply
the marine sealer.  Woohoo.  It's sturdy, too.  I park myself and my
daughter up there at the beach when we go.  (You can drive on the beach
here)  Just roll a carpet out and kick back.  Enjoy it!
