Subject: Rusty Bumper's, Hub Caps, Beauty rings &amp; Penetrol

Here ya go guys--
For those of you who drive all winter long, and have a surface rusting
problem ( or want to retard this stuff from rusting ) on your chrome
bumper's, original VW &quot;moon&quot; hub caps --and if you have them--the
genuine stainless made in who knows where beauty rings--

Take the finest steel wool you can buy--0000 or 00000 grade--and soak it
in Penetrol--wipe the soaked steel wool on the surface rust--
BANG !!
The rust is gone !!
Let it dry for about 15 minutes--wipe the excess off--and your done.

If your appling the Penetrol to the bumper's on a Vanagon--don't be
afraid to get it on the rubber's---wipe them down with the stuff
too--It'll make the rubber look new--and it'll last.

It really worked good on my &quot;Genuine&quot; made in DeutschChina moon caps and
bumper's I got from a popular list vendor that rusted faster than the
bent factory one's I had--

They rusted as soon as the got wet--
A coat of this miracle in a can works well--and stopped the problem--

I knew this stuff was good for more than just the fiberglass on the pop
top's of my Westies--

Try it on your faded black door handle's too--it'll make them look real
nice--don't go trying to get into your vehicle until it's dr
though--pretty sticky stuff--
 

Later,

            ______________
