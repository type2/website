Subject: where to buy sheet metal
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

hello all,

i know this question has been asked a million times,
however in the archives it is hard to really find the
answer to it.

i bought my first bus nearly a year ago and have let
it sit since. so far what i can tell it needs both
sides, inner and outer rocker panels, both rear lower
corner panels (about top of the tailight down on the
left and under the tailight down on the right) front
right cab floor, and that floor section above the
right rocker panel where the door is. when i bought it
the floors were still good and everything looked
really good. i then proceeded to poke at some bubble
rust and found that everything i mentioned above was
covered in super thick bondo hiding the horrible rust
under it. (suprisingly the floors and frame still have
the factory grey paint and are very solid, as well as
the doglegs)
now from restoring my other vws i know there is a huge
difference in where you buy the metal with quality and
fit in mind. what im looking for is something that is
decent, certainly nothing that is nos or custom
precision made or anything way exspensive but somthing
close to a good fit. in your opinions where is a good
place? pretty blunt but i need a lot of help and input
on this one- maybe this bus is a little hard being my
first full on do-it my self project but i am
determined. maybe one day ill see everyone at a show
and thank them for all ther help
                      thanks a bunch
