An alternative is something like Otmar ?'s stretch Vanagon
(http://www.evcl_dot_com/vw/), a conventional engine in the rear (could be a
biodiesel), with electric FWD, using a syncro front drive system. For trips,
and for charging, the conventional engine is used, for city driving, or the
occasional 4WD needs, the front electric drive is used.

This one always seemed like a great idea to me, looks better than any other
stretch bus I've seen pics of, too (IMHO).

Subject: [VB] Friday and EV in CA


&gt; Since it is Friday and we are a little OT with the bio-diesel anyway, I
&gt; thought it natural to bring up the EV (Electric Vehicle) situation in CA.
&gt;
&gt; Did anyone read the latest Car &amp; Driver article about the failure of
&gt; electric cars and how CAB (CA Clean Air Board or something similar) is
still
&gt; pushing for these by 2003.  I laughed and cried while reading that
article.
&gt; Needless to say CA or the automakers are screwed because there is no
&gt; feasible ways to make these cars or market for these cars.  The EV1 and
EV2
&gt; GM produced cost 1.0-1.5 million to make each and leaved them for about
&gt; $35,000.  Plus isn't CA having power outages anyway?  What do people think
&gt; these EV run on, and it takes 6 hours to charge for only 75-100 miles.
&gt;
&gt; The whole thing is laughable.
&gt;
&gt; I did see the SULEV cars to be a practical solution.  C&amp;D drew a
comparison
&gt; of the hydrocarbon pollution produced by spilling one pint of gas on the
&gt; ground is the same for a SULEV car driving 100,000 miles... Crazy!!!  In a
&gt; good way :)  In comparison, a poorly tuned pre-emissions vehicle is
supposed
&gt; to do the same damage in about 20 miles of driving...  I wonder if that
&gt; applies to our flat fours?  Maybe we can go 40 miles before giving off the
&gt; same hydrocarbons?
&gt;
&gt; Something to chew on for Friday...  Still really like this homebrew
&gt; bio-diesel idea though :)
