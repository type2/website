&gt; &gt;Well, not all that new, but the prices have come down to the point
&gt; &gt;where they are becoming very practical for a lot of folks.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;My wife (bless her heart) gifted me with a Garmin GPSIII+ for
Father's
&gt; &gt;day.

&gt;  Nice add-on George . . .
&gt; 
&gt;  What kind of price range with all the goodies is the Garmin ?

About $350 for the GPSIII+, plus $90 for each CDROM (the one I have
has street-level detail for the entire US)

&gt;  That 100 meters . . I heard that . . I can only guess they are
&gt; jiggering the readout for coordinates . .

No, the Department of Defense (who owns the satellites) adds error to
the signal to stop folks from using the &quot;consumer&quot; signal for
targeting their weapons, at least that is the theory.  The &quot;military&quot;
signal has an accuracy measured in fractions of a centimeter!

You can buy &quot;differential GPS&quot; units that correct the error with an
additional signal from a ground-based commercial transmitter, but
these only work where you can receive the additional signal.

&gt; My feeling is there is no way you can have a 100m error, go in 
&gt; any kind of a 360 circle and not be miles off getting back to 
&gt; camp . .

The 100m error is from absolute position.  The unit will guide you to
within 100 meters of any given position, after that you are on your own!

&gt; I have heard  . . and actually read somewhere a fix for this
&gt; error . . like you change the value of a couple resistors . .

Nope, the only fix for this error is in Congress.  They're the only
ones who can tell the DOD what to do!
