Hi All

 

HELP!

 

My web hosting service for my business just made me shut down my web
pages. said we had a 10MB limit and we were way over that.  Gee, I've
had over 10MB in my web site for a long time now.

 

Anyway, Anyone know of some good free/cheap web hosting?  I guess I'll
have to find my own url at the same time.

 

Damn.

 

 

 

David
