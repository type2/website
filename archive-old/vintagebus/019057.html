Um, I don't think barndoors have steering dampners; mine doesn't.

When was the last time you adjusted the link pins?  Greased the front end?
How tight are your tie rods and drag link?

&gt; Hey everyone. The Monroe shocks worked out great but save your old
&gt; shocks cause finding bushings is a bitch.
&gt; 
&gt; Anyway can someone tell me if Barndoor steering dampners are the same as
&gt; later models. My front end and steering wheel shakes violently when
&gt; hitting certain types of bumps.
