List:

Thought I'd ask for a general consensus on restoring hardboard sunvisors.  As most I've seen, and that's probably the same for everyone else, they're usually in pretty good shape with some minor surface rust on the metal bar at the top, with some of the paint flaking off the hardboard.  If you're lucky there aren't any gouges or deep scrapes/scratches in the hardboard.

So, what do you do regarding the paint on the hardboard?  It's almost impossible to feather it where there is paint missing due to the pattern grain in the hardboard.  Leaving it alone and just respraying it won't look that great either.  So, the optimal solution would be to strip the old paint off, then respray, but how?

Options:

1.  Use a chemical stripper very carefully one small area at a time, leaving it on only long enougth to bubble the paint, then get the crap off of there asap before it screws up the hardboard.

2.   Heat gun.

I'm thinking a heat gun might be the way to go, or would it just bake the paint on even harder due to keeping the heat low enougth to not burn the hardboard?

Any opinions other than, &quot;Robert, you're wasting your time and ours?&quot;
