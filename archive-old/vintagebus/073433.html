Subject: RE: [VB] Trailer Mounts

Get a chase vehicle to watch and maybe videotape the trailer when it oscillates. 
Wheel balanced? Bus's rear wheels true &amp; balanced? Seems like a little shake in 
the booty would be amplfied by the trailer.

&gt;   My wheel does sit a little cocked . I had to adjust it also by moving the
&gt; angle brackets a little. I do have it nose heavy . Mine only shakes at 75 to
&gt; 80 mph. I had to slow my cruising speed down to 72 to keep it from shaking.
