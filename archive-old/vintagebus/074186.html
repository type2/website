Subject: Spedo broke ?

Guess what? Got the old cable out and finally fished the new cable through
that little grommet. Then I found out that the square hole in the grease cap
was rounded so I had to braze it smaller and then file to fit. After all that,
the new cable from Bus Boys doesn't come with an E clip so it just sat there
in the hole. Didn't matter anyway. After I started down the road the spedo
wasn't turning anyway, broken spedo. Oh well. Wanted to find out what my
average speed was to Everett everyday from Kent east hill. Oh well, I keep up
with traffic.

Ray lookin for a spedo
