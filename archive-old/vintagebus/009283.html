Just got a call from Steve Dolan.  He just made it over the first couple big
hills out of  Albuquerque in the heat of the day.  Oil temp was great.  He
thought the pressure wasn't great, but ok.  Brakes need some more
adjustment, but he is on his way WEST.  Had a quick lunch with him and he
got to meet Ed from the Bus Barn by chance where we were eating, now his bus
is good, what more could he want?
