This is a standard color and any automotive paint store will have the code
for it, just ask for school bus yellow, not Catapillar yellow, or any of the
other yellows, but just school bus yellow. They should even have it in an
industrial paint,

I just called my local paint store and they have formulas for 4 different
school bus yellows, you just need to go pick the one you want, they have
color boards of them all
