Subject: RE: [VB] : [T2] first drive single port dog house

  I agree with Clara, looked at a few of my rods and I do have a few
different styles, lenths and bends.
  I also compared a few of my single port manifolds and they also very in
width, mostly by a mm or so, but I do have one that is a 1/4 inch narrower
then all the others

yes, I have a small collection of thermostat vertical rods.   There are 
different kinds.  They also don't have part numbers on them.  

I believe that an intake can be bent.   Annoying,
