&lt;&lt; I downshifted into 2nd gear at
 about 25mph and at the apex of the turn gave it a little gas. ALL HELL BROKE 
LOOSE, the truck spun despite my turning into the skid, backing out of the 
throttle, and braking. What was the cause? I found gasoline on the left rear 
wheel well! I had put the gas cap on but only got it on one side of the 
locking tabs, allowing fuel to literally pour out on left hand turns and 
right onto my rear tire!  &gt;&gt;
Hi Brit,
Do not feel bad!  This is important info!  We have heard of a Dodge Viper 
that was totalled out with only about 20 miles on it due to hitting a patch 
of wet leaves on one side when the driver punched the gas.  Resulting in a 
spin out and flipping of the car.  Using the engine as a brake in slippery 
weather conditions or paved road surfaces with sand on them can do the same 
result if one is not very carefull due to this only using the rear tires to 
slow down the VW.  Especially on ice one has to engage while moving which 
ever gear is proper for that speed very carefully and get the engine going at 
the same tranny RPM while letting out the clutch.  Then when one notices the 
front end of the VW starting to wander sideways one slightly and very 
carefully lets up on the gas to get the VW to straighten out.  Too much 
letting up on the gas to will result in the same effect as you experienced!
