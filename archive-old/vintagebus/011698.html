Subject: '61 Crew Cab Update
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

Here's a bit more information on the '61 Crew Cab I mantioned earlier.

I went this past weekend and looked at it - it is definitely restoreable. There is quite a bit of surface rust on the body, but little or no rust-through. The nose is very straight, as is most of the body. There is no major body damage. All of the glass is intact. The bed is in good shape and the drop gates are included. The interior is in good shape - decent upholstery front and back and very little rust on the floor. It is available with or without engine - the motor is out now. I'm not sure what model engine would be included. 

It is located in Wimberley, Texas, southwest of Austin. I think he wants around $1500 dollars with engine, slightly less without.

Pmail me if you are interested and I will put you in touch with the seller.
