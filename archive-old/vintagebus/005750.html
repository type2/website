Subject: Re: [VB] speedo bezel removal
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;


&gt; Hi All,
&gt; Does anyone know how to remove the chrome speedo bezel and glass? Also is
&gt; there some trick to pulling the steering wheel?

Use a butterknife and work around and around flaring the crimp out of it. It
should pop loose somewhere around the second pass. Be real slow pulling the
glass off because that seal is dry as a popcorn f_at_rt and might crumble,
which will leave the reassembly not so nifty as well as promote fogging in
the future. Don't reassemble while it is raining either, or you will have a
fogmaster in your dash.

Best way to remove a steering wheel is to take the plasma cutter and cut a
hole in the roof. Hook the come-a-long to the wheel and winch the bus up in
the air from the branch of a tree, then start jumping up and down on the
front bumper. If you don't have a plasma cutter, you could try a steering
wheel puller. Short of that, pop the horn button off, remove the wire and
button and loosen the nut. Might want to disconnect the wire from the horn
so it don't honk at you. I didn't say remove the nut, just loosen it to
where there is a space. Get some blocks under your feet and get yourself in
the seat so that your knees press up against the bars on the wheel. Press up
as hard as you can with your knees and thump down on the shaft with a dead
blow mallet, or a BFH  and a block of wood or something, so that you don't
screw up the threads or cut the horn wire. Most times this will pop it loose
after a couple of beers worth of pounding. If it doesn't, see the first
procedure.
