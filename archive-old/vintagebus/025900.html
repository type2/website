I'd be up for helping to &quot;publish&quot; it.  I'm pretty good with html and have
recently changed job focus, which should allow more time to do the things I
enjoy.  I could also help out with converting to a pdf-format ready for
download and printing to read offline if the user wnated to.  I can ask my
partner if we could host the site as well if that's an issue.
