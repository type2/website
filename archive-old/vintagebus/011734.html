&lt;Autotune6_at_aol_dot_com&gt; (Jeff) asks:

&gt;&gt;I have a question concerning the replacement of my 1500 engine with a rebuilt
&gt;&gt;1600, possibly a turn key.  (single port or duel port) Most of my components,
&gt;&gt;carb etc.. seem to be at the end of the road.

Actually, you have several questions! -;)

&gt;&gt;1.) 	Pros/Cons of a S.P. / D.P.?

If you stick with a single port, you'll have a few less things to change, 
assuming you get a &quot;short block&quot; rather than a complete engine assembly.  For
example, you won't have to get a different intake manifold or carburetor.  In 
most cases carburetors can be successfully overhauled.

Dual ports have better air flow to the combustion chambers, and hence a little 
more power.  But you won't notice it much in a bus, as you're going to be 
limited by the non-aerodynamic shape of the body, and the reduction gears.  If 
saving money is an important concern, you might wish to consider just staying
with a single port.

My feeling is that it's not really worthwhile to spend a lot of time and money 
building a hot engine for a bus.  Reliable, yes, but souped up, no.  Better to
invest any extra $$ you have in other areas, and if you want to build a fast
VW, stick with type 1 or type 3.

Some people on the list may disagree with this opinion, and in fact, it's a
reversal of what I used to think.  Send me email if you'd like me to expand on 
my reasons, but doing so here would greatly increase the length of an already 
long message, and would also be getting away from the questions you're asking. 

&gt;&gt;2.)	I'd like to find a rebuilt 1500, yet I am looking for this swap to be
&gt;&gt;as $$ painless as possible. I would like the outward appearance of the engine
&gt;&gt;to be as close to stock as possible.

Overall, switching to a dual port would only be a minor alteration of the 
engine's outward appearance, and you couldn't tell at all from the outside of 
the vehicle.  If you change from a 1500 to a 1600 single port there would be no 
noticeable difference at all in the appearance, inside or out.

As for saving $$, caveat emptor.  You may not always get what you pay for with 
a high price, but you surely do with something cheap!

&gt;&gt;3.)	Is the existing offset air filter etc. compatible with a 1600 setup ?

If you stick with a stock carburetor, you can use your existing air filter 
setup for both 1500 and 1600 single ports.  If you change to a dual port, it 
would depend on the carburetor that you use.  On my dual port engine I switched 
to a two barrel Holly-Weber carburetor, so the stock air filter setup was out 
of the question.  BTW, the stock oil bath air cleaner is very effective at 
trapping dust, but don't forget to clean it regularly.

&gt;&gt;What about sticking with the non doghouse oil cooler?  Cooling tin conversion
&gt;&gt;problems?

Late model crankcases, such as those used with dual port engines, have larger 
holes (oil passages) for the oil going to the doghouse cooler.  However, VW
dealers used to sell an inexpensive kit of cooler seals &amp; washers that allow
you to adapt small hole coolers to large hole crankcases and vice-versa.  I
haven't tried to buy one of these seal kits in many years, but if VW doesn't
offer them anymore, someone else surely must.

The doghouse cooler doesn't bolt directly to the case, but to an intermediate 
aluminum mounting stand.  The fan housing is different, and you need a couple 
of additional small pieces of sheet metal.  You might well be able to get these 
parts from a Super Beetle engine in a junkyard.

The doghouse cooler is compatible with your 64 bus, and there is plenty of
clearance for it in the engine compartment.  It will work with both single and
dual port engines. 

Doghouse coolers are bigger, so they are more effective in cooling the oil.  
But their biggest advantage is that they are removed from the flow of air to
the head &amp; cylinders on the left side of the engine. 

A chronic problem with upright engines (as opposed to the &quot;flat&quot; engines used
in type 3 &amp; type 4 VWs) is that #3 cylinder runs a little bit hotter than the
others because the old style oil cooler reduces the flow of cooling air to #3. 
Because of this, by far the biggest percentage of engine problems such as
burned or broken valves, and worn piston rings &amp; cylinders, begin in #3. 

&gt;&gt;4.)	I am somewhat new to this bus stuff, my 1500 is old and tired (told by
&gt;&gt;P.O. she is on her 3rd rebuild), any tips on where to find a good rebuilt
&gt;&gt;engine would be helpful.  Money is somewhat an issue,  but I do need to drive
&gt;&gt;her on a regular basis. Trying to keep that &quot; original&quot; look about her.

Several engine rebuilders regularly advertise in magazines such as Hot VWs and 
VW Trends.  I don't have experience with any of them, but perhaps others on the
list can make a recommendation.

Note that &quot;rebuilt&quot; is only a word.  Some rebuilt engines are so thoroughly 
done that they're virtually as good as brand new.  Others may have only a few 
broken components replaced, with much of the engine returned &quot;as is&quot;.  So it 
really helps if you can get some recommendations from folks who have already 
used engines from a particular rebuilder.

Note also that two different 1500 engines were used in splitties.  If you've
got the earlier type, it would be advisable to swap it for a later one.  The
external appearance is very similar, but there are some important mechanical
differences.

The first 1500, introduced in August, 1963, was rated at 51 hp, and was unique
to busses.  The later one, produced beginning in August, 1965, was rated at 53
hp, and was identical to the 1500 engines in '67 and later beetles. 

I haven't taken a 51 hp apart for many years, so I'm pulling the following off
the top of my head.  I'm sure that others on the list can correct any omissions
or mistakes.

My memory is that the 51 hp case didn't have any letter code in the beginning
of the serial number that's stamped just underneath the generator stand mount.
But one of my reference manuals describes the 51 hp engine as being a 'G'
series, so perhaps I'm wrong about that.  The 53 hp did have the letter 'H' at
the beginning of the serial number.

As I recall, the cylinder heads are different, and I know that the rocker arms 
&amp; shafts are different.  The 51 hp has square cut rocker shaft bosses, whereas 
the 53 hp has a beveled edge on the rocker shaft boss.  The 51 hp had thinner 
pushrods, which tended to flex more, sometimes rubbing on the edges of the 
lifter bores at high rpm.  And the ends of the pushrods are different; the
externally fitted ends of the 51 hp are more prone to working loose than those
of the 53 hp, which are pressed inside of the pushrods. 

The recommended valve adjustment is different, .008&quot; intake and .012&quot; exhaust
for the 51 hp, as opposed to .004&quot; for both on the 53 hp.  (Some people would
argue that .006&quot; is better, but I don't agree with that.  Yet another possible
subject for a separate message!) -;)

The 53 hp 1500 cc came with replaceable bearings for the camshaft, whereas the 
51 hp cam rode directly in the crankcase.  The importance of this is not so 
much the loading on the camshaft itself, but that when wear takes place, new 
cam bearings can help maintain proper oil pressure.

The 51 hp engine came with a shorter intake manifold, and a governor that fit 
between the intake manifold and the carburetor.  The mounting studs on the 
bottom of the carb were much longer than usual to accommodate the governor.

You can get rid of the governor, but then you have to either replace the
manifold or install a spacer, as without it the carb hits the generator and
won't seat on the manifold.  VW made such a spacer at one time, but I doubt
very much that it's available now.  But it's a simple machining job to
fabricate one from a block of aluminum --- any machine shop could do it for 
you.

Beginning in August, 1969, VW came out with a &quot;universal&quot; 1500/1600 crankcase 
that could be used in any type 1, 2 or 3 vehicle.  These cases have an improved 
lubricating system, including larger oil passages, a higher capacity oil pump,
and an improved pressure relief valve setup.

It's easy to recognize a late model case by the 8mm oil pump mounting studs 
(older pumps use 6 mm studs), and the presence of a second oil pressure relief
valve on the left front (flywheel) side of the case.  From the outside this
looks like a _very_ big screw head.  Although this case is post '67, and hence, 
was never original equipment in any splittie, some 53 hp 1500 engines may have
them, if the crankcase was replaced during an engine overhaul.

Since you stress that reliability for a daily driver is very important, you 
might wish to consider adding a full flow oil filter, and either a doghouse or 
an external oil cooler.

Having the principal moving parts of the engine balanced will make it run
smoother, and, all other factors being equal, last longer.  A good automotive
machine shop can do this.  At a minimum, I'd suggest balancing the crankshaft,
flywheel, clutch pressure plate, connecting rods, wrist pins, and pistons.  The
crank, flywheel, and pressure plate should be balanced together, and marked so
that they can be assembled in the same relative position in which they were
balanced.

A good quality extractor exhaust system, such as the old Four Tuned systems,
will increase power and mileage without having any adverse effect on
reliability.  Be sure to get a good one from a reputable company, not just any
that you spot in a catalog.

The most important factors are the shape of the collector (the &quot;box&quot; where the
four pipes converge), and that the length of the path between each exhaust port
and the collector is the same for all cylinders.  (The heater junction boxes
are part of this path, which is why the extractor pipes for #1 and #3 cylinders
are so much shorter than for #2 and #4.)  Get a &quot;quiet&quot; muffler with internal 
steel baffles, as glass packs don't add any performance, but do tend to attract
the attention of the police.

A frequent problem of air cooled VW engines is that the exhaust valves have a 
tendency to break, wreaking all sorts of havoc inside your engine.  When one 
lets go, it's really a crap shoot --- the result could be anything from a minor 
overhaul to scrapping the entire engine --- it's much like having a .45 caliber 
bullet loose in there.

Stock valves are made in two pieces (head and stem) and then welded together. 
But even expensive one piece high performance valves can fail.  30,000 miles
seems to be more or less a &quot;magic number&quot; for exhaust valve failure, and some
mechanics recommend doing a valve job every 30,000 miles as insurance against
this, even if the compression is good and the engine runs well.  Intake valves,
which operate at a significantly lower temperature, are much less at risk.

In any case, whether you use stock or high performance exhaust valves, you
should install new ones *every time* the engine has a valve job or an overhaul.
Not doing so is quite simply penny wise and pound foolish.
