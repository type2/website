Hello Everyone

    Wanting to lower their busses I was looking threw the some picture
archives and was also noticing that some of these guys are putting airbags
in their busses to lower the bus for shows and then back up to get down the
highways. Any thoughts probably allot of them but It was just a thought.

&gt; &gt; Anything you want to know about lowering, without the abusive editorial,
ask
&gt; &gt; John or Steve at Wolfgang.
&gt;
&gt; Just to clear this up I think you mean Joe or Steve. There is no John.
However
&gt; there is a Ryan, and a Mike.
&gt;
&gt; I myself go to the extreme when lowering a Bus, narrowed beam, spindles
AND
&gt; adjusters, properly geared tranny with *no* RGB's, boomerangs, etc. But
for
&gt; someone what wants it simple I would recommend dropped spindles in the
front
&gt; (nice drop, with a smooth ride) and depending on your wallet, either an
IRS
&gt; conversion or a straight axle kit in the rear. From my experience both are
going
&gt; to give you freeway drive ability, but the IRS will give you a much nicer
&gt; driving experience.
&gt;
&gt; Rack and pinion I'd like to see pictures of myself. To avoid the nasty
steering
&gt; box drag in my lowered Buses I relocate the steering box. This takes alot
of
&gt; work, including cutting down the column itself...
&gt;
&gt; As for putting the wheel / tires on in the back of a lowered Bus. I unbolt
the
&gt; axle from the spring plate, mount the wheel, etc. to the drum, then swing
&gt; everything up into position and bolt it up.
&gt;
&gt; To lower your Bus for the day (photo shoot) jack it up, pull the wheels,
set the
&gt; Bus on the ground, and stick the wheels up in the fender wells. Take your
&gt; pictures and reverse the procedure. I've seen alot of these &quot;lowered&quot;
Buses in
&gt; the misc. galleries on the 'net. Amusing to say the least.
