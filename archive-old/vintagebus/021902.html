Zach writ:
&gt;I have a 67 westy that I put an upright converted 912 2.0L engine in.&lt;
&gt;It was a lot of work for a little more power and still having webers to
deal with.&lt;

Looks great!!!  If the 912 E's were not so expensive I would add one to my
collection of heaps :)  Will definitely be a classic.

On your bus 912E engine conversion did you change out the FI camshaft when
installing the Webers?  This may explain HP loss in your bus.  The cams are
specific for carbs or FI.  The FI cams probably do not have the proper ramp
on them to create a vacuum for the carbs to give the heads a good gas
mixture.


Keep Up the Kwel Work!
