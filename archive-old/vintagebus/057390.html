Are you baiting the physics guy?

The thing that makes air go from place to place is pressure.  The only
place that &quot;sucking&quot; exists in in the imagination.

When you drink from a straw, you reduce the pressure in your mouth while
allows atmospheric pressure to push the liquid down in the glass and up
the straw.  It's the pressure that makes the motion, not the lack of
pressure on the other side.

This is why folks like turbochargers and
superchargers for
adding power to engines.  With a normally aspirated engine, you only have
14.7 PSI available to push the air throught the carb and into the
cylinder, as this is the absolute atmospheric pressure, so there is a
functional limit to how much air you can move into the cylinder.  If you
pressurize the intake you can move more air.
