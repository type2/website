Hi Mike,
Bummer!!!
It says that:
&quot;Owning to changes in the regulations in various export countries, Sealed  
Beam headlamps with a modified adjusting mechanism are installed from 3rd  
December 1963, Chassi No. 1 211 643.&quot;
  Image nearby shows the newer 180 degree adjusting screws in the  headlight 
assembly rim.  
  Also these later headlight assemblies use a glass lense with the  &quot;Hella&quot; 
cast into the glass, instead the earlier VW logo.
