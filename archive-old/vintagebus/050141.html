Subject: Re: enough Hoover


&gt;SLOW distance and am not sure what all the fuss was about.  I'm sorry,
&gt;but this struck me as rather arrogant too, so I never will ask HIM for
&gt;advice again either.

Gaw. You were robbed. You didn't get your money's worth at all. If I were
you I would flounce right out of Bob's Free Advice Emporium and take my
business elsewhere.

But: it is petty by a factor of three to impose yourself upon the man, then
complain because his hospitality is not sufficiently saccarine, when he
isn't here to defend himself. Bob Hoover has posting priveleges but he does
not subscribe to this list. Those of you doing the whining and the mewling
ought to CC him so he can reply if he likes.

Bob is a father and I expect he knows how to handle the tantrums of
children (ignore them in a conspicuous manner) but maybe I'll get lucky and
he'll be having another of his Baaaaad Daaaaaaaays.
