Place American Flags in our busses tomorrow!
 
I am headed to Hanging Dog in Murphy, NC so it should get maximum exposure
:)
 
Hopefully I will have the roof rack put back together also for spare tire,
water, and gas storage.
 
 
God Bless,
Adrian Pillow

............. 
Tomorrow is U.S. Pride Day. Everyone wear U.S. colors. Try to be wearing 
as much red white and blue as you can. Send this message to as many 
other people as you know. Let's get the whole country into it. 
At least send it to 10 other people. 
They are asking people to drive with their headlights ON in a show of 
solidarity and in remembrance of those who lost their lives ..... please 
pass the word along. 
thanks to all....
