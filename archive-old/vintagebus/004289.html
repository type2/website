I hope they have a better fit than the split bus corner sections they sell,
they have a swoop for lack of a better word that always seem to be short of
enough metal, i'm about to experiment with a bay window lower corner and
swap sides , remove the bumper bulge and see if i can come up with an
acceptiable corner peice for a splitty, i'll keep the list posted on how
this works. As for the web pages they should be up by  friday morning or
maybe tomorrow nite, depends on how tomorrow goes , oh Thom did you get the
pic of the close out section? and is it rite ? Your parts will be done next
week , first thing on list your lower section oval holes is gonna be test
for new spotwelder ,,grin ,,later
