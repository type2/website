Hey Guys,
       I was browsing through Everett's site, the samba_dot_com., and saw some 
of the pix I had sent him are now available for viewing.  Thanks Everett.  
The second oldest Westy known to exist is one of the barndoors.  Ya'll might 
recall this in the back of one of the magazines.  It was also listed on the 
talk list.  I had sent over 140+ pix to Everett, so you guy's might want to 
check back frequently.  Most all of these buses are from the SE United 
States. Also, don't forget, Buses at the Beach II, April 8th, Jacksonville 
Beach Fl. Drive 'Em!
