  Terry wanted me to gice a few details on the 1966 Westy he is going to
auction off Sun. at BBBIV so here goes;

  1966 Westy hardtop walkthru front seats, 12 volt 1600 motor, 4 new (less
then 100 miles) tires, complete stock interior that needs cleaning up a
little,  minor rocker rust and dings,  it is his daily driver bus and will
make it back to its new home with no problems. Someone will drive it away as
there is no rerserve price and the high bidder gets it. He has the signed
and notorized Az. title. Its not a perfect bus, but what a start it will
make as it is an easy resto .

See you all at BBBIV ,  free event frisbees to all who regester.

John Howard
