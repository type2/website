&gt; Contemplating the relative merits of splittie vs. bay window and I have a
&gt; few questions to ask of the other esteemed list members. This is NOT a
&gt; debate of which is the better bus.
&gt; 
&gt; 1.) The Bay windows do not have spur reduction gears correct? How does this
&gt; translate into real world drivability? Does it mean a higher top end at the
&gt; expense of low-end torque which would adversely affect any (gentle) off-road
&gt; use in addition to less slogging-ability through snow here in Wisconsin.

the additional reduction is built into the ring and pinion.

&gt; 2.) The heat and driver controls are better in the Bay windows correct? But
&gt; they lack the overhead vent. Generally though, the Bay window should be a
&gt; warmer vehicle for cold weather cruising?

Bays have excellent dashboard vents.
Heat is about the same.  Same heater boxes, etc.

&gt; 3.) The driving position in the splitties are more forward with less of a
&gt; dash and a flatter steering wheel therefore more bus-like which appeals to
&gt; me immensely. The Microbus--Volkswagen would do good to go back to that
&gt; original idea.

CAn't do it.  no crush space to meet safety standards.
