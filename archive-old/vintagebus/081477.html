Subject: Santa Cruz Campground

A few years back a group of busses(Clara, Ronnie, John Howard, myself and a
few others) spent the night in a campground in Santa Cruz the night after Red
Barn and before Kelly Park.  I loved the place but have forgotten what it was
called.

I seem to remember it being near the beach with lots of tall pines, showers
and fire pits(that's almost all CA campgrounds I know) and I thought it was a
State park.  I've checked the State park website, but can't seem to locate
it.

Does anybody have any idea or know what name it was called???   I know its a
long shot, but I had to ask.

Thanks!

Steve
