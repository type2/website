Subject: Engine rebuild update, Lil Dave's bus (long and technical)

I've been fiddling around with this 1776 now for a few weeks, and today
I took a good solid 8 hours off from work to finish it...

This is the engine I bought for $200, a Fisher Buggies engine with less
than 10k on it. As many of you may recall, I broke a camshaft in it
going to the Farmington show from the Everybus Campout...

The engine had very little wear on it when I tore it down. I had put a
stock sized oil pump in it when I first got it, and apparently something
got between the gears (in the oil pump) and locked it up, causing the
cam to break. Still doesn't quite make sense to me, but that's the best
I can come up with...

This is the first case I've ever built, but I had help whenever I needed
it from my boss Steve Munsey, who has been building VW engines for
years. Plus, I got my parts at just a little over our cost, which really
helped out.

Steve line bored the case to 40 over, the crank was already ground to 10
under and was still in good shape. I installed new crank, rod and cam
bearings. New oil pump (HD 26), Engle 110 cam, Empi heavy duty springs,
new lifters. The old lifters didn't have any &quot;rock&quot; between them. I
don't know if they had been ground flat or if they were just worn.

Finally got it all together today, except for the carb, on an engine
stand with starter setup. Tomorrow I will borrow the pict 34 carb from
my present bus engine and run the engine on the stand for 30 minutes at
1500 rpm, as per the break-in instructions that came with the cam. Then
I will take off all the external stuff, check for oil leaks, change the
oil, paint the tin, and reassemble with the Solex 44/40s I bought for
it. Before I install it, I'm putting in a baywindow tank and repairing
the threads on one of the holes in my right RIB.

The engine I am currently running (from my 74 Beetle) will go into my
son's 67 13 window hardtop deluxe, a father and son project we have been
working on for the last several weeks. On this engine, we will take off
all the external stuff, maybe reseal, pressure wash and paint the tin
before reassembly and installation.

On his bus, we have installed windshields, rear window and rear side
windows with new seals, and rebuilt the front doors and windows with new
seals. Dave pressure washed the bus inside and out, sanded and painted
the window frames before the new seals went in. We had to chisel and
drill out the old rusty popout frames on the remaining 6 windows. We
have jalousie windows for them. His bus had no interior, so we are
installing a z-bed and closet from a bay window bus, cutting the closet
down to window level. He has bumpers, deluxe trim and jail bars for his
bus.

I still have all the Sekurit popout window glass, in case someone needs
it. We need some front seats (restorable frames would be ok, walkthru),
the Volkswagen script for the rear hatch, and the small piece of deluxe
trim that goes between the passenger front door and cargo door.

I guess that's enough for now... more to come...
