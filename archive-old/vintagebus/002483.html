    My Bus, my dog and I went off a road. There was major construction going
on at Sonoma County Fair Grounds where a horse show was being held. One
cone, fallen over to one side, was the only warning. Something I didn't see
at 3am. I was going pretty slow, everyone was pretty impressed the Bus
didn't tip.
     I realized right before I was going over that yes there was no longer a
road under me. I remembered grabbing the stearing wheel and screaming. It
wasn't a long fall maybe a little over 5 feet. My Bus crashed diagonally
because the back wheels were still up on top, but the ground gave away and
then the back end crashed down very hard. The dog got hurt, tons of a stuff
broke ( I have a lot of lights, step ladders, etc for braiding). After it
wholloped into the horizontal position again, the Bus rolled about 30 feet
before it came to a stop. It was really scary. I couldn't get Scuba back
into the Bus or anywhere near it for hours; he was very shaken and so was I.
    Right away I couldn't get the clutch petal to work, so I parked it for
the rest of the show. On the last day I got underneath it. The metal from
the frame was blocking the clutch mechanism. I couldn't pull it out, but
another Braider and I took turns pounding it out from underneath the Bus. I
drove home, but I won't be going anywhere else until I know everything's
safe. I'm afraid there might be more problems. The back slammed down really
hard. The bumper blocks the engine compartment from opening and the muffler
is pressed up against the bumper. It doesn't look good. I'll really get
underneath the Bus tomarrow. I'll look for anything else boken or loose. I
wish I wasn't such a novice car person.
            It could have been a pretty bad situation and I am grateful the
it wasn't.  I think the Bus held up pretty well. I'll probably have a few
questions over the next few days. Gotta get it on the road by Wednesday for
another show.
