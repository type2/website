Subject: Re: [VB] Tires, again

Hello all

Speaking of tires, I just got my Michelin 185R14's from Costco.  Mounted and
balanced $110 ea.(OUCH!)  They had to special order them, but it only took a
couple of days.  When I got the bus it had 197/75/14 Michelins, but very old
and dry.  The new tires look good, well proportioned for the bus.  The
steering seems lighter as well.  I had considered other tires, but  from
reading the archives it seems most everyone thinks this is the correct tire.
Also, as Michelin points out in their ads, we have a lot riding on our
tires, handling, braking, performance, safety etc. so I figure this is not
the place to try and skimp.

Anyway, I am happy, and thought you folks might want to know Costco can get
the tires for you.
