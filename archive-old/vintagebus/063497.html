&gt; Probably a dumb question. But when I pulled the engine

&gt; Time for a new main seal?

Perhaps.  You should remove your flywheel and check to see if the oil is
leaking from the front seal. First smell the oil and see if it's engine or
gear oil. Then...

Buy a flywheel lock - a cheap and very effective tool that makes removing
the flywheel straightforward. It's a small double wedge affair with a bolt
welded to it, which fits between two flywheel teeth and bolts to the case.
Locks the flywheel in place as you are loosening/tightening the nut. Try
to remember to remove it before reinserting your engine - engine goes in
easier that way, as I found out many years ago!

You'll need a 36mm, 1/2&quot; or 3/4&quot; (your choice) drive socket and matching
breaker bar  (socket handle) - Sears will do. Also round up a three foot
steel pipe to slip onto the breaker bar if you need more torque to remove.
If you buy a 3/4&quot; setup, you can use it and the pipe on your rear axle
nuts as well.

Don't over tighten the nut on reinstall. 215 ftlbs. A fully assembled
engine weighs about 250 pounds, and if you tighten the nut so that you are
*just* lifting the engine up on the left side heater box, NO BOUNCING IT,
you are about right, torquewise. Let the engine down smoothly.

You should also check your endplay as well - you can buy a cheap tool that
works with your feeler guage set at the same VW parts store that sold you
the flywheel lock. JC WHitney used to sell both, check their website, or
busdepot or OldVolks. Get the Idiot Manual or the Bentley and learn how.
Endplay is important too.

g'luck,
