Subject: Wierd redux plugs?
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

Hey list,
I have a spare 36mm small nut tranny I was pullin parts off of including a
Redux box half, and I noticed it had 19mm bolt head fill plugs. Not a big
deal but not the typicall 17mm *allen* head bolts I'm used to. so the Q is,
Is this from a different year (splitcase?),  or is it a 63 only 1 ton redux
half ? I know its a 36mm tranny, but i just want to make sure this half will
be ok to use. both sides top and bottom have this plug.

Dont even know if you can fit a 63 redux half on an earlier tranny, but i
wanted to make sure.
