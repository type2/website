Subject: Welding newbie has fun

I've used my MIG welder to tack some things on the chassis but tonight 
I got my first real taste of how nice it is to have one.  The 
clevis-pin hole in the plate that the pedal end of the clutch cable 
hooks to had wallowed out to within a millimeter or so of breaking 
through, which when it does so gives results like a broken cable (my 
old 63 bus did that to me 25 years ago).

Then, I had to scrounge a plate from a junkyard; tonight, inside 30 
minutes I completely welded up the hole, ground it down, and drilled a 
new one.  Painted the plate and you can hardly tell it isn't new.

Far out.  Lock up your metal components.  I'm on the loose.
