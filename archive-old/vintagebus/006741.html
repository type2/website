First of all if your buying from IMC then you must be a shop or dealer,
second IMC sent you this bearing because it was the cheapest when they put
out for purchase, third, I have not found a German manufactuered outer
roller bearing in a couple of years, the ones I get now are from France. I
would return it to IMC and have them replace it, or if you are on a good
repore with your salesman and kiss ssome as# he might beg one of the parts
pullers to check the bin for a different. I try not to purchase parts from
IMC as they DO NOT have country of orgin available to them (salesman) only
the head sales guys have access to this info and they avoid putting it out.
The suppliers that I purchase from will walk out to the warehouse and pull a
part to make sure I get what I am looking for, a good example is the GERMAN
rear axle seals, when I oerdered more I was told all that are available now
are Mexican and I said no, but my salesman went to the warehouse and found
42 more German seals which I purchased all they had.

&gt; I don't know Karl. John has replied trying to help, and your
&gt; response seems a little hostile. Your first post did not
&gt; include the info you gave in the second post. If you give
&gt; halfassed info, you get half useful help.

My original post just concerned the outer bearing and the problem I have
with a Bower bearing. Here is what I wrote&quot;

&quot;I had to replace the left outer rear wheel bearing in my 66 with reinforced
reduction boxes. This uses a roller bearing, part number 211 501 283. The
original one was a FAG, number N207E, made in Germany. I ordered one from
IMC. It came as a Bower, made in USA, with a bearing number of MU1207-CX. It
is CRAP! Even with the center nut torque at 250 ft-lbs. the drum rocks
almost a 1/4 of an inch!!!
I am removing a used one from my bad transaxle to use in this transaxle I am
putting in. It has the brand name of DWB. That is a new one on me....never
heard of it. But it also is a N207E bearing.&quot;

I got a little 'hostile' because I was trying to let people know that a
Bower 211 501 283 is a piece of crap but John seemed to think I didn't know
what I was talking about. It sucks when you are outside working in 100
degree heat, pulling an engine, pulling a transaxle, putting in another
transaxle, and then find a brand new $40 bearing that is a POS.


&gt; If you feel the bearing is bad from the get-go, take it back
&gt; to where you got it.

&gt; &gt; &gt;It probably isn't the new bearing that's at fault. If you needed to
&gt; &gt; &gt; replace one bearing, then the rest of them are probably worn out too.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I am not replacing the bearing because it is 'worn out'. I am replacing
it
&gt; &gt; because the cage that keeps the rollers evenly spaced is/was plastic and
it
&gt; &gt; ceased to exist. Very cheap design.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; The play you feel is probably in the lower inner bearing.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; When I can move the stub axle up and down and the rollers move an eight
of
&gt; &gt; an inch inside the outer race, the bearing is CRAP.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; I recommend
&gt; &gt; &gt; that you take the whole RGB apart and replace all the bearings. It's
&gt; &gt; &gt; really kind of pointless to replace just one bearing in a RGB. Any
chips
&gt; &gt; &gt; that are in the oil from the other worn out bearings will quickly ruin
&gt; &gt; &gt; your new bearing.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I don't have any chips because I don't have metal failure from the old
&gt; &gt; bearing. Even though the plastic cage was gone, the old bearing had NO
play.
&gt; &gt; I found the bad cage only because I had to swap the backing plates.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; I've used Bower brand bearings before and didn't find them to be any
&gt; &gt; &gt; different from any other brand. Different companies will have
different
&gt; &gt; &gt; part numbering systems. Some companies will just use the same system
as
&gt; &gt; &gt; one of the big guys like FAG or SKF. The difference in part numbers
&gt; &gt; &gt; probably doesn't mean anything. They both have 207 in them, so they're
&gt; &gt; &gt; probably the same size.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; When you take the Bower bearing back out, compare it to the used
bearing
&gt; &gt; &gt; you're putting back in. If it has the same ID, OD, and width, then you
&gt; &gt; &gt; can be sure you need to completely rebuild the RGB.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; The problem is NOT in the ID, OD, or width. The problem is in the
clearance
&gt; &gt; between the rollers and the outer race.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Let me make this clear:
&gt; &gt; The outer race is very tight in the housing.
&gt; &gt; The inner race is very tight on the stub axle.
&gt; &gt; The rollers are permanently attached around the inner race.
&gt; &gt; When you put the inner race/roller assembly inside the outer race, you
CAN
&gt; &gt; move it back and forth almost an eight of an inch. This is with the
bearing
&gt; &gt; laying on a flat surface and you are moving the inner race back and
forth.
&gt; &gt; With the brake drum on, you can rock the drum a 1/4 of an inch at the
edge!
