I have been useing NANKING (made in Taiwan) 195/14 8 plys on my 60 DD, I
have over 34000 miles on them and still have at least half my tread left,
looks like at least another 10,000 miles before replacemant and will use
these again.

ps: i run 60 lbs tire pressure all the way around and rotate every time I
check the brakes (once) and remember the heat out here, very hard on tires.

That's mighty short service life.

I understand that you're somewhat bound by the warranty situation, but if
that's typical wear for the Yokos I think I'd be shopping hard for a
different tire.

On a related [sort of] matter...  As I passed a local tire store today I saw
an early bay-window in the shop with the rear end held up by a jack under
the crankcase.  I expect the owner will be installing new motor mounts soon.

&gt;&gt;  ...bought Yokohama 370 M&amp;S (LT195/75 R14 load range D). After 26 K miles
I have had the first failure. The right rear has a tread separation (felt
like a out of balance tire at ~60) and also a warn nail on the other side.
The rest of the tires are Ok but showing wear, I expect another 10 K max
before replacement. The local dealer has ordered a replacement tire under
warrantee (don't know my cost yet) so I will have 2 new tires (spare was
new) on the rear.

Pressure has been kept at 50r/42f, tires balanced when bought, never
rotated.  &lt;&lt;
