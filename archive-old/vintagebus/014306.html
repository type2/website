Hello All,
  I have posted twice about needs for my 67 Westy, and have received many 
helpful replies.  You all are the greatest.  With that said, I need 
something else.  Does anyone know of a source for the original butterscotch 
plaid curtain material.  I have researched the archives and it seems that a 
lot of people have the same need.  I was hoping someone might have came 
across some by now.  If anyone has good pictures of the material or a lone 
curtain they could part with for a price, I would be interested in that as 
well. The idea is to search fabric sources on my own if I only knew what I 
was really looking for.  My current curtains show a lovely cowboy and indian 
desert scene. I don't think they are original.  Thanks in advance for all 
the help.

P.S.  Cheer up, let's hear a few posts about all the great things on this 
list and put the dirty laundry back in the hamper.
