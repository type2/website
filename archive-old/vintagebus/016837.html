Subject: 185r14 new sears tires? Any one have experience with them
Mime-Version: 1.0
X-MIME-Autoconverted: from quoted-printable to 8bit by lenti.type2_dot_com id HAA67494

I read recently in a vw rag that sears has a &quot;roadhandler voyager lx in
185/14&quot; configuration. they supposedly warranty that you will get 100,00 miles
(yes you read that right) out of these tires.

anyonw have any experience with these?? fwiw these tires also come with a thin
white wall.

i would be interested to hear any input on this..
