Happy Friday all,

One night in high school a friend and I were cruising down a 2 lane highway. 
  Up ahead was and object that appeared to be an animal.  Scanning in 
preparation there was dense head on traffic on the opposing lane approaching 
and intense telephone poles on my right that the Datsun 310GX could not 
slalom!  Got closer to see it was a medium sized snauzer (sux he was german 
and a dog) sitting down blinded by my lights in freeze mode.  All I could do 
is flash my lights and role on.  Front apron hit the collar and I saw 2 
pieces in the rear view!  It was a bummer but nothing I could do!  Luckily 
that's the only animal I've crossed in a vehicle.

Blood on the Highway is No Fun
