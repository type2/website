Hi Bill,

I don't believe that those bolts are common or garden M12's. The ordinary M
bolts have a coarser thread than the bolts in the redux boxes of my '60
Dcab. When I took a sample to the local industrial supply place to get a new
set the counter fellow sold me what he described as bolts with a 'metric
fine' thread. They also had a 19 bolt head rather than the 17 of the
originals. Be sure that you get the right ones cos the standard M bolts will
screw up the holes in the redux boxes if they are forced. Also I'd suggest
that you clean up the threads in the holes and use a thread locking compound
before torquing them up. My redux boxes just wouldn't stay put till I used a
horrendously expensive 'metric fine' tap to clean the threads up(wish I had
read NQ's post about his homemade thread cleaner before I shelled out).   

If I got any of this wrong flame my ass!

Later

Michael
