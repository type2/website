Subject: Parts to make roadworthy
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

Well, I finally have my bus sitting in the driveway, and it runs. The 
problemn is that it still needs a few parts to make it raodworthy. All of the 
electrical is there, but for some reason everything is cut where the 
connectors are. In the headlight buckets, there are wires, but only one side 
has the plastic connector. The other side only has the 3 exposed wired. For 
the brakelight, same thing, the wire is there by the master, but not the 
connector. What I am asking is, would it be OK to get these parts from a VW 
pick-a-part, and connect the with the little tube and electrical pliers or 
will this cause shorts? I basically don't have the money for a whole new 
Harness. 

Also there are a few parts I need. Does anyone know where to find a '58 only 
decklid? Any help would be greatly appreciated, or would it be a lot easier 
to just get an early decklid (pre '63)? CAn anybody suggest a place to get 
the weatherstrippng and all that for the front doors, becauseI have all the 
glass, but no rubber or felt. I want at least 1 inside door handle so I can 
get in and out. I also need 2 popout windows because they are just missing. 
If anybody can help, I would love to hear from you!!! :-)

And on a side note, is the rear apron on a '58 supposed to have the cutout 
for a tailpipe on the left side. I ask because BFY told me that when I bought 
their muffler, it was the only 36 hp type 2 muffler there is and the pipe 
comes out the right side. Which reminds me, does anyone know where to find 
the grey tailpipe for a 36 hp. BFY hasn't had one in a while.     THANKS 
AGAIN IN ADVANCE!!!
