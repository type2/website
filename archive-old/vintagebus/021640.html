Would an early Bay have the same rear bumper as my 63? When I was looking at 
it, it seemed to be the same but the two are 50miles away so I couldn't do a 
side by side comparo. Also would the shifter from the 69 work in the 63? This 
guy is parting out a very clean 69 (hit hard in front) and I'm trying to pick 
off as much as I can use.

Thanks,
Brian
