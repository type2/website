&gt; We are going to make curtains for our Westy...we have the track from the
&gt; front sliding curtains, but all the little sliding plastic pieces are
&gt; broken.  Can someone please tell us what these are called and where to get
&gt; enough of them to make curtains with?
&gt;
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; Gene
