Subject: [VB] BUS SHEET METAL


&gt;    What do people think are the most desirable sheet metal pieces
needed for
&gt; a bus. I am trying to get a list in priority of what is needed.
There is a U
&gt; S manufacturer who I have been in contact with for a few years now,
that is
&gt; ready to step up to the plate and start stamping bus metal. There
goal is to
&gt; have 3 or 4 parts made by the Classic weekend to show (display).
They have a
&gt; very fast production time due to new state of the art laser tracers
and die
&gt; cutters and can have parts made in about a weeks time. I am sending
them R/L
&gt; rockers and associated pieces and am also sending them a dog leg
(early).
&gt; They already have a NOS front floor but I did not ask which year. In
a
&gt; discussion I had with them they were talking of doing cargo floors
also. Due
&gt; to a major recession in the auto industry back East they now have
the time
&gt; to make other parts, basically anything to avoid shutting the plant
down and
&gt; putting people out of jobs.
&gt;
&gt;  Ronnie    mo metal
&gt; ps. please respond to the list or P-mail, if you have any NOS (body)
parts
&gt; to copy LMK
&gt;
&gt;
