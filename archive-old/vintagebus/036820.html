I've never seen pinstriping on a deluxe, it would look kinda lame with that 
trim and all.

&lt;&lt; Anyone see that '53 Barndoor Kombi in Hot VWs this month?  It said in the

article that that white pinstiping was factory-correct.  Is this true? 

I've never noticed a pinstriping line on the original paint Kombis I've

seen.  On Standards and Deluxes, yes.


My wife thought the stripe looked &quot;lame&quot;.  :)
