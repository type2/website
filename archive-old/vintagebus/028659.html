so my wife ran into a guy she used to work last week and he said i have an
old tent that my dad got with his 71 camper when it was new.   50.00 bucks
later  its mine.    looks alot like the one that was on e-rape,   but it
looks like it has a floor--- same colors.   i have not set it up yet  but
ben (the guy i got it from)   said it was a drive-away.   from what i can
tell there is a rubber strip as long as the cargo door, with a C channel
like it would clip to the gutter.   maybe i will have to sell my sundial
tent and keep the drive-away.    john
