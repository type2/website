&gt; I went to the gas station to fill up the bus after driving it around town
&gt; for the past 2 weeks to work (a 5 mile comute).   It took 8 gallons to go
&gt; just under 200 miles; that would be around 25MPG.  Is that good, bad or
&gt; sorta OK.  I have a 1500cc single port engine that I just rebuilt (the
first
&gt; tank of gas to go thru the new engine) with a new carb.  This is a stock
'67
&gt; with no whistles and bells.
&gt;


That is good. I have found 20 -21 mpg to be pretty much standard, regardless
of model. My '58 submarine hatch westy got 20 mpg (no gauge, I could count
on 200 miles from a full tank) with a stock 40 hp. My '65 camper got 20 mpg
with a dual carbed 1600. Rosie gets 21 with a dual carbed 2110.
YMMV
