I've used dupont velvaseal before and it works great...what you do 
is go to your local automotive paint supply and have them tint 
some sealer whatever color you wish! its not really paint or primer
but a sealer ..it comes clear and can be made any color you want 
and its one part!just spray it on!....its the same stuff the old 
hotrodders use. it kind of dries semi-gloss and its made to be 
painted over can last lots of years too.its even washable
