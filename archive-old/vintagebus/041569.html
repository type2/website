&gt; They have high quality Pennzoil GL4 lube. 75-80 weight.

Is this the correct viscosity?  Seems a bit light to me, but I don't have
my book available.

Sta-lube makes GL4 lube, and I haven't had any problem finding it at my
FLAPS.  You can also get Redline MT-90 synthetic, which is designed
specifically to the GL4 spec.
