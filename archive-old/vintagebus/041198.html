Hola, listees... Quick questions: Does anyone have pics of the delux
rear/middle seats for &lt;'67? (I have a '67, but am not so concerned about
having &quot;to have&quot; a '67 ONLY rear and middle). Have a friend, out of state,
who has found another VW &quot;stash&quot; for me, and I wanted to send him some pics
(any pics of middle/rear seats, not just deluxe), so he knows what to grab.
Any/all angles, frames, whatever... &quot;Anyone?... Anyone?&quot; (in my best Ferris
Bueller's Day Off voice)... Gracias. Jon
PS. After he lets me know what's available (minus my own needs, of course),
I'll get back to you folks to try and fill needs. Thanks, again.
