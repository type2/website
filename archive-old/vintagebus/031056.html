Subject: door handles needed

Hey:

I'm looking for some advice on replacing the door latches on my bus.  I
have a 60 dbl door and would like to have all the doors keyed the same.
Can I buy new custom made or is it better to buy used if they are
available.......are they available????  I guess I'd need the two main
doors, 2 double doors, engine lid and back door.  Any advice is
appreciated....I'm close to getting the bus inspected and on the road.
Thanks.

Kevin
