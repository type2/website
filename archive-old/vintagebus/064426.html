Subject: [VB] Front Suspension softening.

&gt; I have been wanting a softer ride in my bus and thought that removing one
of
&gt; the leaves from either the upper or lower torsion bar might assist in this
&gt; endeaver. Additoinally I would want to add one of those screw type gadgets
&gt; for lowering/raising the front end to allow me to reset the height back to
&gt; normal. Anyone have thoughts on this or tried something like it?
&gt;
&gt; Dave W. I read your post.

Don't confuse spring rate with shock damping characteristics.
You may first want to consider different shocks.
Thanx for reading the other post. ( Read it again :).
