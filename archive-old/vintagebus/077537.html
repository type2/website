Subject: Re: [VB] battery explosion cleanup

i had my battery catch on fire a few years ago in the dormobile. i came home and 
covered the compartment with a baking soda paste and let it sit for days. then 
cleaned it and did it again adn left some there after cleaning it out again. i got a 
little corrosion but it seemed to halt and i haven't had to do it again in over a year.
was not happy and there is a paint bubble on the corner of my bus now too that baking 
soda won't fix!!

&gt; As you may remember, I posted an earlier message about

&gt; battery.  Now I am facing the problem of cleaning up
&gt; the mess.  Right after it exploded I squirted the area
&gt; with water and mild soap
