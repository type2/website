Yah, they just relabeled a can of paint remover and then put some mineral
spirits in a can, threw in a couple of scrapers and charge you 59.95. All
Porches 356 came under coated from the factory and all we did was use
aviation paint stripper to remove the undercoating, then used lacquer
thinner or mineral spirits to do the final clean up, material cost, about 10
bucks, scrapers 1 dollar Pep-Boys throw always, the biggest expense was the
respirators.
