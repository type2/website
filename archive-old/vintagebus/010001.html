Hi all!
I'm looking for a 1960 to 1971 Westie for my family and I to see a bit of
the country in.  We're currently living in Lacey, WA, but want to do some
traveling VW style!  I am an avid Vintage VW fan, and have owned a 1966.
Selling that car was a dire mistake, and one I don't plan to make again!  If
you all can help, please let me know.  I know my way around Volkswagens
fairly well, and still have my idiot manual, which saved me countless times!
  We plan on moving later this year, and want to do it in a Westie!  I am
currently saddled with two cars, a 99 Saturn 3 door and a 2000 Hyundai
Accent, both great cars, but we need one with more room!  We owe roughly
$11,000 on each of them, and would trade either of them for a good bus, if
you know someone who would want to assume payments on them.
Thanks for your help, and remember to wipe your windshield inside each night
before you put your bus to bed, because it sure helps when you don't have to
defrost each morning!
Yours in happy motoring,
Barry M. Rowland
