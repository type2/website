 I've diagnosed my tipper electrical problems to a faulty generator. So, I
 opened up the shop manual (the red and gray one since I have yet to locate
 an original VW workshop manual that covers the 67) and the first line I read
 is &quot;Remove Engine&quot;.
 
 Is this true?  Last night, I started in on this project and quickly realized
 after I had removed the carb, taken the bolts/nuts off of the intake
 manifold, generator pedestal, etc that I still couldn't remove the
 generator.  Maybe Muir is right in saying &quot;watch how it gets more difficult
 as the years go by&quot;.
 
 Thoughts?  Is this the straw that forces me to just pull the motor and
 replace it with a correct 1500 h-case AR motor?

if you can undo the 36mm fan nut on the front side of the gen, you can remove 
the carb and pull the gen back with motor in place, even  if it a dog house, 
without loosening the fan shroud.  w/o loosening gen pedestal.  There is a 
wierd wiggle getting the front gen tin out from around the bit there.  Did 
this in my 65 recently- popped what $160 for new gen and reg, and it was real 
quick to remove/ install.   But If it was a new bus to me I'd pull the motor, 
and check it all out while I was at it.
  I mean, it is not that big a deal to pull the motor.
