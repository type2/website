1964 Volkswagen Dormobile

This is the best set-up for going on road trips with friends, or camping 
with your family. It sleeps up to four adults, and also has a cot that 
goes over the front seats. With the top up there is 8 1/2 feet of head 
room, so you can stand right up even if you are really tall. This bus 
has been properly converted to a walk-thru which is also a really handy 
feature to have. The bus is fitted with a late model Westy interior, and 
a homemade (?) icebox &amp; cupboard. It also has a propane RV furnace with 
a thermostat, so you can camp comfortably all year round. The curtains, 
top bunks, and front cot have all been nicely redone. Very solid bus 
(rust only on front floor - have repair panel for driver's side). 
Passenger side rear 1/4 panel has been replaced (from a panel - no side 
rear window where the closet is). 1600 dual port engine core that needs 
to be rebuilt. We'll include an extra set of used 1600 pistons &amp; 
cylinders (one has a broken ring), and a new 34 pict carb &amp; manifold 
set. Bus is painted with flat black rust paint. Cool homemade wood slat 
roof racks (front &amp; back). Has a bit of play in the king pins, and 
centre pin on the beam. Good tranny. Brakes seemed OK when it was last 
driven. Lots of groovy window stickers, no rear bumper. One small rip 
(approx. 2&quot;) in the original striped top. Wiring is of course old and 
could stand to be redone. We'll include a new &quot;wiring works&quot; main 
harness. Also needs front seats
Best regards,
Chris &amp; Gina
