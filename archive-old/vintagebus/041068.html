Ok List
I recently found someone in Germany that has one NOS trailer hitch setup for
sale. As you can imagine it is big $$$, I have a nice daily driver that does
have some NOS parts on it, but I don't particularly want this piece to be
one of them. Is there anyone out there that has a used one, or repo one they
want to sell?
