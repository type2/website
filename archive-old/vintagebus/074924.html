&gt; Worse yet, I got that once at a gas station in York PA from a guy who
&gt; said he was a mechanic at the local VW DEALERSHIP!
&gt; 
&gt; I then explained to him how VW was STILL making doublecabs, even out of
&gt; Eurovans.

Today I actually saw a Kombi turned into a double cab hack job.  The one
day I didn't have my camera with me:-(  East bound on the 134 in Eagle
Rock CA at 3 PM.  It was a fairly good job from 2 car lengths away..up
close it was rough!  Cut above the belt line with the back top half
grafted on to make the cab back.  One window each behind the driver/pass
but no side door.  It was in beige and green primer.
