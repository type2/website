&gt;  The overall ratio will be somewhere *around* 4:1 to 4.5:1.
&gt;  I think the procedure for figuring this out goes like: shift into
&gt;  4th gear, put the back of the Bus up on jack stands, and release the
&gt;  parking brake.  With the key off, turn the engine with a wrench until
&gt;  the timing mark is lined up - all you need is a point of reference.
&gt;  Mark one of the rear tires at &quot;12 o'clock&quot; with chalk or tape.  Then
&gt;  go back to the engine and start turning it over with the wrench,
&gt;  counting revolutions and checking the mark on the tire periodically.
&gt;  When the tire has made one complete revolution, stop turning the
&gt;  engine - the number of turns you have made tells you the gear ratio.

I think that is how you do it, except I though it was-- singular- jack stand 
so only ONE wheel will turn, and you count the one that does.  Leave one 
wheel on the ground.  anyone have that website URL to figure the ratio?
