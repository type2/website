I have kept track of milage in all my VWs since I first got a splitty as it 
did not have a gas guage.  go to a drug store and get a little 69 cent 
notebook, the small kind you can put in the door pocket or the dash tray.  
when you fill up write down thw amount and themilage.  you can calcualte the 
MPG.  I found this very helpful as I did not know my motor was bad until I 
put gas in and found I had 16 mpg instead of the usual 31mpg.  65 compression 
in #3.   ick.  notebook is also good for jotting down tuneup and other 
incidental repair.  cause there is no way in hell I will remember when I 
changed my gear oil or whatever.  you guys dont think I remeber stuff.  
nooope.
