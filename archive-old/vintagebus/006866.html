just got off the phone with John Flowers and we were discussing the tragic
rest stop happening, so anyway he signed up on AIRS to see if he can offer
help when someone is in his area. Then we talked about an AIRS decal for
members to put on there buses, I think that this decal would cause people
who don't know what Airs is to ask, maybe this would help to ward off
another rest stop tragedy and make more people aware of Airs without
publicizing it to much.
