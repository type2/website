Aftermarket &quot;Quiet Pak&quot; exhaust systems eliminate the preheaters and require
longer tubes to reach the connections below the tin.

To prevent damage to the paper/foil tubes where they pass through the tin
I've had good luck using grommets made from split plastic tubing.  They seem
to tolerate the heat well and last for years.

Quick question for the list...
When I was working on my bus a couple months ago I replaced the tubing in
the
engine compartment, black paper/accordion like, i think it went intot he
heater boxes(sorry i forget?)
Anyway i noticed a piece of metal tubing in the middle, where the tubing
passed through the engine tin to outside or below the engine compartment. I,
being the rocket scientist that i am, didn't put those metal pieces back(I
left them in boston). I now realize that those metal sections prevent the
tubing from getting cut from the engine tin. Does anyone have some
dimensions
of that part? I am currently taking a milling class, and thought it might be
a
pretty easy part to make for a beginner.

thanks
