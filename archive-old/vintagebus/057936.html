Subject: toughest climb

Baja man...we took my 60 DC down to el Rosario in Baja. I thought it
would be flat. We had the stock 40 horse and 600lbs. of water as well as
camping windsufing and surfing gear for three. Way overloaded. There
were at least two passes that we were climbing the last 1/2 mile in 1st
gear. It was brutal.
