How about I send you a black wire and a bottle of green paint and a real
small brush!
That way you can deal with yourself!  Like a 12 step program in one!

 Ok,  I almost have the wiring done in the double cab thanks to a few hours
 of free time Sunday morning... but when I was finishing up wiring the
 flasher relay and the terminal block, I realized that the wire I got with
my
 wiring harness that goes to the passenger side front turn signal light is
 too short.  Probably due to the fact that it is expecting a hazard relay
 someplace which I don't have.  Anyway, my first reaction was to call
 WireWerks up and ask for a longer black with green striped wire but then I
 thought I should probably ask the list real quick to see if I could find a
 *vintage* wire.  So, how 'bout it.  Anyone out there have one of these
wires
 left over from a re-wire job?  Richard Barker sent me his old wire harness
 from his Nov. 59 panel some time ago which I've been scavenging bits and
 pieces from but this wire is not there.
 ... I labeled this 'name this post' for all those that are now rolling
their
 eyes and are now confirmed believers that I've finally flipped out due to
 the og wire request....
