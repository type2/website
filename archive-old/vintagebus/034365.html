Subject:  RE: [VB] Smacked roof repair
Date: Tue, 8 Feb 2000 15:47:47 +1100 

The problem is that the vent is built into the structure
at the front of the bus. (doh! good explanation).  I have some
pics of a complete roof off/replacement that I will eventually
write up on my web pages (on a 15 window deluxe)......

Anyway, its easier to remove the roof and leave the vent in
place rather than vice-versa.  For something that could potentially
be straightened out (ie doesn't need new metal let in) I would
do the old drill and pop it out with a slide hammer, or use those nifty
little studs that weld to the panel (no holes) and a slide hammer.

&gt; I'm sort of at a loss for the front
&gt; dent/vent-coming-off-sorta mess though.  If the vent can come off, I would
&gt; think the best repair would be to remove it or pry it down a bit, and fix
&gt; the dent that way.  If it can't, or is difficult to remove/replace, I'm
&gt; not
&gt; sure how to best approach it.  Any suggestions on how to remove the
&gt; overhead
&gt; vent or what to do in general?
