&gt;Which of these is right\wrong.  My bet is that it goes AFTER the fuel pump
BEFORE the carb, but I want to be sure.  And if it is in the wrong place, is
this likely to affect performance at all??
&gt;
my personal opinion:
dont do it!! you'll kill the bus for sure - the bug is on death row already.
if i fealt the need to have one at all, i'd fit it before the pump - as soon
as the filter gets even a little blocked the pump will blow the joints
apart, fuel would squirt all over the hot engine and electrics and before i
even knew it i'd be running down the street shouting fire!!
best bet is not to have one at all unless your tank is dirty
