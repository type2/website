Subject: RE: [VB] FS: T3 oil cooler

You can visually see a large difference in the fins.  The T3 cooler has much 
more cooling surface.

... I wish I had a digital camera to show you all :(

Take Care,
Adrian

&gt;   I don't feel like counting the fins but I would guess 20 to 30% more 
&gt;fins.
&gt;There is a noticable difference in the 2 coolers

&gt;Is there more than one style of T3 cooler?  Early?  Late?  I've heard of
&gt;the &quot;tight finned&quot; T3 cooler...are they all &quot;tight finned&quot; or just some.
&gt;  What constitutes &quot;tight finned&quot;?  How many rows??
&gt;
