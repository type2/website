&gt; Does anyone in Colorado know if JB Heaters is still in business?  I have
&gt; been trying for 2 weeks with no answer.  If I let it ring long enough, the
&gt; message &quot;your call cannot be connected at this time&quot; comes on.  I even
&gt; tried to call information and ask them if the phone number was working.
&gt; Information said that phone number listed in Hot VW's does not have a
&gt; listing.
&gt;
&gt; I have a cold bus and really need some South Wind parts, does any one know
&gt; of another source?

There is a guy named Arkady Mirvis on the Type 3 list that is in the heater
business. I think I remember some discussions about him on this list a while
back. Here is his info:

Ark Mirvis - &quot;The Heaterman&quot;
31 Byram Bay Road
Hopatcong, NJ 07843
Tel: (973) 398-6363
Fax: (973) 398-7298

I have never used him so I can't give you any info on how good his service
is.
