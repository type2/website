Good question! Thankfully I'm not even in the running for being a judge, so
I don't have to make those decisions. :) My 55.5 Westy is a prime example
of a primered bus. The engine compartment is still OG primer, but the
original owner painted it. So, when it goes through the resto process I'm
planning on painting it in those original owner colors, not primer. But, I
might leave the engine compartment as is...
