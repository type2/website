Subject: Re: [VB] On Balance

Attention all D/FW listees. Report to Discount Tire for wheel balancing.
I'm not sure if they all have the adapter but the one near my Fort Worth
house did. That will be all, dismissed.

&gt; Hi Hart,
&gt;   No one around where I live has the adaptor either. They say its 
&gt; not worth 
&gt; the price ( either that or they don't know what I'm talking about). 
&gt; But 
&gt; there are several places that balance the tires while on the 
&gt; vehicle. That 
&gt; doesn't seem to be the best solution but its the best I could find.
&gt; 
&gt; good luck,
