&gt; Do you guys with roof racks park in garages? Seems like it'd be too tall
&gt; for the door. How about carports? I want to &quot;look coool&quot; with my wood slat
&gt; roof rack, but doesn't make sense if I can't pull in the garage at night.

My bus with a rack doesn't fit in my garage.  Even without the rack it
barely fits under the tilt-up door.  If I ever have a house
built, it will have a door that is 3 feet higher than normal.  Actually,
what I need is a giant garage with attached house.
