&lt;&lt; Look for me at Puyallup. Who else is going? &gt;&gt;
Hi Jack,
We will be there and if anyone going wants to upgrade to a type 4 cooler in a
dog house shroud for fresh air 40 HP and later upright engines come see us.
We are modifying by welding the dog house shroud, the diagonal hot air exaust
tin, and the L-bar that bolts to the cooler for $50.00 with exchange of the
same of your good used parts so we can turn around and convert them for the
next volks.  So if interested drop us an Pmail before this meet so we can try
to have enough of these parts ready for you and dig out those spare dog house
parts!       Eric&amp;Barb
