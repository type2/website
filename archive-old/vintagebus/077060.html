&gt; Well ran into a job ending snag and really don't know what to do to solve it.

&gt; I have the doghouse cooler setup on the 71 engine. So I had to use the 71's
&gt; fan housing.  When Iwent to bolt it on the puley for the generator doesn't
&gt; line up.  I found out a while back that I have a bug generator with a bug
&gt; backing plate.

I think that you mean &quot;bus generator&quot; here and will go on that assumption.

&gt; Haven't been able to locate a dished plate to use the correct gen.  I thought
&gt; I might be able to use the backing plate I had on the 71 with the 6V gen but
&gt; the holes don't line up.  :(

Two ideas:

Find someone who has converted their bus generator to an alternator and
use their dished plate and the matching bus fan hub.  Sorry, mine is
already gone!  Be sure that you get the hub, as you won't be able to fit
the fan without it!

Or, buy an alternator stand and install an alternator.  It uses the bug
tin and fan hub that you already have.  Very easy to do if things are
already apart!
