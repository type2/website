Subject: Re: [T2] Bus wanted , Old one dead

76 VW Van, auto, insp/tags, daily driver, good cond.
Call this guy! 972-578-9899 he's in Dallas TX has ad that says $1250.00
or best offer.
Not mine, haven't called him, not going to.
Don't contact me about it but I'll just bet its a good buy since VW vans
aren't popular here.

&gt; Ok,
&gt;  I need to get a bus.
&gt; I am located in Charlotte NC , I will drive a day one way to get one 
&gt; .  Any
&gt; bus any year , It must drive  although a motor is not important as i 
&gt; can
&gt; bring a 1600 i have to put in it(assuming it will fit). I wanted a 
&gt; truck but
&gt; i will settle for a bus,  looking for one in the $2000 area.
&gt;  Thanks
&gt; , Bryan
