&gt;The &quot;middle&quot; position *is* off.   The reserve tap fits the baywindow perfectly.

OK - my local flaps has one - i assume it is for a beetle. i recall that
these things work backwards from what we need? i checked the archives (i'll
do so again), and was there some reason I missed on one NOT being able to
&quot;flip&quot; it around for our needs?
anyone sell a 'proper' bus one?

i am really into the idea of having a simple, plain-sight theft
deterrent... what joyrider is gonna look at something with a knob painted
&quot;HEAT&quot; or something to make it go ??


anyone done this... places to drill, size cable to get, etc??
