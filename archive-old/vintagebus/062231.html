Subject: A junkyard motor



Well yesterday I was at my local junkyard and I came a cross someones old
drag bug, looks like it was in an accident, I pulled off the deck lid and
what sits there is the motor and tranny still there! and they look way to
clean ,there is oil in it and it looks like it was just changed too, the
motor doesn't have the cooling shroud or a alt mount(its blocked off with a
chrome plate). I can turn it over buy hand , the owner of the yard says the
old owner says it runs. My question is what are some thing I should look for
that might cause some problem . ohh yea they said I could have the motor and
tranny for $350, so Im sure I can talk them down to $250:)
thanks Ian
