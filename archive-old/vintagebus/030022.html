Woo hoo Ronnie! Put me down for a set.  Now I can finally finish the resto of
my bullet proof bus!  ;-)  I even cut holes in the doors so I can shoot my
pistol out of it.  Armored truck sort of thing.  Oh yeah...don't forget the
kevlar sunroof....and tail lights that flip open to reveal rifle barrels
pointing out at you if you're following me too close.  This bus gives a whole
new meaning to the term &quot;bullet&quot; turn signals.  I've rigged the guns so that I
have triggers for them on my steering wheel....  the headlights pop open to
reveal rocket launchers.... this bus even makes oil slicks!  (note to self  --
replace push rod tube seals)

I think Dan &quot;the nugget man&quot; would be proud...  8)

Isaiah &quot;wheres my AK-47&quot; Hanback
with no buses that would require pressed bumpers

&gt;  bumper and a set of splash pans. These are going to made out
&gt; of fiberglass, with Kevlar also available on special order.
