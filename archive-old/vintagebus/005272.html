Subject: Diana stopped by...

Diana Krebs stopped by at the lumber yard today with her friend Tara.  Both
were in extremely good spirits.  It's just too bad that I was _just_ getting
ready to leave for a sheetrock load because I wanted to have more time to
visit and have a little lunch with these gals.  Diana's bus is painted
really nice (just like the picture on the web page) and even though the
engine sounded just a tad rough at idle, when she revved it up, it sounded
strong.  That gal does good work on her dub engines.

Anyway, Diana is heading to Davenport, IA for a concert by a band that I now
forgot the name of so she wasn't able to stop for camping this time nor will
she be headed back through this area on the return trip from Weezeeanna.
They are going to take a more southerly route on the return.

I noticed that Diana had a nice roof rack on the front of the bus with a few
goodies in it as well.  That rack sure looked cool - wish I could have got
some pix but time was not with me today.  I almost missed seeing her.

So things are going well for Diana on her trip.  Just thought I'd let
everyone know...
