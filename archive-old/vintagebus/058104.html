Subject: RE: [VB] Early high-roof

&lt;snip from Ronnie&gt;I have seen highroofs with OG windows at the belt line
and have seen 1 with the side windows (OG) up high also.&lt;/snip&gt;

That's what I thought. I just couldn't put my finger on it, but thought
I had seen variations like that as well.

&lt;snip from Ronnie&gt;I think you need to buy the one from BBT Rich&lt;/snip&gt;

Me too. Anybody have a complete Ambulance interior (w/windows) they want
to sell me?? ;)
