Subject: de-lowering the rear &amp; other queries
Date: Thu, 26 Apr 2001 15:55:50 -0700
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

So after letting my bus, (60 standard,) sit in the rainy seattle weather and
taunt me for the last 4 months, I figure it is time to stop lurking and
start working now that there is a bit of sun.  So I have a few newbie-ish
questions for the gurus out there.

First off, the PO had lowered the bus with a busboy albatross beam.  That
was fairly simple to rectify.  But I am having difficulties with the rear.
In crawling in there and looking around, it doesn't appear that anything has
been modified.  It all looks stock and has the typical layer of road crud.
So how might one lower the rear without replacing things.

After reading Pauls post regarding the angle of the spring plate in his 59,
I am thinking that this might be how it was lowered.  Any other ideas on
what I might check to get the rear back to normal height?

Second question is regarding wipers.  I am going to need an entire set up
for the wipers.  Motor, arms, the whole deal.  The bus was changed to a 12
volt set up when the PO put in a new engine.  Should I look for a proper
year 6v and just use a voltage regulator, or will a newer 12v motor and
wiper hardware work?  (Yes, I am clueless as far as the wipers are
concerned.)  Any thoughts or links would be cool.

Finally some silly &quot;what is this for&quot; questions.

Check out these pictures on my web page.  http://magnobeam_dot_com/bus/  Are
these holes for the Trucker Mirrors that have been greatly discussed?  I am
kinda thinking of looking for some, mostly to fill the holes, but am not
sure where to begin.

Also, in looking at aftermarket antennae available through the various
suppliers, I am not seeing one that looks like it would have a mounting
configuration similar to the number of holes on the nose of the bus.
(pictures also on site)  Are they extraneous holes or were they actually
used to mount an antenna.

Anyway, thanks for any help or advice you might have.  See you in Puyallup

Chris
