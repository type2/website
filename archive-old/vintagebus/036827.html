 I own a 1955 Combi with a seatbench in front. I want to rebuild this bench
 to 2 single seats like M058. I searching the web for detailed photos about
 this option. Can ya help me ?
  &gt;&gt;
Hello,  
M058?   do you mean M 080? 

there is a small amount of diffference of opinion  of bench seat vs 
walkthrough people.  some prefer one kind, some the other.  My self, I find 
the bench seat highly preferable, and do not want a walkthrough bus.  the 
spare tire storage behind the seatbench is very useful, and there is extra 
storage there.  I do  not need to walk through.  others may disagree.    

In either case, there was a large movement to create walkthroughs in the 
seventies.  Iin which people would remove the metal partition rather 
untidily, and bolt in bucket seats.   this also removes the M code tag or 
body number from the bus, unfortunately.  Additionally,  the wheel wells get 
out and taillight holes enlarged.  this was cool at the time, and the people 
who have these buses today largely lament that such a movement existed.

I know someone who is making a walkthrough from a bench seat bus,  he took 
the seat framework out of a dead walkthrough and welded it into the bus, so 
it will look close to factory, not a cheesey hack job.  A lot more work.  But 
he really wanted it to be a walkthrough, and no ragged edges please.

There are walkthrough (M 080) buses out there, perhaps you could get one 
instead if you really want a walkthrough that much.

BTW, what is your buses' chassis number?    Is it a barndoor or post bd?
