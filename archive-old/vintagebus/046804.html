Hi Al,
Are the ones you have or looking for the VOA ones?  If so they would have the 
VOA logo stamped on the front of them.  If they do not have this stamp or you 
are not concerned in getting VOA ones, you just need to check out your FLAPS 
and manufactures of aftermarket mirrors.   Eric&amp;Barb
