 &gt;Drove my bus to work today for the first time since I tore it down to
 &gt;re-paint. Time for the Big Shakedown to work out the bugs before our trek to
 &gt;OCTO/Classic. ( about 1860 miles one way ) Anybody else driving from the
 &gt;midwest this year? Wave if you see me by the side of the road!

Wish I was going to the Classic this year...and if I was, I'm glad I don't
have that far to go. ;) But all the best on the long trip out....it's
worth it!

 &gt;Anyway, I put the original trans back in after having it rebuilt and adding
 &gt;a 4.12 R&amp;P. The RGB's I rebuilt a couple of years ago. Problem is it has a
 &gt;nice howl that peaks at 45 mph and dies away around 60.

I had this same problem up until yesterday. I had what I always described
as a slow washing machine out of balance sound right at 45mph and it turned
out that my driver's side RGB bearings were totally thrashed. Not just
one, but all four. So I had them replaced and it's amazing how much
quieter my Bus is...I can hear all the other stuff that's wrong. ;)
But that's just my two cents on what could be wrong with your tranny. I'm
sure there's other stuff that could be out of whack.
