Subject: The Bus Depot's &quot;economy brake parts&quot; anyone tried 'em

Was looking for brake parts &quot;on the cheap&quot; for the
beater `66 s-c and saw bus depot has economy wheel
cylinders for like $6.95...wow that is cheap...my
question is has anybody used these with decent
results...? 

Also anyone know what brand these are?  It says
India-China.  I have used the India brand BI TVS years
ago and they were great....just wondering if it is the
same stuff. I emailed the depot but have not heard
back yet.

thanks
