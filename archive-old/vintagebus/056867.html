Subject: Trip report---BYOB and beyond (longish)

We're finally back home after a good weekend of travelin'

Here's the boring details if anyone is interested...
Headed out Fri. am to caravan up with the San Diego SV2 bruthas to BYOB.
BYOB was great....nice show and good to put faces with listees.  Always good to see the same ol faces too =)

Kudos to Roger Nang and other SV2'ers for a great get together after the show. 

Decided to skip out on KP so we headed out to the coast to camp with some other listees--kudos to Ricky Fu for the great late dinner.

Woke up and began the trek to Reno to visit another listee in Reno.  Had a great stay and I have to give many thanks to Chuck Notmeyer for the hospitality and help/advice/shop while working on the 63EZ.

After a few days in Reno we then headed back down towards home with a stay in Mammoth...played in the snow and cruised on back home.

All in all a great weekend for us....bus is running like a top &lt;thanks Chuck&gt;, and now it's time to settle back into the daily grind.

1800 miles over the past 6 days......
