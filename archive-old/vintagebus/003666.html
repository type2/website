Hey yall, I have an alternator with remote regulator that I just need to
wire to the battery.

Does the B+ terminal on the alternator go to the +(POS) or -- (NEG) on the
battery?  Everything else is wired, I just dont have any document and the
one on RAMVA P-solver neglects to show which terminal on the battery it
goes........sorry I am an idiot and have no other vehicles to check.

TIA!!!!
