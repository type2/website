&lt;&lt; So who makes the no-name worth a _at_%$# pump?  I think that I might want to 
go full flow after my mails with Bob. &gt;&gt;
Hi Dave,
Well we bought the one pump from a local swap meet used and it is working 
fine in a friends bus for the last two years.  Who's engine had huge amounts 
of copper shavings (Where those came from nobody knows!) in the sump area 
when she got her DD panel.  It looked like it was pretty well made inside to 
my machinist eyes.  Fit well.  Could have been better designed, but it will 
work.  Have seen a photo of the same pump casting in two adds in HD&amp;VWs Mag 
last year for $35-40.00.  One of the advertisers was named &quot;Latest Rage&quot; 
called them and asked them if this pump had the filter to the right (#1&amp;2 
cylinder side of the engine.) they had to have us call them back to ask 
someone who knew and the fellow who ansewered the question said &quot;Yes.&quot;.  This 
means that the filter does not interfer with the heat riser tube on the left 
side of the stock muffler.
