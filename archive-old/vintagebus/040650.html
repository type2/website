Hello All

This is a little late to plan anything ( I just found out today) but there
is a VW even called Autumn Leaves Rendezvous in southern Indiana.  We are
hopefully going to camp at Spring Mill on Saturday then enjoy Sunday there.
Just wanted to see if anyone else had plans of going?

Here is the link http://www.geocities_dot_com/MotorCity/Pit/1772/events.htm

Hope to see some buses!
