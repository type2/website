Subject: Dual Circuit Brake Conversion

After talking to an ex-double cab owner who lost his truck when he
jammed on the brakes and the left rear brake cylinder blew its seals, I
am wondering:

1. How common of an occurance is this?  The truck was a '62 and the
brake cylinders had been replaced the year before.

2. Is it possible/wise/etc to convert the single circuit brake system to
a dual circuit as found in the '67 and later buses?

3. Has anybody ever done this? Comments?

I checked the archives/sermons and could only find an entry from Bob H.
regarding the retrofiting of single circuit master cylinder into a '67
bus, the opposite direction that I'm inquiring about.

Thanks, Scott
