Subject: Re: [VB] cool decals

Sounds like vinyl graphics to me.  If someone had a picture of one, I could
have some sets made next door at the vinyl shop for pretty reasonable if
anyone was interested.  I seem to recall a story in HVW about a guy with a
green and white split that used to put a gold star on his vent console
everytime they passed another car.  Could this be the use for the stickers?
