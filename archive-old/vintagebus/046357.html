Hi Volks,
How about our painted on phrase on the rear hatch of our 1960 panel camper 
&quot;40HP at work please pass!&quot;.  Not only has this vastly reduced getting the 
finger for being slower than other traffic it has increased the amount of 
waves and smiles from the traffic passing us.  Eric&amp;Barb
