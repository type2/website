&gt;Actually, the production numbers match an early MAY manufacture, not
&gt;April. So the plate IS wrong.

I don't think I'd say the plate is wrong, just that it doesn't
represent what
we think it does.  Below is a list of chassis numbers and dates
from actual production plates for 1965 model year buses.
It shows that the dates on the
plates routinely overlap what VW released as production numbers
and chassis built in one month &quot;officially&quot;:

&gt;What we need to interview folks from the plant is stuff like - mebbe
VW
&gt;ASSIGNED a plate # to a chassis not yet built, which went to a
seperate
&gt;line for trucks.  Im serious about that - if you live in Europe, or
speak
&gt;German, the old guys who RAN the shop floor need to be
interviewd!!That is
&gt;the only way to resolve goofy stuff like this. 

No argument here.  With the 500+ production plates I have in the NEATO
Old Bus Registry, I've looked at day of week, M-Code options,
Model (Deluxe, Kombi, Pick-Up, etc.) to try to determine some 
of this.  Maybe a walk-thru Kombi going to Westfalia waiting
for a 1500cc engine on a Thursday sat for the next three
weeks because the 1500 piston plant was on strike.  It's details
like that which the shop guys could tell us.

In the mean time, we keep on guessing and fantasizing...
