 I think I know what he means, he has no idea. I did not say rig it up, I was
telling how to lower it correctly. Not those funny ways that were suggested,
if you don't know how to do it, or have never done it, best not to tell how to
do it!
I would rather see a bus that is real low, than a bus that someone has gafted
stuff into, or butchered. 
  Big nut tranny in a early bus is not correct either, but you aren't
complaining! Do what you want, to your bus, but be responsible! Stock is
stock!!
  Eric and Barb, when you put those big tires on your bus, didn't you have to
cut your wheel wells?
