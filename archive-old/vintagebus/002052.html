To whoever can help:

Is there any rhyme or reason to selecting the right air correction jet =
in a stock 30PICT 1 carburetor on a 1600 SP engine with stock exhaust??  =
My engine runs best with a 117.5 or 120 main jet.  Anything smaller and =
the power is not even or just not there!  But with the 117.5 main my =
exhaust pipe burns soot BLACK, even after hundreds of miles of driving.  =
My milage averages about 24mpg _at_ highway speeds...that seems about =
right.  Should the sooty black tailpipe be a concern??  Thanks.
