Subject: Re. Westy tow hitch

&gt;Did the person who was considering reproducing the
&gt;Westy tow hitch make
&gt;any yet? I am interested in seeing the finished
&gt;product.
&gt;Thanks, Chris

Chris,

Thanks for the interest.  I have not gon ahead with
this yet.  I have the guy to do it and the details are
preaty much there but there was not enough interest. 
If i do these, they will be right.  If i do that then
i will have to sell them for the $3-400 range.  Most
of the feedback i got did not suggest that this price
would be attainable.  For now i am pondering what to
do.

I will let you know if anything changes.

Thanks
Matthew
