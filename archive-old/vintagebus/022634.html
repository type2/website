Subject: [VB] 21 Walk-Thru Rescue trip, empty handed
Message-Id: &lt;3.0.6.32.19991113200930.01381420_at_pop_dot_calweb_dot_com&gt;

Fellow listee Tom Mink and I rounded up a truck and a trailer and hauled 3+
hours down to Fresno today to look at the 21-window walk-thru _at_ Central
Valley Classics.  Upon actually seeing the vehicle in person, I decided to
leave it lay - WAY too rough for my tastes, and I felt I just couldn't
justify the effort and expense at this point, what with a deluxe already
under the knife.  Thanks to Harry and Karl for the advance recon mission.
I think I was a bit optimistic thinking I could save this one.  Maybe
someone can, but I'm tapped out for charity cases this year. 

This bus defines &quot;project&quot; even by my standards.

The owner is Dan Cox, 559 299 5220.  The original asking price was $2500;
he begged me to take it for $1500.  I think if you stepped up with $500 in
your hands, it would be yours.  

The good:
All glass and sunroof intact
Rear seat intact
Most of the exterior trim is intact
All interior trim is intact
belly pans appeared OK
doors open and close real nice

The bad:

cargo floors, wasted
driver's side walk-thru section, cut
driver's seat rails cut
driver's seat replaced with ??? seat.
nose bashed real hard, then they mashed the inside kick panel trying to fix
it, then said screw it and layed a few gallons of bondo in there.
rockers are wasted
all stationary windows siliconed
popouts rusted
steering box is wasted, a spare comes with it
driver's door bashed, spare included
no rear bumper
extraneous hole cut in lower front nose
rear heater tube removed
front floors rusted thru
dash hacked
LR corner whacked &amp; bondoed
severe leakage from RB area, both sides
e-brake cables not even hooked up into the backing plates, hanging loose
funky mods to engine lid hinges
funky mods to front bumper
floor over engine removed and wood cover in place
