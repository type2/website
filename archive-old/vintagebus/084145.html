Hi

Please Excuse me if you have heard this before....

I have a PDF (in French) that explains the air pressure compression
theory of the early type 2 engine bay. Many people have tried (most of
them in vain) to get more air flow thru the engine compartment in order
improve cooling. The tests that were done in this document state that no
matter what speed the vehicle traveled at air would only pass the
cylinder heads at a maximum speed of 15.5 liters per second. Unless you
are willing to radically modify the compartment.

Meaning that if you travel fast with a powerful engine at some point the
engine itself will produce more heat than the airflow can disperse,
causing gradual overheating.

Besides...busses were made to go slow...with a 1300cc engine my 66 will
would only do 48mph fully loaded (downhill)

Then again I did blow that one up ;)


If someone wants the article I can forward it to you (without
translation)

Mike

&gt; We're having trouble with temp creep in hot weather in our 62 with the
&gt; 1776 motor. But from all that's said about speed and temp, maybe we
&gt; just need to accept driving slower in hot weather. We had to keep
&gt; around 55 mph to keep temp under 225 last summer.

I have the same problem w/ my 63 DC - 1776 w/ heavy duty valve springs,
9.1
compression ratio, no external oil cooler, 30 wt. Oil, &quot;big small nut
tranny&quot; etc.

Tom Buese- engines, can't drive w/ em, can't drive w/o it.
