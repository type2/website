Cold winter almost over????   Ha!  We have 2 inches of wet snow already
today and it hasnr stopped yet.

Subject: [VB] Black Cat Heaters


I was at Sam's Tuesday (Sam's is the Walmart wholesale store, or so they
say) and I noticed Black Cat Heaters on a shelf.  These heaters come with a
carrying bag, have the nice spark ignition (no matches) and the best part,
the price, $19.95 for the whole package!!

I know most of the cold weather is over, but for us, cold camping will be
here again in October!!
