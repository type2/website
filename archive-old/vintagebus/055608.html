Subject: Re: [VB] Westfalia turns 50 and pics from Germany trip.

Todd is right- we tend to think of Westfalia as the factory authorized =

From what I recall Westfalia has been around since the
late 1800s building horse drawn carriages ect...I
think you meant it is the 50th aniversary of the 'VW'
Westfalia campers...
