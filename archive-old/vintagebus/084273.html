Subject: Pressure washing longblock

As long as you have it down to a longblock, take the time to retorque 
ALL the case nuts and the heads, check the oil cooler mounts too.  I've 
found that over time and heat/cool cycles the case can loosen up a bit.  
I'm not surprised when someone loses an engine and on inspection I see a 
completely oil and dirt caked engine.  Poor thing can hardly shed any 
heat with all that dirt caked to the heads, cylinders and case.  I pull 
and retorque every 2 years/10,000 miles along with a trip to the local 
friendly we don't care what you wash car wash place.  It's also a great 
time to replace any rubber fuel lines and the engine compartment seals.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  The longblock is pretty grimy, dirty,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;messy.  I am tempted to hit it with the pressure
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;washer, would anyone recommend AGAINST doing this???.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I know that I don't want to get water in any of the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;ports or anything.
