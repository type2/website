Subject: Seats FS

Hi all,
	Time has come to clear some stuff out. First I have 4 seats, 
2 backs and 2 bottoms, look to be from a walk through. The bottom on 
the presumed drivers side has major rips and a hole. The others have 
minor rips. Upholstery is vinyl, grayish. I would like $50 plus 
shipping, and would consider offers.  I also have some '70's radios ( 
tried them only get bad disco tunes ) that I will part with for 
shipping alone. For particulars email me off list.
	Thanks,
	Mike
