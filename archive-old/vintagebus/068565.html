Subject: RE: [VB] crap case

JUST TO BE CLEAR: &gt;RONNIE OLD VOLKS&lt; has no blame in this mess; in 
fact, he has gone above and beyond a 'parts supplier' and gone out of 
his way to help. his exact quote tends to be: ' i just want to make 
you happy.'  he COULD have said 'hey, i sold em, you bought em, outta 
my hands.'  even if you assume he makes my old payrate ($9/hr!), he 
has lost nearly a grand just talking on the phone to me, rather than 
doing something profitable... although i think his conversations with 
the industry while dealing with this have taught him a lot of 
esoterica about vw  motors, so maybe i should charge HIM for the 
tuition!


we both agree that a large part of this is just my dumb luck - i seem 
to have gotten an especially bum case, as well as a part or two (some 
from other suppliers) that also failed to be in spec. my main beef 
with the case has been  the continual flow of problems, never just 
one or two minor flaws - which are seen even in the vwdobrasil or 
demexico cases - and the fact that they were promoted as a stock 
replacement case. they clearly aren't, and they are NOW sold as a 
performance-part. every thing i had go wrong (except my excess sand!) 
on this case is now a known issue, and supposedly has been addressed; 
tough titty for me being an early-adopter, but like i said, i 
foolishly believed they would have TESTED things more thoroughly 
before marketing them. i had visions of dr. porsche and his team 
driving the prototype vws 100,000 km, i guess.

here's what didn't match spec:
even tho i had it clearanced for 74mm c/w crank, i still had to hand 
clearance it more in some areas for a 69mm cw crank
cylinder spigots had areas that needed cleaning up
distributor drive area had to be clearanced (ronnie, tell em the 
story about that one!)
bearing dowel holes were drilled too deep
fan shroud had to be modified to fit case
much green loctite had to be cleaned from oil passage
dipstick tube too tight
crappy fit on oilpickup
ENTIRE case had to be ground and polished to clean sand out of the casting
that last is the last straw...and  i could spend another week w/ a 
dentist's drill cleaning all the sand from the tinier webs, and then 
i still am not totally confident the cam bore is right, so i could 
STILL have troubles ahead.
(either the bore or a gear are bad, and david crow saw no problems 
with my gears, so......)


had i KNOWN you had to blueprint, detail and/or fix these things 
before use, would i have still bought one?
yes.   vwdobrasil ain't gonna make cases too much longer now that the 
bus (and the beetle?) have ceased production, and a dwindling, 
ever-more-expensive supply of old stock, or bigger and bigger 
line-bores will be the only other options. when we rebuilt my wife's 
1950 1/2 ton, we were lucky the old engine was in good shape - try 
pricing a nos chevy 216 block!
these cases should last far longer than the  '100,000 mile' stock 
ones (which were never meant to go that long, anyway), should not 
have the bore webs deform if the engine overeheats, and should not 
have the saddles pound out leading to linebore.
when they do wear, the aluminum can be welded up and rebored to 
stock. the indestructability of the aluminum T4 cases is legendary.
the case SHOULD be the last one i need to buy... and, indeed, in 5 
years may be the ONLY one you can buy.
but i am pretty pissed that (i feel) folks were misled into thinking 
of them as drop-in replacement parts.


i have worked on this case as long and as hard as i have because
a) even tho ronnie early-on offered to replace it, i didn't want to 
cost him the money  , and
b) the longevity issues listed above.
the manufacturer has offered to replace the case at their cost, which 
i think is fair to me AND ronnie. the costs to machine it for me are 
still a problem, but hopefully not insurmountable.... expect to see 
more 'for sale' postings from me :P
what i am waiting to see right now is if the CURRENT crop of aluminum 
cases are worth it  - ronnie is pranking with one now - or whether to 
say the hell with it, get a vwdemexico case, and when IT blows up 
thousands of miles from now, hope they've worked out the aluminum 
bugs! frankly, i'm a 'pay to fix it right ONCE' kind of guy, so i 
would rather spend $2K ONCE every ten years as opposed to twice in 5, 
but you know the saying: fool me once, shame on YOU; fool me twice, 
shame on ME!




ps - ronnie noted:
  &quot;I have learned a lot on the aluminum
case, not the VW cases. Also just as a side note, the new cases are drilled
for the new brazilian dowel pins, thus the deeper holes. If you use a NEW
brazil dowel they work fine.&quot;
