&gt; 36hp case from him that he stated he did not know for
&gt; sure if it was 
&gt; nos,
&gt; but it showed no signs of wear and had old flaking
&gt; cosmilne on it.&quot;&lt;&lt;

&gt; It seems in truth, there is not
&gt; a problem with the case as much as the buyer was
&gt; apparently bidding outside of his means. 

Since there seems to be quite a difference between &quot;no signs of wear&quot; and 
&quot;completely unusable&quot;, the solution to this problem seems pretty simple.

Take the case to a machine shop knowlegeable in these cases and acceptable
to both parties.  Let them decide if the case is usable or not.  If the
case is usable, then the buyer pays for the inspection, keeps the case, 
and pays the seller what he bid.  If the case in indeed trashed, the
seller pays for the inspection, gets his case back and refunds the buyer's
money.

This would seem to be a lot more productive than taking potshots at each
other on the list.
