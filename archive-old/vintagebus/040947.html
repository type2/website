Importance: Normal

Within a month I will be changing ISP's at my home, and my PERSONAL email
address of ron_at_netcarrier_dot_com will go away forever.  I also will not be
checking busdepot_at_email_dot_com as frequently, although it will continue to
exist.  So...

Effective immediately, all email intended for me PERSONALLY should now go
to:
	ron_at_busdepot_dot_com

Email to The Bus Depot, which does not require my personal
attention/intervention, should continue to go to:
	sales_at_busdepot_dot_com

Thanks,
