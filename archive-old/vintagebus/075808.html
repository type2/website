Certainly not! I don't think she should be going back to that shop for
anything. I would have cleared outa that shop the moment they talked bad
and stupid right at the beginning.

&gt; Did you see the engine support brace welded to the frame
&gt; to &quot;fix&quot; an &quot;oil leak&quot; ? This should destroy the transaxle soon.

Pretty stupid, eh? No real mechanic would ever do anything like that.
I been tellin her to get away from that shop, but she keeps going back.

This whole case is the exact reason why I bought my bus in the first place
and decided right at the beginning that I was the Mechanic In Charge.
