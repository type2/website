&gt; thanks for the relpy-
&gt; the problem is in the vent windows on the driver and passenger sides-the 
&gt; windows are in great shape-and new rubbers this last summer-but the rubbers 
&gt; don't seemt hat tight-i mean on the vent windows i can see space between 
&gt; the window and the seal-so i don't know wht to do-in the summer it is no 
&gt; big deal, but it is cold here in the midwest- the seal are from west coast 
&gt; metric and are ok-do think they are the problem or maybe its how i put them 
&gt; on?

Hi Thomas,
OK, now for some more questions.  Where are the gaps, between the wing window 
seals and glass.  Is it between the forward U-shaped seal or the straight 
rear seal or both?
