&gt; I was just thinking the same thing, except having the vinyl shop cut the
&gt; reflective material to form a phrase like, &quot;slow moving vehicle&quot; or &quot;please
&gt; slow down&quot;.  Seeing as my bumper is not stock (custom job) and has a nice
&gt; flat surface,  I think that is the new plan for the 58 panel.

Another idea, for those who have curtains in their buses, is that there
are retroreflective fabrics out there.  I have a motorcycle cold seather
suit that is reflective all over.  A couple of square feet of curtains
would be a heck of a rear reflector!
