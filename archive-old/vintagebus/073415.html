Subject: Re: [VB] Looking for a Club/Group

Hello Angus,
 
 There are a few clubs in your area.
 
Split Bus Clubsplitbc_at_aol_dot_com 
Old School Air Cooled 

SV2's have a chapter in San Jose, a little far from you, but they have members worldwide as well. www.sv2s_dot_com 
 
I would search www.thesamba_dot_com as well, Everett has a &quot;clubs&quot; section there as well. On the advise of my attorney I will leave the motor questions to other members of the list!
 
Sean
