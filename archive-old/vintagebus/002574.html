Hey Volks

The Zebra bus has an electrical bug that has defeated my attempts to fix it
so far.

The far right hand fuse in the fuse box gets extremely hot when the lights
are switched on. This fuse seems to be the most heavily loaded of all, since
it seems to handle the main power supply from the starter (battery), as well
as serving the headlight circuit and a couple of others.

I previously replaced the stock fuse with two short pieces of cable with a
Ford-style fuse attached, but that also overheated and melted the plastic
cover.

I have cleaned up all the connectors to that fuse, but it still gets hot
when the headlights are on. I have removed a bypass wiring harness to the
headlights and reconnected the stock wiring; fuse still gets hot.

The headlight switch does **not** get hot.

Any ideas before I split the circuits on that fuse over two or three fuses
to ease the load???
