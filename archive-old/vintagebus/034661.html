 BUT, you can start a cold VW in extreme cold with a 12 volt battery.  &gt;&gt;
Hi Craig,
No problem!  We were not saying that one could not start a VW in cold weather 
with just one battery.  But that VW had made parts to help out in cold 
climates.  VW talks about batteries down to -80F!  Below that even a fully 
charged battery will freeze!  Also a half charged battery will freeze at only 
-20F.  So if one had to do in town stop and go driving which would cause the 
battery not to always get fully charged a second battery would spread out 
this usage.  Instead of a battery that sat the day while you where at work 
without support that would be half charged and frozen at -20F but two 
batteries at 3/4 charge that would stand up to colder weather without 
freezing.  Plus easier starting in even colder temps than -20F.  Otherwise 
one had better only stop thier engine for very short periods or use a battery 
heater or trickle charger to keep the battery from freezing.  Matter of fact 
main streets in Alaska have outlets for public parking to run battery 
chargers/heaters and even oil sump heaters.
