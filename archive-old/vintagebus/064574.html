Subject: Re: [VB] Middle Seat grab bar

think the middle seat bar 62-67 iscovered with the same stuff as the dash 
grab handle 62-67.   I know the dash handles are reproed, but I don't know 
that you can get a lengths to do your middle seat with.  In fact it may be 
different stuff, but it looks the same to me.   try it out and let us know.

 My '66 Deluxe middle seat is a 1/4 fold down and on the top of the fold down
 seat as well as the stationary upright seat back are the tubes where the
 grab bar mounts to.  I currently have 3 of the 4 aluminum elbows that slide
 into the top of the seat.  My question is this, does anyone have an extra
 right side elbow and also, what is the material that attaches to these
 elbows?  I have looked at pictures at the Samba and it looks as if the
 material is a white tube.  What material?
 
 Thanks
