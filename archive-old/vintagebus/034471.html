&gt; Did all 1956 buses have reflectors below the taillights? Saw 2 at Pomona
&gt;  that did not. Did different countries have different specs? Looked inside
&gt;  and saw no signs of body work or the small square hole for the reflectors.
&gt;  Also looked at 1 1956 bus after Pomona and it had reflectors.
&gt;  

euro spec 55-57 1/2 buses did not get the reflectors.  Buses that lost them 
along the way no longer have reflectors.


&gt;  What does Type 2/23 mean on VIN plate? Think I know but want to verify.

type2  means transporter (you do know that)
/23 would be model 23- kombi
this on plate on side of fresh air vent?
&gt;  
&gt;  Tacos (Thanks to London Bridge Bullis) and RICE (thanks to Stan and Steve
&gt;  and most of all Pearle from VTO) this year at Jerome. Will do it Friday
&gt;  night. Be there around 5/6 PM.
