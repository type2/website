Subject: Re: [VB] Piston Pin Bushing

  It would be easier to just replace the rods with a rebuilt set. Put the pin off the new P/L set nd see how they fit. If 
they fit nice wirh no up and down movement you might not need to replace the bushings. Try DPR machine in Santa 
Ana cali for a set of rebuilt rods, I have used them for years, great quality

&gt;I was hoping to install a new set of P&amp;C without breaking open the case.
&gt;However, in reading through the Tom Wilson book it says the piston pin
&gt;bushings in the end of the rods must be pressed in and machined to fit the new
&gt;piston pin.  If this is the case I guess that means you can't install new P&amp;C
&gt;without breaking the case?
&gt;Also, the existing bushing looks like good metal with holes that correspond to
&gt;holes in the end of the rod, presumably for oil passage.  The replacements I
&gt;got have a dingy cheap metal look and are solid except for the joint which is
&gt;a wave pattern.  Are these supposed to be drilled to match the holes in the
&gt;rod to allow for oil?
&gt;Thanks!
