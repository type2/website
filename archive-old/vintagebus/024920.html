&gt;I have been waiting for 2 months now for Das Bulli to ship the cargo floors
for my
&gt;brother's 66 Westy.  We are quite annoyed.  All attempts to contact
&gt;this buisness are in vain.  Any ideas out there?



I'll be passing through connecticut - taking a transporter test ride up to RI
on saturday, I'll be happy to rattle their cage for you if it's close to
Route 95.
