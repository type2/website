&lt;&lt; If you have any of the manuals, either for bus or bug, what would it take
for you to drop it off at a quick copy place, then send me the repo. &gt;&gt;
Hi,
Just wanted to forwarn others.  Dropping off a original manual for copying is
a bad idea.  The folks at copying places are not interested in taking time and
care doing things.  Resulting in them dropping your original manual into a
automatic feed copying system.  We have known several volks who have ended up
with several pages of thier manuals jammed in the copier auto feed.  Which
results in folds tears and time trying to pry them out of the machine while
trying not doing more damage while extracting them.  So the moral of the story
is to hand feed the copy machine your manual personally one page at a time.
