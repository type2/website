Ah ..Just when you think Volkswagen only did it this way or that way you
find out otherwise.
m-code 116. Panel van without vents in the cargo area.

    So there are bench seat panels without the cargo vents.Yes, I know a
very small fraction,but a buddy of mine has one and it had us scracthing are
heads for a while until I bought the NEATO &quot;handbook&quot; from Dave Easterwood
at the OCTO show last summer .
It stated the 116 option which we were unaware of previously.
My buddies bus is a Sundial made from a 65 benchseat panel,for a while we
wondered if someone bondoed the vents up.We were ready to tear the cabinets
out to find out.
    The Neato book &quot;Specifications, Modifications &amp; Optional Extras&quot; is a
great little book that I reference all the time.I know Dave has no more of
these books.bummer !
Hey Dave, you guys going to print up more of these books? I know all my DBG
buddies would buy one ! Then I wouldn't have to lend mine out all the time.

&gt; yes they made walk through double door panels.  these do not have the
vents at the back above the belt line.  the bench seat DD panels do have
three vents there, so that is an easy way to tell if it is original walk
through or not
