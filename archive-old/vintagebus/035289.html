Quick ?... Was sealing wax red even offered on a '65 bus? I thought it was 
called titan red at that point... Just wondering!
Take care,

sealing wax read/beige grey was available in 65.  In 65  everything had mesh 
grey (salt and pepper) upholstery.   

Titans are large mythological ogre monsters.  Titian (Tish-un) was an artist, 
who liked dark red.   VW   named a colour after the artist.    VW used Titian 
red in 66/67
