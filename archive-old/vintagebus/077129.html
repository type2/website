Subject: All I want for Christmas is:

Tristar Synchro Dbl Cab~ 

http://ep_dot_com/js/mi/n0/1670840.html
 
 
It just needs front and rear bullbars with electric winch(es), roofrack with
all kinds of Off-road KC lights, highly efficient airconditioning, an
XM-Sirrus
stereo sound system and a rear roofheight tilt/canvas.
 
If time permits, repaint it that NewBeetle blue with military aircraft AH64
style flat paint on the rockers and slightly higher.

&gt; Either that or a 3-pair pack of white socks,  a pack of boxers, one black and
one brown belt that family dog hasn't chewed... (yet)
