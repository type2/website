Subject: What's In/On Your Package Tray?

A sticker from Rex Eastman that reads &quot;Volkswagen&quot; and looks similar to the
Hot Wheels logo. Of its not the same..., Cheap Roy Orbison type sunglasses,
a few pennies, a heat sink device for electrical needs..., 10 inches of
black 12ga wire, an idle adjusting screwdriver, misc bungees, pair of
pliers, box of water fouled matches from my smoking days, 10mm and 13mm
open/box wrenches, wrappers from Trident Green &lt;bulk pack&gt; gum, a
decklid-gastank church key, old fuses,  a few stray screws, a gray M&amp;M, an
Oregon Lotto ticket from July, a plastic Kmart zipperbag with smiley faces
all over it which contains the registration and proof of insurance, and a
bunch of belly button lint. It all rattles to the right when I make left
hand turns.
