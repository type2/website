after a little further inquiry...it appears that the gauges that i have seen
rated as 6 volt, are mechanical gauges-where voltage is basically
irrelvant(well the bulb in the gauge might need to be altered).
Does anyone have any experience installing these mechanical gauges? It seems
like a lot more work than a electric gauge...I guess eric and barb are right i
may be better off installing an inverter, or search at some vw shows for a
used 6 volt gauge like claral...


I spoke with AutoMeter- the salesman there thought they used to manufacture 6
volt gauges, but do so no longer.
