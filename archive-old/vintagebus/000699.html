&lt;&lt; On the wiring diagram it shows two flasher relays...
 one for turn &amp; one for emergency, I put in a flasher relay &amp; got one side 
(L) to work, the R blinks, but REAL dim... emergency only works on the LR...&gt;&gt;
Hi David,
Sounds like dirty wiring, and/or grounds, or even possibly you turn signal 
needs to be throughly cleaned.

&lt;&lt; but back to the question, is there two relays in the system or just the 
schematics make it look that way... theres no wires unhooked to install a 
second relay, unless it
 goes in another place besides near the fuse block.&gt;&gt;
Take off the right front kick panel, and you will find the E flasher relay 
box.  Clean ALL of those connections.  Beware of any crimp on aftermarket 
connectors.  Far better to solder these on, and heat srink on them!  If all 
else fails you might just have to open the E flasher rely box to clean any 
crud/corrosion out there.  We ran a 6 volt E flasher relay on our 1963 SC for 
several years when we had it running on 12 volt.  The E flasher relay held up 
well probably due to not using it much.
