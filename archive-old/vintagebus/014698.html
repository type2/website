Some guy in the Bay Area.  And I was supposed to be getting some parts
off it before it went DTR :( - it's ignition switch matched all my locks,
and my ignition siwtch had been replaced at some time.  And it had the
correct cargo door innner handles - mine has late deluxe handles.

I have too much into mine now to be able to turn it like that.  I probably
have ~$3000 just in *parts*!
