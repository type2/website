&lt;&lt; a T3 oil cooler.  It requires less tin modification (just cut a slot for 
the oil pressure sender boss) and has more cooling per square inch than the 
t1 cooler, but its the same size...&gt;&gt;
The T3 oil coolers we have seen, and compared to the T1 doghouse coolers are 
the same except for the pressure sender boss as far as we have seen.  
 
&lt;&lt;Some even say it cools better than the t4 cooler.&gt;&gt;
If so why did not VW use these on thier T4 1800-2000cc engines?  Also we have 
compared these to other stock coolers, and the T4 cooler has 40% more surface 
area to cool with than the T3 or T1 dog house coolers.   Eric&amp;Barb
