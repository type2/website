hi! my name is thomas and i am new to the list and to vw's.
i have found a '67 bus in excellent condition. it has sat in a car port for 
15 yrs-the body is amazing and the interior incredible. i just knocked on 
the guys door and asked if he would be willing to part with it. he said he 
would. mechanically what do i need to do to it if i bought it? and what is a 
fair price? he said he would take $2,500 for it. i was thinking of offering 
$2,000 and seeing what he says. it is a split window-i think a standard-but 
i am not sure. does anyone know a good mechanic around the seattle area? 
thanks!
thomas
