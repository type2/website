Subject: [VB] Made a list of locals


&gt; I made a list of local people ..from the AIDA [I think that is correct]
web
&gt; site.  A few scared me.  Like one that said &quot;the best mechanic in town is
&gt; Raycar.&quot;

It's called A.I.R.S.( Aircooled Interstate Rescue Squad ).
Be sure to put your info up there, you already have
valuable information of where an unwary traveler
should NOT go for assistance in your area.
You do not have to be a mechanic to participate.

&gt; But I have a list now .. I am reading the idiot book while I finish off my
&gt; second pot of coffee... when it cools off some, I will make room to drive
the
&gt; bus in the garage and pull it up on the &quot;things&quot; [whatever they are
called]
&gt; and get under the bus with a light, take many many pictures and start ALL
OVER

You need a larger list. Search for swap meets
in your area. Many more and better mechanics
will turn up there who are basically off the grid.

After finishing the cover on the Idiot book,
open it up and read some more :)

Photos. We want photos.

&gt; Going to call the names on the list and get recommendations for mechanics
..
&gt; if they recommend mine .. or Raycar .. I will just move on to the next ..
&gt; don't know if I dare tell anyone my stories .. Maybe just showing them my
&gt; pictures will be enough .. who knows ...

Your backup # 2 mechanic is
only one step up the food chain.
He didn't correct the steering either.
