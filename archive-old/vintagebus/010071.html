	&gt;Did VW change the headlight switch from the foot switch to the
   &gt;switch in
 	&gt;the turn signal assembly in 66 or 67?
 
 From what I've learned over the last month, converting my 1960 6 volt
 truck to a 12 volt with a 67 westie harness (thanks Shawn), they put a
 relay in the 6 volt circuit around 65, and controlled it with the turn
 signal/dimmer switch. The footswitch went away. Then around 66, they
 switched to a 12 volt relay. I wanted to keep the original foot switch and
 turn signal switch, so I wired the headlamps direct to the footswitch (a
 la 1960) and eliminated the relay. This reminds me, has anyone ever
 shorted out the wires under the footswitch to the metal on the floor? Is
 there supposed to be some kind of insulator there? The odd thing about the
 light circuit is the running lamps are not fused, nor is the headlamp
 switch. Could be trouble if a direct short occurred behind the dash.
