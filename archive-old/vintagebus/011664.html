Subject: Belly Pan Access Holes?

Any of the buses out there with major holes in the roof or both
sides have the convenient belly pan water, dirt and rust
collectors welded to the underside.  Sunroof Deluxes, double side
door models and pop-top Westfalias (?) have them.  Maybe others.
I understand the need for rigidity here and will be replacing the
pieces on my '67 Deluxe in the future.

Having these pans solves the structural problem, but creates some
others.  First, you can't get in there to inspect/repair the
heater tube.  Second, the various holes in cross members just
create a way for water, dirt and salt to get in and rust
everything.  Third, there's not an easy way to get clean/drain
everything out.

Replacement panels can be picked up from Das Bulli Haus and with
some cutting and grinding and welding you can be back where you
started.  What I'm wondering is if there's anything to be gained
or lost by modifying these panels before installing them.  I'm
not advocating anything radical (though I'm sure someone can),
just a few access panels for long-term maintenance.

What I have in mind is this:

1)  Take new panels, determine several locations where access
could help clean or repair things later.

2) Cut holes in those locations, grind them smooth, use
metalworking tools to recess a lip around the opening, drill a
few holes and weld some capture nuts on the back (top) side.

3) Using similar gauge metal, fabricate some covers for each of
the access holes, drill holes aligned with those in the pans.

4) Install the belly pans by welding them in position.  Prime,
paint, undercoat, whatever you want.

5) Finish the access covers in the same fashion, apply a
weatherstrip or sealer and bolt the access covers in place.

I realize that any loss of rigidity or structural integrity will
depend on how many and how large these access panels are.  Just
something big enough to get a hand, a hose or a flashlight in
there would be an improvement.

Ideas? Suggestions? Flames? Analysis?

Just wondering...maybe it's not worth it.
