Subject: Re: [VB] Bus Dimensions

Big enough to hold a Bay window (68-79) camping interior if you trim it down a

You'll find bus dimensions on www.vintagebus_dot_com.

&gt; Please could anybody help me with the basic internal dimensions of a split 
&gt; screen bus, if it didn't have anything inside.  Length (with/without cab), 
&gt; width and height.
