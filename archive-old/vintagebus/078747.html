Subject: ok, who's the mech E?

Does anyone in this rag-tag group know, or know who would know, the
deformation characteristics of a solid aluminum rivet?

 

I found a place that sells a rivet with a head OD of 5.2mm.  

 

three possibilities:  

    -I measured incorrectly the size as '6mm' 

    -The rivet head diameter expands when it is set to hold the latch
and frame together

    -We're dealing with another 14 to 13 mm change issue, i.e. the
nominal metric rivet head size changed from 6 to 5.2mm.     

 

 

Or am I reading more into this whole thing..

 

 

 

 

 

David
