&lt;&lt; When changing from small nut to big nut reduction boxes do you also have 
to 
 change the axles or will the early axles work with the late boxes?   &gt;&gt;
Hi Dan,
If you mean the upper axles then yes, but not the lower stub axles.  You will 
have to remove the RGBs outer halfs, then the gears and the axle tubes to 
begin to install the later axle tubes.  To remove the axle tubes you will 
have to remove the engine and tranny.  Yes, it sounds like alot, but it is 
worth it.  Once you have taken off the old axle tubes go ahead and take out 
the upper axles and check the crown gears, fulcrum plates and the shovel 
handles of the upper axles for wear and tear and replace if nessasary!  Get 
yourself a copy of the 1963-67 VW bus shop manual to do the job right so you 
do not have to crash and burn later!   Eric&amp;Barb
