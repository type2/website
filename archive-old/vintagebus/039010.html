&gt;Why are the semaphores installed so low on the Pick-up?  My '54 
&gt;and a '57 I've seen have them in the same place as full-size Buses, 
&gt;up high right above the beltline, i.e.:
&gt;http://www.thesamba_dot_com/vw/scrapbook/55bus11.jpg

Maybe on crewcabs they'd be the same as a regular bus (anyone got a
picture?).  But in looking at my 58 European single cab, the pillar
where the bus semaphore would be located is only about 1/2 as wide as
those on buses and crews.  Look at the pictures in the above 2 links and
that last statement will make more sense.
