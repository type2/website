i've done this quite a few times just stick a paper towel in the intake 
manifold while you have the carb off.  be sure to mark the spot where it hits 
on your alternator then hit it with the grinder its aluminum so the grinder 
just zips right threw it. so be careful.    and have fun with the metal 
shavings.
later
