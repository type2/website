I wish I had the dough now. I'll be working on my 1600 DP as soon as the
weather comes back to normal. Wish I was in So. Cal. now. Too much wishing,
well it's Christmas time now so we you never know.


Merry Christmas to all!

Andre
freezing in the Midwest.


&gt;I purchased one of these to test and will keep the list up on the results.
I
&gt; also bought another freight damaged Mexican engine, this one had broken
fins
&gt; on the head, again I will be offering this one to the list first for
&gt; $1000.00 outright, with the new head installed. If you are looking for a
NEW
&gt; engine, this is a deal, as the NEW Brazil engines now cost $1450.00
&gt; outright. There still are some Mexican ones left for $1400.00.
