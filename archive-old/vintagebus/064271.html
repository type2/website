Subject: Re: [VB] The Nose &amp; Valance Seam

IMHO... do whatever suites you. If this piece was cut out you can replace it
with a piece from a donor Bus. It's hard to find a good non rusted lower
nose on a Bus that is otherwise pretty much gone. As far as the lip goes? I
don't think it serves any purpose other joining lower, upper and inner
pieces of sheetmetal. If your bodyman can replicate this piece, tell him to
start producing these and other &quot;Most wanted&quot; sheet metal pieces.

As long as you're happy with it, go for it. To some this might sound like an
invitation to turn these Busses of ours upside-down but really, it's your
Bus...... do as you'd like as long as it works and looks decent.

PS... I wish I had a bodyman like this here in Chitown. He could fix my
Busses nose too.....

peace,

Subject: [VB] The Nose &amp; Valance Seam


&gt; Hi folks,
----------snip---------&gt;
&gt; As such, things like(any vintage purists had probably
&gt; best avert their eyes at this point) the ball joint
&gt; front end &amp; IRS rear conversions had already been done
&gt; and done well mind you.
&gt; He'd also cut out some rust, including a 4 to 5 inch
&gt; high strip right across the front behind the bumper
&gt; where of course all Splits rust.
&gt; In the process, as many of you would already be saying
&gt; to yourself, he also cut out the flange on seam
&gt; between nose panel &amp; the front valance.
&gt; I spoke to my panel beater today &amp; he asked if I
&gt; wanted him to fabricate a new one.
