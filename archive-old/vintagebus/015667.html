Just because you pays only $9 for an item, what does
that have to do with its weight, size and therefore
shipping cost.  It could have been a engine case for
all we know?

Also, another very valuable point here (being an avid
eBayer) $4 for priority shipping anything is a steal,
and in fact is only cost!...Try buying parts from ANY
major VW parts suppliers...Koch's Wolfsburg
West..ect...check what they charge for shipping...you
will cry!!!  it is outrageous...what like a $8-$10
minimum shipping charge for anything!!! Even like a
screw!  I bought 2 little plastic sunroof runners from
Koch's last week...weighed maybe 1/10th of a lb
max...was charged the 'minimum' $8 shipping charge! So
seems you are paying for their time packaging and
shipping which 99% ebayers don't.

Just seems a $4 charge for priority mailing in a box
is cheap...again it is actuall cost!  So blame the
post office not the seller. ANd if it is a real
problem just don't buy it is that easy....I have done
it for overseas stuff many times.

&gt; &gt;  I bought a $9 item...the seller is going to
&gt; charge me $4 to ship it
&gt; &gt;  priority!!!!!!!!!  Better day on that.  Send it
&gt; cheapo or don't bother. &gt;&gt;
