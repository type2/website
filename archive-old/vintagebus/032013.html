&lt;&lt; I have a balanced  1600 SP w/  a mild cam and a set of dual kadrons or a 28
pci w/o venturi and headers in my bug that I could swap into the bus but not
right away.
 I drove the Kombie from FL to CA were it waits for me to ship it to Hawaii.
The scarriest part of the trip was not the breakdowns but the lack of power.
my 69 Westy didn't have this problem and it had a SP 1600 as well...   &gt;&gt;
Hi Ken,
The first thing that comes to mind is that for the anywhere up to 6,000 miles
the rings are wearing into the shape of the cylinders and until this process
is complete you will not get your full HP and Torque.  Also having the engine
setup right and that is many differant things.  Chosing the right carberator
for the right reason is a big one.  The bigger the engine cc the bigger the
carberator venturi must be, or on the other side of the coin the higher the
engine RPMs the bigger the carb venturi is needed.  The thing is if you are
not running a big cc engine and/or not running high RPMs then big bad carb/s
might not be what you need.  We are running a single port 1641cc with a 30
PICT-1 and we have just gotten the carberator jetting right for the size
engine, 40 HP air cleaner, stock bus 1600 muffler and 7.1 compression.  It has
real good torque, which means that it does real well up hills.  From what we
understand the differance between high HP which occurs well above the high
point of torque RPM is that HP is good for the short time from stop to the end
of the quarter mile.  While torque is what gets you up and over the hills.
Kind of like being personally able to pick up a 200 Lb. engine, but would not
want to try to hold it there for a half hour or more!  You might want to try
out a single stock carb and measure the jets with the $25.00 tool you can buy
at your VW FLAPS (Friendly Local Auto Parts Store.) and see if that makes a
differance.  Eric &amp; Barb
