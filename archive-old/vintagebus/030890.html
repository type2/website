Subject: Hursts

In regards to the repro Hursts that are up for sale on thesamba:
Has anyone seen these in person?  I heard they were at Red Barn.  I was 
talking to a certain someone about them online earlier and he really 
didn't give me a decent opinion on them.  I'm sure he'll have something 
to say about them :)
I think the mounts are a bit off, they don't look like the real Hurst 
mounts I've seen before in person from what I remeber.  I don't think 
that they were made to go on non-ribbed bumper buses though were they?  
Any opinions on these?  Is this a *good* repro?

Isaiah
