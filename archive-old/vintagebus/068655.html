Subject: Re: [VB] Friday: Bus sighting in a movie

It's a 15-window that's missing a rear bumper.  The first time I saw that
commercial was before a movie in a movie theater.  So it was pretty big, and
it was awesome.

&gt; Last night I saw a commercial on TV for a Playstation 2 game called &quot;Dark
Cloud 2&quot; and
&gt; in it you see a house, with car next to it, speed backward through
time....the house
&gt; eventually is disassembled, the tree next to it becomes a nut again....but
if you watch the
&gt; driveway there's a short period where you see a red/white bus in the
driveway.  Very
&gt; cool!
