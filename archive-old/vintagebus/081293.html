Subject: Re: [VB] Rear tail light BRIGHT alternative?

If you look under the products heading and scan down the page, you will find
a load resistor kit to wire accross your flasher LED bulb so as to simulate
a filament bulb. Only $4.95 each. Not a bad price. For only about $25 yoiu
can equip your dub with nice really bright tail lights. The lights should
also work on 6V with about 1/2 the brightness. Just need to use one of the
larger bulbs.

&gt; I just bought some 1157 replacement leds from
&gt; http://www.superbrightleds_dot_com/
&gt; and they are much less than the ebay ones.  (About $5
&gt; each.)  However, I think that to use them, I'll have
&gt; to get a solid state flasher, because they use such a
&gt; low amount of power that the thermal flashers think
&gt; your bulb is burned out.  Tail lights look great,
&gt; though.
