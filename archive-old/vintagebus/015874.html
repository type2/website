Well, I have a friend who did this to his bug, but without the
POR-15, several years ago.  It's the most-solid part of the vehicle
these days....

In other words, he used standard fiberglass installation techniques,
rather than using some paint-like substance as a glue.  If I were
doing this sort of thing, I'd POR-15 it, let it dry for a day, then
layer up the glass on both sides (making sure that the inside and
outside layers were bonding to each other through the holes).
