 Hi Clara,
 Take a engine case off the shelf or take a look at any of the photos or 
 drawings in the repair manuals of shots of the case halfs.  The distributor 
 drive, and cam gears are all in a rear chamber almost sealed from the sump 
 and sump stainer area.

hm, didn't think about that.  STill, I have used a magnet on a flexible stick 
for many awkward dropped metal items.  Perhaps down the distributor hole 
would be better.  May be worth a try.   magnet on a stick is also very good 
when removing rods from a shortblock, in case the cap drops into the case- 
makes it much easier to fish it out.
