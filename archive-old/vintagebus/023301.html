Subject: Spot Welders?
Mime-Version: 1.0


Anyone have any experience with spot welders?  There's a Hobart 115v model
that looks promising; it's $360 on the Harbor Freight site, $450 on the
Eastwood site.   The problem with these is you have to have access to both
sides of the work, which won't work for large areas like the cargo floors,
front floors, etc.  There's another one which works with an electrode
welder, and will work from one side, but I don't think it works with a wire
feed welder.
