Subject: re:hot start-starter relay

i am a bit confused on this, so i will try to bypass altoghether agina now
that it is light out.

in my notes i took when dismantling the starter relay to move into the
engine compartment i noted that connection 86 was the ground.

Matt seems to agree with me,or at least it appears that way :)
he wrote:&quot;This is probably OK.  85 should go to the &quot;start&quot; wire coming from
the ignition key (usually red) and 86 should be grounded.  85 and 86 are the
coil.&quot;

yet at the site http://www.oldvolkshome_dot_com/hardstart.pdf

the diagram shows 85 as the ground.

more questions on this-
just trying to determine where the problem is...if a starter goes bad does
that mean it will never work-or may work intermittently?, same question for
solenoid.

if you push start the bus does the starter or solenoid need to be working? i
don't fully comprehend how the whole push start thing works-just that it did
yesterday.

my battery reads 6.1 with no load, i think it read something like 6.25
before i did all this work. perhaps sitting in the basement it lost some
juice.

i read at http://www.oldvolkshome_dot_com/hardstart.pdf that the solenoid should
be lubricated, maybe mine is dry inside-would that cause these starting
problems?

again thanks for heloing get it stared last night-i think i somewhat
properly cured the paint, although i didn't let the bus run for a full
hour-due to the rattling noise making me nervous.
