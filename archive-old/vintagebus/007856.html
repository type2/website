I have accomplished this successfully exactly once. The dealio is, when you
buy the seals that ain't got no square holes in them, you can do this. If
the holes are cut, you're assed out. What you want to do is cut only three
sides of the hole, leaving the rubber attached as a tab on the inside edge
of the offending hole. Cut the hole undersized on its' length to the inside,
(trapezoidal) so that it stretches the rubber lengthwise, this helps to
displace some of the pucker. When you install the window frame you fight,
cuss, cajole and get that tab trapped down in the hole on the inside so that
it holds the rubber flat. On some wallered out door frames you may have to
shim it, but it really does work. What a pain in the arse. The forward hole
one can also be similarly treated, but you want to leave tabs on both sides
so it holds the roundy parts tight. If I was unclear, I am sorry but I have
much drinking to get caught up on. The Tequila has been calling me all week
and today the shreik was almost unbearable, so I rushed home to see what it
wanted. It says that the answer is a ways farther down in the bottle. We all
seek the truth in our own way.......

&gt; You know what I'm talking about, that little hump that occurs in the seal
at the bend in the door, just at the trailing edge of the front vent window.
Now most people leave it there, or cut it so that it lies down flat.  But
you'll notice og seals lie flat without cutting it.  What's the solution to
this?  (besides trying to locate NOS seals).
