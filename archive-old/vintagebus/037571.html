  If he can't decide inside the first 2 weeks then too bad. Him sending you the 
other part ment that he was happy with the trade. End of story.
  At least you got your stuff. I sent a check for some parts to a guy. Check 
cashed and cleared. 2 months have gone by and still no parts. The worse part is 
that I'm getting the parts are for someone else.
