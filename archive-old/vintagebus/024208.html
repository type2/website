Spotted this one yesterday in Auburn (30 mi E of Sacratomato)

'55 appears to be a transition year from the VSSTSMOE, and this
truck has a mishmash of items from both sides of the change.

Appears to be a '55, 8 vent louvers, non-barndoor, but with some
later items, tail lights from a '58-61, bullet turn indicators, not
semaphores, full width dash, church key engine lid, wrong
front bumper (from a deluxe with overiders and alu trim painted
black, no rubber), no rear bumper.  Single treasure box opening
on right side, unable to open.  No center brake light on engine lid.

15 inch tires, chrome original style rims, chrome hubcaps.

Bed and gates in great condition, RF jack point ripped off,
others clean and rust free, a little rust starting on R rockers,
was dark green metallic at one time, now bottom half primer.

Unable to open engine compartment, so no VIN number ID,
plate on overhead vent missing.  Gotta get me a church key
for such occasions.

530-887-1826, owner wants $2200.

Happy hunting.  (wishing I had some extra $)
Now, if it had been a '52 or earlier with the smooth gates . . .
Ya wouldn't have even heard about it being for sale . . .
until after I had snagged it.
