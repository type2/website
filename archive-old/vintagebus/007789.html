Subject: 69 front beam.

Spent a couple hours at my local Pick and Pull yesterday.  Earliest bus
there was dated 12/69 on the drivers side door jamb.  Would that make this a
69 or early 70?  I guess that would tell whether or not this is the beam
that bolts up to splitties to get disc brakes or not.  I'm not interested in
it, thought someone else might be.  The yard is in Fairfield, CA.
