Subject: OCTO and slew of questions

Good-day volks junkies,
I went to OCTO this past weekend and I have to say... wow! I have not
seen the likes of so many beautiful and exotic busses. An ambulance
and at least one (of three!) fire truck that looked like they were
brand new, complete with all the stretchers, hoses, jump-seats,
sirens, lights, decals,etc. All that removable stuff that you would
expect to be lost and gone with the middle seats and hoover bits. The
guy with the fire truck said the pump engine had only 84 minutes on
it. Now wouldn't you like that in your bus? A postal van, a couple of
sales vans. Thanks to all who help keep that history intact and alive,
a moving museum. And that Westfailure sure makes a statement. Maybe
several.
My excuse for the trip was to buy old parts, and I did pretty good. I
got a 15 gallon gas tank to replace my 11 gallon. Supposedly the
sender works, unlike my current one. Any suggestions on what to do
with the vent outlet in the bay tank? Plug it or rig up some vent
system like in the bays? I got a somewhat rusted but I think
repairable stock muffler to replace the ugly extractor thing, and a
vacuum advance dizzy to replace the 009. The dizzy is 043 905 205K.
The nearest I could find in the archive dizzy page was 043 905 205D,
for a '71 bus. Would this be a refinement of the same dizzy, or
something different altogether? It does have a 050 on it, above the
VW/Audi logos. Any timing advice? Also some singleport cylinder cover
tin and a singleport intake manifold with the thought of ditching my
leakpronelooking aftermarket dualport intake manifold with
leakpronelooking adapter for the smaller 30/31 carb in favor of a more
straightforward system. So I will need the new heads, and I think a
couple different cylinder studs on each side of the case, is there
anything else to a dualport to singleport conversion? Other than those
upper cylinder cover tins is all the sheetmetal the same? Are the
below/between the cylinder pieces the same when the different studs
are used?
What I didn't find was big nut redux boxes, as my passenger side
spring plate is welded to the redux box and someday I am going to have
to deal with that. I have failing synchros and this little
double-clutch dance I have to do to get the bus into third. Small nut
sets were available, a lot of guys in LA love a fast lowered bus, but
am I right in thinking those won't help me? Does anyone on the list
have big nut redux boxes they might sell me, especially someone on the
west coast of USA where I could pick them up at a show?
The trip down was great, a cool weather and a tailwind kept me
cruising at 60 for hours on end, something I don't get to do in the
heat of summer. Crossed the grapevine in third and 35, oil temp stayed
where it should. LA traffic reduced me to a shaking wreck and I sought
refuge on a beach a few miles from the Transporter Garden. I was
settling in to sleep when the beach rangers came along with bright
lights, loudspeakers, and inhospitable attitude, and kicked me off the
beach. I ended up camping behind an autobody shop next to the show
site but at that point I couldn't care. The trip home was a battle
against headwinds, sucked a lot of gas, but I am home again happy.
I hope you all had a great weekend,
Joel and the '64 Sundial
