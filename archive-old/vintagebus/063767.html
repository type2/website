Subject: Yellowstone, busses and bikes

Clara, other volks:

Better yet, take a bike.  Start at Ashton, the last town in the Idaho
valley below West Yellowstone City.  You ride up a rail trail that is
for hikers, bicycles and four-wheelers.  I did it last year a week
before the 4th of July.  We were the only ones on the trail, clear to
West Yellowstone City.  From Ashton it follows the Warm River up the
canyon and onto the relatively flat and bus-friendly Island Park area,
.
. . above that are the headwaters/springs of Henry's Fork of the Snake
River, a main tributary of the Columbia River.  Overnight, then up to
the continental divide and down into W Jellystone City.  Area is
teaming
with wildlife.  W Jellystone usually has a hippy bus or two around. 
Has
everytime I've been there.  From the city it is what, . . . 1/4 mile
to
the entrance, and from there about 30 miles to Old Faithful and even
more busses in the summer.  Fun trip.  Yes, Yellowstone was made for
bus camping!  Bears can't get in.  You gotta take bear pepper spray if
on a bike.

Best,

Curt
