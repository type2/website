Subject: 71 engine into a 65 Not!!!

From: VeeWee111_at_aol_dot_com
Hi Snoopy,
You have to use the 6 volt generator tin and a 33, 34, or the best yet is a
35mm wide (inside measurement) cooling fan.  Using any of the narrower
earlier
fan will result in cooling problems!!!  Also make sure to shim the fan
properly from the generator tin.

Eric and Barb,
I tried using the 6V tin first.  It doesn't work. The pulleys don't line up.
The gen is too short.

I then thought to try the one that worked on the 12V engine but the holes to
attach to the gen don't line up.  :((

IMO I either need a different backing plate which I don't  have or a longer
6V gen which I also don't have.

I am hoping for either another solution or someone has the correct backing
plate they would be willing to sell  or another longer 6V gen.

Anyone???

Peace Brothers and Sisters,
Snoopy
