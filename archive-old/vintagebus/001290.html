Just wanted to find out if metal roof racks came in a painted variety or
with just the raw metal finish.  I have a lead on one thats described as
being &quot;burnt orange&quot; in color and am wondering if it's worth it for me to
buy and then strip to paint or just strip.  It's also described as having
&quot;spring-loaded&quot; rack clamps.  Anyone hear of these?  I might have pics
tomorrow night if anyone needs to see it.  Thanks for any info.
