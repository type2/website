If everyone would STOP bidding on things until the last minute and just try and snipe the item (like everyone does anyway) the prices would stay lower.  Everyone knows that everyone else does this, so WHY bid before the last second???  All you're doing is driving the price higher!

I have found some things for my Westy that I haven’t been able to find in 3 years of looking in Southern CA.  If you use buy wisely and get lucky it can be a good place to pick things up... or waste a lot of money.

I was going to ask everyone what they thought of ebay,
whether it's a value or not. I live in Southern
California, so I guess I'm in a pretty good area for
swap parts and stuff.
