Subject: Original Bus information

hello All

Several months ago I sent a letter to the guys at VW in Germany in hopes
to find out about my beloved buss's info, whatever is out there.  Well
today I got a response.  Not the response I was looking for.

Here it is word for word.

Dear Mr. Jarvi
Thank you for your correspondence.
We are not in the position to respond to the contents at this time but
like to
acknowledge receipt.  Please regard this message as an interim reply.
We will contact you as soon as possible.  Thanks you for your patience.
Yours sincerely
Volkswagen Customer Relations.

Is this just a blow off.  Or will they actually get back to me.  Has
anyone else gotten a letter simulate to this?

However, everything else except the body is in German.  I can read 2
dates on it.  One is on August 25, with some german I can't read (ihre
Nachricht),  The other is Dec. 21 with some more German (Datum)  Date
maby?  I'd guess one is the day of the letter I sent and the other is
the date of the response.  There is also some address looking things at
the bottom which I don't know what they mean either.

Anyone have any experience with this.  I know some people have gotten
good responses in the past.  Has anyone else gotten this?

Thanks
Brent
