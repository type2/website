Hi Dave and list, here is pics of my `66 SO-44
dormo..pics are from when I got it out of a barn so
its a tad dirty in the pics.  Go to
&lt;http://www.glasscity_dot_net/users/todds/ebay/dormo.jpg&gt;

Drove out to my storage unit today...cold and dark but
I got the numbers for ya..I even pulled the M code
plate off and took it out in the sun to make sure the
numbers were 100% correct...there was some glue or
crap on them...but the numbers on both are correct...

ID PLATE
-----------------------------------
Typ 23
Heizig type 2/255 Aprute(sp?) S45
236 090 938
2070
950     1150
-----------------------------------


M-CODES PLATE
-----------------------------------
18 1
530
430 025 056 119 181 191
2312 523907 6090938
-----------------------------------

WESTFALIA TAG PLATE
-----------------------------------
SO44  2 4 6  1966
-----------------------------------

This bus is definitely all original as I bought it
from the original owner...even has the cool factory
belly pans underneath for strength like the deluxe
sunroof and double door buses had!

Dave if you can let me know what all these codes mean
if possible

Thanks Todd s

&gt; What I am interested in is the model # from the
&gt; fresh air vent and the 
&gt; production plate information.  I had expected 23-44
&gt; instead of 23-42 
&gt; on the fresh air vent and (A,B,C, or D)44 on the
&gt; m-code line instead 
&gt; of C42.
&gt; 
&gt; I am wondering if maybe they did not have a separate
&gt; m-code for the 
&gt; SO-44 interior.
