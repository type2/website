watch out guys.  Depending on the type of car some caps are designed
to let matter in the form of gas only enter from the outside of the
tank and some are both ways and some work as a seal so no gas can go
out or get in.  Not a good thing, your car could stall in cross
traffic.

Shawn Hunt from Ottumwa, IA was one of the cool Midwestern listees I
met at
BNNTA this year in person.  Enroute he accidentally left his gas cap
as a
filling station.  It was an original one too!  DOH!   Anyway, I made
him a
make shift gas cap out of rag, aersol can cap, and hose clamp.  Well I
got
this message from Shawn a few days later:

&gt; Erin........Hey is there any reason I can't use an oil filler cap as
a
&gt; gas cap? It fits fine.......I was just wondering

So there you go - you can use an oil filler cap as a gas cap and I
wouldn't
be surprised if it worked just as good the other way around...
