&gt;I've put 3 wiring harnesses in different year splits, and have this to
&gt;add.  [...]
&gt;-  the biggest danger is the front headlight loom, it is now fused in the
&gt;kits, but boy are you in trouble if you don't know the gray and brown
&gt;wires in the headlight bucket proper placement.  Pay close attention to
&gt;here or it will take microseconds to fry.

I'm curious about this.  From looking at the wiring diagrams, from _about_
'55 to '62, the low beams weren't fused but the high beams were.  Before
and after those years, both low and high beams were fused.  If the new
harness has fuses where the old one didn't, how is it done?  Do you need
to get a stock fuse box with more positions, or are there inline fuses?
If inline, do they take pointy-ended fuses or square-ended ones or blades
or...?

&gt;-  bad grounds are usually the fault --  when all else seems to check out.

Seconded... My left tail light wasn't quite as bright as the right one,
and it came on slower than the right when I had the hazards on.  I had
convinced myself that the bulb holder was tight to the reflector and
the reflector was tight to the body.  Finally I added a ground wire
anyway, sure that it wouldn't help, and voila!  Nice bright quick-responding
light.
