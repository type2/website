Comeing to a bus event near you soon, Ronniewerks AG (or should that be AZ)
crew cab, should I make it a 4 door? That could be done. Yes it does have
Barndoor rear window clip with corner windows, no more blind spot. It is
almost a crime to cut up a perfectly restorable 58 single cab, but isn't
that what Binz did.

ps. the biggest challange is putting on the BD windshield post

making several of them in which case it would become a coachbuilt.

Barnz?!?  Careful there...

I believe Ronnie said his Binz-like Double Cab will have the rear window
of a Deluxe (with corner windows?) so it will be a one-off anyway...

&quot;May I present to you the Binz for the next century, straight from
Ronniewerks,
for 2001...&quot;
