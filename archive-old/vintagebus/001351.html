Subject: Gas guage/sender conflict - suggestions welcome.

Back when I was tinkering with the 71 baywindow gas tank and sender unit, I
distinctly remember that I was getting no readings at all from the sender.
Several hours of tedious and meticulous work rendered me with a repaired and
working sender.  By the time though I had broken the needle off my stock 6v
gas guage on the 66 bus.  This was no biggie as I suspected I would have to
replace the guage anyway.  I ordered through RMMW, a VDO guage for a
baywindow bus.  Now that everything is hooked up, I barely get a reading
above E when the tank is about full.  Am I going to have to spring for the
matching sending unit or do you think I could mate up the 71 sender to the
67 guage?  Should I just try it and see?  Does anyone have a real-world
experience where they hooked up a baywindow sender to their 67 stock guage
and had it work well?  I'm guess that the quick solution to all this is to
order a sending unit for the Royale VDO guage that I bought but it sure
ain't the cheapest.  Thanks for the help all!
