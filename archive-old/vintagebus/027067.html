I recently saw the article in Hot VWs about installing Bosch H4 halogens

I'm
currently running low-end incandescent 12V lights that don't throw a lot
of
light, especially in the valley fog.   Does anyone out there have
first-hand
experience installing these on their bus.  If so, how do you like them??

I would highly recommend these lights for any bus.  All you need to do
is just swap them with your existing headlamps.  H4's put out alot of
light.  I have the stock removable bulbs in mine and I get high beamed
even when my low beams are on.  I have them in both my bus and bug.
