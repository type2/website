&gt;Adding grounding wires to the rear bulb holders is
&gt;doubly important for the tail lights!

I can vouch for this.  My old tail light assemblies didn't have gounding
terminals and the ones from my friend Bill May did.  I ran some new
grounding wires to a centralised grounding point on my 66 and so far,
everything is working great.  I can't believe that VW actually expected
those 2 little screws that hold the chrome lens ring on to be a good ground.
I guess they found out that it didn't work very well at all.
