Subject: Izzy

It just amazes me that Iz can stay in business. I tried to reach him for a
couple of years after he promised to replace these defective safaris I
bought from him. I ran into another guy at a car show this month who had
more or less the same experience.
I have one of his stickers in my window. I have written into it &quot;They leak,
ask me!&quot;
I'm advertising for him.
Sonney
