Erin and other listies
    We have all been sick and tired of working on our busses and the
Nebraska heat that Erin has been working in to get this bus going has been
brutal.  I hope to get down to Erin's house and help him get back to his
heads.  He is the expert and I will follow his lead but I think that it has
been a hot day and Erin works outside with heavy materials and is just
tired.  I hope!!  Erin lets just do it.  I could come down tomorrow night
and get up and do it on Sunday.  Get some sleep.

Subject: Safari Windows for your help.


&gt; Tonight I tried to make a tool that I could use to compress the valve
&gt; springs and attempt to remove the inner spring.  Nothing doing.  I laid
&gt; there under the bus for quite sometime wondering just what the hell I'm
&gt; doing.  I've devoted my life to getting this bus running and I'm really
sick
&gt; of it.  It will just be sitting the driveway until it's fixed or sold and
I
&gt; can't spend anymore money on it for awhile.  In desperation, I offer the
&gt; following deal:
&gt;
&gt; If someone in the area would like to use my towbar and tow my bus away
&gt; someplace and fix it for me, in exchange you can have my wolfsburg safari
&gt; windows - brand new - never been installed.  What you have to do is
somehow
&gt; remove the inner valves springs and figure out where all my oil is coming
&gt; from and you can have the windows.  If you're a good mechanic, this might
be
&gt; a deal, and if you suck, then probably not.
&gt;
&gt; It's evident to me that the engine will just have to be torn down to the
&gt; heads in order for the valve springs to be removed and I'm simply just not
&gt; in the mood to do it.  I just want to drive my bus and enjoy it without
any
&gt; more back breaking labor being put into it.
&gt;
&gt; If you want to work in my driveway and use my tools, stay a night or 2,
and
&gt; eat courtesy of me, then have at it. I'll help you put the engine on the
&gt; stand and take it down but you do the rest.  I can point out what things
to
&gt; watch for (engine tin maladies) but the rest is your game.  If you work
well
&gt; and meticulous and solve my oil leak situation, you take home a new set of
&gt; safari windows.

&gt; I promise to leave you alone if you choose to work here.  At this point, I
&gt; don't even want to look at the damn thing.
