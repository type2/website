Subject: Need choke cable hole location in fan shroud!
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

Hi Volks, 
We are installing our choke cable in our 1960 panel camper conversion.  Need 
to figure out where to drill the holes through the dog house fan shroud and 
we do not have any 36HP shrouds at present location to use as a template.  
Just a measurement from the top of the accelerator cable hole to the bottom 
of the chole cable hole on the rear of the shroud should do the trick!   
Thanks, Eric&amp;Barb
