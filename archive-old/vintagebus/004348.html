It is now around 8:30 Friday night, inauguration day for the first ever
Everybus -Type2_dot_com camping event.  Dave, Jonathan, George, the Mini-vanites
and I have just completed one hell of a good days worth of driving.  My ass
hurts, my knee hurts (motorcycle accident when I was 18), my eyes are tired,
the bus is tired.  The 1st person to greet us turns out to be Chris, the
event organizer.   Chris was quite jovial, and explained the fees, where to
park for each, the conveniences, etc.  I did my best to be cordial, but at
that point all I could think was &quot;Just tell me where the hell to park!&quot;
&lt;grin&gt;.  Dave and I made a round of the camping loop to prospect for a site,
and eventually pulled into the center loop opposite the fire place exposure,
and the 'stink-foot' encampment.  It was a good deal away from everyone
else, but not so far as to exclude us from the event.

In the dark, as best I could tell it was quite a nice little camping loop.
It was arranged in a big circle, with all the sites forming the perimeter
having electric and water(?) hookups, and the grassy area in the center was
for more primitive and/or tent camping.  In the very center of the loop, was
a very large public pavilion, with a stone fireplace, and lots of picnic
tables.  It all seemed very well kept, and in great condition.  There were a
few trees scattered about, but mostly we were in a giant clearing, with 95%
or so of the trees surrounding the loop.  Nearly all of the electric sites
appeared to be taken, and the area in front of the fireplace was heavily
encamped as well.

With our parking places chosen, it was time for me to get to work setting up
my new German Reimo camping tent purchased from fellow Missouri Micro Steve
Lashley. I bought it back in December or something as a Christmas gift to
myself, and this would be its maiden usage!  Setting it up in the dark was a
bit of a challenge, but the frame assembly is really quite self-explanatory
once you get all the poles laid out in front of you.  The hard part was
figuring out the canvas.. which way was front, etc. since I had never
unpacked it before.  It took the help of Dave to get it draped over the
frame properly, but, I'd say in no longer that 15-20 minutes, I had a very
nice, and very large side tent attached to my bus!  Whew!  Time to bust out
with the brews!

The poison of choice was some fine Irish Stout brought with me from St.
Louis,  and it didn't take long before I was 'feeling no pain'  ;-)   Almost
as soon as I got the tent set up, long-time friend and fellow photographer
Neil Pickett arrived, directly from Kelly's shop after a long days work on
his 58 deluxe, &quot;Edward&quot;.  I know Edward very well.  It was that very bus
Neil was driving when we 1st met, many moons ago at the 1st ever &quot;Busses by
the Arch&quot;.  I was, oh, about 18 or 19 then, and had just gotten back into
VW's after a several year hiatus.  Neil wasn't even with Mary Kay back
then...  I don't remember the name of the young lady with him, perhaps she's
off getting tetanus shots somewhere?   ;-)

Neil and I took some time to catch up, but we quickly moved on to other
socializing...  Neil and I would have plenty of time to visit later on...  I
am absolutely TERRIBLE with names, and I'm not that outgoing to begin with,
so I don't recall exactly who I met on that 1st night, other than Chris.
Sorry, but you folks know who you are!  ;-)  This was also a bit of an
unusual event for me in that there were not a lot of people I knew
beforehand there.  Usually I travel in a group of at least a few local
folks.  I spent most of the night hanging out with Dave, Jonathan and his
girl, and I remember admiring an exquisitely restored 13 window deluxe which
had bodywork done by Kelly.  The broad side of this bus was SO STRAIGHT, you
could have shaved yourself with an old-fashioned straight-razor in the
shine!  It was better than factory!  I also recognized quite a few faces
&gt;from the Blue Ridge campouts, but like I said, I'm terrible with names.. the
only one DO remember for sure was Judy Neville.. and that's prolly because
at nearly every Blue Ridge campout she always seems to end up at a site
directly across from me ;-)

So, for the most part, I spent what was left of the evening enjoying my
Irish Stout, and listening to all the bus banter going on.  It was oh, I'd
say about 1 or 2 AM when I finally headed for the comfort of my SO-33 bed,
when I happened to look up at the sky while walking through the clearing.  I
was in awe.  It wasn't quite the best gazing I'd ever seen, but it was hell
of a lot better than the array of stars we get to see here in the urban
lights of St. Louis.  Blue Ridge is VERY good, but most of the campground is
under the forest canopy, which does not lend itself to star-gazing.  But
here I was, standing in this clearing, staring up in the sky in slack-jawed
wonder. It was perfectly clear that night. And the clearing along with the
surrounding circular arrangement of trees around the perimeter, gave the
feel of looking right into a globular star-chart, or sitting under the dome
of the observatory where they project the stars in one of those 'shows' at
the planetarium.  It wasn't clear enough to see the milky way, or shooting
stars... hardly even clear enough to easily make out Ursa Minor for that
matter, but with a little concentration, I was able to make out all of the
major constellations of early spring. Bootes,  Leo, Cygnus, and all of Draco
were just a few of the more exciting to view for once. Mars, Neptune and
Uranus were also out.  Pluto would have just been inside the Constellation
Opiuchus as well, but it would have taken a pretty darned good telescope to
bring him out!  I went to sleep that night with the hatch-top wide open,
gazing out at the heavens above... I only wish the gazing were this good
&gt;from the roof of the library at school last semester, when I took my course
in observational astronomy.  With a sky like this, I could have run through
the entire star catalog in one marathon-night session! BTW, if you own a
Palm Pilot, there is an INCREDIBLE star-gazing app you can download from
http://www.star-pilot_dot_com  I couldn't live without it!

The exceptionally clear night would turn out to be a bit of a curse though,
as I was not able to sleep very well.  I kept waking up finding myself
colder and colder.  At one point, I awoke and looked at the antique
&quot;Tel-Tru&quot; thermometer on the closet, to find it reading 32 degrees!  That's
a big fat ZERO for all you Canadian and Euro readers!  Brrrrrrr!  I had
every single blanket and article of clothing I had with me on, or on top of
me, and I was STILL freezing my type2 butt off!

When I finally got up the next morning (when I just couldn't hold it any
longer.. lol) my suspicions that this was a very nice campground were
justified...  Neatly manicured grass, clean facilities, the works!  Mitch
had also arrived at some point in the night, and parked his Euro-panel right
next to Dave and myself..  good thing I didn't walk right into the sucker!
I never even saw it there in the dark! Mitch's bus is especially kewl, since
it used to be a commercial panel for a German Conveyor Belt company.  It
even still has the commercial lettering hidden underneath the gray and black
primer job on it.  Also arriving under the cover of night, was David
Raistrick, in his newly acquired SO-44 Westfalia, complete with original
sales literature! This was definitely my favorite bus of the campout.  The
sales literature was also very entertaining to read, as it was SO VERY
German translated to English...  &quot;Volkswagen Camp-Wagen interior!  Easy
install, big smile you!&quot;

Most of the morning was spent wandering around admiring all the buses,
chatting with a few folks, and getting to know one another. I got to spend a
little time getting to know Richard Palmer a bit better - someone I've
always run into at BOTBR, and other campouts, but never had a chance to
really talk to.  And I also FINALLY got to meet David Raistrick, as I had
mentioned.  I also ran into Chris, who threatened to break my legs if I
didn't give him 20 bucks.  I obliged.. hey, I don't want no trouble here
with these late-model bus folks... they get pretty onry ya know! I was
pleasantly surprised though, to se the number of splitty busses in
attendance.  Both Dave and I feared that we would be about the only ones
there with a split!

About noonish, it was time for the caravan to Kelly's AKA Metal Wizards shop
for some educatin' on the finer points of bus restoration.  Dave, Mitch and
I all squeezed into the front of Dave's single-cab, and brought up the rear
of the caravan.  I believe David Raistrick was in the lead with his SO-44.
A few wrong turns, and a quick jaunt on the highway later, and we were
headed to Kelly's!  Mitch had no idea what way David was going, and he
directed us down a sub-division street, which got us to Kelly's place a full
5 minutes ahead of the rest of the caravan!

Kelly's shop was pretty darned kewl.  Very large, very clean, and very
professional looking for somebody who works out of his home basically.
There were many busses there, including a 67 pop-top Westy, a 'restored'
deluxe from Kalifornia, Neil's 58, and Danny Morganelli's burned-out
flip-seat Westy. :(  The so-called 'restored' deluxe was quite a pitiful
site.  This thing must have had about 10 gallons of bondo on it!  At least
an inch deep in the corners, complete with sculpted in trailer lights, and
the front was COMPLETELY bashed in, with a few gallons of bondo smoothing it
out.  The truly atrocious part though, is that the bond-job was really quite
good, and I thought to myself, for all the skill, and time and labor it must
have taken to smooth out the bondo this good, they surely could have just
fixed it RIGHT, in less time, and probably cheaper!

Neil's bus was quite a site to behold as well.  They had completely removed
the starboard side rocker, the whole of the cargo floor, and about the lower
4&quot; of the front skin.  All that was left of the cargo area were the frame
rails and the remainders of the cross-members.  Man, that bus is rusty! When
the lower section of the front skin was removed, that also revealed a VERY
old collision repair to the front.  Just under the skin, you could see some
buckling of the edge of the front floor, and &quot;pocket' areas of the front.
Not to worry about Edward though, Neil has a large stash of NOS and
otherwise perfect repair panels to be welded in!  Kelly estimated about 200
hours of work, but with Neil helping out, they think it will go a lot faster
than originally projected!  I can't wait to finally see Edward restored!

One other very depressing sight at Kelly's was Danny's burned-up SO-23(?)
flip-seat Westy.  Anyone who has ever been to BOTBR, or prolly any other
south-east show or camp-out before will remember this bus as a PERFECT
example of a flip-seat Westfalia.  Complete with hanging lamp, rack, tent,
port-a-potty, and factory safari windows.  I'm told it was supposed to be
sealing wax red, but it looked more like a peach color to me.  At any rate,
this bus was absolutely PERFECT, and last year while cruising on the Blue
Ridge Parkway, Danny had an engine fire that got out of control. Three whole
fire extinguishers were dumped on it, but I suppose the case had already
caught on fire, and that was all she wrote.  The fire burned so hot, even
the generator stand was melted. The Roof rack burned, all the cabinets were
wasted, and even the 'one-eyed duck' up in front seemed to have gotten a bit
melty.  Danny was actually there that day getting ready to part the bus out.
We had talked quite a bit last year at BOTBR, being that I had just gotten
my own hatch-top camper, I found him to be very informative, and I learned a
lot about early Westies from him that weekend.  On this occasion however, I
was at a total loss.. I couldn't even bring myself to say hello, for fear of
not knowing how to properly express my sympathy...  I was staring right into
the heart of every bus owners worst nightmare!

With that done, Dave, Mitch and I all crammed back in to the front of the
single-cab, and made our way back to camp.  After a quick stop at a local
Wally-World for some much needed supplies, and a stop back at the corner gas
station where I purchased some of the dreaded &quot;Tequiza&quot; (hey, I was out of
the Irish Stout!) we were back at camp, munching on Cracker Jacks, and
fixin' some lunch.

After that there was more walking around the campground, as even more new
busses had shown up while we were away. Late arrivals of note was a 58(?)
panel with safari windows, all restored and beautiful, a couple of split
Westies, complete with wood-slat roof racks, and a 52(?) split-window
Beetle, one of the finest examples of such an early Beetle I've ever seen.
At some point, David Raistrick and I hooked up, and had a conversation on
photography, computers, the list mentality, and life in general.  The
somehow led to meeting John Yust finally (one more of those folks I've
always seen at other events, but never really met). John has a red/white 21
window with the plates that read &quot;FURTHER&quot;.  He's an old-school hippie kinda
guy, real genuine, not one of those stink-foot poser types ;-)  John and I
got into a pretty good discussion over stock SP motors, vs. dual-carbed DP
motors such as his, he showed off his bus, his &quot;brew-keg&quot; arrangement (which
was quite ingenious), and basically hashed over life, the universe and
everything.

Whilst chewing the fat with John and David that the momentous event
occurred... and event which turned the whole campground on its ears, stopped
nearly all activity, and had about 99% of all the males in attendance
drooling all over themselves like rabid wildebeests.  The objects of their
affection were two lovely young ladies pulling up in a very nice early 64
21-window Deluxe! Yowsa! Women driving a bus.. lookout!  I was simply SOOOO
entertaining to watch all the guys fawn over the women...  man, I sure hope
*I'm* not ever that pathetic...  LOL   (you all know my theories on women in
busses, so lets not got here again please &lt;grin&gt;)

Not long after the arrival of the hot vixens in the Deluxe, it was time for
the 'door prize' ceremony.  Everyone gathered under the pavilion, and around
the fire - it wasn't event dark out yet, but already getting chilly. Like
always, it seems that most of the door prizes were provided by Judy Neville,
and, and usual, I forgot to bring something of my own to donate  :(.  None
of the kiddies went away without bubbles, toys or the like, and prolly a
good majority of us 'big kids' walked away with something as well. I myself
won a pretty kewl little deluxe bus replica, in a plastic display case and
everything!  Funny, I seem to have a pretty good collection of VW toys
going, but I've never bought a single one on my own!  Seems like every even
I go to, I win some sort of bus replica...

With the prizes all given out, it was time to tap into the 'Tequiza'. Well,
my 1st hint of its nastiness should have been that it's actually made by the
Anhieser Busch company, but like fool, I drank anyway.  You know how most of
us agree that about any Busch product tastes like stale horse-piss?  Well,
this Tequiza tasted like stale horse-piss with a twist of lime.  It was
NASTY.  But, it was all I had...  Up at the pavilion,  many had gathered for
socializing, making some music (thank GOD none of the stink-foots had
drums!!) and drinking, and warming up to the fire.  I even got to meet the
hot Deluxe bus vixens! (personally, I preferred the brunette with the curly
hair &lt;grin&gt;).  But man, after about 2 of those Tequiza's, I was ready to
gag.  Thankfully, Jonathan recognized my pain, and came to the rescue with a
bottle of his fine home-brew!  It was pretty sweet for my taste, and
Jonathan explained that he gives a lot away, and his wussy friends
apparently can't handle a mans beer, so he has to sweeten it up a lot on
purpose so they will drink it.  Personally, I prefer a beer that drinks like
a meal...  lol  Well. That one home-brew did for me what an entire six-pack
of Warstiener or the like would do for me, and I was really reeling from it.
And if that weren't enough, my new best friend John Yust offered a sample of
his own brew.  Wow, this would be a good night!  John had some sort of keg
and cooler contraption set up in his bus, that dispensed the fine brew at
nearly freezing threshold. Perhaps a bit TOO cold, but I'm splitting hairs
here.  Now, John's brew was MANLY..  deep, woody flavor, with a rich hops
aftertaste..  veeeryyy niccceee....   After that tankard, man o man, it was
time to call it quits.  I sat up for quite a while, listening to the banter,
watching the fire, and taking in the sounds of the &quot;Everybus band&quot;  Chris,
some guy on an electric keyboard (!), and Dave Easterwood were the main
bards I recall.  They were actually quite good... compared the many other
'campfire' bands I've heard anyway.  It was a night of Garcia, CSN and Y,
and Dylan that I won't soon forget.

That night when I went (stumbled) back to the Westy, it was already about
2:30 AM, and in the low 40's according to the thermometer.  Before hittin'
the sack, I downed a big ole glass of water to ward off the hangover demons
in the morning, zipped myself up in the fart-sack (sleeping bag for all you
folks not from the mid-west), and TRIED to get some sleep.  Really, all I
could do was lay there and shiver. The temp kept dropping down to about 30
degrees or so.  I remember Dave starting his bus up at about 5:30 in the
morning to leave for the swap meet in Farmington, and I remember the bus
start slowly to glow magenta on the inside as the sun crept up to the new
day.   I did not fall asleep until the sun was up and it warmed up a bit
inside the bus.. man, what a rough night!!  Why, oh WHY didn't I take the
time to install the gas heater in the bus before I left on this trip!?  I
was absolutely miserable both nights of camping at Everybus...
