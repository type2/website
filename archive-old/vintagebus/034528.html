&lt;&lt; 
 I'm building a motor for my 58 single cab and the motor I'm starting
 with is from a 74 bug.  So its got a dished cam in it.  I've got a flat
 cam that I want to use and I'm going to buy a new oil pump anyway.
 
 So my question is:  If I buy an oil pump for use with a flat cam, can I
 use the flat cam with no other modifications?
  &gt;&gt;
Hi Mike,
Yes it will work if the cam gear is the same size (Look for the number
stamperd on the forward side edge of the gear,) as the original gear and you
use the original drive gear on the crank.  We once knew of a fellow who did
not believe there was a difference in the cam gear sizes.  He installed one
that was to big and 30 miles down range it pushed the cam gear off.  Eric &amp;
