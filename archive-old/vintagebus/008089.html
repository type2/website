&gt; Here's the article:
&gt;
&gt; &quot;In Defense of the Original, the Venerable, VW Bus&quot;
&gt; TOM: Thanks for all of your nominations for &quot;Worst Car of the Millennium.&quot;
&gt; You brought back many painful memories for my brother and me!
&gt; RAY: Mostly for him, since he owned most of the cars you folks nominated.
&gt; Before the voting, we wanted to print one more letter from a reader who
&gt; objected to a certain nomination of ours.
&gt; TOM: In kicking off this contest, we had written: &quot;Romanticized as it was
&gt; the Volkswagen Bus got blown all over the road, didn't have any heat to
&gt; speak of and used-the driver's legs as its first line of defense in an
&gt; accident.&quot;
&gt; RAY: Bob from Wichita, Kan., begged to differ. He took a much more
&gt; &quot;philosophical&quot; view of the vehicle's characteristics:
&gt; Dear Tom and Ray:
&gt; Your description of the VW Bus was completely accurate but, alas,
&gt; pathetically unenlightened. Further contemplation will bring you to these
&gt; epiphamc conclusions:
&gt; (a) If a VW Bus shifts in the wind, it is simply because you are on the
&gt; wrong path, heading in the wrong direction. Think of it not as a
potentially
&gt; lethal driving hazard, but rather as a spiritual GPS (Global Positioning
&gt; System).
&gt; (b) Heat? Who among us has actually known heat? Is not one man's boil
&gt; another man's frost?
&gt; (c) Factually, the driver's legs are not the first line of defense. Tom
and
&gt; Ray have overlooked the thick layer of bug guts aerodynamically meshed
into
&gt; a natural and practically impenetrable polymer covering the VW Bus' flat
&gt; front. In addition, many Buses feature a front-mounted Triplated
Independent
&gt; Repealing Emobilizer (TIRE) combining the science of high-cost air bags
and
&gt; the proven effectiveness of amusement-park bumper cars.
&gt; Finally, and most importantly, remember that every VW Bus is surrounded by
&gt; the plush and cushioning aura of St. Jerry of Garcia, providing divine
&gt; truckin' guidance to freaks Deadheads, 17-year-old wannabes and balding,
&gt; 40-something used-to-bes.
&gt; I suggest you tie-dye yourselves to the front seats of a classic
splitwindow
&gt; model and hit the road for nirvana. You'll know you're almost there when
the
&gt; clutch cable goes out.ÑBob (balding, frostbitten owner of a
goatvomit-green
&gt; '76 Westfalia in Wichita)
&gt; Now, it's on to the regular mail.
