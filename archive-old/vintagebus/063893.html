Subject: Re: [VB] 6 volt batteries

or Wal-Mart for that matter..... I've got a heavy duty Wal-Mart for $59.95
in my truck and a regular one $45.99 Wal-Mart special in my Bus.... A few
days ago when temps drop down to almost zero the only thing that started
right up was my truck and my Bus... even my 4 year old Quattro needed a
jump..
:-)

I don't think you need Optima in a Bus...

just my 2 cents worth,

&gt; That was my experience when the Optima in my 911 went dead.  Before I
&gt; could make a claim, I had to undergo a convoluted charging regimen,
&gt; and if that didn't work, I would have to send it in for 'evaluation'
&gt; at which point they woudl decide if I deserved a new battery or not.
&gt; And nobody could tell me how long the 'evaluation' would take - so my
&gt; car would be battery-less in the mean time.
&gt;
&gt; I was a big fan of the Optima until then.  The one in the bus works
&gt; great, but the one in the 911 goes dead if it's not used for a week
&gt; or so - even if it's disconnected.  The bus has sat upwards of 3 months
&gt; and fires right up.
