Subject: steering lock - any know about em?

I got this vintage steering lock in the mail this week.  I know nothing 
about them.  Dont know the name brand of it. It has three stops, &quot;STOP&quot;, 
then &quot;GARAGE&quot; and the last is &quot;FAHRT&quot;.  STOP is obvious, engine is stopped 
and steering locked.  When I turn to GARAGE it does not stay there and 
returns back to STOP. But it does retract the locking mechanism when you 
hold it at the GARAGE. When you turn it to the last FAHRT stop it locks 
there and of course the lock is retracted.  Now I am thinking modern age, 
and figured the GARAGE stop would lock in this location, have the lock 
retracted and power to the coil.  The last FAHRT stop would engage the 
starter.  Is this right?  THe way it is working maybe indicates the thing is 
worn out as it does not stay at the first GARAGE stop.  This and maybe the 
key does not engage the starter and you have to have a separate push button 
starter. Anyone care to let me know how this works and maybe translate the 
words?  THANKS!!  Gerald
