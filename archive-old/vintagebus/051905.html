Subject: Re: [VB] finding TDC on a your crank pulley


From: &lt;rexrogers_at_type2guy_dot_com&gt;
&gt; What's the best way to find true TDC on your crank pulley?

Remove 3/4 valve cover.
Turn engine in DIRECTION of rotation.
Watch #3 valves. You will see the exhaust open then close. Just as the exhaust
closes and the intake just starts to move STOP.
At the point of rocking, when the exhaust stops closing and the intake starts
opening, #1 will be at TDC and your crank pulley will be at zero. IF your crank
pulley has a zero mark on it and IF your cam timing is correct. Usually cam
timing is correct, BUT not all type1 crank pulleys have a zero mark on
them......
