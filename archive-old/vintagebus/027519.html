Subject: Re: Stripped brake drum hole &amp; T-bars

Thought I saw a post awhile ago about someone who stripped a bolt in a
brake drum.  I didn't see anyone mention converting it to studs.  I
think I wouldn't blink at converting it to studs if it wasn't for show
or running mags - they would be hidden by the hubcap. Just the idea of a
steel bolt in cast iron makes me think.  A steel stud with a steel nut
seems stronger.  Besides the whole issue of dissimiliar metals in old
vehicles.  A heli coil fix is out.  A larger bolt might not fit in the
rim hole, etc. I would stud the whole drum - if one hole stripped....

Somewhat related is this T-bar lug wrehcn I got at Walmart.  I wouldn't
attack wheel bolts/studs without a T-bar, having thumped nuckles a
couple of times using other contraptions.  The main complaint I have
with T-bars is the space they take up.  At Walmart they have this way
cool T-bar lug wrench that has 2 opposing folding arms that are locked
in place with sliding sleeves so it fits in a tool box.  It is nicely
chrome plated and has both English and the sort of equivalent metric
sizes stamped in the shaft next to the socket.
Great stocking stuffer idea.
