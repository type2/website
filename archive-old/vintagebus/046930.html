This one always gets me. I used to here this one all the time, I am at a show 
and would be talking to a bus owner who did not drive his or her bus to the 
show, but was then complaining at the lack of transporters at the event???? 
And then while calling club members and local enthusiasts about the upcoming 
event they would ask me &quot;Do you expect a big turn out&quot;, right after they have 
told me they will be in the Jetta cause they have to visit the mother in law 
later on in the afternoon. Just don't drive your bus to there show, drive it 
all the time. And buses are for hauling stuff.

Was written: &quot;I drove the
F*rd cause I've been in a situation before where I'd got a clip that was
just not gonng go into a bus of mine because it was either to big or to
damn dirty.......................So, tossed all my junk into the ford, took 
another jaunt around the
lot(nice slider westy, 58 23 window fs, blue kombi that was belle, etc
etc).  Grrr who knows when mine will be there, but it will be! Where were
all the other busses at the show?!! If you got one, show it!&quot;
