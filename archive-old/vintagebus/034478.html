&lt;&lt; the driver's side front door of my '67 was rubbing at the bottom.  There 
is a specific spot (about 2&quot; wide) that was getting enough wear to cause it 
to become indented.  Is there a way to adjust the door height/angle? &gt;&gt;
Hi Gene,
Not really.  Check your hindge pins for wear by lifting the rear ends of the 
doors up to see if there is slack in them.  Then check for bent hindges or 
bent/broken areas in the doors around the hindges.   Eric&amp;Barb
