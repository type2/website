Is everyone really positive that they were &quot;turning out nearly 4000 buses a
week&quot;???

Is this an assumption because of the math between the vin #'s from the 1st
of the week to the last of the week of type2's???

If VW works like Mercedes works, then this assumption is wrong. No 2
Mercedes have the same last 6 numbers of the vin during the run from 000001
to 999999.  Let's say that in 1984 MB made the 190E [201.024], the 190D
[201.122], the 240D [123.123], the 300DT [123.133], the 300TDT [123.193],
the 300SD [126.120], the 380SL [107.045], the 380SE, the 500SEL, and the
500SEC. That's 10 USA models.....not counting Euro models.

So if you had 2 300D's, vin # 123133.1A.222200 and 123133.1A.223200, with
1000 separating them....you may only have 200 300D's built between them. The
rest would be 9 other USA models + an unknown amount of non-USA vehicles.

Didn't VW build beetles??
