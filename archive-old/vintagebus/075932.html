&gt; One thing really puzzles me.   On page 32 it states 2.7.63  1 144 303 USA 
&gt; speedo now with gear change markings.  My 63 singlecab made in dec of 62 
&gt; has gear shift markings.  Do I have the wrong speedo or were a few mph 
&gt; marked speeedos introduced before July 63  

Hi Sam,
Hmm, interesting!  Our 15DEC62 manufactured SC has a marked speedo also!  
Pretty sure it is original to the SC.
