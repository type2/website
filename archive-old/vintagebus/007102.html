Dolan made it here to Modesto yesterday about lunch time. Despite much
attention from several knowledgeable people in L.A., he is still having
overheating problems. I provided assistance in installing a variable fuel
pressure regulator he had procured in the San Diego area. The idea was to
richen the mixture by increasing the fuel pressure. This seemed to help, but
the results were still inconclusive when he left this evening about 5:00 for
San Francisco, or perhaps Santa Cruz.
