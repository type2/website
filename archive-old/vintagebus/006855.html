--- Isaiah &lt;punkerbat_at_vbe_dot_com&gt; pondered:
&gt; How would we get back
&gt; home after driving the bus to
&gt; the next destination?

Ah, there lies the rub.  I'm not too sure, but based
on the responses back, I don't think I'll even attempt
this.  If I buy the bus, I'll probably fly out and
take the adventure myself back home, stopping along
the way where ever I'm welcome.  A week (Friday night
until the next Sunday - 9 days of driving) doesn't
seem too short to expect to go 2500 miles, does it? 
I'll allow a few days of downtime, so if I get back a
little later than I planned, no big deal.

Paul
