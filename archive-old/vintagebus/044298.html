Hi Bryan,
First unless you know what you or who ever does the sandblasting is doing you 
could easily end up wrecking the VW.  Sandblasting at too high of pressure 
will just ripple the panels of the body.  Best to use sandblasting for only 
spots of massive rust and under carriage.  The rest hand and disc sanding.  
Use acid wash to remove microscopic rust from any areas that you strip bare 
of factory paint.  Try to leave as much of the original paint as possible.  
It is the best for sticking to metal and has a high zinc primer content.  
Find a zinc primer of at the least 85% zinc content, the higher the better.
