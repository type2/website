I have found a lot of tow companies and junk yards don't like to deal with
old VW's period. Most of the tow companies out here in Havasu either contact
me or will just dump a VW off without asking. Last week I had a Very
straight 69 Westy dropped off with no engine and trans, then a couple days
later a 65 type 1 with a rod knock was dropped off. So far I have had at
least 10 bay windows dumped here, but no splits,(I take that back, I did get
1 67 picture window camper last year) but who abandons them now anyway.

ps. A friend of mine is helping his friend liquidate 20 years of VW's and
parts. I am going there this weekend to help inventory all parts and cars.
The only bus he remembered off the top of his head was a 64 sliding door,
there are also 3 or more buses and some bugs, 36 hp engines and tons of
parts. I will keep the list informed as they want to dispose of all VW stuff
and DON't want to do (I'll have to wait till Friday to say) or swap meets.

I'm sure that's the case up here.  I think certain local bus folk have deals
with the junkyards.  A presidential portrait crossing the right palm will
do wonders for obtaining &quot;insider&quot; information.

&gt; some enterprising folk have a standing order for any and all pre-68
