    I have a question about rust repair. On my floor board I have a few
small pin holes and I want to get rid of them before they get worse. This
evening when I was removing the paint from the floor I notice what looked to
be brass in a couple of spaces like it had been repaired before. Is this
type of repair done with a gas torch that you would use to smelt fittings on
pipes. If so has anyone tried this for a repair method.


Sincerely
Eric, Christy, and Miranda Lykens
