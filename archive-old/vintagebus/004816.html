This is a message I attempted to post to the type4um - a website driven type
of list in old BBS fashion devoted to the intricacies of Type4dom.   Because
I'm not a member of the forum though, my post was rejected so I'm posting it
here.  Yes, I'm working on my 1776 bus doing the paperwork planning for a
T4.  I like the idea of huge displacement and torque for bus power.  Here is
my original post:

I've got 3 T4 blocks sitting around here with one complete 914 engine/tranny
combo.  I'd like to make a powerful and reliable T4 engine to either put in
my 1967 bus or 74 Super.  Either way, it would be great to take these T4
cases and put them to use.  I've read a lot of Gene Berg's information on
the use of the T1 engine and am a firm believer in building engines like
tanks so you don't have to tear them apart all the time or ride on the edge
of your seat worrying that something bad might happen.  Gene's tech articles
speak of using larger cylnders in T1's but Gene never suggested anything
over a 90.5mm bore due to excessive blowby caused by distorted P/C's from
heat and too little material left in 92, 94 and 96mm P/C's.  It's okay to
run these for drag racing but for everyday driving where tear-downs and
inspections are are not practical, this just isn't my kind of thing.  What
I'm getting at is, is there anyway we can take Gene's info and apply it to a
T4 engine and say, &quot;Okay, the cylinder wall thickness of a 90.5mm T1
cylinder is XXmm therefore, we should be able to punch out a T4 to a bore
that leaves us with the same cylinder thickness.  Further I ask:  How big of
a P/C combo can you go with a T4 and still maintain reliability for daily
driving, remove any low miles blowby problems, and still go with some higher
performance parts for extra power?  It's a long drawn out question I know -
but I want to build a powerful T4 with reliability in mind.  Thanks for
reading.
===============================

I've also talked to my brother and he seems to think that the 103mm bore is
the biggest and most reliable bore to run.  I also found out that Mark
Stephens did not have the good reputation that we all thought he did.  Some
guy posted about his T4 where he did a hole shot at 6g before lining up to
drag and the engine stopped dead with a simulatenous backfire.  It was
caused by a dropped seat on a Mark Stephens head and pieces of the valve
seat were found in the aircleaner of the carb!

I've checked out the T4 websites but all I see is, &quot;More power with
reliability, no longer do you need to start out in 1st gear in your bug, get
a big bore kit, etc. etc.&quot;  It to me like the early t1 days where people ran
the big cylinders without the proper research and just kind of experimented
around a bit.

Thanks for the help all...

Erin
