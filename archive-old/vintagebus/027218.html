Just got a 1964 standard, gonna use it for hauling down the hiway.  Any
suggestions such as what type engine to build, carbs, bumper guards,
seatbelts (two or three points), tire sizes front &amp; rear, special
whatever to keep my breakdowns to a minimum?  What parts &amp; tools should
I haul with me just in case? Would like to travel from show to show this
summer and hope to make it a pleasurable trip instead of breaking down
in the middle of podunk Kansas.  Any and all suggestions would be
welcome and thanks in advance.

BTW, what's the difference between a standard and a Kombi?
