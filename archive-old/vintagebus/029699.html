Subject: Westy interior

I was considering building cabinets in my 65 bus to go along with the
the z-bed that I think is from a late sixtys or early sevetys westy,
when a friend of mine suggested that I found out how much it would cost
to buy the rest of the westy interior. It's a non-walkthrough . I would
probably be most interested in tne front-rearfacing seat, the rear
quarter cabinet, sink/fridge, and table. I think what I have  would be
the SO-42 z-bed, but I am no westy expert, I can get the number off of
the serial number plate on the seat, if that makes a difference. Also
info on finding dimensions of the westy peices would be an option since
most of it does not seem very difficult to build or use materials that
are expensive or hard to find( as far as the cabinets go anyways ). I
have read the camper info in the library, and that is about the extent
of my knowledge. I am not even positive of what else was even offered
for camping in those years. so if there is any camping gear offered on
the 65 westy that would be really usefull when we camp out , that would
be appriciated also.
