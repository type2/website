&gt; Tonight I was working on the bus a little bit when stark reality hit home.
&gt; My bus looks like crap.

If I had a nice bus I would drive it but I don't so I drive the one I
have.It is a franken singlecab,it was a work truck at a summer camp and ski
area and is well used and beaten 50K original miles,five different colors
but complete and operating properly.It gets me around and people usually say
&quot;I have not seen one of those in a long time&quot; or &quot;I can't believe it still
looks solid&quot; and not what an ugly POS.You should also see what qualifies as
a nice  or &quot;solid&quot; bus around here in the rustbelt.
