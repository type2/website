&gt;Well you only need the rotor to point to the notch in the distributor when
#1
cylinder is at TDC on the end of the compression stroke for that is when
you
want to burn the air fuel mixture in the #1 cylinder.&lt;

Eric,
        I understand that....what I am saying is that I have an engine
sitting on the floor that will not let the dizzy slip in at TDC of #1 with
both valves closed without rotating the rotor bug 180 degrees from the rim
notch.  Normally, a flathead screw driver will fit a screw two ways and
that is the way a vdub dizzy looks but that doesnt seem to be the case.

        Am I just &quot;high&quot; or is it all that &quot;crack&quot; that we did back in
grade school?

Thanks again,

Josh Rodgers
Ponca City, OK
