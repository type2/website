Subject: more oil leak ?'s
Date: Sun, 20 Aug 2000 20:37:03 -0500
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

I've got the engine out of my westy right now repairing some oil leaks. I
can see the pulley has been throwing some oil. What is the best way to cure
this? Has anyone ever tried using a sand-seal pulley? I run one on my rail
and it has never leaked a drop. I don't know how this would work on the
highway though. I have seen seals go bad on these and when they do, boy do
they sling the oil! Stock pulleys don't have a seal, right? Help!!!
