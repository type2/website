Subject: stripped cargo door mechanism
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

So the wife's gone to bed early and I figure it's
prime time to sneak out to the garage for some late
night fiddlin' with ol' DARTHVW.

Well, I figured I would align my inside cargo door
handles the right way (both pointing up when closed
and latched, right?). Sure, I went out there to change
the tranny oil, but you how you get staring at
something and all of a sudden plans change.... 

so lo and behold I get the inner handle off the rear
door (the one without the outside handle) and the
threads for the screw to hold it in are stripped.

Now what?

Can you rethread these? Or should I get a new
mechanism?

Do I have to get it with the long bars which go into
the roof and floor? Or can I easily swap out the
center piece.

Details: '67 deluxe 21 window.

PS: Anyone got one they can part with for an honest
price or trade for equal value in Vintage Evel Knievel
toys?


Thanks,
Jason
