Subject: Re: [VB] metal flakes in oil! Help! - Painting engine case

Richard said:

&gt;If my memory of high school and college physics serves me right, the color
&gt;does matter. There's a term &quot;black body radiation,&quot; and black objects are
&gt;theoretically best at radiating heat.

Sorry Richard but a blackbody is an object that emits as much thermal 
radiation as possible. It is not referring to the objects color. See the 
definition  at 
 http://www.efunda_dot_com/formulae/heat_transfer/home/glossary.cfm?ref=black#black  
All of this discussion on colors absorbing and reflecting heat make me 
chuckle. It seems to me everyone is mixing conductive heat transfer with 
radiation heat transfer with absorbtion of heat from light sources.
A cool running engine is the result of moving air. The moving air picks 
up heat both by physical contact and radiation heat. I would like to 
have someone show me a website that shows the color of an objects 
surface affects the emission of the radiated heat enough to make this 
question even relevant. And besides the heat is transfered from the case 
to the paint through conduction not radiation so the color could not 
reflect the heat back into the motor as some have seemed to say.
Now as for powdercoating. I don't think I want to use an engine case 
that has been heated to 400 degrees for a couple of hours for the 
purpose of being encased in ceramic, which by the way is a great insulator.
