Subject: Re: [VB] Splits, Bays and the VW spirt

This may be true, but it still makes me mad when I pass a Vanagon or Eurovan
and sometimes a loaf bus, even at VW events and nobody waves. Did somebody
forget to teach them manners?

&gt; Here in the midwest, we have the best of both.  We have some of the nicest
&gt; VW people anywhere and some of the best looking busses of all ages.  I
&gt; would put the quality of our people and busses against anywhere in the
&gt; country.  I fact, at many of our campouts, we don't even limit the driven
&gt; vehicle to VW's, only to those who enjoy them.
&gt;
&gt; We honor the spirt, not just the metal.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; &gt;Yeah, but what would you rather have? Quality or
&gt; &gt;quantity?
&gt; &gt;Mike
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt; It's a real shame the split and bay guys can't get
&gt; &gt;&gt; together on the west
&gt; &gt;&gt; coast.  Here in the midwest and on the east coast,
&gt; &gt;&gt; if we did not admit the
&gt; &gt;&gt; bays and even the vanagons and EC's, our meets and
&gt; &gt;&gt; campouts would be very
&gt; &gt;&gt; small.
