Subject: im not leaving my splitty naked anymore

well,

It worries me that my split is &quot;naked&quot; as far as theft prevention
goes.  If someone twisted 3 wires together they could drive off with my
bus, so im instituting some theft prevention measures.

the first of which is to install a shifter lock, im sure these can be
bypassed but they will deter the joyrider, and thats who im worried about
primarily here in the midwest. But i am planning to enter no mans land
this fall (the southwest and so-cal) so i plan to have more in place by
then.

Then its fixing my fuel reserve tap, left in the off position it will
deter the non bus savvy..

Finally, getting a locking gas cap that i have a key for.  I have the
autozone one, and an original one, now i just have to make one that works.
(for those who didnt understand the whole autozone thing, they stock 3
different ones. One is all plastic, the other is metal but the back sides
are crimped on, and the third has a metal cap on the inside that screws on
with 2 phillips screws.  THIS is the one that is the same as the old
school vented one i have.)

Unfortunately i dont have a dead splitty tank to take the neck off of so
this wont work with the bay tank swap i want to do, would anyone have a
splitty tank neck to sell? (prefer reasonably priced of course..)

I have bought the shifter lock and it will be here wednesday, i will
report to the list on how the install went as i couldnt find anything in
the archives on this topic searching for many permutations and
combinations of shifter and lock.

take care,

Steve

p.s. i also bought grey por-15 i will see what shade of grey it is soon,
that might work well for doing the outsides of gas tanks.
