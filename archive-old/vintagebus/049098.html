It was my great pleasure to host a dozen listees at the local brewpub (political statement follows: Think Globally, Drink Locally) Missed the toy and lit show again. We did have a toy at the table and for literature examined ourselves for VW palm creases. 

One thought that arose during the quaffing was that Uncle Jerry could issue insurance policies to carry us to our final resting places in the Dracula single cab hearse. A few bucks a year from a bunch of people would keep it maintained and hire a driver to keep us out of those Cadi**acs and whatever they make hearses out of these days. Half expect a humvee hearse, so why not a vintage VW? 
Same thing for the Barnambulator. Time-share. For your low annual fee, you can drive a barndoor to Big Sur from Santa Monica and camp out in the big pines. Tint your digital pics sepia and you've got the ultimate vintage vacation.  

The shows bustled and those that camped out in the evenings enjoyed the longer greet and meet times, I suspect. Glowing reports of the Yost's campground and the NEATO problems solved around the fire at Lake Irvine were hints of this. I'll camp next year. 

Thom, you missed the burning American car in the center divider near the top of the Grapevine. We saw a couple busses putting happily along and ours did too. Jim Ellis had a big stream of Bus Stop boys asking if he needed help with his bus as he waited for his friend's jeep repair. We might bicker some with ourselves, but out in the big world we look after each other. 

Chris's wheels make a lot of sense over patched and painted steering wheels and look great. Grooves are perfect, finger knurls are full size.  I plan on sending him my two and some cores to help him out. His initial posts about gathering a number of wheels before production started made me think he was subbing them out, but he is doing the work himself in batches, and I'll support that. He removes all the plastic/bakelite from the metal armature and molds in new stuff. 
 He probably can't match the RAL2000 of my doublecab, so maybe I can strip mine, powder coat  or paint the metal in orange/yellow and he can cover it in clear urethane? Remember the clear toilet seats with barbed wire, coins or fishing lures embedded in them? 

re: C.R's disc brakes. My '63 DC has a bay '69 front beam with a bay '72 power assist m-cylinder and discs. Stopping power is smooth and strong, I recommend this combination for your drivers. 15 gallon tanks are great too, all I need now is a 3 liter bladder transplant.
