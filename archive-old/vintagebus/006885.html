1776 single port, 40 mm intake, 35.5 exhust, and this is on a single port.
3rd one I have built and in my opinion this is the ultimate bus engine. I
have run a single 34 and duel kadrons. Big valves due work thats why VW used
39 mm and 32 in their late fuel injected engines, big valves long before the
aftermarket street craze.

Pulling engines, today I pulled the engine and trans out of my side loader
and my DD and am just finished installing the trans in the side loader and
will put the engine in hopefully tonight, then I'm going to assembly the
3.88  77 4th gear trans and install it along with my fresh 1776 single port
tomorrow in the DD. So now my side loader has a late 66  4.12  82 4th big
nut trans and the 30,000+ (that's what I've put on it so far) mile New
Mexican factory engine with duel kadrons and 1.25 ratio rockers, got an
average of 20 mpg at 68 plus mph in the DD, so I hope my milage and Speed
will increase in the side loader and my DD should haul balls with the new
set-up.

Don't give up NQ, you almost got it

&gt;Why pull the engine to remove the springs?Pressurize the cylinder with shop
&gt;air and remove the springs and install the single springs.


It's got dual springs and my puller will not get in behind the center
spring.  I'm going to try and modify my tool tonight to grab both springs to
try and prevent having to yank the heads.

This whole thing with my bus is absolutely not fun.  I've been told to use
stock heads, large valve heads and I've been told to use neither.  I can say
that with stock heads, my low end was there but at highway speeds the engine
just fell off.  With these big valve heads, I've lost a little bit of the
low end but once I put the pedal down at highway speeds, hold on!  If I had
smaller tires on it would pull even harder.  So I guess for those that think
a large valve head on a 1776 isn't the way to go, I have to disagree.  It
put the power where I wanted it - at cruise!
