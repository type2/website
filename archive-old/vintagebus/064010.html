Subject: Re: [VB] Back on list w/ a fine(?) vehicle!

I agree with Stan. I'm no expert on Single Cabs but I've seen other low mileage VW's and they sure
didn't have all these problems. Sounds more like it had 126,000 miles on it. As far as the price
goes did you shop around to see what similar cars in that condition were going for before you agreed
on a price?

.....

'65 single cab with a claimed 26,000 miles.  Claimed to have been
restored
about ten years back.
----------------------------
I know I'm talking about a much newer bus but my 83 has over 300,000
miles on it and it doesn't have any of the problems you mention.
Even an old ragged 66 Westy I bought drives and runs very well.
This price would be right if it were ready to show at a competition
event.
I'm just hoping that you didn't really pay that much.
