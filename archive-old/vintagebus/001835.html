&gt; I need some wiper blades for my bus.

&gt;Can I get away with using bug ones?

Correct bus wiper blades are simply unobtainable here on the southern tip of
Darkest Afrika.

So I use Land Rover wiper blades, which are freely available. They are the
correct 11-inch size, but are to the modern wiper blade design, instead of
the flat squeegee design of the originals. They work really well and they're
cheap.

I don't suppose there are too many Land Rovers in the US, but maybe these
blades are available. If so, they're well worth a try.
