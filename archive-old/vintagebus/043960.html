This is in no way &quot;authoritative&quot;, but expressed on behalf of some years
of experience doin it my way.
Chassis/body components that I have fabricated/repaired, whether stock or
customized, have always been fastened to offer as much rigidity as
possible.  The reason??  Vibrations will start at one point and, over
time, will work their way along the part and cause problems beyond where
it begins.  That can be a pain in the butt.  It's one of the reasons I
have my son wash and detail his car himself.  So he can be aware of
something that comes loose as he's going over the whole car.
Body flex?  I wouldn't think it's something that was engineered into
Busses.
