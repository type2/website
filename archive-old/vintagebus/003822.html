From your description I would say you have several things wrong with
your steering system and possibly something wrong with the king pins
and link pins.

1. Check out your steering gear box. It may be set too tight. This
could be an indication that it is worn out and the PO set it tight to
try and compensate.

2. Check the swing arm bushing. It may be worn out causing slop.

3. Check the shims on the link pins. Wrong setting will cause squirley
steering

4. Maybe your king pin bushings are worn out also.

Whooeee. This sound worse than it may be. Good luck.
Others may be able to tell you more.

&gt; Howdy all,
&gt; I have only driven 2 split window buses ever, My current 66 and a 67
I was going to buy. Question: Do all vintage buses steer FUNKY? Both
of these did\do.  There is a quite a large &quot;dead zone&quot; for lack of a
better description between turning from one side to the other.  You
start to drift left, steer right to compensate and at first the
steering is a little hard and then all of a sudden it turns quick,
usually too much, resulting in over-compensation.  Also, the steering
is pretty &quot;hard&quot; once you pass this dead zone. Sometimes after a long
drive, my arms are actually physically tired from steering the bus.
So, is this common and what can I do to correct it??  I'd wave goodbye
to you all now, but my arms are a little rubbery from the drive in
this morning...
&gt;
&gt;
