When confronted with &quot;which direction does it go&quot; questions during a brake adjustment, I visualize  the screw top of a Thermos full of hot chocolate as the star adjuster. One direction makes the cap come out and the other direction makes it go on. Out = tighter brakes, in = looser brakes. Think of the adjuster turning, not where the screwdriver starts and ends. During the summer I visualize a cold Sierra Nevada Pale Ale bottle.
