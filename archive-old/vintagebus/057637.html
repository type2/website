 I just assumed that extra cable was a choke cable... I wasn't sure exactly
 when they did away with the manual choke.  I'll have to crawl under there
 and take a peek and see where that cable goes.

ya- reserve taps are very cool- helpful when you pull the motor too as you 
can shut the gas off.
.................
  The gas gauge is in german though...I think.  Its not English.
 -------------------
is your bus a german delivery model? no destination code?
......................
 My M-codes are U23 and 382.  Maybe 382 was for a gas gauge?  I can't find it
 anywhere...I thought maybe it was a &quot;package&quot; of m-codes as my bus has 6
 popouts, windshield washer setup, gas heater (probably dealer or westfalia
 installed), and probably a couple of other things.  I think U23 is the
 westfalia code as the bus is a SO-34 model.
  &gt;&gt;
ya- U23 does sound like a westy code.   I dunno what 382 is though.   
probably is a US spec package.   Maybe the U of U23 means the extras.  I only 
remeber A, B, C, D westys.  Anyone up on westy codes?  Neat thing about them 
is the westys often got a LOT of extra widgets

does the little light on the gas heater knob light up when you pull the knob 
out to turn the heater on?  that is so stylee.

do you have any pics of this bus on a web site?
