Subject: Re: [VB] re:speaking of oil

&gt; &gt;From Kevin Guarnotta:
&gt; Do our engines really run a lot hotter than a engine made today? I'm 
&gt; trying
&gt; to imagine these new cars with their 250+ HP engines running cooler then 
&gt; my
&gt; ~60 hp engine.
&gt; ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

&gt; Yes, they do. Modern engines rely on water to cool them. With a 180 or 195 
&gt; themostat, that is the temp range they run in....rarely over 200.
&gt; But an air cooled engine relies on air to cool them which is subject to 
&gt; ambient temperature changes.  On a hot day, the engine runs hot and so 
&gt; does the oil.
&gt;
My '87 16v GTI ran at 250F a lot during the AZ summer according to factory 
oil temp readout.  Temperatures in that range are not abnormal for a GTI. 
Water temp. was always within normal ranges.  I never had any trouble and I 
beat the crap out of that car.

&gt;Above 212 oil temp and the polymers in dino multi grade breakdown.
&gt;
From reading the flash point data on the link you posted:
http://www.repairfaq_dot_org/filipg/AUTO/F_oil_facts.html#OILFACTS_006

The flash point of Castrol 20w/50 (as an example) is 440F.

So assuming I understood everything correctly, unless you have a point on 
your engine where the oil is hitting 440F (maybe head temp?), the oil is not 
breaking down.  440F is a pretty high head temp.
