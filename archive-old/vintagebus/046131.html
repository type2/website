&lt;&lt;OOPS!  I feel so misunderstood!

The extensions I was referring to are the ones that go between the
wrench and the socket, not the &quot;cheater&quot; extensions that change the
length of the lever arm.  Placement of an extension between the wrench
and the socket does not change the torque at the socket if you are
careful to keep everything lined up and to apply force in a direction
perpendicular to the plane of the wrench and extension (in other
words, you need to support the end of the wrench that to which the
extension is attached).

George,
I'm no expert on this matter, I'm just quoting the instructions that came with
my wrench.  Yes, the wrench shows the length extension in the instructions. 
It also says &quot;Measure only distance that is parallel to torque wrench&quot;  Yes
you are correct, and I misread your post.

The 14&quot; torque wrench plus the 6&quot; extension add to the overall length of the
wrench and effect the torque.  

At any rate, the mechanic who was increasing the torque to compensate for loss
of torque by using extensions must be wrong.  If used properly, the extensions
perpendicular to the wrench will not effect the torque.  If used improperly
such as holding the wrench at an angle or not supporting the adapter, would
only increase the torque not lower it.

Torque wrench extensions are used most often to increase the torque beyond the
capacity of the wrench, or to increase the leverage to achieve the needed
amount of torque.


Here's the instructions if anyone is interested.

&quot;How adapters affect torque.&quot;

&quot;To understand why certain types of adapter and extensions change the amount
of torque delivered at the bolt head, it should be remembered that the amount
of torque produced on the bolt is the result of the amount of force applied
and the length of the torque wrench plus the length of the extension or
adapter.  Remember the torque law?  Force x distance = torque.  However, when
special accessories are used that add length to the torque wrench the setting
no longer reads true and corrections must be made to compensate for any added
length.  Adapters or extension may be used with a torque wrench for many
reasons.  

If an adapter is attached to the square drive of a torque wrench, the wrench
will not give the actual torque indicated by setting of the handle.  A simple
formula however, allows you to figure out what the setting should be to
deliver a predetermined amount of torque at the end of any adapter to the
fastener.&quot;

I previously posted the formula.
