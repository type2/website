Well I missed one VW auction to go check out &quot;THE BARN&quot;

The barn was at least 100 years old, the parts weren't.

What do you do when the pile is 6 feet deep and 20'x20'

Mostly engine and trannys, I would hate to think that sheet metal or glass
is underneath the heap.

HEARTBREAKER:
I found out that the gentleman who died had several &quot;NICE&quot; vws in a feed
barn in town.  WHO GOT THEM?  In Newman CA?  Somebody cleaned them out a few
days before, cannot seem find any details, just &quot;GONE&quot;

SO,  I do know where there is a barn full of engines and other mechanical
misc.   Also discovered that the area flooded a couple of years ago.   I may
go get it all, if it is free, still waiting for the final word on that!
Probably more scrap metal that good stuff.
anybody need a 36hp engine?

I did find a '55 deluxe recently, owners would rather let it sit and rot
than sell... ????
