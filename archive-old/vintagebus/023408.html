 &gt;  So remember if you bid
 &gt; $50.00 Maximum for a N.O.S.Oval speedo someone will bid $100.00 because
they
 &gt; want it more than you do. that's the American way.
 &gt; Thanks ,

 Yeah, but at the swap meet, no one walks up during the last seconds of a
 transaction and snatches it out of your hand then gives the guy a buck more.
 Right?

Steve, You are not getting the whole idea of what an Auction is. A swap meet
is a swap meet, an eBay auction is completely different in all respects. One
reason is you don't have near every VW fan in the entire world buying and
selling at the swap meet.You could have almost every world wide VW nut at eBay
buying and selling in a auction format. Ok think of it as a world wide swap
meet with different rules.
