Oh Brian!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Shouldn't have gone there..................

&quot;There are some of us out here in St. Louis, and various members of the &quot;Bus
Butts&quot; club that whole-heartedly believe in the theory that any AVAILABLE
woman who drives a Vw bus is clinically insane.&quot;

I think &quot;Clinically Insane&quot; is the wrong description here.  I think what he means is that all single women who drive busses are &quot;crazy&quot;.  Being insane myself, I think I know the difference. 

As a bus driver and single dude, I've often thought how cool it would be to link up with a woman who's hardcore enough to own a bus.  I've travelled many miles and met many people, and all I can say is that without exception every woman I've met so far that owns her own bus is nuts.  Some were wild, some were bizarre, all were interesting and I liked them all and respected their bus drivin' righteousness, but there was something a little left of reality going there.

Anyway, it's all a moot point anyway because guys who drive busses are &quot;geeks&quot;.  Some of us are probably even Trekkies.  Perhaps the female faction of our community isn't so crazy after all, they just aren't stupid enough to throw their lots in with guys who are too busy gettin spazzy over stamped bumpers and middle seats to know what real intimacy is all about.  And we're obsessive too, so much so that it takes a woman who can at least drive a bus and be conversant on them to fit the scheme of our mechanical passions.  Hence the reason why many of us are single, and frustrated too.  Those of you dudes lucky enough to find a bus driving gal who's craziness is compatable with yours, I envy you.

I bet some of y'all are sitting at the keyboards thinking &quot;Hey I'm not a geek &lt;ooh, the x-files is on!&gt;&quot;, but hey man, think about it.

So that's it.  Type 2 women are crazy, Type 2 men are geeks.  Busses and intimacy remains a tricky proposition at best, having two strikes against it to begin with.

On the other hand, women who drive Type 3's Rule the Earth!

To those of you out who aren't cynical enough to admit that VW's and intimacy are mutually exclusive, a piece of advice.
