 &quot;I agree w/Lou. It really does give you an empowering feeling to learn to do
things yourself.&quot;  Well Rex the trueth is you had painted your bus before me
and i used to 'save' all your pix and repoets so i could study them and many
times i'd say, &quot;hey, if he could, i could!&quot;.
 I bet that makes you feel good!  I've won four trophys this year and now
trophys are not important, driving and camping are my no. one priority.  My
wife and i made the 2K round trip to RMMW last month without a hitch, it was
our 32nd wedding anny.
  Keep on busing!
