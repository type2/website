Subject: Re: [VB] A.I.R.S. in VW trends

I've been called at work a few times from folks who got my name from the
AIRS list, mostly calling about parts or advice. I've helped rescue a
young couple making a long trip in a pretty sketchy bus, carrying few
tools and no spare parts... Guess what? I've been there before...

I've been working on VWs for a long time now. My bus is my ONLY driver.
I've had to call for help a few times myself. Nowadays I carry a big
toolbox, lots of spare parts, and a list of phone numbers, just in case.
My last breakdown on a long trip (broken camshaft, engine less than 10k
old) was more than I was prepared for on the side of the road, and I had
to ask for help. If you've ever been in this situation, you know how
grateful you felt to those who went out of their way to help you. I try
to repay my debt to the bus community every chance I get. Breaking down
is not necessarily a bad thing, either. I've learned a lot from my
experiences and have made some close friends, either by asking for help
or by offering it when asked.

Folks, we're driving antiques here, but we are all not mechanical gurus,
rich on parts or carrying well stocked toolboxes around. In fact, I
suspect many (if not MOST) of us started out driving old worn out buses,
blissfully ignorant and totally unprepared for what might happen on the
road.

If your bus is your Sunday driver, and you have time and money and
talent and knowledge and tools to get it back to the way it was when it
was new, and you carry a cell phone, a toolbox, a spare parts stash and
a backup plan on every short trip you make around town, then maybe you
don't really need the AIRS list.

Please, let's not turn the AIRS community into another snobby car club.
