Volks colleagues,

Happy day!  After two long Saturdays of working and a couple of consecutive
Saturday quickie calls to Old Volks of Ronnie, my son Bryan and I got the
axles installed and spinning on the rebuilt '67 tranny from Ronnie, of Old
Volks.  We had a problem with a stiff driverside axle but Ronnie just said to
put more &quot;spacer's&quot; in between the axle mount and the tranny.  &quot;Spacers.&quot;  New
name for paper gaskets, huh?  I remember the list talking about that a while
back.  Followed advice, three gaskets installed:  end of binding.

While My Sweet Bus was up on the jacks, we replaced the tired old shocks.  I
put in KGY gas shocks, KG5529 in the back.  Wow. really raised her and the
rear end lifts on standing normal take off.  We have KG4521's for the front
but havent installed them yet.  The rear wheels are really cambered in too.

Uh, is this a bad mistake?  Will it wear the tires and is it unsafe?
Fortunately we do have a '72 Westy that could use them, if we need to go back
to stock.  Our local flaps has stock shocks available. Opinions anyone?

Do you have any idea of the joy and feeling it is to get a bus back on the
road after breaking an axle, or whatever?  Yeah, I bet we all do.

Best,

Curt
