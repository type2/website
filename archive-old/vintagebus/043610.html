&gt;A collegue in the veterinary field has a dental unit that uses compressed
&gt;water to flush the teeth as they are cleaned. The reservior bottle has
&gt;sprung a leak and when she called the company, they reported that the bottle
&gt;used is from a late 60s bug! They report the bottle is NLA.

Rocky Mountain lists a '68-'78 Standard washer bottle, 113 955 453B, for
$36.  They also list a '71-'79 Super washer bottle, 135 955 453A, for $50.
Finally the replacement cap/valve 311 955 979B is $23.

Depending on where the leak is, you might try heat-welding (melting) it
back together, or possibly some epoxy--possible chemical concerns, though.
If you can salvage the neck of the bottle where the valve screws on, you
may be able to graft it on to another container.  I think originally
the valve was used to regulate the pressure in the bottle, and also
to shut off when the input pressure (from your spare) dropped below
some minimum, to keep you from getting a flat spare.  In this application
you probably don't have to worry about the shut off...if you can use 
a commercial low-pressure air regulator (air brush?) then you can probably
fabricate a substitute container, maybe even with greater capacity.

I hope this helps!
