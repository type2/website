Subject: heater excahnger tubing

I never did get any responses to my question so I will try again.  I was
wondering if anybody has those pod things in their tubing that goes from
the heat exchangers to the vehicle.  I also wondered if these contained
any asbestos or something else.  Lastly, what could I use instead of the
tubing.  I know that on my beetle I had a hard plastic tube that went
from the exchangers but I have since sold the beetle and I do not know
if it will fit. Suggestions?
