Hi list,

     Has anyone here ever put a quickshift in their bus or beetle?  How 
should I do it?  I ordered one from JC Whitney, but no instructions.  I 
should be able to figure it out, but I wanted to know if anyone has ever 
done it.  It would be going in a '65 beetle with a 67 and up shift lever 
(with out the little rod to keep the letter from spinning in the socket)

Thanks,
Matt
