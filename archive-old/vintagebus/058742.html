Subject: tranny feeling a little loose

My transaxle isn't in the best shape i know. When i changed my gear oil a 
broken washer fell out! My bus is a 67 deluxe with the orginal sing-axle 
tranny. My question is, i want to take the bus on a trip to floridy some 
time during june. I live in arkansas. it's going to be a long drive. what do 
I need to do to make my tranny reliable enough to get me down to the beach?
thanks
john
