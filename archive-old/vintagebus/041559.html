&gt; There is a similar thread on the 911 list right now, comparing the
&gt; aftermarket auto part industry to the aftermarket aircraft part
&gt; industry.
&gt; 
&gt; Basically, the auto aftermarket doesn't have to answer to anybody -
&gt; in a lot of cases, (from my own personal experience with a vendor
&gt; who makes some of the stuff discussed on this here list) not even the customer.
&gt; It's a whole different world inthe aircraft industry.  And conversely,
&gt; you don't have people asking &quot;Are XYZ's turbo bifurcators any good&quot; - you
&gt; know they are, or they wouldn't be sold.  I'm sure there are isolated
&gt; cases of failures, but nothing even close to the automotive world.
&gt; Then again, in most cases, when a car part fails, you don't die (most
&gt; cases, anyway...)
...

Two other results of the regulation of the aircraft aftermarket is that
the range of available parts is very limited and that the price you will
pay is many times what you would pay for the same part labeled
&quot;automobile&quot;

Personally, I don't want Big Brother telling me what I can buy and put
onto may car, then charging big time for the &quot;service&quot;.  After listening
to our european friends and their trials with their draconian regulatory
agencies I thank my lucky stars that I don't have to deal with
inspections.
