The &quot;abrasive&quot; bit was an attempt at humor...

Are you trying to strip the paint?  Feather it out?  If I knew your
objective, I could help with a recommended sanding grit.

* removing bondo - use a heat gun
* feathering for paint prep - 120 progressing to 220
* roughing up for body work - 40 or 60

&gt; scale work like this.
