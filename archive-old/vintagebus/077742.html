The pieces you want are called &quot;J&quot; tubes. They take the place of your
heater box completely. Many of the ads in HVW or VW Trends has them or
J.C. Whitney. I use them on dune buggies and trikes all the time where
heat is not a requirement.

Subject: [VB] exaust without heat exchangers?


hey all,

    i was wondering if it was possible to drive my bus around without
the heater boxes ( heat exchangers?) and still have an exaust system
hooked up. so could i? i really dont have the money to buy new ones, and
i would only be driving it around till i got a job and could buy new
ones. ( im only 16 ). thanks in advance,


p.s.
  my engine is a 1500cc. i plan to put a beetle exaust system on.
