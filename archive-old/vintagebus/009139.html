Subject: Reason for digital scale
Date: Tue, 14 Nov 2000 07:36:03 -0600

Me reason for wanting a digital scale is so that I can calculate ebay
package shipping accurately.  I was a bit amused by everyone who thought I
was needed to weigh up my stash or latest herbal remedy.  Good one! :-)

I found out that my little postal scale that Don Boneau picked up for me
last year in the middle of me trying to find a cheap scale to weigh my rods
on, works okay.  It goes up to 10 pounds and for most packages, this is
okay.  It actually appears to be cheaper to buy a couple more Royal postal
scales for larger packages and then add up the weight between scales instead
of buying one large one.  I did find a used digital meat scale for $85 and
that's pretty darn cheap.  It's from a folded up meat packing place about
1000 miles from me though. :-(
