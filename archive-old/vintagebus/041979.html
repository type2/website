No VWs I know of, but they did build one from a Ford Pinto.  Had to have a
fairly hefty engine to get the weight of the Pinto off the ground (the
Pinto engine was not used in flight).  From what I understand, the project
ended when the Pinto detached from the wing in flight:

(from http://www.hartfordadvocate_dot_com/articles/skycar.html)

In the 1950s and '60s, Leland Bryan produced a series of
highway-certified folding-wing
&quot;roadables&quot; that used their
pusher propellers for both air and
road power. The project
ended when Bryan died in the crash
of one in 1974. And in
1973, Henry Smolinski fastened the
wings, tail and aft engine
of a twin-engine Cessna Skymaster to
one ill-fated Ford Pinto.
The wing struts collapsed on its
first test flight, killing Smolinski
and the pilot.


Ouch.
