That's right! A post about *buses*!  I'll probably get flamed for this one.
 Doubt I'll get kicked off the list though...

Anyway, I updated the rare bus page, and some more cool pix that you
probably won't see anywhere else... well, until someone macks them and uses
them on their page.  Imitation is the most sincere form of flattery!

There's pix of a funky isetta-esque bus with a *front* door, and that
far-out Australian vent option (M-Code anyone?)

For once I'm glad I *wasn't* driving my bus: I got rear-ended on the way
home from work yesterday in the 911.  The nice 5mph bumper soaked it right
up - it probably would have wiped out the entire back end of the bus.
