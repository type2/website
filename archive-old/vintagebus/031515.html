Subject: Re: [T2] Re: [VB] importing goods to USA

Hi Everett
I had others ask too, What paper work is required?
A title, a sales receipt, anything else? 

Lets say I was transporting YOUR car to YOUR state,, Can I pay the tax / duty
for you?

&gt; They were probably asking for my benefit, that's pretty cool...
&gt; 
&gt; I called the USA border office today in Buffalo, NY and they said there is
&gt; no problem bringing across any car over 25 years old, you just have to pay a
&gt; duty fee of 4% of the first $1000, 2% of the next $1000, etc..  I stopped
&gt; listening after the 4% because no VW would cost more than $1000, that would
&gt; be just crazy, right?
