Subject: My 1776 re-rebuild and 1.25 rockers.

This morning I decided to try my ratio rockers on my engine.  Of course now
that the heads are spaced off the cylinders, it actually created the spacing
I needed to squeeze in the ratio rockers AND the bugpack swivel feet
adjusters.  I also had to use 2 thick shims to get the geometry a little
closer to correct.  With the big ports on these heads, you can really see
the geometry of the valve action much better.  I've got my lash caps on the
stems as well and even with all the stuff crammed in, the geometry is just a
hair on the big side meaning the rockers are pushed out just a bit further
than I would like but I'm confident that the lash caps and swivel feet will
slide across the valve stem surface a lot better than if I had used a stock
adjuster.

The only other way I could see to stand a chance at getting the geometry any
closer to spec would be to actually lengthen the pushrods and space the
rocker shaft out so far, I wouldn't have any threads to secure the rocker
shaft with.  These rocker shaft studs are already 1/2&quot; longer than stock.

There's a lot to be said for buying a good set of heads.  I'll never get
those damn rebuilt units again.  It's either brand new stock or brand new
after market from this point on whenever possible.
