   I am going to the Michigan show this weekend. I am going to leave
Saturday morning from the Pittsburgh area and plan to be camped out at
the Pontiac lake rec. area by late afternoon. If anyone wants to hook up
somewhere on the road let me know. If you see me be sure to introduce
yourselves, I will be driving a red (fresh paint)and white (old paint)
splitty with a full roof rack and half of a westy interior in it. I
understand if you don't want to travel with the guy who won the, &quot;I
can't belive you drove that thing all the way here!&quot; honors at Everybus
in North Carolina.
Hope to see you there!

P.S. my bus is actually roadworthy now I lose little to no oil between
gas fillups. (Amazing how much oil will come out of a hole in a push-rod
tube, ain't it?)

god bless

I got a beat-up VW bus for my girl-friend. It was a very good trade!!!
