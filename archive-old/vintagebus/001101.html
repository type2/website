Tks for all input.

Just befor i asked i tried to find any Baywindows picture to compare with
lots of split seat picture on Vintagebus and VWplanet, but didnt find any !
huu...

Well Im gonna see one guy who will is supposed to have a split rear seat,
and the middle he didnt have any so thats why he proposed me the bay and
told me it was the same, but ill bring picture captured from internet to
compare... anyway hes selling 50 $ each (Canadian he he), its not like
paying 500$ for a seat that u dont use or are disapointed after all!!

Thks again All!!
