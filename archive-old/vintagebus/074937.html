Subject: RE: [VB] looking for heater tubes

  I have black accordian (insulated) style heater tubes that eleiminate the
metal muffler boxes. We have these in 60mm to 50 mm and also 60 mm to 60 mm.
These go directly from the heater box to the body. Also by special order
50mm to 50 mm for those running early heater boxes.

Subject: [VB] looking for heater tubes


so does anyone have 2 heater tubes (60mm size that connect exchangers
to body) around? I haven't found any at the past few swaps and it's
starting to get a bit chilly. Wolfsburgwest carries them, but they
have been out of stock for a long time. TIA
