I need the indoor space that this bus is taking up. This bus needs a
complete restore or is an excellent parts vehicle. Not titled at present but
can get the title easy enough. Engine is not in it, has a bad head but have
an extra head for it. Some rust, but nothing that cant be fixed easy enough.
I just have too many projects and my indoor space is too jammed with them.
Asking $800 but negotiable. Can email pictures to interested parties.
Located in Murray, Ky, might be able to deliver south to Florida or west
through MO or Kansas.
