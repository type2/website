Just started screwing around with the taillights on the 67 poptop and i 
noticed that the right one is much brighter than the left.  It seems to be 
blowing fuses too.  Now i tried checking the wiring at the light to see if 
any were on wrong or if there were any bad grounds but everything checks out 
OK.  Checked the wiring to and at the box and everything seemed fine.  The 
fuse for the taillights is the one that keeps blowing.  The taillights stay 
on with the right one brighter and when you push the brake a few time...POP 
goes the damn fuse!  any suggestions?  I am soooo lost
