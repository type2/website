&gt; I'd prolly try setting the battery on the opposite side, to stop the drip.
&gt; Then clean up the mess around the hole with water, and then isopropyl
&gt; alcohol, then rough up the plastic around the hole with fine sandpaper,
&gt; clean that off, and then either:
&gt; 
&gt; use some good epoxy glue over the whole roughed up area, or
&gt; 
&gt; find a good patching material, such as thin neoprene sheet, cut a one
&gt; inch square, rough it up on one surface, and apply a good quality contact
&gt; cement to the roughed up battery surface and the roughed up side of the
&gt; sheet material, wait 15 minutes, and patch it. Let it dry for a full day
&gt; before setting the battery down again. And clean up the spillage that has
&gt; already occured in the bus, or it'll rust up quickly.
