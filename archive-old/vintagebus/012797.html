Good catch! I wonder if this is it?

19 windows certainly are not common.   Anyone have the numbers
&gt;from the other bus and is lcose enough to follow it up?

I remember there was one other bus that was stolen and recovered,
but new numbers had been sectioned in; anyone ever find out what
happened after that?
