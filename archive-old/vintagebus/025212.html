Last week the 67 got rear-ended by a taxi while the bus
was parked up, luckily outside the garage where it was
booked in for some tinkering. It's not a pretty sight
though it's repairable. The main impact was on the rear
offside (nearside to most of you) and the crumpling
extends forward to the vents. The rear quarter panel
has sheared off along the battery tray which maybe has
saved more damage being propagated forward. It's
especially a pain in the $%^&amp; as we're supposed to be
driving it down to the South of France in less than 4
weeks time.
