Subject: Ronnie's trip
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

To anybody who's interested, here is a picture of what Ronnie got in the 
midwest.  He just stopped here a while ago, to rest up and shower, before the 
rest of his trip to Lake Havasu.  He said I'd never forgive him if he didn't 
stop by, because I always stop in Havasu!

I'd never seen a barndoor ambulance fan before!
