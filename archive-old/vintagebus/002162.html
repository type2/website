well being that my single is a 57 the plate doesn't tell me the m- codes
which is all I really want to know, and I quoted the letter right from
Wolfsburg which does in fact state to write the vin on the bill...maybe it
was a bad English translation on their part but that is what it said.

&gt;&gt; number written DIRECTLY on the front of the bill. I was told 10DM is
about
&gt;&gt; 20 bucks but I'm not sure.....
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Ohh PLEASE!
&gt;
&gt;Look in your newspaper. Currently its about 1.84DM per Dollar, so its
&gt;about $6.
&gt;And don't write on the bill.
&gt;
&gt;Some people seem to expect all kind of secret information to come out of
&gt;this correspondence.
&gt;Especially for the US cars this is not so. The body ID plate will tell
&gt;you more than VW can in most instances.
&gt;Its more interesting for cars that went to exotic countries, but those
&gt;usually never made it to the US (the ID plate tells you if it went to
&gt;the US dirctly).
&gt;
&gt;I once bought an unusually rustfree Bug in Germany, that had funny
&gt;velvetlike original seatcovers and strange electrics (ignition wired to
&gt;the taillights). It turned out to have been delivered to Iran.
&gt;
&gt;I think it only makes sense to write to Wolfsburg if there is something
&gt;suspicious about your car, like it being 10 inches longer than it should
&gt;be.
