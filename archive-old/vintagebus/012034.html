The truck is in fair overall shape. It is definitely worth restoring since it
is fairly complete and straight. There are no cuts out of the body, rear wheel
arches are intact. Bed is solid and gates are 90% rust free.   Someone years
ago must have done a fix up job on it, since you can tell there has been metal
put in the floor and the rockers have been fixed before also, and rust in
coming back in both places, and they changed the color from green/turquoise to
yellow/tan.  You will definetly need to do some welding on this truck, as most
of the outer floor supports that tie into the rockers need to be replaced.  All
of the windows are out of it thanks to vandals.  I have decent used glass for
most of the windows that goes with the truck.
There is no gas tank, and there is a basketball diameter size dent in the front
where the emblem goes if it had one, although the dent isn't deep. It has what
appears to be its original engine, but it has not been started for a long time.
  I am asking $900 since I compared it to one that just sold in KC for $1000
without an engine and it had been cut up extensively, and would be very
difficult to put back to original. Located near Kansas City. Have pictures that
I can e-mail if interested. Do not check e-mail on weekends. Jim.
