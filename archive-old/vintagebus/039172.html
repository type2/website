The major sticking point is where to install the radiator on a vehicle
that 
was never designed to use one.  The most logical place -- and the surest
path 
to success -- is to put the radiator on the front of the vehicle, using
any 
of a number of proven techniques to provide the necessary plumbing.
Indeed, 
the Vanagon provides an excellent engineering model as how best to
install 
the pipes, hoses and radiator.

Reading Bob Hoover's discussion of the Subaru engine swap reminded me of
a 68ish baywindow bus that I saw a while back that had been fitted with
an 1800 cc in line four cylinder watercooled(obviously) Toyota engine.

The owner got around cutting up the body of his very original looking
bus by fitting a pair of radiators in 'series' below the cab floor and
just behind the nose skin lip. To direct airflow to the radiators he
used rubberised conveyor belting to make a full width scoop that
extended about 150mm below the  the front bumper. The scoop was
internally split and formed into two channels that fit snuggly onto the
radiators so that all airflow was directed at the radiators. 

BTW only one radiator had a thermostat controlleded fan fitted and the
owner said that it only ran when he was in stop and go traffic. 

The radiators were from a tiny 1400cc Nissan mini truck that we get here
in South Africa. They are very small(about 300 x 200mm overall)so they
were able to be mounted very nearly vertically below the cab floor. Both
rads were protected from scooped up stones and other road hazards by
expanded metal screens which had obviously been smacked a few times as
they were both pretty distorted. 

The scoop arrangement seemed to work, he said it hadn't had any
overheating problems in the two years that he'd had it running, and it
didn't detract too much from the looks of the vehicle due to the fact
that the radiator(s) were completely hidden. The scoop itself was
certainly visible but not nearly as ugly as a nose mounted radiator.
Because the scoop was monted below and slightly behind the front bumper
it was actually quite easy to miss. The fact that it was made of a
flexible and durable material also meant that it could absorb hits by
traffic humps and the like. 

I lived in an apartment a while back where one of the tennants was
running a mid 70's beetle with a similar setup. He had the same sort of
rubber scoop directing air at a single radiator mounted in the spare
wheel well. He cut the bottom out of the well and then sealed the well
off from the trunk with a bulkhead that fitted against the lid when it
was closed. He had an Oettinger modified 2200cc Rabbit(we call them Golf
1's here) engine in this beast which he intended turbocharging when
funds allowed. This was driven ridiculously fast and didn't seem to
suffer any sort of overheating problems. It was reliable enough for it
to be his daily driver for the year or so that I lived in the same
building.

I have seen two split window buses fitted with nose mounted radiators
and IMHO they were so ugly that they weren't worth the effort. 

There are a couple of companies here that specialise in doing engine
conversions to bay windows. In these conversions they fit the radiator
into a fabricated housing in the double skinned nose. This housing
extends just a few centimetres into the cab are and because they are
centrally mounted they don't get in the way much. This doesn't work well
in splitties though 'cause there is much less cab. 

Please keep us updated on your progress with the Subaru swap Bob.

Later

Michael of the bloody pretty '61 doublecab.
