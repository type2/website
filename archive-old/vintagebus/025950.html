&gt; ....the main prob with the inserts is the edge of the whitewall starts to
&gt; dig
&gt; VERY deeply into the sidewalls of your tires after a while which can mean
&gt; danger. Also they are known to rip..  ...Best to fork out the cash and go to
&gt;
&gt; COKER tire or someplace and get the real deal, OR i know of a guy in cali
&gt; who will take your tires and cut the whitewall into them and paint them,
&gt; thus, turning it into a real whitewall....

I sell whitewall inserts, so I'm biased here. But if the correct insert size
is used (not too big for the tire) and is properly installed they will last.
I've been running a set on my T34 Ghia for over a year now with no problems.
Installation is quite simple, when the tire is broke away from the rim the
insert slips in between the tire and rim. A little soapy water helps the the
tire slip on the insert, correct installation method, instead of catching on
it and pushing it out creating an incorrect installation.

I run inserts on all my cars that have low profile tires due to the lack of
low profile whitewall tires. But on my cars with &quot;stock&quot; sized tires I run
&quot;real&quot; whitewalls, and I agree that if you have that option available you
should use it. I sell real whitewall tires too just for that reason. Some from
Coker some from other tire mfg.'s. I can say that I have NEVER had deep cuts
in the side of my tires. Maybe a little wear mark from the edge of the insert.
If what wade says about a cut from the edge being a big danger I can only
imagine what danger would come from someone actually cutting a large w i d e
groove in the sidewall to give the appearance of a whitewall. Also a painted
on whitewall doesn't last too long either.....been there, done that.

Just wanted to give some input from some who has experience with inserts and
uses them................
