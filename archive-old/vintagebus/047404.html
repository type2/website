     Just put all brand new rubber on all windows.....when I got the the 
 driver and passenger side Went through everything and made sure windows 
still 
 slid in channel...but when I put them back in the bus and put everything 
 together...windows are extremely tight in channels and hard to open and 
 close...any suggestions on how to remedy this tightness?  TIA, Chris

WW rubber?   Story is ....leave them closed and wait a year.   That is the 
way it is unless you can find NOS rubber.  Be very careful if you have 
laminated glass.
