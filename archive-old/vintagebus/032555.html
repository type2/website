i don't have a new engine, but it was new 7 years ago when i built it.  i
trust this motor more than any other i drive, and would not hestiate to
drive it anywhere in a moment's notice, and have often done that--like
driven to eastern connectcut down to eastern pa, then back up to conn the
same day-about 10 hrs total driving. just make sure your engine is
mantained and all critical factors (end play, compression, valve
adjustment, tune-up things) are within vw factory specs and up to date.  of
course, there is never any guarantee of trouble free travels.  just be
prepared in case you break down, too.

&gt;     Does every one who goes anywhere have a new engine.  I noticed that
&gt; Ronnie in Prescott had a new engine in the wife's car.  JP in Co has one
in
&gt; his Westy (where did your Havasu trannie go?)  Hell I am getting ready to
&gt; drive 1800 miles in the engine that came with the truck that I bought last
&gt; Fall.  Am I supposed to be worried or something?
