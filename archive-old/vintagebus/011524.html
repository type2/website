Subject: Free To Good Home(s)

Brave souls:

I have two splits looking for a good home and someone with the
energy to put them back on the road.  I have had several guys
stop by out of the blue, asking if they're for sale.  First I
said $400 for the pair then I said $200 for the pair.  Both guys
said they'd be back after talking with the SO.  You know the rest
of that story.  So...I'm looking for takers here in northern
Illinois or southern Wisconsin (or anywhere else for that
matter).

I'M NOT LOOKING TO SELL PARTS, just clean up the barnyard a bit.
Here's some details:

1)  1966 21-window Deluxe:  Sat as a lawn ornament for 15 years.
I got a call that the city was widening the road and I hauled it
home to save it from the crusher.  The sunroof is gone and the
interior is shot.  Everything I pulled off of it went in a box in
the barn and will go with it.  It is up on wheels, but the right
reduction box is shot.  Rust in all the usual places but it's
structurally sound enough that I couldn't bring myself to cut it
up.  Someone pulled the pop-out windows and installed jalousy
windows years ago.  I have Illinois title in my name.

2)  1967 Walk-thru Westfalia Pop-Top:  That description gives it
more credit than it's due.  Original interior is gone;  pieces of
later interior were stuck in randomly.  Several previous owners
ago someone put a bench seat up front and hacked at the
bulkheads.  Rust in the usual places but structurally sound
enough that it's savable.  On this one, someone pulled the
jalousy windows and put in fixed glass.  Title is from Florida,
signed by last owner.

I would consider both of these &quot;rolling shells&quot; but I would
highly recommend a trailer instead of towing them.  Neither has
an engine, but I'll (literally) throw in one or two of those I
have sitting around in various states of assembly or disassembly.
I'm not looking to make any money on this deal, just to find a
good home (or two).  I have some spare parts I can add to the
deal if necessary but I really hate being taken for a chump.

With five other VW projects of my own, I have more than enough to
keep me busy.  If you're the right kind of person and you're
looking for a freebee, my surplus can be your lucky day.

Please contact me offlist.  You can write about the road trip
onlist later...
