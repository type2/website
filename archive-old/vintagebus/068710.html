Subject: Re: [VB] new bus questions

&gt; wazzup bus peeps

hola el dawgito

&gt;
&gt; i got some questions about my new bus. i gots it last week from a junkyard in town.the homie at the yards says itsa 61 but im not sure. i looked by the windshield but cant find the vin number like my moms car.i wanna know how to lower it. i saw a sick bus yeasterday and man that bus was slammed!  i want to put some bags on it.

vin should be on a tag on the overhead vent and another on the seat
pedastal. also it should be stamped in the frame in the back.

&gt; my bro down the street has a moter hes gonna sell to me.says its a 1640 and will work perfect. its alredy got all the crome metal and pipes.is this a bus motor?

Slam it, get some hydraulics and neon and send us all pictures.

&gt; i live close to la and want to know where to get parts and rims for it.  it runs right now but runs real bad and its real slow.how do find out what year it is?

Your in the best place for it. check the phone book, magazines and ask
locals.

&gt; later homies

Likewise..
