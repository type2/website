But is the international thing good for US citizens and other socialistic 
European governments?

Personally I try to have as many &quot;Made in USA&quot; parts on my VW as possible 
and if not US then another reputable country like Germany, England, Canada, 
and so forth.

NAFTA and a joke for the WTO will be the death of the US manufacturing 
base...  Unless you strive to be the old person greeter at Wal-Mart?


Since this is low on VW content and I would get administer lashings on the 
Type2 list, here is some good stuff:

I traded some parts this weekend to get a very nice totally restored German 
019 distributor.  Sweeeeeeet!!!  (Easterwood will want to shoot me if I tell 
him one more time ;) LOL)  Driving notes to come later versus a German 
009.... Needless to say it was a real PITA to find one.

Take Care,
Adrian
