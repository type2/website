Subject: Re: [VB] Highway Speeds

My  guess is you're overrevving and should slow it down.

It's not so much road speed as engine RMPs.   What rpms is 70?   Borrow a 
tach and hook it up temporarily just to find out what 2K, 3K  and 3500rpms is 
in each gear.  VW recommends 3500rpms as max and cruising speed.  Even though 
it's possible to push it faster, it's not a good idea.  Using 3K as top 
cruising speed extends the life of your motor.  Some folks have put in higher 
geared trannys to get higher road speeds without winding the piss out of the 
engine, and so get better milage, a cooler motor, and a quieter ride.    
(best cooling is about 2600 to 2800 rpms- your engine runs warmer at revs 
higher and lower than that)  

The truck I had got about 48mph at 3K.   My 61 has the stylee early 64 
gearing, and gets 60mph at 3K rpms.  You may, or may not, have a 67 tranny in 
a 67 bus, cause it could have been replaced.  It could have a bug fourth 
(lower geared).
67s had a bus 4th (same 4th as all buses) but had a 4.12 r/p with the 1.26 
big nut boxes and 14&quot; wheels.  mid 64 to 66s had 4.38 with 1.26rg, &amp; 14&quot;s.  
early 64s had 4.38 r&amp;p, 1.26RG, 15&quot;wheels, which is a great gearing set up.

 lucky for you, you've got a '67. That was a good year
 for trannys, with a &quot;taller&quot; 4th gear. I'm not sure if
 they introduced it in '66 or '67, but us folks with
 older busses have to be satisfied with driving 55,
 with occasional spurts up to 60 on the down-hills. I
 used to have a '66 with a stock '67 tranny in it, and
 got it up to 75 on occasion. (with a 1300 dual port
 industrial motor in it!) It was a bit shaky at that
 speed though. I'd reccomend cruising at 65, with
 occasional spurts up to 70....just to keep your tranny
 and motor happy. Also, I just don't feel safe with
 stock bus brakes going faster than 65...
