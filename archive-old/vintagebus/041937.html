&gt; Hi All
&gt; I just spent 2 weeks in Mexico for La Carrera Panamerica.  The gas in all of
&gt; mexico is availiable in 87 and 92 octane grades.  Several of the race cars
&gt; ran the 87 all race with no problems.  The fuel we had to siphon out of our
&gt; car to feed other's cars always looked very clean with no gunk at all.  Plus
&gt; all the stations are full serve!  Make sure, however you fill up at every
&gt; station you see, you don't know when the next one will come along.  Also,
&gt; none of the pemex attendants took plastic--pesos only

I'm glad someone pointed out how &quot;normal&quot; Mexican gasoline is.  The days
of buying gas out of 55-gallon drums behind a pharmacia and filtering it
through a chamois are pretty much
gone, especially if you are fairly close to the beaten path.  In 25 years
of driving gasoline and diesel-powered vehicles south of the border I've
never had a fuel-related failure.

The big difference is the non-competitive nature of the mexican gasoline
monopoly (PEMEX).  This means that stations are not as plentiful as they
are here in the US, so if you get out into rural areas (such as Yucatan)
it pays to enquire as to where the next gas station is.

Most important advice for travelling in mexico:  Don't do anything you
wouldn't do in the US.  Most of the people who get themeselves in trouble
in mexico do so by acting like idiots.
