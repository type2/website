&gt; This sucks!!  I went to California DMV to get my tags for my 63 kombi.  Well,
&gt; they gave me new plates!  They said that only vehicles 1962 and older can use
&gt; the old plates even if those plates were the orginal plates.  I have the old
&gt; black and gold plates.  I call my local Senator office to complain about it.
&gt; They were going to look into it.  It is state law.  And I want to change it!
&gt; So, beware if you have the old plates and you want tags for them in
&gt; California.  They will give you new ones....Don't give them the old ones!!!!!
&gt;  If anyone knows a way around this let me know.

There is a special code that has to be used to keep these plates (63-71 black and
gold). I sold a guy a car (64 Squareback) that had OG plates on it. He had it
registered was given new plates then AFTER THE FACT he went back in with the OG
plates (don't let them take yours, if they want to tell 'em NO!) and had them put
on the car......very nice. Sometimes you have to call the BIG DMV office in
Sacramento to set your local office straight.

Before I get bombarded with requests, I'll say that I will find the number and
post it to the list.
