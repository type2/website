Yesterday I discovered the Westy's speedometer was pretty beat up.  All the
colored stuff (turn signal, gen &amp; oil) is either missing, falling out, or
badly discolored, and the plastic socket for the gen light is broken.  I'm
going to try replacing the socket since it looks like it's just screwed in.  
While I'm there with the speedo out, though, I'd really like to replace the
colored plastic bits.  Is there an easy way to get something that'll work or
do I have to hunt?  If I have to hunt, where should I start?

I know this has been discussed before, but I couldn't find anything in the 
archives.  Thanks for any help!
