Hi,
The problem with this method is that you more often than not ruin a perfectly 
good steering column by mashing the threads, and the tube that makes up the 
shaft.  If you have to use a hammer use it with a piece of 2x4 laid flat 
under the arm of the steering wheel and pound up with the hammer.  Moving 
often the wood, and hammer from arm to arm.  The biggest problem why the 
steering column stick to the steering wheel is that they are machined with a 
taper fit that practicly glues them together.  Eric&amp;Barb
