     Killer time at BYOB and Kelly park eh, need some signs for the swap 
 though! I was talking to Ronnie on sunday about gas heaters and he mentioned 
 of someone in colorado who remanufactures and sells them. Does any one out 
 there know of this and if so could provide me with a way to contact them? 
=============
I agree with you 100%.  But I have 2 non working BN-4s, and was tinkering 
with them to try and figure out how to make one work, then was given a third 
that had been in a friends barn for 15 years!   Hopefully I can make a 
working one.  I did get the KC Kombis video, it was really good.  If you feel 
like the DIY thing.  Then I shelved the idea and decided to make the bus 
roadworthy and drive to California for Red Barn/Kelley Park.

Also is it possible to surmount a 
 12V wiper motor in a 63', love to hear stories of good idea, bad idea, 
 thanks guys and gals I'll talk to you later.

In my 61 I just have a voltage drop, works fine for me.  JP put a sort of 
switch in his bus that means he gets 3 speeds from his 6V wiper motor in his 
12V bus, pretty cool idea.  I would do that if I could use the original style 
knob.  If you want to put the 67 wiper motor in your bus, you would have to 
mash the heater defrost conduits in.  Myself I couldn't do that.  the 66 and 
67 motors are the same shape, both take the same frame, only the voltage was 
changed, so it would be easy to put the 12V deal in a 66.
