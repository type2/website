Barndoors have similar VIN plates in the engine compartment, but don't
have the &quot;coded&quot; VIN like later buses.  If it's a barndoor, it
will have a 20-###### VIN, I can't recall the last barndoor VIN.  The
early wolfsburg buses had 20-###### numbers as well, until they moved
the whole operation to Hannover, and they changed to the ###### (without
the 20-)

The number will also be stamped in the body below the VIN plate.  THe
number behind the front passenger seat is meaningless.

Take pen and paper, write all the stuff down, then report back to the list.

&gt; where are they? The bus in question is apparently way in the back of a shed
&gt; and is filled/surrounded with junk and I will have less than an hour to
&gt; check it out.
