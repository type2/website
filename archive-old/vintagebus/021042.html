Subject: Re: [VB] removing gen brushes I need help



&gt; 
&gt; Brushes on the gen while in the bus are a pain in the arse. Remeber they are 
&gt; on the top and the bottom. I have had brushes that werent made very well and 
&gt; were too thick to drop down as the spring pushed on them.

After the third set in six months (bad commutator) I got pretty adept at it.  A mirror and a stubby screwdriver (that _fits_ the screw) is very 
helpful.  taping the screw to the screwdriver makes it easier to put back in.

Of course, I converted to an alternator, so my hard-won skill is for naught.

&gt; The way I delt with it was this:
&gt; I bought a guaranteed generator. Some of you wont like that plan and its 
&gt; understandable, the FLAPS sell these as remanufactured units, and what that 
&gt; means, is that some electronics student from Arizona or whereever rebuilt 

Problem is, the time it takes to remove and replace a generator is worth more than the value of that &quot;free&quot; generator.  I'd rather put in a 
good unit once than a series of poorly-rebuilt units.

&gt; However, and its a big however, is that I dont replace brushes. Ever. I 
&gt; replace the whole unit when it doesnt work. I always take the brushes out 
&gt; when I return the gen, and now I have a small pile of them. They are spares.

Gee, brushes cost $7 a set.  Why keep half-worn-out ones around?

&gt; I figure that yes it is annoying to take out the gen and return it, but hey 
&gt; I would have to take it out anyway to put in them brushes.
&gt; 
&gt; I have replaced brushes using a mirror on other folks busses but its such a 
&gt; pain in the arse I dont do it on my Bus. (or the 7 or 8 busses I have 
&gt; owned).
&gt; 
&gt; One time purchase = lifetime bus fun, no matter how many you own.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; BTW: After 7 lifetime starters (different concept bear with me) they are 
&gt; getting annoyed at my returns, but in the end if they wont replace it they 
&gt; will give me my money back. Heh.

I've had one starter in my bus the entire time I've owned it.  Same goes for my wife's bug.  Both have a &quot;Bosch Remanufactured&quot; label. 
Thank goodness the PO of both vehicles went for the good stuff.  Again, it's better to pay once for quality than return a succession of 
&quot;lifetime guaranteed&quot; units.
