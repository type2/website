Hi AJ,
We have been Fallon NV several times!
Best to just take the engine apart and rebuild it now and vastly reduce 
ruining the original engine case and leaving you stranded with a dead engine. 
 When you move it the 20 miles to your home us a trailer if possible.  If not 
inspect the front wheel bearings and repack them with new grease.  Drain and 
refill the tranny and RGBs and keep an eye for any leaks!  Get new tires on 
it.
   Recently a friend of our sold a low, low mileage straight rust free late 
50s panel with the original from the factory with old age cracks in them bias 
ply tires.  The fellow was warned to get new tires before towing it and the 
new owner said he would be trailering it.  While our friend was away from 
home the new owner showed up and dollyed the panel away without changing any 
of the tires.  One of rear tires blew out and the bus flipped three times at 
highway speed into a 
ditch....................................................   
  Thus as we have said over and over, if the tires do not roll, steer, or 
stop properly it should not be driven!  Engine work and concerns should come 
secondary to any one of these problems.    Eric&amp;Barb
