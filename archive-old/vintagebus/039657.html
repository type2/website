I've gotten to the point where I need to order some seat covers for my 67 
deluxe.  I'm going original, so I've located the color code for it on my 
plate.  The color line reads 38-13-70.  70, of course, signifies mesh 
platinum, right?  WELL, after stripping THREE layers of aftermarket 
upholstery I finally hit the orignal color.  The thing is, the 'original' 
color looks like mesh gray instead.  Seems a bit contradictory?  I've 
included a picture with my post as well as two color patches from the 
Wolfsburg West interior color section.  Does anyone have some insight on 
this?
Thanks,
-Wes
