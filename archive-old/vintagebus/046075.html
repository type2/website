Hi everyone,
   I need a small section of a truck bed to use as a template to straighten 
my bed out.  Its a 57 single in overall good shape (now that most of the 
bodywork is 
done!) but the bed has just has a few bad spots that need to be evened
out. Its been beadblasted and zinc coated and there was no rust really to 
start with, just the usual rot under the gates (which is a whole other matter 
). I am going to remove the lower panels, so getting at the bed from below 
will be easy. So removing the lower section will be my next project.   But in 
the meantime I need to find a couple of solid 2ft by 2ft section (approx) 
does not need to be pretty just straight. Can anyone help me out?  
Has anyone tried this?
