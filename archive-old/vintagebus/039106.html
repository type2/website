I had a hard time trying to get the front floor for my 65 DC. The only place
you will be able to get the piece you need is from a donor. Even then, many
people wont cut it out for you cause its a real pain to get one out without
thrashing it. For my car I found a list member (Ton Mink) who took pitty on
me and hacked the floor out of a single cab for me(Tom, the floor looks
great!). He even shipped it here, the kind soul he is! Keep your eyes peeled
on all the sites and lists for wrecked or junked busses. Lots of busses have
the part you need cause its usualy the ends near the dog legs that rot away.
The PO of my DC used a metal trash can and wood screwes to make a floor.
Looked nice, but im a real stickler for stock :) Good luck!

I'm not sure if parts needed is acceptable on the list, but I really need a

front floor section for my 64 bus.

I'm not looking for the reproduction side panels by the doors (though mine

are gone). I need the WHOLE front floor.

I have nothing to bolt the shifter to, or anything like that. Does anyone

know of a source that either sells a replacement panel or a good used one?

sorry, cant help.   I cut a large piece of a junked bus to get a replacement

front floor for my 61 w/ OE safaris and thus swiss cheese front floor.

BTW, the shifter does not bolt to the floor on a 64, but to  piece under
the 
floor, through the floor.
