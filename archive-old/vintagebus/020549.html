&gt; OK, enough of the Japan bashing, 

I dont think anyone was?

first of all they
&gt; DO USE them like us, look
&gt; at the pics of a Japan camp-out on Thom's and/or
&gt; Everetts site. What would
&gt; of happened if the Germans decided to export to
&gt; Japan and not the U S, we
&gt; would all be buying our buses from Japan and they
&gt; probally would be saying
&gt; the same thing about us.

Not all of us, most of us cant afford them now, and
that doesnt count the importing fee.


 At least the people from
&gt; Japan are buying the buses
&gt; MOST of us couldn't afford anyway and helping to
&gt; fire up the market to help
&gt; sell buses. 

Last thing I needed was the market fired up. I for one
don't get a kick out of the &quot;everyone wants one&quot;
thing. But I am not in the business, its just a hobby
of mine.

Now if I was worried about buses going
&gt; overseas, I would be
&gt; bashing the ENGLISH, they buy up all the parts and
&gt; buses we can afford and
&gt; ship them to England!!!!! really inflating the
&gt; market on POS buses and parts
&gt; which in turn goes down the gauntlet and affects all
&gt; of us more then a
&gt; Japanese purchase ever would.

So your saying that it doesnt matter who ships them
out fo the country, but the the Brits are the only
ones driving the cost up?????
