Sorry, I couldn't resist purloining this from another list I'm on.
Scott
-------------------------------------------------

HAMMER: Originally employed as a weapon of war, the hammer nowadays is
used
as a kind of divining rod to locate expensive parts not far from the
object
we are trying to hit.

  MECHANIC'S KNIFE: Used to open and slice through the contents of
cardboard
cartons delivered to your front door; works particularly well on boxes
containing leather seats.

  ELECTRIC HAND DRILL: Normally used for spinning steel Pop rivets in
their
holes until you die of old age, but it also works great for drilling
mounting holes in fenders, even with the brake line that goes to the
rear
wheels.

  PLIERS: Used to round off bolt heads.

  HACKSAW: One of a family of cutting tools built on the Ouija board
principle. It transforms human energy into a crooked, unpredictable
motion,
and the more you attempt to influence its course, the more dismal your
future becomes.

  VISE-GRIPS: Used to round off bolt heads.  If nothing else is
available,
they can also be used to transfer intense welding heat to  the palm of
your
hand.

  OXYACETELENE TORCH: Used almost entirely for lighting various
flammable
objects in your garage on fire.   Also handy for igniting the grease
inside
a brake drum you're trying to get the bearing race out of.

  WHITWORTH SOCKETS: Once used for working on older British cars, they
are
now used mainly for impersonating that 9/16 or 1/2 socket you've been
searching for the last 15 minutes.

  WIRE WHEEL: Cleans rust off old bolts and then throws them somewhere
under
the workbench with the speed of light.  Also removes fingerprint whorls
and
hard-earned guitar callouses in about the time it takes you to say,
&quot;Ouc....&quot;

  HYDRAULIC FLOOR JACK: Used for lowering a Bus to the ground,  after
you
have installed your new front disk brake setup, trapping the jack handle

firmly under the front fender.

  TWO-FOOT LONG DOUGLAS FIR 2X4: Used for levering a bad door seal.

  TWEEZERS: A tool for removing Douglas Fir splinters.

  PHONE: Tool for calling your neighbor to see if he has another
hydraulic
floor jack.

  SNAP-ON GASKET SCRAPER: Theoretically useful as a sandwich tool for
spreading mayonnaise;
  used mainly for getting dog-doo off your boot.

  E-Z OUT BOLT AND STUD EXTRACTOR: A tool that snaps off in bolt holes
and
is ten times harder than any known drill bit.

  TIMING LIGHT: A stroboscopic instrument for illuminating grease
buildup.

  TWO-TON HYDRAULIC ENGINE HOIST: A handy tool for testing the tensile
strength of ground straps and brake lines you may have forgotten to
disconnect.

  CRAFTSMAN 1/2 x 16-INCH SCREWDRIVER: A large motor mount prying tool
that
inexplicably has an accurately machined screwdriver tip on the end
without
the handle.

  BATTERY ELECTROLYTE TESTER: A handy tool for transferring sulfuric
acid
from a car battery to the inside of your toolbox after determining that
your
battery is dead as a doornail, just as you  thought.

  AVIATION METAL SNIPS: See hacksaw.

  TROUBLE LIGHT: The mechanic's own tanning booth.  Sometimes called a
drop
light, it is a good source of vitamin D, &quot;the sunshine vitamin,&quot; which
is
not otherwise found under Busses at night.  Health benefits aside, its
main
purpose is to consume 40-watt light bulbs at about the same rate that
105-mm
howitzer shells might be used during, say, the first few hours of the
Battle
of the Bulge.  More often dark than light, its name is somewhat
misleading.

  PHILLIPS SCREWDRIVER: Normally used to stab the lids of old-style
paper-and-tin oil cans and splash oil on your shirt; can also be used,
as
the name implies, to round off Phillips screw heads.

  AIR COMPRESSOR: A machine that takes energy produced in a coal-burning

power plant 200 miles away and transforms it into compressed air that
travels by hose to a Chicago Pneumatic impact wrench that grips rusty
bolts
last tightened 60 years ago by someone in Springfield, and rounds them
off.

  PRY BAR: A tool used to crumple the metal surrounding that clip or
bracket
you needed to remove in order to replace a 50 cent part.

  HOSE CUTTER: A tool used to cut hoses 1/2 inch too short.

  SPANNER WRENCH:  a bedeviling wrench that causes you to improvise with
a
pair of Craftsman needle-nose (see NEEDLE NOSE PLIERS) freeing you up to

waste several hours attempting to get the Spanner nut off but breaking
the
needle-nose and causing you to drive 3 times to 3 different Sears stores
to
replace them.  You forget to buy a Spanner Wrench while you're there
each
time.

  SNAP RING PLIERS:  see SPANNER WRENCH.  Causes all above the same
effects
with the addition of finally getting the ring off, but at 450 mph
straight
into left eye.

  NEEDLE NOSE PLIERS:  see SPANNER WRENCH and SNAP RING PLIERS.  Useful
for
breaking while attempting to remove spanner nuts and snap rings.
