I've done it...I have a hooper style sandblaster and just went and bought
6 lbs at the store(32 cents/pound).  Dumped the sand out and put the
baking powder in....

works great!

I told the folks at the truck shop about it at the company i work for and
the url for the company that promotes and sells it...they got a demo and
are into it big time now.  It works great!

BTW it is &quot;food safe&quot; and environmentally &quot;invisible&quot;.
The stuff that the company uses is granulated somehow instead of being
total powder.  I suspect it works better than the powder.

I haven't tried it on aluminum yet, but I have used it on both metal
backed chrome and plastic backed chrome.  Worked great to get mineral
deposits off of both.

I figured it would be *really* great for carbs....any baking soda left
could be just washed off and any that remained after that would dissolve
in the gasoline....not like sand or bead blasting...

It's probably not good to breath the stuff but it is &quot;listed&quot; as a
nuisance dust.  I like my lungs jsut the way they are , so I have a good
mask anyway.

Anybody else got any ideas for what it might work well on?

Cheers, dave

&gt; Hello all,
&gt;   I was doing some reading in an old Magazine(kit
&gt; car or street Rodder?) Anyway they were doing
&gt; some blasting of chrome parts but were using
&gt; baking soda and not sand. They said that the soda
&gt; did not harm the chrome but would strip off paint
&gt; and other stuff to reveil just the chrome. They
&gt; also used it on aluminum, and some other softer
&gt; stuff. It looked like it would work real good. I
&gt; think they just used a normal sand blaster. The
&gt; question I have is, were do you get bulk baking
&gt; soda, and has anyone ever tried this before?
&gt;   I think it would work good for cleaning vintage
&gt; parts like door handles, pot metal parts, rear
&gt; veiw mirrors, and other stuff.
&gt;   When I find the mag. I will try to scan the
&gt; artical for the list, if interested.
