Subject: Re: [VB] Polyurethane foam as bus insulation?
Message-ID: &lt;0.1ec666ce.25688c07_at_aol_dot_com&gt;

Hi Michael,
We have been thinking of trying out styrofoam that one can buy in large 4X8' 
sheets.  cut, and channel it to fit the smaller frame members, but making 
sure to make it about 1/4&quot; less thick than any area it is to be installed.  
Then glueing that silver mylar bubble wrap to one side of the styrofoam which 
should take up most, but not all of the last 1/4&quot; of thickness.  The smooth 
side of the mylar bubble wrap against the styrofoam, and the bubble side 
away.  When installed the bubble mylar against the sheet metal should allow 
breathing, and thusly hopefully reduce the chance of moisture getting trapped 
for long periods causing rust.  If we do this we are going to take roofing 
tar thinned down a bit with kerosene to thinly coat the inside sheetmetal to 
add a final protective coating.  After installing the insulation then we are 
probably going to install a wood panel interior over the walls, and ceiling.
  We have been lucky to find a 1959 shop &quot;Technical Bulletian&quot; that shows how 
to insulate the cargo area in a panel, including smooth floor covering.  It 
uses a Expansit K 25 material (30mm, or 1.18&quot; thick.) that really looks like 
the styrofoam sheeting of today, and a hard fiber board covering.  Even gives 
measurements, and patterns for the hard to get right curved areas.  The only 
fancy part of this kit is making a sheet metal angle to be welded up on top 
of the roof frame inside of the bus all along where the rain gutter runs on 
the outside.  Lastly it mentions using a bituminous (Bitumen = roofing tar!) 
paint, obtainable from all large oil refineries can be used as an alternative 
protection against corrosion.
