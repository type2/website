Subject: Cab divider installation-
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

Alright list, here goes:
I've got a really nice cab divider for my '59 panel, but I'm having a heck of 
a time getting the thing in the channels...
A few of the edges have a bit of wear and have gotten a bit rough, but not 
bad.
How do you go about getting these things in? I've got it to the point where 
the right side lines up w/ the holes, but the left side is about a 1/4 inch 
short...?? I've used friends help for pushing and even tried to tweak the 
channel a bit. This thing is a pain to install, but they sure do quiet up the 
cab when your driving around a tin can (empty panel w/ just a rubber mat... 
thanks for the mat Isaiah!). 

BTW--BNNTA was a blast, even though I had to take off after night one for my 
momma's 50th b-day (boy i never heard the end of that!). It was great meeting 
up w/listees (Isaiah, Woody, John, Shawn, Terry and many others, plus hanging 
w/ all the DBG'ers), but I was disappointed I never did meet NQ (saw you 
riding in the nice green single right before I had to take off...). maybe 
next year, huh? And as always, the DBG never cease to have a great time and 
be as welcoming as ever! You guys make the shows in the midwest.

Thanks and take care-
Pete
