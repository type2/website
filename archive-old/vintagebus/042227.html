&gt; I just called the my local  county  DMV Registration office and they say the
&gt; tittle to my 71 bus had been junked!  What am I gonna do now?  The Body of
&gt; the 71 is great, spent most of it's life in California.  I have the tittle
&gt; to my 76 but it sure is rusty and I will soon have the title for a 73 that's
&gt; not in the best shape too. Hmm what should I do?  Any advice gang?

Talk to the DMV again.  Was the title &quot;junked&quot; by accident?  Mine was once
and it was a matter of them pushing a few buttons to fix it.  Go there in
person, during a not-busy time, and make nice and they will be a lot more
helpful!
