&lt;&lt; 1) Is there a way to tell a 6v motor from a 12v? I have two complete 
assemblies in my garage, one is part #211 955 111 Q, the other one is #211 
955 113 G. Does anyone know a way to figure out what voltage they are?&gt;&gt;
Hi Cris,
You can hook them up to a battery charger or battery/ies.  On 12 volt, 6 volt 
motor will try to do warp speed.  On 6 volt, 12 volt motors will move a 
little faster than a glacier.  
  There is also a type 2 parts book posted somewhere on the internet.  
Somebody here on this list must have the web address.
  Our parts book shows the &quot;Q&quot; version as 6 volt for 1966 model year.

&lt;&lt; 2) Is there a source for the motor brushes anywhere?  &gt;&gt;
You should check with your local electrical rebuild shop that does work on 
starters/generators/alternators.  At worse they will have a brush that will 
work after you apply a little hand machining.   Eric&amp;Barb
