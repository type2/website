Well that tent $ even exceeded my expectations. I
figgered it would go for about a grand. Damn nice
tent and you would be hard pressed to find another NOS
in the box one. Nota  bad profit margin either for the
seller. Isn't that what e-bay is all about- it is
not like the buyer had a gun against their temple
saying you must bid on this.

Can you imagine actually going camping with a $1400
tent??
