Go to Wal Mart and buy some mini bungee cords, they come about four to a
pack, then head over to the shower curtain area and pick up a nice heavy
cloth shower curtain, you can string the cords alongside the windows and
trim the curtain to length, then you can string cords from the fresh air
plenum to either side of the bus behind the front seat and hang your curtain
on the cords.
good luck

Subject: [VB] Curtains


&gt; Winter should be setting in here sometime in the next month. I've got
&gt; my heater working, but would like to hang some curtains between the
&gt; cab and the cargo area of my '59 Kombi (bench seat). I bought some
&gt; good material today from a place that was going out of business.
&gt; So....
&gt;
&gt; Can anyone send suggestions on how to hang curtains between the cab
&gt; and cargo area as well as on the side cargo windows of my bus? What
&gt; kind of DIY stuff works the best? Pictures? I want solutions I can go
&gt; and buy at WalMart or the hardware store or something. I'm not
&gt; interested in hunting down Westy stuff or anything. So lowbuck DIY
&gt; stuff would be great.
