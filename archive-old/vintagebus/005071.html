I remember one of the nicest 67 deluxe resto's i've seen was Dana Nye's back
in 87-88. It was featured in how to restore your vw by hot vw's in 88 on
page 102 and shows some nice closeups. I dont know where this guy lives now
but he did live in west Los Angeles at the time. Maybe he is in the phone
book. He must know quite a few details about proper resto on these. Good
luck. Or throw the Q's out there to the list.
