Getting ready to repair and install the rear half of the SC's wiring
harness. I need a source for the various sizes of harness sheathing
material. Most of the wires are in OK shape but I need to replace the torn,
warn and damaged sheathing. I don't really want to just wrap the harness in
electrical tape and let it go.

TIA

Bill
