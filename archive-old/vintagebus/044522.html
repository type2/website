&lt;&lt; Looking for original side step for my 67 kombi and also rear gate for 59

Hi Dan,
Which style are you looking for? There are at least five different models 
made out of various materials that were sold by VW and thier dealerships that 
mounted below the front doors, or between the jack points on the sides.
