Most definitely, but I carry a spare set of points and condenser for if it goes out. I actually have a swap meet 009 distributor with points and condensor already installed for my backup. That is the only drawback is when they go they shut down completely. I have run Pertronix Ignitor and Compufire and they both seem about the same. I have heard rumors on both sides. Just stick with magnetic instead of optical as they are less finicky with dust and oil. Out of my 5 aircooled cars 4 of them are running electronic ignitions and I will never go back.
