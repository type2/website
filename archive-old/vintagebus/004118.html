Even though I will probably never own a watercooled VW, you can't blame VW
for changing their cars over time.  Our beloved VW's were designed to be
economical and CHEAP.  These cars were built so people could afford to have
one automobile for transportation purposes.  Times have changed!  Now it is
not uncommon for people to have three or four autos in their stable.  If VW
still manufactured a non reliable, maintenece needy, oil leaking, no heat
having car; how many would they sell to U.S. customers?  Very few.  I am a
Union worker and support buying new American automobiles, but I have to
admit the quality and craftmanship in my girlfriends new beetle is second to
NONE!  The old geezers on this list wouldn't support anything new.  I also
think the new bus is ugly, but the fact is they still build a quality auto.

P.S. I did dig the SC and DC computer altered pics though!  Especially since
they were slammed!  Damn I'm glad to be young and un-grouchy!

&gt; Besides, it's not a Mutant Honda like you were trying to connect here,
don't
&gt; you forget it! It's a VOLKSWAGEN!

&gt;
&gt; Don't you forget that the Volkswagen of today is NOT the Volkswagen of
old...not even close.  That Volkswagen died stopped supporting the older
cars and completely divested themselves from their past.  Well at least
until they could exploit it for the NB.
