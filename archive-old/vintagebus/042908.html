You're kidding, right?  That's like asking if the Pope is Catholic.  Gene
Berg has been know for years to be the king of the hill, the top of the
line, A++++++, in quality and service.  If you have the chance to buy a
complete Gene Berg motor (and can afford it) I'd say buy without a second
thought.  I've used some Gene Berg parts and they are excellent in
quality.  I especially like all the technical articles and instruction
booklets that Berg puts out that Gene Berg himself wrote when he was still
with us.
