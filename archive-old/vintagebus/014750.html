well ladies and gents i picked up the single cab tonight.like i said it is 
rusty.no engine,no emblem,and the roof is damaged.i havent pulled the 
numbers on it yet but it has the nipple turn singnals and the lil round 
tailamps,but it has a 8 fuse fuseblock.all the wiring looks good and 
unhacked.the dash is mint the nose still looks good but the holes for the 
emblem has been filled.it has a front bumper inside the cheasure chest 
complete with brackets,it also has a deluxe style rear bumper with 
mouldings,brackets and also the corner filler that goes between the bumper 
and truck.i will try to get a quicky web page up in a day or 2 with pics of 
the truck like i said i am going to part this thing out and hopefully get my 
money back.

thanx
mike
