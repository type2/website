&gt;VERY UNUSUAL SEATING PATTERN ALLOWS INTERNAL ACCESS FROM FRONT
&gt;SEATS TO CAMPER AREA,(DO NOT NEED TO GO OUTSIDE THE VEHICLE.)

Last year my friend Darren acquired a very unusual 57 Sundial Double Door Panel
originally a bench seat but modified to a walk through.  It wasn't a hack job,
someone had taken some time thinking, designing and fabricated it, definitely
not VW but It was done very well. Does anybody know if these were done at or by
sundial or was it just modified by a previous owner? As anyone seen one of
these? I wished I'd of taken some pictures, but Darren traded it for a Puck!
