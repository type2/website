Subject: [VB] Rattling sound


&gt; I am having a problem with a rattling sound (marbles in a coffee can)
&gt; which sounds like it is coming from the area just above the
&gt; transmission. The rattle occurs in gears 2 through 4 and only happens
&gt; with partial throttle. My bus had a front solid mount. I replaced the
&gt; mount with a German rubber mount (big studs). After completing the
&gt; job, the rattle appeared. If I lightly apply pressure to the gear
&gt; shift lever the sound goes away. Why would the rattling only appear
&gt; with rubber mounts? This one has got me stumped. Any ideas?
&gt;
&gt; I also noticed that the accelerator cable rubs against the side of
&gt; the transmission. It looks like the transmission sits right in the
&gt; pathway for the cable. The transmission even has a groove worn into
&gt; it by the cable sliding over it for many years. Is this a normal
&gt; condition or do I need to make some changes?
&gt;
&gt; Thanks,
&gt;
&gt; Rocky
