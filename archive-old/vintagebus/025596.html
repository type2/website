Hi all,

This question goes out to all of you 12 volt converters (Beefcake).
What are you doing with your 6 volt stuff.  I assume many of you are
buying new stuff and just setting the 6 volt stuff aside right.  Well
instead of just letting it take up space, drop me a line.  I need a fly
wheel, two batterys, a starter, the voltage regulator, the generator,
and any of the 6 volt bulbs you have.  I'm trying to get my 65 up and
running and want it to be 6 volt as it was prior.  All of you
converters, should have some of this lying around.  Drop me a line, I
would love to save some cash and not buy it all new.

I know that there are core charges on some of the stuff when it is
bought new, but I would assume that some of you are getting a lot of the
12v stuff from the junkyard and not new.

Thanks,
Aaron
