Ok.......I promise....this is the last public peep out of me on this
subject!

        The biggest flaw in communicating with others via an electronic
system as we do is the fact that things like personality and a sense of
humor can not be transmitted along with words.  You dont see Mr. Hoover
chuckle as he reads your question.  You dont see the grin on his face as he
words a phrase with MUCH sarcasm.  You dont see him reach down and pet his
dog &quot;Bulli&quot; (or whatever) and say, &quot;Whoa, this newbie needs help!&quot;

        I have meet the &quot;nicest&quot; people in the world via this discussion
group.  I have seen them appear as &quot;stick-in-the-muds&quot; or, on the other end
of the spectrum, a piece of crap, &quot;narrow minded loser&quot; simply based on
their posts.  But, after I have met them in person, I thought to myself,
&quot;This is the kewlest person I have ever met&quot;.  

        I have met Ken Hooper and sat up thru most of the night sipping a
brew and talking V-dubs and what not with him (sorry if I am ruining your
rep, Ken) until the wee hours and remembering going to bed thinking, &quot;man
is he kewl!&quot;.  I have met Rick Dennis several times.....he is always a ball
of smiles and jokes.....simply a FUN, HAPPY guy to be around.  Mike
Gensler, down in San Antoio,TX invited my wife and I to stay at his place
during a LONG v-dub trip South.  They did not know me at all.  They fed us,
escorted us around, and put us up with no reimbursement expected.  Ted
Finesman, Joe Fournier,  Bill Bowman, Rob Dahlgren, Charlie Ford, Jon
Christensen.....are the best people a person could ever meet. Without the
list, I would have never met these folks. 

        Even people I havent met just make me smile.  Clara, George, Ellis,
Eric....and especially Thom.  The thing I admire most about Thom
Fitzpatrick is that he always manages to add a sense of humor to his posts.
I appreciate this from our Admin.  It reminds us that we are people with a
common passion....not just info hungry robots.

        In short, what I do is imagine a silly smile on a listee's face as
they raz you about whatever they are typing.  I have not met a listee that
I havent liked a lot.  I am sure if we all met Bob Hoover and his wife in
person...we would see the tone that we so frequently misinterpret from a
completely different angle.

See you all at BBTA,
I will be the red '69 with the US Flag flowing all the way
down the side with a cold one in my hand for you!
