&gt; &lt;&lt; Actually,
&gt;  what I need is a giant garage with attached house.
&gt;   &gt;&gt;
&gt; Or maybe just a sleeping loft inside the garage. That would leave more space
&gt; for a larger shop. ahhh yes thats the ticket.

There's a commercial on television for a motor oil that has a guy with a HUGE
garage... dwarfs the house attached to it... the only thing he's missing are a
few daily drivers and a few project buses in his garage...

And, for my money, Kendall oil, not Penzoil or whatever they were selling in
the ad...
