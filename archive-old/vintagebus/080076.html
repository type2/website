Subject: expanding gas tank

Hey,

I think there may be a safer way of expanding a gas tank to remove dents
like you are suggesting...perhaps after cleaning the tank thoroughly,
filling with water-and letting that expand either via the sun or putting on
a hot plate at a low temp...i don't know if these things are painted or
not...so I guess that might cause some problems... if they are.

I haven't tried this, but I think it would work, and be safer than
overfilling a tank with gas...
