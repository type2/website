Subject: fuel tap Q's

Hello listmembers,

I am going to be doing a baywindow fuel tank swap in a couple of days here.  
I think my bus at one time had a fuel reserve tap on the tank.  The tap is 
gone, but I have two knobs, one on each side of the heater control knob in 
the cab of my bus.  One of the knobs is for the also missing gas heater, 
I've figured that out.  The entire switch box for the heater is still 
installed there.  The second knob is, I think, for the fuel tap.  It is 
light grey, about the same size as the gas heater switch, and has a raised 
&quot;H&quot; on the surface of the knob.

Anyway, since I have the control for it, I am considering adding a fuel tap 
to the new tank I will put in.  My bus is a 1964 kombi (231), and the parts 
manual specifies that part number 211 209 021E fuel tap was used on busses 
from chassis 20-117902 on ambulance models (27*), and from the same chassis 
up to 802 985 on other types (211 - 268).  I'm assuming that the fuel tap 
was an option that could be ordered on a non-ambulance bus after chassis # 
802 985.  Wolfsburg West has a fuel tap that looks like the one shown in the 
parts manual:

This is a beetle tap, can I install this tap onto a bay window fuel tank?  
What other hardware (cable sleeve? rubber seals?) will I need to get to make 
it work?

WW also has a barndoor era fuel tap, but I assume that like all other 
barndoor parts, it is not reverse compatible ;-)

TIA,
