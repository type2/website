This is just the opposite of what I would have suspected. Because with
heated metal, not only is there more stored energy in the bonds, but the
bonds themselves would be freer to release. So I would have thought that
current would flow through the metal much easier when heated. You seem
very knowledgable, and I don't doubt that what you are saying is so. It
is just that I am having a rough time assimilating this fact into the
whole of my limited scientific knowledge.

Damn good question.  Unfortunately, I'm having trouble remembering fully the
exact reason; however, I'm certain that it has to do with &quot;chaos&quot; and thermal
expansion (more room between molecules).  The chaos theory has it that the
electrons are boinging around more at higher temps, therefore, there is less
&quot;order&quot; available for the smooth transfer of electrons between molecules.  The
expansion part is hard for me to believe, because I wouldn't think that such a
little bit of expansion would make that much additional room between molecules
(to make it harder for electron transfer).  But stranger things are true...

Incidentally, this is why the old Cray supercomputers are cooled with nitrogen
to very cold temperatures.  Electriclal conductivity is improved.  At the
University of Florida, they are doing superconductivity experiments by cooling
metals to a couple of degrees above absolute zero kelvin.  (It is impossible
to cool anything to absolute zero K!)  At this stage, molecular action stops,
and conductivity is the best it can be!  I understand that scientists don't
know the full reason for this and how electron transfer occurs at these
conditions.  I don't know, they might by now...

Power companies get around the power loss problems of thermal expansion in
their transmission wires by transferring electrical power at a very high
potential (like 30,000 volts).  By making power transfers at this high a
potential, electrical conductivity affected by heat seems to be less of an
issue.

That's why they went from 6 volts to 12 volts in busses!  Military and big
riggs use 24 volts.

I probably pegged the &quot;dryness&quot; meter on this one - if someone wants to write
on this topic, make sure there is more bus content and it's more interesting!
