Hello thy listees,

Once again I need your help with my shifting problems. Here goes:

Bus won't shift into reverse, 3rd and 4th. Allways. Nothing there, just
as if I tried to shift into 5th gear.

Last weekend, I crawled uder while a friend was moving the shifter.
There seemed to be some slack in the shift linkage (where 2 rod meets
near the tranny). Me helping the rod to turn just a little more made
shifting possible, almost easy. Worked for reverse 3r and 4th. 

I tightened the linkage and then I could go into 3rd and 4th without
human help at the linkage. Still no reverse. Worked a while and now it
seems like it's back as it was before, no reverse and rapidly
deteriorating 3rd and 4th. 

Oh yeah, with engine off, we tought we had a reverse. On the road, that
turned out to be the 2nd gear *again*. How is it possible that the shift
lever is in the reverse &quot;notch&quot; but the tranny is in 2nd gear?

We didn't touch the shift lever mounting bracket. It was tight.

I have a spare tranny that I could install but I really don't want to go
through that nightmare if the problem is somewhere else.

TIA,

Mathieu
