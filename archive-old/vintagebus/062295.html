If your geometry is correct you either sucked in some valve seats, pounded
both cylinders into the block changing geometry, or the lifters have debris
under the crown and won't seat all the way into their case hole. If your
geometry was right at one time, then one of these is happening.

Hi List,
I was adjusting my valves yesterday and this is what
happened: When I set at TDC #1, I adjusted intake and
exhaust for #1. I then rotated to TDC #4, I found I
couldn't adjust because even with the adjusters backed
all the way off, I still couldn't get the feeler gauge
in. Bottom line, I could adjust #3 and #1 but could
not get feeler in on #2 and #4.
