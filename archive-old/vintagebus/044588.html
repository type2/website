I guess I wanted to chime in here with my $.02 on yet another supplier -
Oregon Performance Products.

I have been thinking real seriously about doing the T4 conversion to my '58.
Did some research on the net including Oregon Performance Products's web site.
Read everything on their website front to back, top to bottom, and still had a
few questions so I sent a quick note to the Email address listed.  Well I
don't know if the guy who answered (said he was the owner) was just having a
bad day, smoking crack, or whatever, but he was quite the sphinkter.  Seems as
how, among other things, I was not a legitimate customer becasue I sent Email
instead of calling on the phone.  Well here is a little clue to all the
retailers out there with a web page - Expect Email if you give an Email
address.  (Duh!)

I will be putting a T4 in the '58 but there will be zero parts from Oregon
Performance Product included.  Like many others out there cost is not the
major consideration on my restoration/rebuild, quality comes first.  For me at
least service is an integral part of quality.  No service, no business.
