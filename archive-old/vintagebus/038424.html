Subject: Fuse on ignition circuit and wiper fuse blown

Hi,

My '63 crew wiring is a mess and I'm starting to sort it out.

1)  I'm considering putting a 15 amp fuse on the + feed wire that goes to
the coil.  As I understand it, this is unfused in the splits and was fused
on the type1 loafs?  Or am I confused -- does it have a fuse.  We are
talking power to a) coil, b) carb choke, c) carb electromagnetic cut-off ...
right?

2)  My wiper in my '63 crew has blown a white fuse twice.  Both times in the
morning when it was cold.  Wipers work fine during day and in other tests...
but when I need them to keep condensation off, they blow :)  Given that my
bus was converted to 12v -- and the wiper goes pretty slow .  My question is
pretty simple -- is a white fuse just under AMPs for a 12v converted wiper?
Any info appreciated...

Thanks.
