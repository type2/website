&gt;Hi all!  I've tried this question off list, but haven't really gotten
&gt;an answer so I'll post it at the risk of sounding too new.  Does
&gt;anyone have any idea why my '65 21-window with a 1500 cc, recent valve
&gt;adjustment, recent tune-up, everything else pretty normal, original
&gt;exhaust,  would only be getting about 12 mpg? I've come across several
&gt;posts and articles saying the busses should get about 20-24 mpg, so I
&gt;am pretty worried that something's quite wrong.

Assuming that it hasn't been lowered so far that the frame is dragging on
the ground, (snotty lowering comments mode off) it could be that your choke
is stuck on, your parking brake is on, your carb float is stuck or
incorrectly set causing an overflow condition, your jetting is way off, you
have a Holley Quadrajet 1000 strapped on that bad-boy, or the neighbor kid
is coming over with a hose at night....does he seem to be driving a lot more
than he used to, yet still appear unemployed?
First order of business, get a locking gas cap.
Second, make certain that you have the correct outside diameter of tires on
the vehicle and that they are properly inflated.
Third, if your 21 window has a sunroof, make certain that the surfboard is
mounted longitudinally along the bus, not perpendicular through the sunroof.
Fourth, if like most of us, you had to walk uphill ten miles both ways to
school, and you still live there, move. Then once you get all unpacked,
check your exhaust. Is it wet and black? Bad. Is it a dry chocolate brown to
tan? Good. Is the carb a Solex or Weber single barrel designed for a 1500 or
is it dual 40mm Dellorto's? Get the instructions for it and go through the
paces. For Solex's you usually get reasonably useful tuning instructions
with a rebuild kit, Webers, I dunno but there are books available. Use them,
setting your float level is not hard, and you should do it as may times as
is required till you are sure it is right. Check your choke operation, and
if one of your wise friends disabled it for you, you as the Mechanic in
Charge (TM) have to check it out for yourself and make sure they didn't
disable it closed. If, after checking all of these things you find that you
still have no joy, tell us what you think it is, then. You should have
developed a hunch by then. Feel free to p-mail if any of this message
suggests any further questions to you or just to pummel me about the head
and shoulders for being a smartass. Hope this helps, if not consider the
source...
