&gt; &gt; I think it should be the opposite, split drivers being too good for

&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Its not that they are snooty...they are just clueless.  Remember, these
&gt; newfangled late models still qualify in some peoples eyes as &quot;just a car&quot;
&gt; 
&gt; They probably even call them &quot;vans&quot; ~shiver~
