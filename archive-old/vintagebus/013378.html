Hi all, 

Well, I'm finally back in the good old USA after a three week Vintage VW
adventure in Europe!  Kathryn and I arrived from our last week of visiting
my family in Ireland on the evening of June 30th.  It was fun to go out
into the garage and sit in my Busses again.  I did spend a lot of the
afternoon at Bad Camberg hanging out amongst the British and German busses,
saw Charlie Hammill, Jerry Jess and Clara as well as many other Bus
dignitaries, and got to drive a '54 RHD Barndoor briefly in England.  I
won't go into detail here about the Tour because in a few months you'll be
seeing a pair of in-depth articles with plenty of photo coverage of the Der
Kafer Fahrer &quot;Return to the Fatherland '99 Tour&quot; by us in VW Trends
magazine. 

Right off the bat, I have to thank my best buddy and co-driver Tom
Niedernhofer for such a good time on this adventure.  Once invited to
participate, Tom and I worked together to get his Denzel ready for this
long journey.  It's always a please to hang out with Tom, and having the
Vintage goal in mind of finishing and debuting his &quot;cool&quot; Denzel on the
&quot;Tour&quot; and at Bad Camberg made it all the more fun!

I'd especially like to thank Brian and Connie Holcomb for all that they did
to make &quot;Martha&quot;, my 1955 original condition Deluxe Sunroof Beetle, the
most reliable and certainly the most trouble free Vintage VW on the &quot;Return
to the Fatherland '99 Tour&quot;!!!  When it became obvious one month before
departure of the domestic &quot;Tour&quot; leg that the painter wasn't going to
finish Tom's '56 Denzel, I had to scramble to get &quot;Martha&quot; fully prepared
and then road tested.  The Holcomb's do incredible Vintage drivetrain
restorations near Milwaukee, WI.  They took &quot;Martha&quot; in for a speedy but
complete precautionary overhaul of her transmission (all eight original
transaxle bearings replaced with new ones, and a set of new &quot;solid&quot; style
axle boots installed).  Tony Moore at Wolfsburg West really came through
for us when he scrambled to locate and &quot;overnight&quot; anything we needed for
the '55 component overhauls.  The Holcomb's opened up and did a &quot;look see
and freshen up&quot; of the original motor.  They pulled out the original cam
with it's &quot;Bakelite&quot; gear and replaced it with an NOS all metal cam and NOS
lifters.  They luckily found hardly any wear on the internal components, in
fact they were able to reassemble her motor with new standard (not
oversize) bearings.  The car only had 54,000 original miles at that point,
and the heads were gorgeous.  She got new rings, a light cylinder hone, and
a three angle valve job with new exhaust valves and new valve adjusting
screws just to be safe.  Finally they completely rebuilt the entire brake
system with NOS or new German ATE parts.  They also threw in all new front
end German bearings, and I had installed a set of those new wide
white-wall, steel belt but vintage-look radials that Rich Kimball recently
touted in his column.  Man what a difference they made!  &quot;Martha&quot; was then
ready to rock! 

Other than the valve adjusting screws replaced during the Michigan VW
Festival (the new set the Holcomb's installed weren't hardened enough and
started to deform, slowly increasing valvetrain noise), she never acted up
one bit.  &quot;Martha&quot; recieved an almost undetectable dent/scratch on her
right front fender for the container shipping on the way to England, and a
few tiny rock chips on her nose from over 5,100 miles from L.A. to Bad
Camberg and back to the docks in England.  She was very impressive!  She
deserves a nice rest now, but first we plan to fly up to accept her on the
Boston docks around July 7th and drive her back home.  By the time she's in
our garage at home here in St. Charles, Missouri &quot;Martha&quot; should have well
over 6,000 miles on the odometer for the roundtrip.

I shot 504 pictures and 4 hours of videotape of the USA crossing, and about
540 pictures and at least 6 hours of videotape on the international Tour
leg.  The Domestic article for VW Trends is already being edited and
composed by Henry De Kuyper for an upcoming issue, and I just need to type
up my extensive notes from the international trip and send them with the
photographs to Henry so they can get cracking on the next European
installment.  Our fearless Tour leader Bill Collins will be covering the
Tour in a future issue(s) of Hot VW's magazine.

Bill Collins and the DKF deserve all the credit for successfully concieving
and executing an incredible plan for a remarkable Vintage VW adventure. 
Nothing on this scale had ever been tried before with such old and rare
VW's, and to the &quot;naysayers&quot; out there who didn't believe we'd all make it,
all we've got to say to you (Morley, etc.) is &quot;neneer-neneer-neneer&quot;!!!

Thanks again to my co-driver Tom Niedernhofer, the Holcombs and to Tony
Moore of Wolfsburg West  for all their help and support of our car '55
Deluxe Sunroof Beetle &quot;Martha&quot; on such short notice!  They really helped
make it all possible, and I'll always appreciate what they did!  Others out
there who deserve our gratitude for their assistance to the DKF &quot;Return to
the Fatherland '99 Tour&quot; in general are:

All the Tour car owner/drivers and co-drivers for the incredible memories
and your company 
Major Ivan Hirst 
Willi Lotterman &amp; Family

And if I've forgotten to thank anyone else in my &quot;jet-lagged&quot; stupor,
please accept my apology and my gratitude!  I can't wait to tell you all
about it around the BBTA campfire soon.

See ya,

A very broke, but deleriously happy...
