&gt;Well, I had a breakdown on the way to busses by the arch, luckily I was
&gt;still in front of my house in Minneapolis! It turns out that one of the
&gt;arms on the clutch/throwout bearing operating broke off leaving me with
&gt;no clutch and a horrible grinding sound. The next day I pulled the
&gt;engine all by myself with the aid of a jack, 2x4 and a skateboard.  I'm
&gt;replacing the clutch, pressure plate, control arm, bearing and tranny
&gt;seal. Any other &quot;Must do's&quot; while the engine is on the bench? Also, what
&gt;is the best spline lube? Any helpful hints for re installing?

My list:
1
* clutch disk
* pressure plate
* Rear main seal
* flywheel o-ring
* tranny mounts
* new axle boots
* clutch cable
* muffler bearings
* throttle cable
* oil cooler seals
* engine compartment seal
* throwout bearing
* check fan tightness
* fan belt
* take some emery cloth and clean up the face of the flywheel
* check end play and flywheel runout

All of these things will go a long way to making your road trips worry-free
