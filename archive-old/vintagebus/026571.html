a bit of Christmas/Holiday foolishness first ....


  Jingle Bells

  Crashing through the snow,
  In a Westy Camper bus,
  Over the fields we go,
  Raising quite a fuss!

  We're looking for a tree,
  To take with us back home,
  We hope we find one that is free
  As through the woods we roam!

  &lt;chorus&gt;
     Oh, Jingle Bells, Jingle Bells,
     Making lots of fuss,
     Oh, what fun it is to drive
     In an old Volkswagen bus!

  A day or two ago,
  The Wife said, &quot;Get a tree!&quot;,
  And soon we're riding round,
  The bus, the dog, and me.

  I took the old back roads,
  To see what I could see,
  And hope that I would find out there
  The perfect Christmas Tree.

  &lt;chorus&gt;

  We passed a lot of folks,
  The snow had made them cowed,
  'Cause they stay on only roads
  That were already plowed.

  The snow was white and deep,
  But Bus has lots of pluck!
  And though we slipped and slid around,
  We never once got stuck!

  &lt;chorus&gt;




      The Night Before Christmas

  'Twas the night before Christmas, and all round the house,
  Not a Vee-Dub was running, I felt like a louse.
  The stockings were hung by the chimney with care
  In hopes that St. Wolfsburg soon would be there.

  The children were nestled all snug in their beds
  While visions of Campers danced round in their heads.
  And Mama in her flannel and I in mine, too,
  Thought a cross-country bus tour was a neat thing to do,

  When, out on the lawn, there arose such a clatter,
  Like sounds of a bad clutch; you know how they chatter;
  Away to the window I flew like a flash,
  I loosened the locks and threw open the sash,

  And what to my wondering eyes did appear,
  But a Volkswagen bus, of the earlier years,
  With a little old driver, so pudgy and round,
  That I knew in a moment St. Wolfsburg I'd found.

  And pulling the Bus, through the snow and the cold,
  Was an octet of Beetles, so proud and so bold.
  More rapid than turtles, they strained as they came,
  And he yelled and he screamed and he called them by name,

  &quot;Now, Sunroof, now Oval, now Super, and Sunbug,
  On, Verti, on, Kuebel, on, Karmann, and Goldbug,
  To the top of the carport, to the top of the wall,
  Drive away, drive away, drive away all!!&quot;

  So up to the rooftop this convoy then flew,
  The Bus full of car parts and the Beetles were, too.
  As I drew in my head and was turning around,
  From the chimney St. Wolfsburg came out with a bound.

  He was dressed as mechanics, from his head to his foot,
  And he reeked of old motor oil and ashes and soot.
  A huge bunch of car parts he had stuffed in his sack
  Marked VeeDub and Bosch ... I was taken aback!

  His face was all wrinkled, his eyes so dejected,
  Like parts that he'd ordered were more than expected.
  His feet were all covered with oil, which was dripping
  All over my carpet where he had been tripping.

  He was rotund and jolly, a competent mech,
  But my room now was filthy, a horrible wreck.
  He spoke not a word but went straight to his work,
  With his butt-crack all showing, like some plumber, the jerk!

  Then putting his finger aside of his nose,
  With a wink and a nod, up the chimney he rose.
  He sprang to his Bus, fixed his seatbelt, and farted,
  Then hit the ignition and up they all started.

  He pushed in the clutch, shifted gears with a grinding,
  They all started moving, their engines were winding,
  But I heard him exclaim 'ere he drove round the side,
  &quot;Merry Christmas to all, and to all, a good ride!!&quot;


apologies to Mr. Moore (original author)
and Jim Finn (who adapted it for British Cars, 1992)
&lt;and from whom i shamelessly stole the idea :) &gt;


Part Deux:

more wintery slop. :)


 Otto the Automatic
   (to the tune of Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer)

  Otto the Automatic
  Shifted gears without a clutch,
  And if you ever drove him,
  You might say he wasn't much.

  All of the other buses
  Used to laugh and call him names.
  They never let poor Otto
  Join in any highway games.

  Then one day their clutches broke,
  And they could not shift gears.
  Otto towed them one by one
  To the Mech who fixed their rears.

  Then how the buses loved him,
  As they shouted out with glee:
  Otto the Automatic,
  You'll go down in Bus-Story!!!




  Rusty The Syncro
  (to the tune of Frosty the Snowman)

  Rusty, the Syncro,
  Is a big old happy van,
  With his extra gear, you need never fear
  Going four-wheel cross the land.

  Rusty, the Syncro,
  Has this extra stuff, you know,
  So his front wheels grip if the rear ones slip
  And you mush right through the snow.

  There must have been some little gnomes
  That built him underground,
  Cause when he gets into the woods,
  He begins to dance around.

  Rusty, the Syncro,
  Loves to play in mud and snow,
  And to climb those hills, just for extra thrills,
  Go where buses shouldn't go.

  Rusty, the Syncro,
  Is a stable sort of van,
  While the others slip, his four wheels will grip,
  And he'll muddle through again.

  Down through the village,
  He will drive with little doubt,
  Over ice and snow, anywhere he'll go,
  While the others slide about.

  He'll drive right through the streets of town,
  All axle-deep in slop,
  And he only pauses, if at all,
  When a red light makes him stop!

  Oh, Rusty, the Syncro,
  Had to hurry on his way,
  But he waved goodbye, saying, &quot;Don't you cry,
  I'll be back again someday!&quot;

:)

from the old days of aircooled buses and weak heaters ...



  For Those Who Take Trips in the Winter
      by Robert W. Service-Advisor

  Strange tales are told, 'bout the Winter's cold,
  In Volkswagen buses so true,
  When the wind's fierce howl drowns the tranny's growl
  And there ain't enough heat for you.
  When that very same wind is trying to bend
  The steering wheel out of your hand
  And your muscles all ache when you step on the brake
  To slow the Velocity Van.
  With the numbness that spread from your butt to your head
  'Cause the feelings gone out of your toes,
  And you're wondering where, in that junk pile back there,
  Are those warmer and woolier clothes.

  For the three hundredth time, you receite the rhyme
  And the reason that caused you to go
  On this journey through land made dead, white, and bland
  By the hands of Ol' Winter and Snow.
  But you arrive there on time, in the arctic-like clime,
  And relate to them all of the pain
  Of the bone-chilling cold, and the driver so bold
  To have beaten Ol' Winter again.
  Through the window you stare at the bus parked out there,
  Covered now all over with snow;
  And next time, for sure, you swear now to cure
  Those heater boxes down there below!

Forth and final:

Believe It ... or Don't Department
Willy &quot;Bill the Bard&quot; Shakesbeer drove a vw bus!

              Sonnet xviii

  Shall I compare thee to the summer's days?
  Nah, for thou art too ugly and too fat;
  No lines of grace nor speed thy form displays,
  More like the Snail, with speed akin to that;
  But when the showers of April are forgot,
  And darling buds of May do grace the land,
  Are thoughts of camping given rein to trot
  Within the wintered hearts and minds of Man,
  For it is then thy use belies thy form,
  As catepillar turns to butterfly,
  From cargo's bus to camper's little dorm,
  You turn whenever weekends happen by.
       So long as campers camp, from sea to sea,
       So lives a Bus, and those who camp with thee.


               Sonnets  xxix

  When, in this race of Fortune and men's lies,
  I often sit alone and contemplate ...
  Where might I be, had I been much more wise
  In choice of cars with which to link my fate?
  What might I drive to work, to play, to cope
  In rageous traffic, more than some can bear,
  Were I to let someone decree my scope
  In what to drive, to say, or clothes to wear?
  How more in profit might my time be spent
  Than nursemaid to some broken old auto?
  A smile replaces brow with troubles bent
  As to the wheel I climb and off I go ...
       And though my drives through rolling country end,
       I love this bus, this one that makes me grin.
