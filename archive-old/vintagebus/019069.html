I've created a small web page and petition form for the Bentley Pre-63 Manual campaign.

http://www.vintagebus_dot_com/bentley.html

Feel free to copy the form to your own site, just don't change the form parameters, which
would break the script.

In addition, if your bus isn't already in the registry, you might consider adding it - 
it's time like these when we need to show our &quot;market power&quot; that it's helpful!  Once we get
a significant number of replies, or a couple weeks go by, I'll notify Bentley of the results.

Thanks!
