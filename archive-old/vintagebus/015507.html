Depends on the state.  For instance, I've heard of kit-kars being
titled as the year of manufacture.  In California, it appears to be the year
of sale; my 'DD  was built 11/59, but sold in '60, so it's a 60.  I've
seen other examples of a car built in sept, but sold in Jan the next year, so
it's the next model year.  This seems to be the most common, as back
then, the customer wanted the newest available, ie a '60 and not a '59.
In either case, it it's already title, that's what it is, unless you go
and get it changed otherwise.

Another example is the Kubel on ebay a while back; it was a '42, but 
titled as a '59 'cause that's the year of the bug pan it was sitting on.
I wonder if that's what beetlemex is doing; using late bug pans on Mexican
bodies.

&gt; What determines the year model of your bus? Production date? chassis date?
&gt; ect.??? Or is it just the way it's titled? I know a car bought in '87 could
&gt; very well be an '88 year model car...know what I mean? Enough question
&gt; marks in this email? What do ya think?
