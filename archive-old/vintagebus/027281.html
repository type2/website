Speaking of turns to lock, I recently popped off the pittman arm(correct name???) so I could straighten the wheel (wasn’t too successful as there is too much play in the center pivot).  Upon centering up the wheel I reinstalled the arm.  To my dismay, I must have turned the wheel too many times as my turn to the left is WAY to short!  I think the QEII could make a left hand U turn in less space.

Is there a quick way to determine when the steering box is centered in its throw??  How many turns from lock does the output shaft have to go to get centered??

Thanks.

I spent some more time playing with the steering box/column last night.
I detected some play, which I wanted to measure at the wheel, so I went
to put a wheel on it.  We already knew our threads were buggered, but
guess what?  So was the keyway!  So I had to clean up the keyway with a 
small file before I could install the wheel.

Turns out there was a little better than 3/16&quot; of play measured at the
locking portion of the collar.  That extrapolates to a LOT at the wheel;
we measured it, but I forgot the exact measurement.  I wasn't able to
adjust it out without causing binding in the box.   Is this thing rebuilt,
or was it just repainted?

But here is why you can't  (or shouldn't) use a Brazlilian box, irrespective
of the source: A normal box has 2 1/2 turns of the wheel lock to lock;
the brazlian one has 4 3/4!   It would be like driving a semi!  Strangely,
the Bus Boys guy didn't mention this to me, although I'm sure they know.

So it looks like I'm going to KP with sloppy steering.
