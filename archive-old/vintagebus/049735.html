&gt;Ken,
&gt;
&gt;Yes, it is the wire running to the little clear box. I reconnected it
&gt;and still nothing. Do you suppose I may have shorted something out?

Wel, now what you do is follow the conversation about your volt/ohm meter.
Was that on the bay list? I'm pretty sure it was. You find the source of
the power --there is 12V somewhere in the circuit-- and then you see where
the power stops. Daniel Simmons is looking for a good &quot;real-life&quot; bus
electric problem for his page so if you would get a multimeter this would
be a great one.

(Daniel, one of the problems I noticed in my few adventures with the digi
multimeter is that it can't measure turn signals because the pulses come
too fast. All I can get it to do is blink &quot;L&quot;. So it's indicating voltage
in a binary way which is what you wanted, really. 8)

&gt;
&gt;If it is corrosion, it's on the spade connector in the box and I
&gt;wouldn't be able to clean it. The turn signal unit is a new one as of
&gt;3 months ago, so it's clean.

Actually it is highly likely to be corroded in the brake light pod, either
at the push-on spade connectors or inside where the little contacts
actually touch the bulb. It gets very grody in there and I'm always
surprised that anybody's brake lights work at all. 8)
