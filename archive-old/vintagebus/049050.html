I'm looking at four weird fuses. They have four ridges or rings. Looks like bamboo segments. Found 'em in a bay window as Karl and I were relieving it of it's BN4 (at a salvage yard). Karl sez they're original, but he was full of adrenalin or bus heater fumes. Same metal caps as the grooved fuses, just ribbed. Even if you don't know what they are, give us a good story on Friday. 

I just uploaded a pic of them to www.egroups_dot_com , vintagebus area, vault. While you're there look at a Rarest-of-the-Rare picture... Thom NOT buying a bus. I think it was the same weekend he scored the panels.
