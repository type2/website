Subject: Bus rear-end parts sale, Bay Area


Hi again!

It's time to pare things down even more, and I have been collecting
rear end small parts for years, at great expense. I wish to sell off
most of them, keeping just what I need for spares, as I actually
succeeded in talking Rick Long into building me an all-out tranny 
last year, and I don't think I'll need all these parts. I bought these
all from Long Enterprises, and Rick is the best in the business, 
period, IMO.

These parts are NEW, (there are some used parts farther down).  
They are all in the bags/boxes they arrived in from Long's. The 
price I paid for them is indicated, along with the price I'm asking, 
which is lower in all cases. I just want to get them on their way to
others who can use them, and I need the extra income for traveling. 
So here we go:

PAID price/MY price

2 Roller Bearings, N207E, FAG, Brazil  $40/$30
2 Roller Bearings, N207E, SNR, France  $40/$30
1 Upper Ball Bearing, 6305, SKF, Mexico  $20/$15
3 Diff. Side Gear snap rings   $5/$4
7 Oversize fulcrum plates   $13/$10
1 Normal size fulcrum plate   $10/$8
4 Oversize 4.2mm diff. side gear thrust washers  $6/$4
2 clutch forks, standard old-style diameter shaft (pre-71) $???/$6
3 Clutch Fork Bearing rebuild kits for above forks    $3/$1.50
1 stub axle nut      $6/$4
2 stub axle snap rings     $5/$4

USED parts:
These are parts I have saved from rebuilds, as emergency spares,
due to the ever-increasing prices of stuff. They are relatively 
low mileage parts, under 8K miles, and show little or no wear
marks, and no damage. I've decided to offer them for sale cheaply,
rather than throw them out. You would buy them as back-up 
spares to use when the world comes to an end, and you can't get 
new ones. They're clean parts, and undamaged. If they are priced 
too high, make me an offer.

4 Ball Bearings, 6306, FAG, Germany, used $5 each
4 Roller Bearings, N207E, FAG Germany, used  $6 each
2 Ball Bearings, 6305, FAG Germany, used  $5

Email me at the usual place, cjay_at_well_dot_com. If you're in the Bay Area,
come over, pick'em up, chat, etc. 

regards, cj
