Subject: Corvallis Oregon Show and Swap THIS SAT

Hey hey Bus People,

I have had a few questions about this so I thought I would make a single
post about this event. Been trying not to advertise too much on the
list, but I would hate to find out someone who wanted to come couldn't
because they didn't get word...

Jurassic Bug-In
Saturday, THIS SATURDAY! July 25
Corvallis, Oregon.
At Independent Bug Werks and adjoining Oregon State University Bon Fire
Field.
Free admission, swap spots $10, Show entry $5. No Pre-registration
required. 

Directions: From I-5 ( we are south of Portland about 60 miles and North
of Eugene about 40 miles) take Corvallis Exit 228, Hwy 34 west to
Corvallis. Be sure NOT to take HWY 228, but EXIT 228. Common mistake.
Anyways, 10 miles from I-5 you head into town, over the bridge across
teh Willamette HWY 34 turns into Harrison St. Continue on Harrison until
9th street. Turn Left on 9th street, and take it to its end at
Washington.  Turn Right on Washington, and then left on 13th, and
bugwerks is 1 block down on the left. If you are arriving Saturday, it
will be very obvious.

Caravans will be leaving saturday for the event the next day in 
Portland. 

There is an informal campout that bus people are invited to.  It is
low-key, but feel free to arrive Fri day or eve, and hang out. Camping
is free in our lot. 

Feel free to call me at Bug Werks daytime at 541-752-4884, or home eves
at 541-754-2579. 

Hope to see lots of listies!
