 &gt; Ok.  I know I'm asking for alot of &quot;yeah rights&quot;, but here it is.  What
 is 
 &gt; the fastest you have ever gotten your bus to? and have you ever gotten a 
 &gt; speeding ticket on the open highway?  Please back up the high numbers
 with 
 &gt; hardware.
 
  &gt;&gt;
no never got a speeding ticket on the highway in a splitty.   Got pulled over 
once, though.  Took me a while to notice, cause I had a really awesome Dead 
tape goping and I was rocking out, while cruising 55 when the speed limit was 
55.  so when I saw the light I pulled over and was confused.  huh? Turned out 
someone had stolen my year tag.    I did get pulled over once in my 65, cop 
said I was doing 53 in a 35 zone, and didn't think it funny when I pleaded 
dyslexia.   I have pulled 70mph in my 61, but that was not top speed.  Think 
I have done 75 in my 65  (3.88 r&amp;p, 1.25RGBs, 205/75R15s) 
 Fastest ever been in a bus was in my ex boyfriends bus, he had one of those 
fat motors, a 1996 or something, (the upright case version, not the type IV 
version) with dual carbs, and a type 3 rear end with a 3.88 r&amp;p and .77 4th , 
and it pegged the speedo.  ('65 80mph speedo)  He put a lot into that motor.  
I can't tell what speed we were going but it was fast. probably 100mph or 
something.  But  It was not easy to adjust those valves.  Lowered buses 
really are not as practical for junkyarding trips, as I'll find all this cool 
stuff, and then the bus rides even lower, but there isn't enough clearance 
between the body and tires...    But it sure went fast.  G forces.
