I recently purchased a 1954 (8/53) bus parts book, and I'd like to make
some copies.  Does anyone have suggestion on how to best accomplish 
this?  As it is, I'm almost done scanning it, my little contribution
to the Obsolete Air-Cooled Documentation Project.  A few individuals
have expressed interest in having a copy of their own, and I have
this fantasy that somehow selling a few copies would help defray not
only the cost of the duplication, but partially offset the cost of
the book itself.
