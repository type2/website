&gt;I saw someone on the web selling NOS Barndoor FAG wheel cylinders for
&gt;$75/pair.  Is that a good price?  I have no idea...
&gt;
Well, I guess it was pretty obvious that that was a good deal, I was
thinking wheel cylinders were usually like $10 each.  My Wolfsburg West
catalog proved that wrong.  Thanks to everyone who responded.  I purchased
them, despite the fact that someone called about them right before me?!?
Dude, major uncool.

My brother confirmed for me that the rear wheel cylinders have the same
part# as Oval Bug front cylinders, which I think Clara mentioned already.

The front Barndoor cylinders are 22.2 mm in diameter, for those interested,
which jives pretty closely with the 7/8&quot; rebuild kits available from NAPA
stores as part# 513.  Rear rebuild kits are available from NAPA, too, 3/4&quot;
(19.05 mm really) is the size.

May your stockings overflow with NOS parts and may your Bus heater keep you
warm.
