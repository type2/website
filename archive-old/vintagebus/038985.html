&gt; this weekend).   Anyway I went down to Sears and spent $8.95 for a 17mm
&gt; allen wrench.  The problem I had was that I  _could_not_  get an angle to
&gt; get
&gt; it open; I fought with it for a couple of hours before I finally gave up in
&gt; disgust.

I've gotten around this by sliding a 17mm box-end wrench over the
allen wrench while slipping it into the side plug on the tranny -- there's
just room for the wrench between the tranny and the frame horn.  Now you
have all the leverage of a wrench to tighten or loosen the plug.  The open
end of the wrench would work too but box end is better for the amount
of torque that might be needed to loosen it for the first time in 20 years :-)

I used to use a 17mm-headed bolt for this instead of the hex key, with a
couple of flats filed on the shank so the vise-grip could get a good
purchase on it.  That worked, but the allen wrench is much more
convenient.

BTW, the MSC catalog (see www.mscdirect_dot_com) has 1/2&quot;-drive 17mm allen
drivers for $11.69 (#00058826, p.1559).
