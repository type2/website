Subject: Perhaps a dumb questuon

My son's 66 bus is popping out of 4th gear. My local VW mech. said to take
it to the gentleman who rebuild it
awhile back.(This is not a warrenty issue) We are friends, but he laughed at
me when I asked him if he would pull the engine and trans and reinstall them
later after the trans is repaired. &quot;It is so simple why don't you and your
son do it?&quot;.He even showed me what to do on a dune buggy, we were leaning on
while &quot;discussing&quot; this issue. I have average mech. skills (my son zero)  Is
it really that simple??Do we need to get a book and do it ourselves? I have
a set of tools metric and SAE but nothing fancy. I often see chatter about
some special 17mm wrench, trouble with seals,etc,etc. My buddy finally said
if I insisted he would pull both, store the bus and reinstall both for $200,
since this shop is his livehood, it sounded resonable to me.
Advise more than welcomed
