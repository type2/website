my opinion is that although we may collect them and let them rot,  many VWs
are saved from junkyards by being yard ornaments for years.   (beinign neglect
being better than destruction).   Eventually someone fixes them  or uses parts
to fix something else.   I have seen some buses deteriorate by being neglected
when others wanted to save them, and though that is not good,  often they will
let it go to the someone they feel is right.  My beloved 61 was a yard
ornament for years, the guy had had it for 20 years and not driven it for a
number of them.  My 65 westy was in a yard of a guy who has loads of VWs
rotting.  So are similar stories with my other VWs.    They were sitting in
funky shape, rotting, or actually destined for the crusher.   I have bought a
bus out of a junkyard, fixed it and sold it as a running bus.     I doubt
everyone is thinking in terms of profits, more that they are cool, and useful
as parts vehicles/I may fix it next spring.  Besides, they are good storage
sheds.     This is why  there are so many around, because of all the wonderful
people fighting the nice neighborhood nazis and the why have that piece of
junk sitting there people laughing at them.    I had a 60 SC rusty truck, and
kept it till I found someone who seemed like they were going to drive it till
I sent it away.    

Plant lug nuts!  They will grow into VWs!

From reading this dribble that apparently boost the ego's of those who have
more yard than sense, I have come to the conclusion that many of you
essentially own junkyards.  

Although this is a respectable vocation, I have to wonder how much profit
you are making from your assorted dying vehicles.  If your making none, I
guess it would be better to term it a &quot;graveyard&quot;.

I have an aquaintance here in Saint Louis that claims to be a collector of
VW's, yet all that he aquires he lets sit out in the elements rotting to
rust and dust.  

Many of the units were solid when he purchased them, but now they are
shells of their original selves.  Yet he refuses to sell any of them.  I
think this type &quot;collecting&quot; is an abomination in the sight of God, Dr.
Pon, and all of mankind.

PS:  I am only semi-serious folks.  I simply hate to see busses go to waste
all in the name of &quot;collecting&quot;.
