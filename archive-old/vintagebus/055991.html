Subject: Re: [VB] Daily Driver, Newer truck parked

It's virtually the same as the boat fan. My switch doesn't get hot, but
there is no denying that it is noisy. But I was surprised how much noise
came through the vents when I finally hooked up the heaters anyway. Also I
only need it at full blast to get the cab warm and then I can turn it down
and it gets quieter.

&gt;
&gt; Not looking for flames but...
&gt;
&gt; I bought one of those kits and was not pleased.  The fan was extremely
&gt; noisey, although it worked okay, and the switch was lousy since it became
&gt; very hot during operation.  This was installed by the book.  I deinstalled
&gt; it and put it away.  Perhaps the boat fan would work better but I haven't
&gt; seen them so I couldn't say.

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;It is a small fan that fits onto the 3&quot; heater channel that goes from the
&gt; &gt;engine to the defrost/heater vents. You cut out a section and clamp this
&gt; &gt;fan
&gt; &gt;in and run a switch to the dashboard. It improves the heat flow by about
a
&gt; &gt;million percent. It blows heat even when you are at an idle.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;There is a company that sells a kit advertised in Hot VWs that is not
&gt; &gt;wildly
&gt; &gt;overpriced, but it is available at any good boating store. Just ask for a
&gt; &gt;3&quot;
&gt; &gt;inline fan.

&gt; &gt; &gt; What is &quot; I put in a boat inline fan to boost the heaters (A GREAT
&gt; &gt;IDEA!!!!) &quot; as Denis Dodson wrote?

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I put in a boat inline fan to boost the heaters (A GREAT IDEA!!!!)
and
&gt; &gt;drove it a week ago in the snow, and I'm installing the AC later this
&gt; &gt;month.
&gt; &gt;Yakima now makes some tower extensions ($40) that make their raingutter
&gt; &gt;towers tall enough for the bus and now I carry ladders on top.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It makes fun out of driving.
