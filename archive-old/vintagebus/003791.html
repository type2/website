Subject: Head light switch needed
Date: Sat, 1 Jul 2000 22:07:25 -0500
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

Well, I've got my headlight switch out and it is cooked - 2 of the 4 prong
thingys that activate the lights are broken right off - sh*t.  Anyway, does
anyone have any suggestions as to where to acquire a head light switch. The
one I have has terminals labelled 30, 58b, 57, 56, 58 does anyone know what
this switch is out of.  I suspect a beetle but ......

I would like a switch that is right for a 60 standard but I'm not that
fussy -

TIA
