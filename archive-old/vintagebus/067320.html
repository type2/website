Throw your type 1 engines in the bone pile (or pawn them off if you can).

Go to upright type 4 power, 200,000 miles with plenty of HP and torque.  Put
hydraulic lifters and cam in and forget about adjusting valves.  Put in
compufire ignition and forget about adjusting the points.  Spend the extra
time getting the rest of the bus up to shape, then take some long trips,
65-70 mph on the flats AND the hills.

The european folks figured this one out a LONG time ago, just takes us
&quot;yanks&quot; a little longer to learn our lessons.

&gt; Let's see how much guff I get for this! Personally I
&gt; would leave your motor alone or go to a 1776cc. It's
&gt; nice to have the extra torque and all that but there
&gt; are sacrifices you have to make.
