&gt; I was over at a guys house yesterday that owns a 1960 Bus.  It still had the original transmission in it due to low mileage.  The owner said that 1st gear has no synchros, similar to my '55 split-case tranny.  He reported that this was normal for the early tunnel-case transmissions, sort of an in-between thing.  I was surprised, I thought once the tunnel-case came around, all forward gears had synchros.  True or False?

I believe that when they introduced the tunnel case tranny in May of 1959, it came with all gears synchronised.  look in a post 59 parts list, it will show the fully synchronised version as of may 59 (ch# 469 xxx) The split case trannys from early 53 till end of their production were not synchronised in first or reverse, meaning you had to be at a full an complete stop to shift into those gears, no downshifting into 1st when rolling, sorry, unless you want to hear it loudly.

Have no idea what the guy with the 60 means about an in between thing, just like Everett said, never heard of that.
