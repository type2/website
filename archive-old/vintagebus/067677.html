Subject: Re: [VB] Investment bus

The only good deals on ebay are the ones that are mis-listed, like
calling it a volswagen, or calling a tilt and bows a &quot;bed liner&quot;

Apart from the oviouss rust in the pix, that bus appears to have been
selectively re-sprayed.  I'm guessing the roof windows rotted out,
and the bondoed them up and re-painted the roof, hence the new seals.
In the shot showing the rear heater tube, check out the expanding
foam peeking thru the cargo floor.  I'll be you a beer the rocker 
was filler with foam, bondoed over, and painted.  Also check out
the off-white line at the line between the cargo floor and the
seat bulkhead - that's a new product caled &quot;RCOR&quot; - rattle can over rust&quot;
And stevie wonder could see the rust on the cargo door sill.

If this much is easy to pick out from the pix, just think was the
underbelly looks like?
