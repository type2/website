&gt; &gt; I had a 66 or 67 that was made by them. Or at least the name was on the
&gt; pop
&gt; &gt; top. Didn't have any original interior left though, I fitted westy stuff
&gt; in
&gt; &gt; it. Driver side had a long picture window, stationary in the middle and
&gt; &gt; louvered opening window to either side of it. regular kombi windows on the
&gt; &gt; passenger side. lovely cream over doo doo brown color combo

This one has regular windows fitted with louvered windows. No big picture
window.
Have a look here
