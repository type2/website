The Golden Gate Chapter of the Vintage Volkswagen Club of America
presents it's 17th Annual Vintage Volkswagen Car Show and Swap Meet
at the San Jose Historical Museum at Kelley Park April 22, 2001 from
8am-3pm

For more information, check out the club's web site at:

    http://www.ggcvvwca_dot_org

As has been discussed in this newsgroup a couple weeks ago, there
are some major changes to the show, including:

    - No modified show classes.
    - Show cars only will be allowed to enter the park.
    - All show cars must park with their class.
    - All show cars must remain parked until after 3pm.
    - No fires or BBQ's.
    - No Alcohol.
    - No pets.

These rules are necessary because of the growth of the car 
show and swap meet. In order to allow the largest number of 
participants, protect the safety of the attendees and their cars, 
and respect the wishes of the park and museum authorities, 
it will be necessary to strictly enforce these rules.

Despite the controversy (see below :-) we expect this to be
a great event this year, with a Vintage VW show, a large swap
meet, and lots of VW fun. Additional events that weekend include
a pre-show dinner the night before (guest speaker Bill Collins)
and other local events sponsored by other Bay Area VW clubs
(see the web page for details).

If you've never been, it's one of the better Vintage VW shows,
even worth the price of a red-eye airline ticket purchased 21 or
more days in advance, and a room at the Motel 6. (that's how
I went to my first one) :-)

===============================================================

okay, that's the blurb. Now here's a little more background information
that I hope will address some of the concerns expressed in this
newsgroup recently. This will make the message very long, feel free to
skip this if you haven't been or won't be going to this event, although
I'll be addressing lots of general vw show planning issues that
might be of interest to others who've never even heard of Kelley Park.

First, some disclaimers:

    - I'm speaking as an individual, although a relatively informed
      one, as a GGCVVWCA member having participated in the discussions
      that led to these changes. I believe I'm expressing the collective
      opinion of the club, but it's just one guy typing, and any
      misrepresentations are my fault.

    - These are the rules. They've been debated carefully for nearly
      a year within the club, and formed with a lot of thought. Not
      everybody is happy about them, even within the club, but these
      are the rules for this show. They are't open for futher debate
      (for this year). I'd gladly collect any constructive input
      for future shows, email ggcvvwca_at_ggcvvwca_dot_org  Bottom line,
      is that it takes nearly a year to plan a show like this, so
      once these rules were settled, they were cast in stone for this
      year. We'll be re-evaluating after the show (like we do every year)

    - This is a vintage show, put on by an all-volunteer staff,
      members of an enthusiastic and active chapter of the VVWCA.
      Keep that in mind when you are critizing things. :-)  This
      isn't a for-profit show being put on by a big promoter. (In
      most years' past, we have made money, but anything beyond the
      club's expenses has gone to charity).

WHY THE CHANGES?
----------------
No single reason, more a confluence of multiple events and evolution
of the show, including:

    - In 2000, the owner/management of Kelley Park (where the show
      is held) changed. I forget the exact details, so I won't elaborate;
      what's important, is that the people we've dealt with for
      10+ years aren't there anymore, and the new management wanted
      to do things at the park differently (their perogative), and
      some of those changes directly impacted our event.

    - The event has grown. A lot. Besides the obvious space problems,
      we've had other problems, including problems that have resulted
      in significant damage to the park (see below) which the club
      has been held liable for. These negativities also reflect poorly
      on the club (and all VW drivers/owners), and it is the club's
      position that we need to make changes to address these problems.

WHAT WAS THE PROCESS?
---------------------
Although to most attendees, last year's show was a great show, there
were some significant problems that needed to be addressed this year.
&quot;What to do about Kelley Park?&quot; has been an agenda item on every club
meeting since last year, and there has been a lot of debate about
what to do.

In the end, the club officers (as a group) took these concerns and
suggestions, forumlated &quot;a plan&quot;, and presented it to the club.

Obviously, no show can be all things to all people, so the club
recognized that our task was to figure out what kind of show we
wanted to put on, and craft that kind of show. That meant prioritizing
all of the things that we valued about our Kelley Park show. These
included (from memory, I forget the exact order):

	1.  Keep it a &quot;Vintage VW&quot; show.
	2.  Keep it at Kelley Park.
	3.  Keep it a family oriented atmosphere.
	4.  Keep the swap meet.
	5.  Address the problems from recent years.

You can see just about all those important points reflected in the
rules. It's not a conspiracy, or a sub-versive plot, it's just a
bunch of volunteers trying to organize the show they want to put on.

We realize that some of these new rules will make some people who
have attended in the past unhappy. It's unfortunate, it's not personal,
but it's also not avoidable. We knew after last year that there would
be changes, so someone was bound to be unhappy. I would encourage anyone
who's really unhappy to get involved, and organize the kind of show 
you'd like to see.

A few more words about each of our priorities from above.

1.  Keep it a &quot;Vintage VW&quot; show.

    There are lots of VW shows in the Bay Area. This show started
    out as a vintage show, original cars only. Old ones. Really
    old ones.  Even in recent years, it remained one of the
    best &quot;vintage&quot; shows on the west coast. We'd like to keep
    it one of the best, and we'd like to keep it focused as a
    &quot;vintage&quot; show.

    What's vintage? That's another long email. For this show (for
    this year), we decided &quot;vintage&quot; is original cars, 25 years 
    or older.

2.  Keep it at Kelley Park.

    People (especially the organizers) like Kelley Park. It's a nice
    place for a laid-back &quot;vintage&quot; show. There's grass, shade,
    historical buildings, etc.  We debated all options, including
    moving the event to a different venue (where it could be larger
    and include more show classes), but overwhelmingly the club
    preferred to keep it at Kelley Park.

3.  Keep it a family oriented atmosphere.

    I don't want to criticize any other shows. I go to most of them.
    I have a good time. So when I try to describe the &quot;atmosphere&quot;
    we want for our show, I'm trying not to insult any other show
    or groups of attendees.

    But the thing is, this show has always had a &quot;family&quot; feel.
    Originally, it was a bunch of club members and their families
    getting together at a neat local park. People liked that. They
    still like that.

    There is no bikini contest, no engine blow, no drag racing,
    no loud music, no alcohol, no BBQ's, no camping. Nothing wrong
    with those things, but they aren't part of our show. There
    are shows that have these things; we want to be a show without
    them.

4.  Keep the swap meet.

    Deleting the modified show classes and stopping general parking
    within the park are two new changes that are partially about space.
    Last year, the park was filled up by 9am. Lots of great vintage
    show cars couldn't get in. We debated deleting the swap meet,
    to make room for more show cars. But we felt that the swap meet
    was an important part of the event, a part people really liked.
    It's a great swap meet, with lots of vintage parts, held on the
    grass, in the shade, in the park. We like that, so we kept it.

5.  Address the problems from recent years.

    Besides the space problems, we've had other &quot;behavior&quot; problems
    which we needed to address. Some people really aren't going to 
    like this, but there isn't any way to say it, without being
    really blunt. So here goes:

	- No alcohol. This is a city ordinance, and has been on
          our rules forever. I don't know if the cops have ever
   	  ticketed anybody, but they could. And the club gets to
          pick up all the beer bottles and other trash. We
          don't enjoy that. (no Marajuana smoking, either).

        - No fires or BBQ's. This is also a city ordinance. Having
          open fires or coals in that park is incredibly stupid,
          given the tight crowds, cars, and historical buildings.
          Even if it weren't against the law, we wouldn't want it.
          Last year, some idiots actually built their fire right
          on the grass. Maybe they had a good time, but the club
          paid hundreds of dollars in damages to fix the burned
          lawn. Luckily, no injuries or fires resulted.

        - No pets. Another city ordinance. Every year some people
          with dogs get turned away at the gate. Every year, some
          dogs sneak in (under a bus seat or something), and every
          year somebody gets in trouble for having a dog in the
          park. Don't bring your dog. He's not invited.

        - All show cars must remain parked until 3pm. Although
          you might be surprised, this is also a city ordinance.
          We can't have any cars moving while the event is going
          on. People who think it's a cruise event should
          be staying outside the gates this year. People who want
          to enter the show, but plan on leaving early, shouldn't
          come in, because the auto gates will be locked by the
          park, and they won't be unlocking them until 3pm.

        - No camping. If you camp on the street the night before,
          the city will be ticketing and/or towing you. Some VW
          events have camping, and make a weekend of it, this isn't
          one of those events.

        - No peeling out and doing donuts in the grass. You wouldn't
          think we need this rule, but it's happened more than once.
          And guess who pays to re-sod the park afterwards? The
          Golden Gate Chapter of the Vintage Volkswagen Club of America.
          I think our record is over $3000 damage to the grass due
          to jerks pulling stunts like this. We don't like wasting 
          that money. Go do donuts in your own damn yard.

(here's the really unpleasant part...)
Lots of the above problems are directly related to the size of
the crowd. Many of the above problems are related to the type of
the crowd. We'd like that type of crowd not to cause problems at
our events. If they can't attend without causing those sorts of
problems, they shouldn't attend.

(okay, I'm still not being very blunt... here goes)
Guess where all the beer bottles are after the show? Guess where
the firepits were? Guess where the cars doing donuts in the 
grass were? Can you guess what kinds of cars these attendees were
driving?

                          Modified VW's.

It might not sound fair to generalize like that, and it really is
just a few bad apples spoiling the bunch, but that's the facts.
It's not disputable, it's heavily documented, and it's just the
way things are. The organizers know it, the park management knows
it, the San Jose Police know it, and now everybody knows it.

The decision to delete the modified show classes, is partly due to
the fact that some of the modified vw attendees in previous years
did not behave themselves.


Okay, there you go. Hopefully, anyone who's read this far, has
an idea of the reasons and thought processes that have gone into
planning Kelley Park.  I'm quite sure some people might disagree
with some of our decisions, and I totally respect that, but hey, it's
our show. :-)
