email address spewed:

[VB] Eriba Puck Value?
Don't cha just love how its only the 'puck' owners
thatcome back defending the wonderf vw-ness and
tremendous 'value' of the pucks. :)I found dozens of
pucks in germany $300-$800

USD..tottaly mint units $1000 shipping is $500-$700
max...the internet is a far reaching tool...check
overseas if you wanna save some money.  Or pay the it
was in Hot VWs, VW trends HYPE prices $3-6 grand! 6
months later you'll wish you hadn't.
-----------------------------------------

Can you smell flame bait?
Smells like the same bitter root flak that I took over
another vehicle in the past year. Have you ever
noticed that it's the folks who never contribute
constructive assistance to anyone and who hide behind
free email accts who come up with the most bitter
attacks?
Whatever dude! You can attack &quot;Deluxe owners&quot; who have
mondo over inflated price tags to defend, you can
attack people who happen to have a pile of once
unpopular double door panels to defend, Binzes,
Dblcabs, single cabs or what ever the flavor of the
day happens to be. But why?
Why not encourage the diversity of interests and/or
the perceived &quot;values&quot; which lay therein? If you
really ARE the sh*t and can locate qtys of these &quot;dime
a dozen&quot; Pucks in &quot;mint&quot; condition then do it! If you
know of an existing market for a product, know how to
fill the need with an existing supply and you don't
step-up and fill that need (and make a deserving
dollar in doing so) then you are either full of beans
or a fool. ~or a non-capitalist who prefers to sit
behind a keyboard and cap on other folks. While you
are at it Mr. Bigshot send me a source for a canvas
tent for my Puck. Share the sources. Attach your real
name and reputation to the sources, information and
opinions instead of dwelling on backhanded passive
aggressive snide remarks. Don't be a dickhead.

Part of the reason that I am personally pretty turned
off to the VW scene, at the moment, is because of this
over commercialization of every nut and washer coupled
with spiteful vindictive competitiveness.
This list used to be fun and funny with more community
spirit. No one seemed to take anything very seriously.
Lately it seems to be more of a shooting gallery.

Last week there was a big defense fostered and
supported that was based on letting the market place
determine the &quot;value&quot; of things. I concur. If someone
wants to spend large bank for an incomplete custom
piece instead of paying the same amount for an awesome
37,000 original mile single cab then that's their
choice to do so. $54k for a barndoor deluxe, $45,000
for a camper, $25,000 for a first year Ghia 'vert,
$250,000-1.25M for a Mercedes Gullwing? or $300-$4,500
for a Puck. Or is it all HYPE as my man, 'ff ff'
suggested? Hey, it's all up to the buyer to decide.
In the mean time 'ff ff' can perform a vacuum test in
my direction.
