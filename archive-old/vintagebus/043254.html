Aloha all,

This is a true need--I've come out from lurking to ask if anyone has one
(OK two if there is that many, though only one is broken at this
point...) wiper shaft for my '65 bus?  It appears that only a '65 fits a
'65, and have not found it from Wolfburg West or West Coast Metric.  I
would truly appreciate the help!

This is my first VW! and I'm trying to get it on the road.  The two POs
were in various stages of restoring.  It has not been on the road for
about eight years!

 Mahalo,
Roberta

P.S.  I've had my '73 2002 for 10 years so do have experience with keeping
a classic vehicle on the road...
