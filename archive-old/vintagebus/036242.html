Subject: e-bay is bad
To: soundex_at_eden_dot_com
CC: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

 i've decided i'll never use e-bay for the sole reason that its causing such 
a problem here. if i have something to sell, i'll let you  guys know via this 
list. i hope in the future i learn more about how to restore my bus and less 
about e-bay.
