All,

I can still source a limited number of NOS 36 hp
cases and P&amp;Cs here.  They are not cheap, but are cheaper
than some of the prices I saw quoted on the list.
I think a case would run around US$700 which would 
include freight from Oz to US.  I think P&amp;Cs would run around US$200
and could go in the same box (depends on overall weight though -
if adding them exceeded post max weight regs they's have
to go on their own with another frieght charge) 

I am not sure on the year of manufacture of the cases
(some 36hp 'replacement' cases were actually manufactured
for some time after the cessation of the 36hp engine?)
or whether the P&amp;Cs are german or brazilian but could
check with my source (up to now everthing I've bought
from him has been NOS german - like early link pins etc)
