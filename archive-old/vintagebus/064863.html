Subject: Re: [VB] Repro taillights.

&gt; WW has those repro taillights... are they good? I
&gt; mean I'm not a &quot;Vintage nazi&quot; of any sort and this
&gt; would do just fine but I would like to get original
&gt; equipment if possible. Anyone knows if there are
&gt; any available out there? 

Hi Andre,

I just went through this about a month ago while
putting new rubber seals on both tail lights.  I love
how a really fast little project turns into a 2 or 3
day project once you get started.  I checked out the
repros because I needed a whole new assembly and I was
not very satisfied with what I found.  The lens
actually looked different with a different pattern and
the assembly was almost entirely different.  I ended
up hunting down a used original assembly from a friend
that looks just like it should.  I think I spent $5
more than I would have spent on the &quot;new&quot; cheap
looking repro but I am much happier with the quality
of what I got.  Not that you asked for it but that is
my two cents worth.
