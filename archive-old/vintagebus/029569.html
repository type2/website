&gt; Uses the bigger 1964-67 brake shoes. But still has the pre-1964 smaller link

&gt; this VW made one year only rear brake drums with the smaller longer splined
&gt; hole,

To get really technical, the brake drums, stub axles, etc., were 2 month only
M215 parts.  These were indeed later 64-67 (rear shoes) on an early small spline
type stub axle, which is about 1/2&quot; longer, ask me how I know!  Some d_at_mn PO put
one of these in my 65 deluxe.  What a nightmare.  Turned out that Bill &amp; Steve's
had a few NOS ones.  I couldn't get the rear drums off and sent it to a shop, who
also coudn't get them off (broke 2 pullers).  Finally cut them off with a radiac,
then realized that I supplied them with the wrong (early) shoes.  I also cut the
drum back a 1/2&quot; so I could use the earlier stub axle, which was stripped.

That's why when you ask for brake shoes for a 64, they (are supposed to) ask
whether it is August/September 63, or after that.
