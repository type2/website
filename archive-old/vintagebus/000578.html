Mid 61 they changed the cargo doors fron high hinge to low hinge.
They also changed the front doors at that time.
Inside door &quot;regulators&quot; changed at this time as well.

&gt;was da difference wit da early split dog leg an da late dog leg?

About 1 1/2&quot; in height.

&gt;an what's all this about the door hinges being at different heights on 
&gt;different years

In '62 (63?) the lowered the cargo door hinge to the belt line to make the
doors stronger.  Some time in the 1600's they developed da english language

&gt;an does any one have a window regulator that notched rail in the front door 
&gt;window channel and are they the same for every year?

They're all the same.
