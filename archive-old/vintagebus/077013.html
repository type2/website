Subject: Interesting reaction at a show today...
Hi,
At the Novemberfest show in Austin today, a gentleman
brought a 1960 
single cab pickup that he had &quot;chopped&quot; the top off of
- leaving the 
bottom half of the windshield and window frames
intact. He had 
fashioned slidebolt fittings so that he could put the
top back on in 
case it started to rain (which it did most of the
day).


---------I know its late but I just checked my mail. 
I had to vent a little as something like this happened
in my town.  First I hear from yhe local kids...&quot;hey
Aub  we know this guy with a bus he doesn't want it he
doesn't know what to do with it.&quot;

Of course I reply ...&quot;Tell him I want it!&quot;   wait it
gets worse.   First the kids didn't talk to him till
later that week.  Meanwhile this guy decided to cut
the entire roof off to make it convertible, taking the
metal to the dump(not even the steel recycler at
least).  When the kids saw it they said  &quot;Why did you
cut the roof off?&quot;   He tells them &quot;it is not worth
anything anyways.&quot;  They said &quot;your dumb Aub would
have bought it from you he wants another bus.&quot;  So
this dickhead is driving the bus every where and all
my friends are calling saying &quot;hey whos that new guy
driving around in the convertible bus?&quot; 

Don't worry it gets worse.  So one of my friends wants
a bus cause he hangs out with me so much.  He finds a
old ran down bus with front end damage.  I say  &quot;get
it.  talk to dickhead, and get the convertible, we cut
the front off the convertible weld it to the damaged,
talk all running parts bumpers and knicknacks to make
one bus perfect, and then try to find a home for the
remaining steel(no rust rokers and undamaged wheel
wells, rear end.  Perfect for some of you list
members).
Well dickhead doesn't want to give it up because
everyone talks to him at the store and gas station
now.  He started telling people he got it from someone
who rolled it because everyone said you shouldn't
have.  Oh the roof was damaged I guess its alright
then.  
don't worry it gets worse.  Iasked the kids about the
bus before he cut it.  They said this dickhead is the
schools auto shop teacher.  One of the alumni of the
high school donated the bus for free.  The dude kept
it because there was no reason to teach the kids about
air cooled stuff because it was failed
technology(argggghhhh) .....I know this guy was a
royal dickhead.  Turns out it was a baywindow
sunroof(worked fine what the kids told me)and after he
drove with the roof open for a while he decided he
wanted a full convertible.   It gets worse.


Remember my friend talked to him?  Now the dickhead
didnt want to give it up?  Yah, well the first rain
last winter when I broke my neck, he figures out why
VW designed it with a sunroof(to close and keep out
the rain)  He tells my friend he can have it for 3000
dollars.  Never mind its raining now, he cut the roof
because it was worth nothing, and he got it for free,
he drove it all summer and now he wants 3000 dollars. 
With the kids telling him he was dumb, my other friend
trying to get it even after it was cut for parts, and
all the new people he meet after driving it--He
finally learned it was worth something.  Now it was
sold to some businss man in town that was doing
deliveries this summer.  The floor was ruined as the
shop teacher left it out all winter.  The new owner
put seat covers on it and blew the engine during the
summer(remember it can't cool anymore since the top
scoops were completely removed) and the new owner
junked it at a crushing yard.  He didn't care it was a
business expense(write off the 3000 dollars).

Just another horror story that can help us put in
perspective our efforts, our hobby, and others.
