&lt;&lt; So would somebody...anybody offer me some advice on how to get started and 
exactly what to do in order to fix my front suspension!!! &gt;&gt;
Hi Pheonix,
First get a copy of the VW bus workshop manual now printed by Bentley or an 
original set if you can afford them.  Next study the manual, and see what 
type of standard tools you will need to buy.  Some tools are too specialized 
for the normal person to buy, and these operations can be done by shops 
instead.  In example rebuilding the king and link pins requires a large 
press, and many special fixtures.  So instead this part of your front end 
rebuild probably is best done by Wolfgang or Bus Boys.  
  Once you know what you are looking at doing you can ask more exact 
questions, and save yourself alot of troubles later.  Disreputible repair 
shops just love seeing a gal who understands less than nothing about her 
automobile, and thusly are all too often ready to rip you off.  Leaving you 
with a empty walet, and probably a automobile that is if not the same 
condition, then worse off due to poor repairs done to it.  So as we say even 
to male VW owners &quot;Best to learn how to do the work yourself so you know when 
good work can be or is being done to your VW or you can fix it yourself.  
Either that or marry the local best mechanic in your area so you can take 
he/she with you on your long trips!&quot;.     Eric&amp;Barb
