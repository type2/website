&lt;&lt; I noticed in this guys' post that he had the front beam only.....and 
perhaps at some point he would put in the rear and then again maybe he 
wouldn't.  I told him not a good idea....I had the fronts lock up in a panic 
stop before the rears did...ended up having to install a proportioning valve 
that was adjustable due to the system being a csingle cirquit.  What thinks 
you about that??? &gt;&gt;
Hi Steven,
What we have been able to figure out about disc brakes is that disc take more 
fluid amount to fill, and pressurize.  This means if the rear brakes are 
drums on a bus they are likely to lock up sooner that the discs up front.  
Thus the reason for the proportioning valve.  You want the front brakes to 
lock up before the rears no matter what or the rear tires apon locking 
essentially become a pair of posts sliding over the pavement.  This while the 
front brakes (Either discs or drums!) not locked will be slowing the bus 
down, and the bus becomes something like a pencil balanced on it's tip on 
your finger.  The front of the bus being the pencil tip, and the rear the 
eraser.  If the bus is not totally straight or brakes, pavement friction is 
not perfectly even from side to side the bus will do a 180 degree spin.  
  With the front brakes locking first (Which is why VW has made all there 
brakes bigger, and stronger in the front since early 1950s.) while the rear 
brakes keep turning, and slowing the VW they act more like a drag shute to 
keep the nose forward.  Eric&amp;Barb
