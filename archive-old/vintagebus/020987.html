&gt; the hazard triangle sounds good to me too- think I'll use that idea next time
&gt; I take the 53 on the freeway.

I was working on an idea for a list sticker along these lines like a year
ago. The bits are at www.type2_dot_com/~andy     scroll down. Anybody is
welcome to tweak or steal. I think I still have the photoshop bits.
I will mail them to anyone that want to work on it.
I thought (still do) that it would make a good list fundraiser.
