&gt; did anybody of you already shipped parts to germany??
&gt; I live in germany and want to buy some splitty parts in the USA via www.
&gt; Did anybody made some expierences with this?
&gt; What is the best way to get the parts to germany??


The cheapest way ship all but very large/heavy packages overseas from the
U.S. is almost always via U.S. Mail.  There are size and weight limitations
(which can vary by destination based on that country's postal codes), but
moderately sized boxes are usually not a problem.  (For example, I was able
to send a pair of front door interior panels,- which are pretty large
although relatively flat.)  Shipping via U.S. mail also avoids brokerage
fees, since they are included in the postage rate.  There are several
methods of shipping: surface parcel post (cheap but 4-12 weeks), air parcel
post (about 2-4 weeks, and often very close in price to surface), Express
air (several days; additional cost can vary greatly depending on
destination), and Global Priority (very cheap and fast, but only for parcels
under 5 lbs and not insurable).  Some larger post offices also offer a new
express service via a partnership with DHL, which I have not tried since
Perkiomenville, PA does not even remotely qualify for a large post office.
