Michael:

I have to concur with VanBondo, in that it's easier to install these two pieces first.  With the campers this would mean before the two rear birch panel pieces.  Rusty is also correct in that you wnat to make sure the track on the fresh air box is straight and clean, just like the tops of the front window frames for the scraper seal.

The other couple of tricks I know of are these:

1. Chamfer (sp?) or bevel the top side of the hardboard headliner pieces where they slip into the fresh air box track.  More specifically, the black, bare, unpainted side.  Right on the edge take a sanding block and carefully bevel that edge back 1/8&quot; or so, taking off only a tiny amount just to give the panel a bit more room.  Don't sand it down to the fisrt layer of painted paper.  Just take off a tad.  You want to be careful not to compromise that edge by making it too thin.

2.  Get a 2&quot; x 6&quot; and cut out a piece of wood with the same profile as the roof.  It doesn't have to be exact, just close.  Then place it against the back edge of the headliner panel a strike it with a rubber mallet, a tap at this side, then a tap at the other side.  Just keep working it from side to side, taking baby steps.  If you move it along too far on one side then it will bind and possibly pop out on the other side.

It should be a one person job, but is easier with two.  Get your wife, or a friend, to help guide the front edge while your pounding on the back with the rubber mallet.  Fortunately on the Westies, the back edge is concealed by the aluminum trim piece.  If you take your time you shouldn't mucky it up.

You also might want to throw some insulation up there before you proceed.  Keeps the temps in the bus more normal and helps keep the panel *pushed down* in it's proper position, instead of it's normal tendacy to pop up against the roof while you're trying to get it in.

Hope that helps.

Robert
