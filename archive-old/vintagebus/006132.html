So I pulled out my shift rod and reinstalled it cleaned it out and put
grease in it etc.. It seems to work OK - but I didn't do anything to adjust
it.  How would I adjust it.  First does seem a little strange - when I put
it in first it just doesn't seem to be there - no click or clunk or
anything - sort of like it is almost there but not quite - though first
works fine as do all of the gears.  I do know that is a there gear shift
adjuster extrodinaire on the list but how does he do it?

TIA
