A message from the lowly bus building population.

I think this is an absolutely incredible idea, and while I know it would be very
difficult to actually make it happen, you guys are on to something.  I would
love to see concours busses, that are actually judged and critiqued beyond just
what the owner says it is.

My vote is next years pre-classic OCTO.
