Hi Scott,
Crawl under your bus with volt meter in hand and remove the red wire to the 
solinoid.  Have someone turn the ignition switch to start position and check 
the voltage.  Take the voltage you are getting at the battery and minus the 
voltage at the solinoid to see how much voltage drop.  Next do the same at the 
coil to see how much voltage is getting to the coil.  
  If both results show little voltage drop, check the grounding cables for 
tightness.  Throw away any battery cables with those replacement bolt onto the 
cables, battery clamps or solder in new brass ones.  Still no luck?  Try 
replacing the battery.  Batteries require periodic dischaging and recharging to keep 
the lead plates inside from becoming covered in sulfur when stored.  Which is 
near impossible to remove after it happens.
