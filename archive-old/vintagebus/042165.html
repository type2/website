&gt; i am very confused by this.  in every vw official publication i've checked,
&gt; it says &quot;fill the engine with 5.3 pints&quot; oil. is this not 2.8 quarts???? (2

&gt; thus making it 2.8) or are my elementary mathematical elemnts out of whack?
&gt; i've been putting 2.8 quarts (leaving enough left to change the oil in my
&gt; oil bath air cleaner!) in my engines for 15 years, should i change to the
&gt; lesser quantity? will this make my busses lighter and help me go faster? 
&gt; no, seriously, it's 2.8 QUARTS for stock applications.  2.5 is how many
&gt; LITERS it takes to fill. or 4.4 imperial pints, whatever THOSE are! (lol)

I've found that if you fill a VW engine to capacity, it tends to throw the
oil out rather easily.  I put 2.5 quarts in the engine, use the remainder
for the air cleaner, and then save teh 1/4 quart or so that is left to put
in after 1000 miles or so when the oil gets to the halfway point.
