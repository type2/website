&gt; The noise is like a rattling or light scraping, maybe even with a tick 
&gt; which increases in tempo when I rev the engine with the clutch pedal down.

Hi Jason,
Did you check the TO bearing to be equally side to side in relationship to 
the input shaft?  

Someone suggested the pilot bearing? How can I check &gt; that? or a bent clutch 
&gt; disc?

Remove clutch pressure plate and disc to visually inspect that the tiny 
roller bearings are still in place and not torn up.  Grease lightly the sides 
of the tip of the inputshaft when installing an engine to automaticly lube 
these needle bearing.  It does not sound like that is the problem, because 
that would cause extreme shifting problems due to the clutch disc tilting and 
thusly always somewhat touching the FW and clutch pressure plate friction 
surfaces.
  For a bent clutch disc remove and place between centers on a lathe and 
measure with a dial indicator.  Generally though if that is going to cause a 
problem it also will cause extreme shifting problems due to the same reasons.
