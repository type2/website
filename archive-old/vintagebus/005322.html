&gt; Specifically I am trying to decipher the date
&gt; codes on the back of a speedometer. If there is a web site the explains
it,
&gt; please send me the link, or if you know off the top of your head . . .
Next to
&gt; a VW symbol is W 0.77,

This is the ratio for calibration when you are setting it/  checking it on a
speedo tester.


&gt;but there is also a 2,61 stamped on the back. I am
&gt; guessing that it is February 1961 Speedo, but I could be wrong.

I believe VW does it the same as Mercedes....by the week, not the month. If
so, this is the 2nd week of 61.

&gt;Here is the
&gt; part number too, if it helps at all: 211957023B (so the speedo is for a
Bus,
&gt; right?).

Don't know about the B speedo.......only C and D with the 211 957 023
number. Unless it is 211 957 033B........

&gt;If you could e-mail me directly I would appreciate it. Thanks for the
&gt; help.
