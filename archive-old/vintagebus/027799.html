Hey.... I got it... You could do like I seen my dad do with an old B John Deere that
was in the middle of a swampy wooded area. The trees that had grown around it, &amp; the
mud made it impossible to get out.... so Dad decided to fully disassemble it, piece
by piece, then we carried it out by hand:) I was only 12 years old at the time, but
the memory of draggin the block on my snow sled is burned in my brain.
 All ya need is a few hand tools, generator, sawsall, and some help... so what if its
pieces when you get it home... from what Ive seen, Thom gettin pretty handy at puttin
Splittys together again:)

&gt; The single cab  is up on the bed of a flatbed truck, which is on top of
&gt; who-knows-what.  It's about 10 feet in the air.
&gt;
&gt; There are large piles of stuff, very heavy stuff, in front of it.
&gt; three sides are completely overgrown with blackberries.  I know the terrain
&gt; underneath is not level, and it's impossible to discern
&gt; exactly what the topology is due to the overgrowth of blackberries.
