Subject: engine

Yesterday, I went out to where I have my 66 parts bus stashed. I wanted
to rid it of the bee colony before they got too active so I can pull a
few parts off of it. The story I got from the nice lady that gave it to
me is that her husband (now deceased) had planned on restoring it and
that he had dropped $1200 into the motor 20 years ago. I can't imagine
what he could have had done to it back then that cost that much and so,
was skeptical. But yesterday, I finally got to the engine compartment
and pulled the dipstick and the oil looks bright and clear!!! So now, I
am planning on pulling the engine. I wonder though. . . should I break
the engine down?? It is very apparent to me that it has been sitting for
a VERY LONG TIME!!
