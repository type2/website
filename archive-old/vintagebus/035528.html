What make and model is it?  

A cut up hacked up Panel into a Camper with no interior isn't worth as much 
as a Deluxe with no interior.  but interior is easily solved with a leather 
recliner bolted to the floors and some spray painted cardboard duct taped to 
the side.  

But i don't know rare a BUS is in canada but i expect pretty rare with your 
cold salty winters.  I really like that 60 kombi for $200 that 
i959kombi_at_aol_dot_com has i think thats who has it.  THATS a hella good deal!  
and IF you want it bad enough im sure they will hook you up they seem like 
nice folks.   Its not to hard.  You could even take some spare parts down and 
drive it up like that one nice Canadian girl did.  SOUNDED TIGHT!!!  Good 
Luck.  and  Don't worry you will find your Early.  my first car was a 72 
westy.  2nd was a 61 camper.  Keep on truckin and all that garbage.

oh yeah forgot to say.  I'm 18. and live in FL
