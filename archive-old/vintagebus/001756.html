Subject: Wiper motor blowing fuses
Date: Tue, 11 Apr 2000 13:26:56 -0400
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

I swear all I did was change the blades.

The old ones were shot so had little resistance, but since changed have
blown fuses in a short time (seconds). ANY ideas?? Was really looking
forward to Everybus this weekend, but is supposed to rain some and really
need wipers! What do I check?

Any help appreciated in advance.
