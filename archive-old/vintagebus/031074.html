Subject: What type of gasket sealer?

Hey folks,

I've been having a slight amount of grease (I suspect gear oil)
accumulating on the back of the RGB's and slowly working its way to the
rim and making spin art all over my rear rims.

Its not much, doesn't even make it to the ground.  Just enough to make
the dirt stick to the back of the RGBs and mess up my clean rims.  I'm
guessing this is where its leaking....could be the box halfs, but more
gunk on the backing plate than the boxes...hard to tell though.

I pulled the drums, brakes, seal carrier, and backing plate on one
side.  Both gaskets were in place and seemed OK.  The drain hole was
clear, but I did notice a small amount of crud (could have fallen in
there when I removed it).  I've cleaned mating surfaces and will put new
gaskets in, but I wanted peoples opinion on what sealant to use.  I was
going to use Permatex aviation non hardening (black stuff) since I have
a bunch of it and I used it a during the motor rebuild and the thing
doesn't leak a drop.   Should I use RTV to seal the backing plate
better?  Any better gaskets than the ones that come in a rebuild kit??

Thanks!

Steve
