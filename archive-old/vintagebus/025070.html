&gt; hey my name is mark and i have a 67 micro and i just got done taking
&gt; out the engine completely and took the gas tank out.  After puting in
&gt; a new sensor for the gas tank and putting the engine back in, I go to
&gt; start my bus and there is no gas getting from the tank through the
&gt; line and into the fuel pump.  What is goin on and what can I do to get
&gt; the gas up to the pump?  I tried to syphin (sorry suck at spelling)
&gt; the gas but it still wouldn't come through.  I am dumb founded.

clara gave you a great run down !but there is one other possibility.there is
also a screen at the bottom of the tank that can be changed,if all else
fails.        woody
