isn't there a velvet green westy on the samba with sliding door- dunno if =
the westy kit is from the factory or a later addition?

As I sit here (working hard) I was struck with a
question: Has anyone ever seen a Westfalia with either
a sliding door or double doors? I would guess that if
they do exist, they would be pretty rare or I am just
hitting the wrong shows!
