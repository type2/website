Subject: 36hp questions..

Hi everyone,.. I installed the 36hp this morning, and have a few questions,
-Would it be &quot;correct&quot; for all my engine electrical hook ups to be screw
terminal? including the voltage regulator?
-The accelerator cable doesn't seem to return, I think I may have kinked the
cable, is it possible to straighten it?
-I just rec'd my crank tin in the mail... Can I POR 15 it? or will heat be
an issue?????

Thanks in advance!
Michael Moore
