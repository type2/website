Subject: Re: [VB] Clutch Part numbers

There is NO such thing as a factory installed 78 1800cc bus engine. A
1978 USA bus came with a GE engine which is a 2.0L engine.
-------------------------- Clip ---------------------------
The problem I'm having is these postings are geeting crosss replies.
78 Bus Adjust valves, 66 Split Bus Clutch
66 Split window is completed.
78 I'll adjust the valves today.
I've read Tom Wilsons book and I know the 78 is supposed to have
hydraulic lifters ............. but it doesn't.
The owner was misinformed, it hasn't got the OEM engine.
