65 VW bus, new engine, extra parts.  559-452-8621  $1800/FIRM

I went down yesterday and looked at it. It's a solid, nearly complete Standard. Was velvet green, now primer. Only rust is in the front floors and battery tray. A few dents here and there, some bondo in corners, right rocker has a 6&quot; long scrape/dent, but is solid. Nose is pristine, front bumper is okay, has deluxe trim on it, no overriders.  Headliner has a few multi-inch rips and is yellowed. Blue front floor mat is in okay shape, no seat stand mats. Bench seat, comes with middle and rear, but the seat bars are missing. Most interior panels are there, but dingy. All 6 popouts are complete in good shape, one front window is cracked. New steering linkage. Engine was rebuilt recently, DP, short block done by reputable crankshaft machine shop in Fresno. Ready to drive away. The $1,800 is not firm according to Jose, the owner. He is not a kid. 
I've run out of driveway space and can't ethically drive it to Pomona to turn a $1k profit.
