Hi,
Now that I'm back on the road with my rebuilt and working reduction
boxes and new rear brakes my front brakes are giving me a headache. They
were new just three months ago, and given how much time my bus was up in
the air with the reduction boxes apart, they're just as new now. Anyway,
at that time I adjusted them and put in new wheel bearings and all was
kosher. I didn't do a thing to them but now that I'm driving they squeal
like mad when I'm moderately (normal) stopping. If I really stand on the
brakes it goes away. Today I took the wheels off repacked the bearings
(for my road trip to Utah in May) and I readjusted and cleaned up all
the brake stuff. I figured I'd be good to go. But noooo. There just as
loud now as ever. I know that on all the disc brake jobs I've done on
different model cars in the past they all have the anti-squeal metal
clips that you can coat with anti-squeal goo and they go on the backs of
the pads. Does the bus have something like that and I'm just missing it?
I've done more brake jobs than I can count and this one's got me
scratching my head. Everything appears to be in order. Any ideas? Thanks
again for your time.
