In my experience, especially whilst falling down long, steep, and curvy
mountain roads, being in neutral is detrimental to the stability of the
vehicle!  I stay in the highest gear appropriate to the velocity of the
vehicle, and use the brakes as sparingly as possible, allowing for them to
cool between applications.  The drag of the engaged engine seems to help
maintain the attitude of the suspension, so that when the brakes are used,
shifts of the center of gravity can be minimized...

&gt; Btw, it's illegal in at least some mountainous states to have the
&gt; vehicle in neutral while moving, particularly and specifically on
&gt; downgrades
