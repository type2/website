Actually, the way it works is very simple. The dairies and grocery stores
that own the crates don't do the milk crate police thing. They all formed an
association to do the dirty work. It isn't your local Krogers or Safeway or
whatever that is nailing your butt to the wall over the crates, wouldn't do
from a PR standpoint. It is the dairy case users association or whatever it
is called in your neck of the woods. The crates are returned to the
appropriate owners and the fines and prosecution are left to the crate cops.
No small deal, one of the big dairies here in Phoenix spends $300,000.00 per
year buying milk crates. You can see why it is worth their while to get them
back. Believe me they take it seriously. And the fact that the dairy is
defunct is no amnesty, the person that buys them at the auction has as much
legal right to them as the original owner. All of the crates from the
defunct Carnation dairy in Phoenix were sold to Adohr Farms in California
and they belong to them just as much as the ones with their name on them.
Handy as they may be, they do belong to someone and they may come to get
them.

&gt; I still have a couple of the good 'ol all-metal crates.  It'll be pretty
&gt; hard to bust me for them though, since the dairys involved are long
&gt; defunct!
