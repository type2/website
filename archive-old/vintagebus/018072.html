Subject: Barndoor speedo p/n?
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

Ok all...as the subject says, I'm looking for the part
number for a Barndoor speedometer.  I think I have
one, the part number is:

241 957 023

The strange thing is, it's stamped &quot;2/59&quot; on the case.
 There's also another letter/number combo (W .77), but
as previously discussed, I think that's the
calibration value or something like that.

I'd look up the part number, but I am not fortunate
enough to have a barndoor parts manual!

Thanks,
Paul
