Subject: Cargo door mechanism

Ever since I have had my bus it has been missing the latch mechanism from
the cargo door, I have got the two metal rods and the latch mechanism and
went to fit them last night.

Unfortunately the latch does not match up with my door.....  My bus is a 66
with the low hinge doors and the mechanism I have is the B suffix one which
according to the parts list is the later version.  The latch has the screw
holes diagonally in the two corners, whereas my door has the holes
vertically aligned...  Anyone seen this before?

My bus is a UK spec RHD kombi, however I don't think my cargo doors are the
original ones as they have mounts for pop outs which didn't usually come on
RHD buses and there is no M code on the plate for these.  However the mount
for the latch has been welded on so they may have been added by a previous
owner.

Paul
