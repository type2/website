The biggest problem why the
&gt;steering column stick to the steering wheel is that they are machined with
a
&gt;taper fit that practicly glues them together.  Eric&amp;Barb


Yah i removed the steering wheel on my 57 no prob....then i merely slid it
back on, no nut. 1 week later i came back to take it off and it was WELDED
on...i beat the CRAP out of the thing and it wouldnt budge. i literally
destroyed that POS wheel tryin to get it off. it finally just went *pop* and
off it slid......of course there was nothin left of the bakelite :)
