I have  an engine lid hinge w/ a broken pin, what is the best way to fix 
this? I  don't want to replace the whole hinge?

thanks
 
find a good hinge off a bus (up through 73ish)   and replace  it.   An impact 
whacker tool is useful.   apply penetrating  oil, tap impact tool.  repeat 
daily for a week.   grease threads  of the machine screws before putting them on.
