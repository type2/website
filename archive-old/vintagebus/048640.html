Check out what I did:

It's a real simple slap together kind of thing that REALLY works good. I've
used it quite a bit. I used scrap parts to make it. Don't ask details. Just
look at the pictures. That's all there is to it. I'm sure if you actually
planned a little you could make something much much nicer. But this at
least works...and works good.
