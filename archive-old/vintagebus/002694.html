hell

it happen that i got a B-pillar, passenger side from Motorworks, was ordered
before i thought of kelly at metalwizard, then today i cut my old B-Pillar,
now figured out to put the new one, but i notice small (big) difference ...
as the original one has the corner more &quot;square&quot; .. the repro has kind of
more round corner, then the place where the door rubber go isnt equally
solded to the repro as result that the upper door rubber slot dont fit
&quot;flush&quot; with the one on the bus...

hmmmmm now i think i understand why lot of people complain about repro sheet
metal, those small, but big difference make you work harder for fitting, i
thought at first all this was kind of plug-n-solder thing...

 The one i got has the bolting bracket for the cargo door, and the Dogleg
closeout all soldered in one pieces, it seem a hard job to reproduce this
thing!

Now are they brand name in this kind of repro think, or they are all made by
the same machine same places... how do you know when you order from place
like Motorworks or else that they have a good brand, not a cheapo one ??
