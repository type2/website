Subject: Re: [VB] cam questions

Hey Craig,
If you are looking for votes, I vote stock Web cam and whatever lifters
they want you to use.
I'd really like to hear how the aluminum case does.  I think I'd like to
try one some day.
I have the same engine (1679 single port).  I drove it to CA and back in a
67 with 4.12 big nut with 215 15 tires.  It dogged a little on the hills,
but would cruise 70-75 all day and runs cool.  I have it in a 3.88 small
nut now. I like it.  I'm driving it up around the Colorado border tomorrow.
I've flattened TWO of Berg's cams (GB309 and GB297) using all their special
stuff with their dual springs.  I'm using Web cam now and single HD
springs.  You might try some ratio rockers using a stock cam.
John
