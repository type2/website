Subject: T-SHIRTS - EveryBus &amp; Campers INFO

	Howdy, all...with EveryBus only a couple months away, it's time
again to pre-order t-shirts. This year I'm also doing commemorative dash
plaques as well, featuring the EveryBus artwork (about 2&quot;x3&quot;). I've got
artwork and pricing information up on my site
http://www.teamspatula_dot_com
on the t-shirts page. I've also got another new design, featuring all the
varieties of Westfalias, from splitty to Eurovan, which folks have been
asking about for years. Of course, the new TeamSpatula_dot_com shirts are up
as well. Orders must be received NO LATER THAN Friday, March 19th, so
don't wait too long. Don't forget every year the Everybus shirts sell out
within a couple hours, so don't be left out. Also don't forget that I
can pre-order children's sizes all the way up to XXXL, but I'll
probably only have L and Xl at the event, and not a lot of those. Drop me
a line if you have
questions. I also have a few of the Air Cooled Search &amp; Rescue shirts left
as well. Happy Friday!
