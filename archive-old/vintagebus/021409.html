&lt;&lt;  Was a twin side cover tranny with 3.88 ever available in the US?  Might 
save those looking for the lower R&amp;P a lot of grief if they were! (i.e. no 
hunt for 3.88 R&amp;P, splined 4th, or 8 bolt retained diff) &gt;&gt;
Hi Rob,
So far we have only found the stocker VW 3.875 R&amp;P in single side cover 
trannies here in USA.  Eric&amp;Barb
