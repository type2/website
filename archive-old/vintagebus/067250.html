Subject: re:frozen door handles

thanks for the advice...this is what i ended up doing. I took the door
panels off. got out my heat gun, and very gently heated up the mechanism. It
has been fairly dry here for the last few days, and warm enough today to
work on it.

Next I put some 3 in 1 oil on the mechanisms, moved them back and forth a
lot. The I put some grease on them-the idea being to keep the water out. Wht
I think has been happening is that water goes through the door, somehow gets
on the mechanism, then freezes there. So I need to keep the water out-that
is what hopefully the grease will do.

I also added some insulation to the doors. I had put some sound
deadener(peel and stick variety from mcmaster carr) on the doors last
summer. I had also put new door panels on last summer, with a plastic liner.
When I took the panel off, i noticed everything was in great shape, just a
little dusty/dirty. but it was all dry.

The insulation i installed is this stuff that looks like bubble wrap, but is
silver/shiny colored. This is kind of on the outside edge of the door. I
just squeezed it inplace, and made sure the holes on the bottom of the door
were clear.

Tomorrow I hope to put some insulation behind the front kick panels. And
also fix my horn which seemed to short out in this winter weather.

later
