&gt; I have already replaced all of the exhaust and and engine tin hardware.
&gt;
&gt; Skid
&gt;

Stainless fasteners used on the exhaust system will very likely seize
together. When you try to remove them, you will wish they were just rusted
mild steel fasteners. They will not yield to any off the conventional cures
for  rusted fasteners. They will be effectively welded (actually galled)
together and the only recourse is to drill them out or break them. BTDT.
