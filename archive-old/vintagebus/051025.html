Subject: RE: [VB] What exhaust should I use?

Look at the size of the muffler and tailpipe on a type 4 1.7 to 1.9. I don't
think that 1641cc is going to tax your stock muffler at all. Now if you're
running a 1776cc, I would consider an extractor. Face it, some people think
that 87mm jugs are a HUGE upgrade but in reality, they are standard
replacement jugs for rebuilders and they never think twice about the stock
muffler. Come back when you install 90.5, 92, or 94mm jugs. Then we can talk
restrictive exaust.

ya buy em books and all they do is look at the pictures !

&quot;I think that a stock bus muffler will have too much back pressure for my
1641cc. &quot;

Because a 1.6L motor is massive!  ROTFLMAO  

What carb(s) are you running?  The major limitation is the intake stuff from
my experiences and not the exhaust.  

I have to recommend a stock setup for a small 1641.  Look at the puny intake
and exhaust on the 1.6L Civics, small is okay for small engines.
