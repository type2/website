I knew it!!!!  But I won't say I told ya so.
Thom....it is easier if you begin now.
Begin what you say?  Begin buying those pieces one or more at a time
now...storing them for later use.  It's never going to get cheaper...plus
when you die think of all the people that will flock to your estate sale
to buy NOS repro goodies!!!!!!  :)
later
