Subject: RE: [VB] Weird Valve Adjustment

&gt;reground cam (web-cam), &lt;

With a reground cam the outer diameter is smaller than a stock cam.   Lift
can be higher than stock on the lobe side, but be &quot;thinner&quot; on the off-ramp
side.  Basically lift and duration/profile have nothing to due with the
outer diameter of the cam.  A lot of the V-8 cams are shallow re-grinds like
this, but with hydro lifters it really does not matter since manual
adjustments is not a factor. 

This could effectively cause the lifters to sit farther into the case due to
the narrower cam.  I would suspect at worst just a couple mm's.  Nothing
drastic or it should have been a &quot;used up&quot; cam where the hardened lobes
would have been worn through.

Of course it could be that lifters are shorter than normal as well... Or
just a combination of both scenarios compounded together. 

Granted WebCam has a great reputation so I doubt the cam is ground down too
much.


Hope this helps,
Adrian
