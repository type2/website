Hi Chris,
Check out the pre-1962 bus reserve switch.  Which was, and could be used with 
the stock cable for easy switching, and if hidden in the cab a great 
anti-theft device.  The BD reserve switches did not use a cable, but came 
with a fuel filter/water catch on the bottom of it.   Eric&amp;Barb
