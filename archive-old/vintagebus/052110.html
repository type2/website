Subject: Re: [VB] Any Lawers??????

Hi, I'm not a lawyer...BUT, I have plenty of
experience with trying to make worthwhile and fair
claims on damaged and near-totaled type2's. It wasa
&quot;mere&quot; bay-window ('71)...anyway, I was rear-ended on
the Jersey Turnpike by a semi doing about 90 and it
sandwiched my bus which had been recently restored to
showroom quality. It wasn't pretty (at all.) Anyway, I
did get the full appraised value of the bus handed to
me from the truckers insurance company. BUT, it was
not easy and took several months of constant research
and firm encounters with that company. I did not use a
lawyer and i would not suggest doing it...they will
take too much of what you need to get that bus back to
standard. Sorry, this is somewhat lengthy...but go
online and find every van you can within the same
&quot;age-range&quot; and in similar condition....print it out.
Find other classics in the same age-range and their
sale and appraised values and PRINT IT OUT. Contact
any reputable VW restorers or parts suppliers you have
dealt with and get a round-about appraisal for that
vehicle and have it SIGNED. Gather any pictures you
ahve of the bus as proof of it's existing condition
before the altercation...MAKE COPIES. Meet directly
with reps from the other peoples insurance, avoid
phone claim meetings....for sure. Anyway, for me, it
took a lot of struggle (A LOT) but it was well
worthwhile and landed me with the exact (if not
better) bus in the end. Persistence and (forgive me)
not taking any shit will make the difference. The more
info you have to offer and educated attitude about
your VW you can throw around, the better. There is
plenty of info and material available online that you
can access, no matter what the shape your bus was in,
that will help you. I don't recall or remember if you
left the area you are in, but e-mail me privately for
appraisal possibilities from a local
mechanic/guru/nice guy (license and all.) 
             sincerely,
                     jd wilson
