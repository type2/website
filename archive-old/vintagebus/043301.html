delete really good description of momentun mechanics
&gt;
&gt; So in this kind of terrain, I have gotten to where I just row thru
&gt; the gears and brakes are for correcting screw-ups . . maybe  :-)
&gt;
&gt;  When I look at it from the perspective of my diatribe above tho,
&gt; I think it is probably better to distribute evenly front to rear .
&gt;
&gt;  Unless you're a &quot;brake&quot; person . . :-)

less than the average big clunker, esp type 2's


only real answer, make sure your brakes are up to snuff, slow down, and
