Diana, 

Whoa!!

Before you do a complete tear down, do what Ronnie did.

Take it out, remove the shroud/generator, clean off the oil, run it for a
short while and find the leak(s)!  

**DON'T RUN TOO LONG WITHOUT COOLING**

It could be leaking jugs, leaky tubes, or bad oil seals..or even a crack in
the case...

Better to know what problem to fix the first time, rather than third time
down the road...

...been there, done that...will probably be doing again....

So..
I guess I have to start all over **SIGH***  
I'm going to use some RTV sealant on the cylinders this time, and try to get
the pushrod tubes straight.  

I'm still wondering about those shims that were in the old heads.
(circular,
metal, gasket-type things)  I didn't use any when I put it back together.  I
don't really see why I would need to, but...   Could that be part of the
problem??


Also, am I supposed to put sealant between the cylinders and heads as well??
