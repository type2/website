&gt; The set includes a VW Champer, Left side cargo doors,
&gt; longer than normal right side windows, a pop-top of
&gt; a variety I have never seen.  A RHD Golf, a 1300
&gt; Beetle with late model lights.  Oh yeah, check the
&gt; underside of the bus.  This is a real hack bus,
&gt; front engine, 4WD, muffler under the driver, and
&gt; tailpipe out the back.  The side doors have hinges
&gt; on the top &amp; bottom, not even on the sides.

    It appears that Maisto (the company that makes the R&amp;T models) bought the
original body molds from Matchbox/Lesney of England...  I have a NOS Matchbox
#34 in the original box from the late '60s and it is identical to the new R&amp;T
model (as far as the body goes).  The undercarriage of the Matchbox model has
no detailing at all, so Maisto did their own thing there. The &quot;hinges&quot; are
solid where the Matchbox actually has cargo doors that open...

    What's kinda neat is Matchbox came out with three different versions of
the Splittie Camper under the #34 model number...  A flat panel roof
&quot;Caravelle&quot; in a kinda puke green with green interior in the late '50s, a
silver Camper (with low raised roof, no windows) in the early '60s, and the
camper (again in silver) with high raised roof with side/front/back windows
in the the late '60s...  I have primo examples of all three...  The Maisto
version sits right next to them on the shelf and it fits right in...

    The Golf/Rabbit GTI is also a Matchbox in disguise...

    Now if R&amp;T/Maisto would only come out with the Husky SingleCab
&quot;commercial&quot; line, I'd be happy as a clam...
