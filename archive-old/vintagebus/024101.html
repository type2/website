&gt; I was recently going through the maintenance procedures, as in the idiots guide and have run into a few problems/questions.
&gt; 
&gt; I am working on a 1965 bus
&gt; 
&gt; As to the Transmission fluid change, I see two hex nuts on the bottom of the engine, I assume these are to drain the transmission fluid.  My question is where to put the new fluid in.
&gt;
The 17mm hex plugs are on the differential and the tranny, forward of
the engine itself.  Those are the drains.  The fill plug is identical,
except it won't have a magnet in the center, and is on the side of the
transmission, (right side, if I haven't forgotten), way up where you
can't possibly get a bottle of fluid above it. I use a piece of plastic
hose on the spout and squirt it in.  
 
&gt; Also while draining the oil, the pan was held on by a combination of acorn nuts(two of which were stripped leading to a real slow leak) and what I believe were bolts with 'acorn' type heads.  I thought that the engine should have had studs sticking out, that the acorn nuts screwed onto.  Is there some way to rectify this situation.  I think if I keep screwing these bolts in and out of the aluminum block I am looking for trouble(ie stripping).
&gt;
Yes, you will eventually strip them or worse.  You can get some more of
those little screw-in studs from a mail-order place like RMMW or WCM, or
maybe from a local FLAPS.  Put some of the light-duty loctite on when
screwing into the case, then get the new acorn nuts to screw on.  Should
fix it.  If not, the case may already be stripped and need either a
&quot;through&quot; bolt from the inside or an insert.
 
&gt; Any suggestions appreciated.
