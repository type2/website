Subject: An interesting bus story...

Lillian Meisenbach was a healthy 83 year old woman - alert, sharp as a tack,
and a very wealthy woman from playing her cards right through life.  She
lived 2 and 1/2 blocks from me and would often give me glaring looks as I
sped by on my chainsaw sounding moped or bug on my way to work in the
mornings.  She would often be outside doing old people things like old
people like to do that early in the morning like sweeping the sidewalk or
watering her lawn.  She never returned my smiles and waves but that's okay.
Lillian had been missing since February 6th and yesterday morning, a farmer
13 miles north of here was walking his dog down a dirt road and when he
crossed the bridge, there she lay face down in the creek bed - fodder for
the coyotes.  The blood stains found on the red interior of her rental car
pointed to foul play from the start.  Beatrice Nebraska's first murder in
over 12 years.

This evening, I got a call from Judith Noah who works for the Sherrif's
Dept. in Falls City, NE.  She's got a worn and slightly rusty 1967 bus for
sale that in all respects is in good shape for it's Midwestern age.  We
talked at length about her bus - she knows what she has and I so do I.  It's
a bus that can be a runner with very little work.  She parked it because she
couldn't find the gears and 40 miles after having the clutch replaced, it
started having the trouble again so it's been parked outside for over 3
years now.  The tires are sunk in the ground, engine bay is really clean,
and it appears that very little work would be needed to make it a runner.
It's painted white over red (my favourite color setup too!)  So now I'm torn
between getting my old white POS 66 going (I'm so close), or attempting to
get this bus (with it's better body) and getting it going.  I know the
rust-free nature of this bus is going to save me a lot of money in the
future and if you could only see the undercarriage of my 66, you'd probably
say to go with the 67.  But why is this bus in such good shape?  Judith told
me the following story:

&quot;My dad worked on Volkswagens for years but he eventually lost interest.
Dad had heard of some real nice VWs coming up on an estate sale in Missouri
so he went to the sale and bought the bus which was in really good shape.
The previous owner cherished his VWs and really kept them up well.
Unfortunately, he was murdered and his body was hauled away in this bus and
dumped.  The bus was used in a murder but I've camped in it and there is
nothing weird like ghosties or anything like that.&quot;

Now I'm not superstitious and I have strong religeous views on the
supernatural so it shouldn't really bother me but riding in a hearse is bad
enough - more or less a bus that is known to have been involved in a murder.
And with Lillian gone - man - what karma and vibes I had felt were just
about destroyed.  Despite all of this, I'm still running over to Falls City
to inspect the cargo floor and meet Judith in person.  If the deal doesn't
go thru, I'll post her info because the bus is available - just make an
offer she says (the antique dealer in her - which she is.)

I'd appreciate hearing any comments/opinions on this - what a werid crazy
situation...
