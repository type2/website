Thom---
I think the way to go from getting many previous responses to my quest is 
205/75/15, stiff sidewall (6 or 8 ply), and a narrow profile. Let me know 
what brand and the model you get and how you like them---I'm trying to gather 
info on tires for the earlier
(pre-63) rear wheel wells and how they fit!

Hope that helps a bit--
