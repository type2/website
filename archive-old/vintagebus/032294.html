&gt;me and my girlfreind both agreed this was one of the

&gt;raffle

heheh...yeah winning 4 times at the raffle would make ME feel that way too!

I had a good trip to OCTO too (although not THAT good Nick!). Met up with
the Stictly Vintage 2s caravan at 6:30am in Oceanside. We had an uneventful
trip to the show. The club booth got set up and I hit the swap with my $15.
There was the usual great assortment of vintage German metal there.

The best part of the show for me was when I was checking out this guy's EZ
Camper at the end of the day. I saw he still had the original (ugly
mettalic blue paisley) upholstery in somewhat decent condition. He made
mention that he was going to scrap it sooner or later and reupholster. I
let him know that I would buy the old stuff from him to help pay for the
job! I really don't think it's worth anything, but I want to make my EZ as
bone-stock as I can inside...

Met some new people...Finally got to meet Jennepher Barnes (Mrs. VW Planet)
which was cool. She filled me in on all sorts of FireBitch trivia which I
am sworn never to reveal heheh. Also, met this one guy named Patrick from
Riverside who seemed to be quite the guru. Met Harry Houck at the end of
the day too!

I'll get some pix up soon (hopefully)
