Subject: Desperately Need Carb Help before BBB IV!!
To: VintageBus_at_type2_dot_com

Im needing some help with my carb.  It idles high and drives fine but if i 
drive for awhile and let off the accelerator it dies before I come to a stop. 
 I have to restart it and then it Idles.  Seems the problem is the transition 
from throttle to idle.  Maybe clogged?  I checked it out and the &quot;squirt&quot; at 
the nozzle inside was fine but is there anything else to be looking for.  All 
jets are clean.  All seals and gaskets are new and perfect.  Had to boost up 
my idle RPM just a bit to keep it somewhat running.  everything I can see 
looks and seems to be working fine.  ??????
