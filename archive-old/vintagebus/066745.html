Subject: Re: [VB] cylinder studs sealant?

Pull the studs out of the case for the oil pump and then with the rear seal
removed use something to protect the case seal area and gently pry against
the case using the crank as a fulcrum point. Try doing this on both halves
at the same time. I have had to do this to slipt a case before. I used some
1/8&quot; hardwood plywood against the case to protect it and two long
screwdrivers. You could also use some heat along the case seam to soften the
grip of the permatex. Just warm the case! Make sure you got that hidden case
bolt that I know everyone misses at one time or another (I am guilty of that
one more than once....lol).
