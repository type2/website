A friend of mine (listmember) has a 1970 Dormobile bought in Italy by a 
US serviceman that had a lot of optional equipment installed... including 
power assisted (vacuum assisted) front drum brakes.  The bus came with all 
the original documentation, showing this as an original option.

&gt;When I needed a cable for the 68 I pulled one off the 69 and it was the 
&gt;same. Go figure!

Late '68 through '69 are the same.  Early '68 are indeed different, and 
both my '68s are early ones.  The rigid tubes from the body to the brake 
backing plates are different, and the late '68 through '69 ones will not 
fit on the early '68s (ask me how I know...).
