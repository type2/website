The Red Elvises!!  The bus folk down in Phoenix turned me on to these guys.  
They are the best Russian surf-swing-rockabilly band you will ever listen to, 
guaranteed!!  Check them out at  http://www.redelvises_dot_com  FYI &quot;I wanna see 
you Bellydance&quot; is the best CD to buy.  Warning, buy one and you will be 
hooked.

No connections with the group other than being a big fan.
