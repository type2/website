&quot;But this isn't a LIST topic.&quot; -- Sorry, I must disagree. 

While there isn't specific bus content in this thread, it is something
that is potentially VERY important to all of us as automobile collectors
&amp; enthusiasts. I have read the bill and passed my comments on to
enthusiasts in other fields that will be similarly concerned about this.
I would not have know about it if Bill had not cross-posted to the list.

[...]
But what about the guy with a 79 bus that's registered but runs poorly
because there's a fuel injection problem or engine needs a top end
rebuild.  Poor guy doesn't know much about working on cars so he goes to
his mechanic who tells him it could cost one to two grand to get it
running.  Says heck with this and takes it to the crusher and gets $500
to $1000. Not much incentive here to seek out some bus fan and sell it
to him for $400.

One less bus on the road.  One bus that never made it to the Pick and
Pull.

Personally, I, as a taxpayer, don't care to pay people to junk their
cars.  But this isn't a LIST topic.

&gt;&gt;I just did a quick read of this bill  # S.1766, and it seems that it
only
&gt;&gt;applys to turning in vehicles that are registered and operational, not
&gt;&gt;salvage yard units.
&gt;
&gt;...
&gt;&gt;Any comments?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;cal
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;yuh - folks with a running, RESTORABLE junky bus are gonna say &quot;$400
&gt;(typical payout in these bills) towards a camry? SWEET!&quot;
&gt;how those (assumed poor) folks intend to come up with the rest of the
cash
&gt;is never addressed.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;it does mean that some clunkers sitting 'out back' will be spiffed up
and
&gt;tagged just long enough to get the dosh, and scrapped.
&gt;not too many.  a far more serious threat are bills - usually local -
that
&gt;make it a crime to even HAVE a non-tagged, nonoperational vehicle on
&gt;property, even out of sight. some communities in texass even have
&gt;provisions allowing removal by sheriff w/ little warning to owner.
&gt;
&gt;believe me, if TEXAS passes sh*t like this (where a man can be legally
shot
&gt;dead for stealing HUBCAPS on yer proppity), y'all likely have similar
laws
&gt;a brewin.
