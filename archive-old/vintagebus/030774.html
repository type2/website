Campmobile is known as the model name VW gave to its dealer-supplied
buses with Westfalia camping interiors installed.  The name Campmobile
appears to be linked with Westfalia beginning in the late 1960s.  But
wait, there's more:

I have a reprint of an article from 'Hot Rod Special', circa 1963, which
says that &quot;now a series of six Campmobile kits are available to be
fitted to existing panels, Kombis, and wagons&quot;.  Could there have been 2
different Campmobiles?

More from the article:

&quot;The T-500 kit is one of the most interesting because it is designed for
the panel truck.  Listing at $530, it consists of 5 gear-operated and
screened safety glass windows, small but adequate for light and air when
they are installed in the solid body sides.  Additionally, there is
complete ceiling and side-wall birch paneling; seats which unfold to
form a double bed; vinyl floor covering; folding table with extension
leaf; two side-door shelves; clothes closet with mirror on door; two
wall-mounted electric lamps; six foam rubber cushions covered with vinyl
or nylon fabric; food storage compartment; soil resistant window
curtains; magazine cabinet; 3 floor-level storage cabinets with drop
doors; and a hidden storage compartment behind the driver's seat.

A deluxe kit for the panel truck is the T-400, priced at $730.  It is
the same as the T-500, but it adds a cabinet housing, a 50-lb ice box
and a 14-gallon water storage tank with chrome pump and swivel spigot; a
two-burner gas stove; and a chemical toilet.

The T-700 kit is for the VW station wagon and is identical to the T-500
except that it is without side windows and interior paneling which are
standard equipment on the wagons.  The list price is $465.

Moving along, the T-600 is the deluxe kit for station wagons, and it
matches the T-400, less side windows and interior paneling, unneeded for
wagons, at $570.

There are two kits for Kombis.  The T-900 is $465, is the same as the
T-500 less side windows.  Finally, the T-800, the deluxe kit, is
identical to the T-400 less side windows.  Price:  $690.

There is a list of optional accessories for the Campmobile kits that
will permit the prospective outdoorsman to rough it in even greater
comfort.  A roll-up awning tent (and roof carrier) providing a 6-by-6
foot enclosed 'room'  is $88, while a free-standing 8-by-8 foot cabana
tent with roof carrier goes for $125.&quot;

Also mentioned in the article are other accessories for the Campmobile
line, including a front seat hammock for $10, a 25-gal shower unit for
$47, a canvas shower enclosure for $17, a 'sun deck' with ladder for
$105, and a roof-mounted self-enclosed 'Campette' pack allowing up to 4
to sleep on the roof.  (Picture of Campette is included in the article
and it looks pretty cute.)

The article does not say who made the Campmobile kits or whether they
were available directly from the VW dealer (I suspect not).  Hope this
helps!

&gt; Recently enter a '58 &quot;Campmobile&quot; found in Arkansas with the tell-tale
&gt; picture window and an interior that mostly matches mine in all the
&gt; important places.  Does anyone have *any* information about the Campmobile
&gt; line?  Where they were based at the very least?  I mean, I love my camper
&gt; and that's what matters first and foremost, but I'd at least like to tell
&gt; people about what I have and be accurate about it.
