&gt; I read the proposed bill modifications in question and this guy has

I read it too,

the text is at:
http://www.leg.state.or_dot_us/99reg/measures/hb3200.dir/hb3217.int.html

The bill itself is contradictory though... in one place it says this:

prohibits department from
registering any motor vehicle manufactured before 1981 unless it
is antique or vehicle of special interest or meets certain
emission standards.

then later it says it applies to only previoulsy totalled vehicles.

I for one dont do antique registration currently because of all the
limitations and hassles, i just register my busses/vw's as regular cars.

If my state forced me to go through special hoops because i drive an older
car, i'd be a bit upset.  But if all they required was an emission
inspection, that wouldnt be so bad, though i'd rather avoid it. (i keep my
cars in tune, i'd probably pass)

But does anyone really want the state to decide if their rusty old bus is
of special intrest?

peas,

Steve
