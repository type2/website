Subject: RATBASTARDS

I know I have made a few posts before concerning the twin towers event.
And I am trying not to post about it anymore. Yet, I heard a most
disturbing report today. Very disturbing. So disturbing that I think
everyone should be aware of this, not just listees. A reporter in
Pakistan was in one of the wacko religious schools there and all the
students were in a celebratory frenzy. And they announced that OUR
CHILDREN are next. That they are going to bring their JIHAD to our
SCHOOLS!

Now if anyone doubted that these folks are RATBASTARDS before, they
should understand just what this country is facing. And while before I
had great concern to protect the innocent over there, I am less
concerned about that now: the innocent of this country are of greater
importance. I hope our military stikes these radical training schools
preemptively. One student held up a picture of the Sears tower in
Chicago and said &quot;this one is mine&quot;.

Scary stuff.
