have you tried putting it in from the other end?

otherwise, see if you can find someone with an electrical snake (for
pulling wires through conduits) and string that through, then tie a
string to the other end, tie it to the line and pull it..

or, try and spin the cable while your putting in.. just don't tweak it
too hard.. also, put alot of grease on it and in the tube..

hope that helps..

later,
MIke

&gt; this poor girl running before the High Country Bus Fest. New engine in, all
&gt; new fuel lines, fresh seals, then this. I do not even know if it will start.
