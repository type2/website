the electric wiring was changed  to the push on connectors from the screw on 
connectors at VIN 614 456

okay,  dig deeper
 
10 feb 60, ch 569 929 

fuse block beside fuel tank  -
 Now: two fuses for low beam totalling 8 fuses in box.
  Formerally: 6 fuses in box

 your buses would come with a screw termiinal 8 fuse fuse box.   Sound 
fitting?  but what is this fuel tank bit?

see also

Fuse Box
Now: transparent 8 point fse box under parcel shelf.

hm, looking at other book, there is a fuse box w/8 fuses for buses up to vin 
614 455,  part# 211 937 035,
the 8 fuse fuse box from 614 456 is part# 211 937 037

so hope this helps.
