Subject: OT:  Getting a Ghia

I know this is the bus list, but I'll ask anyway.   Im going to look at a
convertible ghia this weekend for my wifes birthday.  Ive never owned one
before so im not familiar with the typical trouble spots like I know to look
for on a bus.  What are some of the things I should be sure to check out and
what are some questions I should be asking the current owner?

My wifes wanted one of these since she was 16 so I'm hoping to suprise her.
On the other side, maybe she'll finally understand why i spend so much time
on my 2 buses! :)
