Subject: Fw: [VB] Sundial Campers

Subject: Re: [VB] Sundial Campers


 I always wondered why my interior seemed so much darker than others I've
 seen. And to think I thought about redoing it in a lighter shade. Here's a
 link to pics of our 66 sundial which also appears to have never been
 modified.

&gt;  &quot; Choice of light or dark wood interiors.&quot; &quot;
&gt;  Take a look at Mike Alcorn's (listee) Sundial sometime.  The exterior has
&gt; a
&gt;  few non og pieces...but the camper interior is simply beautiful.  One of
&gt; the
&gt;  only perfect examples of the dark interior Sundial offered.
