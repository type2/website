I think that Jim is referring to the brass bracket that can be seen in the pic you referenced as items &quot;A&quot;. Mine was gone when i got my bus nad I found a very similar brass facsimilie at a local hardware store.

As Scott said there should be a brass sliding latch at the base of the drivers side of the seat(near the plug outlet).  Additionally, there is the piece you are referring to.  It keeps the seat attached to the drivers side bulkhead.  The rod/clip you speak of should be threaded on one end and have a black Bakelite knob threaded on to it.  There will be a hole in the bulkhead that the rod goes through.  Attach the clip to the seat bracket(screwed to the inside of the seat upright I think) and snug down the knob from the drivers side of the bulkhead.  This secures the seat from moving backwards.

Here is a link on Everett's site:

I don't know why yours is &quot;L&quot; shaped.  Possibly bent?

On the bottom of the seat there is some kind of weird mount type
thingy. It's sort of  'L' shaped that's round on one end with notches in it
