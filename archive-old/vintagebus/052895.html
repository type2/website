Subject: Re: [VB] Bessie--Limited Edtion Matchbox Bus

Hi Jerry and Melissa

Just wanted to let you know that the two 'Bessie' buses arrived today, and
they are great! Thank you for having them made, I love them!



&gt; Here is the other Limited Edition Matchbox bus that we had made.  It's a
&gt; replica of our hippie bus &quot;Bessie&quot;.  The pic shows both sides of the bus,
&gt; which are each different.  If you would like to purchase one (or two) of
&gt; these, the price is $15.00 each including shipping within the USA.  You can
&gt; pay by check or money order. If you want it right away, please send a money
&gt; order, I hold orders paid by check for 2 weeks from the date I deposit the
&gt; check in my account before shipping. Send payment to:
&gt; Melissa Jess
&gt; 3121 East Yucca Street
&gt; Phoenix, AZ 85028-2616
&gt; Here's a link to a picture.

&gt; Here's a link about our bus &quot;Bessie&quot; if you'd like to look at her.
