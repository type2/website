&gt; Hey Y'all,
&gt; I bought this old &quot;Dixco&quot; timing light at a yard sale for a couple of bucks
&gt; but I dont know how to use it. Apparently it is not an inductive light. On the
&gt; end of the wire where an inductive pick up would be, there is this metal
&gt; spring-like thing attached. Does anyone know how to use this kind of timing
&gt; light?&gt;

&gt; Taking a wild guess here, but I think you put one end on the end of the

&gt; You effectively &quot;tap&quot; into the lead.  That's at least how my Dads old
&gt; light (60's  Craftsman I think)used to work.

John,

Steve is absolutely correct, with one caveat.... use this light only after
sunset! :-)  These lights do work and reasonably well, but they are
anything but bright.  The reason is that they draw all their power from
the spark wire itself.  They are brighter than the spark you see on a
spark plug, but not a whole lot.  As John said, pull the wire leading to
the #1 plug from the distributor cap, push one end of the spring in to
replace it, then push the lead to #1 onto the other end of the
spring-thing.  If you look at the spring closely, it has a male and female
end to allow this.
