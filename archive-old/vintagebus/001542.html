I don't know of the Crestline MFG but I can say &quot;Cool, old busses with
vintage wheels!&quot;

I found an old set of EMPI two piece 5 spokes that I'm putting on my '59
double cab... going for that 'vintage custom' look....  BTW, anybody got a
set of center caps for those?


Anyway Greg, good luck with your wheels.

Dave

I picked up a set of 5 spokes to put on my CrewCab (Bus Content)
and I'm wondering if anyone can give me some info on them. On the
back they say Crestline MFG. INC............Mark
II..............Walnut Creek Calif. Not your typical 5 spoke I'm
sure, but just wanted some more info on them. At any rate they
should look good on the Crew once they're cleaned up.

Thanks in advance,
Greg
