Subject: RE: How to rebuild engine video


&gt; Rex and other Volks,
&gt; 
&gt; For the second time in a single day, mention has been made of 
&gt; getting a shop or someone professional, to do something, for a beer 
&gt; or two.  What do we do if we don't drink!!!?  Somehow a Coke or A 
&gt; Dr. Pepper just doesn't cut it!
&gt; 
&gt; Curt
 
 
I don't drink beer either. Maybe they will work for food? remove/install
flywheel + help set end play = Taco Bueno?
