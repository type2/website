Subject: RE: [VB] VIN Woes

  At our MVD here in Havasu the best time to go is in the hottest part of
the day. They don't like coming out in the heat so the ones  (people) I have
dealt with come out, I open the engine lid and read them the number and they
go back to the air conditioning and give me my title without a problem. In
the winter it's a different story, they like it when you come between their
breaks so they can come out and have a smoke. Of course they are so used to
me and VW Howard that they take our word on most of the buses we get titled,
Oh the system.

Nothing like this happened here in Illinois unless I just walked in there at
the right moment....
when registering the 64 all I had in my hand were documents that said that
the Bus has been bought
at the auction with no title. God title and registration with no problem....
and they have not even
looked at the Bus.... not even from a distance. Sometimes I just wonder
about some of the City,
State or Federal employees...

These
