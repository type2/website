Subject: Re: [VB] Keeps eating wheel bearings?

Markus,

When you're banging out the old races and banging in the new ones, be
extremely careful not to let them tilt in the holes. Bang evenly all
around out and in, no excessive hits, and no hits to the brake drum
itself. They crack easily - I know. You can use grease to lube them on the
way in. You'll hear when they seat fully. Don't put them in upside down!

I've used large sockets to help drive them in.

Also check that the outer bearing spins freely on the spindle, going on.

&gt; I agree with George that the bearing races may have been incorrectly

&gt; but also easy to get wrong if you do not appreciate the issues at hand.
&gt; The races need to be seated all the way down in their holes.  Leave a
&gt; gap here and things will not work.  Good luck.  You do need to do this
&gt; job over.  Roller bearing!  Try doing the older ball bears.  Fun too!
