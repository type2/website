Hi Ken,
It kind of depends on what HP you are getting out of your engine and what RPMs
are running right now.  If you are thinking of running it without reductions
and only the type 3 axles you will only have one bearing on each rear wheel
instead of the stok three bearing and even the post-1967 two bearings.  Not a
good idea for longevity and safety.  Suggest you check out the Archives for
more info.  Due to tranny, lowering and wheel talk is not allowed on this
list.    Eric &amp; Barb
