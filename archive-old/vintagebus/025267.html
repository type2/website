I went to Bad Camberg the last time---flew into Frankfurt--rented Audi
stationwagon-this gives you space AND a place to sleep,on wheels! --this
time it will be differant for me as i will fly to London--then VW
caravan to BC with my English friends--the VW caravan at this time is
about 10 assorted VWs--Then VW caravan back to England--If you can, do
the Karmann Museum!! well worth the trip--Also the VW Museum--at the
last BC event
we were taken to the basement of the Museum by some friends for a sale
on VW Stuff--a costly trip indeed--but worth it!! BC will be aglow for a
few days prior to the event--This is the time to meet VW friends from
all over the world--Several vintage VWs will already be there--Bulli
Kartei will of course be putting on a display of Driven Vintage
buses.--What ever you have seen in VW books in the way of vehicles you
will see driven to this show--I enjoyed the food and friendship of the
town of Bad Camberg--Not only will you meet friendly German VW
Friends--but VW friends from all over Europe who have driven there. Plus
VW people from all over the world--as Americans we must be on our good
behavior, this is most important as to the image we project. If this is
your first time abroad please show respect for another culture--If you
have been there before, than enjoy the event for what it is - A true VW
Driven Vintage display--Willi Lottermann and his wife are a most
wonderful couple--hopefully Willi will have his health back.. I will try
to answer any questions--I have only been there once before--for some
others it is their 3rd, 4th. time.  If you know of anyone who has been
there --please ask them for any help--UJ
