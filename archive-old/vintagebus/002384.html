Subject: Cyl. 3 &amp; 4 not firing well

Hi List, I need help please. My 63 DC has a 1600 DP with approx. 2700 miles
on it. I did have dual Webers, but I could never seem to get it to run well.
It seemed that more times than not that cyl. 3 &amp; 4 weren't firing or at
least not very well. I thought maybe it was due to the dual carbs, not in
sync and all. So today I changed over to a stock single carb, brand new one.
To my delight it ran better than it ever has. Smooth, responsive, powerful,
etc. I thought, &quot;They were right!! Just a dual carb thing!&quot; I drove back to
my house from the shop where we worked on it, about 55 miles. When I pulled
in the drive it seemed to be idling rough. I checked and sure enough, those
same two damned cyl. were barely firing. In the past few days, in addition
to the already mentioned carb thing, I have put in new plugs, wires, dist.
cap, points, condenser, etc. I think the only thing I have not replaced is
the rotor. I've also checked the valve adj. All valves are set correctly.
Does anybody know of anything else to check?? I've run out of ideas and it's
driving me crazy. It makes no sence to me that those two cyl. work perfectly
sometimes and sometimes not. Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks, Pete
