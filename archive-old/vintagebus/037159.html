&lt;&lt; On the way down here &quot;Pumba's&quot; starter gave hassles when hot.  Either a 
rolling/push by Gayle start did the trick or a tap on the starter with a 
hammer worked too.  &gt;&gt;
&lt;&lt;Sounds more like dirty or bad battery cables to us not a bad starter.  A 
bad 
starter will cause troubles wether hot or cold.  Not just when hot when the 
engine needs the most HP out of the starter due to the warmed engine with 
higher compression than when it is cold.&gt;&gt;

Connections will get you hot or cold ,,but only hot tends to point to a 
starter going south more than likely. Been there did that on Vw's ,and 
Amercian Iron also. I met this guy at HCBF and his wife very cool folks ,and 
i think he has enough mechanical sense to ck the connections. On my thing i 
have a bad connection hit the switch nothing push it outta the way ,then hit 
it it starts,,, thats a bad connection ,plus i cheated hooked hand starter to 
the starter fired it up ,then it cranked till it rained , now thats a 
connection problem. Hopefully tomorrow i can remedy that ,,later
