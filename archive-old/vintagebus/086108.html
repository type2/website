Subject: Re: [VB] Tuning new Kadrons for the '67 Westy.....

Sounds like you need bigger main jets. You'll probably need to get a few 
sets of different sizes so you can increase the size a step at a time 
until you find the ones that make the engine run smooth. Don't try to 
save money on gas by running smaller jets. My mileage got better when I 
got my dual Webers set right by increasing the main jet size.
