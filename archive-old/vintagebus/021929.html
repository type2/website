Message-ID: &lt;2a62b5bc.24b3cf36_at_aol_dot_com&gt;

i cleaned the tag up and i wrongly stated that it was made on 2/ 62
It wass actually made on 2/65 (thats what the tag said)  I also read SO-42 on 
it but couldnt earlier because it was so nasty.
(are SO-42's &quot;rare&quot; or the more common type?)
?
What do you guys think i should do w/ the cargo area of my 59' panel? Im 
obviously going to paint it a primer grey, but, Id like to use it as well 
(camping etc.)
Other than the cargo area it is gonna be totally stock. Would it be 
sacreligious to put that interior in it? I have a cab divider (thanx eric &amp; 
barb) that will make this area almost invisible. What do you think?

thanx
