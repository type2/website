  I am posting this for a friend.  He is looking for the bracket that mounts 
 on the front bumper that holds the westy tent pole for the years 1959 thru 
 1964.  You can email him at :  transrest_at_aol_dot_com.
  &gt;&gt;

actually the front bumper tent mount bracket is also used later- my 65 westy 
came with it.  Think they used it on the tent with the roof brackets, until 
they went to the sliding bead piece on the tent.  but this is just dribble, I 
don't have any extras.  I could, however, get a picture taken of mine and 
email it to Douglas, sure I can borrow a camera, don't think it would be 
tricky to fabricate one.
