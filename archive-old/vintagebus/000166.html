&lt;&lt; This is really gonna be a stretch of the &quot;bus content&quot;. . .
 
 but are there any bussers from New Zealand on the list and are they
 experiencing any Y2K problems yet.
 
 My wife asked me to do this (disclaimer) and since she is a reluctant
 bus owner, please don't flame me for this :)

After all it is Friday and it is always good to hear from an old fashioned 
couple where the man is the head of the house.  I am the head of my house.  
My wife just runs everything in it and me.
Happy New Year

PS Did anyone in New Zealand have any trouble?
