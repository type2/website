Except WCM kit consist of a pop rivet and cardboard washer, if you even get
them, unless they changed them in the last few weeks. I have gotten the
correct pieces from WW. I did go to the nut and bolt store  today and they
had the rivets in aluminum and stainless, solid and hollow and Radio Shack
has the fiber washers, a lot of leg work for a 2 dollar part.
