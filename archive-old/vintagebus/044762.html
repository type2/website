Busses came with the brake light decklid and the bubble taillights up to 
chassis #246 963 in April  of 57.  then they switched to the flat round glass 
taillights that include brakelights and the flat decklid.

If you have access to an VW Parts List (from VW, not from some other company, 
though actually WW is really good at listing changes in their catalog)) and 
look up the part, it will tend to list what chassis number it was used from 
and to.  Though some parts get superceded,

&lt;&lt; Have been getting some conflicting information in town about when they 
 changed the taillights from bubbles and removed the taillight from the 
 decklid.  Some have said that the taillight was carried over into very early 
 58 but i am skeptical.  Anyone have any idea?  Looking at my 57 dlx i notice 
 that the decklid is indeed a non brakelight with a brakelight hacked into 
it! 
 :(  So does anyone know tha approximate chassis # which this change occured? 
 
 Just trying to get the bus back the way it should be
