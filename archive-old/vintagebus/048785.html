Subject: Weekend flea market stop...

NQ's post reminded me of my quick flea market experience this past 
weekend. Last week the local Eur-Asian shop owner had mentioned he 
saw the front of a splitty bus at the little local flea market. So on 
Sat. afternoon when my wife decided to head into town, i tagged 
along. We made it out there at 5:00 PM just as the places were 
closing up shop. As well pulled around to park my wife said, &quot;there 
it is....it's yours!&quot;  Not too much to my surprise, there sat the 
front end of a bus I took to the local metal yard about 3-4 months 
ago. Now, before anyone gets excited, this front end was made up of a 
LOT of bondo. And the window frames were nice and rusty as well. But 
what they got it for was an art piece I believe. I told one of the 
'ol boys running the place the story and they loved it. They were 
already passing it along as I walked off. Their favorate part was 
that I got $9 for the whole shell and this fella was selling the 
front end for $100! I paid $75 for the bus and made about $500 off of 
parting it out as well as getting a lot of stuff for my own busses. 
So that's cool. It's just funny to me 'cause I ALMOST cut the nose 
off to make.......something out of it. I was really just trying to be 
good and get rid of some junk. You know what they say...one man's 
junk....another man's treasure!
