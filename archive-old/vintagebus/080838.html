Subject: Stuck RGB Halves

Two weeks or so ago, I tore down the second of my two RGBs.  I noticed 
that the cases were reluctant to separate but didn't really think anything 
of it until 2-3 hours later when I was ready to clean up the outer (wheel 
side) case half and put the new bearings in it.

That's when I realized what had hung up when I was separating the case 
halves.  The top bearing appeared to have been stuck in the RGB half and 
when I forced the halves apart, the circlip broke, leaving the bearing 
stuck in the RGB half.  An hour and a half or 2 hours later (playing with 
a torch and a dremel), I was no closer to coaxing that bearing out of the 
RGB half and I gave up.

Last weekend I picked up a spare tranny with RGBs (I had wanted a spare 
set of RGBs anyway) and thought I'd just grab the outer RGB half off that 
tranny and be on my merry way.  

Tonight I made to pull that outer RGB half and found it hanging up after 
separating about a 1/4&quot;.  I'm not real anxious to repeat my previous 
performance and end up with a less than useful RGB half shell.  Does this 
sound like the same problem I experienced before?  Thoughts on how to 
proceed?

The rub is that my &quot;spare&quot; tranny is a small nut tranny and half-rebuilt 
one is a big nut tranny.  &quot;Informed people&quot; told me that the outer RGB 
half was interchangable between the two, otherwise, if I had a couple of 
small-nut brake drums, I'd be installing the spare...

Any ideas would be appreciated.

Thanks,
	Tom
