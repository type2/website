&lt;&lt; Hi All,
 Anybody have an idea where the original placement for a speaker (s)
 was/where in a '59???
  &gt;&gt;

under the dash grill to the right of the radio.  They came with a bracket 
that holds the speaker, bracket screws to the under side of the dash, you can 
see the holes there for the speaker bracket if you look.
