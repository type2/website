&gt; I was asked by a friend about the box in this photo:

http://onearth_dot_com/images/westybox.jpg

&gt; Does anyone know what it is? 

That box contains a cooker. Not an original westfalia item at all - the
interior of that bus was completely refurbished by a very talented
carpenter. While he was doing it, he made the cooker box to fit in with the
rest of the interior. The cooker it contains has a lift-up aluminium shroud
round it - like the ones Devon used for their conversions here in the UK.
