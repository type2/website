Subject: Transaxle Thanks-Front spindles q?

Everyone,
Thanks for the great info on tranaxles for my Bus. I placed a call to 
Rancho, and they gave me a great qoute on a new trans, assembled from 
redux box to redux box. I have decieded, based on their advice, to go 
with a 4.12 67 ring and pinion, since I am planning on a basically stock 
1600 SP, with only a CW crank as fancy upgrades go. I live in area of 
stop and go traffic, some highway driving, and hills to climb, so they 
steered me away from 3.xx ratios due to the small motor.
I am faced with shipping them the 'virgin' tranaxle I have to retrieve. 
I plan on building a crate for the unit, maybe even one they can use to 
return it to me. Any ideas how to ship this thing? Must I search out a 
company to do it, as I assume Fed ex, ups, usps, etc are ridiculous 
notions due to size and weight? I have a pickup so I can bring it to 
some hub or company, but don't know if CF or other trucking cos are the 
way to go, any ideas? I figure the turn around time will allow me plenty 
of time to run new control cables, check shift rods and perhaps some 
undercar painting.
I finally got a spring plate compression tool, threaded rod kind, hope 
that's the ticket to remove the lowering plates, and install stock stuff.
Are the front spindle sgoing to be a bear to do, assuming I get rebuilt 
ones with link pins installed already? I must get rid of these nearly 
new lowered ones, as my bus will be nose diving when the rear is 
finished, sometime in August I hope...
Much appreciation to all,
AL
