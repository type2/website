Actually, you do. Because the stock heater blows air into the cabin for
heat, obviously it needs some way to get out. If you crack a window open it
will allow the heated air into the cabin easier and allow for more volume.
This assumes that a million leaks aren't already providing plenty of space
for the air to get out of course. You aren't wasting heat by opening a
window, you are helping it.
