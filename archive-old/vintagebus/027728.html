Hi James,
You need to drill holes in the metal tops or bottoms of those paper air 
cleaners and plumb in a hose from carb to carb.  Somewhere between the carbs 
install a Tfitting for the breather hose to attach to.  This will allow the 
engine to burn off oil vapors and any gasolene that has made it's way past 
the rings which will increase your MPG.   This will help not only help your 
engine but the enviroment!
