&gt;if you ever have a chance to go to the VW Design studio in the L.A. area an
&gt;emplyee there has the same set up your talking about, 911 power and a 5
&gt;speed, problem is he has to back off at 110 mph because the bus starts to
&gt;float, unsafe at any speed?


i think ground effects would come into play here, but certainly have little
effect at lower speeds. the only place around here where you can go that fast legally
is on a race track, but the kind of power i'm looking to use would be for acceleration
on the freeway, passing maseratis and such...
there will be some attention to basic suspension modifications, like late bus sway bars.
the early bus camber compensator for the swing-axle trans  is used on track for vintage
356 racers... my late bus  w/ sway bars and 911 engine just doesn't make my nose
bleed any more from the G-forces...
