Subject: Barndoor Puzzle...long

One last what I got for Christmas post:

I know its not Friday, but there is bus content.

I received a very cool wooden puzzle with an early (no rear bumper)
barndoor bus on the front, and was wondering if any one had seen one
like it before.

Its about the size of a small plaque, 10&quot;X12&quot; and made out of wood.  The
puzzle is in relief (I think thats the correct term) that is, the puzzle
pieces sit up about a 1/8&quot; from the base.  The pieces are about 1/4&quot;
thick.

The puzzle is silk screened and resembles the very familiar VW delear
signs.  The blue ones that were a vertical rectangle and said something
about &quot;Service&quot; or &quot;Parts&quot;.  This puzzle is two distinct parts, one is
the V over W logo (two pieces) and below it is a Barndoor panel bus in
3/4 front view, comprised of 6 pieces.  The bus is colored a very
strange light orange on top, faded to dark orange on the bottom, with a
black roadway on the bottom.

The only markings on it are printed in the lower right hand corner.  The
words KDF Enterprises (I suspect the manufactur) are below a round logo
with the old cogwheel VW logo and the words Kraft Durch Freude (joy
through work??).  

Any one seen anything like this?  My mom said she found it in an antique
shop somewhere.  Jerry &amp; Melissa, any guesses?

Thanks for the info!

Steve
