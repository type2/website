Hey all,

Thanks for the replies thus far!  So what does the lock plate look like..how 
is it shaped.  If I remember correctily the lower rear most bolt had a lock 
washer.  But I don't think I have a plate, I'll have to look.  I was a lazy 
dumb a_at_# and didn't jack up the  bus when I tighened the bolts and didn't 
follow any order just snugged them up in rotation like lugs.  I'll back em 
off tonite put him in the air and torque em down in the order suggested.


Thanks,

Eric
