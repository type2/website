Hello....

I did not specify when I said that I used RTV on my case halves, how much I
used!  Just so I am not misunderstood or anything, I was aware that this
stuff could cause a great amount of damage if it got inside the engine/oil
paths, etc., so I used a very thin film of it.  That particular engine was
one of my favorites, so in the four years before I sold that bug(still
running strong, but with suspension problems I had not the technology or
budget to fix), I contend that I did no damage to the 1300 sp that pushed me
over many a steep, dusty hill......still regretting the sale of that
one.....

Gene
