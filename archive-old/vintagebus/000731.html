&lt;&lt;  Just out of curiosity, how do you beef up the amount of fiberglass in the 
bus
 tail dampeners?  Also, how do you affix the fiberglass to the tubing?  Heat 
tape, sew, zip-ties?&gt;&gt;
Hi George,
Take a look inside of the straight end of the muffler dampener.  The dampener 
is the J-shaped piece that goes between the muffler, and the tip of the 
exhaust system.  Looking inside of it you find an inner tube of steel pipe 
that is almost all holes than steel.  Very much the same construction as the 
1956 and later type 1 muffler tips.  The bus inner lining is held from 
falling/coming out of the dampener by a bent tab of the outer shell of the 
dampener.  Bend this tab back, and pull out the inner tubing.  We have found 
that to save costs the manufacture has been putting in a literal facial 
tissue amount of fiber glass cloth in there.  With the inner lining out we 
wrap the small amount of fiber glass the manufacture provided, and then wrap 
some more cloth that we have been getting from the fiber glass section of our 
local hardware store.  The main trick with installing the fiber glass is to 
only install enough to take up the area between the inner, and outer tubing 
loosely to allow this material to muffle the exhaust noise.

&lt;&lt; Does it make it quieter?&gt;&gt;
Yes, it does definitely help.  Having the engine balanced also helps very 
much to keep the noise down.  We have had volks complain that they can not 
hear our bus coming.  They actually have to stand behind the bus to hear it 
idleing.
  
&lt;&lt;Another thing, this fiberglass does it come in rolls or is it folded 
sheets? &gt;&gt;
The cloth material we have been buying comes in a sheet folded like a tarp 
into a plastic bag.  Eric&amp;Barb
