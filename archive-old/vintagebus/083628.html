Subject: Re: [WetWesties] What type of oil and fiter do you use?

Hi Phyllis,
We use Castrol 10-30 during the colder months of the year (Approx. from  
Labor Day to Memorial Day), and only use WIX filters.  We used to  use Fram filter 
and twice in cold (40s F) weather blew them.  The WIX  filters are a lot 
better built, and have an internal relief valve to  keep from over pressuring at 
start up.  We also tried 20-50 Wt. Castrol,  but in cold weather it acted more 
like straight 40 Wt.!!
