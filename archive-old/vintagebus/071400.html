Subject: camber setting on front end

So... had the front end rebuilt a couple summers ago.  The guy who rebuilt
it said to me, when I picked up the bus &quot;you should get an alignment, i
don't think I got the shims in properly on the left side&quot;.  well, not
surprisingly, the camber on the left wheel is WAY out, as evidenced by the
nice wear pattern on that tire, along with the alignment machine I put it
on at school (toe was ok.)

I have the Muir book but the section where it describes how to do this is a
bit vague, it kind of stops midway and starts suggesting taking the whole
axle out and getting VW to fix it....  I am wondering if I can get the
relevant bits apart without taking the brake plate off (i mean without
removing the 4 bolts around the spindle that Muir says to take out, just
kind of letting the whole brake assembly hang off the tie rod instead)  I'm
also not sure of the torque specs (if there are any) for the bolts holding
the king and link pin assembly in place.  Forgive me if I'm getting the
names wrong, I'm not too good with terminology.  No I do not have a bentley
manual.  If this is too difficult to explain in email, does anyone know if
a regular alignment shop would be able to do this?

thanks in advance,
diana
