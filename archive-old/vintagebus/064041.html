Subject: Speakers!

I was thinking about buiyng my son a good set of stereo speakers for his 66
splitty.
Anyone have any good experiences with any?? I just got a Cructfeild catalog
in yesterday, but have no clue has to what would fix where? He will buy a CD
system for his bus later. Since he has no system yet does that make getting
speakers a dumb Idea??
Thanks
Tom So.Ga.
