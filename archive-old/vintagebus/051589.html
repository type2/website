Subject: re:Oil Strainers-Magnetized

i am not sure about magnetized oil screens(not enough metal, and you dont=
 want
the screen to get clogged with any metal particles. Maybe you mean a magn=
et
that attaches to the filter. i had one in my old engine. there was an odd=
 type
of spring or clip type thing that attached it to the filter. not really s=
ure
if it helped much, it never seemed to have anythign on it, i washed it of=
f at
every oil change. One mechanic I spoke with told me they werent much use
because the engine block particles were not ferrous(ie they wont stick to=
 a
magnet) but there are other parts that will, but these are not likely to =
break
down into tiny particles.

hope that makes sense.
