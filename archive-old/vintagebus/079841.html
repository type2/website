Subject: knocking, and more friggen knocking!!

hey all,

   my motor is knocking and i dont know why. i looked
in the archives, and found someone else had my
problem, but it didnt answer it. i DONT have the idiot
guide or the haynes or anything like that. all i have
is the chiltons...and i hear they arent too good for
our engines. when i first start up, it knocks. when i
turn off the engine, it knocks. when i first
accellerate, it knocks. it will do this until im going
down the road and have shifted into second gear. once
im in second gear, she is all fine and dandy. but if
im in neutral, 1st gear, or reverse, it knocks like
crazy. im not even starting the motor up until i
figure out what to do. i am poor, cant get out of the
house for the idiot book (parents both work all day),
and im poor. any help would be appreciated.

p.s.
  samba folk said it might be a rod knocking. thanks
in advance,
josh
