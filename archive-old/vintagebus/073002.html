Subject: Re: [VB] How do you buy a new/old Beetle from Mexico?

&gt; Seems buying old VIN's and stamoping them into new
&gt; metal doesn't make it with our local cops.

The funny thing is that many of the classic airplanes flying around today
were &quot;restored&quot; from a bare data plate.  The only difference between this
and swapping VINs on cars is the wealth of the people doing it.

George
