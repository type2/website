Subject: Re: [VB] 30 PICT 1 - vs 28 PICT 1

For some quick info on what years (but not motors) these carbs were used
and how they differ, see http://www.type2_dot_com/library/fuel/kuhn1.htm and
http://www.type2_dot_com/library/fuel/kuhn2.htm.  As for that choke coil,
make sure you use the right voltage for your bus.  If its not marked on
the body you have to measure the resistance of the heating
element--around 5-6 ohms for 6v choke coil, 15-20 ohms for 12 volt.

There's also a helpful exploded diagram in PDF format at
http://www.kymcovw_dot_com/Media/pdfs/solex_info.pdf so you can make sure
all your carb parts are there.

&gt; So .... a few questions about the 30 PICT 1.  I have a 28 PICT 1 on my bus and
&gt; I get about 31 mpg (Imperial Gals.)  My motor is, I think it's called, a big
&gt; bore 40 hp.  I think it is 1400 cc.  So given that the 28 PICT was made for a
&gt; 1200 cc motor maybe I should have a slightly bigger carb on my 1400 cc motor.
&gt; A local guy had a 30 PICT 1 that I got and he assured me that it is a good
&gt; carb.
&gt; 
&gt; What's the story on those carbs.  What motor were they used for?
&gt; 
&gt; The coil dealy in the automatic choke is broken on my 28 PICT - could I just
&gt; pull that out and put the automatic choke coil dealy in the 28 from the 30?
&gt; 
&gt; My 28 PICT never did have power going to it and I see that the 30 PICT 1 has
&gt; two places for power - whoa - from where should the power come for the 30 PICT
&gt; - and why 2?
