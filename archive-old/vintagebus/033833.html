Enough wise guys!  :P

Actually, open door, put in block of ice, is the procedure, but a few things 
need to be in place first!  In my 1967 SO-42 here's how things went:
There should be a tray fitted in the ice box with a drain hole.  This is 
where you put the ice.  The drain hole should have a metal fitting on it to 
which a drain hose can be attached.  The bottom of the icebox should have a 
corresponding hole for the hose to go through.  The bottom of your bus should 
have a hole so that as the ice melts, it is collected by the tray; drains out 
through the hose and finally to the outside of the bus.  The hole in the 
bottom of the bus had a square of rubber or plastic (can't remember) with a 
slit for the hose to stick out.  That way outside water couldn't get in.
When the ice box drains and leaves a puddle helpful passer-bys will let you 
know that your radiator is leaking.
