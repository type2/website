 &gt;&gt;We use roofing tar the non-fibered type. Go out a buy a condiment container

I know that this is a pretty dumb question, but I'm not sure what kind of tar
you're specifying - is this stuff ever available in a caulking gun container? 
I've looked and can't find anything but that stuff - and it is the fiberous
tar.  I asked in the local home depot but they didn't know of other types. 
But then again, sometimes those guys don't know every category in that big ol'
store.  Should the stuff be located near the &quot;regular&quot; roofing tar and I'm
just missing it?
