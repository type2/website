I know it was covered in the archive but I can't figure out how to read the
replies to the posts in the archive so I will post it here. I am having some
problems, when I put in my clutch the car dies. It will idle OK if I leave
the clutch out but won't move if I don't engage the clutch. Need to get back
on the road.

Thanks in advance.
Dave
