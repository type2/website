GL-5 has additives which will corrode the bronze parts in your tranny.
Hi Tom,
Close!  GL-5 will not effect expensive bronze syncros, but will corrode 
cheaper brass ones.  VW used the cheaper ones, (we know because we have the 1970s 
VW shop bulletin on this subject) so you know that your tranny has for an 
absolute certainty the bronze ones......  Otherwise you will end up with at least a 
crashbox tranny!!
