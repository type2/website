&lt;&lt; I'm wondering...what do y'all think this New Microbus, if it comes out,
 will do to the market for air-cooled Buses?  I wasn't paying very
 close attention but it seems that interest in and prices of real
 Beetles went up when the New Beetle came out.  &gt;&gt;

What do you think it will do. All the burnt out burn outs will wanna have one 
then, even more than now. The end is near my friends.
