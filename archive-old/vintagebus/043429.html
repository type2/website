&gt;Ok, my lights that are not working are the lil' bulbs in the headlight
&gt;buckets (those i referred to as running lights)  and my license plate light,
&gt;and my brake lights.  

As was pointed out to me recently, the little bulbs in the headlight
buckets are only supposed to be on when the headlight switch is pulled
out to the first click.  When the headlights are on (second click)
these lights are off.

If yours never come on, check terminal 57 at the headlight switch.
It should have two wires on it and have power whenever the switch
is pulled out the first click.  If no power, the trouble is probably
inside your headlight switch.  If it has power, the trouble is in
the wiring, bulbs, or grounding.  

The license plate light is wired off the right rear tail light, so
if it's working, the license plate light is probably getting power.
Make sure the right rear tail light socket has one wire coming off
one terminal and two wires coming off the other...the one with
two wires is the tail light power wire from the headlight switch
and the other one goes up to the license plate light.  If this
is OK, check for a dead bulb or bad ground to the license plate
light.
 
Clara posted a good check for your brake lights (testing it at
the master cylinder switch).  

Don't forget http://www.vintagebus_dot_com/wiring/index.html .
 
I hope this helps!
