&lt;&lt; to be truthful, the gauge does look original, so does the hole the its

Hi Glynn,
Well if it was a dealer installation it would have a sharp edge to the hole
and not have the factory paint on the edge.  If you dash still has the
factory paint!  The later stock fuel gauge holes are smooth as silk on the
edges and painted at the factoy.

the pre 62 gas gages read FULL to EMPTY, or theequivaleny in German.
different stuuf written on it I am saying.

Also a few years ago I pulled a gas guage and sender dated 2/57 out of a 58
standard in a junkyard that had been there for decades.   (still had an
emblem on it  :))  anyway,  the guage was not an original installation from
the dash hole not factory painted, but I'd bet a donut it was a dealer
install later.
