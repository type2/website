Subject: Interior Color on 65 Deluxe
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

My 65 deluxe is headed to the paint booth soon to get
a fresh coat of Sea blue and Blue White.  I am also
getting the interior painted.

My question is, what color is the dash, partition,
floor etc.?  My fresh air vent is in excellent
original shape and it Blue white.  However, if i read
the Wolfsburg West color chart correctly most of the
interior should be silver beige.  Would it be correct
to have the fresh air vent and front door window
frames Blue white and the rest of the interior (cab
area) Silver beige?

Also considering just going Cloud white on all
interior and exterior (above the waistline). Any
thoughts on that?

Thanks
