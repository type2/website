Subject: 1776

I've been wanting to build a 1776 for my bus for a long time. Steve (the
parts wiz where I work) and I were discussing it this morning before
Chris came in to visit. Chris is a longtime VW enthusiast who is into
stock bug restoration.

Chris bought a very nice 66 bug that came with a 1776. He pulled that
engine to put the proper stock engine back in (1500?), and asked if we
knew anyone who might be interested in buying the 1776. He told us that
the PO built the engine about 10k miles ago, it has a counterweighted
crankshaft, he has all the receipts, and it ran just fine before he
pulled it and stored it in his garage...

&quot;I might be interested,&quot; I told him. &quot;What do you want for it?&quot;

&quot;I'll sell it cheap to you. How about $200?&quot;

I nearly $#!+ my pants! &quot;Yeah! I'll take it!&quot;

So, tomorrow I'm going to Chris's house to pick it up, and I'll have a
$200 engine to bolt up to my $50 tranny...

Life is good.

Next weekend I'll take my old engine to Athens GA to put into my
daughter's super beetle. Two birds with one stone!
