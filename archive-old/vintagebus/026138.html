Look people, I NEVER said Todd's nice Westy and beautiful original safari
windows weren't &quot;worth it&quot;.  I was just commenting on the going rate of
stuff VW.  This is after all, a forum for public posting of things VW bus
like...&quot;gee whiz prices are high&quot; and all!  If you don't want people to
comment on a post, don't post it here.

I apologize Todd, if anyone here was dissuaded from buying your bus with or
with out the beautiful original safari windows by anything I said.  I
encourage anyone who was, to mail me personally and I'll talk you into
buying Todd's really nice Westfalia with the beautiful original safari
windows!  Really!

Mine are not for sale.  That's why you didn't see a FS post from me :-)

&gt; who really cares?  But see, I am trying to sell the
&gt; bus...and a &quot;GEEE those safaris costs alot! duhhh..&quot;
&gt; comment does not do great for my efforts sellin it,
&gt; regardless if the wise crack comment is true or
