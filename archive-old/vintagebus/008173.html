&gt; On your bus 912E engine conversion did you change out the FI camshaft when
&gt; installing the Webers?  This may explain HP loss in your bus.  The cams
are
&gt; specific for carbs or FI.  The FI cams probably do not have the proper
ramp
&gt; on them to create a vacuum for the carbs to give the heads a good gas
&gt; mixture.

I am a little puzzled trying to find the source for this suggestion.

1) 1700, 1800, and 2.0L with solid lifters all used the same camshaft 021
109 021L. [except auto trans buses, they have 2 narrow bands cast in the
shaft, see Bentley sec 5 page 59]

2) 2.0L 78-79 used hydralic lifters, camshaft 022 109 021A

3) all USA 2.0L buses from 76 to 79 were fuel injected.

Can you supply a part # for a carbed 2.0L?
