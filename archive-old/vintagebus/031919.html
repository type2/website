&lt;&lt; The sound does not get louder necessarily. It is more distinct b/c the 
engine is not reving but not really louder. What do you think it is? And out 
of curriousity why would this happen suddendly? This is a relativly low 
mileage bus and I'm just wondering. &gt;&gt;
Hi Ben,
There are so many reasons for such a noise.  Almost all involving the 
connecting rods, pistons, cylinders, or even heads.  The only thing we can 
think of that would not involve complete engine disassembly/rebuild would be 
if you have a broken pushrod or pulled rocker stud.  So check those out first!
  You mention &quot;low mileage bus&quot;, does this mean it is all original or that 
you do not know when or who last rebuilt the engine?  Either way anything 
could have been done to it or any of the parts.  Including long term storing 
it with used oil for over six months.  Used oil breaks down once it has been 
exposed to gasolene in a running engine, even if only run five minutes.  We 
have two 25HP engine cases that would be rebuildable except the sump area of 
these cases is rotted out due to acidic oil!   Eric&amp;Barb
