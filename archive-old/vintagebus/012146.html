Hey Josh, 

I was just checking out your info on Sundials and Rivieras and thought you
may
be interested in a Sundial for sale.  It's a 1964 deluxe bus with all the
chrome and everything rather than a panel.  It even has the big chrome
emblem
on the front.  The interior is a non walkthrough with the sink directly
behind
the passenger seat and a water tank that can be removed when you open the
door.  It's the only Sundial I have ever seen in person but it does have
the
Sundial badge attached to the sink.  The rest of the interior matches the
sink
so I assume it is all original Sundial.  Overall the bus is in fair
condition.
It has some light repairable damage to the front and some more serious but
still repairable damage to the rear passenger side.  The front doors have
some
rust through but the rockers and the rest of the bus appear relatively free
of
rust or at least rust through.  The motor is there and the owner says it
will
turn over but he could not get it started.  I'm not sure where you are
located, but the camper is in Clinton, Arkansas.  Clintion is in north
central
Arkansas about two hours of north of Little Rock.  The owner was asking
$500
for the bus. If you are interested you can e-mail me at
GoKayaking_at_mailexcite_dot_com or call me at 417-888-4192.  Don't e-mail my AOL
address because I never check it.

See ya on the road,
Randall Gammill
