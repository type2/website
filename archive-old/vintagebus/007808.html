Today I took a little delivery over to one of the local factories.  It was
nothing more than 12 2x4's 10' STD ripped in half to make 2x2's.  Ever try
to rip a 2x4 exactly down the middle, only to find out that you didn't get
it _just_ right?  A little trick I've learned that makes a customer thing
you are really the man who knows the machine is to set the saw to
purposefully cut one side just a little bit narrower than the other.  You
then take the larger piece, roll it over 180 degrees and pass it thru the
saw and there you go - 2 identical pieces with only one sawn edge on either
piece.  They all think I'm so good, I have people request that only I cut
their lumber because I get it right the first time.  Go figure. :-)

Anyway, I hauled my piddly deliver about 6 blocks to the factory and there,
outside by the receiving dock, was Rick - one of the town's 2 forklift
experts/maintenace men who work for Nebraska CAT out of Lincoln, NE.  Rick
is the one who gave me some brand new discarded inventory a year ago which
consisted of a dual fuel carb (propane and gasoline), a mixer, and a
regulator with a few other goodies.
IMCPO seems to be the prominent names on these parts.  Anyway, I hadn't seen
Rick for quite some time so we chatted for a bit and he asked me if I
converted any of my VWs to propane yet.  I told him no, that I needed to
build a bigger displacement engine before I could afford to take a little
power loss.  He said, &quot;Well I got something else for ya.&quot;  He pulled out a
good used propane carb. which had sat on a forklift last winter.  When they
went to start the lift, it wouldn't run very well and the innards of this
carb got a little sticky from sitting.  &quot;All it needs is a rebuild,&quot; said
Rick.  I asked him what he was going to do with it and he said, &quot;Throw it
away.&quot;  So I said, &quot;It's mine now.&quot;  He just smiled and we chatted some more
about the this little gizmo.

I studied it over at work and a workmate of mine (the backwoodsy farmer guy
who burns wood for heat, charges batteries for electricity to power the
shop, and owns a Buckeye Powered Parachute) who runs propane in his pickup
helped me figure out how it works.   Once we figured it out, he was jealous
because this little doodad replaces the mixer he has to run on his pickup.

How it works is that it goes inline in the air path before the stock
gasoline carb.  The aircleaner fits off to one side and then the carb goes
below so it's a 90 degree bend.  When the toggle is flipped, there is what
looks like a miniature stove burner (which is a round thing with holes that
helps to mix propane with air) that is controlled by the vaccuum from the
engine.  The butterfly in the gasoline carb is still used to regulate the
flow and thusly the throttle.  It kind of runs on a spring/bellows
arrangement.  This gizmo also has a mixture and idle adjustment.  All that
would be required in addition to this propane carb is a regulator to drop
the pressure down to reasonable levels.

So I know Bob Hoover did a study on propane and decided it wasn't feasible
but I must admit with rising gas prices and my workmate friend John's nice
clean oil dipstick after 3 years and 90,000 miles on his Ford V8, I've
thought about it.  With my T4 project that I want to start after my ebay
marathon is overwith,  I just might put this little doodad to use.  It's
easy to add-on and try - easy to remove when you get pissed off because it
doesn't work.  I'm aware of the power loss incurred by burning propane but
after building this 1776 engine, I have a totally newfound respect for a
stock and reliable design.  I've also thought a good place to mount a
propane tank is in the back luggage area in my bus or even on the roofrack.
Putting fins on it to make it look like a missle or simply make it look like
some kind of rocket launcher would be awesome.  And since my friend gets
propane on contract, I would get it cheaper through him for my local travels
vs. metering it out a few pounds at a time.

Just food for thought.
