Subject: Blowing Steam and Thom's offer
Date: Tue, 6 Jun 2000 19:06:01 -0700
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

 Just got off an email to all NEATO BOD's and stated my views. Had to write
the list to calm myself down and explain to some of the new listies my offer
to Thom . The deal was I challenged Thom to drive one of his buses down to
the Classic and I would pay his gas one way. I knew all along  it was a no
brainer for me as Thom never drives his buses over 100 miles either way. But
I had to put the carrot out there. I couldn't make the offer to any other
listies as I knew they all drive their buses everywhere and I would lose the
gas money.

SEE YOU ALL THIS WEEKEND

John Howard
