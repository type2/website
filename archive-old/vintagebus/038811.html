The Brauerei that we toured in Hannover was called Herrenhauser (and of
course we saw the VW Nutzfahrzeuge Fabrik where all post 56 Transpoters were
built).  Paulaner is definitely from Bavaria but I dont think that
Warsteiner is.  Warsteiner, Becks and St. Pauli Girl are rather lackluster
beers by German standards but are still better than American mass-produced
swill like Miller, Bud or Old Piles.  As far as Milwaukee's
Best...arrggghhh....better lets not speak of it.  I would rather drink my
own urine.  I am not sure if WOB has a local brew.

&gt;
&gt;yes- the Milwalkee's Best now inspires you to cut the bus and put type 3
&gt;lids over the motor.

Whereas drinking Warsteiner or Paulaner makes you go on a hunt for
those *correct* one-hour-of-production-only license plate screws... :)

Actually those two beers are probably more southern Germany.  Don't
know what the popular brew is in Wolfsburg or Hanover...
