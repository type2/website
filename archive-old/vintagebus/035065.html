Hi Auker,
The only really good way to do this is to put yourself into the spot you 
normally use for adjusting the clutch.  In front of the left rear wheel.  
Then reach with a 17mm closed ended wrench over the top of the tranny to the 
starter and place it on the bolt head.  Remove the nut in the engine 
compartment and either get one of those half moon headed bolts to fit the 
later starter (If you are using one of those.) or if you are using an early 
starter have a chunk of steel welded to the side of the bolt head to make it 
lock against the starter.  Eric&amp;Barb
