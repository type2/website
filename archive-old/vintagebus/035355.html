&lt;&lt; When was the switch from having the front door window latches attached to a
 metal piece on the bottom of the window to being attached directly to the
 glass?  
 
 I couldn't find the info. on type2_dot_com

the tempered 'sekurit' glass had latches through the glass.  The laminated 
'sigla' glass had the latch attached the the rail under the glass.  So what 
you are asking was when was which style of glass used

  Sekurit was used through about mid 56 I believe, the large logo (couple 
varietys) SEKURIT. 

 Then for a while (through 60?) sekurit (small logo) was used on commercials, 
while sigla was used on passenger cars, including westys. 

 61-63 everything got sigla. 

 64- 67 everthing got sekurit.   I know its a little fuzzy here, but that's 
about what i have gathered.
