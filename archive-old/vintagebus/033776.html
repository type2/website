&lt;&lt; Hi all this is my first posting so here goes.I'v just picked up a 59 Pannel
with semaphores(but the semaphores are missing, although I know who has
them)now this is my question. Is there a differance between bus and beetle
semaphores? and do bus semaphores have a 2...... part number?  &gt;&gt;
Hi Steve, 
The same semaphores were used on both the bus and bug, except early cabroilet
bug.  There are differnt manufactures of these and different years that they
were installed in the VWs.   Eric &amp; Barb
