Subject: Re: [VB] Confusing timing feedback...

&gt;Anyway I was checking the timing and when I put the light on the #1 
&gt;wire it skips around from TDC to all kinds of various places.

I have sometimes had problems like this with my timing light when
the timing light pickup is too close to another plug wire.  Say
I clamp it on the #1 wire but the clamp is also lying on #2 wire --
sometimes I'll get some erratic flashes.  Moving the clamp to to
somewhere on the #1 wire where that wire is all by itself usually
helps.  My timing light has a &quot;shielded&quot; metal pickup clamp and
this still happens.  You might try clamping on right next to the
plug, where the plug wires are fairly far apart. 

I did see your post where you got it sorted but I figured the info
might be helpful in the future.

Good luck!
