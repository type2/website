Subject: Re: [VB] SCORE!!! A dream comes true...

................ 
&gt; It's a long story, but the short version is that I found (or it found me!) a
&gt; brand new, never been fitted, original poptop tent for my 63 Dormobile! That's
&gt; right, a NOS red-and-white candy-striped vinyl tent for a split bus Dormobile
&gt; roof! How many of those can there be in the world?
..........................
&gt; And I still can't believe that my little fantasy about the old lady and her
&gt; Dormobile tent actually came true in every detail!
&gt; 
&gt; Don't be afraid to dream!
.................

Great story! Are you sure you want to settle for the red stripes instead of
the green or blue stripes?    Grin,

Tom Buese-good karma always come back to you
