Subject: Re: [VB] Faulty CB Brazilian Heads ?

  Don't blame it on CB, they are the same heads as everyone else sold back then and up to a year ago when they 
became NLA. I personally never use the valves, springs, etc in any aftermarker head I use. All of these get changed or I 
buy bare heads and build them myself. Just be happy that you even had a set of new single port to begin with. I only 
know of one source that even has any for sale and they are 250 dollars each and the new Brazilian aftermarket ones 
that just became available are 200 dollars each!!!

&gt; I bought a set of Brazilian SP heads  in about 1982 from CB at a very low
&gt;sale price. I recently used them when rebuilding my 70 bus engine.
&gt;
&gt;I just did the first valve adjust since the rebuild and found all the
&gt;clearances had dropped from .006 to about .002.
&gt;
&gt;I discussed the disappearing valve clearance with a local ACVW expert. He
&gt;told me that CB Brazilian heads of that era commonly failed when the keeper
&gt;end of the valve pulled apart and dropped the valve into the compression
&gt;chamber with the expected result. Replacement of the Brazilian valves with
&gt;higher quality valves before failure is the only solution
&gt;
&gt;Anyone on the list familiar with this type of head/valve failure with
&gt;CB/Brazilian heads? Also, any recommendation for a good quality valve? My
&gt;engine is completely stock except for balancing.
