Hi all, just thought I'd drop a quick line and introduce myself.  I've been
a friend of Thom Fitzpatrick's for about 3 years now and his bus insanity
has finally absorbed me, too.  I just bought my first Type 2, a '64 single
cab.  There's nothing particularly unique about this truck, apart form the
dual cargo doors.  But hey, it's a great first bus, I think.  I've owned
about every variation of Type 1 over the last 16 years, so I'm intimately
familiar with them.  And being around Thom, I've also been bombarded with
useless VW bus information, and I've spent some quality time working on his
'55 Westy.

I was also involved with Steve Gutknect's '67 Westy rescue, and driving
that thing after we installed the engine was probably what really inspired
me to sell my extra Ghia and buy a bus (I hope you're happy with yourself,
Steve).  

Anyway, I just wanted to say hi, and I'll just be lurking for the time
being, I'll save my dumb questions for Thom!  


Thanks for the bandwidth,
