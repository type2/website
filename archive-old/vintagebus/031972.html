&lt;&lt; Can you recommend some brands of dielectric grease to look for, that are 
suitable for VWs? &gt;&gt;
Hi Jim,
Any type of dielectric grease should work just fine!  We happened to find and 
use &quot;GC Type Z5 Silicone compound&quot;  &quot;An excellent lubricant and dielectric 
compound&quot;  &quot;Contents: 1 FL. OZ.&quot; and comes in a tube.  This and all of the 
chemicals below except for the phosperic acid we were able to get at a real 
electronics shop.  Radio Shack was of little or no help.
  First though we use M.G. Chemicals Safety Wash Cleaner Degreaser to remove 
any and all dirt, grease, oil and paper towel off the remains of this 
chemical to remove as much of the traces of the materials being removed.  
This is listed as safe on most plastics and for us was no problem on the 1963 
SC signal switch we tried it on.
  Following this we have used phosperic acid (You can use Naval Jelly for 
steel from your local hardware store.) to clean really badly corroded 
switching points.  This acid must be applied carefully with a Q-tip or such 
like to just the brass contact areas as needed.  Sprayed/splashed on 
indiscrimintly  this acid will eat up the zinc plating and any zinc pot metal 
casting of switches.  After applying about 10-15 minutes or more, but before 
the acid dries rinse well with water.   If you do not rinse the acid the 
microscopic brass dust the acid creates will cause a worse corrosion flim 
over the contact points!
  If the contact points look pretty clean or after acid cleaning them we use 
M.G. Chemicals Contact Cleaner With Silicons &quot;Fast Dry-Nonconductive-Safe On 
Plastics&quot; which comes in a 5 OZ. spray can.  Both cans come with a adjustable 
twist noozle to increase or decrease the chemical spray pressure!  We put 
our's on lowest power.  This chemical works especially well if you move the 
switch back and forth before this chemical dries.  This helps the chemical by 
mechanically cleaning off the last of any corrosion and spread a light 
coating of silicon sealant in the contact cleaner over the contact points.  
Apply the dielectric grease added to the points for a thicker longer lasting 
coat after the contact cleaner dries.
  Result with doing all this and cleaning, soldering the clips together, 
dielectric greasing the contact points in the fuse box resulted in much 
brighter faster tail ligh signals!  Plus the head lights got a bit more 
brighter.
