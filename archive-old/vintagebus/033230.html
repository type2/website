Subject: Frozen front shock bushing - Help!
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

Hit a wall today, when I went to put on my new gas adjust shocks up front on 
the 67 Westy and what!? the bottom of the shock wont fit over the lower bolt. 
Closer look and the old shocks steel bushing is still on the lower bolt. I 
tried some heat, liquid wrench and pull, pry, slight taps with the hammer and 
nothing. The front lower old shock bushing is frozen on and wont come off. 

Need to ask the list: How do I get this old bushing off. The rubber is long 
rotted off but that steel bushing is stuborn as hell to get off of there. A 
friend suggested a hammer and chisel. Is this an area that can take a lot of 
pounding? hate to bend that stud or worse yet break it off. Please advise.

Thank you.
