Hi All.

I was trying to put together my safaris last night and realized that the
windows I have are complete SH^T (that's all caps for a reason!).  The
corners are all wrong and they are actually too narrow...  I'd tell you who
made them but let's not all go there.

Anyway, who makes good safari glass for original frames that IS the right
size and shape?  Or, who has that original pair in their garage that they're
willing to part with for a few thousand dollars. ;-)

Also, I noticed that the rubber seals (WCM) stretch quite a bit and I always
ended up with extra that could not be crammed into the rail... even though I
soaped everything up real good.  How do you do it right?  But then again,
maybe this happened since my glass is the wrong size.
