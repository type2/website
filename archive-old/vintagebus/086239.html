Subject: Re: What is a rust-free '65 worth?

IF the bus is completely rust free...

If you are the type of person who would drive a rat bus and not care  
about improving its appearance. Then a rust-free bus isn't worth all  
that much more than a rusty bus. Unless we're talking left-in-a-field- 
for-20-years rusty.

If you are the type of person who wants to take a bus to a show and  
have people drool over it, then the rust-free bus is worth several  
thousands or more than a rusty bus.

It's fairly easy finding someone who will swap in a motor for you. It  
is next to impossible finding a reputable welder that knows how to  
weld on flat, thin metal - that will touch your bus for the price you  
can pay. Start out with what you want.

In my opinion, unless the bus is mechanically awesome, $6500 is too  
much to pay for a standard needing a good paint job (unless it is in  
its original painted condition) with average mechanicals. (Daily  
driver says average mechanicals to me, with future work needing to be  
performed.) Factor in the proper set of tires while you're looking.
