Yah too bad hes lying. Everett prolly has parts he wants so hes tryin to
sucker up. He didnt even get the year of my bus right.
My paint was badly oxidized,  and the gates had mass surface rust. The
inside had nice og paint so i didnt touch it. If you look closely at the
gates , you can see the &quot;logos&quot; on them.  I live in a neighborhood
association, so i dont get the privelege of leaving an &quot;eyesore&quot; just laying
around like greg does.
Heres a picture of my bus when i bought it. I think youll understand why i
had to primer when you see it.

goin in for paint soon.

Mike&gt;I agree with greg, thats a sin.

Greg  &gt;BTW, Wade primered over his dove blue logo sporting original paint 56
 singlecab because &quot;It had a few scratches&quot;.!!!
