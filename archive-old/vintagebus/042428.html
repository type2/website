hi all,

I have more info on 63 transaxles if you are interested...

the 63 1 ton option is configured as follows:
reduction gears are a 1.26 ratio, the same as 64+ rgb ratio.
the bearings are the same as all small nut rgb bearings
the lower stub axle is longer
the brakes are basically the same size as 64+

the 63 3/4 ton is exactly the same as 60-62, with the exception of the
mounts in the nosecone being 10mm studs instead of 8mm. (i believe, to
make sure im going to check out my friends 63 3/4 ton pickup)

hope that sheds some light...

peas,

Steve

P.S. i currently have in my posession one of these beasts, but it is going
to a friend to fix his 63 single cab :)
