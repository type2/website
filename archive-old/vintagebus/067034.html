Subject: Re: [VB] Front Shift Rod Coupling: Why cut/weld rather than
  tap?

believe me, it is easier to cut the coupler than drill out the bolt.   The 
couple is fairly soft, for one thing.

The earlier buses have two set screws in the forward coupler- the forward 
coupler is a tube and the rods butt up in it.   
The later splits one rod end is a tube that slide over the other rod, then 
the coupler is  outside of that- line up the holes and one screw ties them 
all together.

I had got a repro front coupler for my 61 (2 screw) from WW.   It worked, but 
the ID was larger than it ought to be.   For a piece of pipe with a couple 
holes tapped in it for $8 I expected a nice fit.  Oh well, it did work.   Are 
the single hole couplers available?

PS grease parts before assembling, in case you ever need to take it apart.
