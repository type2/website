Hi Josh,
Those are regulator and oil pressure idiot lights.  If the oil pressure light 
comes on you need to turn off the engine instantly, or better yet five 
seconds before it came on.  When the regulator light comes on you need to shut off 
the engine within ten or twenty seconds.  Either way not turning the engine off 
in time can result in the sudden need of an engine rebuild!
  Check the Idiot's manual and the VW bus shop manual for more info.  
Hopefully you just need to work over your electrical system, but make sure your oil 
level is above the fill line and the fan belt is not too tight or loose.
