I've found them at an RV store. They came on a big roll that they sold by
the foot. They were plastic and I had to cut them down to fit in the channel
correctly but work great.

&gt; I havent seen a source for these alone, but you can buy generic curtain
&gt; slider setups with similar pieces and swap over the plastic bits. I found
&gt; some for my old 67 westy in jc whitney
