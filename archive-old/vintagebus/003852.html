  Hi Dan,  I tack welded a bolt that was long enough to go 
through an oil pump puller, tighten down on the nut and the 
metal covers ease right out.  I had soaked them first with PB
Blaster (penetrating oil).  Use a cut off wheel and grind smooth.
  I bought all my RB bearings from Ronnie at Old Volks here in Havasu AZ.  He also has the hidden axle nuts and the metal covers if you want new ones.
  Lou in Havasu,
