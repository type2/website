You can  put a lug on _both_ ends of the battery cable. 


Hi Volks,
We would suggest against that.  Adding additional connections just  makes for 
more problems, AND in that area with the battery acid causing so much  more 
corrosion.....
  Kevin have you checked with a voltage meter for where the voltage  drop is? 
 Have you soldered both the fuse box and headlight  switch?  If so, and there 
is no detectable voltage drop, check out in the  1963-67 Workshop Manual 
Volkswagen Transporter, section E-2, page 14.
