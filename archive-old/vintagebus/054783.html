Subject: Re: Free Beam Come and get it!

    If anyone is interested I have a front disk brake front end. I got it
for some trade work but I am moving and don't want to store it in my new
house. I live on the Central Coast (California) and will be moving this
week. I will be able to retrieve it from the location that I am at for about
two weeks so please let me know. Sorry I wont ship it you pick it up!

PS: Everything is on the beam except the master cylinder. This came with a
23 window that a previous owner was going to install.

&gt; If you do the 68 rear set up, you need an IRS conversion, which is
basically
&gt; even more difficult and complicated than the rig you have now. Bus Boys
&gt; sells these kits, and are adjustable for ride height from stockish to 4.5
&gt; inches drop.
&gt; I would go with the redux boxes, which is what I did to go back to stock
&gt; form the same rig you have now. Get uncut spring plates, a trans (Ronnie
can
&gt; hook you up really nicely with a Rancho outright) and bolt her right in.

&gt;
&gt;
&gt; I've posted a few previous queations regarding this and have appreciated
&gt; everyone's help.  Upon the advice of many I have located a '68 front end
in
&gt; real good shape, everything there except the brakes, so I'm going to go
that
&gt; route and eliminate the king and link pins.  The rear is complicated and I
&gt; have had it checked out at a local reputable shop.  The tranny is a swing
&gt; axle Type I, the spring plates have been modified as well.  To get back to
&gt; regulation height I have been advised to go back to the reduction gear
boxes
&gt; and a freeway flyer tranny, to give me some decent speed.
&gt;
&gt; Here's my question:  Since I'm going full 1968 up front, could I install a
&gt; regular '68 rear suspension and transmission that would get me back to
&gt; normal height and thus avoid the reduction gear boxes?  Would that work on
a
&gt; 1961 panelvan?  Thanks again for all your help.  Don.
