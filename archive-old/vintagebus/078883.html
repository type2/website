Subject: $199 Tent Deal  - Instruction Sheets

The $199 tents from the list member deal shipped as promised, and in
fact some of you may have received yours as early as today.  However,
since we were kicking them right out the door as we unloaded the
container, we didn't have time to print and insert the assembly
instructions.

For those who have one coming, I have posted the instructions at a
temporary URL.  I will keep this page up for a few weeks, so please
print a copy (or save the image on your hard drive). If you have trouble
viewing/downloading it, please let me know.

Zipped version for download (slightly higher resolution):

For anyone who buys a tent from now on, the instructions will already be
packed in the box. 

Thanks,
