Subject: Steering gear and shimmy

Hi Volks,

I am considering a bus for sale, I think a '66, where the owner describes a
serious shimmy.  Here are his exact words:

  &quot;The main problem is that at about 30mph it shimmys a lot. I've checked
tie rods etc., and adjusted the steering gear. No go. I think the steering
gear might be bad.&quot;

Any ideas on the cause to this?  Anything to check that might better reveal
the cause?

Assuming we have a correct diagnostic:   Availability of appropriate
replacement parts?  Special tools and / or skill to do such a repair?

Thanks.
