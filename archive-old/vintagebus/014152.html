OK , has anybody found or made brackets to mount fog lights on the bumper 
brackets between the body and the bumper blade? There is only a few inches 
there so I guess the bracket would need to be turned to fit.. Any plans or 
sources?Keeping in mind this is for the early &quot;ribbed&quot; bumper so I can't see 
bolting them to the bumper or body. Thanks
