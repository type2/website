Subject: paint has begun! -  and a warning!

Hello Everyone,

Left work early yesterday to go to the high school body shop to prep the bus 
for paint.  Got there about 2:30, left last night around 9:30.  Did the 
math, I spent more time working on the bus yesterday than I spent at work.  
By any scale of measurement, that's a good day.

I shot the interior of the bus, door jambs, lots of little parts, and 
insides of all the doors and hatches (they were off the bus) with PPG 
Concept L289.  The color looks great.  It is probably a bit more green than 
the factory L289 (I think it was Clara that pointed that out awhile ago), 
but I really like it.  I'm a bit partial though...

Left the bus in the paint booth overnight, then went to pick it up when they 
unlocked the school at 7:30 this am.  A bit of background, the bus is a 
rolling shell, I tow it to the school (about 2.5 miles away) with a tow bar 
I have borrowed in perpetuity from the local VW shop, and a Nissan Xterra I 
borrow from my brother every thursday.  Anyway, got the bus behind the truck 
and get about a quarter mile from home when I hear a banging noise coming 
from the bus.  Stop the truck, and go back for a look-see.  The driver side 
front wheel is being held on with only 2 lug bolts, and those two are 
working loose! Aaaah!  The wheel was beginning to flop around, hence the 
noise.  Got the jack and lug wrench out of the nissan, and jack the bus in 
the left lane with the flashers on.  It's about 8:30, and the freeway 
on-ramp is about 500 yds ahead so traffic is beginning to build.  Next 
dilemma, Nissan lugs are 19mm, bus ones are 17.  The wrench kinda works, but 
not really.  Threads on one of the two lugs are trashed, so I go around to 
the other three wheels thinking I'll pull one off of each to make enough.  
Only able to get one off with the 19mm wrench (but I guess that's a good 
thing, right) so I snug up the two lugs I have as best I can with the stupid 
wrench, and nurse the bus home.  I have some extra lug bolts leftover from 
when I replaced my front beam last year, so as soon as I get in front of the 
house, I get everything back the way it should be.  The lug bolt holes in my 
rim look like they got abused a bit, I'll get a closer look at them tonight 
after work, but after a cursory glance, everything looks okay. I've seen 
postings on the list to check your lugs periodically, and I would highly 
recommend it.  I convinced myself that since I was towing it, and only once 
a week for a couple of miles, I shouldn't have to worry.  I'm embarrassed to 
say that I don't know if I lost the three lugs today, or if they have been 
working themselves loose over the past months.  I didn't even bother to 
check.  Never Again!!!

Anyway, I will try to get some pictures of my new pretty interior and get 
them accessible to the list.  I will be in the booth again in a couple of 
weeks to shoot the bottom color (L390), and then more L289 for the roof and 
above the belt.  To all those on their way to BYOB, travel safe, and snug 
the lugs before you hit the road!
