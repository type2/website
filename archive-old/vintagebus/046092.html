Hi Wilder,
Actually it is best to find out the proper static timing point for your 
distributor.  With points properly adjusted set the distributor staticly and 
then test with an adjustable timing light and tach to make sure it hits at 
least 20 degrees BTDC _at_ 2,500 RPM, which is the minimum VW states.  Write 
down where the distributor maxes out at 2,500 and 3,000 RPM.  Repeat this 
test every couple of years to keep an eye on the condition of your 
distributor or anytime you have a question about it's condition.
