Well,

not wishing to be the harbinger of doom
or anything, but it sounds like the 
torsion arms are well and truly
rusted on....

This can be an utter buzzard and more
difficult to solve than the famous
rusted on front shift coupler...or the rusty cable stuck
in the cable tube problem.......

I'd try a gentle tap first just to see if it looks like
the arms will come off.  Probably not.

Then I'd drill a some holes in the top of the
front beam tubes and fill both with 
penetrene or whatever....I'd do it a few times

I'd then try and move the ends.  A little heat
on the torsion arm ends where they are held
onto the torsion arm leaves may help at this 
point........

Then I'd try and dismantle the beam/leaves.
