hey all, 
i just got a 64 EZ camper and i need to take the heads out so i can put them 
on my 1600. can i take them off while the engine is still in the bus? i cant 
get the engine to come out, cuz no size wrench firts the nuts. i cant use a 
ratchet because there is no room. i really need to get these heads off because i 
am planning on goin to bug a paluza with my grandpa, so i need the bus to run. 
thanks in advance.
yes you have to pull the engine to pull the heads

You need a 17mm  wrench to undo the bolts holding the motor in.

Good engine pull description in John Muir's &quot;How to Keep Your VW Alive, A 
Guide for the Compleat Idiot&quot;, available in many places.. inprint for 35 years 
and widely available cheap at used bookshops... every veedub owner should have 
one. 

Why swap heads?  If the engine runs good, why not just swap engines?
