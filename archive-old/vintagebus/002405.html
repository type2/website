hey guys,
  I have seen so many single cab conversions it makes me sick. however, I
have not seen one even close to this and I  wondered if anyone had any info.
I saw it on a old black and white movie and the ppl were talking Japanese
and it had American sub titles. Basically what is was, was a single cab that
had the passenger side chopped off vertically right before emblem and
horizontally a little above the floor line. it had the bed extended out all
the way through where the passenger seat used to be up to flush with the
nose, so you could carry extra long pipes etc on that side. anyone know if
this was a vw conversion or just a beater used at some factory?
