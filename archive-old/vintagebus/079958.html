Subject: Jerome trip report (long)

Well.where do we begin.

Had the bus loaded and ready to roll at 12am on Wednesday night.  We woke up
some groggy kids and hit the road at 5am.  Took the I-10 to Palm Springs and
then Hwy. 62 thru 29 Palms to Parker, AZ.  Temps were great, with some storm
clouds a few miles to our south all the way to Parker.  Did you know that
someone burned down the Shoe Tree?!  Was planning on making a pit stop at
Ronnies in Havasu, but passed once the clouds broke and Havasu was hot as
hell.  Trucked on out to I-40 and hit some rain in Williams, AZ.  Made it to
the Fu ranch at about 3pm.  Settled in, checked the oil, chatted with Ricky,
JP, Greg from ABQ, and Rachel.  A little after dinner, Tom Buese showed up in
his DC from SLC.
We all chatted, Ricky and I did a grocery run and we all hit the sack.

Friday morning-JP, Greg and Rachel headed out pretty early, and the rest of us
took our sweet time heading out there.  We all loaded up and headed out.  I
decided to make the rest of the buses follow me down Schnebly Hill road into
Sedona from I-17.  I had read that it was a well-maintained forest road with
awesome views.  Well, awesome views were there, but it was pretty damn rough
and dusty.  My bus had a blast, but the others didnt seem as excited..hehe.
But Rickys Westy ran better after that road than before.  We stopped, looked
for missing hubcaps and parts, and then cruised to Jerome.  We got there
around 1:30pm.

Overall the weekend was great.  Dusty and hot at some intervals, but overall
great.  Great food, great people.  Won some plates on Sundays raffle and that
was it.  Was super stoked to see the t-shirt design I had illustrated a few
months ago.  The kids had a blast seeing friends they hadnt seen in quite
awhile.  Found a few parts and sold a few parts.  Met some new faces, and saw
some old faces.  Finally found Craig Koon on Sunday after searching for him
the entire weekend.  Harassed the Ellis clan for their long weekend.
Watched the drama of the bus raffle, then loaded up and headed out at around
130pm.  Hightailed it across the desert down 89, 71, then I-10 to So-Cal.  Did
most of the way thru AZ behind the Yuma contingent.  Made it home around 10pm,
with a parking lot lunch and a fast food sit-down dinner.

Used a few gallons of gas, a little bit of oil, and covered a lot of miles.
No problems, other than a pesky valve cover gasket, and the overhead vent
getting stuck open about an hour from home.  So far this was the second long
roadtrip with the new 60Std. And I have been pleased.  Everyone told me how
much I would hate the early walkthrough seat on a long trip, but I have found
it more comfortable than the 63EZ w/t seat.  Its wider, for my big ass, and
seems to be a lot more comfy.  I can also wedge my knee behind the steering
column for a makeshift cruise control.

As for the listees..Craig Koon, Van Bondo (kinda), JP, Ricky, Ronnie, Rachel,
Clara (never had the chance to say hi-sorry), Tom B..  I know there was a
bunch more.I also put some faces to alot of Sambanistas.

Forgot all about the digi-camera until Sunday morning, so the couple of pics I
did take are on thesamba_dot_com.

We had a blast, just wishing the drive out wasnt so damn hot!  Will we do it
again next year?.I hope so.  Octo and Havasu should be the next stops.  Kudos
to the ABC for another great show.

Beto
60Std.
