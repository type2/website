October 14, 2006 - Chirco's Pre-Show Free BBQ 
Tucson, Arizona 
Chirco Performance &amp; Restorations 
Bug-toberfest 2006 - Pre-Show Free BBQ Oct 14th 6:00pm till ,,,,,, 
9101 E. 22nd Street Tucson, AZ 
When is the last time the owner of one of the largest VW shops served you
dinner? 
Joe Chirco and his Father would like to treat you to a free BBQ here at the
shop. 
Last year we had a huge group air-cooled fans over to enjoy some great food
and fellowship the night before the show. It's our way of saying thanks to
the folks who have continued keeping us around for well over 20 years. 
So please join us in this relaxed setting and bring the family. 

Oh yeah, Don would like it if you bring some home made cookies. 

We are raising money and food for the Tucson community food bank, so all
donations are welcome. 

Camping next door to the show is free and on a first come first serve basis,
we have plenty of room. 

Any questions, please call us here toll free at 1-800-955-9795 or go to
