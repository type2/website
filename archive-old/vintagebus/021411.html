Subject: Re: [VB] Gas or vapor expanding in fuel tank?

Hi JD,
Bet when you installed the new sender you sealed what was not sealed before!  
This has made you bus safer, but now traps the gasolene vapor in the top of 
the tank and when it expands the fuel gets pressed out of the tank.  Best to 
fill your tank only just before you are going to travel at least 20 miles to 
burn up some of the fuel so it does not do what you are now experiencing.  
When ever parking with your fuel tank opening tilted uphill is a wise move 
when you have more than 3/4 full tank!  Eric&amp;Barb
