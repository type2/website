I just want to check with you all about the gear oil I just got for the
tranny in my 67 Westy.  I got Castrol Hypoy C SAE 80W-90.  It says it exceed
API GL-5 performance specifications.   I got 4 quarts.  Is that enough?  I
also got a fluid pump.  I've never changed the tranny and RGB oil before so
I'm just checking out the basic facts.  Anything I should be aware of?
Drain the center section first and then the RGB's?  I'll be putting it on a
lift out a military base where I used to work so I don't want to drain the
oil and then run into some suprise and not be able to drive it home.  Do the
drain plugs ever become stuck or crack or anything?  Well,  thanx for any
tips.  I shoudn't be so nervous about it I guess.
