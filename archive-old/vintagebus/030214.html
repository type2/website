I had a 61 Double Door panel that had a type four motor in it. It was running 34 or 36mm baby Dells on it. The previous owner had installed it and
done a pretty poor job. It had not been converted to an upright fan shroud, it simply utilized all of the type four shrouding. The bus was lowered
and had a bug tranny in it. The engine drove like a dream. It was like having an automatic in the bus. That motor would pull from 15 to 55 mph in
third gear. I could easily pass Subarus and other low powered vehicles on hills and the thing was quiet and smooth. Good luck on your adventure. I
would like to put one in the back of my 60 Double Cab some day but I just put in a new 1776 so it will be a while. A type 4 motor with a 911 shroud
conversion is my dream motor. I know that goes against a lot of you guys but there is nothing cooler looking than that 911 shroud and a set of dual
carbs.
I will be reading closely your trials and tribulations,
