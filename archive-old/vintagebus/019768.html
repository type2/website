So, everyone knows you're supposed to undo the nut on the driver's side front
wheel _clockwise_ right?  Right.  So I sit there turning it (turns pretty
easy!) and turning...take off the socket, and it's right where I started.  
Cue butterflies in stomach.  Socket back on, turn turn turn...socket off.
Hurray, stripped!  Not backing off at all!

So here's a meek call for help.  I need to obtain either one of these nuts or
one or two of the bay-window spindle nuts (the neat allen-head kind) so I can
hack saw THIS thing offa there, and get at the brake parts and bearings 
contained 'neath it.  I'm going to call Herrell VW in the morning to see if
they have one or the other that I can use.  Failing that, anybody near me have
one I can beg/buy/steal?  I am located 45 min south of Atlanta in Newnan, GA.
Pointers towards 'yards with bay-windows (Splits?  Ha!) that are nearby would
be appreciated too.  The hapless victim is a '67 Westy.

I should have spares, but I got rid of the extra front-end two weeks ago.
Urgency due to getting a job and having much more limited time to get the bus
going...really need to do it tommorrow to be certain of making it to the
Florida show.

I am this [ ] close to driving the Westy dang it!
