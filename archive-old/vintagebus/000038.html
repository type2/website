&lt;&lt; Hi E&amp;B,
I have a problem and I hope you can give me some insight into what might be 
wrong.&gt;&gt;
Hi David,
Sure and we are posting this to the list to see if anyone else has some 
ideas. 
  
&lt;&gt;
   Did you measure the clutch parts once they were installed before 
installing the engine to get the clutch cable adjusted properly?  Did you 
remove the shipping clips out of the clutch pressure plate?  It sounds like 
both of these might be your troubles.  Probably the former is too tight to 
allow the engine to turn the tranny input shaft.
  
&lt;&lt; Anyways, Im sure I will need to yank the engine back out, but would you 
have any thoughts on whats causing it to be so tight and why I dont have 
anything at all on my clutch ?      Thanks, David  &gt;&gt;
Probably best to remove the engine to do all of this easily.  Plus while in 
there make sure to check that the TO bearing is held by the throw out arm 
centered in relation to the tranny input shaft.  We just helped Steve Fronzic 
with his SO-44 westie.  The new throwout arm he installed about 6 months ago 
is just about worn out due to the bearing not being centered.  Due to this 
the pressure plate has woked the TO bearing side to side wearing/thinning the 
TO forks more and more.  Now the TO bearing clips barely hold the bearing in 
place.  Your welcome!  Hope this info has gotten back to you soon enough!
