I've used Varathane's &quot;Diamond Finish&quot; water-soluble product on several

well.  This is really tough stuff, a breeze to work with, and almost no
fumes/odor.

&gt;&gt;  My Robert Davis exclusive wood strips had about 6 coats of UV resistant
urethane spar stuff on 'em and it broke down and wore off in one year.  &lt;&lt;
