1800 lbs is an easy load.  Go to vintagebus_dot_com and look in the gallery
under &quot;Working Busses&quot;.  You'll see lots of pics of heavily-loaded busses
and trucks (even mine).

&gt;I was doubting the power of the 1600 dp
&gt;that is in my 65 double cab , until 
&gt;I saw the previous owner about a month ago and he said 
&gt;in discussion that he had the double cab loaded with 
&gt;nearly one ton in the back of the pick up 
&gt;he described it as 25 bags of quickcrete
&gt;and a load of gravel on the back side of it .
&gt;
&gt;he claims that it was roughly 1800 lbs. of weight
&gt;can this possibly be trude he also stated that it was not a problem when 
&gt;he had to stop at the red light at the  bottom of the steep hill in town 
&gt;claim is that it just went right up the hill   ?   imagine that ?
