Clara's right! Even if you convert to 12 volt, you'll still have all the same issues...and unless you're pumping 12 v through corroded lines to 6 v components (and risking frying them in the process), the 12 volt conversion will still seem tired until you clean off terminals and eliminate corrosion.

Personally, the only reason I've ever converted to 12v is the practical question of &quot;who can give me a jump if I'm at 6 volts?&quot; I've since learned that there are some tricks that will allow this as well.

Good luck! Joe
