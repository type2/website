&gt; hey all,
&gt; I recently picked up a 66 standard bus that I've
&gt; been working on, but it is 
&gt; missing the &quot;black box&quot; that runs all of the brake
&gt; lights and everything. 
&gt; Being, as I am, new to the world of VW's, I am
&gt; having a very hard time 
&gt; locating a new one. I was also wondering if it is in
&gt; any way possible to 
&gt; wire my bus without one&lt;&lt;

matt roberds has an EXCELLENT article on how to
replace this no longer available(?) part using
inexpenseive relays from you local auto parts. Heres
