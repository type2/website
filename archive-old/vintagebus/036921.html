&gt;     Does the 67 DC have an odd master cylinder?  Mine has a double

&gt; res. single switch m.c. ???

no this is not odd.   virtually all (excpet for the first month or so) of 67 came with the dual master cylinder.  this is a safer system, because if a rear cylinder goes out, you still have front brakes, and vice versa.  Some people convert their single circuit master cylinders to the dual version.

yes the 67 dual circuit MCs cost more.   but isn't your safety worth it?
