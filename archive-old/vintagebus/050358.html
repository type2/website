Hi all...
    I am new to the list.
Yesterday I got my 58th VW.  A 1962 Deluxe 15 window.
Engine is not stock.  Wheels are not stock.
I would like a stock interior.
Problem is I only have the front seat.  Everything else is missing.
No radio, ashtray, clock, O. Schitt Handle, middle seat, rear seat,
jail bars, rear window, Headliner, panels, NOTHING inside, but the driver's
bench...  I need it all...  Anybody got any of this? Or can I see yours
so I can make copies or get ideas?
I have been reading this reduction box thread.
I want mine gone.  I have a new stock tranny. 4.13. I have a 1600 dual port.
Yesterday on flat ground with pedal to the floor in 4th I got almost 40mph.
I need 65 at 3000rpm.  My bug does that, My Notch did that.
Ruduction boxes won't let this happen whatever math I use.

I'm here...
