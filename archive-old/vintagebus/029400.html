Subject: [VB] Busses by the Sea

Well, at last, you West Coast doooooods can eat your hearts out!! he he.

Busses by the Sea was a blast. Special kudos to Emmitt for putting this
thing togaether. And, I was totally wrong about the mosquitos. Only got
one bite all weekend.

The bonfire was fantastic, although I was only able to stsy a few
minutes (sick eight year old).

Met a lot of great folks. . . . looking forward to the next event. I
think that is Busses by the Bay. If anyone has info about this, I would
appreciate it.

Les
