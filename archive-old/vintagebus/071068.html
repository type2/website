Subject: Re: [VB] missing M-code plate

If you send your VIN off and get a birth certificate for your bus, it'll say
on there what options your bus was ordered with.

&gt; My M-code plate is missing.  It actually was never there when I got the
bus.
&gt; Is there a way to discern any of the M-code info from the VIN?
