Hi All,

I got my tipper yesterday from Belgium.  The 6 hour trip (each way) up and
back over several mountain passes was mainly uneventful.  I started a new
web site for the truck and posted a few pictures on vintagebus_dot_com... just
search for 'David Mayes'  This thing has 'patina'!

More to come as I get this thing on the road in the next few weeks.  I've
already ordered the needed brake parts from Ronnie (thanks for the great
service Ronnie).
