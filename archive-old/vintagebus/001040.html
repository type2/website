Get new drums (Ron Salmon has these listed at $49.95 at his website
http://www.busdepot_dot_com/under.htm).

Or try the Timesert (http://www.timesert_dot_com/) method.  These are threaded
inserts that allow you to re-use the old bolts.  The kits are about $60 and
come with everything you need to make the repair, including 5 inserts.

Good luck,

&gt;Mike asked,
&gt;
&gt; I have one stripped lug bolt hole on each of my rear drums.  Any way to
&gt; repair this?  Or am I stuck buying new drums?  (58 single cab with
&gt; big-nut rears)
