Subject: Re: [VB] bias plys?

I'm still running the 25-yr-old Firestone 700x14 8-ply mud and snow
tires on my 67 DC that the PO left on it--there are years worth of tread
left since I only drive it on weekends.  I'm doing fine with them
although they do tend to grab the ruts in those old Pennsylvania
two-lanes a bit too much and make me fight the steering wheel.  When I
emailed Firestone about them last year requesting more info, they said
take them off NOW!!  I suppose they were imagining another F*ord
Explorer disaster.

&gt; Anyone running bias plys on a regularly driven vehicle? If so how is it? how
&gt; do they compare to radials?    I won't be driving it in the rain/snow so
&gt; that isn't an issue for me.
&gt; Also I've heard of radials that look like bias plys but haven't found
&gt; anything with a black wall that truely looks like a bias ply tire. Anyone
&gt; else heard of these and/or know where I can get some?
