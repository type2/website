w.r.t.
    ...
    The essence of the California bill, is that if the car is sent in
    as part of the Accelerated Vehicle Retirement program (voluntary,
    or not) it is crushed.  Parts cannot be taken from any vehicle that
    is to be scrapped under the program.
    ...

is it kosher for me to part a car out and then
get it crushed?  how much money is the &quot;crush me&quot;
transaction worth?

in other words, given that economics rules what
are the economics?
