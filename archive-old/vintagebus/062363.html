George, that rips it. I'm pulling my kids and grandkids out of school and
sending them to your house. What's your address and how much clothes should
I pack !

Thanks for the back up, prof

&gt; With a 12.5lb flywheel and C/W crank you are keeping stock weight through
&gt; the reciprocating mass, but in different locations.  Basically what you
&gt; steel from the flywheel you are adding to the crank, but in better places
to
&gt; help reduce crank &quot;whip&quot;.

Take care with the idea of &quot;weight&quot; here.  The flywheel property that is
important is its moment of inertia (resistance to change in rotation)
which is affected by the location of the mass relative to the rotational
axis.

Caution:  Physics ahead (but it's _fun_ physics)

The equation in interest is I=mr^2 where I is the moment of inertia, m is
the mass and r is the
distance of the mass from the center of rotation.

Let's say, for example, we get a counterweighted crank that adds 4.0kg at
a distance of 10cm (0.1m) from the centerline of the crank.  This would
add a moment of inertia of 3*0.1^2 = 0.04kg-m^2

Now, let's say that we want to lighten the flywheel to compensate for this
increased moment in the crank.

The outer rim of the flywheel is, IIRC, about 20cm from the center of
rotation.  To reduce the moment of iertia of the flywheel by the same
amount that the crank picked up you have to remove .04 = m(.2^2) or
m=1.0kg.

In short, you have to remove only 1/4 the mass from the flywheel as you
added to the crank, since the flywheel has a large radius.

If you take the same mass away from the flywheel as you add to the crank
(or torsonal damper) you will end up with much less moment of inertia and
therefore less &quot;flywheel effect.&quot;

Class dismissed.  Note the new homework on the board and be ready
for the test tomorrow...
