Sounds like a correct early westfalia.  If it is, its
a quite rare bus and fairly valueable.  Make sure you
save every liitle piece or part you find or have with
the bus.  As this early westy stuff is next to
impossible to find if you lose it!  Just ask Thom how
hard findin correct parts is!

Nice find!...How about some pics?

&gt; Hi all, we just got a '57 kombi (I think, has three
&gt; popouts on each side) with some kind
&gt; of camper conversion inside. Our question is how can
&gt; we tell who manufactured the kit, or
&gt; was this some kind of home built thing? I can't find
&gt; any kind of sticker or plate anywhere
&gt; on the bus IDing it. Right behind the front bench is
&gt; a small dinette? that makes into a
&gt; bed and in the back is a little cabinet with a
&gt; couple of doors. there's also a small
&gt; cabinet right at the front behind the passenger
&gt; seat. wood paneling covers the sides and
&gt; roof. Any ideas on what this might be?
&gt; 
&gt; The bus is very straight, and rust free, just some
&gt; dents here and there, and the passenger
&gt; door is rusted out at the bottom of the door, but
&gt; the floor is solid and still has what
&gt; looks like the factory primer, and under it looks
&gt; just as good. someone did cut the rear
&gt; bumper for a later 1600 bug engine and muffler
&gt; 
&gt; Over all I think that we got a fun little bus to
&gt; work on :)
&gt; 
&gt; I'll try to get some pic's up soon so you all can
&gt; take a good look at it :)
