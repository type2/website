&gt;How do I get a copy of this book?  I have heard a lot of it and wondered
where
&gt;I should send money and how much.  Is the club selling it direct, or do I
have
&gt;to go through a publisher or bookstore?  

Dan,

To get your copy of the Split Screen Specification Guide you send your 
check made out to NEATO to:

NEATO
P.O. Box 4190
Albuquerque, NM  87196

The cost is $17 for NEATO members, $20 for non-NEATO members.  You can 
become a NEATO member by sending $20 to the same address.

If you want more info on NEATO, send me your address &amp; I will send you 
a sample copy of our newsletter, Old Bus Review.

Dave
