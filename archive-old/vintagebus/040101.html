well, we either send the dogs after 'em (the gophers), or throw cresent 
wrenches at them from atop the tractors, but that got pretty expensive after 
a while  ;)

Tuesday, after we drive home the 2001 turbo diesel New Beetle!)

cool

hey, does anyone know a good way
to kill gophers other than shooting the f*#kers?

 &gt; Ok.  I know I'm asking for alot of &quot;yeah rights&quot;, but here it is.  What
is
 &gt; the fastest you have ever gotten your bus to? and have you ever gotten a
 &gt; speeding ticket on the open highway?  Please back up the high numbers
with
 &gt; hardware.
