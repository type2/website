Well SOB - it appears that the rebuild book has misinformation in it then.
As I gather it, I must have the dizzy gear off 90 degrees.  Damn that book -
I followed it to a 'T' and all it nets me is B.S. - I'll go out to the shop
tonight and see what's up.  Maybe it's not so far off that I can't use it as
it is.  I'm glad I'm getting this out of the way.  I'll know on the next
rebuild what I like or prefer to do and I can throw my damn books in the
garbage can! :-)
