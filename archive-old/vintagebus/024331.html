Subject: Oil Strainer Gasket, was Re: Tech Question
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

Treating the oil strainer gasket with gasket shellac 
may not be such a great idea, as it tends to become 
hard with time and apparently hard to remove at overhaul time. 
Apparently it works for Kyle though, YMMV. 

If you are using a full flow external oil filter, you won't 
need to remove the cover for long period of time and a 
different approach may be in order, such as an elastomeric 
sealant of some sort, such as a spray. 

However, what I've always done is much simpler, and
much more . .uh . . tactile . . . .
learned sometime long long ago . . . . . . 
maybe I wanted to continue playing with mud . . 

I apply a thin layer of grease to both sides of the gasket. 
Skooge a little onto your thumb and index finger, place 
gasket between and CAREFULLy pull/turn the gasket through 
your greasy finger/thumb, it feels so good. Keep the 
layer thin and let it sit for awhile to soak in. Rub 
off any excess and install. 

Rather than just say &quot;this is what I do&quot; 
I'll include a &quot;why I think this works&quot; too. 

Paper gaskets absorb oil over time and eventually ooze oil. 
Applying a thicker material (grease) blocks 
the thinner oil. It also helps hold the gaskets in 
place while getting gasket/strainer/gasket/cover 
in place while reaching for the out of reach nuts.

&gt; &gt;I changed the oil in my 65 Splittie (once again, first time) and 
&gt; bought a 
&gt; &gt;new oil screen with gaskets. When I put the new gaskets and oil 
&gt; screen in 
&gt; &gt;and tightened it down, and added the oil, it started leaking around 
&gt; the 
&gt; &gt;seal..... Question: Are you suppose to get the the cardboard gasket 
&gt; wet 
&gt; &gt;first ? Put gasket sealant on it ? Use a different type of gasket 
&gt; other 
&gt; &gt;than cardboard ? 
&gt; 

Kyle responded: 
&gt; Paper and cardboard gaskets need to be sealed before using. Hoover's 
&gt; 'sermons' had a good one about this. I use Indian Head Gasket Shellac, 
&gt; paint 
&gt; it on the gasket and let it dry. I'm sure others can write in and 
&gt; explain 
&gt; why you would never want to do this, or that you should use spit, 
&gt; or shoe 
&gt; polish or whatever.
