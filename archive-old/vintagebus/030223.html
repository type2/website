Subject: M-codes on the Single

I have all the m-codes decoded except
426 and 796

I ran it into the registry on Thom's site and got possible US spec for
426 and nothing for 796 Destination was Los Angeles, but it still has
all the original Euro spec stuff that I know was there when it was
picked up at the dealer because I saw pictures the owner had from when
he bought it.

Any ideas??

Greg
