Hi Jim
You're building about the same engine NQ and I did.  He went with Weber 48 
IDEs I think.  I ran a Weber progressive that was so lean I couldn't push 
her over 60 mph for any amount of time.  Got 25 mpg though....  No one was 
forthcoming with jetting help and I was running outta time so I tried the 
Kadrons.

You will find that the 044 big valve heads are not the ideal head for a bus. 
  I've been running 044s, 110 cam, various exhausts.  The trouble with big 
valve heads is that although they flow well, the charge velocity is rather 
low at the rpms buses typically drive.  They breathe well at 4k+ rpm, but 
real world driving rarely supports 4000 - 5500 rpm.

Out of the box the Kadrons were jetted ok for my 1776.  Be advised though 
that they do not have chokes.  If you drive your bus daily (you do, don't 
you?) and it gets colder than 35 degrees your bus will not be happy until 
the heads and intake tract heat up.  Less than 20 degrees and the top end 
runs way too cold.  They do not have vacuum ports for a distributor so you 
get to live with the mechanical advance beast, unless you drill the carb and 
intake manifold for vacuum ports.  Modifying out of the box carbs just so 
they'll work right just doesn;t make sense to me.  You can set your timing 
and adjust the carbs to eliminate most all the stumble, but it will be 
there.  The throttle shaft runs wear quickly too so be ready to pull them 
after a while to get them bushed.  Trial by error, and judicious use of the 
Archives will guide you in your quest.

When I build the next bus engine, it will likely be a 'stock 1776', single 
port, clean up the ports a bit, 205 dizzy, stock exhaust, balanced as best I 
can, full flowed for filtration, doghouse w/type2 cooler.  Either a Pict 30 
or maybe a single 40 IDE for a carb.

Of course it's YOUR bus, put whatever you want in it.  Let us know how it's 
going.
