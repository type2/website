&gt; Well for a couple of bucks most photo development shops will put any pic
&gt; onto a 3.5 disk and then you could upload it...or you could pass the camera

getting the disk is no prob, my reg photo lab does it, BUT what I said and
many people do not get is &quot;This is a WORLD WIDE&quot; newsgroup.  many people
cannot or for one reason or another do not have a link that allows
graphics.  if you can't send it in PINE, UNIX, or LYNX it can't get there.
why do you think this as well as most newsgroups do not allow attachments
or graphics of any kind.

photos are no problem, getting them on or being able to see em on the web
is the problem.

who views the World Wide Web, in white type on a black screen!

&gt; &gt;good idea, BUT not all of us have access to a graphics capable site
