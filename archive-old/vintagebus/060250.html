Subject: Re: [VB] solid slider felts

Me too! I wondered if anyone else had bought from JCW. My channels were good
quality as well as was the other rubber I bought. My pieces had WCM labels
all over them though. I remember pricing the same pieces through WCM and
figured-out I saved over $150.00 buying it though JCW.

it

with

worth.
