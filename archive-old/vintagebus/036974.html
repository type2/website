 Kerry from New Mexico came through Havasu yesterday on his way back to New
 Mexico from Oakland, Cal. with his newly aquired 1962 Double Door
 Walkthrough panel, it was a very clean bus and puts another double door in
 the books, it seems that double doors are starting to become popular or
 thats all thats left out there in good condition anymore. I have 1, VWhoward
 has 1 and just sold his other 1, Kerry, Thom, Johnney S, Mike and the list
 goes on, will make a great picture at the Classic if we all show up (hint
 hint Thom) there together, maybe Thom will be in another mag shot!
 
 Anyway the strange thing in Kerrys walkthrough was the way the drivers seat
 was mounted, it had stock slider mounts on the outside of the pedestal and
 on the walkthrough side it had a bolt on bracket with the seat adjuster
 built into it. I have never noticed a movable seat in a 62 before (or i
 never paid any attention), but this was a really cool set-up. Kerry said
 that he will either post some photo's of it, or send some to me to post.
 
 PSS, a friend of mine who owns a 21 window deluxe, was wondering where the
 water drains to from his sunroof.

 I was wierded out when I first saw a sliding seat in a 62.  BUt actually it 
was standard equipment.  It is different than the 63-67 sliding drivers seat, 
the adjustment handle is on the side.  dont know if a 63-67 seat will fit the 
rails, one of which is screwed to the bus.  The 62 walkthough (not bench) 
buses had them- well circa 62 I don't think it coincides exactly with model 
year.
