&gt;Does anyone have a source, either overseas or in the U.S. for glass in
METRIC
&gt;thickness?
&gt;...
&gt;
I don't know the answer but in last month's Volksworld, the owner of the '52
Panel in there mentioned doing exactly what you have mentioned for Barndoor
windshields.  Perhaps he can be contacted?

My '54 Truck had U.S. thickness windshields, I suspect the originals were
the subject of a face plant from a *serious* front end impact.  They
appeared to fit correctly.

Regards,
Everett &quot;Would like some new Barndoor windshields himself&quot; Barnes
