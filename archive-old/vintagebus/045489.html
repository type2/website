&lt;&lt; I can't explain it, but the splash pans from the original (truck) bumper
fit nicely on the repro bus bumper that I put on Rosie. I wish I had hung onto
that old bumper now. I thought they were the same.

Hi,
From 1959-1963 the bus &amp; truck rear bumpers are the same animal.  Only the
splash pans are different.   Eric &amp; Barb
