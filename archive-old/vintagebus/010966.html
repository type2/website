&gt;  In looking at a photo of a '63 DC for sale on ebay, I noticed a photo of
&gt;  a step for the rear passenger door.

&gt;  
&gt;  Is this an &quot;ambulance step&quot; thats been fitted to the double cab?
&gt;  
&gt;  Did the DCs come with this step as an option?
&gt;  
&gt;  An Enquiring Mind wants to know... :-)

yup, looks like someone put a step on the DC.  VW would put a step on any bus 
you wanted as an extra.  they were standrd on ambulances, extra on anything 
else
