&lt;&lt; Once before I asked about the similarity of parts from a bay window and now
 I'm coming with some more. It looks like split and bay have some
 similarities after all. In my area it's not very common to find a bus at a
 grave yard but after visiting one today I found two 70ish bugs and a 73 bay
 camper - some kind of conversion with a white top. Sprtsmen? Sprting?
 something like that. The interior on this baby is in pretty good condition
 and it would be a shame if I let it go this way into the crusher. 69 just
 went in today, unfortunately. Would this interior fit my 64? Panels look
 close and it is a walkthrough so....... Even has all the floor mats in and a
 Z-bed. Would a front rubber floor mat fit the Split? Engine sits inside and
 it's in pretty bad shape. I'm wondering how much these guys will charge?
 There was an 82 Westfalia in very good condition as well, now this interior
 I would want to see in mine, stove, sink, nice bed well too bad all these
  &gt;&gt;

the interior size is differnet between a split and a later bus.... but if you 
are reasonably handy at carpentry you can modify things to fit.  think the 
width is the same, but the length behind the cargo doors is shorter.   Rear 
floor mats fit the same, the holes are differnt.  late Z bed goes right in 
w/o mods, and the supports are sturdier in fact.  but the long so 42 cabinet 
froma bay must be mofied to fit a split.  Bay roof panels are not as wide, 
unfortunately, so there would be gaps, and the rear one has to be cut short.  
I put bay westy roof wood in my 65 covering the thrashed original that was 
brush painted brown, ugly it is, and falling, the bay panelling shows a gap 
of a few inches, but vastly improved the interior.
