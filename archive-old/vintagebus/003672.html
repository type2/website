Subject: Carb needed for 1835 cc
Date: Thu, 22 Jun 2000 21:56:33 -0400
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

Hi all
A friend of mine has a new 1835,, he has been sitting on it for years, and
finally wants to Drive his VW
Problem is ,, he put some Dellorto Carb on it, and it won't run,, lots of
people have told him the carb he bought is from a 2 carb set and it is the
wrong one to use as a single carb

He wants to buy something that he can basically bolt on,,

Does anyone have a carb set up?  Dual, single,,??
everything that is required, that would get him out on the road

Thanks!   What else can I tell you that is pertinant to sizing tuning this
carb or finding a carb that is satisfactory?
