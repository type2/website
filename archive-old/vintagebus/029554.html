If I spent twelve big for an old bus I'd do anything I wanted to do
with it.  Up to and including installing the baddest sound system I
could find and cutting a hole in the roof and welding a bug top to it
and hitting the Phish tour!  

After the title is transfered the FORMER owner has absolutely NO say.
