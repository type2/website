Subject: Re: [VB] Jalosy vs. EZ windows was Kill copyright/web-geek thread?

That's pretty good! Jealousy vs. envy type windows may be the question that 
leads to the down fall of man!:) Anyway, the subject of camper windows is 
very much on the forefront of my restoration project on my '62 EZ Camper 
right now. I have a set of 5 HEHR windows that came on both EZ and Sundial 
camper conversions, I don't know what to call them, (jealousy or envy?) I 
believe that jalosy windows are the louvered windows with 3 or 4 separate 
panes, correct me if I am wrong? I my assumptions are right, I do not have 
those, but I have the single hinge windows that have the operator track 
running down the middle of the single pane of glass.

What I am hoping to find out is:

1. Should I fix all the operators of this set of windows? Or should I trade 
them or buy a set of functional jalosy louvered type windows to use in their 
place? Are the windows that I have rare?

2. Does anyone know where I can get the hardware to fix these windows? I 
have a couple leads but I would like to hear what the list has to say.

This will really help me to make a decision about what I should do.

Thanks,
Joshua

&gt;Folks, can we kill this discussion of who rips off images, how to rip them 
&gt;off, how to delude yourself into thinking you won't be ripped off, etc.?  
&gt;Yes, you're talking
&gt;about images of busses, but otherwise the content is vintagebus-free, isn't 
&gt;it?  I mean, are discussion of xerography topical?
&gt;
&gt;Sorry, I just deal with this stuff at work all the time and would like to 
&gt;see this list stay on topic.  Let's hear more about jealousy windows, for 
&gt;example!  My
&gt;pseudowesty has, instead, those envy-type windows because someone was 
&gt;(naturally) hoarding the jealousy windows that year.  The mfr tried to 
&gt;obtain a set of
&gt;covetousness windows but they were on back order.
