Watched 'Casino Royale' last night.  They used a brand new
single cab to tote the bomb carrying grouse launcher
to the fields to go after David Niven (James Bond 007).

The tracking device was flung back at the launcher
and thus blew up the single cab.  Cheesy special effects
tell me that the truck actually survived.  They showed the
side gate being lowered.  Very cool scene, showing off
the virtues of a single cab, even in the hands of evil.
