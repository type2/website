what a killer show. Found lots of kool items to drain my wallet.  A few of
the things I picked up were a &quot;light-up D plate&quot; from the Germans, and a
Swedish dealer VW flag. Also picked up 2 packages of NOS wiper arms (more on
those in my future post entitled : &quot;what the hell year are these for?&quot; or as
the Arizonans say &quot; what the hell are these FOR&quot; ;)
Everett was there pimpin his goodies and I saw Thom's yellow
submarine,although I never saw Thom. I was gonna jump on the &quot;give Thom
royalties for showing up to a VW show&quot; bandwagon, and give him a NOS hazet
tool kit, but alas, I never saw him. maybe next time :)
I threw up a picture of the kool firetruck display with optional mannequins
and a fire trailer, as well as a seafoam green and white 21 deluxe I saw
when I was crusin back to AZ on the freeway. G/F was bored and had 1 pic
left in the camera.  A long distance listee driver perhaps?  If so, hes got
ballz cause I didn't see a license plate...

I can throw up more pics if anyone wants, but im sure everett will have the
full deal on his site anyways.
