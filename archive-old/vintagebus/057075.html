Why not just buy one from &quot;The Mint&quot; ?  They are
coming out with a new one in about 2 months.

&gt; &gt; Bid High ($90.00) the first time and hope for the

&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Ok,, there has to be someone who will sell me a FM
&gt; Bus privately! I'll
&gt; &gt; never win an auction with dial up connection! Them
&gt; guys squeeze me at
&gt; &gt; the last second...
&gt; 
&gt; Jamie,
&gt; That sounds like good advice to me.  I checked the
&gt; completed auctions on ebay
&gt; and found two recently closed, both between $80 and
&gt; $85.  Bid $90 and sit back.
&gt; Here's one you can have a crack at
&gt;
http://cgi.ebay_dot_com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&amp;item=1087120857
&gt; 
&gt; OR
&gt; you could round up a friend with a DSL connection
&gt; and have them try and bid for
&gt; you
&gt; 
&gt; OR
&gt; you can subscribe to one of those auction bidding
&gt; services where it will
&gt; automatically post your bid at the very last second.
&gt;  You don't even have to be
&gt; around.  Snoozing away and winning bids.
&gt;
