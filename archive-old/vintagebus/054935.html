Subject: Long Sitting Buss..2!

Howdy, all, 
I'm a new member to this mailing list, and join you
all in sort of a rough time. I'm in the process of
restoring a 64 Kombi that has been sitting 14 years.
After a month or two, I just got the engine running
yesterday. Now, however, I notice a knocking in the
engine. I was wondering if any of you had some ideas
for what this may be. I haven't checked the cylinder
head bolt, which was my only guess. I'd appreciate all
the help I could get, in both this matter and general
suggestions when getting a car that has been sitting
this long into driving condition. 
Thanks, James
