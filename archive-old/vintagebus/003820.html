So I can see now why my brakes seemed odd.  The seals didn't seal!  Should
there be something that prevents the seals from going all the way to the
backing plates?  From the plate there is a spacer, the seal rides right on
top of that, then there is a bearing then the wheel.  Should there be
something between the spacer and the bearing that prevents the seal from
going all the way to the backing plate.  This is surely wrong.  Both of my
front drums have tons of grease in them.
