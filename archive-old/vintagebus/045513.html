 hi clara,
 
 I'm not sure if he did put a ground strap on or not, thats why i bring it
 up... But really he has just had poor running problems since the swap,
 and the tranny has the same gear ratios as his old one i think...
 
 He has gone through everything, and his engine is pretty fresh, it just
 wont run right, thats why i thought of the ground strap as a possible
 culprit...
 
 take care,
 
 Steve

er- there could maybe be a loose wire or maybe the spark plug wires got mixed 
up- remember 1-4-3-2.  I would check that the ground strap is there and none 
of the wires are loose if I was him.
