Subject: Re: [VB] 1950 - 1962 Bentley Workshop Manual

&gt;From: Thom Fitzpatrick &lt;thom_at_calweb_dot_com&gt;

&gt;
&gt;I just got an email from Bentley, and the 1950 - 1962 bus Workshop 
&gt;Manual is a &quot;go&quot; with a release date around September 2002.

Cool!  I didn't realize it was going to go all the way back; I thought
it was going to be post-barndoor coverage only.  But that's a good
thing and expands the potential market a little bit.

As for the price, they sell the '63-'67 book for $100 on their Web site,
but it is commonly available cheaper than that from various vendors.
I imagine the $110 list will be about the going rate for a little while,
until some of the vendors discount it.  I'm going to buy one as soon as
they are available -- I have never regretted having the factory shop
manual for any car I have owned.

One interesting note from their site, it looks like they are just
&quot;Bentley&quot; now instead of &quot;Robert Bentley&quot;.
