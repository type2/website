propted by a bit of discussion on the tII list...
I noticed that mcode 191 subfloors is only listed for 2 busses in thoms
registry. is this a standard item in sunroof deluxes and not needing a
mcode. can someone tell me which busses would have had the subfloors
welded in.

P.S.-  I asked my wife to give my new bus a name and she said how about
&quot;piece of crap money sponge&quot;.  Ouch!  That hurts.
