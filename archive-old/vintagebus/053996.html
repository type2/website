Subject: Re: [VB] Strangest injuries

My weird one was in making a new lead hammer
A hole was drilled in the side of the soup can for the handle and the contents drained out
lead melted and poured into the can
then like a dummy, I thrust the pipe into the can.
Hot molten lead and cold pipe do not mix.

Instant geyser of molten lead all across the inside of my wrist and forearm.
3rd degree burns and other nice stuff.

I can completely sympethize with your current induced pain.

&gt; Last night I was working on the engine and had my left arm across the top when my steel watchband crossed the terminals on the alternator. It welded the links together and burnt my right thumb while I was trying to rip it off my wrist. A 3&quot; by 1&quot; patch of skin came off as one piece, except for the skin that came off today all crackly. HAHAHAHAHAHAHAH! Of course, my busspouse was standing there and thought I was gonna lose my arm.

&gt; That's the dumbest thing I've done since when I was trying to get an old tie rod off and was banging on a prybar, I hit myself square on the forehead with a four pound sledge. My wife missed that one, but later had to ask why I had a big knot on my head.
