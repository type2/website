Subject: Re: [VB] Kristen Laurite - AIRS

Hello Guys  As one of the last people to have seen her alive I was  shocked 
to see this posted today  .  What great news that the scum was finally located 
.  Everytime I open the AIRS list I am reminded how very pretty and nice she 
was and how I wish she had listened to me when I told her to go back home that 
it was too dangerous to travel alone across the USA . Hindsight will always 
have 20-20 vision. As has been said thank god for some closure and If you aren't 
on the AIRS list sigh up and if you are make sure that the info is correct 
and updated ..  Later and have fun  Mark Dearing
