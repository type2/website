&gt;The other day i changed the fuel line from the tank to the metal hose
&gt;at the engine, and didn't see a good way to route it.  [...]  No clips
&gt;or hangers are visible, and i can't imagine it should be as haphazard
&gt;as what i have done.

On my '64 Standard, the hose comes out of the tank and goes towards the
rear just an inch or two.  Then it runs across the Bus, clipped to the
&quot;roof&quot; of the underside (actually the bottom side of that shelf that
the tank sits on).  There are clips - short pieces of metal maybe 0.5&quot;
wide and 1.5&quot; long - welded to the body for this.  Above and a little
outboard of the clutch arm, it comes down and clamps onto the end of
the metal fuel line that comes through the engine front tin there.

I'm still not totally convinced that the part the crosses the Bus and
is clipped to the body shouldn't be metal line, with short pieces of
hose at each end to connect to the tank and the line from the engine.
But what I've got seems to work, so far.
