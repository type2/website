What do you guys think about eBay sellers asking for tax on their purchases?  I had 
one ebay seller do that, and when I asked for his FTB tax ID, I never heard back.  Sounds 
like a good scam to get an extra 7% or better on the sale of your goods.  Even if you 
paid it, there's probably no way to validate that it actually goes to Uncle Gray, is there?
