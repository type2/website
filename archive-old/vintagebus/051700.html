Subject: RE: [VB] Front Shocks????

The guy was obviously a counter guy. He knew nothing about VW's. All
transporters untill Vanagan had double eyelet shocks. In fact, in a pinch, I
have used shocks off of a 74 on my 67 SC. Call him back, explain to him that
he is mistaken, have him actually read the correct line in the catalog for
the correct part number. If that doesn't work, colorful expleteives could be
inserted at that point.

Subject: [VB] Front Shocks????


OK here's another question;  I ordered from Shocks from a Bus parts company.
The shock that came has an eyelet in the bottom and a stud top (that goes
through a hole and accepts a nut)  I  called to tell them they sent the
wrong shock.  I order the shock from them to fit a 57 to 67 Bus.  They tell
me what I received is the correct shock for a 67 Bus.  My 66 has a shock
that has an eyelet on each end.  They als tell me that they've sold 1000's
of these shock and had none returned.  So if this is the correct shock.
What's going on with my frontend?  The picture in the Bently shows a shock
with eyelits on both ends.  They tell me the Haynes shows the shock on 67
like the one they sent me.  

This is in no means to slam anyone.  I had a big order that was received
fast and everything else was there.  I'm just confused on how this shock
fits a Splitwindow Bus.
