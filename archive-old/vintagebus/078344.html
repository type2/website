&gt;three spade fittings # 54d-31b-54 It's my guess this is a 6 volt
&gt;motor??

Hard to say.  From those numbers, I can tell you that it's not just a
single-speed motor.  &lt;dig around&gt;  Aha!  You seem to have the rather
rare '65 only single-speed self-parking motor.  The wiring diagram
for a '66 _Bug_ will show you how to hook it up.

It could be either 6 V or 12 V.  There's a fairly high chance that
it's 6 V, but the parts list does list this motor in a 12 V version
for the 12 V option you could get at the time.

&gt;after taking it apart there's smaller fiber gear, it appears not be
&gt;attached to any thing other than to join the larger gear...

It should be on a shaft, yes.  Also, dig around in the grease for
the tiny thrust washer that goes on one of the shafts (I can't
remember if it goes on the fiber gear shaft or not.)
