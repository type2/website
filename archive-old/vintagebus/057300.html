Subject: Timing for altitude: was--My trip to Time-Fastener

The spec I'm familiar with is one degree of advance
for every thousand feet of elevation above sea level. 
But here in Albuquerque (5000 ft), I just time to 30+
max advance, and figure I'm OK anywhere.  I had to
switch to premium at last year's OCTO/Classic weekend
only because I got my compression ratio too high in my
1776.

&gt; &gt; I had the pleasure of speaking to some guys from
&gt; Colorado and they told me 
&gt; &gt; that they advanced the timing in order to run
&gt; better at high altitudes.

&gt; Hi Sean,
&gt; Makes sense!  With lower CR due to high altitude one
&gt; should be able to 
&gt; advance the timing.  The next question is, how much
&gt; and when to dial it back?
