Subject: Re: [VB] clutch cable broke?...NOT
To: zundapp_at_prodigy_dot_net, vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

First of all there is alot of the cable you cannot see, so check to make sure 
the cable works by crawling under the bus with a flashlight and watching the 
arm on the tranny, while your friend steps on the clutch.  If the arm moves 
enought, the cable would be fine.  If the arm does not move at all your cable 
 is probably bad.  If the arm on the tranny fell off, that would be obvious 
too.  But if it springing all the way up on the floor, it is probably good.  
Does adjusting help?

You can pull the motor and see if the throw out arm is broken.  not that big 
a deal to replace it.   I would use this opportunity to replace the fuel 
line, change the tranny oil (including RGBoxes), install a new engine to body 
seal, replace the engine main seal and oil cooler seals,  or any other of 
those upkeep things which is a lot easier with the motor out.  If you hadn't 
already done them.

Ya a broken Throw out arm feels like you are driving and the clutch feels 
normal, then next time you press down and it does not do the clutch,  springs 
back up fine, feels a little lighter pressing down though.  And suddenly you 
are thinking the way home with the fewest lights/stop signs

&lt;&lt; I thought I had a busted the clutch cable yesterday but
 it turned out to be fine. That's because I actually had an extra
 with me. The pedal went to the floor without the
 normal resistance but still would spring back up but with no clutch action.
 I got a crash course in clutchless driving as I
 held up traffic a little when I couldn't get it into first at a stop sign.
 I'm guessing the fork deal
 that holds the throw out bearing is busted somehow.
 I have not pulled the engine yet
 to take a look at it.
 What is involved with this repair?
 Does this part have to pressed in?
 Any advice is appreciated.
