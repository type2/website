friday topic i suppose. I lived in Oregon for a short time and i was aware of
their gas pumping situation, you cannot pump your own gas. Attendant must do
it. I was curious to any stories the list have about how they deal with
this,and anyone ever have an attendant fill their Barndoor up? i dont like
the &quot;law&quot; and if i go back there with my BD i just want to see if there are
alternatives. i am very protective to my investment and dont want any grease
monkeys ripping my decklid off to fill my tank,provided they know where the
filler is in the first place.In my experience, they dont take kindly to you
pumping your own gas, i accidently did it when i first entered OR.No arrests
were made but i got a real dirty look. thanks

When in oregon    I open the gas door with the church key, and lock it
myself.  Those non vw experienced gs attendents twist it tightly the wrong
way etc.   They use the pumps, but I am protective, you know how people
aren't familiar with the way  the doors work etc.  easier to just do the bus
stuff myself, they can use the pumps if thats the law.

so, when in oregon with a barndoor, My advice would be to open the engine
lid, and make the guy stand there till the tank has been filled
appropriately, not walk away.     If you pick a favorite station living there
you could find a friendly attendent you eventually would train/trust to
operate the engine lid properly.

DO NOT under any circumstances walk away from your barndoor with the engine
lid open on the elbow stand, if you have one.  People just love to close the
engine lid by yanking the lid down, bending or breaking the barndoor only
engine lid elbow brace.
