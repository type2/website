Hello Charlie,

Always good to hear from you, good friend... Glad to hear that you got
your problem fixed quickly.

I don't carry a spare dizzy (I have one, but it is in a former
girlfriend's bus right now), but I do carry a spare set of points. 

For the benefit of the list, if you have to pull your dizzy out to put
in a new set of points, don't take the 10mm nut loose from the dizzy
clamp to get it out. Instead, undo the 13mm nut that holds the clamp ,
pull the dizzy and clamp out at the same time. After you have changed
the points and reinstalled the dizzy, it will be in the same place it
was before you pulled it out. It may still be necessary to adjust the
timing after that (timing will probably be a little advanced), but you
will be close enough to get the bus started, with no guesswork...

Happy Holidays, Charlie. Hope to see you soon!

david
