One little fact I
&gt; found out about the gear shift while I think about it.  A shifter from a 66
&gt; bus won't work in a 67 bus and I presume it's the same the other way around.
&gt; The spring is a tad shorter on the 66 shifter for one thing but the main
&gt; reason is that the piece that sticks down in the socket is shorter on a 66
&gt; than on a 67.
&gt; 

a 66 and 67 shifter is the same, as long as the bus came with the later style of front shift rod where the front shift bushing pokes into the front end of the shift rod and slides onto a peg sticking back at the front there.  The earlier kind the bit the shift stick bolts to has a circle that goes around the front part of the shift rod and the bushing goes in that circle around the shift rod.  this was changed early in the 66 model year, so an early 66 came with the one kind, and maybe the 66 you got the piec eoff was an early 66 and so had a differnt piece than the 67 .  I hope this makes sense, it is hard to describe clearly.  The early kind it really helps for reassembly to have someone under the bus holding the bit the shift stick bolts go into, the later kind you can assemble it w/o help easily.


&gt; Next I slid underneath the front of the bus.  Every ...
&gt; Last of all, I had my dear ol' mother sit in the bus and turn the wheel side
&gt; to side while I watched underneath.  This verified that all 4 ball joints
&gt; are shot, both ends of the drag link are worn out, but surprisingly, the
&gt; grease-caked center pin (swing arm) showed very little play.  It evidently
&gt; has been kept lubed.  It is more than coincidence that all non-zerk parts
&gt; are shot but the ones with zerks are still good?  You can bet I'll be
&gt; hunting for zerk equipped ball joints and if I can't get them, I'll drill,
&gt; tap, and zerk them myself.

well, as least tie rods and drag link aren't that hard to replace or expensive to buy.   Yup, I like the ones with grease fittings too, but I think only the sealed kind are now available.

sorry about the bad news, 


Clara
