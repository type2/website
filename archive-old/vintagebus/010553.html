Hi NQ,
This is something we have wondered about since coming across a VW that had 
solid copper washers on the sump plate studs.  Due to the slight pressure 
there they washers spread out and in to the point of locking themselfs onto 
the studs!  Our best guess would be to figure .010&quot; crush.  Would be really 
nice to get some measurements from some used copper sealing rings that have 
been used for 50,000 miles or more to see how much over time they crush.
