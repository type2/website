,
&gt; Glad to hear you made the trip in such good shape. I
&gt; talked to you about a
&gt; show we are planning in Angels Camp, Calif. on July
&gt; 28th and thought I'd
&gt; send the URL. Go to vwswaps_dot_com and the show section
&gt; has all of the
&gt; information. Hope to see you there and please send
&gt; your meeting times and
&gt; dates.

Hey Britt
I passed along your E-Mail address to Jim Becker who
puts on our local get togethers up here in the Reno
area. We will send along any local info as it comes
up.
Maybe we will bring down a caravan to your show in
July...
If anyone else on the List is interested in the Reno
VW Group, just let me know.

Chuck Notmeyer
Reno
