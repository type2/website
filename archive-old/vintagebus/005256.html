Subject: Looking for 66 bus parts to start project...
Date: Fri, 21 Aug 1998 22:18:34 -0500
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

I keep putting off the 66 bus project for one main reason. When I
resurrected Li'l Red, I spent a lot of time waiting for parts to arrive at
my door and my grandpa went without use of his shop for a good 4 to 5 months
because of this.  I can do better than that!  I've gathered some goodies for
my bus which include a new domelight control switch for the steering column
area, complete set of rubber, an engine, pcoated rims, etc.  But what is
hanging up are 2 major components and I going to take one last poll amongst
the aircooled listservs to see if anyone has what I'm looking for.

I'm going to convert the rear of the bus to IRS.  This bus is going to be my
go everywhere bus and I'm very comfortable with the IRS rear ends.  I'd like
to know if someone has the Wolfgang kit (including brackets, long IRS axles,
etc.) and decided they'd like to sell it.  I'm interested if you can make me
a deal.

The other item is that I'd like an adjustable front end.  I have the stock
1966 front end on this bus and there is no rust-thru that I can see.  If I
put the IRS rear on this bus, I must be able to control that front end so I
don't end up with a nose high attitude on the road.

The reason I really want to have this bus running by spring is that there is
a trip I *MUST* complete before my elderly grandparents pass away.  They are
getting up in there in years and although they are quite healthy, I just
feel that time is getting away from me and them - you never know what will
happen.
The gal who sold me the bus is good friends with my grandparents (from both
sides) and what I want to do is fix up this 66 (at least mechanically), load
up the family in it, and cruise on down (about 70 miles).  I think it would
be an absolute thrill to shuttle down one Sunday and show up at church with
a full load of realtives who haven't seen their old friends in years - and
in the process have the bus involved and give my grandparents their first
ride in a VW bus.  It's been in my mind since I got the bus but I've just
got to get this done.

I'm also on the lookout for a set of wiper blades for my bus as well.

Thanks for reading...
