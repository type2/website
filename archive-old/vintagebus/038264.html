For sale or trade, one super straight left rear corner from a '67; has
reverse light hole.  Panel runs 5&quot; through vent, 3&quot; above beltline, down
rear hatch seam and has support and &quot;battery&quot; tray inside.

$125 plus shipping from Houston, TX.  I would love to trade for something
for my late '55 23 window or accessory. 

Mike
