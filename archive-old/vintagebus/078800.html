Subject: Re: [VB] What to do with old lifters?

----- Original Message ----- 



&gt; I know you can make a lamp base with an old camshaft &amp; gear.
&gt;
&gt; So what are old lifters good for?
&gt; -- 

Re-grind and parkerize them and use them again! SLR does it for a very
reasonable price. Better than most aftermarket after that!
