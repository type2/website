Subject: Crashed my bus - Now need a new one _at_#$$&amp;%%^$%_at_

I was cruising down the road on Saturday in my &quot;new&quot;
72 Westy when this stupid teenager in his big old
Thunderbird pulls thru a stop sign and directly into
my path...WHAM!!! The Westy nailed him doing about 45
MPH!! The good news is that me, my wife, and my
stepson were all un-injured, HOWEVER, the bad news is
that the nose of the bus got CRUNCHED!!!! Probably not
fix-able :-(  So now I have to fight with this kid's
insurance company to try to get a fair settlement and
buy another bus.  Soooo, anybody got a decent bus for
sale near the Midwest or Southeast??  I'd prefer a
68-71 westy but will consider all.  Does NOT have to
have a running engine (I have 2) but I'd like it to be
otherwise road-worthy with a decent body.  I live near
Cincinnati, Ohio but will travel for the right deal.
Depending on the insurance settlement, I may have only
a few grand to spend. Sooooo, can anyone help out a
long-time bus brother?!?!?
PEACE! John Baker
