There's a junkyard in Rancho Cordova that specializes in high-end wrecks,
ie Porsche, BMW, Ferrari.  When Scott and I were junking a couple weeks ago,
there was a *beautiful* corvair in the new arrivals section.  I don't remeber
the name of the yard, but I could do some local legwork if you wanted, or 
maybe another Sacramento-area listmember remebers the name of the yard.  It's
2 yards down from the Pick-N-Pull Foreign yard.

&gt; friend drives a 64 or 65 corvair van(greenbriar i think) anyway his clutch
&gt; cable is on the way out...a little frayed....anyway these are NLA....I culdn't
&gt; beleive it, it is quite a complicated mess, the corvair parts supplier (i
&gt; guess there are basically only two, and one of the m is the main guy) only has
&gt; used ones....USED CLUTCH CABLES...for $200...i feel sorry for my friend so i
&gt; said i would post to the other aircools on the list on friday as it is kind of
&gt; off topic...but us aircooled need to stick together...any leads would be
&gt; appreciated...
