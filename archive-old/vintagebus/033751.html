    Not a very bussiteing vacation. In the little over 800 plus mile 4 day
San Diego holiday I only saw 1 split. It was an absolutely beautiful (from a
distance) 23 window deluxe, SWR and White in Torrey Pines$$$$ besides that I
have now named San Diego county the rear bumper less bay bus city, being
that of the 30 plus bays I saw almost all of them were missing the rear
bumpers, the years seemed to be mostly 68=71, then the vanagons outnumbered
the bays, so you San Diegians where's all the splits???
