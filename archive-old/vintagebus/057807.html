Subject: '67 brake line  position Q

Hi all,

I'm trying to finish installing a '67 brake system in my '65 after too 
many near misses with no brakes.  I went the route of getting a '67-only 
brake line kit.  I'm down to the last line- the front passenger side. 
 Its not routed anything like my '65.  Its alot shorter- 957mm.  I'm 
wondering where it runs to get to the 'T'.  I did some line art below. 
 (What I'm calling the 'bulkhead' is the piece that goes sidewas across 
the bottom of the bus right rearward of the M/C).   Does the '67 brake 
line cut across behind the 'bulkhead' and poke out through it closer to 
the master cylinder.

wheel cyl. end
