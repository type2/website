Hi Everyone,

	I just wanted to let you all know that I've re-organized my server space
and now have a new address for my Air-Cooled VW Tech Pages.  The new address
is:

www.nateswaterart_dot_com/vw/

	From there you can easily (hopefully) navigate through the series of topics
relating primarily to pre-'68 busses and air-cooled VWs in general.  Some
new additions include, an engine build/re-build parts list, custom side
scoop fabrication and installation, VDO Kienzle clock movement basic
testing, repair and adjustment as well as an air-cooled tech links page.
I've also got a few topics in the works right now, but as of yet, I have no
time as to when these will be ready and up (sorry).

	Please let me know if you have any problems navigating through anything or
it pics don't show up when asked.  Thanks.  I hope you all have a great
weekend!!
