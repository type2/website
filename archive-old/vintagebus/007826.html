My first AIRS call!...Went into work late so i could go over and help out
this fellow driver. He was tryin to get a new plug in #2  and the thread
wouldnt start. I tried it too, but no go. I asked for his old plug and
wouldnt ya know it had an insert still stuck on it - Insert blew out of the
head. Looks like he got the raw end of the deal on his trade...... Towed the
bug back over to my house via his honda and a tow strap, and he left it here
till he can come and get it.

20 megs for my trucks site in about 20 seconds....
