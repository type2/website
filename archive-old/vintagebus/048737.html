Subject: neat work shop heat...engine STILL going together.

The ranch house and property I reside at has a shop that was built 
the same time as the house. It's a real nice one that could hold up 
to 6 vw's if i really wanted it to. It's more of a 4 car with a 
little workspace, or a 2 car with a lot of workspace, or a one car 
with wasted space. Right now I've got the '59 Euro truck and the '59 
Kombi in there.

When the old folks built the place, they put an old antique cast iron 
wood burning stove complete with modern exhaust chimney in the shop 
for heat. I hadn't ever used it to date. It's a bit chilly here 
today, so I decided to give it a shot.

All i can say  is it's SOOOO COOOOL working in there with the 
crackling wood and the smell of west texas mesquite burning. Nice, 
cozy, cheap, &amp; cool.

bus stuff: I'm getting the engine tin pieces cleaned up and installed 
for the '75 1600cc DP that goes w/ my '59 Kombi. Considering this 
engine was running straight J-pipes and was missing a lot of engine 
tin, I'm sure it was running hot and hard. I'm doing my best to put 
everything back on and make it all good.

There is no thermostat on the engine. I'm gonna put it together 
without one right now. I'll consider addressing that in the future. I 
just don't want to mess with it at the moment. Don't really have the 
money or patience to chase down all the parts for it. It seems to be 
missing the brackets, ect. Odds are I'll end up pulling the engine 
for one reason or another in the not so far future and I'll try to 
get it done then. I'm just tapped right now.
