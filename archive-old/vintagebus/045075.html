OH yha Clara, tell them about your Gas Pedal! :)

I only make jabs because Clara is one of the most welcoming people I have

met.



And the real truth is that she KNOWS when something isn't stock -- I'm sure

I'm not the only one who doesn't even recognize when their bus has mods ...

when Steshen came down to Oly for to do his tranny swap which didn't happen as
I was still tangled up in the tranny swap on my 65westy, he looked on the
front floor of my westy and saw my pedal.  Yes, on the gas pedal is a
seventies style bare foot.    (Due to the weight of this i doubled springed
the carb- the spring between the upper and lower parts and also the older
style that has the 3 pieces that go between the fan housing and the round
thing at the back end of the gas cable) And to crown it off I have the
matchingbare foot for the high beam floor switch!!!!!   

These came with the bus, which had been altered by some seventies minded guy
who had the impression that painting the inside with brown paint with a brush
and a cruddy metallic blue sprayed on the inside made it look better.  I
disagree with the colours scheme, but I like the feet  :)
