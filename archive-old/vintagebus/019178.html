Subject: Speedo Whine
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

In my 65 daily driver I have been having a problem
with a &quot;whine&quot; coming from the speedo.  I have
replaced the cable with a new one and even switched
out speedo's.  Only to see marginal results.

Usually only occures in a.m. commute (i.e. COLD
weather).  Can last for 5 seconds, 5 minutes or even
15 minutes.  Speedo needle remains fairly constant
(maybe a 2-5 mph flucutation) during the &quot;whining&quot;.

Any ideas, do I need to/can I lube my speedo???

As always, thanks.

Enjoy your day!
