&gt; so...do something. Start a campaign in response. A petition to start 
&gt; with. Get on all the lists and the newsgroups and bullitin boards and 
&gt; have people go somewhere and enter their info. Have a form letter 
&gt; they can print out and send in. Use the word boycott and media. 
&gt; Create an organiztion and make letterhead. Threaten to write to shows 
&gt; who use VW advertising. Works for those lame groups that go after 
&gt; things like Howard Stern and South Park.
&gt; 
&gt; Complaining amongst each other only goes so far. If you wanna 
&gt; actually get through to them you gotta get organized and be 
&gt; pro-active. Threaten them where it counts...the wallet!!! Right now 
&gt; they count on people just going along with what happens whether they 
&gt; like it or not.
