Case in point:  the above.

This is the '50-'67 VW bus mailing list.  That means you can ask questions from
knowledgeable people (I'm not including myself in that group) about 1950 to
1967 VW busses.  There is already another list that caters to the other models.

There is nothing wrong with later model busses,  its just that with sooooo much
minutia concerning just the splits, to include 20 more years of bus models
would be just too confusing and frustrating for both camps.

Think about how long it takes on a regular dial up line to search through the
galleries now.  Just think of the time it would take if you included two more
generations of busses.

Look, sitting at the back of the bus (pun intended) is NOT good.  Certain
things need to be integrated (use your imagination! )  Bus lists and web sites
do not!  There is room for EVERYONE on the internet.  When someone has the
passion for bay window busses like Thom, Everett , or Wade do for the splits,
there will be a great site for the later model busses I'm sure.  The fact that
they (bus) are segregated in to helpful categories is not only useful but in my
opinion absolutely necessary.

In short, leave them out.
