For that  matter, the cabinetry of the Sundial looks very similar to a 
Westfalia, are  there obvious differences?


Hi Clark,
In our opinion the Westfalia interiors are much more solidly built and  
better designed.  Make sure to also check out SO-33 and the SO-34 &amp; 35  interiors.  
Alot of good literature _at_

Also try Thesamba_dot_com and run a search in the gallery section for &quot;SO-33,  
SO-34, SO-35&quot;.
 
We looked for about 4 years for our Flip-Seat SO-34  Westie.  Kept it in 
storage for ten years while we found most of the  missing parts and now are 
getting to do the body work to have back on the  road!
