hm- thinking a bit more, I'll bet you a donut you can't loosen the shoes with 
the adjusting star.  If  the drum wont even turn,    brake the axle nut 
loose,  (46mm socket, 3/4&quot; drive, probably need a 6ft cheater tube, and block 
the wheels) brake the lugs loose, jack up the bus and  take the rim off.   
Get  a good jack stand unde r the rear axle tube.  Bang the drum with a BFH 
on the outside ofthe circle.  THis tends to knock the rust loose.  I really 
hope no one pulled the ebrake 10 years ago.  Remove the big axle nut.  use a 
fat screwdriver or some implement and poke it through the lug holes or brake 
adjusting hole so it rests on the shoe.   NOT  the backing plate, the brake 
shoe.  Bang with the BFH, switch to the other side (other shoe)  This should 
get the drum off.   Only have one wheel off the ground when doing this.      

clean the axle spine and the drum where it goes on with a wire brush and use 
grease or anti seize on the spline before installing  so it is easy next time.
