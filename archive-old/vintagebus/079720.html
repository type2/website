Subject: appealing manly arrr! arrr! exhaust

Just thought I'd share since the list is migrating to that other web
based board :)  Since my stock muffler has bitten the dust w/ a
completely disconnected interior baffle I was looking at alternatives.
I lucked into a header &amp; bugpak QP at CYR a few weekends ago for $10.
Thought I'd give it a try. Tonite I finally got around to installing
it. It might be a bit rough looking, but man what a fantastic sound.
Very throaty thump-thump. I can already tell what a difference losing
some of the exhaust backpressure does. I'll have to mess with the jets
and settings again to get it right, but gonna definately gonna have to
give it the Tim Allen &quot;ARRR ARRR ARRRRRR&quot;. 

I assume I'll have to go up in jet sizes, but anyone have any good
pointers. The single 34pict-3 will only be on there a few weeks while
I'm waiting for my duals, so ordering a lot of $8 jets seems counter
productive at this point.
