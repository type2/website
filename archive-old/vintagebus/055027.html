the backup lights should still theoritically be on. Is this correct?  &gt;&gt;

Hi Scott,
Correct!  Just make sure to remove the green thin wire from the off the coil 
that goes to the points of the distributor.  This will prevent your points 
from getting burnt while you take several minutes futzing around with the 
ignition power on.

&lt;&lt; If it is then I can use the multimeter to figure out what's going on..... 
&gt;&gt;
That is the best tool for any electricl problem.  Eric&amp;Barb
