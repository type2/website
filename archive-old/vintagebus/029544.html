From beneath his floor-length hairdo, Cousin It respondez:

&gt; neat site but i believe that kevin (the man behind the curtain) was
&gt; blacklisted from the list a few years back due to some questionable business
&gt; pracitices..

Hoo yes - search the archives and you'll get the full picture.  

However, I want to add that one or two others (names not needed) have
had their sins paraded on the list and folks have eloquently begged
forgiveness for them.  I am *NOT* interested in raising this as a thread
nor in discussing it via p-mail (been there and done that), but consider
the fact that some folks get in a tight and behave badly, and some folks
grow and change.  More recent customers might have different opinions. 
(Could even be worse.)

That said, Kevin's site is great and he's a knowledgeable fellow.  I've
no financial connection.  Caveat surfer.
