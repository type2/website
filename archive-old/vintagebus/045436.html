I guess I might as well add mine to the list:

1961 Double cab with a 1915 and Empi 5-spoke knock-offs.
1966 Bug all original except for a Weingardt-built 1600.
1969 Bug pan (FS)
1970 Karman Ghia lowered and with the roof tacked back on.
1989 Vanagon that has been sitting for 3 years because I am too cheap to buy
heads.

I would like to mention that Kyle only mentioned his 2 1/2 Volkswagens.
Besides all the 'Vettes and stuff, the coolest vehicle he owns actually
belongs to his kid:  a John Deere Tricycle complete with Arizona Bus Club
sticker on it!!
