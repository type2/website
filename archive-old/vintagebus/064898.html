From: Stan Wilder &lt;wilden1_at_juno_dot_com&gt;
Subject: FS Type IV Forged Steel Counter Weighted Crankshaft.

For Sale:
Forged Steel Counter Weighted and Balanced Crankshaft for Type IV Air
Cooled Engine.
Crank is 10/10 and just came back from being polished and checked for
straightness at crank shop.
This crank comes with 4 notched and balanced rods.
I'll thrown in an unknown Weber Cam:  high lift cam with the lifters. The
cam still has the parkerizing on it.
Price $600.00
If you have an interest contact me.
In another two weeks it will be in an engine and running in my Westy if I
don't sell it.
I've collected all the parts and only need to tell the supplier to ship
the main bearings.
This is your chance to see a Type IV crank out 6500 Rpms and kick some
butt.
