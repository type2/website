I bought a '67 rear end to use as a core to be rebuilt- so I can continue to 
drive my bus. My bus is a late '63 and has the '64 style brake assembly the 
P.O. said(VIN # 1078083). Will it work to put in the complete rear end out 
of the '67 including brakes into my truck? I would like to have it rebuilt 
and have it powdercoated so that I will have little down time. My tranny is 
a big nut and I am hoping they are basically the same. TIA.
