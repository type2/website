Subject: Re: [VB] Full-Flow System Oil Pressure

Sounds strange to me. I've got the Berg filter, plus a four loop cooler in
the full flow Berg-fitted case running fine with no problems since install
in 1991. My line size is whatever Berg sold me - Teflon with stainless
steel webbed outers - I believe they are fairly small (1/4&quot;?). Maybe you
don't have enough oil in the system?

&gt; I'm using steel-core high-pressure hydraulic lines,
