Subject: [VB] Repo Tents - cost
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

since you can buy original Westy driveaway tents (later Westys) for $300-$500 
, I do not see that you can make them for that much less in good quality 
materials  and make a small profit for your troubles.

there are just too many poles along with the canvas.....the cost + investment 
would be high.........
