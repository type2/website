Subject: RE: [VB] Wireing HELP

Hey Ronnie,  I just received a correct pair of Hella big tops for my
firebus... and got the m working and all.  So cool and real load.  It
brought back memories for my wife that grew up in Italy.

The high/low neener neener sound is made by a timer mechanism that
switches between the two horns.  Give me a call if you want.


David


Ronnie asked:

  Does anybody have or know anyone that has the wireing diagram for a
relay box for emergancy lights. These are 12 
volt, with 2 lights and the hi/lo horns. Need to know what the numbers
mean on the control box
