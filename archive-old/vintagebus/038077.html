flex lines, yup.   

bad springs can also  let the brakes drag a bit, but flex lines will  ket the 
pressure out to the wheels, but when the are sweelling shut insiode, the 
pressure wont go back from  the wheel- drag/lock

&gt;  Just wanted to get some suggestions as to what I should look at on my 
&gt;  brakes.  Here is the situation.  When you press on the brake pedal it 
&gt;  becomes stiffer and stiffer to press.   Also the brakes at the wheel don't 
&gt;  release pressure after you have let up on the brake pedal.  This continues 
&gt;  for a few pedal pumps until the brakes are completely locked up.   Then 
when 
&gt; 
&gt;  you go to one of the wheel and open the bleeder port the brakes release.
