Subject: rust (oh, no!)

I have checked the archives, but would like some opinions/ideas from
listees. Passenger &amp; driver floor pans are badly rusted in '63 bus. I
can see the road through the floor and probably could easily put my foot
through. I know that replacing the sections is an option, but don't want
to spend that kind of money. Question: can I apply POR-15 and while
still wet put down fiberglass and then apply more POR-15? This is
something I can do rather than pay for parts, welding, etc. The whole
area will be covered by rubber mat and this is definitely not a show
car, but I want to protect what's there and make it safe. Opinions
please.
Bob, in northern Calif.
