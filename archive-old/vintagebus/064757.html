Subject: Re: [VB] Heat Exchangers

generally exhaust in the heat is from a rotted out muffler, which tends to be 
easier to swap than the exchangers.   One test you can do sniff the heat from 
the front, and compare to the back, as in your deluxe one heat exchanger 
feeds the back heat and the other the front.  (in commercials you have to tie 
one box open and the other leave closed, then change them to compare boxes). 
If one is clean and the other exhausty, you know one box is bad, the other 
good, and the muffler good.   Before installing a heat exchanger, check both 
ends for tiny cracks through the thick tube, especially where the muffler 
goes on.  You can also blow through the exhaust tube blocking off the other 
end to see if there are leaks.   

one time when removing a muffler from a bug with stinky heat, the muffler 
rattled around inside when I shook it, was very rotted inside!!!!!

You might want to see that all your heater tubes near the mufler are sealled 
well, and the exhaust donut area ditto..  I have had stinky heat before when 
the donuts leaked and it got sucked in somehow into a not sealed fresh air 
tube.   Having those fresh air tubes well sealed also helps cool you bus.

&lt;&lt; Howdy,
 
 After finding connecting heater tubes-from the 'heater mufflers' to the body
 tube, I was ready for warm air.  Well, I got it, but with an added bonus.
 Smelly, exhaust.  I am assuming that there must be exhaust leaks in the heat
 exchangers, therefore, they need to be replaced.  Any suggestions on the
 best ones to get and from where?  FYI:  The Bus has a '74 Beetle DP motor in
 it if that matters.
 
 Thanks a bunch,
