Subject: [VB] Engine lid hinges
Message-ID: &lt;19991114180518.13224.rocketmail_at_web604.mail.yahoo_dot_com&gt;

 While on the subject of engine lids... yesterday I
managed to completely twist two hinge pins in two.
They were apparently so rusted inside the bores they
just broke. Has anyone ever had to drill em out &amp;
install new pins &amp; if so, what did you use... Roll
pin, bolt, ect....
 Thanks,

 If you lend someone $20, and never see that person again; it
    was probably worth it.
