Hey Everyone,

    This whole hemp thing has really stirred up the list.  I'd like to add
to the fun.

    I'm prepared to offer up one of my spinning &quot;Vee Dub Emblem&quot; sprinklers
(a $60 value) as a prize to the first person who can correctly answer the
following Hemp trivia question:

&quot;In today's modern &quot;Zero Tolerance&quot; policy U.S. military, where in naval
shipboard aviation, is hemp used daily and why is it used there??&quot;

    First person to e-mail me the correct answer is the winner.  I'll post
the answer tomorrow evening _at_ 6:00pm PST if no one gets it as well as the
winner if someone does.

Good Luck!!
