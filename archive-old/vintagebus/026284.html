In Missouri (where Steve and I live), it's not a 'State' issue. These are local
ordinances governed by the City Board of Directors also known as Alderman.

If you can get by with that let me know. Missouri assess personal property tax
on vehicles, registered or not. If you can get them classified as yard orniments
you could probably avoid the yearly property tax too.
