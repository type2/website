Subject: Re: [VB] Intake Manifold Gaskets

Hi type2tom,
Bet there is a metal sealing ring in there!!  It is just  smashed in so much 
it now looks like part of the head.  Take a look at the  bore in the head, 
should be a &quot;L&quot; shape and not a shape that looks like a  negative of the beveled 
intake manifold end.  This O'ring  shaped seal is of steel with copper plating.
  Check out the &quot;Parts Manuals&quot; on the vintagebus_dot_com website.   With the 
part number you should be able to order the metal sealing ring or you  can order 
the full engine rebuild gasket/seal kit and have spare seals/gaskets  on hand 
for later.
Eric&amp;Barb
