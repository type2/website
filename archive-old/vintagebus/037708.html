Subject: Re: [VB] brakes!
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

you can take em apart in any order....what i do is i leave the other side for 
reference.....i was taught this by a master auto tchnician.....just remeber 
brakes are one of the simplest things, and one of the most important 
things..there is no need to be scared-watch which way and how the springs are 
hooked on etc do one side at a time and just keep cheking the otherside  from 
time to time
                             hope this helps,
                                   phil
