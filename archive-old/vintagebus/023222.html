	I just bought a rebuilt generator from Kragen for $39.95 + $15 core.
Thought I'de share the good deal.  If you call and ask it is listed as an
alternater.  I think the part number is 15270.  The only generator they
list is an $80 Bosch.  So if you want a good deal look for their $40
generator with a lifetime warrenty.  The one I bought was originaly made by
Bosch and rebuilt in some impoverished 3rd world country by barefoot
children.  But hay it only cost $40 and I never have to buy another one again.
