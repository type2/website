Subject: Tilt for sale

I have been trying to trade my Crew Cab tilt for a single cab tilt =
canvas for a while but haven't had any luck so I have decided to go =
ahead and sell it.  The tilt is a cab height bay window tilt but fits a =
splitty just fine.  The tilt is complete with the canvas and frames =
structure.  If I can get a reasonable price for it off the list I'll =
sell it here.  Not real sure exactly what is reasonable and/or what to =
ask for the tilt.  The repo canvas I need for an early tilt is _at_$700 and =
early hoops and bows go for $250 - $400 depending on how lucky you get.  =
Not sure how the prices transfer to the later models.  If you are =
interested Pmail me.

-Dan
