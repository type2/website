Hi all, this is the first time I have posted here.  But I have a 63 kombi and 
it should be out of the shop soon (I hope!!).  Any way, my questions is can 
someone please tell me how or where I can find out how the back of the back 
beach is to attach to the body.  Right now it just leans there.  I would hate 
to have someone riding back there and have it move.
Thanks,
Susan
