&gt; How does the pre-67 gas pedal differ from the

!!!!???

I've owned a 69 and a 75, worked heavily on a 72 and 73, and ridden/looked
at uncountable other baywindow buses..

Never has I seen arubber pad on the gas pedal.  I &gt;DO&lt; think that moms 82
vanagon has one.

I drive barefoot often in the summer time (and spring and winter and fall,
depending..) as well, and have never had a probelm with my foot slidding
on the pedal.  the pedal does not need .forward. force like most cars,
just down.  let gravity do most of the work once you get it where you
want it.
later...david
