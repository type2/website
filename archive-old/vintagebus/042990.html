Primers are porous, as Joe said. the way to go to hold off painting but
still protect the vehicle is to go to an auto body paint supply house and
pickup the three-part epoxy sealer (it's usually yellowish), and seal over
the primer. Your primer should be a zinc-rich zinc dichromate self-etching
primer, which protects the base metal and holds to it very well. When
sanding, it is a good idea not to go down below the zinc primer. Also, you
should do a final spray of the epoxy sealer when you are done blocking and
sanding, and then rub it down with that clear prepping liquid that pro
body shops use ( can't recall the name). *Then* you can topcoat.
