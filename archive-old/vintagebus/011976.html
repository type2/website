&gt;Here's the problem:  In the driveway, the engine sounds and runs great.
&gt;Idles smooth at 900 rpm, revs easily to 4000 rpm.  When I take it for a
&gt;test drive, it's VERY sluggish.  Feels like it can't get out of it's 
own
&gt;
Hi Mike, sorry I sent you mail addresed to your bus a minute ago, but 
maybe it liked the attention.
OK, so sputtering and trouble.
I am thinking it might be those carbs! 
If you want to try something else....


Are you getting fuel? Fuel pump giving enough? Test it. Fire 
warning!!!Be careful!!! 
Never underestimate rust in the gas tank and crap in the fuel pump.
Take off the fuel line past the pump. Put it in a jar. Turn the engine 
over without the coil attached. See how much fuel comes out, I don't 
recall off the top of my head how much fuel that is, but the VW manual 
will let you know how much, and I have always been able to visually tell 
what is good. If that checks, do something I have done but I might get 
flamed for. Put pressure on the line, like with a clamp or something to 
pinch it, how much now?

Ok that checks as good or bad. 
Now that you know there is fuel, I have to go back to saying it is the 
carbs.
Good luck.
Jason
