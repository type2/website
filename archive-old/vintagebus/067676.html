&gt; The tank does not seem too 
&gt; sit level; the forward edge sits on the &quot;shelf&quot; as
&gt; it should, but the rear 
&gt; rests on the &quot;bellhousing hump&quot; rather than flat on
&gt; the &quot;shelf&quot;. Is this a 
&gt; problem that others have found? What did you do
&gt; about it or what am I doing 
&gt; wrong? I've checked out Thom's writeup on
&gt; vintagebus_dot_com, but he makes no 
&gt; mention of having trouble getting the stupid thing
&gt; to sit level.

I have put the 68-71 in 3 of my buses, a 66 and 2
67's.
The only 'adjustment' I needed was to flatten the hump
on the middle rear edge of the tank with a block of
wood and a BFH.
The bay ledge is level, the split ledge has a hump.
After 'modifing' the tank, the fit was perfect. It is
a tight fit going in.
I cannot go over to Thom's site and answer mail using
Webtv but if I remember correctly, he does mention
having to flatten the hump on tank.
