Subject: Thanks for the welcome to the bus family

Thanks to all of those that sent me emails on the '62 bus. I know 
specific questions will come soon. I do have one about the headlights. I 
know there is a rubber piece that goes inside of the headlight housing, 
but is there one for the outside like is on the taillights? 
 
Also, If anyone is interested in a car show this weekend. The 
SouthEastern VW club is holding its first one in St. Augustine Florida 
on Sunday Nov 22nd from 9am till 3pm. Its located at the St. Johns Flea 
market on I-95 and SR 207. Its exit 94 I believe. Free admission and 
free registration. I hope to have my bus there, so if you see a gray and 
black '62 with only one headlight (for now)and no windshield wipers, 
that will be mine. 
 
If you dont know about the SEVWC and want info, email me and I can send 
you the address. 
 
David
