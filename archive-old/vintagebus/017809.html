I don't know how hot I am on the JB Weld idea. I've
used helicoils before, but only as a temporary
solution. Granted, it can be a fairly long-term
temporary solution, but temporary nonetheless. 

Heli-coil works like this - you tap and thread a
larger hole, and then screw in new threads. An insert
works basically the same way, but it's a more
permanent fix. For a truly permanent fix, though, you
need to replace the head. 

Good luck.
