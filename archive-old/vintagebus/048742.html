Subject: '59 Kombi 1600cc engine is in...

Just slapped my engine into the bus. I have finished the install yet. 
I still have to connect fuel line and electrical wires. I'm kinda 
bummed because last week I bought a brand new set of spark plugs and 
cables. Now I can't seem to find them. Anyone know where I left 'em? 
Went ahead and installed the engine anyway. I hope I don't end up 
buying more. Whatever.

I also ran into a problem I should have planned for. My bus had NO 
engine compartment seal at all. I could have ordered all new, but 
just didn't want to have to wait. So I scraped together some useable 
candidates from the couple of other dead busses I've got here. So 
that goes on my list with thermostat set-up for when I pull the 
engine. This is one more reason why the engine was probably running 
hot.

So I got a question. I'm gonna use an oil bath aircleaner on the is 
engine set-up. It HAD one of the little round baja chrome things on 
it before. The oilbath cleaner has the 1&quot; port for the pre-heater 
pipe. I don't really want to use that. Can I just click the flap to 
stay open and run like that? I've got a block-off for the 
&quot;stove-pipe&quot; that comes thru the tin as well. The &quot;stove-pipe&quot; is the 
later bigger 2&quot; size that you see on bugs or whatever. So the 2 
openings don't match anyway. What do you think?

This engine has different parts from different years of engines. So 
I'm just trying to get things setup as good as possible with what 
I've got.
