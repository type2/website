Subject: Re: [VB] downshifting vs. braking
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

Hi Thomas,
If one was to use downshifting constantly one would just be increasing the 
wear and tear on both the engine and tranny not only due to causing more RPM 
changes in the engine, but also by reversing the wear on the parts.  
Mechanical parts of these only are good for so many turns!  If one really 
wants to save wear on the brakes and even improve MPG one must learn to coast 
up to red lights when and were possible.
