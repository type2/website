You should only have one red light, to the left of
your speedo.

&gt; Hi List,
&gt; The double cab we looked at in Oklahoma Sat. is
&gt; supposed to be a 63 model. There are some
&gt; differences
&gt; in the dash from my 63 so I wanted to run it by yall
&gt; and see what ya think. My 63 has a red light on
&gt; either
&gt; side of the speedo for the e-flashers. The one we
&gt; looked at Sat. had only one to the left of the
&gt; speedo.
&gt; The chassis # in the engine compartment is 1063551.
&gt; Can anyone tell me if this is in fact a 63 model or
&gt; not? My #'s indicate that my crew cab is a 63 that
&gt; was
&gt; built in the fall of 62, but they're not even close
&gt; to
&gt; these #'s.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; 3DPete
