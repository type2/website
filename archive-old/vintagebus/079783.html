&gt; my engine finally runs!!!!

right on, DONT forget things like brakes when you get the engine
running well.

&gt;    i put the engine in, hooked everything up (except battery) and now i have some more questions.
&gt; 
&gt; 1.)  when i cranked the motor over, the battery got hot, is this normal? (go easy on me, im 16 and my 67 is my first vehicle)

I don't remember any of my batteries getting hot. I have a few thing
to check though. Is the battery connected correctly (cable that runs
to starter on + &amp; cable that connects to body -) Are the
generator/battery/starter all 12v? How old is the battery? One more
thing I can just pull out as a possibility, is you have the voltage
regulalator hooked up, right? Muir has a pretty decent simple section
for testing this stuff.
 
&gt; 2.) what could be causing the battery to get hot if it isnt normal?
&gt; 
&gt; 3.)  what wires hook up to the negative side of the ignition coil besides the distributor wire?

just the distributor. the + will get power from the ignition switch,
and feed anything additional on the engine (like fuel solenoid and
elec choke)
 
&gt; 4.) does anyone have an accelerator cable clip i could get?? i fabbed my own, but i dont know how long it will last.

the barrel nut? or something else
