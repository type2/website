&lt;&lt; Can someone please define &quot;NOS&quot; for me? &gt;&gt;
Hi Chuck &amp; Jan,
Should mean &quot;New Old Stock.&quot; which translates generally as made when that 
particular year and model of VW was being made.  Some think it means &quot;Narly 
Old $#_at_*.&quot;.  OEM means &quot;Original Equipment Manufacture&quot; meaning it is 
probably made far afterward or even today by the same manufacture that made 
the part originally for that particular year and model VW.  Eric&amp;Barb
