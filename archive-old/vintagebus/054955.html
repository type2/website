&gt; I took off the pump and as a test, I replaced it with a pump from a

&gt;With the second pump there is still no fuel coming out.
&gt;I'm stumped, any one got a suggestion???

If you put the tank hose on the wrong pump connection , you get no fuel.
Try putting the input fuel hose on the top pump connection.
