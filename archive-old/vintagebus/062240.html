&gt; On my rear hatch the striker plate has an angle piece with 2 small screws in 
&gt; it.  It does not come into contact with the latch.  Is there supposed to be 
&gt; a rubber stop there?

Hi Bart,
It should if it is a post-1963 model.

&gt; Also it is off about 1/4&quot;, meaning the right side is almost touching and has 
&gt; rubbed a little on the top.  What would be the best way to correct this?  
&gt; Should I open it up and just really pull it over?  It is really hard to 
&gt; close with the new rubber and I am thinking that is why its off, it used to 
&gt; be pretty straight with the old worn stuff, had a groove it went into.  If 
&gt; you pull on it before you close it, it lines up.

New rubber will have to seat/squish in.  So try pulling it over when closing 
and see if it stops needing to be pulled over in six months to a year.  If 
not, adjust the door.

&gt; One more question.  Being that my bus is has not been color sanded and I 
&gt; want to drive a little.  Should I wax it to protect the new paint?  or is 
&gt; it ok to drive as it, just need to keep it clean?

If you are trying to preserve the original paint then wax it.  Use only a wax 
with Carnuba in it.  Ones that use Silicon in them make a real mess when you 
want to repaint it!
