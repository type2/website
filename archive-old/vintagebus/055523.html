 What do I need to do to drop a 36 hp on to my 67 tranny?  Do I need a 6V
 starter?  New starter bushing?
 
 I'm not sure I'll have my new motor done by a certain time, so looking
 at the 36 as a back up temporarily.

It bolts right on.  lots of clearance for heater boxes.  Yes a 6V start is 
probably good, I dont think they made 36hp FWs w/12V teeth, but you can put a 
12V solenoid on it if your bus is 12V.  The thing is - if your bus is 12V you 
need to either convert the bus to 6V or get a small diameter 12V generator- 
they make them for porshes.

Might feel a tad underpowered with the 67 gearing.
