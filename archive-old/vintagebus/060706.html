&gt; How do the overiders and uprights fit on those bumpers?

The ones we dealt with were fine.  Just as originals the nut plate that the 
upright and bumper bracket bolt to has to be in its proper forward place.  
All too often volks with original bumpers have that gap due to being rear 
ended even slightly which bends this nut plate toward the rear causing a gap.

 Do you have to put that black &quot;stuff&quot; on them &gt; to cover up big gaps?
&gt; 
Not the one we dealt with!
