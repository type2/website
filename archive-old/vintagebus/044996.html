&lt;&lt;I grabbed one of the old slats off the westy roof rack last night to see if
I could find something at the local hardware &quot;superstore&quot; after work today.
Unfortunatly, I forgot to count how many slats I'm gonna need!

So...how may slats are on a westy roof rack. This is one of the ones that
covers about 1/3 of the roof. It looks just like the one that PIP repros
and has in their adverts.&gt;&gt;
