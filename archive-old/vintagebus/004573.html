&lt;&lt; I have heard that towing a bus which has a transmission but no engine is 
not good on the transmission.  Has anyone else heard of this?  Is it true and 
if so, how
 does one tow without causing damage? &gt;&gt;

&lt;&lt;Hi Chris,
Only by having the tranny in gear and/or without oil can you damage it while 
towing!   Eric&amp;Barb&gt;&gt;

Well Chris,
The answer to the second part of your question about towing goes like this. The bus (or any correctly aligned vehicle) wants to go straight naturally. When the tow vehicle turns, it pulls the front of the towed vehicle to the side. Very little side pressure is required to make the towed vehicle turn to follow. There are two cautions that  you need to be aware of. The braking distance will increase dramatically (DO NOT TAILGATE). The other is to try to avoid putting yourself in a position where you need to back up. Backing this rig will cause the towed vehicle to want to turn and the towing vehicle will not be able to (or want to) follow. Backing up could jamb up the works and your new tow rig will never be the same again.
