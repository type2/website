&lt;&lt; I'm rebuilding the headlamp assembly (getting down to details) and need to
 paint the inside of the part that's between the lamp and the lens that does
 the adjusting and have conflicting input as to what color it was in '57.
 Any ideas? &gt;&gt;
Hi John,
Seems Vw painted these a metalic silver up to about 1960 or early 61.  Then 
1961 on they used a light gray paint color.   Eric&amp;Barb
