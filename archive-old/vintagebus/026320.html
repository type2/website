Aaron: All i can tell you is that they are Atlas--15&quot;  can be had in
14&quot;  but all i carry is 15&quot;  these are the GOOD ones!! We did carry a
wider porta wall --but it did Not stay close to the sidewall--These
white walls stay so close to the side wall --you need to pull it away
with your finger nail!! Do not know about a Radial big white
wall--Actually Porta-walls do have a vintage history!! They have been
around for decades!! I have never had a problem with these for as long
as we have been seling them--But 135 size tires puts these porta=walls
Close to the ground--145 is no problem--Also if you do ruin one of
them--We do sell singles--We always have them in Pomona--Road 33 space
12--the VW bus section.
No matter who you buy them from--i recommend the Atlas brand----TWWM,
uncle jerry
