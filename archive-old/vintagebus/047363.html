&lt;&lt;A matter of balance.....still juggling that one myself :)
The Splitties are going to continue to appreciate, and much faster than
their later counterparts absolutely.
Keeping that in mind...it makes sense to protect your investment.  The
opportunity for you to recover your monies spent on it to keep it at top
condition will be recovered.  Otherwise, you end up on the bottom end of
the scale when and if it is sold.&gt;&gt;

Actually, the resale of the bus was never really an issue.  I have a tendency 
to bond with my vehicles.  I still miss the rusted out P.O.S. Chevy Blazer I 
had my junior year in college.  As for My Bay window, I have been driving it 
for almost six years now and have taken it everywhere, or shall I say it has 
taken me everywhere.  If I was rich and had the space I would probably keep 
every car I buy and take turns driving them all.  Call me a packrat, call me 
sentimental.  I still wince everytime I see my old 71 Super Beetle cruising 
down US1.  I loved that car (and the 62 engine I sold with it! Damn I could 
use that right now!)  Well, I have a new car to love and hopefully it will 
return all I put into it.  As far as monetary investment, it was the worst 
decision of my life to by the 66.  No, it goes beyond money.
