Hi there!

 I have a bunch of org windows but I accidentally erased your original 
message before I could read it.  I don't know which ones you need but I have 
a couple of popouts and a bunch of pain glass to I thing three or four of 
them just sitting in my garage. If these are what you are looking for, how 
much do you want to pay? they are orig.

I live in Vancouver, Canada.
