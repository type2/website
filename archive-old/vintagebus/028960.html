Subject: Re: [VB] Support your FLAPS (NOT) footnotes

1) You will always hear horror stories about a shop before you hear good
testimonials. That's why auto mechanics often rate down there with
lawyers and politicians in the ethical arena.

2) We can make more money working on your bus, rather than telling you
how to fix it. If you prefer to fix it yourself (and I prefer fixing my
own stuff), then let us sell you the parts and give you whatever advice
you need to do it (Is it right for someone to buy their parts from Bus
Depot, then call us up to ask how to install them?).

3) Please don't ask us for a step-by-step procedure over the phone. We
have books we would like to sell you if you want to learn how to do it
yourself. If you're not sure about what you're doing or want it done
quickly, let us do it.

3) I will be spending more time at the front counter and answering the
phone, so please feel free to call me!
