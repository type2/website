Someone figure this out before I go crazy......=)

HERE IS A RIDDLE  (CO)

There are three words in the English language that end in &quot;gry.&quot;
ONE is angry and the other is hungry.

EveryONE knows what the third ONE means and what it
stands for.  EveryONE uses them everyday, and if you
listened very carefully, I've given you the third word.

What is it? _______gry?
