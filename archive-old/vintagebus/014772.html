OK people here it is:
The code has been cracked!

Gleaned from all of the responses that I got, I have found the following:

Bug and Bus fresh-air heater boxes are the same from 1964 (actually mid 1963)
and 1967.  They appear to be a direct bolt-in for either vehicle.

1968 bugs use the same until a few years later, but in 1968 through, what was
it, 1970 or 1971, the bay windows had some that looked like the bug's at first
glance - except that the linkages were on the opposite side.  In fact, someone
(names held as always) wrote and mentioned that JC Whitney sold a kit that
fascilitated putting the linkage on the other side if you have a bay with an
upright - or the other way around, that is, if you have bay heater boxes and
wanted to put them in a split.  Don't quote me on that visa versa thing,
though.

You're on your own on the stale air stuff, and REALLY on your own on the
barndoor stuff!

Thanks, everyone!
