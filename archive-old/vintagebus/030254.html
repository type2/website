&gt; I have seen this exact thing as well. REALLY turns you off. I don't
&gt; know who they think they are kidding.

We had a garage sale on Sat.  This guy walks up to me as I'm sitting in the
bed of my DC and says &quot;hey want to sell that octopus truck?&quot;  &quot;What&quot;? I
said.  &quot;You know, that octopus truck you're sittin on&quot;.  &quot;Uh...you mean this
VW crew cab?&quot;  &quot;No, you know, they are called octopus trucks....everyone
calls them that&quot;.  At  that point it was obvious this ding dong was
convinced that because Pick a Part here in Southern Ca used one in their
logo with an octopus (their mascot) sitting in the back, that they were all
called octopus trucks.  Go figure.   I gave up trying to educate him and
then sold him a cat carrier for 10 bucks.  He left happy as a pig in sh!t,
convinced he was right.
