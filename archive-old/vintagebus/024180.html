Subject: front wheel seals??? do I require them?
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

hey all ,

please tell me if my 1960 single cab reguires the front wheel seals when I 
change the wheel bearings ? they where sold to me in a kit with the wheel 
bearings . where do they go ? I dont remember taking them off the truck when 
it was stripped down to the spindle.  nor do I remember installing them on my 
58 last winter when the front bearings were redone.

thanks john
