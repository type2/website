Subject: 65 deluxe.  Engine Power Loss

Pulled the deluxe out today to drive so i can make
sure it can get to OCTO tomorrow.  It has a new 1600cc
engine (100% stock, new case, all the tin etc.) that
has 1500 miles on it.  My bus is basically a garage
queen so it does not get out often.

Anyway.  I had idling problems a month ago that i
tracked down to a loose choke element.  This morning
it idled fine and drove fine until i tried to get up
to speed.  Nothing.  No Power. I mean nothing.  I also
noticed that it seamed to be really hot.  I drove
about 1 mile after letting it warm up and had to turn
around.  I am pretty sure it is not the clutch as i
know what that one feels like.

Any ideas where to start?  I have oil.  (does not
leak)  Nothing out of the ordinary in the engine bay
except hot air.

I am sure it will make it to OCTO (About a mile away)
but something seams wrong.

thanks for the help.
Matthew
