Subject: Stock tire size

I have been looking for tires for my 65 deluxe.  I have been thru the
archives and have not found what i was looking for so i ask:

I seams to me like 185/70 R14 was the closest thing to the original 7.00
R14.  Given that, what tires have you all found (brand etc.) that have
looked correct/good on a all stock bus?  I do not what to go with
bias-ply and do not want white walls.

Any input out there?

Thanks
