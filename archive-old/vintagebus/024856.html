Paul,

I have heard you can use a super beetle windshield motor because it is
smaller than a conventional 12 volt motor.

In a few weeks, I will be cutting up a derelict bus I found. Havent
dicerned whether it is 6 or 12 volts yet, if you can wait that long. It
looks to be about a 1964. Just took one quick look one day.

Les
