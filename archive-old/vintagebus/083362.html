Subject: Re: [T2] deck height

There is SO much more to a combution chambers resistance to detonate than
compression ratio. I can run my 12.2:1 race motor on 91 pump gas without
detonating (It just runs really hot!) with the help of the tight deck height
(.043&quot;), having smoothed all the edges in the chamber to avoid hot spots,
and having a cam with enough overlap to allow it.

My boss has a street motor running 13.5:1 on pump gas and it runs cool as a
cucumber. He is running a custom piston design with a combustion chamber
design to work with it that really makes an efficient burn. More energy
toward power than heat than with a normal flat-top piston design.

It is never as simple as &quot;more compression makes you run hotter&quot;. Too low of
compression will make you run hotter in a lot of cases too. Match the
compression to the rest of the motor combo.

&gt; Eric,
&gt;
&gt; thanks for your input.  However, it seems like an incomplete response.
&gt; Keeping with the educational mission of the list it would help if you said
&gt; &quot;why&quot; or &quot;why not&quot;.  Somebody was talking about the &quot;quench&quot; area a few
&gt; weeks ago.  What is ideal?  Please share your understanding!!

&gt; &gt;&gt; If you run a higher CR with the fuel we have today, you will have
&gt; &gt;&gt; overheating problems.
&gt;
&gt; &gt;No offense, but that's so far from fact that it isn't even funny. Just to
&gt; be
&gt; &gt;honest.
