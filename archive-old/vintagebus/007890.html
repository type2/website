&gt;Hope there is enough bus content in there to keep Everett and Thom from
making too many interesting comments about my request :)
&gt;
Wow, what a slam, I thought you were my friend. &lt;sniff&gt; &lt;sniff&gt; ;)

Anyway, guess I better make a smart-ass comment, how about:

&quot;Real Buses aren't 12v!&quot;
or
&quot;Installing the sticker won't make your red light go off.&quot;

If someone has a scan of the Bosch sticker for a &quot;round&quot; regulator (54-55
only?), I'd like to have that.
