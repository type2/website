Subject: Re: '64+up rear-end on a '63-down bus


&gt;---&gt; What if your brake system fails in any way that causes the fluid to
&gt;exit.  On a 1966 and earlir bus, you lost all braking...
&gt;&lt;--- Next step is to use the mechanical cable we all call the &quot;e-brake&quot; or
&gt;&quot;parking (rust in place) brake&quot;...
&gt;
&gt;So, do I expect that in such situations I should worry about doing a 180?

What, are you serious? Your ebrake isn't worth a fat damn at speed, try it,
but if it were the only thing braking it would pull itself to the rear
while the front forges ahead. Mr. Veewee opined about cars that had not
enough weight in the rear and too much braking in the front which makes
them jump around. I do not know why Brother Nader is conspicuously silent
about this. Maybe he is getting too old for battle. 8)
