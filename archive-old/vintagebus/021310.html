Hi Wes,
Probably!  There should be a boden tube slipped onto the end of the clutch 
cable body tube and slipped through that hole in the cast arm on the left 
tranny side plate.  There has to be a certain amount of sag in the boden tube 
or you need to install washers on the rear end of this tube before installing 
it's rear end in the cast arm on the left tranny side plate   Sounds like you 
need to get the Bentley reprint of the VW 1963-67 bus shop manual to go with 
the Idiot's manual.   Eric&amp;Barb
