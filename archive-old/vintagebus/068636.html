Subject: Re: [VB] engine

I took a trip up to Jake Raby's place a while back and he claims that a SP and DP are the same thing
except for the split manifold at the head.

He says that if the tube going from the carb is the same diameter, why should the split manifold on
a DP make any difference in the amount of air/gas delivered to the heads?

He said the DP heads are just a gimmick and that they aren't worth installing because they crack
easier.

Just more *fuel* for the fire.

OK, Ya got me stumped on yer thinkin here. Identical stroke and bore with more
air and fuel equals less torque? Couldn't prove that to me and my 67 SC. I
pulled the new SP out because I needed the pulling power with a load up the
hills. And with the larger oil cooler and wider fan, cooling shouldn't ever be
a problem in normal applications.

Hi John,
SP will deliever more torque, while DP will result in more HP at much higher
RPMs.  For a bus the SP and its resulting increased torque over DP is
absolutely needed.  At least this seems to be the rule of thumb for engines
up to at least 1776cc size.  For even more torque go with more stroke of the
crankshaft and less bore.
