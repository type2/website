No, it's not me, my friend Jason is driving his 65 hardtop deluxe to New 
Mexico. Taking 101 through California.  He left Saturday, and called 
yesterday from Laytonville where a spark plug had blown out of the head, ANy 
bus folks around there on the list?    Of course everything is closed Easter 
Sunday, but he was going to try a thread chaser for the head and if that 
didn't work get the helicoil thang done. 
  
He'll be heading south through SF and SJ and down the central Valley and east 
through Bakersfield.  If you see a metallic blue splitty w/ WA plates wave.

Clara
