Download a wiring diagram and see which circuits are common between the two
switches, and use those wires, and disconnect the others.

&gt;Hey guys----
&gt;I've got a 59' panel. I have a nice later style (66?) turn signal switch
that 
&gt;controls the high beams on it. I am wondering if i can use this switch on
the 
&gt;59' for the turn signals while keeping the foot operated high beams? Which 
&gt;wires would I have to disengage or not use from the switch?
&gt;I appreciate any help?
