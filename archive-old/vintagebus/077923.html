Subject: RE: classic plates

&gt;    I was just informed through motor vehicles that VW's ARE NOT considered
&gt;classic cars. Motor vehicles bases there information on what is supplied to
&gt;them by CCCA (classic car club of america) I went down their list of
&gt;CLASSIC's and nowhere was VW to be found!!!!!!, but our motor vehicles does
&gt;consider them HISTORIC.
&gt;    It would be cool maybe if we did a survey on each state's classic plate
&gt;requirements to see what other states think and/or use as their guideline
&gt;for classic car plates
&gt;------------------------------
  In florida we now have 'anitique' plates. ($25 to purchase and register 
for the first year,
good!). We used to have 'collectible' plates (25 years or older) and Street 
Rod
(special interest of some sort, becase i know someone running a kit car 32 
ford that
has this tag and its registered as a 99!).  Theres also 'horseless carriage' 
(pre war cars
i think?). Id be real susprised if a state limited it by make.
What killed our 'collectible' plate was that is was 20 years or older, so it 
started
showing up (automaticaly, not by requst) on 1980 fairmonts, workvans, etc. 
yuck,
who wants tht on their classic. I think the new antique one is 1975 and down 
which
is ok. You can also get the year of manufacture plates registered here, ive 
had
a couple of those.
jasonw
p.s. i got all my eggs in order i to fix my gas tank and engine mountings 
studs.
I ordered a new stock tank from busdepot and some other tidbits, got the 
studs
from a local vw guy and think i have the proper helicoils. i cant wait to 
have a
fuel gauge and a better than 50 mile per fuel filter run!
