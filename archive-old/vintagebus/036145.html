&lt;&lt; On the bad side, my blinkers are really confused.  Everything works as it

Hi Dworkin,
Definitely sounds like a bad ground to the right tail light.  Either you need 
to solder ground wires to the tail light bulb holders if they are pressed 
steel or drill and nut/bolt the ground wires to them if they are the cast 
bulb holders.  then connec the other end of these ground wires under the 
ground cable from the battery where it connects to the body.  Eric&amp;Barb
