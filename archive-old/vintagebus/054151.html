Subject: Good primer

I am doing body repair to my daily driver. I am able to work on small 
sections at a time. I have repaired quite a lot but those 
repaired/primered sections have started to rust after only one time 
in the rain. I used a phosphoric acid solution then a standard 
autobody rattlecan primer. I have read in the archives that zinc 
primer is the way to go. Those archive posts are from a few years 
ago. Is zinc still the standard bearer or is there a new and better 
solution?

Thanks,

Rocky
