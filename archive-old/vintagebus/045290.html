Hi all

I have a bit of a problem with my 59 panel. When I put my foot on the brake 
pedal the brake lights come on but one is very dim (bad earth I thought). 
When the park lights are on the one that goes dim goes compleatly out when 
the brake pedal is depressed. I'm running 6v and have cleaned all of the 
conections.

sounds like a bad ground.

this was going on in my 61 (12V) when I first pulled it out of storage in the 
spring.   I cleaned all the connections and grounds back there and it worked 
right.
