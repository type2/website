Subject: Velvet Green.

While driving home from Costco in Puyallup this afternoon.
I was going west on 112th St. a very straight velvet green Orig paint 
double cab was going east. First time seeing a double cab in this 
part of town, Could be a listee? although there are several splitties in the 
South sound.
