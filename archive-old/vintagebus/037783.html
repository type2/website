Howdy all. This is a bit strange, but bear with me.
A friend of mine is moving to Boulder, Colorado in a few weeks (late July) from
here, which is Raleigh, NC. I'm driving the U-haul out there with him, will
hang out for a while, and need a way back. I'd really like to find a
convertible Ghia, Beetle, or Thing, but a splitty or other bus would work, and
really I will consider any air-cooled VW as a cheap means to get back. I can
take an engine out there with me, so engine-less, or needing mechanical work is
ok. Anything out in the Colorado, New Mexico area, or within a hundred miles or
so of the route from NC. to Co. A good body would be great, but pretty much
I'll consider any leads. Obviously, the cheaper, the better.
Anyway, I know it's a long shot, but I appreciate any leads. I really do NOT
want to ride the Greyhound back, and I know plenty of folks around here looking
for busses and VW's in general.
:)
Thanks.
