This is unsafe, stupid and makes me question CE's responsibility as a
vendor if its true.

Go down to your local glass shop and tell them you need a tempered
windshield, try not to turn red when they laugh hysterically and say no
way in hell.

The reason tempered glass is not used for windshields anymore is that it
is too brittle. If a big pebble hits a laminated windshield _at_ 55mph, you
probably get a big star shaped chip with some spiderwebbing. If the same
pebbble hits a tempered windshield at that speed, you are likely to get a
faceful of glass cubes.  Sure tempered are a little tougher, and may not
shatter everytime,  but if you exceed their breaking point just once its a
faceful of glass for you (can you say eye damage and plastic surgery?) 

I like my eyes &amp; face and dislike blood too much to risk a tempered
windshield, I would hope most of you do as well. Though, you may all be
better at ducking or throwing your hands up in front of your face at
unexpected events...

take care,

Steve

P.S. If your bus rides around on a trailer and is never driven over 5
MPH or so to and from the parade ring, go for it, no danger there. Or if
it never leaves the garage of course.
