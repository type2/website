&lt;&lt;  I was reading in the archive that if the play is between the bearing and 
the case, reshimming is not necessarily a good idea. How does one determine 
where the play is occuring? &gt;&gt;
Hi Matt,
Two ways.
1. Remove the flywheel, seal, and shims.  Push #1 bearing rearward, and then 
push or have pushed the crank pulley forward while keeping a hand on the 
bearing and engine case at the same time to feel any movment of the bearing.  
This is done better and more accurately with a dial indicator especially when 
there is only a small amount of movement.

2. Install new shims to take up endplay and without seal install the FW and 
metal/paper FW gasket.  Tighten the gland bolt little by little and check the 
FW to make sure that it does not start to lock up . If it does lock up the 
endplay or at least part of it was between the #1 bearing and case.
