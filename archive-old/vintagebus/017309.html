&gt; So I'm thinking that it would be good to spend my birthday (today) going to
&gt; town and ordering the paint for our bus(+1) and getting a sandblaster.  (The
&gt; $100 sandblaster would be good to have...I'd use it on tougher areas as
&gt; paint removal, and the bumpers I'd also use it on would cost $25 each to
&gt; dip.....).  Please let me know if I should definitely not use it for
&gt; paint/rust removal on panels...?

The $100 sandblaster sucks.  I have one.  I had to modify it to get it
to work well.  The mods put me over the cost of the $350 blaster.  Unless
you have one kick-ass compressor, you won't get enuf velocity to warp panels.
I use Australian garnet, #80, which seems to work well for rust removal.

&gt; How much paint should I get?  I have no problem getting extra of the L87
&gt; Pearl White, as I'll need enough for two buses anyway, but I don't know how
&gt; to figure the amount of Sea Blue that I'll need for the under-the-beltline
&gt; exterior only on our '66.  I'm using Nason single-stage catalyzed urethane,

Depends on a lot of things.  The pigment makeup of the paint, the color the
bus is now (ie how hard it is to hide), how good of a painter are you, etc.

I used about 3 gallons RTS (ready to spray) on the '55, and about 4 gallons
RTS on the '60.  RTS is after you have the reducer, catalyst and hardener
in the mix.  Remember that this is doing the entire bus, engine compartment,
cab, etc. with enough paint to be able to color sand later.  If you go basecoat/
clearcoat you have that much more to contend with.

COnsult with the paint shop guy on this.
