Subject: Re: [T2] Starting Problems

Tommy,

Hmmmm...So how certain are you that the distributor drive is in the right 
place in relationship to the #1 at TDC(on the combustion stroke)??


Spark should always be verified at the spark plug end.
The results of that test tell you whether the condesor is working or not.

A thimble full of gas(or two) poured straight down the throat of the carb 
and then try to start it with the throttle held wide open will tell you more as 
well.  (NOT good if it backfires thru the carb tho)

My bet is that all of the issues are timing or distribution ofthe spark.

Leave the valves alone for right now.


Pop valve cover for #1/2 cylinder off and have someone rotate the engine
while you watch the valves move to find top dead center for #1 combustion 
firing.  Pop the dist cover off and see if you are in the right place(for 
#1 spark plug).

Always fix electrical/ignition before working on gas(carb).
If carb was on a running engine, then leave it alone till you get yours to 
at least fire up and get your timing/ignition right.

Can't remember if that carb has a solenoid cut off valve on it or 
not.  If it does, then it needs to work.

Report back.&lt;grin&gt;

Cheers, dave

&gt; Volks,

&gt; I'm writing this half for me (the &quot;talking through a problem you figure it out yourself&quot;) 
and half to try to find a solution.
&gt; 
&gt; I've been trying to get my newly built engine to start and having some problems.  
It turns over and almost starts but fails to catch.  
Engine: 1600SP, H30/31 carb, vacuum advance dizzy.  
Carb and dizzy came off the engine that was in this bus previously and that was running.  
&gt; 
&gt; I know that all starting issues come down to two things &quot;Fuel&quot; and &quot;Spark&quot;.
&gt; 
&gt; Spark:
&gt; 
&gt; 1) have spark at the coil (blue-ish spark)
&gt; 2) engine is almost catching: tells me some of the cylinders are getting a spark
&gt; 3) plug wires are new and in the correct order (checked and triple checked)
&gt; 4) points are set to 0.016&quot;
&gt; 5) static timed to 7.5 BTDC
&gt; 6) cap and rotor look ok
 
 Spark unknowns:
 
 1) condenser (assumed ok)
 2) should probably verify spark surface of the points
 3) Valves set too loose?
 
 
I'm getting to the end of my &quot;things to check and re-check&quot; here.  
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks,
&gt;     Tom
