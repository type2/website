What I hate is when people think that I'm into the Dead and smoking dope
because I've got a Bus. I don't like them and I don't smoke.  I've got a
shaved head for pete's sake. Besides, I don't think there would be much of
a mosh pit at a Dead show :)

I spend half of my time explaining to people why I'm a skinhead 
And the other half beating those that disagree.
 
Just kidding
