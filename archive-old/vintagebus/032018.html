In a message dated 98-10-20 16:26:03 EDT, you write:

&lt;&lt; I've got a '66 that's gonna be parted out. Can I use a cut-off wheel to cut
 metal sections off the body. I'd like to try &amp; keep just about anything
 that isn't crushed or rusted out. I don't have access to a torch, so that's
 not an option. TIA &gt;&gt;
Hi Rex,
Yes you can use a cut-off blade in a circular saw and/or a hacksaw, and
chisels.  Just watch out for the circular saw if it kicks back that you have
portions of your body out of the way it will go, or enjoy the trip to the
emergency room.   Eric &amp; Barb
