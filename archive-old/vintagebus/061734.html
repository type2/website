Subject: og front floor mat color?

Cleaned up my front floor mat today on the 65, and it is still brown!
Part #vw 211 863 711E, I thought all the dirt and debris would come off
and it would be black under there, but it is still a light brown color
after all the scrubbing.  What's going on here?  It is a walkthrough,
and the mat between seat stands is a nice color black after cleaning
