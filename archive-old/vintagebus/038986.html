&gt;     I have been considering installing an alternator in my daily driver
&gt; 64 westy.I like the idea of 70 amps of &quot;juice&quot;.But one of my concerns
&gt; is,if in a pinch(if my memory serves me)you cannot push start a car with
&gt; an alternator.I seem to remember that alternators need juice to produce
&gt; juice,where gen. do not ?

True, but push-starting is not a problem (maybe that's &quot;automatic&quot;
you're thinking of :-) )

An alternator does need to have a battery in the circuit, both to excite
the field coil and to limit the voltage it produces, but it doesn't take
very much current to excite the field.  I've push-started alternator-
equipped VWs many times, even with weak batteries.  You need a little
battery juice to work the ignition, as well, since the generator
won't produce enough for that at starting RPMs either.

Timely question considering my '67 Kombi has both an alternator
and weakening 2-year-old(!) &quot;Poop Boys&quot;-brand crappy battery.
