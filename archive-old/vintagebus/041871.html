&gt; Found where the class is held and that sucks because I'm looking for the
&gt; hotel.  Once again, Mapquest has street #s all messed up.  Finally find
&gt; the hotel, check in and off to sleepyland after a 10 hour run.  Monday
&gt; after class call Andy to say Hi I'm in town, let's hook up.  Andy's on
&gt; the AIRS list but he's changed his listing so no phone # and me without
&gt; internet access.  Look him up in the phone book.  Senior Jose says 'Andy


No phone # huh. Surprise to me. Im mailing wade to get him to put it back
on. When I asked him to make my listing first name only I guess he pulled
my phone # too?????
