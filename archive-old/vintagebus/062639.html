Subject: crooked door and missing stop? also wax question

On my rear hatch the striker plate has an angle piece with 2 small screws in 
it.  It does not come into contact with the latch.  Is there supposed to be 
a rubber stop there?

Also it is off about 1/4&quot;, meaning the right side is almost touching and has 
rubbed a little on the top.  What would be the best way to correct this?  
Should I open it up and just really pull it over?  It is really hard to 
close with the new rubber and I am thinking that is why its off, it used to 
be pretty straight with the old worn stuff, had a groove it went into.  If 
you pull on it before you close it, it lines up.

One more question.  Being that my bus is has not been color sanded and I 
want to drive a little.  Should I wax it to protect the new paint?  or is it 
ok to drive as it, just need to keep it clean?

Thanks,

Bart Daugherty
