&lt;&lt; OK, now that Zorm (my 58 single cab) accelerates like my 914 :-), my 
passengers are complaining about nothing to hold on to.  I don't have any 
door pulls, no dash grab handle, nothin.    &gt;&gt;
Hi Mike,
For your 58 you might want to keep an eye out for one of the vintage 
aftermarket passenger pacifier grab handle that was availible in the late 
1950s.
