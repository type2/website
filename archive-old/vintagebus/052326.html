Subject: RE: [VB] Back by popular demand - Alan Schofield repair panels

Well, I wish someone would let me know the status of the Michigan stuff, and
when its going to become avalible, since i probably  use the most of the
stuff on this coast. I wouldn't mind handling( jobbering) good parts that
fit with out have to rework the chit out of them, and paying thru the nose
for them. So if some one connected to the deal would like to get in touch
feel free to do so,,later
