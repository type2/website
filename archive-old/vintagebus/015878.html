I am trying to find out some of my buses history (see earlier message - previous owners) and it was suggested by C Dreike that if I give you all some more info of it someone may recognise it, its a long shot but here goes.Its a 1967 21 window deluxe, originally titian red with light grey top half, but has had the lower half painted blue at some point before 1991. It has been owned for a time by a woman at Valle Vista Oakland California 94609 &amp; 94601. Its licence plate number was 791AMC. It is fairly beat up with dents and scratches all over it ( a big dent was in the nose). It had a badly ripped gey rag top. Some time in the nineties it was imported to Belgian were it stayed until I bought it and got it to the UK. When I got it it had big radial white wall tyres. The only other thing that might help is that it has a sticker in the back window from Wolfsburg West with there La Habra address ( I dont know how long they have been in Anaheim)
Thats about it, any details will be gatefully received. Thanks Ady
