Subject: Re: [VB] Tire size question

Damn boy...leave those 'new' 14&quot; rims for you 'new' bus guys...hehe

Anyways.....On my 63 I run 215/75/15's (rear) with no probs whatsoever.  Another SV2's friend of mine runs 215's on his 59 DD panel.  He says it's tight getting them on, but once on, no issues whatsoever.  

If you're getting those 205's for cheap or free, they will do the trick.  I run 205's on all my buses with the exception of this one, 205's front and 215's on the back.

&gt; Someone mentioned that 205/70r14's are the closest to stock size.
&gt; 
&gt; In my Bently, it states a 25.8&quot; diameter tire is stock, while a 205/70r14 is
&gt; only 25.3&quot;.
&gt; A 195/75r14 measures 25.5&quot; diameter, which is closer to stock.
&gt; 
&gt; If you can find them, 185sr14's (80-81 aspect ratio) are the same diameter
&gt; as stock, but I would run either the 195/75 or the 205/70's
