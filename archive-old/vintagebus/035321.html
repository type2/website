Subject: HF sand blaster
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com, type2_at_type2_dot_com

I saw an ad with harbor freights $129 sand blaster on sale for $89 and was 
wondering if any one on the list(s) had used them and what they thought about 
them. haven't had much luck in the past with HF air tools in the past.
thanks
ronnie
