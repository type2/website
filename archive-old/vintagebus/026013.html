That's what happens when you buy Bose...and why they don't make commercially
available systems anymore. Too many DYI's that have no idea how to install a
system in a car.

Now, with a little knowledge of audio systems(not home audio either) you can make
just about anything sound good with a sound install, some tweaking techniques and
quality components...not a repaired 4&quot; dash speaker.

&gt;  I still don't see why it's so hard to go to Radio Shack and buy a $6
&gt;  speaker and call it good.  I guess for some people that would double the
&gt;  investment in their buses, but at least you'd have some cool toons while
&gt;  waiting for your friend with a f*rd pickup and 50 feet of rope to pull you
&gt;  home...

&gt; If you want to really go whole hog buy a Bose.  Makes the old speakers sound
&gt; like people with nasal problems singing into a tin can.
