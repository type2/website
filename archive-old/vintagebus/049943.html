All you need to do is grind out the VIN in the engine compartment, fill the
spot with bondo, use number stamps to make inpressions in the bondo while
it's hardening, and paint it over.  Install your 'novelty' ID plates, and
your stolen PU is ready to sell with suitably doctored papers, freshly
printed on your hi-res ink jet printer.
