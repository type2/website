Greetings Volks
Ran across a neat little site that goes nicely with our mindsets 
http://www.hiddenamerica_dot_com/
gives listings of those out of the way places and events to sidetrack to.
Why without it I would never have known about the moose dropping toss
or the garlic festival that those of us in the west could attend
