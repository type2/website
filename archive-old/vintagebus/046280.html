&gt;  Well, I havent been sandblasting mine. Instead, I have been using a hand
&gt;  grinder to remover the scale and then brush painting with a white primer
&gt;  with a high zinc content. Don't know if this is the best way to go about
&gt;  it, but so far I am content to do it though it is a formidable task. And
&gt;  t


a number of years ago when myself and my then boyfriend Mike pulled a 66 
westy from a junkyard and got it back on the road, the whole camper kit was 
pulled out.  Pulled a ton of soggy newspaper off the cargo floor under the 
plywood.   I proceeded to spend ages with a wire wheel and grinder getting 
the scale etc off.   I forget what exactly I put over the residual metal, 
then primer then paint, but it was not enough.  That bus changed hands a few 
times and is the bus Gene Cornelius had put so much energy into making pretty 
(as seen at Red Barn).  When he pulled up the plywood the floor needed doing 
again.    It was really neat looking at that bus and seeing what lasted and 
what did not.  Be aware that during the 5 or so years it had been either in 
the PNW or in north of SF coastal California, which are fairly damp 
locations.  The roofing tar between the tops of the doors and the door itself 
really did work.  Maybe I should have painted roofing tar on the cargo floor. 
 That would have been a pain to clean off, huh?
