&gt; Hi,
&gt; 
&gt; I'm debating on buying a *decent* 71 single cab ($1,000), should I save my 
&gt; money for a split window double or single cab?  (ie what do yins guys like 
&gt; better?)  (I would prefer a splity)

If you prefer the split, then buy one!

I bought my bus to drive, so a '71 was ideal.  IF I was more interested in
restoration for shows I would get a split.  Go with what you like!
