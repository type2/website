Hello!

&lt;&lt; My guess is that SOMEONE in KC or maybe closer 
has a good tranny/redux box that they'd sell reasonable. 
Anyone? &gt;&gt;

It figures!  I was in KC for a week during the last of Aug.
I travel light and with only carry on baggage.  That would
have left me with the option of 3 checked bags and I'm
sure I could have managed to get a trans out there with
me!  My transaxle parts suppliers tell me all the time of
other customers calling them trying to locate someone
in the Midwest willing to work on these cars.  Too bad I
like the Northwest as much as I do!  The food in KC is
simply great and some bright, hot sunshine is nice in
the summertime!
