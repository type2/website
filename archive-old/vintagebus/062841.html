Subject: RE: [VB] Re: [T2] A/C for a Baywindow

  I was just looking at the Dealer Training book on AC and an interesting
thing in it is the required HP according to ambient temputure, for every 5
degrees in outside temp it increase the compressor head temps by 10 lbs. For
every lb of increased head temp requires more HP to run the compressor.
After reading this the claim of 1 1/2 hp to run the compressor can make
sense at lower outside temps.
  Example  90 degrees outside temp creates 99.6 lbs of head pressure whereas
110 degrees outside temp creates 136.0 lbs of head pressure, thus more HP to
run.
  Another weird fact is that the 71-73 campmobile uses 34 oz's of freon
where the 73-74 uses only 28.
  These facts are out of the in-dealership training boxes I have

&gt;Are you sure he didn't mean 2 condensors?

Either way, he's got to use at least 12.5 HP to pump 32,000 Btu/hr of
heat around.  It also seems like that if the kit uses 2 16,000 Btu/hr
condensors then the single evaporator needs to be around 32,000 Btu/hr
in order to suck in enough heat to keep the condensors fully occupied.
 
&gt;With todays new A C compressors, a alternater robs more H P from an 
&gt;engine then the A C compressors!!!

A/C compressors and alternators are still subject to the laws of
physics.  Bosch suggests that alternators are 50% to 65% efficient
at changing mechanical energy to electrical energy, depending on
speed and load.  They also give typical belt drive efficiencies
of 94 to 97%.

Let's take a 14 V 50 A late-model alternator.  This produces 700 W
of electrical energy.  Therefore, it needs around 1080 to 1400 W
of energy at the alternator pulley, or 1110 to 1490 W of energy
at the crankshaft pulley.  1 HP is 745.7 W, so the alternator
will be pulling 1.5 to 2 HP at full load.

Putting 2 HP into a perfectly efficient A/C system will yield 5,100
Btu/hr of cooling - in reality you will get less.  I do not know what
a reasonable Btu/hr requirement is for automotive air conditioning,
but given that the A/C vendor quoted the original dealer-installed
Bus A/C at 12,000 Btu/hr and is planning his system to handle
32,000 Btu/hr, I would suggest that 5,100 Btu/hr is not enough.
