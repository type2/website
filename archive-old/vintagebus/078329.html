&gt;The NOS in-dash units came with an interlock switch to prevent that --
&gt;the carb won't close when the coil's hot (brilliant and unhackable,
&gt;especially when the short-term memory's gone), so you just suck air.

I know that the stock Eberraucher bongs have these, but do the Westwind
ones have them?  I hear you get more flow out of the Westwinds, but if
they don't have the interlock, that could lead to impermissible
deviation from the specifications laid down by the Volkswagenwerk.

Coming soon: an article on how to replace the expensive stock electronic
control box on an Eberraucher with three relays and a Lava Lamp...

&gt;Strictly doobs while on the road, I say -- preferably sized to match
&gt;the cigar lighter.

You're a purist; you won't drive a water-cooled _anything_.

ObBus: Do you know what's behind _your_ trim panels?  I made it a point
to check behind all of mine when I got the Bus.  I don't mean that
every Bus is loaded with paraphenalia, but it's been a long, long trip
from Wolfsburg in 1950 to your driveway in 2003.  I didn't find anything
other than dirt, rust flakes, and Bus parts, but now I feel more secure
when I'm gettin' hassled by the Man.
