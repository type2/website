Subject: Re: brake upgrade, heater channels, fuel gauge, rivets

When you get the good rivets, I believe, if my memory serves me
correectly, that the first little bit of rivet forming starts with a round
convex surface, as if you were pressing the end of the rivet with a large
ball bearing. That serves to send the edges outward. Then a
flat-to-concave piece of hard steel should finish the forming process on
the end of the rivet. THis all happened  9 years ago, and was over in a
flash as well. You can prolly get away with a careful and aware use of the
vise grip (10&quot; size is better than the 7&quot; for this, plus you need it in
your tool kit anyway), and a small flat piece of steel for the forming
surface. Get several extra rivets, and practice til you get the technique
down. Then your riveted windows will look pro.

&gt;     Thanks to Cal G. and Jason W. for the help. I don't know how I missed those rivets at Wolfsburg West. And I'll try the Vise-Grip maneuver.
&gt;     As to the MC, I'm gonna go ahead and get the Brazilian one since no one has any gore-riddled testimonies to sway me otherwise.
&gt;     That elastomer sleeve for the heater channels looks to be perfect, though it is a little pricey. Hmm... do we want that new car radio/CD player with the satellite receiver for non-stop tunes on the road, or a warm interior.
&gt;     I'll definitely get the new gas gauge though. Hate to walk across the desert ala Clark Griswold due to an error in fuel level judgment. Thanks again,
