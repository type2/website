&gt; Hi all;
&gt; The attached Letter to the Editor was published in
&gt; my local paper this
&gt; morning. I cannot let this one pass...I have to
&gt; write back. &lt;Snip!&gt;

Hello everyone!  I'm normally a lurker on this list. 
I'm a big fan of vintage VWs (my first car was a 1967
Beetle - Babette the Bitchen' Bug we called her, God
rest her soul) and have always liked the split-window
busses, though I haven't acquired one yet (anybody got
a '67 Kombi or Standard they want to let go really
cheap? &lt;Grin&gt;)  Anyway, this particular thread caught
my eye and I decided to respond.  I currently have two
cars, a 1976 Volvo 245 wagon and a 1987 Dodge Raider
(aka Mitsubishi Montero).  I bought the Raider several
years ago when I moved to New Orleans because I wanted
an enclosed truck-like vehicle that would be tough
enough to withstand the abuse that New Orleans streets
dish out, and that would sit high enough off the
ground to avoid being flooded when the rains come
pouring down and the levees start to crack.  My Raider
was well-suited to the tasks.  It was actually shorter
than many passenger cars on the road, making it very
easy to park.  It is a basic on-road/off-road vehicle.
 Luxury items include...air-conditioning and an AM/FM
radio with not one, but TWO speakers!  It rides like
a...well, like a truck, but what a great little SUV! 
I think that the car-makers' idea of &quot;bigger is
better&quot; is waaaay off the mark.  I live in Texas, and
practically everywhere I look I see these tiny 100 lb.
women negotiating railroad tracks at a snail's pace in
a truck large enough to invade a small country!  It's
insane!  The automobile manufacturers also seem to
have forgotten that SUV is an acronym for Sport
UTILITY Vehicle.  Just how &quot;utilitarian&quot; is a &quot;Luxury
SUV&quot; with leather appointments, power windows, power
door locks, power seats, and a 6-speaker
surround-sound stereo?  I say, if you want a luxury
car, buy a Lincoln Towncar or a Cadillac Seville.  I
believe that SUV's have their place, and the luxury
car market isn't it.

My daily driver is the Volvo.  It's a brick, true. 
It's heavy and clunky and aparagus-green, but it's
also very reliable and simple to fix when it does
break.  Not much luxury here, either (A/C is about
it), but I like it that way.  &quot;Simple By Choice.&quot; 
It's that simplicity that's going to ensure that my
cars are still on the road in 10, 15 or even 20 years.

I seem to have strayed a bit, I think, from any bus
content, so I will sum it up by saying: Long Live The
Air-Heads, (Busses In Particular)!

Thank you, and goodnight.
-Ken in the Sleepy Little Town Of Houston, Texas
