&gt;A friend has a wierd fan that mounts to the crank where the pulley would
&gt;normally mount. It's about 12&quot; in diameter.

Does it have a belt groove in it?  If so it might be for a Type 3 with
the fan on the back of the engine.  Or, it could be an aftermarket part.
I think I read someplace about a fan that was supposed to bolt on to
the crank pulley and stir up the air in the engine compartment, thereby
promoting better cooling.  Mostly it promoted finger loss, though.
