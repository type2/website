&gt; Isn't it easier to use a 10mm socket on an extension to undo the gen tin 
&gt; and a 13mm on the same extension to let the genny rotate into view?

Hello Harry  That is one way  Another is to remove the pulley so that you can 
see what you are doing.  I do it the harder way but there are some things 
that make it easier.  Make a hook out of a metal coat hanger to hold the clip up 
for the brushes and when reinstalling the lower screw electric tape the screw 
to the screw driver so that you don't have to worry about dropping it,   I can 
normmally do the whole job in the same time as it takes to rotate the genny.  
Also you can't get to the bottom bolts on the tin without a long 10mm wrench 
and pray to god that some dumbass hasn't put screws in the place of the bolts  
:)   Later and have fun  Mark Dearing
