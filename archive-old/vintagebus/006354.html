All this is fine with me but...... I need a car that can haul my family of
four plus a dog every time we decide to hit the road and be a class act as
well........... I need to take my clients out once in a while....... it
would look funny to take clients on showings in a little tiny Echo or
Prius..... I've done it in my Geo when I first started in this business. I
just though that if I can get into a Passatt or Jetta with a nice, fuel
efficient diesel powerplant I will be able to kill two birds with.........
you know what I mean..
Bus content as it's not Friday anymore........ I'm picking up my 65 next
Saturday.... FINALLY!! (after six months of negotiations with the seller and
two price hikes.......)wish me luck......


PS. I know that I could restore my Bus for about $6000 and keep the rest in
my pocket but for me, my Bus is gonna be my treasure. I usually put about
100-150 miles on the odometer every day.....

&gt; There is some fault with this logic
&gt; at the equator there is only (very) approxmately 50% land mass so one
&gt; only needs to drive one half the miles to get around the world unless
&gt; you have to drive the bus all the time on the ferry boats to power them
&gt; Therefore you can double the number of times you go around the world
&gt; or save the fuel for the next VW meet
