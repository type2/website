Subject: Re: [VB] Let There Be Light!!!!!!!!

Yes , i always keep my brakes adjusted. I rearended some one in my
singlecab. the van in front of me was new and stoped a whole lot faster than
i could. I wasnt tail gateing but it all happend so fast that there was
nothing i could do. I actually think that teh stock brakes work well but I
have a spare 68 beam . Also I cant justify spending $400 on king and
linkpins and another $160 on front wheel cylinders. and still have small
brakes with a small master cylinder. My ball joint front end has new brakes
and ball joints, and i will be able to upgrade to Disk in the future. i
understand there will be a stiffer ride but that fine.
