&gt; but you didn't say where you got the idea that VW designed these to be driven
&gt; at WOT.

Muir wrote that the VW can run at 5500rpm for several miles, say pulling a hill
in third;&lt;)

Also, if VW designed a car that could be driven so fast as to total the engine
unless you &quot;held back&quot;, do you really think the vehicle would be popular? Or
that law suits out the wazzoo would not ensue? Have you EVER seen a warning from
VW about overreving the T2 in 4th?

&gt; If so, how do you explain the rev limiters that came on the motors some years
&gt; (VW installed on new cars, not the berg edition)?

Because in gears other than 4th, you can overrev an engine.

I used to push a '60 T2 with a bastard 40. Set the linkage so that when the
pedal was on the floor, the butterfly was at wide open. Ran 60-63 at top end. It
would not pull any more.

If you look at the power curve for a VW, the Maximum output in BHP is at
4000rpm. As you increase rpm, BHP drops. So right at the time you need more BHP
(to go faster) your engine peters out. Its pure physics, the engine can only put
out so mush power, period. If you try to drive faster than the BHP you have to
push it, who do you think is going to win? You or physics?

Again, its your ride. Believe what you want.
