Subject: Re: [VB] Someone stole my engine?

Scott
did you make a webpage about the tracker? Since Im too lazy to scan the
archives can you tell me where the info was?



&gt; My wife's car was stolen and found a day later with the engine (and a few
&gt; other things) missing.
&gt;
&gt; My daughter's '71 Bug was stolen a couple of weeks ago, but the guys were
&gt; busted before they were able to remove anything.
&gt;
&gt; I have been busy the last week building trackers for all my vehicles,
&gt; here's my daughter's car
