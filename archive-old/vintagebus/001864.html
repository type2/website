I would like to thank everyone on the list for their help on by
carb/distributor issue.  I found an excellent write up on the 34PICT3.
Boston Bob's write up also.  I am an old FV &amp; FSV driver and it is all
starting to come back now.  In my spare parts bin I found a Solex and Bocar
34PCIT3.  Went throught them both and came up with the Solex as the better
of the two.  I notice that the main jet in the Bocar is different than the
Solex.  Ended up with a 130 main, plugged the hole in the butterfly, set the
timing, set the carb, and the little jewel purrs like a kitten.  When I was
racing, I had a jet gauge and reamer st to make my own jets for the 28 we
had to run.  When I retired I kept all my tools and equipment except the
speciality tools for the FV.  Is possible to find a jet gauge and reamer
tool now or just go with a set of metric drill bits?
Off vw for a moment, I belonged to another car club that had the same great
involvement that this list has.  They started flaming each other and taking
sides.  Before you knew it the internet page fell apart and two different
groups started.  It hasn't been the same since (sad).  It would be a shame
to see the same thing happen here.  Lets  keep up the great work and help
and be happy.
