Subject: re:clutch cable issue

Well I got the clutch cable off, thanks for the tip Eric &amp; Barb. It turns
out I was trying to take the clevis pin out of the end of the cable, instead
of just taking the clutch cable operating lever. I did the same thing once
before, but this time I broke the little piece that holds the clevis pin in.
So I may need to change the cable anyway, or figure out a way to get a
clevis pin in there.

I got the pedal linkage out, it took a lot of prying. Unfortunately I
skinned one of the wires nearby-luckily it was only the outer protective
coating. So I can re-wrap with electrical tape.

When I put the linkage back in, it has some play. I was wondering how much
play it should have, and how to know if I need to replace the bushings in
there?

If I were to replace the bushings, where do you get new ones, plus where do
you get the pilot tool for removing the old one and inserting the new one?
