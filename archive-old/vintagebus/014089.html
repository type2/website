I wasn't deriding you or your bus; I was simply illustrating how
expensive it is to get a nice deluxe done these days.  I should be the 
LAST one to talk about dumping money in a bus and then trying to get it
out.  I have &gt;$20k into my 54 deluxe, and if I were to have to sell
today, I would be taking it up the back door, because there is no way in
hell I'd be able to sell it as a half-completed project.  Half?  Maybe 1/4
completed.

&gt; round about manner. I have to do personal e-mail to vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com.
&gt; It is quite annoying but it has been a long time sitting and biting my
&gt; tongue because I could not get through. I still don't know what the problem
&gt; is with this e-groups list. I have unsubbed and resebbed about 6 times. My
&gt; other e-groups list I am on is not a problem it works great.

The problem is this list is NOT an e-groups list.  The software, server and
connection (that Steve Dolan pays for out of his own pocket) that
the vintagebus and type2 lists run on (and type2_dot_com) are in no way, shape 
or form connected to the e-groups entity.  The e-groups access
was someone's clever but hare-brained idea, which worked for a while, 
but e-groups has changed things a couple times, repeatedly breaking it.  The 
list admins collectively decided to abandon support for posting via egroups.
