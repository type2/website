Supposedly the local VW dealer's original Beetle &quot;demonstrator&quot; [~'52-'53]
was just such a vehicle.

I drove that bug in a local Mobilgas Economy Run in September 1954,
anticipating a shoo-in victory, but we got beat by a Crosley station wagon!

Maybe if it had been VW factory built :) .....

This raises an interesting issue, however.  For years VW made much of the
fact that all &quot;improved&quot; or &quot;revised&quot; parts/components could be retro-fitted
to an earlier model without modification or adaptation.  If your fender, for
instance, got banged up it was replaced with a new part that was of the
latest design but fully compatible with the older vehicle.  It was not
uncommon to see a Beetle owned by a frugal person that had mismatched bits
hanging all over it, including in the engine compartment.  This probably
explains some of the anomalies we find on early VWs.

&gt;&gt;  I have an old Foreign Car Guide that has an article about a bunch of
guys working at a dealership who built a bug from &quot;scratch&quot; using their
off-the-shelf parts, as a training excercise.  &lt;&lt;
