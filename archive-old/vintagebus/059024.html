It's just the standard time-sert repair kit #1812 for M8 x 1.25 threads.
The kit comes with 5 inserts as well as the drill bit, counter bore bit, tap
and installation driver.  It comes in a nifty plastic box with instructions
all for $48 which isn't bad considering I was able to do it myself.  Extra
inserts are pretty cheap too, $0.98/ea for up to ten and then there is a
price break schedule for larger quantities.  The plan is to go to RB but
maybe not in my bus:(  So if you need to see the kit I could bring it.  I'll
try to bum a ride with some bus person if possible to go there and back home
on the same day otherwise I'll be in the New Beetle and park in the *other
vehicle* area.

Thomas are you going to the red barn? Philip would like to see this tool, he
always looking for a new tool.
We will be there about noon Friday, it may be too hard to hook up at Kelly
Park
