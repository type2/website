Subject: Big Dents A Better Mouse Trap (DC)

--part1_17d.970a329.2a328b26_boundary

Can't
use a dolly here, unless you have one about 3 feet x 2 feet with a body
hammer about the same size.

       But you do have a dolli that big and you can get by with a body 
hammer.   I use my power ram and a piece of 4 X 4 lumber to push the dent up 
from underneath, I also have a piece of scrape lumber under the ram to spread 
the load.  You can do the same with scrape wood and a bottle jack.  Start 
pushing on the outside of the dent, using your body hammer to stress relieve 
the metal outside the dent.  You'll have to move your jack around the dent 
several times and you may not get the dent out all at once.  But with the 
jack supplying the muscle, you won't get worn out.  I myself use a 6 ft 
straight edge to check the progress.  Once the big stuff is done you can move 
onto the ribs, I have a piece of scrape iron that I ground down to fit the 
SC-DC ribs.  This screws to my 4 X 4 on the end of my ram.  I go at the ribs 
the same way.  Working from the outside of the dent to the center.  Any other 
small dents can be filled with body filler, or if you happen to have a stud 
gun, you can metal finish up the rest of it.

Why work harder than you have too???

                                                                       Frank
