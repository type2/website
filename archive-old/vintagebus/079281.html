Subject: Re: [VB] manual choke installl in 60-67 bus?

Regarding adding a manual choke to a bus -
I put one on my '69 Jeepster when I rebuilt the carb- makes a lot of
difference. Depending on how correct you wish to be, most auto parts
stores sell generic push/pull cables &amp; housings. I think mine was about
$8.00. The only trick is in the orientation when you install it. Due to
the way the choke is on the Jeep, the cable stays pulled out 99% of the
time, and pushed in to choke it, which is the opposite from all the stock
manual chokes I've seen. I'm sure you could rig something functional very
easily and cheaply, whereas you might have a bit more invested to do it to
meet the approval of the ghost of Pon...
