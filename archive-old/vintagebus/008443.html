Hello everyone.

I don't mind the cross posts, the junk posts, the flames, and can even
tolerate the 4 letter words that have popped up recently. But tolerating
them, and WANTING them on the bus list is two different things.

I have learned so much, and have built up my confidence to actually try and
work on my '64 panel. Thanks to that DD Panel BD Walkthru, Deluxe Roof  hack
custom job that many so affectionately bashed, I bought a quality Miller MIG
welder. This thing welds so great that I haven't turned the darn thing off
much since I fired it up.  Hell it almost looks like I know what I'm doing
( Thanks GoBuggin_at_aol_dot_com ).  Because of him I also just ordered my eastwood
stud welding system to pull out the dents that I have lurking in the
corners.  Another thing is that I wouldn't have realized you can cut the
tops off of old rusty doors, and graft them back into the bottoms of the
panel doors that I need to fix, without the bus list.  This a really good
resource for those of us that don't have ANY experience working, driving,
and really digging these old boxes on wheels.

What I'm trying to say is, if it's not FRIDAY please lets try and keep at
least some MANDATORY bus content in the posts.  The, &quot;Oh, I saw a bus on the
road today driving to Wal-Mart&quot;, really doesn't cut it.

Here's my Mandatory Bus Content:

Today I ordered two outside passenger side rockers for a bus since they
don't make a drivers side replacement for the double door. I know that it's
going to be a little off, but how bad? Has anyone done this before? Also, I
had posted around X-Mas that I would be trying to make some middle sections
of front floors for my bus. I had a few people interested in buying some
panels if I made them up, but alas, I haven't been able to find the emails.
Please re-email me, and I will keep a list of people that want these things.
I will try and put updates on my website to show people how they turn out.

Ok, I got out my Asbestos Underoos so let me have it if you want, but please
consider I'm not starting a war, just trying to wave the white flag.

Thanks
Charles
