Subject: RE: [VB] Double Cab Project

Hi Thom,

That tube is for heat to the rear passengers...  I can't tell much from the
picture of the seat but it should hinge on the top like the front bench
seat.

&gt;&gt;&gt; I do have some double-cab questions though:

* I don't think this rear seat is correct:
http://www.vintagebus_dot_com/gallery/image/2001871.JPG - it's reminiscient of
the flat seat that was in my '55 westy.  The bus came with another seat,
which is more like the one in my 60

* what is this tube?
