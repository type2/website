Hey Volks

The Ratmobile and I just returned from a 4,200km journey
around the country. I took my daughters to the Easter
Splashy Fen music festival before returning them to their
mother in Somerset West, near Cape Town.

We had planned to leave Johannesburg at the crack of dawn on
Wednesday 7 April, but I still had business to complete and
we only left town after lunch. I considered delaying
departure until the next morning but then thought, to hell
with it, we'll drive as far as we can then find a place to
camp.

So me and my daughters, Giulia, 11, and Laura, 9, threw all
our gear in the back of the van and left town, with a
pick-up front roof clip and some other bits on the roof rack
for my friend Paul Cochrane in Stellenbosch, who needs it
for Farouk, the rusty Fleetline wide-bed pick-up he is
restoring.

As the sun set we reached Sterkfontein Dam, about 350km from
home, on the edge of the escarpment, and set up camp. After
a light dinner of soup and rolls we rearranged the interior
for sleeping: Giulia and I on mattresses on the floor, and
Laura on a matress above the engine compartment.

We awoke early next morning but got off to a leisurely
start. Then began the descent down the escarpment via the
Oliviershoek Pass, and a brief stop in the village of
Bergville to meet a fellow busser with whom I'd had an email
correspondence. Bart Bervoets is a young Belgian working in
South Africa. He showed me his 1970 Kombi in the panel shop,
as well as a 1971 Deluxe he hopes to restore. No splitties
left in his area, unfortunately.

Then it was back on the road to our destination, Splashy
Fen, near the village of Underberg at the foot of the
southern Drakensberg mountains, in KwaZulu-Natal province,
and about 600km from Johannesburg. The Rat was running
flawlessly as we made good time on back roads. Eventually, I
got off the recommended route and hit a 64km gravel track
along the base of the mountains. Shorter than taking the
tarred road the long way round, but no quicker, as the track
was quite rough and twisty for the full distance. But it was
worth it for the views.

We arrived at Splashy Fen just after lunch and immediately
set up camp (awning and old canvas Kombi tent), before I sat
and relaxed with a beer while the girls went off to explore.

A guy came to visit who had seen me drive in with the bus.
He had a 67 Westy. We talked buses for a while, before he
left, inviting me to come and see his bus. In the evening I
went off to see some of the bands playing before going to
bed early. Splashy Fen is a four-day music festival
showcasing local musicians, which makes a great change from
the usual rave DJs at these outdoor events. DJ-driven dance
music has all but killed live bands. It makes me feel old:
&quot;Remember the days when music was played by people with
instruments?&quot;

Friday I got up late and spent the day lazing around and
checking out some of the festival sights. I didn't spot the
67 Westy, but I did find a 62 camper with safaris, but the
people were elsewhere.

Late in the afternoon Gisela arrived with our friend Sara
and Sara's three children. The rest of the weekend was spent
much the same way, lazing, hanging out, meeting people,
watching live bands and generally having fun among the other
5 000 festival goers.

On Sunday morning the guy with the 67 Westy sought me out
for assistance getting his bus started. He said it had been
running really badly on the way in. I reset the timing and
we got it started, but there was no power at low revs. He
hit the road anyway, promising to contact me later. I
noticed that the people in the 62 camper had also left
before I could meet them. Damn, I didn't photograph either
bus.

On Monday morning we all broke camp before heading out to
Underberg, where we had lunch together before parting ways:
Gisela and Sara and her kids back to Jo'burg, and me and my
girls in the opposite direction, headed to Cape Town. After
lunch we pointed the Rat south and east, to get around the
mountainous region of Lesotho, a country completely
surrounded by South Africa.

We crossed large stretches of rural Transkei, a heavily
populated area of rolling green hills. About an hour before
sunset I took a logging track into a pine plantation with
the idea of finding a place to camp. But the ground was too
steep and we couldn't find a level place to park, so we
retraced our tracks to the road and pressed on to the next
village, Elliot, 400km from Splashy Fen, where we
established ourselves at the municipal campsite, on a lake
rich with bird life and overlooked by a bizarrely weathered
sandstone mountain.

The campsite caretaker was not there, and there was no hot
water. Oh, well, another day without a shower won't do us
any harm.

We awoke at first light and were on the road before 7am. We
spent the whole day driving westwards across the Karoo, an
arid region in the centre of the country. We ended our day's
drive at a beautiful private camp at De Rust, having driven
about 750km for the day. And bliss, there were hot showers!

Next morning we were up at first light again, before
starting the day with some scenic detours. We headed first
through the Swartberg mountains via Meiringspoort, a
spectacular drive along a river that has cut right through
the mountain range, to the quaint village of Prince Albert,
where we had breakfast at the hotel, before heading back
over the top of the mountain, this time via the Swartberg
Pass, which remains much as it did when it was built 150
years ago.

So far, although the weather had been sunny, temperatures
were rather fresh. But once over the mountain we were into a
30C day as we made our leisurely way to Cape Town, stopping
frequently to enjoy the sights. During the day the bus's
engine started to get very loud; it sounded like a leaking
exhaust, which I made a note to check out in Cape Town. We
eventually reached my ex-wife's home in Somerset West in the
early evening, after driving 600km for the day.

After dinner, I said my goodbyes to my girls, then left to
visit my sister and her family, who also live in Somerset
West. The next morning I went and had the Rat steamcleaned
prior to giving her a service, and bought some 30 weight oil
and sump and tappet cover gaskets, as well as a silencer
mounting kit and exhaust flange sealant. Then I drove the
60-odd kilometres to Cape Town where I spent the day and
night with some friends.

The next morning I made my way out towards Stellenbosch,
where Paul Cochrane lives on a farm. He has a 1964 Kombi
camper and the aformentioned Farouk the Fleetline pick-up,
and he had arranged a get-together of local splitscreen bus
drivers to coincide with my arrival. The day began with a
heavy obvercast and soon it was pouring with rain and
getting cold. Out on Paul's farm I parked the Rat in a shed
and changed the oil and gave her a tune-up, before resealing
the silencer to heat exchanger joints. The exhaust was still
noisy, sounding very throaty, but I had no more time to
check it out as the bus gathering had begun.

In all, eight different splitties and their drivers showed
up for an impromptu bus show. It was great meeting other bus
people and we all had a good day together, BSing and
checking out each other's buses.

After everyone left, Paul and his wife also left for a party
in another town, where they stayed overnight. They let me
stay over at their house, an interesting concrete igloo
construction. Next morning was Saturday and I planned to
start my return drive to Johannesburg, more than 1,000 miles
away, but only after meeting another splittie owner, Jean
Viljoen of Gordon's Bay. I was up before dawn and was packed
and ready to go just after sun-up. But then the Rat wouldn't
start. I thought about this and the fact that the exhaust
was still very noisy, and considered calling Jean and
cancelling our breakfast run and instead fix my bus
properly.

I was in two minds and decided to leave the choice up to the
Rat: start this time and we go; don't start and we stay and
fix things. The Rat started and we made the hour drive from
Stellenbosch to Gordon's Bay with no issues other than the
throaty roar from the engine.

I met Jean and his wife and their Fleetline Kombi at their
home in Gordon's Bay and then we convoyed along the False
Bay coast from Gordon's Bay towards Rooi Els, where we
picnicked at the roadside and talked buses for an hour or
so, before they returned home and I set a back-road course
for Johannesburg.

The Rat seemed to be running fine, but was difficult to
start and was making a very throaty roar that seemed to come
mostly from one cylinder. It sounded like a manifold leak,
but an inspection of the exhaust showed up nothing obvious.
I was puzzled and a bit concerned, but decided the best
thing was to press on regardless.

Over the course of the morning the noise got progressively
louder, and then the engine started leaking oil from the
cooler. WTF? I reached De Rust at sunset and went to sleep
thinking I'd have to deal with the bus next day. I got up
and hit the road early, heading away from the mountains and
into the progressively drier country of the Karoo.

Apart from the brain-battering noise, the Rat seemed to be
running fine. Because of the racket I was trying as much as
possible to drive at less than half throttle, and even so we
were easily maintaining 90km/h. We passed the small villages
of Willowmore and Aberdeen, but I figured I'd push on for
Graaff Reinet, a reasonable sized town, for lunch and to
take stock.

In Graaff Reinet I pulled up outside the main hotel and
parked. I got out to see a rapidly expanding pool of oil
under the bus, linked to a long black trail along the road
behind me. #%_at_^!!! The moron who built this engine had, in
their wisdom, dispensed with the studs that hold on the sump
plate; using bolts instead. One of these had fallen out and
all my engine oil had drained out onto the road. It was well
timed however. If I had not stopped when I did, severe
engine damage would have been the likely result. I watched
the last few drops of oil pour out onto the tarmac and
thought fokkit, I'll deal with it later, and went into the
hotel courtyard and ate a healthy lunch.

After eating I returned to the bus, donned work clothes,
replaced the bolt in the sump plate, and refilled the engine
with 30 weight. The engine compartment was a mess of oil
from the leaking cooler. It was Sunday afternoon and the
town was pretty much closed. No help here and I couldn't
even pull my engine without a hassle as I'd left my small
trolley jack at home. I figured that if I did need help it
may as well be as close to home as possible and hit the road
northwards again.

Just out of Graaff Reinet the road begins its climb to the
top of the escarpment at 6,000 feet. It was a warm day and
there was a headwind. The bus slowed to a crawl. Now it
definitely felt like it wasn't firing on all four. The
exhaust tailpipe had also come adrift from the silencer. I
stopped about 30km out of town and reconsidered. The next
village was another 80km away. I really felt that if I
pushed the bus now the engine would just blow up, so I
turned back to Graaff Reinet and set myself up in the local
campsite, deciding to seek help in town first thing on
Monday morning.

In the evening at the camp I was accosted by a fellow camper
driving an old Ford motorhome. He was a member of the Syncro
club and regaled me with tales of the club's trips and
adventures. He said he had read my magazine articles about
the ZebraSafari and they had discussed our adventures
several times in club meetings. We idly fantasized about
converting the Rat into a Syncro ...

Monday dawned with a heavy overcast. First thing I drove to
the local tyre and exhaust shop and had them braze the
tailpipe back on, which had no effect on the noise. It had
by now got so bad that it was very clearly emanating from
the left cylinder head and not the exhaust. The shop owner
kindly lent me a trolley jack and gave me a corner of his
yard to pull the engine.

I found that three of the lower head nuts had *come right
off!!* I reinstalled them and tightened them up, only to
find that the front lower stud had pulled from the case.
#$%&amp;!!! Well, that explained the infernal racket. I
tightened everything as best I could, leaving the pulled
stud loose, then retightened the oil cooler, before
reinstalling the engine. Whe I restarted the bus the noise
was much the same. Obviously the sealing face of number
three was burned, and in any case it wouldn't seal with a
pulled stud. I figured it was time for a stripdown and
helicoil the stud and find a new head, but after asking
around I established there was no air-cooled expert in the
town, and the FLAPS didn't have stock of engine gasket sets
or anything else for ACVW.

Then it started to rain and I realised I could accomplish
nothing further there and it was time to risk the road
again. I was still 900km from Johannesburg and due home that
day. It was 12 noon. Fortunately the arrival of the cold
front had shifted the wind and now a stiff breeze was at our
backs as we climbed the escarpment for 200km to the town of
Colesberg. The Rat was running better, although still
blowing out of number three. The oil cooler leak was better,
but still there. However, everything was running very cool
in the cold, wet weather and I figured we could keep on
moving. I prayed for the tailwind to blow us all the way
back to Jo'burg.

I was so tense the first 50km out of Graaff Reinet that I
was in danger of seizing my whole body up. Then I made a
conscious decision to just relax and enjoy the drive and if
we threw a rod, then we'd just handle it when it came up.
And so me and the Rat kept moving at a steady 80-90km/h the
rest of the afternoon and into the night. As sick as the bus
was, things did not deteriorate and the only real problem
was that fuel consumption had increased by nearly 50%. OUCH!

It rained for the first 450km of the drive, then I left the
rain behind in the evening as we passed the city of
Bloemfontein, although there was lightning in the rearview
mirror all the way back to Jo'burg. My prayers were answered
and the tailwind eased our passage to within 50km of home,
when things got very blustery in the build-up to a big
midnight thunderstorm.

The Rat and I eventually got home at 12.30 am. 900km in 12.5
hours. Not bad! 900km in a day is the longest I've ever
asked a split bus to drive, and I'd never before done it
with such a sick engine.

Gisela was overjoyed to see me back home. As I hit the sack
I thanked all my angels for keeping the wind at our back and
the metal gods for holding everything together through all
my abuse.

Despite the mechanical misadventures, another cross-country
bus trip safely completed! For some pictures from the

bus), search the vintagebus_dot_com gallery for the search term
