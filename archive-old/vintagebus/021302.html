Hi Les &amp; Clara,
Also the later wing nut cable has a bigger diameter stud on the end than the 
earlier plain nut type.  We found this out at a swap meet where our cable 
broke suddenly when we parked.  Pulled out the spare clutch cable we had on 
board, installed it, to find the rear adjusting nuts would not fit on!  Since 
we were at a swap meet we were able to purchase the needed wing nut!  Now we 
make sure to carry in each of our buses a spare clutch cable with a wing nut 
already fitted on to make sure it is the correct size.    Eric&amp;Barb
PS  We also carry a spare gas pedal cable which is far harder to drive a VW 
without than with a broken clutch cable.  EEE&amp;B
