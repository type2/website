There was some talk about factory re-conditioned motors recently and I am
quoting from a unit number survey, supplement #6 printed in 10/75 in
Germany which states:
&quot;With effect from October 1968 the series engine number will be ground out
during the reconditioning process and the exchange engine number will be
stamped-in in its place.  An exchange engine can be recognized by the
exchange symbol in front of the exchange engine number.&quot;
The exchange symbol pictured there is the typical VW logo surrounded by
two curved arrows.
