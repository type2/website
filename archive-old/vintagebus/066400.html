Subject: was Couple new items now window latchs

  My 1960 15 window, 1960 DD (had) and my 1963 have the non through the
glass latchs. My 1960
frankinfrugley, 1960 SC and my 1960 DC have through the glass latchs. A 1964
21 window in the shop now has through the glass. I have seen a 1958 23
window with the non through the glass latchs. 
  I talked to a customer yesterday who worked at a dealership in the late
50's, he was telling me how his job was removing the tempered windshields
and replacing them with laminated that the DEALERSHIP, had made at a glass
shop!

&gt;  Nobody has ever given a definite
&gt; date on when used but I have seen them used on buses from 1958 till
&gt; 1963.

My '62 has through the glass latches FWIW.
