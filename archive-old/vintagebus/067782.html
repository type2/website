Subject: Re: [VB] 64 Deluxe Resto Help

Finally got Rick to try out the nine spring 200mm PP and all their
slipping clutch troubles went 
completely away. Eric&amp;Barb
-------------------- Clip -----------------------
Hopefully my incentive and the weather will collide soon and I'll pull
the engine and expose the PP and Clutch disk. From that point I can make
some decisions.
I'm not normally hard on parts (150k + on my 83 Westy clutch) but I get
overly excited driving this 66 Westy. Makes me think my 83 Westy has been
dragging an anchor for the last eight years.
I see now why some people prefer the old Splitties.
They're just down right fun to drive.
