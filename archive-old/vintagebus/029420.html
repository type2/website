Hi Steve,

Following Bob Hoover's advice, I used an industrial grade satin black cut 50 - 50
with benzene.  Sprayed lightly on the cylinders to limit rust, an insulator, and on
the block to inhibit corrosion of the aluminum.  None on the cylinder heads.  None
on any inside case surfaces as the paint may not survive that harsh of an
environment.  I could see the clogged oil sassages and screen now. I am happy with
the result.  Your results may vary, consult your inner feelings before attempting
this process. Just remember, thin coat.

Mike D.
