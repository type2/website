Subject: Need 1500 piston ring set

Subject says it, I'm now looking for a standard bore set of 83.0mm
rings for the 2.0, 2.0, 4.0 1500 size, and/or a set of NOS 1500 pistons
only without barrels are fine.  Oddly I've seen like 5 sets of these rings
go on my favorite auction site NOS for like $15 a set never thinking
I'd need em until now.  This is for use in a watercooled 2.0 application.
I will pay reasonable cash for them depending on quality or trade
for something OEV, say a set of NOS German 2.0 rings, etc.

Thanks.
John
