 &gt;then primer used and spot putty and sanded smooth - smothness being the
trick to getting the seal to seal, and primer and paint and letting it all dry
and using roofing tar 
 
 You recommend using a sealant on the car, under the seal? 
 -  -- - --  - - -
yes- I use roof tar on the window ledge.   The seals available now are quite
functional, though not as good as the original.  To prevent stuff dripping
through inany tiny gaps, roofing tar is good.  Better than hard sealers, as
very summer or when it is warm it will mush and keep the gaps filled up.
Cheap.  Clean it up ASAP or it can stain white paint darker.   Rags and WD-40
cleanit up great.   you could even put it between the glass and the seal, to
help keep water out of there- which will also prevent fogging between the
glass (make sure the glass is very dryed out before installing)
 . . .. . ..  . .. 
 
 &gt;seal up where the wiper pivots go through or you will still get water in the
package tray.
 
 I am, getting water in my package tray now, as the windshield is leaking, and
I guess my wiper pivots must be leaking too, does a gasket go in here, or just
some silicone-type sealant?
  &gt;&gt;

there is a rubber grommet.   From the side it is H shaped, and goes through
the hole in the vody, with a washer type face at each side, and the wiper
pivot goes through it.  You shouldn't have to use sealant, but Imay have to-
as for some reason my 65 westy  is getting water in the package trya.  If you
reach up under there (wipers off please) you can feel for where it is
dripping.  Replacing the pivot grommets on a 65-67 is more work than on the 65
and earlier style, which I prefer, self parking wipers not withstanding.   And
I don't like what is sold aftermarket as wiper pivot grommets.  And it is NOT
two flat rubber washers either- there is rubber around the pivot tube shaft.
The face should be a tad wider than the washer on the outside- the repros I
have seen have a smaller face and too thick.  picky me
