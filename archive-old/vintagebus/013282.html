I don't know about other countries and/or states, but.....

For many years funny little furrin car dealers in Washington State, USA,
were allowed to register cars as the model year in which they were SOLD.

So when a new VW, Renault, DKW, Hillman, FIAT, etc., built by the factory
as a 1959 model, didn't actually sell until 1961 the dealer could legally
register the &quot;held over&quot; vehicle as (for instance) a 1961 model.

This procedure made the sales people very happy, but drove the poor parts
and service guys crazy trying to match replacement parts to the vehicles
in the shop for service.  

At some point wisdom and logic finally prevailed and this procedure was
legislated out of existence.  Even after this practice became illegal, a
&quot;grace period&quot; of a year or so was allowed so dealers could clear out
their old stock of &quot;new&quot; vehicles.

And now you know &quot;the rest of the story&quot;.....

&gt;&lt;&lt; Turns out that my &quot;1961&quot; doublecab is actually a December 1959
&gt; doublecab! &gt;&gt;
&gt;Hi Michael,
&gt;That would make it a 1960 model then.  VW took up the model change 
&gt;like USA 
&gt;automakers did and does, every 01AUG of each year somewhere after 
&gt;about 1953.
