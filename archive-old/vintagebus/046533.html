&gt;Just tell yourself you are driving a vintage vehicle.  You
&gt;also like to enjoy the scenery, and are not in a rush to get
&gt;through with your life.


That's a great way to put it! I just keep smiling and waving! Seems to
happen naturally when driving a Splittie. :-) I just think how
stressed out those other drivers must be, and how relaxed _I_ am. I
also try to leave early for everything now. ;-)

Life in the slow lane is where it's at!!  On the other side of the coin,
If I could get my wife and kids to realize that our bus is NOT a
Ferrari, I may get somewhere on time for once. . . ;-)  I think we've
read that darned Turttle &amp; the Hare story too many times. . .  Keep on
smilin' !!!!
