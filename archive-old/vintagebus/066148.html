Subject: Fw: [missouri_micros] Fallout announcement?

Hi all,

I'm forwarding this to the List for Steve White with 
the Missouri Micro's Chapter of NEATO about an 
upcoming VW Campout:


Hello everyone, 

We are planning the Fourth Annual Missouri Bus
fallout. We call it that because it is a fall event, and we are camping
out. Pretty clever, though we cant take credit, as the idea for the name
was suggested to us. This year I would like to emphasize that even though
it says &quot;bus&quot; in the name of the campout, it is an event open to ALL
Volkswagens, and people who like them. Come in your VW of any era, or come
in your non-VW and just hang out and enjoy some good company.

Details, Directions and Maps:
