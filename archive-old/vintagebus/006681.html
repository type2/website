There's always a first time for everything and today was one of those days,
drove the church bus with it's new governed 1600 in it. Thought there was a
problem because every time I would get to the shift marks on the speedo it
felt like the engine was dying off, would shift gears and varoooom power
again, would go to the shift mark on the speedo in the next gear and again
felt like the engine was dying, shift gears and varooom off it'd go. So what
it appears is that VW had there sh#t together when they put those governers
on, defiantly can't over rev. Can't wait to get out on the highway to see
how it does on the flats and uphill
