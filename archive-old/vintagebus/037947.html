&lt;&lt; Hey everyone-
 I've got a 1600 dp w/ a 34 pict3 carb and I want an oil bath air cleaner for 
 it---
 We all know they work best in everyday stock conditions, but I was wondering 
 what year bus oil baths will work?
 I am looking for a complete assembly w/ all the connectors/support tubes 
etc. 
 . . 
 Does anyone have a complete one?
 
 Thanks-Pete

well, you dont say what year bus you have.

I have run the 40hp and 1500 bus air cleaners on 1600s .   UNless you have 
some super fat motor (doesn't sound like it) that should work.   DO you have 
a copy of the Bentley manual 63 edition- very good for all splitties and has 
a nice section on aircleaners with pictures.  Also shows how to use the oil 
bath part from a 1500 on the hang on the left 40hp set up.  interesting.  

I went out to Capitol Forest last weekend in my 65 and drove about 40 miles 
on the dirt roads.  My engine compartment is very dusty.  Guess I should 
check the crud level in my air filter oil.   

A good source is your next local VW swap meet.

I do have a modified metal tube from carb to 1500 bus air cleaner where it 
has been made to fit a larger diameter carb top.    Any one care to use it?  

Clara
