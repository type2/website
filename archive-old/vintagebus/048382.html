Subject: Sunroof Cover Installation
To: Vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

I was contemplating recovering the sunroof on the 21 window that im picking 
up to bring home this weekend or early next week.

I was looking at the how to section on Thom's site and only saw mention of 
removing the screws, peeling it back, removing the rivits and then assembling 
in reverse order.  Is that all there is to it?

I know that the headliner piece is different. Just wondering about the cover.

Thanks
Dan Howard
