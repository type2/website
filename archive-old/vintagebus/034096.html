O K Thom, you must have been at an AZ. show in disquise at 1 time or
another, that's the same color VWhoward painted the engine compartment of
his BINZ, and was going to paint the whole bus in, heck you should have said
yellow (on the list)and he probally would have given you the paint for
free!!!!!!
