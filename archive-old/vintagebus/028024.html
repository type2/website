Hi. I just wanted to repost the EVERYBUS t-shirt order information, as well as
remind folks that the deadline is fast approaching. I MUST have your order in
hand by the first week of April, so I can place the correct order at the
printer. Thanks to those who have already sent orders...
 For those of you going to EVERYBUS 2001, here are the details
about pre-ordering event T-shirts, with a brand new design for this year. As
you may recall from last year, all the shirts got snapped up within the first
few minutes, so please order ahead of time.
 Shirts will again be $15.00, and are available by pre-order in sizes of kids'
large through adult XL. For an extra $5, XXL or XXXL are available. Long sleeve
shirts are also available for an extra $5. I will try to print up a few extras
to sell on-site, but please do us both a favor and pre-order if possible. The
deadline to pre-order is April 1, which means I must have your order in my hand
by then, as that is when I will be placing the final order with the printer.
You can pick your shirts up at EVERYBUS. I will be there early Friday, and am
usually pretty easy to spot.
:)
Here's what I need from you-

-check or money order for your order $15.00 per shirt
                                    +$ 5.00 per each XXL or XXXL
