the floor of the treasure box is also gray but the gas tank panels are the
same blue as the bus, underneath is gray, as are the back sides if the
engine lid and treasure chest door support arms. My goal is to repaint the
underside as close to original as possible, I am just wondering if the
finish is smooth, semi gloss, has the primer texture, is glossy or what?. If
you saw this bus you would understand my concern, there is really no other
way but right to do this bus. In all the buses I have owned this is the
straightest and most original rust free of them all (my old 64 Westy) comes
a close second though.

Things that make you go hmmm.

On my 63 Single Cab the underneath is the same color as the top...L380 
Turquoise.
Is your undercarriage the same gray as inside the 'treasure box' cargo area?
