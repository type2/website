&gt; Hi Everyone,
&gt; 
&gt;     Just as they say, &quot;GOOD THINGS COME TO THOSE WHO
&gt; WAIT. . .&quot; (long
&gt; enough, that is).  I just returned from tracking
&gt; down a lead about a local
&gt; farmer who was said to have a &quot;big ol' pile of VW
&gt; van crap&quot;.  Well, when I
&gt; got out to his house, we talked for a bit before he
&gt; led me out to an old
&gt; pole-barn (like where they keep hay bails).
