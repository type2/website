Subject: FS: Neway valve seat cutters

I have a Neway valve seat cutter set for VW engines that I'll offer to
the lists before I ebay it.  It's been sitting in my toolbox for
thirty years and in that time I've used it at least twice.  If you're
re-building engines on a regular basis this is a *must have* tool. The
Neway cutters are carbide cutters and do not wear like stones do. 
After cutting the seats, lapping is often unnecessary because the
angles are true.

The set consists of:

#204, #209 and #211 cutters (15 &amp; 46 deg for exhaust, 15 &amp; 46 deg for
intake, 60 &amp; 75 deg 3rd angle, respectively)

8mm and 11/32&quot; expanding pilots

T-handle and extension for turning the above cutters

Pilot pulling bar

Cleaning brushes

All in a high impact W. German (!) manufactured box.

I paid over $350 for this set in 1972. First $200 + postage owns it.

You can see pictures of a similar set at &lt;http://www.newaymfg_dot_com/&gt;
