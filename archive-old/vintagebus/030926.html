&gt;there are five buses where i live.
&gt;
there are not five buses where i live.

There may be 5  Buses at the house across  the street from me.
The owner always looks at my Bus and smiles.  Not the ok smile
of &quot;Hey there, nice Bus ya got&quot; but a weird smile of &quot;I have a
few of those that I bet you wish you could check out&quot;.  Dammit
man, stop smiling at me!  And stop watering your weed-infested
lawn by hand for  4 hours each day, all the  time staring dir-
ectly at my garage door.   It really creeps me out.   And keep
your donkey in check, it is really freakin' out my dogs.   And
cut back the hair on your jet-black Samoyed, how the heck  can
it even see?

Someday, I'm gonna sneak into your back yard and see what's
in your  hidden garage, I know you aren't  parking that S10
in there.  Maybe while I'm back there I'll do some trimming
because I'm really confused about how much acreage you have
There  might even  be a  few VWs  hidden back  there in the
weeds behind that abandoned 60s RV.

Wait, what was the  question again?  Sometimes I get con-
fused with... uh, reality?
