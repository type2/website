 It's only doing it on #1.  Push the high tension lead
 firmly into the cap and the cylinder dies.  Pull the lead
out so there's a bit of air space between it and the cap
tower and the sparks jump the air gap and the cylinder
fires.
&gt;
I don't know the answer but am curious, what color is the
spark?

Also, I wonder if it produces a hotter spark when it has to
jump the gap, kinda like when you shock someone, it hurts
more if your hand is a bit further away.

Swap spark plug?

'55 Kombi - Had baffling electrical problem once, turned
out it was a short/corrosion in the ignition switch wiring
giving less than 6 volts to the coil.  Symptoms: engine
would cut out when you stepped on the brake (electrical
pull to the brake light cutting out the coil power), random
stalling, hard to start one minute, started easy the next.
