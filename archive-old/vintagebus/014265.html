There is risk involved in any business deal. I have bought and sold parts
sight unseen from and with people I did not know. So far no snags. 

Events of the last year have shown listmembers that even the prominent and
well loved listees sometines fall out of grace with your money in there
pocket. 

This thread started with the guy in FL pointing out that some folks in NC
burned him on a deal. He is stuck with a bus that cannot be titled, hence
not legally drivable, because the title he received at purchase in  NOT the
title to vehicle he bought. Although this was a private business deal and
not a &quot;GFX sold me a motor that tossed a rod after six miles and wants me to
pay return shipping etc etc etc&quot;  it still seems wrong and I am glad I am
aware of it becuase it happened in my area. I will comtinue to be cautious
with my $$$$.

 Caveat emptor is without a doubt the rule of each deal. However, as has
already been said the list is one way people become aware. 

End Transmission
Chris
