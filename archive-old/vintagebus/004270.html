 First, my conclusions on the conversion kit itself. What I bought was the
disc brake conversion kit, which included adapter hubs, caliper adapter
brackets, new outboard wheel bearings, grease seals, axle nut lock taps and
caliper bracket mtg. bolts. I also bought the wide 5 (5x205) steel wheel
adapters and the dual circuit master cylinder ('71-'79 bus) and adapter kit
which  included the adapter spacer, mounting bolts, pushrod boot and rubber
seals for the fluid reservoir. I had to provide calipers and rotors from a
'73-79 bus and a brake fluid reservoir from a Rabbit. In round numbers, the
whole thing ran close to $800 (can't find the receipts right now).
  The components of the kit are well made, if not beautiful from a
machinist's point of view. I received one defective wheel adapter (bolt
pattern was off), which was quickly replaced. All of the bearing and seal
fits were correct, nothing too tight or too lose. The adapter hub is plain,
unplated steel. This is to be expected because plating would alter the
bearing fits, but the hub will rust quickly. The caliper mtg. bracket is
zinc plated to prevent rust. The wheel adapters are burned (either torch or
plasma) from 1/2 in. hot rolled steel. They are crude, but wholly
functional, I will paint them with Cold Galv (zinc rich coating) to inhibit
rust.
  Everything fit like it should. No misalignment of holes, all the right
thread sizes and bolt lengths. Many of the clearances between components
were quite close, but the only interference was the aforementioned
wheel/caliper housing. No modifications of the stock configuration of the
bus were required except for realignment of the connections to the master
cylinder. This was very important to me, as I didn't want to do anything
that couldn't be undone.
  I drove Rosie some more last night, feeling things out. The pedal is still
a little spongy, but I'm going to drive for a while before I bleed them
again. The brakes stop straight (hands off the wheel) and their is no
vibration or pulsation. I tried one hard stop and did manage to get the back
wheels to lock up. Eric and Barb reminded me of the need for a pressure
regulator for the back. The jury is still out on that one, but I suspect I
will get one to prevent lock-up and skidding during panic stops. So far, the
difference from the drum brakes has not been all that noticeable, but the
pads aren't seated yet, the system is not properly bled and I have yet to
really put them to the test. I have not noticed the 'hard pedal' that I was
led to expect from these discs without the booster. I hope it stays that
way.
  I will post a performance evaluation once everything is settled in.
