Subject: .Official EveryBus 2001 Caravan list

Hi,

I was gonna skip the carabus list this year but since I am completely 
stressed out why not.

If you are coming to EveryBus send me yourBTW email address and what 
area you are coming from. I will gather all the info and post it to 
the webpage so that people can contact each other for the purpose of 
carabusing. This seems to be a popular way to travel. The last few 
EBs saw buses coming in to the campground in packs. By the time the 
Canadians arrived I think they had ten other buses in their wake!

BTW, the weather is looking good for travel and camping.
