what you might have is a 6 volt pully on your gen/alternator in such case
you need a 111 903 137B (9.5X900) belt, i have run acrossthis situation
before.

Subject: [VB] Loose fan belt conundrum.


I would appreciate some help on a problem that has me stumped.  I have been
working w/ limited success for a long time to solve an overheating problem
in my 1970 Westfalia w/ a 1600 dual port motor.  By overheating I mean that
the Gene Berg dipstick sensor causes the oil pressure idiot light to flash
at 60 mph on an interestate w/ small, rolling hills on a warm day (70
degrees or more ambient temp)-i.e. 225 deg. F.  My CHT gauge runs around 300
deg. F.  I have looked at a very wide variety of potential causes which I
will not detail here, but one problem that I can't figure out is how to fix
the loose fan belt.  When I say loose, I mean that a new Continental 9.5X905
belt installed w/ no shims b/t the fan pulley halves is loose enough to slip
under load.  I have taken a variety of steps to fix this (each step involved
a different, new Continental 9.5X905 fan belt unless otherwise noted):

Original set-up:  stock crank pulley from an old single port motor (probably
1.9:1 ratio), generator, old fan pulley.  I did not measure the ratio of
turns of the crankshaft to turns of the fan.  An 2 yr old, stock fan belt
was loose w/ no shims b/t pulley halves.  Motor ran hot.

Replaced generator &amp; generator stand w/ rblt Bosch alternator and used,
stock alternator stand.  No change in overheating problem.  The ratio of
turns of the crankshaft to turns of the fan was appx. 1.7:1; the fan belt
was loose enough to slip w/ no shims b/t the fan pulley halves.

Replaced crankshaft pulley w/ one from a dual port bug.  This pulley has
three timing marks on it, which, according to the data I've looked at, means
that it must have come off a dual port 1600 bug motor.  Given this source, I
conclude that this must be at least a 2:1 ratio pulley.  The new pulley did
not help the overheating problem.  The ratio of turns of the fan to turns of
the crankshaft was appx. 1.7:1.  The overheating problem continued.

Replaced stock fan belt w/ Gates 9.5/10X920.  This fan belt is one size
smaller than the belt sold by Gates for the 1600 dual port motor (a
9.5/10X930).  The new fan belt helped some-the fan belt is tight w/ three
shims b/t the fan pulley halves.  However, the ratio of turns of the fan to
turns of the crank shaft is still 1.7:1.  The fan belt rides near the outer
edge of the fan pulley.  The motor seems to run a little cooler, but I
haven't been able to give it a good test yet.  I tried the next size down
Gates belt (9.5/10X905), but it is too tight to fit.

The low ratio of turns of the fan to turns of the crankshaft means that my
fan is turning slower than VW intended.  This is certainly not helping
cooling-by my calculation, fan speed is 15% less than spec (spec is at least
2:1 and was 2.1:1 on some motors according to Barb&amp;Eric).

I realize that many, many factors can contribute to overheating, and I have
addressed most of those.  Independent of the other factors however, my fan
speed should meet the VW specification.  I can't figure out what the problem
is though.  I have changed the crank pulley, fan pulley, and gen/alt stand
w/ no change in the problem.  What other components could possibly be the
cause here?  The motor is a new rebuild by a reputable builder, but the case
was line bored-could the crankshaft position have been altered by that
process in such a way as to cause this problem?  Any help appreciated.

Thanks,
