Hi Ed,
You will need to take your bumper parts to a chrome plater and have them 
straighten them out.  You will need to degrease all these parts before going 
to the powdercoater.  Then take them to your local powdercoater to have them 
sandblast and coat them.  Make sure to have them zinc primered first and then 
colored coated.  Cost?  Depends on how banged up your parts are.  What color 
coat you pick (IE diamond dust in it.).  How much is labor in your area, and 
how much of the work and how picky you are.   Eric&amp;Barb
