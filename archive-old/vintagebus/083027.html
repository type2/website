Subject: Re: [VB] Stewart Warner gas heater

----- Original Message ----- 

&gt;I was wondering if a Stewart Warner gas heater from a Bug will fit in a 63 
&gt;Panel?
&gt;
&gt;

With enough fabrication it will, but &quot;bug&quot; gas heaters and &quot;bus&quot; gas heaters 
were configured differently for different mounting styles. If that's all you 
can find, I would say that it would be worthwhile to make it work. 20K BTU's 
of heat sure does make a bus feel a LOT warmer!!
