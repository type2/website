Hi Don,
1.   If they have 30,000 or more miles on them.  We would suggest tearing 
them down to long blocks and retorqueing all the case and head fastener and 
cleaning out all the cylinder and head fins of debris and casting flash.
2.  Go through all the engine cooling tin to make sure all pieces are there 
and each piece matches the other pieces you are using.  Plus install 
thermostat flaps system if you drive it in weather below 70F often.
3.  Check cooling fans to be at least 33mm, 34mm, or better yet 35mm wide 
inside measurement.  
4.  Install a Shradek made oil filter pump on the engine for the 65 to keep 
the bearings from being prematurely worn from the metalic debris/dust going 
through them!  Unfortunitly due to the rear engine hanger used on 68-71 buses 
this will not fit your 71 bus as of yet.
5.  Install a 68-71 gas tank in your 65 bus to get 15 gallons instead of the 
10ish gallons pre-1968 bus tank.  Installing reserve switches really helps to 
shut off the fuel when removing the engine or replacing the flexable fuel 
lines.  No more laying under your bus in a pool of fuel and on trips where 
you might run out of fuel you can manually switch to reserve by reaching 
under your bus if you do not install the reserve cable.  Also helps as a 
theft prevention when left in off position.
6.  Do mantainance/inspection on your clutch systems and trannys.
7.  Also a good time to do any scheduled maintainance and inspection on the 
steering, suspension and brakes.  All of which are more important then the 
engine itself!
