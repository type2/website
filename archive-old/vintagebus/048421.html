I have had both and my experience is that Westy always used the Jalousie
(sp?) windows. Those are the ones with the several slats of glass. Sundial
usually used the windows where the whole unit swings out. It almost seems
as though Sundial used what ever they had though. I have seen Sundials with
at least three different types of windows. None of this is from hard solid
facts, just what I have seen around.
