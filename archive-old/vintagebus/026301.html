&gt; dont look so stupid.  have a great scanner but cant seem to get the file
&gt; correct or whatever it takes thanks, vwhoward

Howard and anyone else in this situation:

The list is set up so you *cant* post....but...

If you have bus content pics and would like to put them on the web, and
have no place to put them, feel free to send them to me and I will put
them on the web and give you a URL you can give to the list so everyone
who wants to can see them.

This is a free service for bus related content. No commercials on the
web pages, no BS. My ISP has given our local club a whole bunch of web
space we will never use.

I would also be willing to make some limited web pages, text, or
whatever and post them for listees, as time permits. If you have
something that should be up for all to see, let me know.
