Until, of course, said brakes overheat and lose all stopping power.  I
had this happen during some night time &quot;try to find the campsite&quot;
mountain driving.  It was really quite disturbing.  So, the real
answer is &quot;it depends on what your local road conditions are&quot;.

Btw, it's illegal in at least some mountainous states to have the
vehicle in neutral while moving, particularly and specifically on
downgrades (I guess they figure no one'll be wanting to do that while
going uphill).  You can use the clutch, though.  I believe this is in
response to runaway trucks whose brakes have overheated (i.e., the
scenario I was in above, except my bus didn't *quite* run away).
