Subject: Re: [VB] Upper 3rd or Lower 4th?

speeds right around 40mph.  That's right on the shift point from 3rd to 4th 
gears.  Typically is it smarter to run a little slower and stay in 3rd gear 
(higher engine rpms, more cooling and all) or toss it up into 4th (lower 
revs, etc) and lug it a little but actually do the speed limit? &gt;&gt;

Hi Taylor,
Never lug it below 1,500 RPM especially in the upper three forward gears or 
it will beat the main bearing to death.  If you have to over rev it over 
3,000 RPM for a few minutes, but in the long run especially in 70F+ weather 
it would be best to just go a little slower in third gear.   Eric&amp;Barb
