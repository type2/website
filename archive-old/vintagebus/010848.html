I remember a guy at the classic who had a STACK of NOS seats lined 
up......not too long ago either.
He didn't have one for my 61 sunroof walkthrough bus. =(
I only have ONE NOS interior panel in the 57, the forward cargo door because 
mine had a big tear in it.
I'd take more if I ever found them!
I remember seeing headliners in boxes when i first started playing with 
busses, LOTS of the rear right side interior panel (triangle shaped), bunch 
of forward cargo doors.......couple pairs of cargo doors, one long interior 
panel got a turkis bus......
Grey kick panels.
Never seen NOS upholstry sold seperately......but i havent been into it very 
long.
I think ht ebus farmers had a stash of NOS seats that were take offs form 
some camper company.
Wish they had one for my 56!

 Dammmmmmn, nice set of Buses!
 
 I'm curious, I've never really heard of someone buying or selling NOS seat
 upholstery, was this really available or did you have to buy a whole seat
 back in the day?
 
 I know Greg Noble has some NOS door panels on his '57 Standard, ooooh, 
pretty.

yes you could go to the dealer and buy new seat covers for your bus, in 
assorted stock colours.:) Nice and clean and soft and supple :)  I've seen 
some pristine stuff the OO took off a seat and stored, as well.  And buy new 
panels. I passed up an NOS drivers side cab door panel for my 61 deluxe $30 
silly me.  Also seen NOS headliners in the pretty \X/\X/\X/\X/ box, but wrong 
year for me.
