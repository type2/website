I think the tight bushings are causing the wierdness. If you set the
shims and the toe-in according to the instructions in the Idiot Book,
then the alignment is done. The alignment shop won't be able to do
anything you haven't already done.

I'd keep on puming grease and see if things loosen up. I'd also be
working on Plan B in case the they don't. I wouldn't leave town in the
bus if the steering isn't right.
