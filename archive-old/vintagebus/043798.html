&gt;Excess fuel pressure.

...pushing down on me, pressing down on you, no man ask for...

Specs from the '63-'67 Bentley are...

1200    1500    engine
3600    3800    rpm
   2.8     2.8  psi (pressure with closed needle valve)
  31.7    42.3  pints/hr
  18.3    24.4  in^3/min

It also mentions a newer pump (Jan '63 and up) marked &quot;VW 3&quot; and 
rated at 5.25 gal/hour, 400 cc/min, 2.8 psi maximum pressure.

&gt;Any other suggestions?

Have you read http://wow.atlasta_dot_net/~mriluvu/oacdp/solex.html ?

If you still think it's too high, you can get a pressure regulator
to try and cut it down.  With everything right you &quot;shouldn't&quot; need
this but it might be something to try.

&gt;BTW, I noticed some needle valves are stamped 1.5, some 2.5, one I have
&gt;says 2.7; is this some sort of pressure ref?

From http://wow.atlasta_dot_net/~mriluvu/oacdp/solex/Page-07.jpg , &quot;the
size marked indicates the size of the orifice in the needle valve
through which the fuel flows&quot;.  Bentley says this is in mm, and
also notes that 1.5 needle valves were used on 28 PICT, 28 PICT-1,
and 30 PICT-1 on 1200 and 1500 through '67.

I hope this helps!

Matt Roberds
