Subject: Re: [VB] center brakelight /was: round to square regulator 

Hey Stan
The center brakelight was discontinued in mid 57 and the taillights were
changed then as well, to coincide to include brakelights. It happened over
a period of approximately 3 months (march, april, may) even though you can
find listings that call out a specific date - mostly in march or april. I
have seen original buses with and without the brakelight/taillight etc thru
those 3 months. Looks like Thoms diagram listing is now incorrect - he
changed it. It used to have an empty spot where the 56 thru mid 57 USA
diagram would go. Now i see 56- 61 USA, thats wrong. Did you give up on the
search thom?
should have:
55-56 non usa
55-56 usa
56-mid57 usa
56-mid57 non usa.

I do have a 56-mid57 usa diagram that is a supplement to the 55-56 diagram.
It simply shows only the new wiring added to US buses for bullets and dual
filaments taillights.

&gt;I had Thom post the round vs. square regulator question in an effort to
&gt;properly date the various  factory wiring diagrams. However, since then I
&gt;have signed up to the list and would actually rather know when (month and
&gt;year) the Type 2 switched from rear center mounted brake light to brake
&gt;lights in the two taillights. I think this will be a much more accurate
way
&gt;of identifying these particular wiring diagrams rather than round to
square
&gt;regulator.
&gt;
&gt;By the way, the actual diagrams I'm referring to, as labeled on the
&gt;vintagebus page are:
&gt;
&gt;1955-1956, from 3/55 Non-USA (round regulator, center mounted stop light)
&gt;1956-1961 Non-USA or USA (both have square regulator and stop lights in
&gt;taillights)
