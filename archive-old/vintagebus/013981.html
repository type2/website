Hello All,
 Got a few questions for yall...
First, Didnt a bus come with storage spot to keep the
churchkey in? Seems I remember seein one on a rusted
out westy.. lower left when seated in the drivers seat
if memory serves correctly... mabey a S/C didnt have
one?
 Second, does anyone know what went in the steering
colume bracket in the spot opposite of the ignition
switch? Mine has a clear plastic plug in it. 
 Lastly just want to thank the list for all the help
yall have given me. Never have I seen so much
knowledge, brotherhood, &amp; versitile opinions in one
place.... 
Thanks....

 Needing someone is like needing a parachute. If he isn't
there the first time, chances are you won't be needing him
again.
