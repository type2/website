&gt; lure of A/C and disc brakes has you driving a fiberglass highroof camper 
&gt;waiiit a minute. Isnt this what the 911 is for?:) ....david &lt;

LOL!!!  911 A/C work...  LOL!!!   I ripped the A/C out of mine after the
third time of pumping that expensive R-12 in there in a year!  Plus the A/C
suck in them when it does work anyway.  The 911 is notorious for having
inherent freon leaks.  Plus it is a Sunday driver/ garage queen anyway so
who need the A/C?  lower the windows and let the engine scream!

Thom I agree 100% with Kyle.  If there is a need for baywindow information
someone can start a baywindow_dot_com site.  I have maintained and driven a few
bays and they just are not that nice in my opinion, definitely not to be
considered &quot;vintage&quot; by any means.
