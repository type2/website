Everybody needs to read them, specifially the last sentence of this part
of the charter:

FRIDAY. TGIF is an institution that started on v_at_l, our motherlist. It's a

loose. Understand that Friday ends at midnight on that day, it does not
endure indefinitely. And, even on Friday, messages must have bus content.
