Subject: rubber snubber clearance?

Alright. I've got the rear transaxle all dialed-in in
DARTHVW. (completely stock, 67 with GRB's, stock
height, as far as I know)

So I look under there, and the two rear rubber
snubbers(?) (those black rubber snowman things
sticking up from the axle tubes) are almost touching
the metal dish above them. There is less than 1/4 inch
clearance between the top of the snubber and the metal
dish.

The bus looks stock height. Is that the way it is
supposed to be under there? This is in an empty bus
(even the gas tank is nearly empty)
please advise.

OnE more thing:
I put on four new BOGE shocks, advertised as &quot;OEM for
an original ride&quot; what is an original ride? spngy?
stiff? I wasn't even an embryo when my bus was made,
so it's not like I remember the ride.

Jason
67 deluxe &quot;DARTHVW&quot;
