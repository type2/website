Subject: Re: [VB] Belt slippage.

Thanks Eric, that makes perfect sense, good explanation.(I spoke with you at 
the Phoenix Bug-o-Rama #29 a few years ago).

This whole thing about belt slippage makes ask the question, &quot;what is the 
motor going to be used for?&quot;.  I have a 2017 in a '61 Westy w/trailer(loaded 
for camping), with the 3:88 FF and 205/75R/15 tires I cruise at 3000-3200 
RPM, 65ish MPH, the highest RPM I shift at is around 42-4300, normal on a 
level road is 3800ish.  Why need a bus motor that'll run 6000 RPM? I 
absolutely have no worries about belt slippage at my RPMs.

Just a reminder, do not over tighten the belt if you're using an
  aftermarket (including the Porsche) pulley(s) on top and an aluminum
 bottom.
  They can explode!  I set my belt tension very loose, with no ill effects
 from slippage.

 What makes the pulley fail when overtightened is the two pulley halves do
 not get to fully seat against eachother. This causes the pulley to do the
 &quot;tin can&quot; effect and start bending back and forth, round and round style 
until it breakes apart near the hub.
