Hey, I didnt criticize you. I just said when people hack things, they are 
hacking things, you must have taken it as an insult, why? all factory not 
endorsed coachbuilts could be considered hacked together too. But what you 
are making is something its not, you could buy a bus like your making, so 
your faking. Its like me making a barndoor. Hey, dont worry if it will be 
accepted, who cares what i think, there are lots of bus people on this list 
and I have very different feelings than most of them. Take it easy.

&lt;&lt; yeah i guess you are right if i had chopped a hundred,  one or even two 
thirty
 five years ago then sold it with my dealer name scrawled on it ,it would be
 acceptable. it might even be sought after . since sundials came that way from
 Hanover i guess it is a original vw then huh? oh wait a minute they didn't 
come
 from the factory like that somebody took there vision chopped some buses and
 made it happen. also i suppose all non factory endorsed coachbuilts and
 conversions are hack as well?besides in a community such as this is would be
 best to support and not criticize others ,as you neither know me ,my tastes
 ,collection, or things i have you may someday need &gt;&gt;
