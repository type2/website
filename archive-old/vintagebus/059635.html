I know this is a long shot, but I figured if anyone had a fix it would
be list members here. My friend just had his tranny rebuilt on his 67 3
months ago micro. Yesterday he was driving home from work and hit a pot
hole that was much larger than it looked. He said the left rear tire
dropped all the way in as he tried to avoid it and the edge of the hole
hit the underside of the bus. He got out and looked and didn't see any
damage except for some scrapes on the frame. Today he woke up to a
puddle of gl4. There is a hairline crack on the center section. Does
anybody here know of a way to patch the crack? He cant afford a parts
right now so we have to try to slow down or stop the leak for a while.
Amy one here have ideas on hairline crack repair? I was thinking JB Weld
once its cleaned up. Any ideas?
TJ
