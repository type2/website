OK, there are Brazilian and Mexican cases available, if you don't want to
use the rubber cam plug or spend 25 dollars to have the case grooved buy the
Mexican new case, still has the groove for the cam plug, but do not come
with any of the hardware in the case, so you need to also purchase a
hardware kit or rob all the studs off of another case, all the case halve
bolts are installed though, these cases were 50.00 dollars less the
Brazilian cases but due to the high demand for these the price did go up,
still cheaper then the Brazilian case though.

Jim,

I have been researching these cases too.  I talked with the guy's at Kymco
Motorsports about
this.  They said that the Brazillian cases use a glued in rubber plug
instead of the steel
grooved one.  They have Rimco bore the cases out for this.  I guess they
have had trouble with
the rubber type plug.

Hope that helped.

I am thinking of going the same route when i build my motor.  Can you let us
all know how the
rest of this case is?

Thanks

Matthew
