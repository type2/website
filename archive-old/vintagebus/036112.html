Message-ID: &lt;7bf5698.2443af34_at_aol_dot_com&gt;

hey for those of you who have wondered why I haven't responded to any emails
or posted anything to the list it's because I went to Kelly Park.

   I am beat as all get out as we left SanJose yesterday afternoon and got
back to oly about 6.30 (Duncan had to be at work at 8am today).  Only about
an 800 miles drive, but the details are kinda fuzzy.  Anyway, it was really
nice to take a road trip and I thought the show was great, in spite of it
being drizzly.   You know, the sunny day on Saturday was a bit much.
Squint squint.   Took the faded, somewhat rusty and battered 61 red/white non
sunroof deluxe and I got a lot of guff about the play in the steering (I
couldn't get the drag link off the day before leaving, I tried really hard
though).  I feel that the permanent slight lean to the right made up for it.
 Yeah right.  The bus ran great, with only a small problem.  Saw lots of
listees and people I see at VW shows and VW people I know from the bay
area/Santa Cruz at the show, and Thom's 55 with the nifty interior and nifty
tent.    Found some NOS barndoor slider window latches very reasonably priced
too.    Didn't find a steering lock.

Ran into the Silverton boys'  (from a bit south of Portland) caravan on the
way north,   as we swooped onto I - 5 from 505, they were on 5 N so I guess
they went through Sacamento, 4 splits, a nice early 60's bug and (!) a non VW
'supportvehicle'.   we stuck our arms out the windows and flapped up and down
(we're flying!!!!) .  They stopped at a rest area half an hour later, but
Saw another splitty (green/grey original paint 59-61 standard- nice bus) a
hour or two later  and flapped the arms again, and they did it back.
Practically rolled around laughing .  Anyway ,   think I'll post a trip
report later.    You can hear the amazing adventures in Grants' Pass.
