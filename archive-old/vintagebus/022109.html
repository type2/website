&gt;I'm still looking for an engine lid for my 59 bus. But which lid is the

&gt;factory in March of 59. So which one is the one? And does anyone have
&gt;one???? Also which apron is the right one? The one with the hole or no hole?
&gt;I'm still looking for both.

Jay,

Your engine lid should be the one with the bump for the license plate 
lamp.  They were the same from 1959 through early 1964.  Your rear apron 
should be the one without the hole for the crank start.  They were the 
same from mid-1959 through 1965.
