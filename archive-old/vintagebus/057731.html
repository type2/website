Subject: Re: Child Car Seats and Vintage Bus

The real problem is when they get big enough to be out of the small kid
seats and into a booster. We have found no good booster seats that will
work without having a shoulder restraint. If you are going to add belts
you might consider this now. I am hoping to add shoulder belts to the
crew cab this spring. My two year old is nice in safe in her little seat
but my 6 year old is exposed to way to much metal for my tastes with
only having the lap belt. Remember that there is a lot to where and how
you place the belts. The area they are attached to should be reinforced.
Do not attach them to the seat! There are small details to like I have
heard your shoulder mount should be above the shoulder or else it can
compress your spine in even the smallest accident. I drove around with
shoulder straps mounted to the bulkhead (about 12&quot; below my shoulder)
for 12 years in my 66, I am glad I was never hit. I think I am going to
go to a race shop and see if they will either do the install or give me
some good pointers on the where and how.
hope this helps,
Craig
