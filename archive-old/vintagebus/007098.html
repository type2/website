Subject: Re: [VB] importing goods to USA

They were probably asking for my benefit, that's pretty cool...

I called the USA border office today in Buffalo, NY and they said there is
no problem bringing across any car over 25 years old, you just have to pay a
duty fee of 4% of the first $1000, 2% of the next $1000, etc..  I stopped
listening after the 4% because no VW would cost more than $1000, that would
be just crazy, right?

Thanks to everyone who was doing some legwork for me!

Everett

Subject: [VB] importing goods to USA


I have been asked by a number of people in the last few days about importing
old
cars to USA from CANADA

I have no personal experience doing this,, but I do know bringing a 25yr old
Vw
Bus into CANADA is extremely easy,,

Mike Moore pointed me to this page which has a great deal of information on
everything,, not just cars
http://www.customs_dot_ustreas_dot_gov/impoexpo/impoexpo.htm

If anyone has personal experience with U.S. Customs at the CANADIAN
border,,especially with Vw's over 25yrs old, it would be nice to hear

Thanks
