Subject: Eriba! Transport company advice needed
Message-ID: &lt;18d28c38.248e5757_at_aol_dot_com&gt;

All,

Found an Eriba Puck trailer (finally) it near perfect condition that I am 
going to be purchasing soon.  I was going to try and retrieve it this weekend 
since I already had Thursday &amp; Friday scheduled off but reality set it when I 
started planning 3700 miles in 4 days...even in a Passat that is a lot of 
miles.

So, anyone had any real good or real bad experiences with a transport company 
they want to share?  Any cost effective carriers out there?

Thanks,
Dan
