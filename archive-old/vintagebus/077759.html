Subject: RE: [VB] Thermostats...

I am, and have always been, a thermostat advocate for street vehicles.
While the masses during the seventies and eighties were pulling there
thermostats, brackets, and flap hardware, I was collecting them.

To answer your question, the smaller number denotes the smaller engine,
i.e. 1200-1500. The 1600 came out with a thermostat that had a different
expansion rate because of the air flow around the head was altered with
the dual port design. You might notice that one thermostat looks like it
is made from thicker material. I have used both in the opposite
application successfully, so don't let that deter you. The thermostat
bolt is a standard 1 1/4&quot; 8mm, (forget the length mm here), with a flat
washer, not wavy. When I was down at the hardware store where I buy all
my metric stuff I picked up a dozen and threw them into my thermostat
bracket box. By the way, the thermostat bracket is the same for all
years.

Hi all,

Okay, I was going thru a box with a few old used, but good thermostats
for my fleet, and noticed a few slight differences.  Most of mine have a
range of degrees marked on them.  The two ranges I have are:  65 - 70
and 75 - 80.  I also have one with no markings at all.
Thanks, and stay warm everybody!
