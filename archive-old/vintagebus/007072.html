&gt;Question two: Maybe another stupid question, but what does the
acronym FLAPS stand for? (As in &quot;I visited my local FLAPS for a
govenor but couldn't find one.&quot;)  You might answer this question for
about 400 other people - or I might be the only one under a rock, I
don't know.  Answers highly appreciated!

YEAH! So glad you asked! I've been wondering for about 5 months now
too, so you're not alone! :-)
