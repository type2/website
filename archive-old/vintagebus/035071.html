&lt;&lt; Speaking of weird engine numbers ... I just noticed my engine that is now
 complete has one of those recycled numbers. Before you say &quot;yah yah heard
 that one already&quot;...the number is as follows.....
 B.
 thats it.
 VW recycle symbol then &quot;B&quot;. No, the rest is not ground off or altered. just
 forgot to stamp the rest i guess? MY 36 horse case is like &quot;recycle
  &gt;&gt;

I have seen that, both way.  sometime sthe Recycle VW and the number, and 
sometimes the Recycle VW and just the prefix,  well you still know which 
style of case it is
