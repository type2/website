Subject: Re: [VB] clunking from rear wheel/reduction box

&gt;.......... it also makes it
&gt; when driving normally.  It comes and goes and seems to increase with higher
&gt; temps but that is somewhat anectdotal.
&gt;   It sounds sort of like a bad bearing or a dull thumping/whirring and seems
&gt; to make the noise every wheel revoloution or every other whell revolution.
&gt;


E-brake lever arm thingy is loose &amp; hits against the brake drum?????  I had
this problema after replacing a wheel cylinder &amp; not reinstalling the
e-brake properly.
