Subject: brake hoses/61 update
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

Been working on the 61 to make it roadworthy.   It has tags now and is legal 
to drive around. Taller than the 65 with the big 15&quot; tires on it.  The brakes 
were acting funky. a couple drums got pretty warm after its first 4 mile test 
drive.  The left rear smelled bad.  :(   Pulled off a brake hose and it was 
clogged to where I could not blow through it, even though the brakes were 
bleedable. It got new ATE hoses about 6 years ago.  It had been sitting about 
2 years, FWIW.     So I replaced hoses again.   Evidently the life of new 
hoses can be shorter than I thought  :(  safety first, youse all.  Drives 
better with new hoses.  The old hoses looked okay on the outside no warts or 
cracks, the fluid never got dirty and gross.  But the inside is what matters. 
 Though I think the brake cables make have sticking issues.  Gonna go take a 
drum off and inspect.  

also removed the kick panels in order to install guage wiring and clean the 
fuse box.  Turned out I couldn't find my oil temp sender and the oil pressure 
sender was bad, so the guages are just decoration.   The right side taillight 
did not work until I cleaned where the wire went onto the fuseblock.  Then I 
reglued the original material to the hidden side of the panels where it came 
unglued around the edges so it would be tidier.   Insulated the nose with the 
shiny bubble wrap stuff., and put the kick panels back in.   Gotta plastic 
the doors and put the cab door panels on to make the cab tidy.   Then I'll 
put the drivers side inside handle on!  even vacuumed the floor to get the 
dirt and rust detritus off it.  The air vent fix did cut down on drafts and 
improve being able to operate the flap.   This drafty bus  with rocker rot 
and holes in front floor and mashed drivers dogleg does get warmer that the 
outside, soon will see if the insulation makes any difference.  Haven't put 
the floor mat (61 style) back in or the under pedal pan yet.  I do have the 
61 style brake cable end cover in the correct paint.  (Metal, snaps on over 
the brake lever, this year did not come with the rubber brake cable end boot) 
I cleaned and polished the insides of the cab doors so it would be tidy 
before attaching the door panels.  Looks nicer, with bright SWR and beige 
grey.  Polish smells good too.  Wiped the dash with a damp rag, it is 
gorgeous SWR with the pointy pod around the speedo.

need to find one of the clock hold down pieces that goes one each side of the 
clock and you turn the little gnurl screw to tighten it against the under 
side of the dash.  It has only one, and so the clock does not ground properly.

BTW, I think the 59 Rex hauled home is in better shape.
