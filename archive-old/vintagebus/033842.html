 OK, i have been tuning the H30/31 I RE installed in the bus, and have some
 more questions for the List...
 I HAD a 28Pict1 which I LOVED, but it began to leak too much air through
 the shaft. I had this same 30/31 in before, and was getting TEN mpg, so I
 yanked it; have cleaned and scrubbed it, jets are as follows:
 main 112.5
 air correction  130z
 30/31s have TWO extra jets, an idle and a pilot. They sit one behind the
 other on the right side, noone seems to know which is which, or what the
 pilot does. For now, the forward jet is 91.65, other one is 91.5.
 1600 SP, 009 for now, stock muffler. Fuel pump rod is SLIGHTLY below stock
 height to lower pressure a tad - recently done, as it was the first thing I
 thought of when I saw i was using too much fuel.
 
 Car runs OK (once I fixed a head intake leak), BUT pours fuel into the
 exhaust at idle, and gets 12 mpg. This is unacceptable. Esp. since my tires
 are 10% too small, so that mpg is 11.
 Lewis maintains that a 1600 shouldn't even MOVE on 112.5, that a 122.5 is
 better - I just see more gas being dumped.
 Now, VWs actually CRUISE on the idle circuit, so I would assume that too
 small a main would make it too lean at speed, but I drove it to 72 mph with
 no trouble, no overheating, no stumbling. Perhaps the 130 emulsion tube is
 masking that (spec should be a 140 emulsion... the higher the number, the
 more AIR the emulsion tube flows; this is the opposite of the main jet).
 
 I need to check the pump pressure this wekend... anyone running these carbs
 wanna report theit jet sizes/mpg?
  &gt;&gt;
I have been running this size carb on my bug for nearly 10 years 20-25mpg, 
and dunno the jets, whatever was in there (I bought it new).  I have 
occasionally run a 30/31 on my 65, and got 20-23 ish mpg.  You milage is so 
absolutely cr%p.  what did you get with the 28?  Do you have an intake leak 
anywhere?   some plug fall out?   hole in the manifold??    is the vertical 
air correction jet tightened down?
