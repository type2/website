Subject: Re: [VB] Re.Fuel petcock

Just out of curiousity, how much further does the reserve take you? Has
anyone tried to find out the limit? ;) C'mon guys, bring along a plastic
container of gas and give us the definitive answer!! I know on my BMW
motorcycle, when you switch to reserve, you'd BETTER start looking for the
next station as you have another 10 miles or so left.

&gt; Was written++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
&gt; i really want to go drive around now and &quot;run out&quot; of
&gt; gas, just so i can operate the petcock in a &quot;real
&gt; life&quot; situation.
&gt; +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
&gt; I did the same think when I fixed the Petcock on my 59
&gt; Single Cab. When my 59 finally ran out of gas, it was
&gt; very sudden with No Warning at all. Luckily, I was on
&gt; a country road going 45mph so the speed kept the
&gt; engine going long enough to allow the reserve gas to
&gt; get to the engine. Sure was fun...
&gt; There is something so antique feeling about the fuel
&gt; reserve system.
