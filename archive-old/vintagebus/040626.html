&gt; We have a locking one in stock right now for $346.50.  Non
&gt; locking ones are
&gt; $245.00 exchange.
&gt; Thank You!

There have been some incorrect splitty steering boxes floating around.  They
are apparantly specific to Brazilian busses and are not adaptable to US
versions without modification. Even a certain major mail-order VW parts
vendor in the U.S. has been shipping these unknowingly.  I too got burned at
one point, then later was offered the same boxes from two other wholesalers.
I'm sure you're safe with Bus Boys, since they know busses, but on this
particular item, a word of caution is in order if dealing with vendors who
are not bus specialists.
