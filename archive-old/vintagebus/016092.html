Well volks,

It looks like I'll be heading out around 1 or 2 am to
get to the Campbelltown, PA show by the time the
vendor area opens at 7 am tomorrow morning.  Not sure
what I'll be driving, but I will try to disply my
purple www.type2_dot_com sticker somewhere prominently! 
Rumor has it I may be in a green '75 RHD Aussie loaded
up with mucho parts.  If anyone wants me to look for
something in particular, please p-mail me off the list
and I'll keep an eye out for it.  I will try to post a
small trip report Sunday...

Paul
