I had a Che*y tech rep tell me that there is an ongoing problem with Chevron
(ironic I know).  I was having a check eng. light come on and they had to reset
it all the time.  The guy said stop using that brand of gas....the problem
stopped.  They have apparently traced quite a few emission equipment failures
to the gas.  Of course it wouldn't be the first time a dealer blamed
someone/thing else for a problem.
