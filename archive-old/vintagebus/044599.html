&lt;&lt; So the question:  What is the easiest way to lower the compression? &gt;&gt;
Hi Markus,
The best and quickest way to lower your compression ratio is to install shims
under the cylinders next to the case.  You can order these shims from several
engine rebuild shops in the USA.  The shims that are also available that go
between the cylinders and the heads seem to cause more problems with not
sealing than the other type.  You can also carbide bits to grind the sharp
edges in the heads into radiuses and get the individual head chambers to the
same cc on each head to both drop the compression ratio.  Turning the sharp
edges in the heads not only drops your CR, but rids the combustion chambers of
hot spots that will cause run on and detonation.  All in all the best thing
you can do is to remove the heads and figure out your CR.  Also what RPMs you
run the engine during hot weather can make a huge difference in not only how
your engine preforms, but how long it will last.  Eric &amp; Barb
