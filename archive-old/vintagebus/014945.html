Subject: Identification of bus, engine, etc.

Could someone please send me some information on identifying my bus more 
exactly. Where are the numbers and who can tell me what they mean. I think 
from the manual diagrams that I have a different engine than what was 
standard in 1966. My only clue is from the gas tank vapor system that didn't 
show up til after 1970. Otherwise it also has a aftermarket carb with a 
rectangular paper filter.
Could someone also tell me where my chasis number is. I've read the manual 
but never understood where they were talking about.

Thanks
Scott
