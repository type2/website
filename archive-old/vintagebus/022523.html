I have no idea.  It looks like a metallicy blue, which I don't think I've
ever seen in real life.  I think the color is due to the Ted Turner
colorization of the brochure.

&gt;Question about paint colors to Thom, bus related so I thought I should post

&gt;
&gt;Thom on you site in the Westfalia Camper restoration story you have a
&gt;beautiful bus pictured with a tent off the side, and some people, near a lake
&gt;I think.
&gt;
&gt;Anyway I was wondering about the paint colors of the bus in the picture...
&gt;are those original VW combination, and what are those colors. I am
thinking of
&gt;painting my bus similar colors.
&gt;
&gt;Thanks
