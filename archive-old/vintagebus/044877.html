Subject: Re: [VB] Fwd: Euro windshields explode.
To: BUSROCK_at_aol_dot_com, vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

European windshields are tempered like the side windows, 

they break into small pieces and make a big mess, 
you will often see piles of glass sitting on the side of the autobahn where 
the driver stopped and scooped out the glass.....

I had a bay window windshield explode one time in Austria, 
I was lucky and was not going that fast......

USA glass is laminated, the plastic laminate between the 2 pieces of glass 
keeps most of the pieces from getting in the car, 

I  think the USA glass must say AS-2 on it to be legal.......
