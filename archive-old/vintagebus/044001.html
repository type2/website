Speed kills.....not anything new to a seasoned VW nut.
But for most...thinking about speeds above 47 or even 57 possibly sounding
a death knell to their Bus is hard to swallow these days.
More horsepower and re-configured gear ratios are slowly filling the void,
to some degree it seems to me anyway.
Obviously, based on the tire threads that persist to crop up, tires too.
Personally (and Clara can relate to this I'm sure) with the mountain
passes and multitude of large (steep) hills here in the northwest, I like
the idea of the reduction boxes in place and the 3.8 R&amp;P trannyand a good
solid 1600.  I can live with 60mph and most other drivers on the hiways
will put up with that too.  But they tend to get a bit raged with a Bus
doing 47.  I don't think I would drive a vehicle that maxes out at that
speed other than to car shows nearby and Sunday drives.  Probably for the
same reason my friend only drives his '05 Ford touring on those occasions.
It'll do 35 with the Ruxtell 2 speed rear.
Just a ramble from Moi
