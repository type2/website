O.K. list, here's the situation.  I have a generator fuel pump that seems to
be sealed, no way to open it.  I have suddenly developed fuel delivery
problems.  No fuel for a while and then fuel again later.  I have an in-line
filter so I can see what is going on.  Is there any way to open this pump up
and clean it out?  I'm sure that there is some type of blockage that comes
and goes in there.
