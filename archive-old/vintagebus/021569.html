&gt;&gt;My understanding is that the color of the wool fabric is notindicative of
the year, but of the exterior color of the bus.  Dove Blue bus =
yellow/black.

I believe the early color choices were dictated by fabric availability.  It
is likely that some exterior/interior color combinations are more common
but I have reason to believe no specific exterior/interior &quot;color charts&quot;
ever existed in the SO-23 - SO-35 era.  (My guess is that large VWoA
purchases beginning in 1963(?) may changed things.  Todd may know).

My in-laws were the original owners of my Dove Blue S0-34 camper.  They were
living in Holland when they ordered it from the local Pon's dealership. They
asked specifically about interior color options.  They considered the three
color Westy plaids awful with the Orange/Yellow/Rust plaid being especially
hideous. They wanted to make sure they avoided that color combination.  

They were not able to specify the interior color. The Pon's dealer helped to
convince them it was reasonable to assume a Dove Blue bus would arrive with
a Blue/Green interior.  They were told there was nothing to worry about.

When the car arrived it had the Orange/Yellow/Rust plaid interior.  My
in-laws refused to pick up the car and the dealership tried to fix the
problem.  Calls were made and the final response was &quot;You get what you get&quot;
(or the equivalent in German or Dutch).  They were never sure if the
response was from Pon's or the Westfalia Factory.

The dealership claimed to have made an attempt to swap interiors and found
only Orange/Yellow/Rust plaid interiors were available.  

My in-laws eventually picked up the car.  They assumed they would grow to
accept the plaid.  They never did.  I made the mistake of asking why they
ordered the bus with that ugly plaid which brought up old wounds but
provoked a long discussion about the early history of the bus.  I have no
doubt they hate the color of the plaid and did everything possible to avoid
buying a camper with the Orange/Yellow/Rust plaid fabric.  

There are other examples of early Westy fabric colors being dictated by what
is available.  Larry and Eli's SO-34 has two variations of the
Orange/Yellow/Rust plaid.  They found the second variation hidden under the
first.  It's pretty clear the Westy factory ran out of one version of the
fabric. When the plaids didn't come close to matching, they simply
upholstered over the pieces they had already finished with the new, slightly
different fabric.
