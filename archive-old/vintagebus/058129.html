Subject: T1 Rev limiting rotors FOUND!

For all you T1 lead foots:

4500RPM cut out.  Limited supply.

Contact this man:
Gilbert S. Chan
gschan_at_email_dot_com        
Manila, Philippines

Ships from the Philippines.  But payment is sent to his brother in El
Segundo, CA.

Kind of odd but it works :)  Seems like a really nice fellow.

For T4 motors John at aircooled_dot_net carries a full line of 5400RPM and up.
