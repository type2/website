&gt; &gt;There was a post yesterday, 4/19, referencing some transaxle/transmission
&gt; &gt;documentation complete with pictures.  Unfortunately I lost the link and
&gt; &gt;the note and have not been able to search it out.
&gt;
&gt; For recent stuff, the last 1000 posts to VintageBus are always available
&gt; at http://www.type2_dot_com/vintagebusreflect .

Hi Gang,

I'm lost on this one.
no trace in the archives.
SH, are you sure this was the list you were remembering
and not RAMVA or vintagVW?

I sent a web link to Andrew as a contribution to the doc project
It sounds kind of like what you are getting at...
It was a manual scan w/ special tool fab and beef mods, stuff like that.
The quality was something like the English &quot;No publisher name&quot;
manual. Defiantly a funky DIY feel to it.
( snide remarks about that last observation expected.)
flame shields up! =)
But the link went 404 shortly afterwards.
I wished it had stuck around long enough for me to download it completely.
Any notions or deja vu?
Aloha
Ken Alford
