Subject: Re: [VB] Kudos to the List

Please, don't start with that forum.  I've been reading it pretty regularly
for the past couple years, lately i've been horrified about how childish the
people were being.  After all the whining everybody is doing since Everett
changed the rules, I'm just done with it

&gt; This isn't really anything other than A thank you to
&gt; all listees for maintaining a common sense of decency,
&gt; no matter what the topic.
&gt;  You should see what is happening on the Samba_dot_com in
&gt; the Rants and Raves forums. It's really sad.
