Subject: Fuel Smell
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

I am running a 1600 DP with a 009 and a 30/3 carb. 
The engine runs perfect and gets good mileage on my
daily 25 mile (each way) daily commute.   My problem
is, when I pull into my garage at night and close the
door I get a pretty evident fuel smell.  This is
usually only for 15 minutes or so and if I leave the
garage door open its ok.  I have checked all the
usual/easy spots.  No fuel line leaks are found and
the accelerator cable travels freely to let the
manifold/choke (whatever you call it) to close
completely.

Any ideas?

Thanks
