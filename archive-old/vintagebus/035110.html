 Ted,
 Thanks for the response, but this isn't the style of
 shift  rods and couplers with the 2 set screws. On my
 truck, the front, shorter shift rod fits over the rear
 shift rod, and a short steel collar with one screw
 goes over the joint.  My problem is that where the two
 rods overlap, they fit so tight I (so far) can't pull
 them apart.  The joint is less than 1&quot; from the heater
 pipe (actually has rubbed on the insulation when
 shifting), so there is not much space to work.
 Thanks.
 
 Jim

I have used heat on there, not worried about the heater tube.  my torch did 
not burn the insulation.    but first have you been soaking it w/ penetrating 
oil.   the rear rod is solid on you I believe, and easily takes vise grips. 
while the front is hollow.

you just got to get it to do the twist.
