If you must sandblast, then use the siphon feed only.  Pressurized blasting
does warp sheetmetal bar none.  I'd opt for a media blasting if I were you -
walnut shells, plastic beads, glass spheres, anything but sand if you can
help it.  Take it easy when you blast and only hold the nozzle as close as
you need to do the job.  Use proper ventilation as well - can't stress that
enough - your life depends on it.
