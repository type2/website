Subject: Re: Back by popular demand - Alan Schofield repair panels

I'm interested in two of the replacement cargo door bottom framing pieces
(not the outer skin),which Alan shows as part #10 in his early Type 2
diagram and listing. I haven't seen them listed anywhere else. Please let me
know the price and details by direct e-mail.

Given the recent discussion about quality shortcomings in some replacement
sheet metal parts, does anyone have favorable or unfavorable experience with
Alan's pieces?

&gt; I'll be importing at least one shipment of panels from Mr. Schofield in
&gt; England, and if it works out, I'll be the new US importer.  If anyone
wants
&gt; something, drop me a line, and I'll make sure it gets included.
&gt; If you want to see what's available, you can check out Alan's site at
&gt; www_dot_ahschofield_dot_co_dot_uk.
