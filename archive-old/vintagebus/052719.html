Subject: Re: [VB] 15&quot; tires on '66 Westi ?

Oh no the 15&quot; tire thread again.....I love it.

Not sure about their LT tires, but if they are anything like the P700's I have
on my VR6 Jetta, they should be good!  I've got close to 70K on my P700's and
still have a 1/4 inch of tread left.  Great handling though they are getting a
bit long in the tooth.  The kicker is that these things were less than 50 bucks
a piece.

Just my experience with Perelli.

Steve
