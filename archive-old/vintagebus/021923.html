&lt;&lt; Is this correct / normal or are they all supposed to be one way or the 
 other and not the mix of the two styles?&gt;&gt;
Hi Dan,
The change from the crows foot to the smooth lug bolt area rims was certainly 
a change in production tooling and not in fit to the bus.  The same happened 
with the rear 1962-67 tail lights lenses.  When the bigger tail lights came 
out the mold was embossed with 62 on it.  Then in 1966 the mold was either 
redone or replaced and the number 66 was placed on the lenses.  Either or 
both will work.  Though we have not seen a mold mix of tail light lenses on a 
low mileage 1966 or 1967 bus.  It would be very interesting to see the front 
ID plate numbers and if you can find the previous owner/s to see how original 
it is.  
 
&lt;&lt; Also, what is the stock tires size / height for a '58?  Now that I have 
the right rims I want to put the right size tire on so the speedo reads 
correctly. &gt;&gt;
According to our VW shop manual for pre-1968 bus they should have a Dynamic 
rolling radius of 328mm, or 12.9&quot; (A diamater of 656mm, or 25.8&quot;).  This was 
a bias tire size of 6.40-15.  We have found some old original tires measuring 
of the designation being 27&quot; in dia. and our two main driver buses seem to 
read speedo proper with 25&quot; dia. tires.  If you decide against using the bias 
tire you might want to check out a LT or P205/75R15 size radial and make sure 
it has a stiffer sidewall for better cross wind and semi passing you 
handling.  Also ask for the narrowest profile as possible of this size.
