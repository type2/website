Subject: Re:[VB] RPM Specs

I just finished a 3,400 mile trip from Dallas to Stockton and back at
3800-3900 rpm most of the way( when the hills would let me ) and it was
alright. I got about 23 mpg which was a couple of miles to the gallon
worse than when we went up to west virginia during the summer at 55.
