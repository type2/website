Hi All,

It's been awhile since an update, mainly because there is not much to
report!  The white dried out paint is getting slowly scraped off prior to
an overall sanding back down the dove blue.  It's definitely a long term
project with the time demands I have had lately with 2 small boys and a
new job.  Here's the pics from last Spring:

(thanks again Josh in OK)
