Hey, I have this spare 67 12V wiper motor that I don't need (my bus is a
61). I don't know if it works or not, and I don't want to put it up for
sale if it doesn't work. is there any way to see if it'll work just by
using some jumpers or something and a 12V battery? If there is, what are
the contact numbers that I will have to jump? I don't have a spare switch,
just the motor. Also, if it does work, what's the normal going price for a
good 67 12V motor? thanks in advance for any replies.

yes,    attache the ground side to ground on the motor housing,  and use the 
hot wire to activate it.   Offhand dont know which terminal does what, but if 
functional,  one will make it go fast, one slow,   and one return it to the 
park position.   You can find out easily.  :)
