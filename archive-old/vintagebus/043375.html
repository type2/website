&gt;Aftermarket crimp connectors are junk without being soldered/heat
&gt;shrinked.

I have to disagree with this blanket statement.  *Some* crimp
connectors are junk, true, but not all.  It also has a lot to do
with the way you crimp them.

I find that 3M connectors are generally of good quality, but can
be kind of expensive.  The quality of the small quantity packs
that you can get at your FLAPS varies greatly.  It's not a 100%
guarantee, but if you look at a ring terminal and see the manufacturers'
mark/initials and the stud size stamped in, it's more likely
to be a better quality terminal.

One kind of terminal I will NOT use is those &quot;tap-in&quot; guillotine
connectors.  There is not very much metal-to-metal contact in them,
and 3M only recommends them for 10 amps max.  These things just
seem to develop flaky connections after a relatively short period
of time.

Most cheap crimping pliers have jaws that look like this: ()  Even
the ones in the Bentley VW manual have these kind of jaws.  The
kind I prefer have a raised bump in one side of the jaws, something
like this: ({  Also, you should generally put two crimps per wire -
one to crimp the metal sleeve over the stripped conductor, and
another to crip the connector insulation over the whole wire.
If you do this, the connection will usually withstand a fairly
vigorous &quot;pull test&quot;.  When using ({ pliers, you have to make sure
that the { side is *not* pointing at the seam of the tube that
is crimped onto the wire.  In other words, it should look
roughly like: } C ) where } and ) are the plier jaws and C is
the tube of the connector.

Other wiring notes...

When using a butt connector, I like to wrap it with electrical tape
after it has been crimped and pull-tested.  If you crimp it hard
with pliers with the ({ jaws, you probably will expose some of the
metal of the tube.

If you have to splice several wires in a bundle, don't cut them
off all at the same place, if possible.  Cut one off, then move
along an inch or two and cut the next one, and so on.  This way,
you don't have a huge wad of splices all at the same point.

Leave some slack in the wires.  Not an extra foot of coiled-up wire,
but enough that you can cut off the connector and replace it, or
remove the item for servicing.

For bigger copper terminals (8-4 gauge), I like to crimp them a bit 
with the pliers, and then finish by hammering the copper barrel flat
onto the wire with a hammer.  Then I tape everything but the ring.

I have developed these ideas/techniques from installing car stereos
for myself and friends, working on my cars, and about a 1.5-year
stint at the local volunteer fire department installing and fixing
radios, lights, sirens, pumps, etc.  As always YMMV.
