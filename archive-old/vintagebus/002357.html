Methinks I'm going to have to call it good.  Done.

Don't link to page seven from page ten....Ronnie noticed a problem doing it
that way...link to each page sequentially:  That is, as you get to the
bottom of each page, you'll notice a &quot;Next page:&quot;  and a link...that's your
reward for making it through each one.  Another one.  There are ten in
all...and two &quot;ancillary&quot; pages.  There may be videos (short
snippets)....I'll post links or pmail them to interested parties.  I'll let
you know when they're presentable.

These pages are best viewed with browser frames closed....I haven't figured
out the locked formatting yet....so if the screen gets smaller, the 'puter
reformats my text and pics!

I hope y'all get a kick out of this...  www.sonic_dot_net/~mizamook/Shasta1.htm
