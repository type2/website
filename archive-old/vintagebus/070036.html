  Thats why the big boy engine builders put squirters in their engines, to
squirt oil into the back of the pistons.

&gt;Note
&gt;that there is nothing mentioned about oil. I
&gt;think that the cooling of the oil is to prevent
&gt;it's breakdown and provide lubrication, and not
&gt;to directly cool the engine, but I could be wrong.

&gt;... What is the heat path
&gt;to the oil?

nope, exactly right. the heat path is some from friction, more from 
the oil that washes the cylinder walls and rocker areas, but mostly 
due to convection to the case from the heads/cylinders.
cooling the oil will help keep it from thinning, but not correct the 
original problem, which is too much heat stored in the head/cylinders.

i'd like to hear from those running extra oil coolers and see how 
often they change valves or replace pistons. i'm guessing they do it 
a bit more frequently than normal (flame suit on!) despite the 
cooler.  the extra heat exchangers may help the oil  cooling the 
cylinder walls and back of the piston shed just enough heat  to keep 
many engines JUST this side of the high-wear heat zone, but i imagine 
there is a pretty quick crossover point........


&gt;
&gt;&quot;In small engine repair it states 1/3 heat is
&gt;conducted through cylinder walls, 1/3 for power
&gt;in the cylinder, 1/3 escapes in exhaust.&quot;
