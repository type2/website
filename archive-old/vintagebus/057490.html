Subject: Re: [VB] Re: [BSKA] Tank size - 10 Gallon?

The only way I know to check how many gallons is to
have one of the Texas listees lone us their &quot;10
gallon&quot; hat, fill it up, pour in tank, if it fills the
tank then, there you have it, a 10 gallon tank !!!

&gt; 
&gt;     Anyone know what size tank is standard equipment
&gt; in a '58 single cab? The PO of mine said he put in a
&gt; larger tank and I was thinking Bay tanks were 15
&gt; gallons.  I ran out of gas the other day and when I
&gt; filled up I only could put in 15.  Didn't put in
&gt; that much from the gas can.  Anyone know?
