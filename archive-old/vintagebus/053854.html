Subject: 5 more things I want to share

6)  When I assembled the engine and put it in, the engine started right
up, ran for 5 min. and then started to make bad ticking noises, I re-did
the valves (#1 intake and #2 exhaust were loose) and started it up again,
and it did the same thing and the same valves were loose, so I did it
again and then it worked fine.  I believe something was seating itself and
it could go all the way back to the cam...as Spock would say, &quot;the
possibilities are endless.&quot;

7)  Ronnie warned me about the pin head ball bearing in the Kadrons and I
lost one anyway, it is not hard to do and your car won't run right without
it.  I found out the reason #1 and #2 were not firing, there was a small
leak on the brazen weld of the equalizer tubes.  This leak was so well
hidden that I would have never found out the problem if I didn't take the
intake manifolds off and filled them with water from the hose with
stoppers on on the openings.

8)  As a homebrew store owner, I found lots of things I sell in my store
are very useful in restoring a VW, in particular are the solid rubber
stoppers where you can plug any hole and clean around it with water and
degreaser quite easily (heater mufflers incl.)  Carboy brushes and
dip tube brushes for cleaning and painting (put a sock over the end and
dip it in paint) out axle tubes, heater piping, metal gas lines...Visit
your local homebrew store or e-mail me if you need these.

9)  The job does not get down by wishing it gets done, you gotta do it and
when it starts kicking your ass, walk away and look at all your tools for
a better one to use, ask friends to help you hold something in place while
you work on it, most will gladly help.

10)  Wear thin mechanics gloves, you can gash up your hands quite easily
working on VW's, the first time really does not hurt all that bad, when
you re-injure yourself in the same place it hurts worse, but the 5th time
you scream agony.6

Best,
