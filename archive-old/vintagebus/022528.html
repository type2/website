Subject: Cable operated brakes on early busses ?

Here is one for the collective wisdom of this list:

The very first Beetles produced had, like the war-time VWs, both Beetles,
Kubelwagens and Schwimmwagens, brakes that were cable operated; no hydraulics.

This went on, for Standard Beetles, until 1961.

Question: Were the Type 2 ever produced with cable brakes, or did they have
hydraulics from the beginning ?
