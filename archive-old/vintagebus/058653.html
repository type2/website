Subject: Re: [VB] chrome bumpers

Rick,

I believe I saw the guy who runs ISP West Restorations selling a set on eBay 
a few weeks ago.  Try him at:

Good Luck,

I know I have sent this out before with very little feed back so I am trying
again.  I need a set of chrome bumpers for a 1959 panel van.  The can 
already
be done, be new,  be old,  or being dipped, I can take care of the shipping.
If you know some one that has a set or has had a set done please let me 
know.
  I need them ASAP.
Increase the Peace
Rick
