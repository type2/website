Hey Volks

I just returned to Manitoba after spending a month on the west coast
working in the bush - im going thru all of that email :) - kinda fun - i
really missed the list

anyway - i found a book that i thought was  for notch backs - but it
appears not - can anyone tell me about 411's - that book i found says:

Workshop Manual for Volkswagen 411 and 411 LE 1968-72

So what were these things -

jdd 60 std

ps - sorry for the non-bus content - but i couldnt wait till friday as
im heading back to BC soon :)
