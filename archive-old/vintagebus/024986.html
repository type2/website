  What color would be best with a white-over-red combo?  The original

&gt; suggestions?

Hey, NQ,

I would suggest painting the bus first, installing the trim, then use
something put over or wedged into the slots that hold the rubber to see
which color looks better. This way you can test the color before you
order the trim. Maybe try colored masking or duct tape, or even colored
paper cut thin to test which looks best to your eye.

I want my bus to be white over sealing wax red.  Well actually
&gt; white over Indian Red.  I have a $164 gallon can of paint (PPG) sitting here
&gt; that was meant for my 74 Super.  That's right, it's the same red that Super
&gt; Beetles were painted with in 1974.  So what the hell - I'll use it.

Hey, why not. It's cool to be a color purist, but you're the one it has
to look good for. Your bus will feel happy and protected in that nice
blanket of PPG.

I was quite surprised when I discussed
&gt; the issue with my workmates (of whom some are vintage Chevy and Ford people)
&gt; and without any prompting on my part, they unanimously agreed that I should
&gt; keep the bus 6v.  At that point, I thought if even they could see the
&gt; greatness of leaving everything 6v, then by god I'm going to leave it alone.

No real reason to convert unless, like myself, you drive it in real cold
weather and want to be able to jump start it real easily.

Good Luck!!

Dave
