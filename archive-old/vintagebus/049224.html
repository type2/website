Karl and I will leave sometime Friday morning from Fresno and head south on 99, east on 58 (Note to self: stop in Hinkley and fill water tank) to Barstow, then 40 to the LHC turnoff. If we can see our shadows and can't see our breath, we'll stop and get ice and beer at that turn off place. Look for the goat-vomit-green bay Westy, we'll monitor channel 2 FRS. If anybody wants to tag or draft along at 75 mph let me know.  

Ronnie: Water-Sprinkler Nate can't go, I'm delivering his raffle contributions. 

 -Harry in Fresno
