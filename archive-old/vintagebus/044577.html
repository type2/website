 Okay... will a late bus Eberspacher BN4, or any late bus gas heater for that 
 matter, be readily installable on an early bus?  Are modifications to 
 ducting required?  Is this such a pain that it isn't worth the effort and I 
 should just watch for a good early model heater?
  &gt;&gt;

I think it can, but I have not done it yet.  I hope to get one (or both ) of 
these BN-4s working, and then I can install it in a bus.
