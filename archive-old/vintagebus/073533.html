passenger side axle tube slipped right off, but the driver side was tight and 
I had to give the RGB a few taps with the 2lb happer to coax them off. Seems 
like the upper inner bearing is tighter on the axle on that side?
.....
well,should be the same, but sometimes things happen

===============================

&gt;after that the axles pull right out. They looked very good on the shovel 
end, no pitting or scratching.
..........
excellent

-----------------------
What is the name of the Gear/Carrier that the fulcrum plates ride in? The one 
that engages the spider gears in the trans.
...............
crown gear

--------------------------

Unbolted the bus nosecone from my old trans and spent about 1/2 hour cleaning 
the funk off it with simple green and a wire brush. Came out shiny and nice, 
regreased the hockey stick just cause it seemed like the thing to do. I think 
I will have to take the nosecone back off to install my new front trans 
mount's though as I don't think you can get it on with the nosecone bolted up.
................
get a new nose cone seal, goes at the end wher ehe hockey stick pokes out to 
keep oil from oozing out there.  Think you can install front mount with nose 
cone on.

==================
Nosecone/Gear selection question:

It occured to me as we were bolting on the nosecone that I would want to 
coordinate the gears that the bus thinks it's in with the gear the trans is 
actually in. Not having a good manual, I decided that if I pulled the sliders back 
and forth until the hockey stick could access any of them, that that would 
probably be neutral, correct?
. ..........
If you can slide the hockey stick in/out it's in neutral.  was told it's not 
good to change gears on a rebuildt tranny till it has had an engine hooked up 
running in neutral for 5 mins (urban legend?)

====================================
When in neutral, should spinning one axle in one direction force the other 
side axle to spin the other way?  My assistant said this was correct and that 
the differential fixes all this apparent craziness? True?
I don't get differential.
...................
don't worry about it

==============================
There were three paper gaskets stacked on my old trans where the axle tube 
retaining ring bolted on so I went with three also from my new kit. The axles 
fall under their own weight fairly quickly, but not haphazardly
...................
as long as you felt slight friction when it was falling, it is fine

============================

We stopped here as I need new gaskets for the RGB's, boots for the axles and 
new front trans mount.
....................

I make RGBox gaskets by tracing the outer housing on a paper grocery bag, 
using scissors and hole punch.  (pay $5 a piece my #ss)

The Febi bilstein brand axle boots ar excellent quality.   better than VW.
