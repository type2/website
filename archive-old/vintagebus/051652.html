&lt;&lt;   There new aluminum frames are as close to OG as I have seen (better then
 there steel). I need to get a set for me and start working on some aluminum
 OG style hindges that can be spot welded on. &gt;&gt;

When I visited CE back in September he showed me the prototypes.....
he felt the steel hindges were stronger than anything he could buy in 
aluminum,
plus he figured most were going to be painted anyway .
All the stuff I saw at his shop was top notch.......

plus you end up driving  by Stonehenge to get there........suprised me ! 
I thought Stonehenge was 50 miles north of there !  
and  out his back fence you can see an old fort at the top of the hill....

never know what you will  come across.......
