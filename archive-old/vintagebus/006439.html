Think of it as the &quot;poor man's o-ringed case&quot;...
It's good (I'm told) for older cases where the sealing surfaces may not be
as pristine as they were when new... like you get a case that the DPO
separated in the alleged &quot;rebuild&quot; with a knife blade, screwdriver, etc....
Only silk can be used... it &quot;smooshes&quot; just right, where regular thread
would resist doing so and probably do more harm to the surface.
When the &quot;thread&quot;  :)  started (a while back...), someone (maybe rsh...)
added that the tranny builder at the vw dealer used the silk thread trick on
all the trannies he built... the older split case ones that is...

&gt;I musta misted the previous posts: what's the purpose of putting silk in
there?
