Subject: Re: [VB] Now what?!?  69 bus tire pressures

&gt; &gt; In a message dated 8/14/2001 12:20:22 PM Pacific Daylight Time,
&gt; &gt; docric_at_preferred_dot_com writes:   &lt;&lt; They say  65 pounds maximum pressure,
and
&gt; &gt; that is what they put in them, but what pressures should I run? &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Hi Ric,
&gt; &gt; Best to run the 65 pounds pressure!  - very true^

The tires you have are D rated which means that they have an 8 ply
construction. You should definatly run them at 59 to the max of 65. Any more
and the center line will bald, and any less and the edges will bald and this
is a fact. The tires were designed to have this higher psi in them. The old
manual or shop psi ratings for the bus tires dont apply in the least because
the tires are completly different.

I hope I helped you with you tire pressure problem

adam

&gt;
&gt; I disagree.  If you run that much pressure the centers of the tires wear
prematurely.  I found this out by running 50PSI in my rear tires on
&gt; my '71 when 37-40 was the recommendation.  The centerline tread was bald
while the edge still had 3/16 or more tread depth.  This
&gt; represents a major loss of tread life.  You will also feel every pebble
and paint stripe on the road, which isn't good for the bus either.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; The tires you are using were not really
&gt; &gt; designed for VW bus use in mind and thusly the old fashioned VW pressure
&gt; &gt; levels could result in tire seperation.
&gt;
&gt; The old VW bias ply pressures do not apply, but the radial tire pressure
specifications do.  The tire size is the same.  For splits, the
&gt; pressures specified for early Bays are probably a bit high due to the
lighter weight of the splits, but they will be much closer to the
&gt; ballpark than the max pressure on the tire.
&gt;
&gt; &gt;  Which is what Firestone is claiming
&gt; &gt; about Fords recommended lower pressure cushier/softer riding tire
pressure
&gt; &gt; levels.
&gt;
&gt; No, in the Ford/Firestone case, Ford's recommended pressures were
ridiculously low, on the order of 25PSI.  VW's pressure specs for
&gt; radial tires are much more realistic.  The cause of tread separation (way
oversimplified) is excessive tread deflection.  The maximum
&gt; pressure printed on the tire is sufficient to limit tread deflection at
the maximum load specified on the tire.  D-rated tires will handle much
&gt; more load than they will ever experience on a bus, so the pressure may be
safely reduced without causing excessive deflection.
&gt;
&gt; Tire manufacturers publish charts that specify the optimum pressure for
various loads.  Savvy tire dealers will have these, but such dealers
&gt; are few and far between.  You need to have the actual load on each tire to
use these charts, since the load will be different for front and
&gt; back tires.  I have a feeling that the tire manufacturers specs will be
very close to VW's recommendations anyway.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; Plus with higher pressure and stiffer tires you will have better
&gt; &gt; handling, especially in cross winds and/or when a semi passes you will
not
&gt; &gt; automaticly change lanes inadvertantly!
&gt;
&gt; I really haven't noticed any difference in handling with a 10PSI reduction
in pressure.  The stiffness of the thicker sidewalls, not the
&gt; pressure, is the stabilizing feature to the C- or D- range tires.
