Subject: Re: [VB] not a public debate room!!!!!

I disagree. We need to spread the word about what is
REALLY going on. If the show was cancelled it would
send a VERY strong message to VW about what they are
up to. I have dealt with a promoter one on one and was
left nowhere! I am one voice that counts but a group
will get more attention.
I would be interested to know how many present VW
owners had owned VW before they purchased their new
VW. People are loyal to makes but it seems to me that
VW owners are very loyal, or they used to be. 
 I have owned a lot of VW's myself, even a water
cooled, but I won't buy a new one. I'll stick with my
Westy and pass on any event that has VWOA sponsorship.

&gt; Bashing and promoting are things you do at the shows
&gt; face to face and 
&gt; not on this mailer.  I have been to shows all over
&gt; the world and have voiced 
&gt; my opinions with the promoters in PRIVATE.  lets
&gt; keep it that way guys and 
&gt; gals. I have no problem when a business is praised
&gt; or objected to on orders 
&gt; or practices, but that to can be dealt with on
&gt; another wave length.  It is 
&gt; alright to notify people of a show date and some
&gt; details but re-direction to 
&gt; a site should be included.  I hope everyone has a
&gt; great summer to look 
&gt; forward to, but if we can't as a tight community get
&gt; along amongst ourselves, 
&gt; just imagine being on the outside looking in. Happy
&gt; motoring.........
