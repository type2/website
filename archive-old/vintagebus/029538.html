&gt; Does anyone have any tips on forcing the vent window glass back into the

&gt;
&gt; I have struggled for 2 days with no luck. I even lubed everything up with
&gt; white grease and still can't get the glass back into the frames.

I too had the same problem.  I'm currently driving without them.  During one of
my many recent windy drives, I hit upon the idea to soak the seal in boiling
water for a few minutes to soften it up.  Then using gloves, start working it
into place.

If you get there before me, let me know how it works
