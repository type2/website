Remember about a week ago I was bitching about how my bus wasn't always
starting and I couldn't fidgure it out... Well a couple of you guys told me
to get a starter relay because It sounded like I was loosing power between
the switch and the starter.
-I looked into it and finally decided that It was worth a shot. I Went to
the local shop and they happened to have a couple there so I picked one up,
and although it was quite rainy outside I sacrificed my good health in the
name of my bus (once again) and basically just plugged the relay in between
the starter and the battery. Believe it or not it fired right up, I turned
it off thinking that it was just teasing me then fired it up again, sure
enough, 2 times in a row, then 3, 4... Well since then no problems... Its
really a great Idea and it seems to me that VW should have had theese
little buggers stock because it actually seems to fire up better and faster
than before.

Overall opinion, If your type2 dosent have one its probably a good idea to
put one in anyway.

And a big thankyou to the folks who first told me about it!
