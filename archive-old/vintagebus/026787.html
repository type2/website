Subject: bentley manual

does anyone have a Bentley manual for a 63?  I don't think it would be
just for 63.  maybe 55-63 or something?
Either way, I could really use one as I'll be going hardcore on this
rustoration as soon as my welding is done.
I would either buy it or trade something for it...just let me know.
thanks!
