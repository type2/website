Subject:  RE:  flamin' listees


&gt; This is a little crazy for just being vocal on a VW mailing list.
&gt; 
&gt; Who really cares if the bus owners are hippies or not these days?  We
&gt; utilize this list for fun, information, and friendship.  What I consider
&gt; part of the vintage bus ownership experience.  Maybe I am naive to think
&gt; this way?
&gt; 
&gt; Personally I am very fiscally conservative with an overall libertarian
&gt; view.  I also support social freedoms, but do not agree with most of the
&gt; activities.  Basically you should have the freedom of choices, although
&gt; some are much more correct than others :)  The only thing I do not like at
&gt; all is abortion, adoption is an alternative.  Oh yah I also support all
&gt; the items in the Bill of Rights, including the 2nd amendment.
&gt; 
&gt; Does the above description make me a hippie?  I do not know.  Does it
&gt; matter... No.
&gt; 
&gt; I like vintage nazi busses for some reasons and I like the hippie Discover
&gt; card style busses too... Yah, even the Cal Look busses.  It is one big
&gt; happy family :)
&gt;     
&gt; To summarize... BE KIND!...  Now I have to get back to working hard to
&gt; support the millions of people on Welfare with nicer TVs than me!
