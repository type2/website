Hey-

I too just got my bench seat cover(grey) from  Lenny as well. It's for my 59' 
panel and is very well made. I do agree w/ Thom in the fact that the 
upholstery's grain isn't as deep, but on the other hand, it is much softer 
than the original. Excellent cover that will look nice when installed. He 
also set me up w/ the horse hair padding that Wolfsburg West reproduced for 
cheaper than I could get it from them for. 
He seems like a great guy.

Any tips on installing the cover? I know there was a wire down the outer 
edges of my original cover inside the seam.I assume this isn't needed in the 
new cover? Also, are you supposed to let the little spike-type upholstery 
holder go through the upholstery or just nicely grab it? Will I be needing 
hog rings (I know they were originally used)?
Sorry-----It's my first time upholstering a seat and I really don't want to 
screw up Lenny's cover.
I probably won't be doing tis for a few weeks, but would like to collect some 
info.

Thanx - pete
