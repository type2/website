It's probably *technologically* possible, but not politically possible.
Due to some stalker incidents a few years ago, DMV will only release the
smallest amount of information possible.  In the stalker case, some guy
got a girls home address from DMV by providing her license plate number,
then went to her house and killed her.

&gt; I got in touch with a pervious owner of a Binz but he didn't have any of the 
&gt; serial number info or remember who he sold it to.  Does anyone know if the CA 
&gt; DMV can/will look up information on a car based on a previous owner?  
&gt; Appreciate any help offered.
