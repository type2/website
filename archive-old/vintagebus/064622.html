&gt; Does anyone have experience with just how long the interior florescent

&gt; hours?  24 hours?

Hi Greg,
Unfortunitly we are not psychic!  ;-)  Ignoring age of the battery and/or 
operating temp, it depends on how much wattage the light draws and how big of 
battery you use.  Try testing your bus in the driveway with only the light on 
and a battery charger handy for when you find your electrical limit!
