Well, the inside of it has been finished in teak wood?????? don't ask me.
It has one sea that folds down, bed??? Heck, I'll be able to provide you
with more when I pick it up. For now that's all I got and I think it's
cool that it runs. Has new brakes, new battery, hard start
relay..........what's that? It's in a need of a nose job. Compared to the
one I used to own (for more money) which was a total cancer case this one
is a lot better. What do you expect for a grand???? Except for one thing.
The first one, as you can see on the pics, was a DeLuxe. God, I miss
it!!!
Thanks volks.
