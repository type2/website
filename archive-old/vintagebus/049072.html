&gt;snip!
&gt;&gt;a lot less then E bay
&gt;&gt;thingy and mine was complete with all necessary pieces to install

&gt;at his point isn't it kinda a given that almost everything can be had cheaper
&gt;than on ebay??
&gt;m.

ONLY if the seller has never heard of E-Bay!

BTW, bay windows had swivel seats aplenty in most Westy's. The one I'm storing for Karl is double tracked, but the inside is 13.75&quot;
