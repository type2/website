Subject: fuel pump problems

Hello all,
Last night I was looking at my engine (1500 sp) and noticed that gas was 
seeping from different areas of the fuel pump.  I checked the oil and found 
it to be two quarts high.  I have either discovered an engine that produces 
petroleum or it is leaking gas into the oil.. I fear the latter.  I am 
picking up a new pump on the way home and will drain and replace the oil.  
Is there anything else I should do to prevent engine damage?
