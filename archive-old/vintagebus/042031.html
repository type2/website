Hello David,

Thank you for your reply. I greatly apologize for the mistake. My intent was
not to &quot;look like an idiot&quot;. I simply misread his question. I hope that you,
and those on your mailing list can understand that mistakes like these can
be easily made. 

I have forwarded Mr. Alford's suggestion onto both our technical and
editorial staff. I shall gladly contact both you and Mr. Alford if the
pre-63 type 2 manual is made available. I understand that there is a need
for this manual and I have repeated this to our editorial staff.

As always, please feel free to contact us if you have any further questions.

Thank you,

Michael Shellenberger

Michael,

I'd highly suggest you reread your reply to Mr. Alford..as well as his
original question.:)  (below)

He forwarded your reply to the vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com mailing list...I'm
sure you dont REALLY want to look like an idiot in front of the world!!

No flames intended...But we would LOVE to have access to the PRE 63 book
again.

thanks...david

I and a number of my friends are in need of a reprint of your pre 1963
VW transporter manual please see your way to do what you can to produce
it again.
I have several of your manuals, but this one is, sadly, lacking and
unavailable in the used book market.

Sincerely,

Ken Alford
