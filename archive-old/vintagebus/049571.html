What is up w/ these folks? I recall sending them money some time ago, and
haven't seen a thing since...
I always liked the mag; remember them sending a postcard bemoaning some
tension within the org, hope they didn't fold.
And no, I haven't had time to dig an old issue outta the closet and phone em!
