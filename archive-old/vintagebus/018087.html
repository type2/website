There is a lot of misinformation about seat belts, and a lot
more mis-installed belts, perhaps not so much in buses but
in the Wonder Boy Racers who buy a belt out of a catalog and 
have no clue as how to install it.  For these kiddies, the 
appearance of a racing harness is more important than it's 
functionality, which is further echoed by the bright colors 
the buy them in.  &quot;I'll take a red Scroth belt and 2 'TypeR'
stickers, please&quot;

The most common mistake people make is in the anchoring of the
belt; not with respect to sufficient backing area, but with
respect to it's angle relative to the wearer.  Specifically, 
the angles and placement are incorrect; the most 
egregious examples are the RiceBoys who mount the 
shoulder harness to the rear sear mounting location sans a
harness bar or an equivalent.  This can cause a spinal 
compression injury as the belt will push you down into the
seat in an impact.  

While for the purposes of bus driving, most of the harness
discussion is a moot point.  Our cars are not structurally
hardened enough to take advantage of fancy seatbelts.  About
the limit would be a 3-point belt mod like Robert King has
done in his deluxe, but it's only a minor improvement, as
there isn't enough mass in the front of the bus to keep
an invading SUV off of his lap.  

The other half of the 3-point equation
is the seat back.  The rebound from the collision with a
3-point harness will simply snap you *backwards* over the bench
seat, like the twisted deeds I used to perform on my sister's
Barbie dolls.

I recently rode in a 3.8L 911 RSA with 5 point harnesses,
which had track tires on it.  You *need* 5 point harnesses
in a car like that - the brakes alone will pull you out of
a standard seatbelt.  And FWIW, the anti-sub belt won't come
anywhere near your happy parts if the entire harness is installed
correctly.  If you do install an anti-sub belt incorrectly
and have to &quot;use&quot; it; the resulting mess will effectively remove you
from the gene, but still allow you to live to complain about it.
D*rwin was right.

For those interested in aftermarket seat belt specs, in relation
to construction and mounting, I recommend the SCCA web
site (http://www.scca_dot_org)  While their specs would be a bit
of overkill for a bus, it's a good rule to measure by.

If you're that worried about a collision, Snell-90 helmets will
be on Closeout in a couple months with the advent of the Snell 00's
