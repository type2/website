Subject: Single wheel trailer site

Hi everybody,

I just got my site up this past week.  http://www.singlewheel_dot_com  The
site is devoted to information and pictures of Single wheel trailers.
VW howards trailer is up there.  I purchased a '57 Heilite at the SV2's
Bob baker show that will be towed behind my '61 westy subhatch (Bus
Content).  I don't have picture up of it yet, but will next week.  I
know that there was somebody else on the list here with a Heilite,
please email me.  Hope you all enjoy and please send me pics of your
trailers and I'll get them up as soon as possible.

Thanks,
Aaron
