i picked up my bus in wisconsin this weekend. it was getting a new tranny
put in by my friend vince (if you're from the seattle/tacoma area, you might
know him. he lives in wisconsin now). when i got there, all he'd done was
taken the rear hubcaps off. it was kind of amusing, but at the same time,
frustrating. i knew then that i was going to miss some work. we worked on it
for about 6 hours on saturday, 4 on sunday, and another 3 or so on monday. i
traveled back to minneapolis on tuesday. boy, is it cold up here! it took me
about 7 hours. i stopped every 50 miles to warm up. it was a constant cycle
of stop, pee, get more hot cocoa, drive 50 more miles. i used the hot cocoa
to keep my hands and legs warm by holding it. and also kept the inners warm
by drinking it. 

before i left i draped a big down comforter over my westy curtain rod to
keep my own body heat up front. well, it didn't help too much because most
of the heat was escaping from around the driver's door. i found out that not
all the bolts for the hinge are there, and therefore, does not sit right
when closed. i also patched up the heater channel with some JB weld on
monday. it at least got some heat up front. i think i'm going to get some
pvc piping and a cage blower this week to help this out. also some hinge
bolts. i'm going to try to test out my gas heater aswell after i get a 6
volt battery for it. as well as a good old tune up.

this is now my daily driver and i'm planning on taking it to nashville
before new years. who know's i may just stay down there. i'm going to pack
it up like i'm moving down there, and if i get everything hooked up (job,
home) i'll just stay there. i'm going to try to plan my trip around the
weather this time. i don't think i could take 20 hours of cold conditions
like that.

p.s. - you guys were right about the space heater idea.
