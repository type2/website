Is this for a '63-down bus or '64-up?  If for '64-up, something does seem 
odd there.  Is this seal made of three sections glued together? If so, is 
one section a slightly different color than the others?

it appears that it may have been glued... but its a *very* clean seam. the 
top corners are squared off... the two bumps at the beltline are there... 
and the cutouts at the bottom of the hatch in the luggage area and the 
striker plate are there too. its nice.

But nobody actually answered my question, who is ISP West?
