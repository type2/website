&gt;My 1960 DC 611005 built (according to m plate 16/05/0) has the one piece
gates, I belive these to be original, it also has the high hindge wedge
things.  Also the dating chart says this bus was an April bus but the build
date shows 16th of May. Does the M code plate get stamped upon completion
of the build or during?? or is it when ready for delivery?
&gt;
The dating charts on my site, taken from the VW dealership book Progressive
Refinements, states 611 005 occured during May, 1960.

Last Bus in April, 1960.. 601 918
Last Bus in May, 1960.... 615 192
