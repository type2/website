&lt;&lt;This thing eats generator pulleys. Tears them up where the shaft goes
through.&gt;&gt;

Russell, 
My beetle had the same problem.  At first I though it was due to cheap
Brasilian pullys but when I put the Expensive German ones on they got
torn up also.
Turns out the strap that holds down the generator to the stand was not
tight enough.
I would check to see if your strap is loose or the threads on the bolt
could be stripped.  I use an &quot;allen key&quot; style hardened steel bolt and
nut with locking washer on my straps.  They are easier to get at and
hold real tight.
You also want to make sure the Woodruf key is in good shape cause that
will also cause death to a pully shaft.
