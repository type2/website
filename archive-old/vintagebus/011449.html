&gt;I'd like to gather suggestions from the list on things (tools, parts 
etc.) to 
&gt;have along on a highway trip.  Items you were glad that you had, or 
wish that 
&gt;you did, when that inevitable breakdown happened. I'm sure that the 
collective 
&gt;experience of the list can produce suggestions that will help some less 
&gt;seasoned road warriors to happier trails this summer. 
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;---------------------------------------------------------------------

I bring my sockets and wrenches, screwdrivers etc.
I also bring a spare fuel pump, sparkplugs, generator brushes, floor 
jack, spare headlight, hoseclamps, oil, fuses, spare bulbs for other 
lights, spare distributer cap, rotor and sometimes a spare distributer, 
fire extinguisher, spare fuel line, long length of wire, alligator clip 
wires, carb parts, tranny oil, coil, points (although I don't use 
points), jumper cables, fuel, bolt to plug up brake line if needed, 
small air compressor.


What I have not taken on road trips and I have gone far: Spare Tire. 
Takes up too much space.

Kind of stupid about that one, particularly for the places I have been 
including dirt and rocky road, but what the hell.

Jason
