Here is a fwd'd message from the Vanagon email list. I
find the concept of random travels intriguing and have
been proned to meet/invite VW strangers (previously
unmet persons) but personally, I am circling the
wagons, familywise since my adventure at Jerome.
Sacramento Rubber Johnny changed my inclination of
doing a &quot;kind deed&quot; into a locked door.

Pack the VW! Quit your job! and GO!

Ever have one of those days where you just wanted to
say: &quot;Screw it 
all!&quot;
and drive off into the sunset in your VW? Ever wonder
what might happen 
to
you if you actually did it? For those who have, you
understand. For 
those
that have yet to... read on!

9 Months ago my best friend Stephanie and I (some may
know me as &quot;Steve 
in
Columbus&quot;) did just that. We sold the car, the bikes,
gave our 
furniture to
our friends, packed up our Westy and fed the Rat Race
to the cats. 
Since
then we have seen much of America, most of Europe and
a slice of old 
Africa.
And now we just may be in your neck of the woods.

Beginning Wed morning (11.22.2000) we will start a
3000 mile journey 
from
Georgia to Northern California. Our route will take us
on Interstate 20
across the south, Interstate 10 up into California 5,
580 and finally 
101 up
into the wine country.

Our goal is to meet up with Phaedra up in Philo, CA.
And if you happen 
to be
on our route and would be willing to let two 30
something VW travelers 
stop
in for a quick cup of java a friendly smile and a hot
shower, we would 
be
more than grateful.

In return we can entertain you with stories of our
travels over the 
last few
years, and to top it all off both Stephanie and I do
great 
impersonations of
people who have been living out of a backpack for 9
months.

I understand the Holiday season is approaching, and if
you don't have 
space
for us in person, you can at least live vicariously
through us by 
keeping up
with us on our travel web site...
http://WhereAreThey.homepage_dot_com

But if your welcome mat is always open and you are
close to one of the 
towns
below, please let me know via eMail or let Phaedra
know and we can 
check up
with her along the way. We would be most humbly
grateful!

Thanks for your time my friends.
Steve and Stephanie

mailto:s.shane_at_pobox_dot_com (ME!)
mailto:psavage_at_SABER.NET (Phaedra)

Towns on our route:

Jackson. Miss
Monroe and Shrevenport, La
Dallas, Ft. Worth and Abilene, Tx
El Paso, Tucson, Phoenix
Riverside, L.A., Oakland, San Fran and Santa Rosa

PS: Please let me know soon. After Wed AM my computer
will be in a box.

PEACE!
