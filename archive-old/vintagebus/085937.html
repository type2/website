Subject: Busavan to BBBXI from north LA County

I'll be heading out at ohdarkthirty Thursday from Santa Clarita toward
BBBXI in Havasu.  Likely route is CA14 to CA138, either picking up
historic US66 or going through 29 Palms and Parker to Havasu depending
upon the whims of the drivers.

Pace will be 55-60MPH.

Three buses are going in this group.  More are welcome.  Get in touch to
arrange a meetup point!

George Lyle
