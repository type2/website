its way to early to &quot;confirm&quot; the Camberg meet,

Heinz Willi Lottermann passed away in October , 

when I was at his funeral I offered our help to his son Marcus for the next 
meeting,

their first work is running the business after the lose of their father

but no decision will be made for at least a year or 2

We are all hoping there will be a meet , but its way to early to make 
plans........
