Subject: Pulling Dents with a Stud Gun, or lack thereof...
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com (SplitWindows Rule/LagWagens Drool)

I had a good sized dent just to the right of the engine lid on the panel.
right smack in the engine compartment frame.  The frame itself
wasn't bent, just the outer part of the channel was collapsed.  There
was no way to wack it from behind, and I don't own a drill-and-pop
dent puller, so I decided to try the stud-gun route.

Only I don't have a stud gun, and I didn't want to lay out $400 for one to pull this dent.

So I improvised.  I used some nails (don't know the exact name and size)
like the type you'd use on common construction stuff, and welded them,
head first, into the dent.  While the weld was still hot, I used a claw
hammer to pull on the nail, which pulled up the metal.  Grind the nail
back off, and voila, a smaller dent, or in most cases, a slightly raised
spot.  I went thru about a dozen or so nails, but the dent is out, and 
I ended up using about 1/32&quot; of filler instead of 3/4&quot;.  I took a few pix,
which I'll put up when the roll is done.
