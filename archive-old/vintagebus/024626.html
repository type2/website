Kevin,

You say the thingy seems to be in the right position. What I'm
wondering is did you notice if the screw in the end of the thingy is
touching a different thingy that has what looks like a little stairway
on it or is it touching the smooth side of the thingy with the
stairway (Whew). Anyway, the stairway thingy is your high idle cam.
It's supposed to have a pin through it that keeps the stairs facing
the idle adjustment screw (OK, I know the 34 adjusts differently, but
that's beside the point here). Sometimes the pin falls out and then
the high idle cam can flip over. That will cause you to have a
*really* high idle. Go check the position of all these thingys. If you
can, find the pin that fell out, if that's the problem. It's a metric
roll pin and they aren't real easy to find. Maybe somebody on the list
will know what to do about that. Also, there may be other thingys
causing this, but this is one I've experienced.

Have fun
John
