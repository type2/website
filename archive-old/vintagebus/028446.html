Subject: what kind of side windows are these.

Hey all,

I'm looking at purchasing this '62 and I was wondering what kind of side
windows these are ( they have cranks on the inside of the bus ) and if the
stipping is still available or if I can convert them back to the fixed style
of side windows. If you get a chance stop by
http://users.aol_dot_com/my65notch/busside.htm and check 'em out and let me know.

Thanks, Dan
