Subject: Re: [VB] preserving the gold

Maybe not 14K electroplate, maybe not anodizing.
More like paint, or a chemical wash ( in which case &lt;pun&gt;
I want some :). Steam parts cleaner might remove it
Caustic engine cleaner tanks will consume the case.
Try a small test behind the flywheel with kerosene.
The foamy engine degreaser spray can cleaners also
will remove grease and not damage paint, and they hose off easy.

&gt; found a case within a couple of months of the birth month of my 57. Went
out
&gt; and started to clean it and found it to still be gold under the grease.
I'd
&gt; like to keep it that way.
