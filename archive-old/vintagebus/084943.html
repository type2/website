Hey  folks,

I have a 15 window possible project and I have no idea what year  it is.

The louvers into the engine compartment go inward.
No back up  lights.
Large round flat front turn signals
The tail lights are the late  oval like the early bays
The rear hatch has a small window in it. I mean it  looks odd (all the others 
that I have seen are proportional (it also has a  crescent imprint where a 
handle would go and a possible round badge just  above it.
I am not sure if someone was getting crafty with the welder but  it looks to 
have a giant mud flap hanging from the front clip.  (aerodynamics?)
This thing is worked and I'm not sure it is worth my  time.

Any suggestions would be  great.

-Joe


corner windows buses were made through the end of the 63 model year
the engine air vents went from outies to innies partway through the 63  model 
year
 
ergo the bus is a late 63
 
15 windows are really really really cool.     even if  it's a beater bus.    
pics?
