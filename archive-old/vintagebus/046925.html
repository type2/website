Subject: ig lock/TL fix/axle removal etc
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

just thought I'd share a few things I've been tinkering with

last summer my 65 westy started with key intermittantly  It has a steering 
ignition lock and I eventually realised that instead of usingthe wire in the 
engine compartment from the starterto touch the battery, I could remove the 
plastic cover at the steering lock electrical portion and jump the wires  and 
it would work.  Turn key to one, jump wires to start it.  worked every time.  
 SO the theory was that the electrical portion of ignition lock was bad.   
And the other day I got sick of it, and pulled a spare regular ignition to 
install in the bus, but a little voice said.... wait... you really want it to 
work correctly,   so I dug in the garage till I found a small box of misc 
broken steering/ig lock stuff, and found a electrical portion  !!!!! :!!!!!  
I installedthat and it didn';t work either   :(   :(:(:(:   SO I hooked up 
the battery changer and test light to the electric bit and turned it witha 
screw driver and both worked.   hmmmmmm   I realised that the key was not 
turning the piece far enough to activate the starter connection.   HM.    I 
think this is a mechanical wear problem.   But there was a another electric 
bit, which looked slightly different, more plastic bits, had to bend a prong 
to go in the right direction, but it worked with the key.    I guess if the 
thrid one didn't work w/key either  I could have filled up the hole in the 
turny electrical bit with jb weld and moved the slot a tad.

Cool!  I can start the bus with key now.

Turnsignal/brake light on left was out a friend had said, so I replaced the 
whole bulb holder witha shiny one from a later bus with buildt in ground.   
Replaced seal around taillight too.  :)  nice bright lights!!!!

ended up at the VW dealer today, the local one in Oly still has the 
'historical calenders'  free of charge, as in gratis

I had pulled the 61 apart ages ago, and today I  thought I'd assembly the 
axles onto the rebuildt tranny.    but one of the axles was bad (circlip area 
was worn down- had had a bad upper out bearing) and the other was good, but 
the three other axles I had around, were well, not too great, actually I 
didn't really like them much,  one had big pits in the spade end, the other 
two had grooves worn.  SO I thought I'd try to remove the axles from the 
tranny I had had in my 65.   I had tried before, and couldn't get the upper 
outer bearings off.   Somehow the left side  one now would come off after 
about ten minutes wiggling two screwdrivers against the inner race against 
the upper gear.
puled the tube/box off and undid the circlip and pulled out the thrust washer 
and the axle and the fulcrum plates.  axle was okay i guess, not too excited, 
lets get the other .

this one was the pits .  after trying prying it not very far it wouldn't go, 
out I tapped it back in (on inner race with hammer and punch)and examined the 
end of the axle.  okay, no bumps, filed a tad just in case,  pried bearing 
back out- stopped just about even with the end of the axle.   decided i 
needed a puller.  it was very stuck, not just a push fit.   I found a piece 
of metal from a speaker magnet where the inner diam of the circle was only 
just bigger than the axle, but left plently to grab the inner race of the 
bearing.   about 1/8&quot; thick.  cut a notch in it so the circle became a C, 
theory so I could slide it between the gear and the upper outer bearing.  not 
enough room.   more prying, some pounding, ok.   took my thicker C of metal 
and drilled three holes init to line up with my puller .   slide C in place, 
line up puller, insert bolts- osheesh, the circle wasn't big enough to fully 
go past the teeth of the gear, how do i fit nuts in there?   I grind them so 
one side is a V okay I make three hex nuts so one side is a V  now the holes 
in the C don't line up with the notches between the teeth, remove C  and 
adjust the holes.  a couple times.   I know this takes a while, but I will 
reuse this tool.    okay, now the 3 bolts with washers are screwed into the V 
nuts at the geer teeth.  screw in to center bit of the puller and it goes 
into the indent in the end of the axle and I step on the axle tube to keep it 
in place and voila!!!     bearing comes off.

okay, undo 6 nuts around flange, well three studs come off with the nuts but 
oh well, pull on axle tube/inner RGB housing, and it don't move.   really, 
now.   I end up putting big fat washers at the end of the axle and using them 
as spacers and fitting the outer RGB housing and tightening it down with 5 
bolts (those on that end) rounded alternate with the 5 bolts one half turn 
each,   as a pusher to push the axle out and pull the axlle tube/inner RGBox 
half out.  had to do it twice, else I would have had to find longer bolts.   
wasn't sure if it was good to use these that way, but I did.

okay, now pull the axle tube/RGBox half off, and put that next to the bits in 
the RGB outer half .   Undo the circlip, it doesn't want to come out, well 
just one end does, pry a bit and it comes out.   tug, axle doesn't come out.  
Get circlip out of way, look at thrust washer.

The thrust washer has a bump at one side that goes in where the bit in the 
tranny has a notch.  in this case, the thrust washer had rotated  !!! so that 
the bump was not lined up with the notch, but somewhat off, and was, 
therefore, quite stuck.

(are you enjoying this as much as I was)

not only that, the thrust washer, quite understandably, is cracked

(and I was driving this tranny for a while)

I get the chisel and hammer and try to rotate it back, putting the chisel in 
the crack.  it doesn't work too well.   The tranny center section is lying on 
its side, with the one axle pointing in the air.   Iplace a piece of 2 by 4 
under it's nose, so it will be less likely to fall and bash me in the head 
with the axle.   The axle does twist.  hm, the crown gear twists.  well it 
should I suppose.  it try to fall and bash me in the face, I grab the axle, 
and let it down, I hear a crack !!!???!!!  this thing popped out of reverse 
and was noisy in all gears anyway, can't have broke much.   put it back with 
the axle up. Eventually something gives, and the washer comes out, I pull the 
axle out.

rememebr the axle? this was so I could get the axle.  the axle was... okay i 
guess.  place it with the other ones, and pull out the fulcrum plates.  crown 
gears are stuck in there.  hm  I have one crown gear, think one was cracked.

well, that's as far as I got assembling things this afternoon. At least I 
have a few more used parts to choose from.
