Cool!  Honestly, this is one thing I enjoy the most about owning a splitty -
lettng others drive it that have never had the chance.  In my pre-bus days,
there were times I wanted so very badly to drive someone's bus but was too
afraid to ask - not wanting to put them on the spot. Now I make it a point
to ask everyone to the point of insistance if they want to drive it.  Even
if it is just in a parking lot someplace.  Sure, they grind gears, pop
clutches, kill the engine but it's a once in a lifetime chance for many and
I'm all too glad to give them the chances I never had.  You should hear me
when we go on the highway, &quot;Come on, floor it - get on it.  I didn't build
up this bus for it to be babied.  Give her hell.&quot;  The best ride yet was
from Weberlin, a friend of Kurt Long's from Hamilton Canada that was here a
couple of weeks ago.  Weberlin is old enough to be my father and ripped
through the gears like I do. Different story when you're the passenger.
Damn...
