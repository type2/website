&gt;Does anybody know how to run 6 volt semaphores on a 12 volt system?

Yes.  You need to put something in the power wire to the semaphore
(the heavier of the two, and usually striped) to reduce the voltage.
The &quot;volt-a-drop&quot; is simply a resistor that burns off the extra power
as heat.  They work well for things that draw a fairly constant amount
of power (semaphores, single-speed wiper motors) but not so well for
things that draw varying amounts of power (radios).  The other option
is an electronic voltage regulator, which is much better at holding
a constant output voltage, no matter what current is being drawn by
the load.  These are a little harder to find and a bit more fiddly to
wire up, though.

Some &quot;volt-a-drop&quot; resistors are adjustable for various loads.  Others
are fixed for a specific load.  If you get the right rating for the
load, either kind will work.  If your test equipment includes a voltmeter
but not an ammeter, you're probably better off getting the adjustable
kind, as it is easier to set correctly with the equipment you have.  If
you have an ammeter, you can use either kind...the fixed kind may be
a little more compact.

So, how do you know what rating you need?  Since you want to run a 
6 volt semaphore on a 12 volt system, and you are going to connect
the resistor and the semaphore in series, you want to drop 6 volts
across the semaphore and 6 volts across the resistor.  From this it
is hopefully clear that the resistor should have the same resistance
as the semaphore.  Or, equivalently, the resistor should draw the
same amount of current from a 6 volt suppply as the semaphore does.

If you're going to get an adjustable resistor, all you really need
to know is the total estimated wattage of the load.  Then you can
buy a resistor rated at least that wattage and adjust it to suit
the load exactly.  If you're going to get a fixed resistor, you have
to have a more precise idea (from an ammeter) of how much current the
load will draw.

I believe semaphores have 5 watt bulbs in them.  Also, the coil will
draw a few watts - I don't know how many, but I would guess 5 watts
or so.  According to the '57-'61 Euro wiring diagram, a semaphore
probably shouldn't draw more than 12 watts, because the semaphores
share an 8 amp fuse (48 watts at 6 volts) with 36 watts of brake
lamp filaments.  So, if you're getting an adjustable resistor, get
one rated for 15 watts or more and you should be set.

If you want to get a fixed resistor, get a 6 volt battery, your
ammeter, and a semaphore.  Connect the semaphore ground (usually
through the mounting) to battery negative, and the + lead of your
ammeter to battery positive.  Connect the - lead of your ammeter
to the bottom semaphore connection - the one where the heavier,
striped wire went when it is in the car.  The semaphore should
flip up and the light should come on - read the amperage draw on
the ammeter and make a note of it.  Say it reads 1.5 amps.  You
need a resistor that will draw 1.5 amps at 6 V; by Ohm's law,
R = V/I = 6V / 1.5A = 4 ohms.  The resistor will need to be rated
at P = VI = 6V x 1.5A = 9 watts or more.

Whatever you decide, you can take advantage of the fact that only
one semaphore should normally be on at a time to use just one
resistor for both semaphores.  Unplug the black/white/green (feed)
wire at the turn signal switch and connect it to one end of the
new resistor.  Run a new wire from the other end of the new resistor
to the turn signal switch (where you just unplugged the wire).
Note that the new resistor will get hot in operation, so don't let
things that shouldn't get hot, like wire insulation or interior panels,
touch it.

If you got an adjustable resistor, set it in the middle of its 
adjustment.  If you got a fixed resistor, this step will help verify
that you got the right one.  Connect your voltmeter across the heavier
wire to one of the semaphores and ground, and flip the turn signal
switch to that side.  Check the reading on the voltmeter.  If it's 6
volts or pretty close, you're good.  If it's not, and you got a fixed
resistor, you'll have to get a different one.  If you have an adjustable
resistor, adjust it until you get 6 volts on the meter and you should
be set.  Try the other side just to make sure.

Some pitfalls: Keep the 6 V bulbs in the semaphores.  The way a semaphore
is wired, you can't easily supply 12 V to the bulb and 6 V to the coil,
so just leave the whole thing 6 V and supply it with 6 V.  The resistor
you choose *must* be rated for the power it's going to dissipate; it
should probably be at least as big as your little finger.  The tiny
adjustable resistors that adjust with a screwdriver or the ones made
for most audio volume controls can't handly anything near the right
amount of power.

Most VW parts places sell the adjustable resistors.  They are usually
sold for the wiper motor, but can be adjusted to work with the semaphores.
Wiper motors draw 20 watts or so, so these resistors should handle the
lower power draw of the semaphores.  Check with Bus Depot, Rocky Mountain,
etc and expect to pay $10-$15.  To get the fixed resistors, you'll have to
go to a local or mail-order electronics store.  In this case &quot;electronics
store&quot; most emphatically does NOT mean &quot;Radio Shack&quot;.  The fixed ones
should cost $1 to $3 or so; some will also have the adjustable ones (same
as the parts houses sell) for $5 to $8.  Mouser and Digi-Key are two
well-known suppliers; if these names aren't familiar to you, you'll
probably be better off going to a VW supplier.

I hope this helps!
