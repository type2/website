I was a structural engineer on the Renaissance Center in Detroit '74-75
and you don't want to know what ended up in the cement pours on that
job.   Some &quot;objects&quot; may have helped increase something or other.  I'd
guess that a 4&quot; garage pad is too thin to bury much...     Gary Gibson



I always wondered what happened to Jimmy Hoffa.
