I'll buy that, but barely.

&gt; the real answer:
&gt; i am lazy and if i can get rid of the rust by spraying on/off a liquid as
&gt; opposed to grinding all day and taking even more skin off my
&gt; knuckles/sandblasting and having sand in my boxers for a week and making a
&gt; mess of my shop... i'll do it.  The rust is so minimal and surface, that i
&gt; think a chemical treatment will do the trick.  Most of the original paint
&gt; is still there.

I've learned a technique to blast wheels that takes less than 5 minutes 
per, and I do it out on the lawn, so the sand just ends up sinking thru
the grass and improving drainage!

I used to be a chemical guy, but now I blast.  I think the blasting
leaves me with a much better surface to work with, and the paint sticks
to it like you wouldn't believe!
