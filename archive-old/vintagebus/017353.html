Maybe some day I'll drag myself down to AZ
But by the time comes that I *can* afford to take a
week off, I'll probably be banned from any AZ show
anyway because you-know-who will have bought it.

Firstly, Stirring pot in Arizona is not a good idea.
Stiff penalties may be incurred. Oops, never mind on
that one. Yeah, you oughta wander down to Arizona once
in awhile. No you will not be banned from Jerome. We
will just add &quot;tar and feathering&quot; and &quot;longest to
avoid Jerome attendance&quot; contests to the already busy
list of activities. Jerome will not and can not be
bought by &quot;you know who&quot;. It belongs to the people and
is organized/hosted by the Arizona Bus Club.

Actually, we'd enjoy your company and the company of
any other VW enthusiasts when you/they have the
opportunity to join us. Outside of my apparent wiseguy
attitude the AZ Bus Club is a great bunch of folks.
Safety, responsibility of self and support of
deserving charitable causes are always promoted as key
ingredients of a good time at Jerome. =)
