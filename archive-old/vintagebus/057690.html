Subject: Desperately Need One Rear Hatch Hinge Pin

I thought I'd repeat my earlier request.  Does anyone have a short hinge 
pin with the square-ish head on it that I could get?  Or know where I 
could get one?  Its for my '65.  There's no good junkyards out here in 
the tropics.   :-(    I did finally figure out a relatively painless way 
of installing it, but I could sure use a pin to finish off the job.


Thank you!
