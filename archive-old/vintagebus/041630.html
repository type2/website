&gt; &gt;Hi Aaron,
&gt; &gt;Rubber is never basicly the same!  There are so many types of rubber and ways
&gt; &gt;some manufactures stretch thier expensive materials by mixing in cheap
&gt; &gt;filler!  Such as clay!
&gt; 
&gt; Another common practice is to take all the scrap lying (also known as 
&gt; regrind) around and blend it in with the resin used to make the parts. The 
&gt; problem with this is that every time rubber (or plastic) gets put through 
&gt; the extruder it degrades more.  Although not all fillers are a bad thing, 
&gt; as they are sometimes used to make the rubber more durable, flexible, 
&gt; resistant to fuel.....
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;  Take body rubber EDM is the best and resists UV-rays
&gt; &gt;very well and last ten years or more without cracking.  On the otherhand
&gt; &gt;cheap rubber often from the far East with it's filler materials will tend to
&gt; &gt;crack badly in 6-12 months!
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; I'm experimenting with using vitamin E oil to prevent this. Vitamin E is an 
&gt; antioxidant used in the plastics industry to combat parts becoming brittle 
&gt; from exposure to the elements. (I should know more in a few months as I 
&gt; should have a weatherometer by then and be able to do some accelerated testing)
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;   The German fuel line with it's cloth covering is easily identifiable.  The
&gt; &gt;non-name rubber fuel line at your FLAPS is not.  Where did it come from?  Who
&gt; &gt;knows!

As I recall, fuel line has to be certified and marked by the manufacturer,
same as brake line.  I doubt that the fuel line you get at your flaps will
be substandard.

the biggest problem with FLAPS fuel line is that it is sold in inch sizes
and no inch size corresponds closely with 5mm.

As far as quality of rubber, I'm not all that impressed with German
rubber.  Fuel lines that I replace every two years generally have cracks
in their ends, where the SAE lines I put in my C*evy 5 years ago look
fine.

I'll continue to use the German line for the better fit, but I will
definitely keep up with the replacement schedule!
