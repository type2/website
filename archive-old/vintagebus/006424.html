The reason a bus one has to be longer is the axle sits farther back from the
front of vehicle.  A bug tow hitch might make it out to your ball hitch but
you couldn't turn without pressing bus bumper into your bumper.  I've
thought that it would be neat to fabricate some kind of pipe that would bolt
up to the bumper mounts or somewhere else under the bus which would allowing
towing with the bug bar.  I'm sure it would work with a little
forethought...
