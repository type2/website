Hi all,

Fisrt of all, praise the liast for helping me with my tranny problems:
all is now fine.

I am in Quebec, Canada and I will be traveling all the way to the west
coast in august for a 1-month trip in my '67 sunroof-westy. We will
mainly be in Canada (Alberta and BC) and in the northern US (OR,WA).

What are the good shows and gatherings in august that I should try to
attend? We might make it to BBTA in early september. We'd like to meet
listees and other splitty owners, cause here in Splitty-Challenged
Quebec, it's a fairly rare occurence to meet other splitty owners!

While I am waiting for my Neato stuff (hope I get them before I leave),
do you have any garage that I should go/avoid in case of problem?

TIA
