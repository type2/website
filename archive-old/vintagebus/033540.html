To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

Hey SG, NQ, others, list,

Nice job on the BBB web cam stills.  Very gracious of you to contribute your 
time.  

Okay, one has really got me.  Who is this with the checkered 
double-door-on-one-side stretch splitty pulling the airstream?  What on earth 
powers that thing?
