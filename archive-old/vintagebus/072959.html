'Aint it grand to see a repaired bus!
Just imagine how those rear wheel guards will look
when they're returned to their original stylish shape
;o)
Even if it's little bits it always made me feel better
when I saw work done.
I recently picked up my 67 Panel from the body shop &amp;
had to drive 4 &amp; a half hours each way to bring it
home but the wait was worth it.
And so was the money.
I'm sorry you had to learn the hard way.....beer money
sadly attracts mainly those only interested in beer.
Now it's up to me to do the next stage on my
Panel.....pity it's an average of 39 degrees F outside
and there were predictions for scattered snow falls.
I have a garage but I don't fancy laying on the
concrete with a wire wheel getting the scaly surface
rust off the underbody &amp; rust proofing it in this
weather.
I guess it tests your resolve!
Here's the link for the trip home of my '67:
