Subject: 66 Owners manual

I have looked on the net and haven't found a vendor w/this manual or one
that is online. I would be interested in either purchasing a copy of
someones or buying from a vendor.  Also would be interested in learning more
about the SO 42 interior.   I have one but how do you use the water
container/cooler? From reading on the net I still don't know if my map
holder had a cap?  Sorry to ask such trivial questions but my 75 had both
manuals!  All help would be greatly appreciated?  Anyone out there going to
the Bug On Sunday Aug 9 in Monrovia Md?  I would like to talk split busses
so I can learn more, although I will probably drive my 75 since I know it is
running properly.

Thanks!
