&gt;I just ran across an add asking for a &quot;TRUCK&quot; bumper for a 
&gt; double cab.   &gt;&gt;

&gt; Hi Benj,
&gt; Only if the truck was a pre-1959 model.   Eric&amp;Barb

My DCab built december '59 has an ordinary bus bumper which needed to have
the inside corners cut in a bit to accomadate the square profile of the rear
three quarter panels. This post reminded me of the swearing I did when I
tried to fit the newly straightened and sprayed bumper the night before
setting off on an epic journey.

Had got the bumper from a friend and hadn't thought of fitting it up.

later 

michael
