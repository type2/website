Subject: Re: [VB] re: Keeps eating wheel bearings?

&gt; I'm using wheel bearing grease.
OK
&gt;
&gt; I'm wondering about the tightening tho.  I tighten it sung, but so that
&gt; I ca still move the washer with a bit of force.
Sounds right

&gt; Also, its possible that one brake pad is not adjusted right...I'll be
&gt; fixing that today.
Shouldnt affect bearings

&gt;
&gt; I'm also pretty sure my alignment is off, but the tires arean't showing
&gt; any wear...
I dont think alignment will affect bearings that much.

&gt;
&gt; Does any of this sound like it would lead to wheel bearing death?

NO

What else could it be?
Have you checked to see if that wheel is running hot? If the brake is
dragging and heating up maybe it could break down the grease.
Try different grease?
Bad bunch of bearings?

Good Luck
