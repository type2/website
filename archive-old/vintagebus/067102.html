&gt; I was thinking of gluing some polar fleece up there... 

Hi Diana,
Be carefull of doing that!  When we got our 1960 walk thru panel camper 
conversion it had indoor/outdoor carpet glued in squares to the roof behind 
the two front seats.  A few years later we were camping and the squares start 
to fall down releasing rust flakes all over.  Seems to be the carpet kept 
water vapor that we breathed out against the steel roof like a sponge for 
long periods and this caused the rust.
  For now we would suggest you investigate for any leaks of water getting 
into your bus and when parking it open the upper air intake vent all the way 
open.  With this vent open overnight especially the water vapor has a way to 
make it out of your bus and reduces the foggy windows and wet interior.
