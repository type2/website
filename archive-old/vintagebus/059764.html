Subject: Re: [VB] loose heads

The top 4 studs rarely need retorquing. If the botton studs were retorqued
and they are still loose, it probably means they are pulling out of the
case. To correct it properly, you need to remove and dissassemble the
engine.

&gt; My neighbors bus has loose heads(1600 dp brazilian case), loose enough to
&gt; make an exaust type noise. He called the lazy local mobil vw mechanic who
&gt; tightend the 4 on each side most easily accessed (put loc-tite on them to)
&gt; and called it good. Neighbor goes out and drives the bus around this
morning
&gt; and of course they still aren't tight. He's ready to quit. I told him
there
&gt; where 4 more on each side and that there was a sequence to be followed and
&gt; to try again. He just thinks the motor is garbage and no need to try. So
my
&gt; question here is- Is this a simple as it seems? tighten everything back
down
&gt; to proper toque in poroper sequence and all is well? Is this going to
cause
&gt; other problems? Any info would be appreciated.
