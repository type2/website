Subject: Identifying a limited slip tranny

From the Thing list...

&gt; The only numbers I could find read=20
&gt; AV22 01 4      Does this mean anything to anyone?=20

Yes. &quot;AV&quot; transaxles were fitted on IRS Things but didn't have limited =
slip=20
differential.

&quot;AW&quot;=3D IRS with limited slip differential, ring and pinion 8X33
&quot;AV&quot; =3D IRS without limited slip differential, ring and pinion 8X33

Another way to know if  a transaxle has a limited slip differential is =
to=20
look at oil filling nut. If you can see &quot;SPEZIAL OIL - SPERRDIFF./LIMITED=
=20
SLIP DIFF.&quot;, there are good chances that this transaxle has a limited =
slip=20
differential.
