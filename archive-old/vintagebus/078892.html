Hi Eric &amp; Barb,
  The &quot;Kubota tractor diesel engine... stuffed ...into a small British
sports car&quot; is from a set of plans that were available from Mechanix
Illustrated back in the early '80's to build car called the Urba Centurion,
where you built the body out of plywood, Styrofoam, and fiberglass and
mounted it on a Triumph Spitfire chassis. The 17HP 3 cylinder Kubota diesel
engine along with the Triumph manual transmission with overdrive reportedly
yielded 85 MPG at 55MPH, and over 100 MPG at 45MPH. The plans were developed
by Quincy-Lynn Enterprises and are actually still available at:

   Don't know anything about an air cooled diesel VW.

&gt; Hi Tom,
&gt; We heard a story years ago that VOA in the late 1960s or early 1970s had a
&gt; diesel AC bug that was stolen and abandoned by the thief when he could not
find
&gt; a gas station with diesel.  We have seen a show about two guys who took a
&gt; Kubota tractor diesel engine, and stuffed it into a small British sports
car.
&gt; They were able to get over 80 MPG with the setup.  We sure would like to
find
&gt; info on that one again or some AC diesel engine and figure out if either
would
&gt; work in a bus.
