Subject: [VB] Different Rack

Sorry, link got messed up because of reply characters.

I just bought a 66 Deluxe hardtop and it has what looks like a factory
rack,but I have never seen one like this.  Take a look at
http://communities.msn_dot_com/1966DeluxeBus/shoebox.msnw?action=ShowPhoto&amp;Photo
ID=11 and let me know if you have ever seen one like this.

Thanks.
