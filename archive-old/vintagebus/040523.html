Subject: The Best Electric Fuel Pump?

Hey everybody:

In order to eliminate a vapor lock problem I had with my 'dub, I installed 
an electric fuel pump about a year ago.

People keep trying to tell me that those little rectangular, solid state 
pumps are not reliable and do not flow a high enough volume at high engine 
RPMs.

So far, the pump has worked fine.  Does anyone out there feel that there is 
a better pump for my 1641 DP engine with a stock carb?
