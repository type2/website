According to the 50 Years of Bus book, it looks like a lot of power companies in
germany had this setup, only with telephone poles.  I woul imagine that the
weight of a hacked bus may be a little more.  That is, of course, unless you add
a little weight to the back of the 5th wheel bardoor, like say, the rear 1/2 of a
rust-free 21 window to balance all but about 100 lbs or so over the rear wheels
of the barndoor and the newly grafted 9 window?

&gt; I wonder what the weight load would be on the rear and what you you have to do
&gt; to make up a reasonable mount for the kingpin.
&gt;
&gt; Got a barndoor you want to lend to the project?
