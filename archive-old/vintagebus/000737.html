&lt;&lt; Whaddaya mean......? Did a tach make you change your driving style? &gt;&gt;
Hi Jdd,
Definitely, it showed us that we were driving way too high of RPM than we 
thought we could hear.  We started out in type 1s where you can hear the 
engine extremely easily when it hits 3,000 RPM _at_60 MPH, had lots of 
experience, of lower MPG, and of over heating with them during the summer 
when going over that RPM.
  Then got our 1963 SC, and thought we could hear the 3,000 RPM point in 
fourth gear, but constantly got lousy MPG (18-19MPG when official VW MPG 
rating was 24.), all too often flickering oil pressure light at idle (Even 
high idle.), and had to rebuild the engines at about every 30-40,000miles.  
Several years later got the our 1960 camper conversion walk thru panel, and 
after installing a new engine could not get it over 45MPH on the flats.  
Turned out that the tranny had been rebuilt badly so that it was taching at 
4,000 RPM _at_ 45MPH, &amp; would do 35MPH _at_ 3,000RPM. Tried the tach on the stock 
SC, and found it would only do 47MPH _at_ 3,000 RPM in fourth.  Over time found 
a stock tranny for the panel that tached the same as the SC's, and slowly 
tired bigger, and bigger rear tires (Panel had cut out wheel wells.) to up 
top speed while keeping to the 3,000 RPM limit.  Finally got to 53.6MPH with 
biggest rear tires (29&quot; dia.).  Then suddenly speed limit went from 55 to 65, 
and up out in the countryside.  So finally we went to a freeway flier tranny 
which depending on what sized rear tire gives you 60+MPH _at_ 3,000 RPM.
