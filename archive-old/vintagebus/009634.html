:coachbuilt Frickinger hearse was originally constructed from a single cab
:but it has a bus rear bumper. I looked at this detail for awhile once and it
:has splash pans on it. They fit the pickup square rear corners snugly, yet
:they also fit the round bus bumper. That one is a poser. If it wasn't VW
:that made them, then Frickinger went to all the trouble to manufacture a
:splash pan to fit a bus bumper, when the truck would have theoretically come
:with a truck bumper. Very odd. I suppose they may have ordered a stripped
:truck to build the hearse from, but still you would think they would have
:ordered the correct bumper if it were available.
:

I can't explain it, but the splash pans from the original (truck) bumper fit nicely on the repro bus bumper that I put on Rosie. I wish I had hung onto that old bumper now. I thought they were the same.
