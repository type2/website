&gt; Hi all-
&gt;
&gt; After getting
&gt; kicked off the
&gt; computer
&gt; tonight by the
&gt; wife, I was
&gt; thumbing
&gt; through her
&gt; recent May
&gt; issue of
&gt; Cosmopolitan to
&gt; see what
&gt; giberish she
&gt; has been
&gt; reading.  In
&gt; the swim suit
&gt; section
&gt; (honestly hon,
&gt; I wasn't
&gt; looking at the
&gt; girls.....)

Yeah, right!

&gt; I
&gt; noticed a few
&gt; shots of a swim
&gt; suit beauty
&gt; modeling in and
&gt; next to a even
&gt; more beautiful
&gt; and sano 23
&gt; window.

Page 253 and 254

&gt; The
&gt; florida plates
&gt; tell us its a
&gt; 61 and its
&gt; orange and
&gt; white.

It also had a european-style front plate that was unfortunately
obstructed by the model's legs.  The owner is obviously quite picky
about damage to his bus, as the model is sitting on a tatami mat in
the rear hatch (keep that makeup off of the upholstery!)

&gt; Who is
&gt; the lucky guy
&gt; to own this
&gt; babe (bus)??!!

I bet he was hovering just out of camera range, lest anyone ding his
bus!  :)

George
