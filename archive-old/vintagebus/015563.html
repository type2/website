The usual catches with these are a mileage limit (the most generous
I've seen is 5,000 miles per year, most are more like 750) and
stringent storage requirements (locking garage with limited or no
visibility inside from the street/alley, etc).  The intention is to be
able to insure a collector's vehicle, which is trailered to shows, not
driven on a regular basis.
