Subject: vintage n*zi please respond

I write this half smashed.  Please forgive.   where's the trappist :-)



I don't know why,,, but the spell checker and thesaurus keep me in
line...  




Ok.  So I have this 59 double cab VW, built on the day they switched
from the 36hp to the bastard 40. I could restore and keep the history
but I choose not.  I'm interested in vintage speed. You know that stuff
that happened before *ME*.  I have lots of magazines, catalogs, etc.
etc. etc.. I look at them often.  My goal is to produce a *kewl* VW that
some how represents something of the past.  I wasn't there..

My goal is to research, look, see, smell, taste,. well ok, licking
optional, what was the epidemy of the era of the VW scene at the time.
what time you ask. well, that's the real question.

I, for some reason want to place this vehicle at the earliest possible
time frame.  The other part of the brain pushes for what is available

 (ed. Note. even this rant is edited)
 
Is it important to produce something that is as period correct as
possible or to capture a specific time frame as period correct?

My mind is at turmoil.


In other words, should I push for a specific date i.e JULY 8, 1975 or
should I say, this is a vehicle that has been scrutinized to the last
washer and is correct for an *0s era car .

With the internet at hand, anything is possible with time.
