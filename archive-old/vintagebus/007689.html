renoir,

It's fitting that you use a brush ;)
I'm not a big fan of brush painting though... spraying is easier for me to
do, and I'm partial to the final product.
The engine compartment of my '65 is currently sporting a coat of brushed-on
Rustoleum rusty metal primer... (#7769???), from a can.
I'll do it at least for the non-public bus areas... but I'll still throw
some spray enamel over the top of the primer for my own satisfaction and
viewing pleasure.
    The dark red primer color makes me want to glue some miniature
sagebrushes over in the left hand corner of the engine compartment... maybe
get some hosses, a well and a stagecoach and have a regular southwestern
diorama theme going on back there. get the chuckwagon dog food commercial on
tape and it'd be even better...
Whenever i do brush paint something i start thinking about the PBS Bob Ross
painting show and lots of &quot;happy little trees&quot;...

later...

&gt;Hi renoir here,
&gt;
&gt;I use a quart of rustoleum from homedepot and paint it with a brush. Sunset
&gt;Red is the color.
&gt;That is enough paint to paint the van twice or more. If you get motivated
&gt;you can wet and dry sand between coats. It looks good and protects the
&gt;metal.
