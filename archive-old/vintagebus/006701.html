Has anybody out there driven a 40 HP 1500 plus miles on a single journey???
I really want to drive the side loader single cab back from iowa/nebraska,
but have never had a long distance experience with a totaly stock bus!!! It
should be a blast as the bus has been totally restored (refreshed?) rebuilt
engine, new brakes, paint, interior, etc. so the ride should be nice and the
bus should make it, anybody want to meet me in Iowa and ride back to az.or
New Mexico, doing some wrecking yarding and bus hunting along the way?? Have
tools will travel.
