Subject: Re: [VB] measuring springs

Hey Joel,
This is kind of an expensive way to go, but you live in the LA area?  I
don't know who all carries them but there are German OEM engine assembly
kits that include new springs, plungers, caps, seals.  They also have T3
blockoff plates, studs etc.  Berg sells them for $15, but if you try to
mail order you have to order $35 more stuff or they won't talk to you.  If
you walk in the door I'm sure they will sell any small part.  They want to
make it worth their time to do the paperwork of a mail order I guess.
Anyway this will work good.  Another option is get used OE ones, but if
you don't have an OE one to compare to then it could be a problem.  I've
used these kits in my rebuilds using new cases and used and they have
worked fine.

John K.
