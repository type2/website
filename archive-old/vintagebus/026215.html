&gt;Wow man - great pix!  What kind of camera are you using to take these?
&gt;BTW:  That Westy is awesome - it's got a lot less rust in it than my &gt;66.
&gt;Mine has so much rust, I'll have to park next to Rusty Bus to look good &gt;or try for the ever coveted &quot;worst of show&quot; award. :-)

NQ I told you before. All the work that you are doing on your bus will
likely take you out of the running for &quot;Worst of Show&quot; here in Omaha. If
you still have the rust (and the courage) when you come to the show in
July you can be sure that I will give you my vote. I'm hoping for a new
special award. Most Improved. I'd win that right now hands down. With
all that new sheet metal I could win any one of a variety of possible
awards. Most Weight Gain, Most Improved Aerodynamics, Metal From The
Most Countries(5-6, I don't remember for sure), and my favorite, The
owner of a restored vehicle that now owes favors to the most number of
generous friends.
Cram's motors would be a good choice. Based on his knowledge of part
numbers by heart he is very knowledgeable. And he makes good motors from
everything I've heard. Robert Laffoon can jump in here if he knows any
better.
 I am also impressed by the pics. Great images, small image size. I'll
repeat the question. What kind of camera?
