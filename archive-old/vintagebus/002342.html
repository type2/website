Hi to all you deregulated CA residents.

Troubled about the electric rates? Take a look at www.turn_dot_org you can
get information as well as email your opinions etc to your
representatives.

At the very least, let the Governor know that you won't vote for him
in another election if he can't get this thing under control.

Bus content:  The steering wheels are soon to be. Get your orders in
now and send me your horn buttons for the free paint job.

Chris
