Hi,
Just make sure to keep all the wires for the starter out from between the 
starter, and tranny when installing the new starter.  Did not do that on one 
of the first starter changes, and ended up cutting of the wire to the 
solinoid!  Also it is a good idea to slather a little wheel bearing grease 
onto the tip of the starter so when it is installed the bushing gets some in 
it.  Eric&amp;Barb
