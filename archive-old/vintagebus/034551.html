&lt;&lt; Hi, anyone know if 64 bus door handles are unique to 64?  Another thing, By
 looking at the number plate on the overhead fresh air vent, how can i tell 
 what year a bus is?  thanks in advance, Matt
  
  &gt;&gt;

if the 64 has a push button handle, the handle is a 64-66 handle.  If it is a 
pull handle, the drivers side is unique to early 64 as it came with a T 
series (64-66) key rather than the 54-63 key.  If that keyed handle has not 
been swapped for an earlier one.


do you have an idiot book?  It has a list of vin number/production dates in 
the back somewhere.   find teh vin on thetag and check it on the list.  you 
can also look behind the passenger seat, and findtheM code tag, about 2 by 3 
inches, copy everything off that, and go to the decoder at vintagebus_dot_com
