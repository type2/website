Subject: parts stash buy

Picked up a small stash of 36hp items today... one complete motor (looks
like if I can unfreeze the rusted pistons it is a plug and play motor), one
longblock and one case, plus a raft of crud; mostly early bug vert bows and
latches, lights, etc.
Only real 'score' was what looks like a complete BN5 (minus ON switch, but
pump stuff in tank, weird little fuel filter, all lines ) - anyone have a
good wiring diagram? I have the BN4 stuff from the VB web site.
If I can get it to work, I might see if I can adapt it to the singlecab.
Also got the bus VW logo offa the wall, tho I felt a little bad, as he said
&quot;man I gotta keep SOMETHING from the last 14 years!'

If anyone has any vert needs, ping me.
