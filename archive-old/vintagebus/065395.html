&gt; I thought the proper way to adjust the brakes you want the slightest rubbing
&gt; to be occuring-the idea being that a tiny bit of the brake shoes will wear
&gt; off with a little driving around, and that way your brakes are nice and
&gt; tight. The way you described doing it-sounds like your brakes would be too
&gt; loose.

Bentley says to tighten until a slight drag is noticed while turning
the wheel by hand, then to back off the adjuster three or four clicks
so that the wheel turns freely.

I've always done it your way, but considering that I had all new parts I
decided to do it closer to the book.
