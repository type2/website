&lt;&lt; i just put out a request for a shifter rod that I want to scratch.  i have 
a
 straight style shifter from an early '59.  I used a later model shifter
 holder and it was too tall which made the shifter not stay in the cup on the
 shifter rod.  Then I used a bug one and it was too short and wouldn't shift.
  Is there a mid sized one for that style shifter or is it the same as the
 later models?  i did notice that the throw is shorter on the straight bus
 shifter than the curved bus shifter indicating it might be a shorter holder.
 
 Any help would be greatly appreciated.
  &gt;&gt;

about the piece under the bus- the front half of the shift rod, the ball on 
the shift stick goes into the socket on the front of the rod

p/n 211 711 155  Rod - gearshift,front  up to chassis # 501 706
p/n 214 711 155  Rod-gearshift, front  from ch. no. 501 707 up to ch. no 835 
087
p/n 211 711 155B  Rod-gearshift,front  from ch # 835 088 up to ch #216 028 111
p/n 211 711 155C  Rod-gearshift,front  from ch #216 028 112 

there is the stick in the cab:
p/n 211 711 121 Gearshift lever up to ch no 501 706
p/n 211 711 121A gearshift lever, from ch # 501 707 up to ch # 216 028 111
p/n 211 711 121B Gearshift lever.  from ch# 216 028 112

I suggest you try using the parts appropriate to your bus' manufacture
