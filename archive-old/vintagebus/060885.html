Subject: Re: [VB] Re: [T2] Re: [VB] Wheel Powdercoating not a good thing?


It was about 3 weeks after installing my P.. coated
wheels, crawling along in afternoon traffic &amp; i hear 
this sound that tells me a bad thing is about to
happen.

Two of five nuts are gone on the right frnt, the
others are finger tight. At that time I was glad for
slow traffic.

After that, I put lugs in before having them done.
