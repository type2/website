Subject: Re: [VB] Body work

Ed,
I ran into the same problem with the wheelwell lip. I used a pneumatic line 
sander, which kept my hand from &quot;rolling with the curves&quot;. It did the trick. 
You have the right idea with the 14&quot; sanding block for the corners (once 
again, to keep from dipping and curving too much). I use a rasp to take down 
most filler, and use the sander/block when I have a good &quot;line&quot; to work 
with. Experience is gonna be your best measure... Maybe you should do it 361 
times (grin). Hope this helped.
