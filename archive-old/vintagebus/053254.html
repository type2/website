&gt; Yeah, I bitched at them a while back.  Assuming that did anything (probably
&gt; not), you can blame me for your increased registration fees...  ;)

registration is due on my sunroof beetle in november and my truck in january.  i paid less than last year for my sunroof and the bill for my single cab is less than last year too.

does this change mean that if i buy the '62 panel i'm thinking about, it'll cost me more to transfer title and register it in my name than it might have six months ago, last year?
