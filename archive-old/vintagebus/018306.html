Something for AOL 6.0 users to consider:
I just went to yahoo and got a free email account so I
can post to the list.  

I am set up so inbound messages go to my AOL address,
but my outbound will be done through yahoo. Since I
don't post very often (I enjoy reading more than
writing) this set up will work fine for me.
