&gt;  This brings up a topic I've been wondering about.  I don't believe I've 
&gt; ever seen a splittie doublecab or singlecab sporting a gun rack.  Since I 
&gt; live in the Old South maybe I should think about getting one.  Anybody have 
&gt; any recommendations or experiences to share?  Will an off-the-shelf gunrack 
&gt; do, or is it necessary to have one custom-made?    B^)
&gt;  
&gt;  BTW you do know I'm joking?  Right?  Right?
&gt;  
I have seen gun racks on  a couple splitty SC in the PNW.   There was one 
truck, a 62 or something, bright orange paint on the dash, a bit rusty, a bit 
dented, gun rack, cut wheel wells, FS, I wanted it, but no title and the guy 
selling it was a jerk.  
My friend Rick has a gun rack in his Chevy truck, which he uses mostly for 
holding levels (he works construction).  So you can also call them level- 
racks.
