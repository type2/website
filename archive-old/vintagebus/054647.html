Subject: Re: [VB] Interior Question


Hi Don,
  I saw an interior like yours at Ennis last month but I can't remember the 
name.  It was 2 words and started with a K or a C.  Something like Custom, 
Classic, Craft, I don't remember.  Jim Share, did you see it? The cabinet 
was exactly like the one in your link and on the opposite side was something 
that looked like a magazine rack with the manufacturers name wood burned 
into it. I also, would guess that the U-shaped bracket was to hold a child's 
cot.
Sorry I couldn't be of more help.

&gt;Can someone click on this link and tell me what the the U shaped cutout on
&gt;the shelf above the closet door was for?  I have a '61 panelvan that I am
&gt;trying to identify the interior on and my closet and sliding door match the
&gt;one in this picture exactly.  Maybe someone put a westy interior in the
&gt;panelvan but I have no idea what that cutout would be for.  Thanks.  Don.
