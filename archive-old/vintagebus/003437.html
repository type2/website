In my experience, I've found the #1 cause of brakes pulling to either side
is rotten rubber brakes lines that aren't allowing the fluid to properly
return to the MC thereby holding a little bit of pressure in the WC on one
side as opposed to the other.  Other causes I have seen though are a leaky
WC leaving fluid on the shoes and drums as well as a worn tie rod that
reacted under braking conditions and causing the wheel to steer outward on
that side.

Just a few things you might want to check.
