The Stud gun ,,(weld stud to pull dent out ,no holes ) is the best shot ,,you 
might even have to pull a Thom and put a jack or portapower of sorts aginst 
the edges of the vent area inside to push them back up into place ,,BTW Thom 
,,good idea on the jack to the front floor area on your bus ,,and sounds like 
a great shinking job on your doors ,,keep up the good work ,,
