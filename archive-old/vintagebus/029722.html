&gt;So I checked in the archives, found the &quot;defintion&quot; on Thom's page, but
I still don't understand what the relationship between VW and Binz was.
 Did VW make the chassis, etc, then Binz modify it?
&gt;
Short version:
VW delivered a Primered Single Cab body to Binz, who performed the modifications.

A longer version, from my under-development Binz page, can be found at:
http://thesamba_dot_com/vw/type2/photos/binz.htm

Please email me with any corrections.
