Subject: RE: [VB] POR15 thoughts/opinions

&gt; Secondly, once your surface has been PORed will primer adhere 
&gt; to it?


I'm a POR15 dealer.  (We carry only the POR15 itself for now, not their
other products, which as I understand it are not all that different from
what you can buy at a good auto body supply or auto part store.).  While
I can't claim to be an expert on the product other than having used it
myself, I have been told this by the factory: Normal primer will adhere
to POR15, but must be applied while the POR15 is still tacky. On the
other hand, if you are proceeding straight to a finish coat, you should
let the POR15 dry first.  Incidentally, our part # for the POR15 itself
is (surprise!) POR15.
