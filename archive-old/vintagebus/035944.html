 I would recommend removing the fuel filter from the pressure side of the
 fuel pump, that is bad news.
 
 Actually, remove the plastic fuel filter from the engine compartment 
entirely,
 I put mine right under the fuel tank outlet, under the Bus.
 
 Anybody want to 2nd me?
  &gt;&gt;

I put the filter between pump and carb, but have a longer piece of line to 
loop around the coil.   So far, no problems.
 I dont like a filter when it is not easy to see, or where it will pour gas 
on me when I chnange it.
