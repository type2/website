&lt;&lt; I know this could be a multitude of things, but want to know your opinions 
/ tips, before I order a rebuilt steering box! &gt;&gt;

Of all the busses I have had only two didn't need a new drag link.  That 
would be the first place I check.  Next would be the tie rod ends, then the 
center pin, and lastly the steering box.  There is a fair chance that your 
steering box is worn but I think the other things listed wear out first...and 
even if it is your steering box, it will still be sloppy if all the other 
components are worn.
