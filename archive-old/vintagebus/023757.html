Subject: re;bearings

to all listys interested in bearings for reduction boxes
beware not all fag and skf bearings are what they say they are
all companys are repackagers
if there (oem)supplier runs out they will purchase from an outside
source
i have gotten fag bearings in the same box from the same supplier with
the same bearings
made in 3 different countries,real german are very hard to find (the box
is german,the bearing made in canada,mexico,usa,france, etc. get my
drift)most of my suppliers can tell me the country of orgin (thats where
the box came from) but not where whats in it came from.
there are bearings made in china, japan,india,mexico etc. all are made
to spec so it's your call dollars and cents. i have used all
manufacturers bearings and have not had a failure yet. even the
expensive roller bearing is less money in an overseas version (about
half)
another example of repackageing is TRW,  tie rod ends, usa made prices
for parts made in taiwan,china,etc. as i said don't go by name only,
open the box look at the part
make sure it's made where you think and want, don't get ripped off
