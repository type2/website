&gt;I know how much you all hate to go on Ebay after parts. I will not list
&gt;these there then. I have a front bumper 1959 - 1967 U.S. Style in fair
shape
&gt;and rear apron for Splittie. I have pictures, not developed yet though.
If
&gt;you are in the area or are willing to pay shipping and are interested
write
&gt;me with questions. It's not going to be an auction. At least for now.
