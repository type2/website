Haven't read too much about govenors on the list - what is the general consensus on these?  Make a bus too slow?  Takes away some of the control you have over speed?  

I was trying to put a 66 21 back into original condition and was wondering if they were hard to come by.  Any leads?

Question two: Maybe another stupid question, but what does the acronym FLAPS stand for? (As in &quot;I visited my local FLAPS for a govenor but couldn't find one.&quot;)  You might answer this question for about 400 other people - or I might be the only one under a rock, I don't know.  Answers highly appreciated!
