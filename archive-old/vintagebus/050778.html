Subject: Re: [VB] throttle cable cuts trans

My bus is doing the same thing. It is quite common. Some people run a tube
to protect the tranny. Other people just lube up the tranny with grease in
the friction area. I guess it was just a design glitch by VW.

&gt; My throttle cable is ever so slowly sawing through my transmission

&gt; is this happening?
&gt; In my bus the throttle cable emerges from its tube beneath the bus at
&gt; about the same area as the nose of the trans, then runs exposed (and
&gt; touching the trans in one spot) until it enters the short tube running
&gt; through the forwardmost piece of engine tin and the fan shroud. Am I
&gt; missing any pieces here, some kind of bowden tube or something? Was
&gt; there a housing over the exposed cable?
