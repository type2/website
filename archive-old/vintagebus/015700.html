Had an &quot;almost&quot; like that one time.  I helped a girlfriend bring home a
'53 chevy pickup, using the trailer and tiedows my friend used for his VW rail.
The tiedowns shifted and slackened during transit, and you could almost 
have pushed the truck halfway off the trailer with the tiedowns still on.
The only thing that saved it is the fact that those early pickups are HEAVY,
and the flat tires wedged themselves in the front part of the trailer, off
the ramp-part (we watched).

&gt; Had that happen to me once, I was moving a 1955 1 owner original Porsche
&gt; Speedster over into storage from my shop one evening, when i got to my
&gt; storage the speedster was gone! Backtracked my route and found the speedster
&gt; sitting in the middle of the street about 2 miles back, major heart failure
&gt; there, loaded it back on the trailer, useing only my rachet tiedowns and got
&gt; it to storage. Lesson learned, always connect a saftey chain so if your tie
&gt; downs break at least the vehical won't come off the trailer.
