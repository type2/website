Ditto's here, I have shipped parts across the country and had parts
shipped to me. Some I payed for or got payed for, but most transactions
were just the price of shipping. The vintage VW community and the shops
and stores that support it take care of their own.

FWIW I know for a fact Mark and John are great people and are not BSing
when
they say they give parts and help to fellow bussers in need.  Kudos to
you
guys for keeping it real!  I like to believe I help fellow bussers when
I
can as well, but it is easier to reach out and pat someone else on the
back
than coil to scratch mine :)

Granted the list needs to pick up the pace a little bit!

Take Care,
