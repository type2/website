hey everyone,
this is just a gripe i have, you can delete if you don't want to read
on. i have called Bus Depot now for a fourth time today looking for
stuff. and after 5 and a half minutes of trying to describe to the
bonehead on the phone what seals i was looking for for the louvered
jalousie windows i hung up on him. i guess i'll have to get online
and get his part #'s for him and call back. what a jack off. i get so
pissed off when i call these places, long distance none the less, and
know more than the guys selling the stuff. (RMM and BFY are really
good though) the first times i called once for an exhaust and again
for a carb i was arguing with the guy on the phone about the prices
and i was staring at a printout from their website! those times too i
hung up, i can't take it. anyone else have these problems or is this
world just out to make my life miserable??
