Subject: Re: [VB] Found,  singlecab, Long with bus content

I believe john found what he did and im sure Ill get to check it out soon.
but isnt it strange that the original owner would cut up their truck after
only having owned it for 1 year????????? talk about a disgruntled customer!
I dunno - think about buyin a new car these days, if your the OG owner you
get pissed if it even gets scratched, let alone take a sawzall and start
cutting body sections off it. A second owner on a high mileage vehicle well
ok maybe - but og owner after a year? sheesh 'WtF were they thinking'
?!?!?!? Desert racing i suppose.......

&gt;So by your &quot;story&quot; either the orig owner who only
&gt;owned it for a year, or the lil old lady, who wouldn't
&gt;have been that old in 59, cut the wheel wells? I can't
&gt;believe in your story you didn't track down the og
&gt;owner who still hade the hoops and tilt for it.

Only
bummer is the rear
wheelwells are cut and desert tires are on the back.
&gt;&gt; Real faded unpainted
&gt;&gt; dove blue paint.  Then she
&gt;&gt; brought me the Original NV 1958 title sighed by bank
&gt;&gt; and org owner and never
&gt;&gt; put in anyone else name, she only drove it around
&gt;&gt; the desert and never did
&gt;&gt; anything with title. By the dates she bought it on
&gt;&gt; May 14 1959.
