&gt; Please speak slow so I can understand and so that I don't sound like an
idiot
&gt; when I try to stand up for myself on Monday morning ... So far I got .. it
is
&gt; not a block it is a &quot;case.&quot;  and according to Dave W. I shouldn't drive
it.
&gt; Is this because something can happen to the engine ?? Or is it because the
&gt; steering is so messed up ??? I have really jumped around regarding what
&gt; happened .. and when .. So I will try and put it all in order.

BOTH !!! DEAD is DEAD ! People, engines, whatever...
Only a lunatic would let a customer drive home with faulty steering.
It's time to introduce yourself again (your location please), and the name
of your local repair facility.

 &gt; 1)  It is not a NEW engine.  It is a rebuilt one.  To me that is new.  I
guess
&gt; I better watch the way I word stuff.

Yup. New and NEW are two different thangs !
However, Junque is still junk.
Carpe Diem. Caveat Emptor.
Carp is not Caviar !

&gt; 2)  This is a daily driver, so I will probably need to rent a car on
Monday.
&gt; I will have them fix what they caused to break.  The case .. I do not know
how
&gt; the case broke.  The mechanic said it was a common thing .. it seemed
&gt; impossible for that to be so, but I don't know enough to debate him .. I
will
&gt; if you help me.

You can't debate. Tell him you have some friends with old vw's
and they ALL NEED WORK ! ENGINES AND EVERYTHING !!!

&gt; 3)  here is the order in which things started to fall apart.

It's called entropy :)

&gt; Took the bus home and noticed that when I pushed on the clutch, it had to
go
&gt; all the way to the floor to shift gears.

Clutch needs an adjustment.

&gt; One of the sons got underneath and was adjusting the clutch .. It seemed
&gt; better because when I pushed all the way to the floor, the pedal would rub
&gt; against the metal opening ... It was when the son was under adjusting the
&gt; clutch that he said &quot;there is oil leaking under here.&quot;

Uh-oh.

&gt; I could hear  the throw out bearing making a noise.... I think that was
the
&gt; first time I heard it .. and when I drove away I heard this clunking
coming
&gt; from the rear.  In the newsgroup they joked to make sure that &quot;the keg was
&gt; standing upright ... &quot; that is was probably rolling around in the back and
&gt; that was the clunk.  When the joking ended someone mentioned &quot;motor mount&quot;
&gt; Not 100% sure .. but took my concerns to the mechanic ... Got the son to
ride
&gt; around the block but the clunk wasn't there .. By the time I got home and
back
&gt; I could hear the clunk almost all the time .. Brought it back .. said &quot;did
you
&gt; hear that when I pulled up?&quot;  They MUST HAVE .. but all said . &quot;didn't
hear
&gt; anything .. &quot;  I moved it .. it clunked .. they just shook their heads and
I
&gt; assumed I was losing my mind.

Damn! Don't you hate it when that happens :) !

&gt; A few days passed .. still clunk .. still leaking oil .. &quot;vw don't leak
oil ..
&gt; they just leave their scent ..&quot;  That was the comment .. I insisted that
with
&gt; my new [rebuilt] engine, I shouldn't see oil .. To humor me I guess they
&gt; pulled the engine.  I was at work when they did that.  They were also
&gt; replacing the tie rod ends that day.  I came back after work .. he gave me
the
&gt; bill for the repair, and that day they were also to do the 500 mile oil
change
&gt; and valve adjust .. After I paid my bill he told me about the crack.  Told
me
&gt; it was so common .. etc etc .. Couldn't explain why it happened .. just
&quot;that
&gt; is how they are .. blah blah .. &quot;

Grab that check right back out of his hands !
I bet you will get a better explanation, and real fast !

&gt;You can say anything to someone who is as
&gt; ignorant as I about mechanics.

Boo !

&gt; Thing is .. I wasn't buying the &quot;it is common thing ..&quot;  My 71 bus ran
like a
&gt; champ .. I took her round trip to work every day 70 miles.  NEVER A
PROBLEM
&gt; and the rebuilt engine was about 10 years old.  PERFECT engine.  The
engine on
&gt; my bus is a 1640 .. is that right ?? the old bus was a 1600 and the new a
1640

Maybe you can swap for your old engine !

&gt; So here is what I need to know.  When they pull the engine etc etc .. put
it
&gt; back together .. How can I be sure I am getting the engine I paid for ???
and
&gt; not something they just threw together.  Any other info is greatly
appreciated
&gt; .. But not to technical, because I want to sound as if I learned this ..
and I
&gt; want to know what I am talking about so he can't tell me I am wrong.

Like I said, tell him you lost the receipt amd want to start a logbook,
so get him to write it all down so you can understand.
And you will have a real receipt.
Not like you did when you bought it !

&gt; One thing that really gets to me is that if you ask ANYONE in my city ..
part
&gt; stores etc .. they will all say he is about the best vw engine guy in
town.  I
&gt; think he is covering for his sons screw up ..

Too easy. Get the name of the # 3 man. He EARNS his money.

&gt;Could they have installed it with the motor mount already broken ??

Yup.

&gt;there is a motor mount right ??

Nope. It's a 67. I win ! Sorry, Stan:) !

&gt; is there more than one /?

Yup. Two.They are called transaxle mounting blocks.
They do not attach to the engine. Look at your photos.
They go between the transaxle and the mounting support.

Good Luck ! Get Those Photos ! Find the A.I.R.S. list.
