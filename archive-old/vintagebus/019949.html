&gt;For me, I found that VW's aren't what I thought that
&gt;they were all &quot;cracked&quot; up to be. Almost literally
&gt;woke up one morning and suddenly could care less about
&gt;owning, driving or working on VWs.

But still on the VB list, I see.  You can't fool us.  You still hooked.  Better see the shrink, yer in deep denial.  One day you'll be toolin down the road all righteous and 
airconditioned, and some tawdry Binz or reeky waft of burnt oil will impinge on your senses -- you'll be jammin that ACVW needle back in yer arm so fast.

O Mothers, tell your children, not to DOOOO as I have done....
