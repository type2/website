&gt; I just posted  a picture of some brackets I found in my parts

&gt; They measure 2 3/8 long. could these be the right brackets? Or
&gt; are these just the strap anchors that you find on the top of the
&gt; closets for strapping down your tent poles?
&gt; Thanks.

Those look like the cot brackets, but the length seems longer than I
remember. They fit horizontally +- in the pillars &amp; the pole ends snap into
them.

Tom Buese-field tested the cot w/ 2-3-4 year olds bouncing up &amp; down &amp; it
worked remarkably well.
