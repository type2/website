Actually.....a good working elec. choke works as you have described.
The elec. resistance type element inside the choke body heats up a coil
spring that is also inside there.  The coil spring expands and in doing
so, this action is transferred to the choke butterfly mechanism.  As this
motion moves the butterfly...the idle adjustment screw clicks down a notch
or two or three even...
You got a good one!!!!
