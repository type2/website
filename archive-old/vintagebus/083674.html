Subject: Re: [T2] Overheating / to those who use Gene Berg dipstick oil
  temp sensor

&gt; I can turn on the oil temp light (the oil reaches 227 degrees) after
&gt; driving 4 miles uphill floored at 60mph when the engine is warm at the
&gt; bottom. It is a pretty serious hill and when I do the test I pass the
&gt; big rigs which climb at about 45mph loaded.

I would never drive my '71 for four solid minutes with the pedal floored under
any circumstances.  Not enough cooling to compensate.  If I did that and my
engine melted down, I'd call it &quot;driver error.&quot;  If I need the pedal floored
to maintain speed and the hill will last longer than about 20-30 seconds, I
downshift into 3rd and slow to 40.
