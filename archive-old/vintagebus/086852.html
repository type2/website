Subject: tripping on the Mogollon Rim in AridZona

Thursday July 5 from the Aridzona Republic 

 

Mogoo and I left our home at 8am, temperature was already 90 degrees. North
on I-17 to Camp Verde, A/C still on in our Toyota Matrix. Heading East, on
AridZona 260, finally a little cooler. Go about 2.6 miles north on AridZona
87. Turn right on Forest Road 300. This is a dirt road for some 40 miles,
BUT the Best dirt road I have ever driven on. If you want to camp and view
the Valley from the top of the Rim , this is it.  We did NOT see any animals
except for a few birds and lots of squirrels. Magoo and I stopped for lunch
that we had brought along and lots of water. It did rain a bit on our trip,
Gosh that felt Great.!!!! Temperature was as low as 55 degrees, A/C off and
windows down. We visited Knolls Lake and Woods Canyon Lake. Lots of boats,
and Volks fishing. I fished for about one hour and caught a monster crawdad.
You can make this trip as long or short as you want. Lots of people in the
Lakes and swimmimg. Magoo and I really relaxed on this trip we got home by
5PM, but remember we stopped a lot along the way. What's the rush? Soon you
will be back on AridZona 260, to Payson. Hook up on AridZona 87 and head
South to Phoenix and it's wonderful Heat, bummer. A great Day Tripper of a
ride and not far from home base, Bless you all , and Please keep me in your
prayers. Bless Magoo for getting me out of my Funk, uj
