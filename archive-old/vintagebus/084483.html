Subject: LED idiot lights?

Hi All,

The color filters in my speedometer having long since disintegrated, I
have been considering replacing the incandescent bulbs in the
speedometer with red, green, and violet LEDs.

I made a red prototype by unsoldering the glass bulb from its brass
base and soldering the LED in its place.  Then I added a voltage drop
resistor by soldering a pair of spade connectors onto a 330 ohm
resistor so that it connects between the bulb holder and wiring
harness.  For future versions I might try to incorporate the resistor
into the brass bulb casing and then fill the casing with epoxy so that
it's all one unit.

I tried it out by replacing the oil pressure lamp with the led, and it
actually worked (and looked cool- even if it was the wrong color :)
But my question to the electronic gurus on the list is this; if I'm
running an alternator and replace the charge idiot light (2W/12V =
~167mA) with an LED (&lt;20 mA), is this going to be enough current to
'start' the field windings in the alternator?  Is there a simple
circut I could use that would allow me to keep the led while supplying
the stock current to the alternator?

TIA,
Tristan
