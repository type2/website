I have been reading all the notes on the list and what you have to say about 
gl4-5-6, so this might show how confuss I have become on this stuff.  Is it 
a bad thing to just dump 80-90 wt gear oil (like the wal-mart brand) into 
the tranny &amp; rgb's??  Someone on the list said that gl-5 is bad, well what 
is gl 4, 5, 6, really mean?
