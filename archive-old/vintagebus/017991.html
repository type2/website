I SALUTE THIS GUY!!!

(begin Souza-esque music swell)
I salute him...for having the brave foresight it takes
to look at a stock single cab with a blowtorch in hand
and dream upon improving and re-interpreting what
others have deemd peerfection. To pick up the ball
after a tired few have set it down, uttering their
complacent whimpers of &quot;good enough.&quot; One person who
dared to dare. Who dug deep into the banal recesses of
his brain and reacquainted himself with that innocent
sense of curiosity and awe which goes into hybernation
when we reach adulthood. That wonderful daring spirit.

Without it, would we have ever seen the Binz? 
Or the Westfalia? 
Or the 38-window stretch deluxe limo?
Or the Type2 with the bug upper-body hi-roof?
Or the cal-look Kubelwagen?
Or the 24&quot; of missing deluxe dash replaced with a
SANYO boom-box duct-taped onto the top of the parcel
tray?

I say, this person has MOXIE! Although he is a bit
confused, using the Energizer bunny to dress a bus
with two huge Duracell batteries on it. I bet he has a
Ray-o-Vac sticker on the dash: a HUUUGE Faux-pas.
But this man has courage. And the world needs courage.


For my fellow bus owners, without these dreamers, what
kind of world would this be?

A boring one: we'd only have the mini-truck people to
snicker at.

The bed of this thing should have two snickers on it.
Then the license plate could read &quot;FUNSIZE&quot;

Somebody stop me.

black on black death sentence. At least the wheel
wells weren't cut)

&gt; 
&gt; I'm definitely no Original/Resto freak. But not only
&gt; in the price out of
&gt; line in my opinion, but my main question is WHY?
&gt; Well, sorry if this guy is
&gt; a listee but I just can't imagine what would make
&gt; someone do this kind of
&gt; thing.
