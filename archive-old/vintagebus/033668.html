Subject: Overreving

   Well I found out the problem with my new 1800. I lost the intake valve
guides due to overeving. I build my engines to rev high, but didn't do this
one to the limits of what it will turn. My tach was broken (damn VDO crap).
My heads are at the machine shop now getting new guides installed and duel
springs, instead of the single (which are good to 6000 rpm's.  This engine
will rev to close to 7000 rpm's and I have no problem running it at 4500 for
short periods and up to 6000 for hill climbs. I am going to install the new
tach I have to monitor this situation a little better.  I am extremely
pleased with the performance and the power and once I get a few bugs sorted
out I should be real happy along with the DD.
