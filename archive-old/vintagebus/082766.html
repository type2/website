Subject: Re: [VB] rims

Ya, the 15s are 1/2&quot; narrower than the 14&quot;s
 
Parts List say the 1 ton 63s got 14&quot; rims.  but the early 64s got  15&quot;s   
 
Interestingly, this means that for a short time the 64s ( which are 1  ton) 
had the taller geared  RGBs AND the 15&quot;  rims.   As a taller tire covers more 
distance per rotation, this makes  that get lower rpms at the same road speed 
(or a higher road speed at the same  engine rpms) compared to the slightly 
later 64s with the same transmission/  RGB gearing.
