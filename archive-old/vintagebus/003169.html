 Just heard from Ross and Jen and they made it to New Hampshire with no
problems. The Binz ran perfect, only problem was 1 bad wiper blade rubber.
They drove 500 miles per day ( total of 2920 miles ) and somehow missed all
the snow storms. They are driving back to Lake Havasu in a Honda driveaway
car ( to deliver in Tucson Az. a great way to travel if you have no vehicle)
and will leave next Fri. They hope the Honda runs as well as the Binz. They
will pickup their 71 westy that they left at my house and continue on their
trip. They dont have to be back east untill Sept. What a way to spend a
year.
