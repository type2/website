I wouldn't sweat it.  Kyle made a good point
but if you break the cam and lifters in properly (run for
20 mins at 2000 rpm)AND your valve chain geometry
is set up properly it should be fine for the trip.  

I'd just pull em out
next time you have the engine out (after 3000 miles to check
head bolt tension?)

I'm concerned about the dual valve spring situation.  Had I known that I
should have removed them, I would have done it while the heads were sitting
here in the box.  I didn't know that you can flatten a new cam (and actually
I have a stock reground 110) with the dual springs.
