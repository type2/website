&gt;My thoughts are that we can come up with some sort of locking connector,
run
&gt;rubber hoses to each side of the connector -- and have a much easier way of
&gt;disconnecting the engine from the body.
&gt;
&gt;Some sort of locking twist connector.... for about $5 would seem ideal.
You
&gt;know how those in-line single fuses somewhat lock together?  Or how a light
&gt;bulb locks into the tail light assembly?  Or how air hoses lock together?
&gt;Something like that design, a male and female connector that has suitable
&gt;ends for our beloved german fuel hose.


McMaster Carr, W. W. Grainger, most industrial valve and fitting and
pneumatic suppliers all carry a wide variety of fittings like this. Kinda
scary to have a fitting designed to come off on your gas line, don't you
think? Quick couplers that have a shut-off feature on each side of the
connection are available, and this would make the procedure a lot less
frightful, but it's gonna sail way past the $5.00 mark. Can't say that it
would be an attractive proposition to me. On the single cab I have it
bulkheaded through in front of the engine, and you don't get gravity flow if
you keep it above the tank. In buses same basic premise. Bulkhead it through
fixed metal, then you can do the disconnect thing from the top, nice and
neat.
