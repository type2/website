To remove bondo, use heat to make the bondo soft. A heat gun (for paint stripping) works well. A torch will also work, though there are surely reasons not to use this. Be aware, as you use heat, of the materials on both sides of the metal. Paint burns; heat is a catalyst for oxidation (rust).

Heat to soft; scrape off with putty knife. Discard.

Heat guns are cheap. Blow dryers usually blow themselves when applied to this purpose; heat guns burn hair when applied to the other.
