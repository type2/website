Subject: Re: [VB] The importance of fire extinguishers

keep a decent powder extinguisher at hand when doing engine work, then at
least it was not totally in vain.
----------------- Clip ------------------------
Been there, had my engine fire.
Very small amount of fuel makes a big blaze.
The bigger the fire extinguisher the better.
My fire took two five ponders to extinguish.
I think a CO2 extinguisher would have worked better than the powder type
but didn't have one handy.
Just to enlighten yourself ............. take a metal mayonnaise sized
METAL lid, put a teaspoon of gasoline in it and light it. You'll be
surprised how big the flame gets with just a small amount of fuel.
Tape the match on a three foot broomstick, you might get a flash and
loose your eyebrows.
