Subject: selling your bus

Hi..I am still new to this site, but I am an old VW Bus owner. I have a 1966
Bus, since 1971, and I ALMOST sold it in 1982. I was going off travelling for
2 years, and the person was supposed to come give me money, and the deal fell
thru. I then felt it was not meant to be, and would never sell now. I've had
way to many memories...it becomes part of your life; and even now my 20-year
old daughter wants it. I also have another car for going to work each day, as
I've restored the body part, and now want to start on the camper-inside. My
plan: to spend whole summers going to every music/VW/--festivals around the
U.S.A./Canada.
So...if you enjoy camping/travelling/waving at other busses, then I wouldn't
sell.
