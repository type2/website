Now for the questions. Since the engine has never been rebuilt I am guessing
the heads have not been replaced. Therefore they were made for regular gas.
Does this mean I have to run super? I have gotten from the type2 list over the
years if it doesn't knock you can use a lower grade.


I don't have infinite experienc with this thing, but I have also been told to
use high octane gas.  
The other option is to add lead to your gas. This is omething I do
intermittently...I haven't had my bus long enough to know the long term
effects.

What I am not sure about is the fact that my engine was rebuilt, within the
last 20,000 miles. I assume that the rebuilt engine would have had hardened
heads put in, but the previous owner told me I should be using a lead
additive. It doesn't really make sense to me, but it seems like a pretty
simple thing to do-i just do it less frequently then he reccomended.
