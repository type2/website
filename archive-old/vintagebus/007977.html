&gt;Why pull the engine to remove the springs?Pressurize the cylinder with shop
&gt;air and remove the springs and install the single springs.


It's got dual springs and my puller will not get in behind the center
spring.  I'm going to try and modify my tool tonight to grab both springs to
try and prevent having to yank the heads.

This whole thing with my bus is absolutely not fun.  I've been told to use
stock heads, large valve heads and I've been told to use neither.  I can say
that with stock heads, my low end was there but at highway speeds the engine
just fell off.  With these big valve heads, I've lost a little bit of the
low end but once I put the pedal down at highway speeds, hold on!  If I had
smaller tires on it would pull even harder.  So I guess for those that think
a large valve head on a 1776 isn't the way to go, I have to disagree.  It
put the power where I wanted it - at cruise!
