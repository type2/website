That reminds me of a story my friend told me about his friend's VW emblems getting stolen all the time.  He finally siliconed razor blades just behind the emblem.  Came out soon after and found the front of his bus kicked in, but with a bloody emblem still on it.  Wouldn't recommend this trick but it kept his emblem on the bus.

Remember to carry several gas cans but have only one of them filled with
regular gas.  The other ones are full of mixture of gas and sugar so when
the thugs go to stealing, they'll be stalled on the side of the road.  I
knew a guy who kept getting gas stolen by some hoods and he started mixing
sugar in his gas cans.  Within 2 days, the thugs were outside working on
their POS car and couldn't get it to run very well at all.  It ended up in
the junkyard - serves them right.
