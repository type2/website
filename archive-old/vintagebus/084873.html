&gt;&gt; First, pull #1 (blue) off of the flasher, and turn on the ignition.  You
&gt;&gt; should be able to make the arrow light in the speedo light up by grounding
&gt;&gt; the blue wire to the body.  You should be able to do this regardless of
&gt;&gt; the position of the headlight switch or dash light dimmer.
&gt;
&gt; Tried this and got nothing

This could mean:

- The black wire from the ignition switch terminal 15 to the arrow light
   in the speedo is broken.
- The arrow light in the speedo has a burnt-out bulb or a bad socket.
- The blue wire from the arrow light in the speedo to the flasher is
   broken.

None of these things are particularly critical, but they will at least
stop the arrow light from working, even if everything else is all right.

&gt;&gt; [Connect together the two wires at the flasher that aren't blue] This
&gt;&gt; effectively replaces the flasher with a piece of wire, so your outside
&gt;&gt; turn signals should be on all the time.  When you flip the turn signal
&gt;&gt; lever to one side, the front and rear turn signal lights on that side
&gt;&gt; should come on and stay on.  Try each side by itself, then while
&gt;&gt; stepping on the brakes with the key on, then with the parking lights on,
&gt;&gt; then with the brakes and parking lights on.  (Note that the arrow light
&gt;&gt; in the speedo WILL NOT LIGHT UP during any of these tests.)  If anything
&gt;&gt; is not as expected, the problem is NOT in the flasher!  It can be many
&gt;&gt; places but the most likely are the grounds at the rear lights, and inside
&gt;&gt; the turn signal switch.
&gt;
&gt; This works neither

Did you get anything at all to light up, or nothing?

&gt; As stated before my turn signals were working (except right rear w/
&gt; headlights on)

Did you ever try a new lamp back there?  Last I heard you put some
aluminum foil around the lamp base to make it fit better.

&gt; before I put the blinker wiring to spec as on the diagram, thats why
&gt; I do not think it is in the turn signal switch or the grounds on the
&gt; taillights, which are soldered,(should of made notes, LOL).

Random thought... does this Bus show any signs of ever being set up to
tow a trailer?  If so, are there mysterious wires running from where a
trailer hitch would be to the tail lights?  I don't think there are, but
if they are there, you might get rid of them and see if that helps.

&gt; The part# for the hazard relay is 211 953 101A it is a 12V relay.

Has your Bus been converted to 12 V?  Also, what is the part number on
the flasher?  (It may not have a VW-style part number - that's OK.)

&gt; As of right now pin 30 on hazard relay has the purple/blk wire to it by
&gt; itself and that joins up with a blk/grn/wht wire that comes from the fuse
&gt; boxes far right fuse; where these join at is the flasher relay.

This seems OK.  The black/purple and black/green/white wires should join
at the &quot;+&quot; terminal on the flasher relay, if you have an original type
flasher.  That far right fuse is OK, right?

&gt; Pin 86 on hazard relay has the gray wire that goes to hazard switch and
&gt; the light on the dash.

OK.

&gt; Pin 87 on hazard relay has the blk/wht wire to Y type junction that then
&gt; goes to the turn signal switch and the L turn signal.

OK.

&gt; Pin 87b on hazard has a blk/grn wire the goes to a single junction and
&gt; directly to the turn signal switch.

Besides this wire, 87b should have another black/green wire coming off of
it that goes to the right front turn signal.

&gt; The blk/wht/grn wire from hazard switch joins with the blk/wht/grn wire
&gt; that comes from the turn signal switch(S4B1on schematic), they both
&gt; terminate at the flasher.

This seems OK, as long as the connection at the flasher is to terminal
&quot;S&quot;.  Also I'm not sure which schematic has &quot;S4B1&quot; as a reference on it;
what schematic are you looking at?

&gt; And of course the blue wire goes to the speedo light on top.

This is right.  The blue wire should go to &quot;K&quot; on the flasher.

&gt; Does the fact that this is a 12V hazard relay have any bearing?

As long as the Bus is 12 V, it shouldn't matter.  Even if the Bus is 6 V,
the only thing that will happen is that your front outside lamps may not
flash when you have the hazards on.  But it shouldn't have anything to do
with your turn signals working or not.

&gt; Does the location of the wires on the hazard switch have any bearing?
&gt; The diagram shows no pin numbering for the hazard switch so I presumed
&gt; it did not.

Your thinking is correct.  When the hazard switch is off, none of the
four wires that go to it are connected to anything.  When it's on, all
four are connected together.  That's why it doesn't matter which goes
where.

&gt; The PO also had one of the wires that the diagram shows going to the
&gt; hazard switch going to the headlight switch and this is when I at least
&gt; had some turn signals.

That seems pretty bizarre.

&gt; When the three wires that terminate at the flasher are connected the
&gt; only thing that lights up is the arrows on speedo.

If you do this, *and* flip the turn signal switch to &quot;left turn&quot; or
&quot;right turn&quot;, do any of the outside lamps light up?

&gt; Thanks for bearing with me.

You're welcome.  If you want, and if you're anywhere within a few hours
by road of Tulsa, Oklahoma, I'm willing to come by and help you work on
it.  (I seem to remember you're in California but that may not be
right.)
