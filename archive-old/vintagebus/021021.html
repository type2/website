Subject: Re: [VB] RIMCO attitude

&lt;&lt; How about a
&gt; better place to spend my hard 
&gt; earned money.  I know there is Berg, but I wonder if
&gt; the same attitude might 
&gt; persist?? &gt;&gt;

Also, their work is not ALWAYS perfect.  I bought a
set of rods from them a while back, and fortunately, I
weighed them.  Three of them were within 1 gram, and
the fourth was ONE OUNCE heavier.  Always doublecheck
everybody!  Even your brother!
