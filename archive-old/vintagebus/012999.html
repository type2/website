I finally decided to throw some parts on Ebay to try to finance all the purchasing I have been doing on there :)

I have some single cab/double cab side gate latches on there, among other things if anyone needs them.  I will be adding more stuff this week trying to clear things out to get some cash for Bad Camberg.  

The truck latches are here:

P.S.  I have some reproduction Safari windows I need to part with.  If anyone is interested let me know, otherwise I guess I will throw them on there as well.
