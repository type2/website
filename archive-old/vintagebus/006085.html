That bus is beautiful! I wouldn't spend 20 grand on it though. What is ugly
about this bus? I know the vintage nazis cringe at slammed busses, but like
it or not it can be reversed very easy!
As far as the dual carbs go, My sandrail (dell 45s) starts up quicker and
easier than my 67 westy even in cold weather.
