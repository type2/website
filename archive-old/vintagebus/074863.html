Subject: My buses are going up for sale

Interesting how things can change in one day.  For the good of the  
family and hopefully, our new home, I'm going to try to sell my two  
buses.  They are a 71 westy, and a '65 EZ Camper.

Long and short:

71 is in great shape, fully functional, complete and daily driver .  
$3000 obo

'65 EZ is a project almost complete, was running, driving, and  
stopping.  Has big issues with 4th gear - still not sure what the  
problem is.  Engine needs rebuild and is in pieces.  $2000 obo

Here is a link to some pics I took very recently, will continue to  
update when weather permits.

I'll be putting them on thesamba this week, but figured I'd start here  
with the list. Would love them to go to someone who'll take great care  
of them.  Please pmail me with any further questions and for much more  
info on &quot;the boys&quot;

With extremely mixed emotions (but I still do have another one stashed  
behind my brother's house.  shhh....)
