One of the emergency brake cables snapped on Sparky, my '60 panel.  I have
not been able to find a replacement for that year.  Will later years cables
work?  Any help would be appreciated.

the kind of cable you need depends on your vin, as the cable was changed mid
year 1960 (on June 1st 1960)
cable #211 609 701 C (length 3330mm) was used ch # 501 707 to # 614 455
cable #211 609 701 E ( length 3460mm) was used ch # 614 456 to# 1 144 281

The later kind comes up through the floor and attaches to a pin through the
hand brake lever, the earlier kind attaches to an'equaliser bar' under the
floor.- so the earlier one is shorter.

 both kinds are for attaching to the little nut type reduction gear boxes,
with the backing plate that has the external (to the inside of the car,
outside the backing plate) little cover bracket  that holds the brake cable
from falling off.   If you loosen the cable up front, and undo that cover, you
can wiggle the brake cable off the hook in there (done that when I was
replacing a tranny and couldn't get the drums off.  The nut was off, but the
drums just would give.  Used a puller, which stripped out the lug bolt holes.
While working part time, going to school full time, and living 2 1/2 miles
from the nearest bus stop, and 6 miles from town - through the snow, uphill
both ways.  It took a while to change that tranny. anyway..

If you have the big nut rear axle and the later backing plates, you have a
differnt brake cable that has a longer spring at the brake end, with a little
clip in there, so if you can't get the drums off you are SOOL.   The brake
cable from ch# 1 144 282 onwards and for M216 (I ton suspension) is # 211 609
701 F (length 3465)   

Not sure what is available new, or where, as I don't think I ever bought a new
brake cable.  One broke on my early 59 in about 1991, and new they were then
$35, and I thought they should be about $10, so I found a junkyard one.  Now
that kind (post bd to ch# 501 706) is about $60 new, from what I've heard, if
you can find them, but the later ones should be easier to find.

Not sure about interchangability, as the lengths are fairly different.  E and
F are pretty close in length, and probably interchangable,
