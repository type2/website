Subject: Re: [VB] Brake diagnosis experts!

How old are the flex hoses?

That's what I think it is. The inside of the hoses are swollen to the
point that the springs can only barely push the fluid back though them.
The longer the bus sits between uses, the more fluid gets pushed back.

&gt; OK, here's the situation:
&gt;
&gt; On the first brake application of the day, pedal goes halfway to floor before brakes engage.  After a couple of applications, play reduces to
&gt;  normal.  If you let the car sit for several hours, the symptom repeats, but if it only sits for a few minutes it does not.
