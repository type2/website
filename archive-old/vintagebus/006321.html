Hi, I was riding my bike around my neighborhood today and lo and behold, a
guy up the street had a compressor for sale.  I got the specs, any opinion
on it's usefulness for general media blasting, priming, and/or painting
small parts?

He claimed to have used it to paint complete cars in the past and claimed
the compressor had no problem keeping up.  I don't know much about
compressors but here's what I could figure out after reading some archive
articles and asking him about it:

220 volt
2 hp
Belt-driven
30 gallon tank
Oil-less
145 psi max
14.5 psi _at_ 90cfm
5-6 years old
Appeared to be in excellent shape
No regulator but all fittings appeared new

From reading the archive stuff, it appeared 14.5 psi _at_ 90 cfm was pretty
good for a 2hp model?

Price was $200 but it sat in his garage sale all weekend with no sale...

Thanks,
