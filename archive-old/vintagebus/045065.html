I asked if I should put the 64 down or the 65 up shift linkage in my 63 
project.  Most folks says there is little difference in feel.  Eric and Barb 
wrote:
&gt;&gt;If we were to improve the shifting it would be to install both bearing 
types to increase the wear area and get better longevity.&lt;&lt;

So E&amp;B, just so I am not misunderstanding, are you saying to put in both the 
donut (pre 64) and dowel (post 65) type together?  Sounds pretty cool.  
Anybody tried this?  Looks easy enough to do.  All one would have to do is 
add the donut support to a 65-67 after removing the welded on nuts (since 
with the donut support, the nuts are on the support, not the cab floor).
