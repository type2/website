Thanks, David.
And yes, they sure do.
Another friend has been telling me this for a while &amp;
I finally have found the truth of this.
I'm sure if you drive one every day on freeways the
limitations might get you down but this was a
revelation.
I loved buses before but now....well, they're above my
petty quibbles.
They're ingenuity and character is unassailable.
They're not a modern car, but who ever said they were.
And practicality is what you make it.
Anyway, I'm a true convert now.
:o)
Cheers &amp; God Bless
