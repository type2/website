It is inexcusable that Aircooled Junkyard was forced to shut down.

All we could do was save the online presence for posterity. Mr. Horning
says his ISP bill is paid through April. After that type2_dot_com will be
carrying the site _gratis_. It is not clear whether the site will continue
to be updated but at least it will live on as long as the list does.

&gt;This discussion brings to mind the plight of the Air Cooled VW Junk Yard,
&gt;well known purveyor of VW stuff with one of the finest and most informative
&gt;VW-oriented websites on the WWW:

&gt;
&gt;Their battles/encounters with the local bureaucracy are legendary, and,
&gt;ultimately, tragic.  The ACVWJY website won't be up much longer, so catch it
&gt;while you can.  Be sure to click on the &quot;closed&quot; link, and read AJ's final
