Subject: Re: It's here! 

 Hey Bart,
  I did those panels on my '61 Westy thinking it would be=20
near impossible.  Turned out to be pretty easy, no need=20
to steam or shave.
  Take your old panel and lay it flat over the 'replacement'
panel, I had my wife carefully mark the outline of the old onto
the new.  Do ALL the marking on the back of the new panel
with the old panel upside down, very important!  Also mark
the front good side so you can lay masking tape over the=20
wood where the blade will cut.  You run the saw from the=20
back side.  Using a variable speed saber saw with a 32=20
tooth 'metal' blade, very slowly and carefully to cut right on
the line.  Make sure you stay right on the line.  When finished
I marked and drilled the OG screw holes and both panels=20
actually popped right into place!  If you need some pics or more info
p-mail me at vwdragon_at_citlink_dot_net
 Take your time and it will be fine,
   Lou &amp; Liz
