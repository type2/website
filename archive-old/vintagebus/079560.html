Subject: 6v to 12v inverter woes

l bought and installed a 6v to 12v inverter to power my radio/cd in my 63 SC 
and it works buttt...while driving only (seems to work fine in the garage 
running off battery) the CD player plays but after a while from 2 to 20 minutes 
the radio/CD goes dead if I have the headlights on. I have to remove the power 
source to the inverter and as soon as I return pwr it comes alive. I tried 
driving to and from work for several days only playing the radio and all is well 
it never dies so I tried driving without headlights and play the cd and it 
stays on. I guess the CD player is drawing to much amps. I have a Pioneer am/fm/cd 
player nothing fancy and sells for under $100.

I also want to make a small 12v pwr supply from AA batteries or similar and 
hook the memory feed wire to the AAs so I don't lose my station presets and 
clock all the time. Not sure what and how to hook this up or if its reasonably 
possible. Right now I have both the memory and radio pwr leeds together off the 
hot side of the ignition switch going to the inverter which is fused. Its this 
fused connection I have to reset to return pwr to the radio.

Any help would be greatly appreciated.
