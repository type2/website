Craig has explained by pmail that
this is what he meant by &quot;cleaning the case for days.&quot;
The casting sand residue is encrusted in the casting
surface, not in the oil galleys. The galleys are tapped.

&gt; Reminds me of an incident I had years ago.  I bought one of 
&gt; those Scan deep-sump thingies.  It looked beautiful, installed
&gt; it and drove for a while.  The next time I changed the oil, I
&gt; removed the sump plate.  WTF is this?  There was casting sand all
&gt; over it!  I reached my finger up in to the recesses of the
&gt; sump - yup, more of the same.  It was also in the main sump. 
&gt; All in all, a big freakin mess.  That motor was never the same
&gt; after that.
