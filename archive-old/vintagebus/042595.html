BUT,

If the bus has a sand seal that will make things even worse!

If the bus has a sand seal, then leave the box, buy 2 small breater
filters like a v8 might use on its valve cover.  Put one o the box, and
put one on the oil filler stack.

That may not cause enough breathing so a lot of people weld breather
fittings on the valve covers and ru a hose from each of those to the box.
So you end up with a filter on the oil filler neck, a filter on the box, 2
lines from your valve covers to the box, and a line from your fuel pump
blockoff to the box.

Thats why i skipped the sand seal, thats the only way to get the crankcase
to breathe right, and its a PITA

take care,

Steve

P.S. i have never set up a breather like this it just what i was told was
neccecary for a t1 with a sand seal.  You could probably get away without
the valve cover lines, but they are ideal.
