Subject: Re: [VB] Oil change - part III

----- Original Message -----
&gt; I noticed that there is a metallic (copper) sheen to the oil.
&gt; It is pretty noticable.  I understand this is an indication of bearing
wear.
&gt; How bad is this really?  should I be planning a rebuild sooner rather than
&gt; later?

Yes, be ready for a rebuild.  If you do it now, rather than let it get
worse, you might be able to get away with just a fresh set of bearings and
keep the rebuild cheap. Bearings, a gasket set, and some sealant is cheap.
