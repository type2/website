&lt;&lt; Do I have to sand away to bare &quot;virgin&quot; metal or can I just sand the bad 
area smooth and go from there?  On my window sills, sanding to clean metal 
will remove most of the lip. &gt;&gt;
Hi Andy,
Best to remove as much if not all rust as possible.  From what we know of POR 
you have to remove any deep rust or the chemical in it does not have a chance 
to change the rust into a stable material that will not just keep rusting any 
chance it has.
So try out the wire wheel, sand, and Naval Jelly routine or have it 
sandblasted.

&lt;&lt;Also, I have heard people talk about troubles getting a good seal on the 
windshields.  Since the lip is rusty on mine I can safely assume this will be 
a problem for me.  Some have mentioned using roofing tar for a good seal.  
How is this applied?  Do you slop it onto the sill, install the window and 
the clean what squishes out or do you install the window first?&gt;&gt;
Even for Vw the seal never sealed by itself, which is why they always used a 
cement as they called it to seal it.  We slather some on the window frame, 
and like to add a bit more around the outside of the seal, and using a 
codiment container with pull off tip cover a bead between the glass, and 
rubber seal.  The latter to prevent whitening of the laminated glass from 
water damage.  Then use a meduim thickness automotive wire to wrap around the 
seal/window glass, and pull it all into the opening.  Then use either 
kerosene, or WD-40 to clean up excess tar.

&lt;&lt; Is Securit glass collectible glass to be pillaged or is it readily 
available at your favorite VW supplier?&gt;&gt;
No longer availble AKA NLA.

Is removing the dash really as easy as it appears?  It would certainly make 
it a lot easier to paint.  It really could use a quality coat.&gt;&gt;
Yes, it is.  The only problem is you have to dissconnect the speedo cable at 
the wheel, and pull it up into the front seat area.
