&gt;&gt; Does anyone know if a wiper motor and set-up from a '60 is the same one
&gt;&gt; as used in a '65?  Or simply, can they be easily interchanged?
&gt;
&gt;You need a 211 955 111 N which was a one year only wiper motor.  Would be
&gt;interesting to know if the 1966-67 wiper assembly could be fitted into
&gt;there.

From looking at the Bentleys and parts lists and discussions here, it
seems like the wipers go like this:

----------
         - Dec 1953  Single-speed, non-self-parking
211 955 031 (6 V), possible supercede to
211 955 111 (6 V)
----------

-&gt; I think this motor is unique to early Buses.

----------
Jan 1954 - Feb 1960
211 ??? ??? ? (6 V)
  Page E-8 3 of the '50-'62 Bentley mentions this motor.

Mar 1960 - Oct 1962  Single-speed, non-self-parking
211 955 111 D (6 V), superceded to
211 955 111 K (6 V)
211 955 113 A (for 12 V option M 620)
  111 D mounts to plate at 3 places - shaft and two studs.

Oct 1962 - Jul 1964  Single-speed, non-self-parking
211 955 111 K (6 V)
211 955 113 A (for 12 V option M 620)
  Motor mounts to plate at 2 places - shaft and one stud.
  Page E-8 1 of the '50-'62 Bentley mentions the two stud to one stud
  change.
----------

-&gt; Anything from Jan '54 to Jul '64 should interchange, but you may
   need to drill holes in the mounting plate to match the motor you
   have.

-&gt; If you want to convert one of these 6 V motors to 12 V, you can do
   it with the guts of a later Bug wiper motor.  Details here:
   http://www.type2_dot_com/archive/vintagebus/050535.html and
   http://www.type2_dot_com/archive/vintagebus/052865.html .  This may
   also work on the '65 motors; I'm not sure.

-&gt; Wolfsburg West sells (used to sell?) 12 V armatures to do this
   conversion as well: http://www.type2_dot_com/archive/vintagebus/050759.html .

-&gt; In these style motors, the grease can get hard, or the oil can
   separate from the grease and foul the commutator.  Either way, the
   motor runs slow.  They're pretty easy to clean out and repack - see
   http://www.type2_dot_com/archive/vintagebus/035645.html and
   http://www.type2_dot_com/archive/vintagebus/066882.html .

----------
Aug 1964 - Jul 1965  Single-speed, self-parking
211 955 111 N (6 V)
211 955 113 C (for 12 V option M 620)
  Page E-12 8 of the '63-'67 Bentley says this system cannot be
  installed in earlier vehicles.
----------

-&gt; The wiring for this doesn't show up on any of the Bus wiring
   diagrams.  The wiper connections on a '66 Bug wiring diagram
   should show you how to hook one of these up.

-&gt; You can convert the '65 6 V motor to 12 V with the guts of a Bug
   motor; I *think* this is a different conversion than the one described
   above for the motors through '64.  Details here - see last paragraph:
   http://www.type2_dot_com/archive/vintagebus/059069.html .

----------
Aug 1965 - Aug 1966  Two-speed, self-parking
211 955 111 Q (6 V)
211 955 113 D (for 12 V option M 620)
  Page E-12 6a of the '63-'67 Bentley says this system cannot be
  installed in earlier vehicles.
----------

----------
Aug 1966 - Jul 1967  Two-speed, self-parking
211 955 113 Q (12 V)
----------

-&gt; At least according to Bentley, '65 is one year only and '66 is one
   year only.  The '67 motor may have lasted into the bay-window Buses,
   but I don't have a bay parts list.  A couple of catalogs suggest that
   '68-'72 Buses took a 211 955 113 H motor, and then the 211 955 113 Q
   was used again from '73-'79.

I know I've seen something about putting later motors in earlier Buses
but having to dimple the defroster tube to get enough clearance.  I
don't know the exact details on this.

If anyone can clarify or knock holes in any of the above, please let
me know.
