In a message dated 98-08-14 01:18:39 EDT, you write:

&lt;&lt; but maybe I'll get lucky and
 he'll be having another of his Baaaaad Daaaaaaaays. &gt;&gt;

Ken,

You're a real trouble-maker :-)

Stop picking on the children :-)  Their perceptions are as valid to them as
mine are to me.  

What many people don't seem to understand is that a question dictates its own
answer.  Ask the ratio of the circumferance of a circle to its diameter and
whether you like it or not, it's going to be pi.  Doesn't matter how big a
circle either :-)  This brand of rigid reality -- the inescapable linkage
between cause &amp; effect, speed &amp; horsepower, temperature &amp; wear, mass &amp; gravity
-- tends to upset illeducated youngsters, especially when the conventional
wisdoms which rule their lives has told them otherwise.

As to the message you forwarded to me, within the context of the questions I
am asked, I give the best answer I can.  When I don't know the answer, I tell
them so, suggest other avenues for tracking it down.  But a lot of times I
don't answer all, in the case of especially silly people.  Not silly
questions, mind you.  Silly people.  Big difference.

&quot;Silly&quot; Question Example:  The relationship between 'lugging' an engine and a
'lug' wrench.  It took me about an hour to write her a suitable answer.  (Try
it.  It isn't an easy question to handle.)  

Silly People Example:  Everything in the 'sermon' file is bullshit.  To
'prove' it, he describes his crankcase full of Slick-50, four Split-Fire
spark-plugs and the Magnetic Turbocharger on his fuel line... which allows him
to get better than 40 mpg while cruising at 85mph in his stock 1965 bus. 

Other than to offer my congratulations :-) there's really no answer to that
type of message.  Nor to the ones you forwarded.  Without the original message
I've no way of knowing the details of the exchange.  Odds are, they wanted me
to tell them pi was equal to 3.0000.  

If the person is able to post the original message and my reply, I'm willing
to let the List decide the issue.
