Dan,
Having done a less complete restoration (external body only), I think it is
important for the restoration guy to adequately warn you about the extent of
the work that you want done and give you a good idea of the expected cost and
the other problems that are likely going to come up. The final cost will
always be more that this initial estimate, ALWAYS. You will find other things
that you what to do &quot;while you are there&quot; and there will be unforeseen
problems. He is preparing you for what will come 6-18 months from now. Now is
the time to consider whether THIS BUS is the one that you want to restore, or
perhaps you should look for a bus that will require less of the expensive
restoration work to get the bus that you want. But emotions create a
significant attachment to the one in front of you. Been there, done that. Just
because you have lots of time, money and effort in the bus in front of you
doesn't mean that it is the best or most cost effective bus to use to create
your dream. Dreams don't come cheap. 
Picky is a relative term; you are being warned that the level of work that you
want will cost $$ in the professional experience of this restoration guy. 
Another word of wisdom &quot;You can't polish a turd, no matter how hard you rub.&quot;
