Hi list,

     Its Matt in Pa.  First off, I was traveling east on Rt 30, between 
westmorland mall and latrobe (slightly east of Zand M motorcycles), in my 81 
Tan/brown VW rabbit, and I gave a big thumbs up out the window to a passing 
brown (primer?) with darker brown trim, split window bus.  Anyone on the 
list?


Later,

Matt in Pa.
