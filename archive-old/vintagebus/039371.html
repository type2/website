Hello all,

First, something off topic:  I have a 1960 Ghia that has it's original split 
case tranny that I am planning on replacing.  What would be a fair selling 
price for this?  And would anyone here be in need of something like this; I 
don't know if it works or not, but soon (month or so) I'll put a motor in 
the car to find out.

Bus content:  I have a copy of the VW book &quot;Workshop Equipment of Local 
Manufacture&quot; (updated to 1967) and I'm sure you've seen it referenced in the 
Bentley manuals.  I'm talking with Andrew of the Obsolete Documentation 
Project to get it scanned so soon you all will have another reference at 
your fingertips in case you needed one of those VW Specialty tools 'of Local 
Manufacture'.

Alex
