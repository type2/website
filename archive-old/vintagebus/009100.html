thanks andy for the super quick reply , indeed it was the mc  pushrod play,
i would have responded sooner but the nut was stuck on the rod, and i had to
put another nut on the end to get the first one loose and then i had to
tighten the first one all the way to get the one off the end, now the
adjusting nut is stuck again all the way, but at least i can adjust it now i
just cant tighten it it down

my next question is that my mc is leaking around where the reseviour screws
into the mc,  can i use permatex here? or do i need to find an o ring of
some sort????
jb

.........
&gt; yes
&gt; either the MC adjustment doesnt allow enough free play to release the
&gt; pressure or there is a blockage or valve problem in the MC rear circuit.
&gt; so
&gt; A-Readjust free play-doesnt cost anything
&gt; B-replace MC
&gt;
&gt; I always start with the cheap things fiirst.
