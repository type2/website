This reworking is what I believe they were referring to as not being
able to get any.  If you have to spend as long reworking it as you
would making it from scratch, you haven't saved anything by buying the
mal-formed piece.

Also, the body shop never claimed to be restoration experts.  That's a
completely different shop.
