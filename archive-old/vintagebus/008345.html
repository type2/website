&gt; had the endplay dialed in at .0035&quot; but after installing the oil seal and
&gt; retorquing the flywheel, I would loose my spec. and the flywheel assembly
&gt; would become hard to spin.  The guru is going to get this job - I give up
on
&gt; it.

    the key to measuring end-play is to always move the flywheel in and out
using opposing sides at the same time, i.e., always grab the flywheel with
two hands while someone else does the measurement. the object is to
eliminate any possibility of screwing up the measurement by &quot;tilting&quot; the
crank in the bearings.

    you also need to make sure you aren't using any warped shims, and that
they are the correct thickness. we always measure 'em first, regardless of
what they are supposed to be.

    you can eliminate a lot of these problems by setting the end play before
the crank is put into the case, because that involves only the crank,
flywheel, shims, and rear main bearing.

&gt; get the gear out and rotate it one notch.  This required being adept with
a
&gt; phillips screw driver, long nose punch, and holding a flashlight in my

    i've had fair luck with a sharpened #2 lead pencil jammed into the hole
of the drive gear...
