&gt; Yep.  They (our government-monopoly insureance company) are saying the
&gt; damage is worth about $1500.  The roof is pretty seriously damaged.  A
&gt; horrible, terrible no good really bad day.  And unless I can prove the
door
&gt; is faulty it would go under my collision insurance.

Is there damage to the door at all?  If so you can show that the bus hit the
door, not something else.
Then you could park the bus under the door, and take a photo with a yard
stick in place showing the clearance from the gutter , and then take a photo
of the roofrack and spare tire (maybe try and straighten the rack slightly)
to show that there is easily enough clearance.
By taking photos of the door you can show that the damage is from leaving
and not entering.

With this evidence you may be able to convince the insurance company that it
is not your fault.

I don't know how your insurance works, but any claim we make in the UK makes
our insurance go up, unless another parties insurance pays up.  So if your
bus catches fire, gets broken into, has a tree fall on it or any other
similar thing your insurance goes up by hell of a lot.  Not fair!
