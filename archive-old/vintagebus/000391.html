Subject: Re:  [VB] aluminum filler or what is bondo ?
Message-ID: &lt;0.7a321cc4.254730f3_at_aol_dot_com&gt;

All of them have a polyester base, the only change is the filler

Bondo- talcum powder
marglass- ground up fiberglass cloth
kitty hair - cut up fiberglass mat
all metal   ground up aluminum

marglass and kitty hair are the strongest if you are filling holes( better to 
weld them but...) the fiberglass pieces are larger then the talcum powder so 
they have something to grip onto.
 you could not do finish work with these, you would have to do a skim coat of 
Bondo.
I have seen some scary stuff &quot;sculptured&quot; out of this, complete rockers etc.

a good body man will use alot of filler BUT most of it will end up on the 
floor !
there ready is no practical way to &quot;metal finish&quot; a car and use no filler, 
yes in the $100,000  range cars but you would be amazed at what is under that 
shiny paint !

My Rometsch was aluminum skin, hand hammered with a skim coat of Bondo across 
the whole thing !  From the factory in Berlin.....finest German work !
