Jim,

I can tell you from experience from last winter to stay away from those
Dansk heater boxes unless you park your bus when it gets cold. My original
rusted heater boxes put out more heat than the dansk units (which btw have
the aluminum fins inside, not the low budget stripped out versions). It has
much to do with the internal shape of the exhaust tube which is round on
the dansk units. If you look at some line art of late model (1500 and up)
engines the factory boxes have an oblong cross section that allows maximum
heat to be transferred to the interior. Eric&amp;Barb enlightened me to this
and can probably explain it better than I can. If I had asked the list
beforehand I could have put the money towards my side scoops instead.  :)

'66 SO-44 Westy
Yes, I drive it in the winter, too.



&gt;Pulled the engine on our '65 Westy yesterday, too hot here in CT, and that
&gt;bolt over the starter did not cooperate....we are installing a brand new
&gt;engine for our trip to Newfoundland, and with the engine out, I found that
&gt;the heat exchangers are shot. I think this bus will be with us for along
&gt;while, so who has the best heat exchangers? Any opinions?
&gt;
&gt;Also, the seal in the transaxel is bad, are there different ones for
&gt;different years? What should I be looking for? The catalogs seem to list
&gt;one size fits all. thanks again, Jim
