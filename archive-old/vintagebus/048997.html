Hi everyone,
 My bus is for sale again!    I posted this bus about a year ago and wasn't
really eager to sell and didn't care if I did, so I wasn't in a big hurry to
finish.  Now its finished about as far as I want to take it and I need the room
in my single car garage for my next project.  The list is the first place I'm
attempting to sell, next I will try the internet classifieds and then the local
paper probably for a higher price.  Price is $8.5 K and negotiable, especially
to list members.  Please e-mail for a more detailed description, answers to
specific questions, and pictures (Please -  only serious inquiries).

Here is a brief description:

65 - 21 window ragtop
all seats (inc. middle with kick panel)
Rust repaired (mediocre)
Powder coated pop-outs (rust free!)
Always garaged 4yo paint job (salmon &amp; wimbledon white)
New rubber
Safaris (busboys)
1600 DP with alternator and doghouse excellently maintained

Major needs: upholstery, wall panels, head liner (one in a box - included - I'll
let you have this fun), rear bumper trim. I think that's all the major stuff.

Very sweet looking- real attention getter - see pictures!

Runs and drives VERY strong.  Drive it home form Portland Oregon!  (FYI - Bus
was purchased in Tucson and trucked and always garaged in Portland were it was
never used as a daily driver :)

Thanks,
