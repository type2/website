&lt;&lt; I have a few places I can and do do work on the van but, I have to confine
 it to things I can do in a day.  If any of you have any ideas on what I can
 do in a few hours to help me feel more comfortable on the trip ( other than
 a tune up and changing oil), please feel free to suggest. &gt;&gt;
Hi Jon,
OK, here is what you do.
1. Park where you can do some work during the day.  Hopefully it is a place 
where you can have a friend help you put the engine in the cargo compartment 
overnight for security so you can do the work over two days.  If not you can 
do all of this in one, but it makes for a very long day.
2. Remove engine and strip all the cooling tin off down to just the long 
block, heaters and muffler.
3. Retorque all the case and head studs.
4. Complete or install thermostatic bellows system. 
5. Measure the inside width of your cooling fan.  Hopefully it is a 33, 34, 
or 35mm width.
6. Fix or replace any missing or incorrect cooling tin.
7. Clean the cylinder ans head fins of crud and oil/dirt build up.  
Brakeklean works well getting into those hard to get to places in the fins to 
degrease the crud.
8. Make sure your clutch disc is bigger than 7mm.
Grease the needle bearings inside the FW glad bolt and replace or grease the 
throw out bearing.  
9. Make sure the throw out bearing is held centered side to side in relation 
to the input shaft and that there is a little slop in the throw out bearing 
arm to allow the bearing to center itself.  Make sure the throwout bearing is 
held by it's clips to the TO arm firmly.  If at all loose then replace with 
new arm that is not worn.  Make sure TO arm is welded with a bead of metal 
(Not spot welded together!) around base of arms to prevent failure if not 
have it welded or replaced with such.
10. Eye the clutch arm that the end of the clutch cable goes through and make 
sure the boden tube is pointed directly toward it.  If not you need to 
replace the arm (Curved or straight arms.) to get the cable straight from the 
tip of the boden tube to the arm or replace clutch cables as the wear on the 
missaligned end of the boden tube about every 10,000 miles or less.  Make 
sure boden tube has it's proper curve.  Replace clutch cable if frayed.
11. Check and replace cracked axle boots.
12. Replace tranny/RGBs oil or at least check for fullness at the center 
section.  
13. Replace rear tranny mounts if needed.
14. Replace engine to body seals.
Probably lots more to come up with, Eric&amp;Barb
