Subject: Re: [VB] Oil Cooler Block Off Plate

Ah, good question.

I have built a 1915cc engine with a case tapped for full flow.  I am 
installing a Bernie Bergmann Porsche 911-style cooling fan/high output 
alternator and low-rise, one-piece fiberglass shroud, which requires me to 
use an external oil cooler because the stock cooler will not fit under the 
shroud.  This is why I am using the block off plate.  I am putting in a 
Kymco external super cooler w/ fan along with a dual filtration system (one 
filter in the deep sump, another reg filter in line to the external cooler) 
out from the full-flow taps as well as a  thermostat to control when the 
external oil cooler will be engaged and when the fan will come on.

I suppose I should have included all of this in my first message, but I 
guess I was too focused on just the block-off plate question itself.  I 
wanted to be sure that I was doing everything right installing it.  As you 
can see, I am hyper-focused on providing all of the cooling I can for this 
engine.

Thanks again,

Richard

why are you doing this?  It seems an odd thing to do to get rid of the oil
cooler.  WHy not have an oil cooler?

I
  hope some of you can help me with.  First, let me describe the plate:

  It is a flat plate with a U-shaped hump for the flow-through tube.  The
  &quot;hump&quot; has a hex-plug that provides access to the flow-through chamber.
