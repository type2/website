&lt;&lt; if you have the time, the best thing for removing pop outs is &gt;&gt;
Hi Volks,
If you do not have time and it is on a bus that no way can be saved you can 
just disconnect the latch from the inside of the body.  Then on the outside 
of the bus you open the popout to about 30-45 degrees open.  Grab the top 
rear corner of the window with both hands and pull down.  The spot welds 
holding the hinge (See Andy we learned! ;-) ) to the body will pop apart like 
a postage stamp.  Eric&amp;Barb
