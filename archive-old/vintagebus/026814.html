Subject: [VB] Heading West

Hey, I'm new to the list last year, and being in the military I'm
getting moved.  I'm going from Charleston, SC, up to Merrill, WI, then
out to Bangor, WA.  This will be my first trip coast to coast, and I'm
driving my '67 Bus.  Any advise before I head out in a couple weeks or
for along the way would be a great help.  I'd like to thank the list for
their help and info, and to the Full Moon Bus Club, and a special thanks
to fellow type2 listee Dave Jersey for his time spent with me and my bus
and his help whenever I needed it.  Without this help my bus would
probably be sitting in my driveway with me wondering what to do with
it.  The Full Moon Bus Club helped me to get out to see parts of
Charleston and South Carolina and meet some of the really cool people
down here.  I feel I've learned enough from Dave to fix just about
anything that could happen on my trip (which is usually the
unimagineable when talking about busses) and am getting excited to start
out on the road.  So I end this message to all listees:  Thanks, and
Happy driving--Chet
