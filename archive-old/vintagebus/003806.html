Just a little family spanking. Pay no attention. While you may think that
this bashing seems a little rough, for those of us that have been here a few
years it is a nice breather from our monthly brawl between the vintage nazis
and the wheelwell hackers. We are all nice folks, didn't you read about how
one of the brethern hooked up the green young feller in Wisconsin that
needed a double door seat? Just sit back and relax, there aren't but a few
types of conversation on the list. Someone is broke down and looking for
help, someone just listed a part on eBay, the brawls, obscure little
restoration details, and mind-numbing reruns of tire sizes, GL-4 tranny
lube, WalMart toys and 009 flat spots-all of which will be along again
shortly. Feel free to start them if you wish.
