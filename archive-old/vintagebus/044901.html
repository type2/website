&lt;&lt; After examining both of these dizzies, I've determined that the zv/jcu 4
 r 3 has a leaky diaphragm, but the 0 231 129 019 seems to be ok (except
 for the locked-down shaft, which I will fix).
 
 The 019 is equivalent to a 009 (sez Jim A.). I wanted to keep my engine
 compartment as clean as possible (no vac lines, if possible), so I guess
 this is my new dizzy...
 
 I don't see an adjustment for the spring tension on the weights. I've
 been told that an 010 has this adjustment (boss won't let me have that
 one!).
 
 WetWesties website shows different numbers for the cap and rotor (03
 010, 03 019 for the cap; 04 033, 04 008 for the rotor). Can anyone pin
 this down, or does it matter?
  &gt;&gt;

I understand that the 019 has a better advance curve than the 009 (ie no 
flate spot) and it has seemed flat spot free performing in my experience.  A 
little harder to find tune up parts for, but no biggie.  I was thinking 
actually, that as the cap seems just like the 009 cap except the 019 cap has 
the cut out for the wire attach for the condensor that it would be possible 
to file a notch in a 009 cap and use it, though I have not tried that yet.
