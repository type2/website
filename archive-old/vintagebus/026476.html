I am looking for some assistance with getting my Blanpungkt (sp?) radio
in my 67 Camper working. On the back of the radio, there aren't any
wires coming out, instead there is some sort of outlet for a plug which,
I assume, attached to the wire harness. Does someone have one of these
plugs? Or perhaps just knows what wire goes to where in the outlet. Any
help would be greatly appreciated.

Chris
