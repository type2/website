Subject: Re: [T2] Tail lights?

Hiya Bryan,

I cannot speak for Indian manufacture, but I have purchased taillight 
housings and lenses separately from sources in Brazil.  I decided that I'd like to go 
with the European (amber over red lens with a two bulb housing) look in my 70 
Bus.  I figured more light - more safety.  So, here's what you may be getting 
from the third world.......

The housings were pretty rough from a workmanship point of view.  But much to 
their credit, two years later I have had no problem whatsoever with them and 
they still look like new.  The lenses (which are no longer available from 
Brazil - now they are selling a real cheapo amber lense with a painted red bottom) 
were also of pretty decent manufacture.  The chrome lense ring was one of the 
cheapest VW related parts I've ever seen.  The &quot;chrome&quot; was flaking off 
inside of two months.  I had those rechromed and everything is hunky-dory now.
