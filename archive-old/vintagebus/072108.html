Subject: Re: [VB] RE: Parts ordering experience w/ 4 vendors

Ya, I found that the people who took the orders at Bus Depot were not bus 
people, and could not answer questions  about the parts.  Pretty much I think 
they write down the orders, and someone else boxes them up.   Yes they are a bit 
vague about shipping times, but the prices are cheaper!!!!    So if you don't 
mind doing your own research and getting stuff in three boxes on three 
different days, it works.   And they had those really nice windsheild seals.     And 
how often have you bought parts for your bus and still had them sitting around 
months later cause you hadn't got around to doing it yet?  So what's a few 
days in shipping?

 WW has a speedier shipping system, and you tend to talk to VW heads (well 
Rich is really nice, he has a velvet green splitty,  but I talked to some other 
guy there once who was kinda a dick), but the service does come with a higher 
price tag.  (you can check the websites and compare prices) It gets here quick 
though.  Consistantly never more than 4 days, usually 3.
