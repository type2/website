Since it's friday and E-bay is once again fair-game,
go to http://www.forbes_dot_com/asap/2000/1127/134.html for
a story Forbes ASAP magazine is currently running on E-Bay.

It's an enlightening look at some of the scams, frauds and underhanded
tactics that sellers sometimes use to boost bids, rip off buyers and scam
the unsuspecting. It also goes into several examples of how buyers have
turned around and brutally hosed people they have bought stuff from.

I've never sold anything on E-bay, but I have bought some stuff, VW related
and non VW.
So far, I've only had minor disappointments and have never actually been
ripped off, but, as the popularity of auction sites grows, so grows the
number of sleazeballs who will populate the site.

I think everybody should read it, just so you know what to watch out for and
so you can prepare yourself should you have a situation that heads straight
into the toilet.

Good luck
John Flowers
