Hi NQ,
Use a black permanent pen to paint the seat and the face of the valve that 
sits against the seat.  Then install the valve and rotate it against the seat 
a couple of turns.  Then remove the valve and check for an even ring of wear 
through the marker on both the valve and the seat.  Then if marks are even 
all the way around on both then check that the wear rings are on the correct 
angle surfaces.  It still might be a good idea to lap them to seal better.  
You want them to hold water without any leaks!
  If the marks are just a little light on one side and are on the correct 
angle surface you can lap them in to place.
