Every VW I have is converted to 12 volt and I will do the same to all I have
and will have in the future, not that I don't like 6 volt ( I do have
starters, generators, both styles of voltage regulators, flywheels and all
the bulbs in stock), so it's not like I can't get the parts, I just like the
convienence and on the road reliability of 12 volt, try to find a 6 volt
battery in BFE, even in my little town 6 volt batteries are hard to get and
are special order (In a pinch I could use a golf cart battery, we have ton's
of those out here), but do as you wish and enjoy your VW.

ps; start collecting those 6 volt flywheels, my flywheel,crank, rod man just
scrapped at least 5 tons of them, said he'd sell 1 or 2 a year, as compared
to 50 12 volt a week!

Jeez, people!  It's not as if converting to 12V is the same hacking out the 
wheel wells.  I'm a firm believer in 12 volt and all my cars are 
converted.  And if you don't like 12V it's no big deal to swap it back 
(although I can't imagine why you'd *want* to apart from bragging rights or 
a trailered show car).  And keep in mind that *I'm* a  MUCH bigger vintage 
nazi than most!
