Thanks Ted, and thanks Vintage bus list for the well wishes, but she went
into a coma the night before last .. her kidneys shut down and I believe the
doctor called it an hypotic or hypatic coma.  She opens her eyes but sees
nothing and talks ONLY to her grandma who died 30 years ago.  They are
keeping her comfortable but the doc doesn't give us much hope.  I spent the
day there yesterday and the night in the bed next to hers [hospital 2 hours
from my home] hoping she would just wake for a minute to let me know she
knew I was there.  Once I said, &quot;just say yes, you know I am here.&quot;  She
turned her head in my direction but seemed as if she was looking right
through me.  At 2 in the morning my cell phone rang, it was my
daughter-in-law saying my granddaughter is in the hospital.  She had a
pretty severe asthma attack.  So I drove home, gonna take a shower, go to
work and then to the hospital.  The asthma attack is a common thing, no need
to rush, the doctors just like to keep a close eye on her.  She will
probably be out tomorrow morning and then tomorrow night I will go back to
Ocala for the friend and spend the weekend.  [I hate not driving my bus, it
feels so unnatural to drive a car.]  Tried two mechanics yesterday EARLY
morning to fix the broken bolt.  Neither one could or would or had time or
the right bolt .. I will worry about that, but while on that subject, so far
both mechanics say about 3 hours labor to remove the broken bolt and replace
it.  JEEZ .. one says &quot;maybe he can do it without removing it ..and would
try that first .. the other wants my money or doesn't think he can do it
without pulling the wheel or whatever to remove the bolt.

THE END .. long and rambling as usual .. but time to shower, just got home,
and go to the office.

Diane
