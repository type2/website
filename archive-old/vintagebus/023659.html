In a message dated 98-10-21 01:38:37 EDT, you write:

&lt;&lt; when i stepped on the brake pedal after seeing a couple cars ahead of me
 slowing down for pedestrians in a crosswalk, the pedal was HARDER than usual
 and i didn't slow down (almost time to panic).  i pushed a bit harder and my
 left front wheel locked up pulling me to the left.  thun the wheel like crazy
 to the right to compensate then all of a sudden the right front brake locks
up
 and whips me to the right extreemely hard, all the way into the next lane!
by
 the time i turned the wheel to straighten out i was sliding through the
 crosswalk, past the two cars i originally saw slowiing down.  fortunately i
 hit no other vehicle and the folks in the crosswalk stopped and had a good
 laugh.  i was kind of busy with the steering wheel and looking to see who i
 was going to hit and never really noticed if the rear brakes locked  or not.

Hi Jon,
It sounds like your flexable brake lines are going bad.  Causing one of the
front brakes not to get the brake pressure until you really press hard.
Meanwhile since you have had to exert so much pressure the otherside front
brake locks up before the blocked side acuates.  When the blocked side finally
does work, it does not get all of the pressure so that side suddenly pulls
that direction.  At the least you need to replace the front two flexable brake
lines and if you can afford it replace them all to prevent more problems from
old flexable brake lines.  Eric &amp; Barb
