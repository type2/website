If you've got a regulator to try, I'd do that.  Lacking a spare regulator,
you can do a regulator-free test of the generator...disconnect the wires
from the gen, and hook your voltmeter positive lead up to D+ (where the fat
red wire came from) and the negative lead to a ground on the generator.
Alligator-clip a wire from DF on the generator (skinny green wire -- I
think) to a ground on the generator.  Run the engine briefly, at idle you
should read right around 12v, at higher RPMs it should rise quite
dramatically (as in triple).  I'm pretty sure that you need to do this test
_fast_ as it heats up the genny.  I think the procedure is in one of the
Bentleys.  Anyway, if it puts out the spec'd voltage it's probably your
regulator and not the gen.  If your problem is intermittent, though, this
test might not get it all the time...try checking it right when your red
light comes on.

Did you check the connections _at_ the regulator sitting behind the
air-cleaner?  I had the fat red wire come off once...smokin'!

Don't let that genny catch on fire.  That wouldn't be cool.  Ask how I know
:-)

&gt; Fast forward to Bishop, CA.  Stopped for gas, and upon restart the
&gt; generator
&gt; light stayed on.  Checked belt, pushed on brush springs and wiggled
&gt; connections, no change. Revved engine up and light went out and stayed
&gt; out!
