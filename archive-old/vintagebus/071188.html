can be of help Please let Rich Reader know--

If you can leverage him in any way, go for it. I'd just like him to send the
things to me. I guess what I find irritating is that he sent me this on
16.Jul:
&quot;listen just spent over hour looking for you trim dom you want it for 40.00
before i look more i really dont want to waste my time thanks bill &quot;
Kind of sounds like he's being put out about how I'm wasting all of HIS
time. I don't know. Some people are hard to figure. Let me know where you
get. Thanks!!!
You take care. More later.
