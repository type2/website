Hi Ray,
Good to hear you have been lucky so far with disc in the front and no 
pressure regulator in a bus!!  We do not have first or second hand actual info on 
this happening, but it makes sense if you follow brake history of VWs.  The 1971 
and later pressure regulator keeps the brake fluid pressure from getting to 
high in the rear brakes, this is because bus disc brakes lock up at much higher 
pressure than the drum brakes.  Since 1955 VW has always put the bigger badder 
stronger brakes in the front of thier VWs, because if the rears lock up first 
the VW will have a nasty tendancy to spin at least a 180 degrees.  Especially 
on wet or icey pavement.  Before 1956 VW brakes were the same strength front 
to rear. 

  Check a 1970s bus Bentley Official Service Manual (our's covers 1968-78), 
section 8, pages 11, 12 &amp; 13.
 &quot; 5.  Rear Brake Pressure Regulator
On 1971 and later models-those with front disc brakes and a vacuum powered 
brake servo-there is a pressure regulator in the rear brake circuit that 
prevents the rear brakes from locking when they are used to thier maximum.  This 
insures that braking effort is proportioned correctly between the front and rear 
wheels.&quot;

Perhaps if you are not using a vacuum powered brake servo there is less 
chance of one locking up the rear brakes... or perhaps you need to work on your leg 
muscles. ;-)

  Also interesting is proceedure for Testing Brake Pressure Regulator 5.1, 
step 8, &quot;With the pressure regulator still angled, increase the load on the 
brake pedal until the front brake circuit pressure reaches 1420 psi (100 kg/cm 
sq.).  At this time there should be a pressure of 786 to 929 psi (55 to 65 kg/cm 
sq.) in the rear brake circuit.&quot;
