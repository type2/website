Subject: RE: [VB] Part Suppliers

Check your mail again, my records show replys on
4/7/03 _at_ 8:06 am
4/22/03 _at_8:12 am
4/23/03 _at_10.01

I always reply either with e-mails or phone calls, have the phone bills to
prove it.

  In your e-mails to me concerning C E Safaris I informed you that it is
best to CALL C E and place an order. It is only Dave and Mandy plus 1 helper
and it is difficult for them to answer all e-mails and also make parts.

Is it just me, or is it just very difficult to get replies to e-mails. I've 
left Creative several messages about their Safari's as well as 3 to OldVolks

about the same, no replies. I guess business is too good!
