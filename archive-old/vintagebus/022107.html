Subject: 2 1967 Buses FS in GA
Mime-Version: 1.0

I have bills to pay and a couple of buses with those silly plastic 
&quot;late model&quot; tail light lenses that I hate...

If you are interested in owning either a 1967 Standard Microbus or 
a 1967 Kombi, I need to get rid of them so I can finish paying off 
my '54 Kombi before Guido comes knocking on my door.

The buses are in Marietta, Georgia and can be seen at:

I have a few others I may sell if some current deals on 2 others 
do not go through.

Buy my buses so we can all have a great holiday (my creditors 
included)!

Dave
