Hey Volks

It must be years since I last filed a trip report. My buddy Adrian and I
took a New Year's trip to Rustler's Valley in the 63 Dormobile. The bus ran
flawlessly, so not much to say about it; this is more about our trip, so
delete if you're not interested.

I started out last Friday morning by giving the dormer a valve adjust and
oil change and new points and condensor.

Then I packed up and headed around to Adrian's place to pick him up. We left
Jo'burg just after 4pm, headed for Rustler's Valley in the Eastern Free
State, an area of sandstone mountains of great scenic beauty, and
increasingly populated by artists, hippies and other city drop-outs.

The distance is about 350km (220miles), and the dormer flew along at 60mph
almost the whole way with the wind at our backs. I didn't have to change out
of fourth for any of the hills, and I drove WOT all the time, except when I
had to back off the throttle when the bus tried to go too fast on downhills
and long straights. Every now and then I'd notice that we were doing 65mph
or even 70mph and would lift right off. Even at those speeds, my 1600SP sang
sweet and smooth and cool. We arrived at Rustler's just after dark, found a
level(ish) piece of ground, parked the dormer and went off to partyartyarty
...

Rustler's is a farm set in a magnificent valley rimmed all around by
overhanging cliffs, and populated by a community of dreadlocked,
dope-smoking, tipi-dwelling &quot;alternative&quot; types.

Whatever, they put on a damn good party. We partied almost non-stop for
three days, during which I got about four hours of sleep. The day before we
arrived, a large contingent of police and army had raided the farm and
ripped out all the dope plants they could find, but didn't arrest anyone.
This seems to have scared off most of the drug dealers who usually hang out
at rave parties, judging by the number of people who approached me asking if
I had any &quot;E&quot; to sell them. And no I don't think I look like a dealer; these
guys were asking from campsite to campsite. In fact, short-haired and clean
shaven, I probably looked really straight among all the beards and dreads.

Our pattern for the next three days was dance all night, then crash out in
the shade under the dormer's tarp for a few hours sleep after dawn, then
hang out in the shade in the heat of the day, before getting up when the
afternoon starts to cool down and cruising around the camp meeting and
chatting to people, or going for walks up the mountains etc. I met lots of
cool people, danced to some cutting-edge drum'n'bass, as well as a couple of
bands playing &quot;world&quot; dance music, really good, and generally had a great
time.

My ex-wife had insisted that I pick up my children from her house at 3pm on
New Year's Day, so at 9am, after a sleepless night of partying, Adrian and I
broke camp and hit the road back to Jo'burg. And I must confess that I was
unable to pull off a stunt like that without drugs, volks, so yes, we made
several stops on route for double espressos ;-)

There was almost no traffic on the road home, and only one car overtook us
during the first hour of our journey back.Only later in the day, when we hit
the main highway back to Jo'burg, did traffic hot up, but it was still light
for the holidays, since few people travel on new years day. We were driving
partially into the wind on the way home, so we didn't move quite so fast and
fuel-efficiently as we had on the way in. But the dormer still pulled
strongly, and we made it up most of the hills without a downshift.

In the afternoon we hit two heavy thunderstorms about half an hour apart,
which necessitated slowing down. We were quite heavily buffeted by winds,
but I managed to keep the dormer in our lane the whole time. It also hailed
a bit, but luckily nothing too serious, so no damage to the pop-top.

We got to Jo'burg completely without incident, and I dropped Adrian at home
and arrived at my ex-wife's to pick up my girls at exactly 3.10pm ...
