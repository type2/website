Hi P&amp;C,
It really should be done by bleeding the farthest away cylinder first.  In 
single circuit brake systems that means the one farthest away from the driver 
seat on the rear axle.  In dual circuit brakes you do the farthest away from 
the driver seat on the front axle, followed by doing the closer one on the 
front axle.  Then do the same with the rear axle brakes.
