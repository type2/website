&gt;the threads on my left spindals steering knuckle are damaged. can these be
&gt;fixed by taking it to a machine shop or do i have to go out and buy a rebuilt
&gt;one. Spindals are expensive. so if anyone has any ideas to save me money and
&gt;get my car on the road let me know.

your machinist will have a thread chaser, if there is enough metal left to do the job...
if it is indeed a volkswagen bus, and not a &quot;car&quot; as you claim, it will probably be cheaper
if you tell him it's a part off the f *rd ... works for me... 8^)
