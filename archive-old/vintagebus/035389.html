Subject: Re:  [VB] oil cooler oddity?
To: punkerbat_at_vbe_dot_com, vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com


I recently got a little stash of parts from a friend of mine... included
in it was a doghouse style oil cooler (not a type4 cooler though) that
has the oil pressure switch right on the actual oil cooler.  It came off
of a short lived high performance engine that was in a type3.  I got the
heads, some tin, and the oil cooler.  I got the lower cylinder tin (aka
cool tin) and plan on giving this stuff a shot.
What would that oil cooler be from?  When/why/how was it used?
-  -- - -
it is a type 3 cooler.   If you put it in a upright fan shroud you cannot use 
the L deflector/hoover bit with he sender unit there.     SOme of the type3 
coolers have more fins that the reg ogs, but some are exctly the same except 
for the sender.

but I'd get the big dog  (house cooler).
