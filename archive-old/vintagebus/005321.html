.  As I recall he took a bit of a bashing from several folks on the list for
no reason other than that they couldn't understand why that was important to
Greg.

No, he did not take a bashing; he was simply given a hard time for needing
(not wanting) original glass. All in good fun. By the way, I hope he has
found it.


If you don't have what I need, or have it and don't want to sell it to me,
then ignore my post and move on.  What I, and other people, don't need are
pointless remarks about why and what we choose to do with our buses and how
that doesn't agree with your philosophy.

Dude, he was just offering up a suggestion; CHILL OUT!

Maybe I just get tired of the senseless comments that pop up every now and
then.

If that is as nasty as the comments get here on the list I still consider
this list pretty darn friendly! If you want to see some senseless comments,
go check out the forums on VW planet! A bunch of  jerk-offs have totally
abused this wonderful site that I know Everett works his tail to keep up!
