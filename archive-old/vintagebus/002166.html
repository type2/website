hmmm I'm pretty sure that was a 67 cause I rewound and saw vents above the
rear wheel wheels.

&gt;Rented Pleasantville last night and they show a
&gt;very nice '58 or earlier single cabin in a side view,
&gt;with a TV repair ad/box on the back. Very late in
&gt;the movie it is seen again and heard driving off.
&gt;It even uses a correct sounding VW engine.
&gt;
&gt;It is set in '58 and they made particular
&gt;efforts to be correct and it appears to be proper,
&gt;but the front isn't seen.  Don Knotts is driving,
&gt;whether that is good or bad is . . . . . .
