&gt; &lt;&lt; Water boils at 212 Degrees (if memory serves me correctly) and
never
&gt;  gets hotter, so if the thermo reads anything other than 212, you
&gt;  recalibrate.
&gt;   &gt;&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; Don't fall in love with this test.  Pure distilled water will boil
at 100 C.
&gt; only when the atmospheric pressure is 29.92 inches of mercury.  

For a fairly precise standard, the fluid thermometers used in science
classes are usually good to 1 degree C.  They cost about $3, but the
trick is finding them.  The easiest way is to see your friendly local
science teacher, who can be talked into loaning one if you ask really
nicely :)
