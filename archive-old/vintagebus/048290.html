You might loose points in a show with them screwed over the louvers on the 
outside of your bus.   But....you might gain some creativity points for 
mounting them on the inside of your bus with the opening UP and using them as 
magazine racks or whatever, as did a certain 'soobie' double cab owner I know 
did.   Kind of cool....
