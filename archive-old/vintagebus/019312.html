Wes, What you have there in the pic IS mesh Platinum.
The color on Wolfsburg wests site is called Mesh
Platinum, but their new repro color is a bit more
gold.

Some theorize that they developed their swatch from a
piece of old mesh platinum which sat in  a bus for
years and darkened with age. your sample there has
been concealed under a re-upholstry for several years,
preserving the true color which is more silver or,
well, &quot;Platinum&quot;.

Someone correct me if I'm wrong, are the WW interiors
from TMI?

A quick phone call to them would answer that.

Jason

The solid color of mesh grey is very dark, like
charcoal grey.

&gt; David, this confuses me because the original color I
&gt; see does not even 
&gt; resemble the &quot;mesh platinum&quot; color that Wolfsburg
&gt; West sells.  I don't 
&gt; believe the color around the skirt could go from the
&gt; tannish color of 
&gt; platinum to the silvery color it is now.
&gt; Also, I just got done stripping my front seats this
&gt; afternoon.  Their 
&gt; situation is the same as in the back, so I know the
&gt; van came with this 
&gt; color.  What's the deal?  Is platinum a silvery
&gt; color?  And if so, is the 
&gt; tannish color that WW is advertising incorrect?

&gt; 
&gt; &gt;Looks like platinum to me.  A grey might get
&gt; lighter, but it wont
&gt; &gt;generally turn toward a beige tone.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;the platinum will get darker with age, due to dirt
&gt; etc.
