Subject: Re: [VB] re:speaking of oil

Hi Kevin,

It's just the air cooled thing. It doesn't absorb and dissipate heat
as well as water and a massive metal block. So air-cooled engines are
engineered to run hotter, but that makes further demands on the oil
and engine metals.

 I don't get the anti-multi idea either...

 Do our engines really run a lot hotter than a engine made today? I'm trying
 to imagine these new cars with their 250+ HP engines running cooler then my
 ~60 hp engine.
