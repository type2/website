&gt;
&gt;I was wondering if anyone wanted to unload a 67 dimmer relay.  
&gt;I've become obsessed with making my brights work.  

Seeing is always good.

&gt;I have the mechanism on my switch for the lift up for brights.  
&gt;Is this relay hard to find or can I use any old relay from an 
&gt;auto parts store? 

I'm pretty sure this is a latching relay.  Kyle, cal4570_at_concentric_dot_net,
posted a good blurb about this the other day.  Basically, a normal
FLAPS relay is only &quot;on&quot; when the coil is powered -- if you want it
to stay on, you have to power it continuously.  The headlight relay
switches from &quot;off&quot; to &quot;on&quot; when it is powered momentarily, and then
from &quot;on&quot; to &quot;off&quot; when it is next powered momentarily.  In other
words, if you use a generic relay, you'll have to keep holding up
on your turn signal stalk all the time to get the high beams to
stay on.

&gt;Can I rebuild or fix my existing relay?

If you're sure that it's broken, and you're careful, you probably
can't break it too much worse by taking it apart - you might see
the trouble and be able to fix it.  But make sure that it's broken
before you tear into it.  :)

&gt;With a test light, I should be able to switch my brights and see
&gt;the different terminals send juice right?  Is it possible that I
&gt;wired it wrong so that the terminals dont switch?  Is there a way
&gt;to test it simply to see if it is my wiring or the relay or the
&gt;switch that is the culprit?

Yes. Yes. Yes.

&gt;My Bentley's schematic does'nt account for all the terminals.  56,
&gt;56a, 56b?  I only have 56, 56a, s, and I think one other one?
&gt;(maybe f or v)  

Probably F.  Make sure you're looking at the right diagram.  The
diagram for '63-'65 Buses, which use a floor stomp dimmer instead
of a relay, has the circle for the stomp dimmer in the same place
that the circle for the relay is on the '66 and '67 diagrams.
The floor stomp dimmer has three terminals: 56, 56a, and 56b.
The relay has five terminals in '66 (56, 56a, F, S, and 30) and
four in '67 (56, 56a, F, and S).

Here's what to do.  You should have four wires at the headlight
relay, hooked up as follows:

Wire color             Terminal  Function
fat white/black stripe   56    headlight feed
fat white                56a   high beam
fat yellow               F     low beam
skinny brown             S     wire to switch in turn signal

If yours aren't hooked up like this, hook them up like this
and try it.  If they still don't work, do this.

Quick Version:
56 should be hot with headlight switch on
56a should be hot with low beams on
F should be hot with high beams on
Test light between 56 and S should be on whenever the
turn signal stalk is held back and off when stalk is
not held

Long Version:

Get a voltmeter or test light (or steal a bulb from your dome
light).  Disconnect the white/black stripe wire connected to 56.
Ground one end of your test light and touch the other to this
wire, and turn the headlight switch on.  If the light comes
on, so far so good.  If not, you have a break in this white/black
stripe wire or trouble with your headlight switch.  Turn the
headlight switch off.

Now, pull off the skinny brown wire connected to S as well.  
Connect one end of the test light to the white/black stripe wire
and the other end to the skinny brown wire.  Turn the headlight
switch on.  Your test light should flash whenever you pull up
on the turn signal lever.  If it doesn't, either of the brown
wires (relay S to turn signal switch or turn signal switch
to ground) are bad, or the turn signal switch is bad.  If
the light flashes, you're still good.  Turn the headlight
switch off.

Pull off the fat yellow wire and hold the terminals on it
and the fat white/black stripe wire together.  Turn on
your headlight switch and you should have low beams.  If
not, either your headlight switch can't supply the juice,
you have one or two blown low-beam fuse(s), there is a poor
contact at the fuse box, or there is an open in one of the
three yellow wires: relay to fuse box, fuse box to LH
headlight, fuse box to RH headlight.  If you have low
beams, you're still good.  Turn the headlight switch off.

Finally, pull off the fat white wire and hold the terminals
on it and the fat white/black stripe wire together.  Turn on
your headlight switch and you should have high beams.  If
not, either your headlight switch can't supply the juice,
you have one or two blown high-beam fuse(s), there is a poor
contact at the fuse box, or there is an open in one of the
three white wires: relay to fuse box, fuse box to LH
headlight, fuse box to RH headlight.  If you have high
beams, you're still good.  If you have high beams, the blue
lamp in your speedometer should also be on.  If it isn't,
there's a bad ground at the speedometer, a burned out bulb,
or an open in the blue wire from the bulb to the fuse box.
Turn the headlight switch off.

If you've made it this far and all the tests have passed,
and when you hook up all the wires to the right terminals
on the relay, it doesn't work, your relay is most likely
busted.
