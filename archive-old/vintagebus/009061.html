Hey everyone,

when did the side view mirrors switch from the round type to the elephant
ear ones?

I'd like to buy a original round driver's side mirror with the arm, I
believe that's correct for my '62.
The mirror that is currently on the driver's side is an elephant ear one
stamped VWOA on the back
but I would guess It's not original, since there was a nice rectangular
truck mirror pop-riveted to the
passenger side.

If anyone would like to sell me an original round mirror, with arm, let me
know:

also-- I'm considering buying one of those one person brake bleeding pumps
&gt;from RMMW,
do you think it's worth the $$ ?  I read the recent brake bleeding thread,
but I thought that this
would make the process easier, has anyone used one of these?

Thanks.
