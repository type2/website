Subject:  RE: [VB] Rebuilt Steering Box Sources? (Prices?)

OK,

Having just rebuilt a steering box I've gotta ask
why are the rebuilts so expensive? They're worth a fortune
changeover here in Australia as well.   

Really, the 'commonly' worn parts are roller and ball bearings which can
be found etc etc.  Not even caged bearings as such - hold em in
with grease like an old style bicycle crank. The worm and spline can have
wear but this can be adjusted out by adjusting the worm when fitting the new
bearings....

The only hard to get part might by the bush that the actual 
pivot arm sits in - but its just a fit and ream job (like a center pin...)

Is it the 'mystic' factor?  It's not hard to do.  Check a workshop
manual if you have one....
