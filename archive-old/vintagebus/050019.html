Subject: Re: [VB] Fluted Bus headlights - The Merc option

&gt;There are headlight assemblies used on Merc trucks of the '70s era that
&gt;appear to be an exact match to those on our buses. I checked with a truck
&gt;part dealer in South Africa and it seems that they are still available. They
&gt;told me that lenses and seals could be got sepperately. I think I will buy
&gt;up their entire stock, put them up on ebay and retire to the Cayman islands


WOW!  Mercedes headlights on my bus, w/o modifications?  Sounds pretty
classy.  Please update us if you actually test out your theory, if you're
not too busy drinking mint juleps and playing in the surf...

Late bus owners are even more fortunate.  They can use Mercedes wheels with
the small 5 bolt pattern, and then they can strut sround bragging, &quot;My bus
has Mercedes wheels and a Porsche engine&quot;...
