Hiya volks.

  I could use some help trying to figure this out. I'm after a bus for sale
that belongs to a friend's uncle, and it's supposedly a '64 or '65.
However, I've been reading the bus FAQ at Thom Fitzpatrick's VintageBus
site and I asked my friend for the chassis nr. to cross-reference with the
chart found on this document (by the way, great site, Thom). He sent me a
number which he says is the chassis' number, but it is not the same kind
as the ones on the chart. The number he sent me is 1173454. What is this
number ? Engine ? Or could it really be a chassis reference ? Thanks in
advance for any light on this subject.
