I bet a NACA duct would work better for that purpose.

Look at all the modern fast cars with oil coolers and intercoolers - they don't 
have scoops protruding outside the body - they're either let into the sides, 
or have openings in the front.

Anyone volunteering to cut a NACA duct into the side of their bus?  It would
have to be a barndoor in order to be a valid test subject.
