Subject: RE: RE: [VB] Venting a bit &lt;long&gt;

John writ:
&quot;I take comfort in knowing the fact that in 6 months or a year from now,
those &quot;others&quot; will be long gone, but I'd bet you a sink from a 75 Westy
that everybody I have mentioned in this post will still be here!!!&quot;

Well said!  It seems a lot of the people who make the community great are
here year after year.  Heck I have been in the VW scene for 6 years and
still feel like a newbie sometimes :)

The people in the bus scene for the wrong reasons will be gone after a
couple of years.  After all St. Muir's #7th rule of VW ownership is &quot;Love&quot;.
Without the love of yourself, others, tools, and your car you are destined
for a miserable journey.  In my opinion you can tell a lot about a person by
the manner in which they treat their tools.

Just as a side note, I think John is the luckiest bus parts trader/giver I
have ever seen!  Heck he gave me and a friend (owns a '73 Westi) a '75 Westi
carcass/parts for free last year.  John is a great example of how karma
comes full circle in the VW community.

 
Happy Journeys,
Adrian S. Pillow

On the gravytrain to biscuitville!
