Part of my order came today and of course the rods and crank are backordered
(I just love it when a business back orders parts on you and doesn't tell
you.  The rest of the parts do you no good if you don't get all you
ordered!!!)

The piston and cylinder set I received is either going to get returned for
credit or I can offer to anyone else who would like them.

I paid $159.50 plus shipping and this is for a MAHLE set of 90.5's brand new
and I didn't even open the box.  I can send these back for credit but
figured if someone on the list would like a set for a good price (just look
around), I can ship them off pronto.  It may even be a better deal if you
live closer to me.  I'm currently in Beatrice, NE 68310
