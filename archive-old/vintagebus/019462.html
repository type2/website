&lt;B.T.W.,
I heard the guy who had the NOS bumper at OCTO marked &quot;SOLD&quot; with a 1000$ 
price tag was pulling our leg.
I heard from around the bend it sold for 400 bucks.&gt;

People like this should be shot!  This type of hype does nothing but F up this entire hobby.

Still high but........
Hopefully this marks a downward trend.


Two Pomona's ago I picked up a set for a LOT less than $250.  They did need the knob though.
