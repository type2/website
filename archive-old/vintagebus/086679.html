&gt;&gt;&gt; need advice, the switch has always worked fine, but one  day all it would 
do is make a click when I tryed to start. It did this several  times, so I 
gave up. A few dayes later it worked fine. Still is working. Do I  need to 
replace it. I would hate to go somewhere, and it not start  again.  &lt;&lt;&lt;


Hi Bob,
Thing is about your problem could be one or more problems causing  your 
symptom, and not even be your ignition switch!!  Get a multimeter from  your local 
hardware store.  Set it on a DC range that works for your  voltage.  Check 
voltage at battery posts, and then work your way through  the wiring up front and 
back to coil, starter solenoid, and taillights.   Check vintagebus_dot_com for 
your year of wiring diagram in color.  You want  the voltage drop between 
battery and these points to be less than .3  (3/10) volts.  We have easily gotten 
these to less than  .1(1/10) volt.  As you go through all these connections take 
them  apart for a good cleaning, dielectric greasing, and tightening.  Look 
into  the type2_dot_com library for the headlight repair article, and soldering  
together the brass clips in each socket of the fuse box is a must to  prevent 
voltage drops there.
  Do not forget to remove and clean both the battery to  body ground cable, 
and the tranny to body ground cable for a good cleaning,  tightening of both 
cable ends and places they connect to.
  If that does not do the trick check starter mounting nuts, and bolt  to 
make sure they are tight.  Failing that you might need to remove the  starter and 
either just replace it or the brushes inside, or even the  starter solenoid.
