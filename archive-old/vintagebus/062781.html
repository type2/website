Subject: A story of Roadcow's help/ LONG

	 Well as most of you know the famous Road Cow blew a tranny in
Amarillo, Texas on it's return journey home from a cross country VW show,
bus tow marathon.

     It started with the COW towing a Bay back to Kansas or the like for a
new and very happy new bus owner. Them from there on another journey to
another VW show where a bus  (not the cow) started having engine problems so
the COW towed the bus and it's owners to the show and back, something like a
1000 miles rt or something like that.

     In the mean time the COW's owner ( Britt) helped numerous people either
work on or he did the work to keep a few more buses on the road. Britt (the
COW's owner) then flew back home to Cali. in wait of the anticipation of
going back to Kansas to pick the COW up
.
     In Britt's absence he let others use the cow to attend 2 other VW's
shows in the land of OZ before flying back to pick her up then drive back
home attending the CLASSIC weekend along the way (of course busavanning with
friends to make sure THEY had no problems) towing a 63 flip seat WESTY back
from Iowa for me.

     O ya I forgot to mention that Britt flew into Kansas, picked up the COW
that had be left at the airport for him by friends and proceeded to drive 3
more hours to IOWA to pick up my WESTY arriving there late in the evening,
hooking up my bus then proceeding back to Kansas. THEN when Britt got to
Kansas he proceeded to help Bryant install a brand new engine in his bus and
then helping another person (I forgot who it was) repair there bus engine
before heading out to CALI, with my bus in tow when his trans blew,

    Would you believe it that it blew in front of a giant fiberglass COW in
front of a steak house! Maybe the Roadcow was lonely and wanted to hang with
it's own breed for a while.

    Now this is where busdom, Karma or whatever you call it comes in. I get
the phone call the COW is broken. Post to the list, which in turn gets
forwarded to all BUS LIST and the e-mails started, I was amazed at how many
offers of help came in in such a short time. I then called Rex Rogers who
lives in San Angelo Texas, I guess it's about a 1000 miles from Amarillo and
explain the situation to Rex who in turn promptly gets on the phone and
finds  Britt and the COW help in Amarillo. First a guy there loans Britt his
SB to use to get around in while the COW is waiting to get fixed, another
guy comes and loans Britt another floor jack and then a third offers help.
Mind you none of these people have ever met Britt, but are willing to help
another VW'ber out..

    As the search continued for a trans it turned out that Richard Kimbrough
(Rustybus fame) had a tranny at his house in Phoenix. He got the trans
packed and on a Greyhound bus and the trans should be to Britt and the
injured COW by 11;45 today!!!!  The cow should be back on the road by 2 or 3
this afternoon and Britt and the COW should catch up to us Friday morning to
all go to OCTO together!!!!
!
   I would really like to THANK all that helped and offered help in this
situation to help out the COW and Britt. Especially Rex Rogers for hooking
Britt up with people out in Amarillo, Richard for getting a trans fixed and
to Britt and the COW for being the kind of person he is.  

   If there was a list award for the BUS DRIVER of the year it should go to
Britt, there is no one else like him I know out there!
