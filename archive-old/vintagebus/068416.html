Subject: Re: [VB] Thermodynamics

It wasn't a hot day, but the 65 westy was up to operating temp when I got 
back to Oly from somewhere, it is raining copiously.   On the way home I get 
off the freeway and onto the park way.  
Suddenly, what's that up ahead!!!!  a puddle!
I slow down to 25 mph, but let off the brake before I enter the water.   In 
fact, Grass Lake had risen and flowed over the road.   

I felt the water pounding under my feet, pushing up against the floor, 
flowing up through the rust hole.  Hmm, It was deeper that I imagined.  The 
bus is further slowed.   Suddenly the windsheild defigger becomes a 
windsheild fogger as steam is blown out of it!   I clear the other end of the 
puddle and wipe the inside of the windsheilds and open the windows.

Anyway, even though the engine was practically  placed in a big puddle of 
water while at operating temp, the heads did not crack.

hm the heads do run about 350 with foot on the gas

&lt;&lt; Given the air cooled design, which I am told runs at a head temp of around
 650F - what keeps this from running down a hot dry road and suddenly up
 ahead it has been raining for awhile and you encounter large puddles. How
 does this extremely hot motor cope with copious amounts of cold water
 without cracking the block? Or it already common knowledge this is bad?
