&gt; &gt; does anyone know what ever happened to david koresh's bus from waco?
sure,
&gt; &gt; it was a bay window, but think of the cool factor of owning such an
&gt; &gt; infamous/famous bus.  it didn't burn in the fire, so i guess it could be
&gt; &gt; &quot;restored&quot; if it still exists.  also, what about kevorkian's
bus--another
&gt; &gt; bay window.  did OJ have any vw's?  what about robert blake?
