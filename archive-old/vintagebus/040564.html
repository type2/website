 Who are you people and WHY don't you live near me?  I am always looking for
36hp stuff but can never find it (at a reasonable price).  I paid $100 for a
36hp minus carb, air cleaner and Optima battery.  Some people have all the
luck.

&gt; Last month I sold a 36hp as advertised on this list to
&gt; a local for $150.00 ~complete with carb aircleaner and
&gt; stale air boxes! Had to almost pay the guy to buy it.
&gt; In fact I did bribe him by throwing in a bad 12v
&gt; Optima battery with BAP receipt so he could go trade
&gt; it in and pay the $70 core charge and get a new one.
