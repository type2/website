Subject: Seattle old-timer has to move, lots of projects (63 westy, 66 dor
	mobile, 64 kombi)

One of the old-timers stopped by my house to tell me that he has his house
up on the market and real estate agent wants the yeard cleared.

Typical story, wants out of this weekend... hasn't touched the stuff in
multiple years.  Lots of projects.  DO NOT EXPECT THESE THINGS TO BE READY
TO ROLL!  There is some good stuff, but not for the light hearted:

   63 Westy
   66 Dormobile
   64 Kombi
   67 Westy -- but really gone, only good for steering box and front beam.
Those parts free if you agree to cut the rest of the bus up for scrap metal.

He WANTS TO TRADE, all of it for 1 running VW?  I asked him about cash, he
seemed more interested in trade... but he is also motivated to get rid of
the stuff now!

I wish I had time and resources... but I don't even have a digital camera
right now so I can't do a lot to help out.  I don't want to post his phone
number, please email me and I'll send it to you.

Some of you may know this guy, his name is Allen and he lives off exit 4 of
I405 in Renton.

He also said he had some older (1970's?) dodge trucks, one without engine...
wants to get rid of them too... ready to deal.

E-mail me for his phone number.
