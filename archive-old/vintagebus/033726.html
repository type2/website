Subject: type 3 oil cooler test

  I just had a local customer who installed the tight fin type 3 oil cooler
in his bus. He is running the oil temp sender from the cooler and in 110
degree heat, cruising at 60-65 mph, his oil temp out of the cooler never got
higher then 190 degrees. Our next test will be to run a VDO dipstick sender
and a sump sender to get the oil temp as it is before cooling. This will
tell us how much the oil is getting cooled.
