Wow, what a day I put in yesterday.  The weather was finally really nice for
a change and managed to get the front beam installed.  I never did really
hit any snags - I just took my time and kept a steady pace - breaking only
for errand running, and mealtimes (which were ham sandwiches and chip
courtesy of my 80 year old grandmother - she still makes the best sandwiches
around!)  A nice touch was that my MP3 player I made (a P90 based system)
was toted along and I was able to listen to my favourite tunes from about
11:00 to 5:00 without one repeat.  That was really cool.

So on to the bus.  Well I pretty much covered the basics.  I went from a
beam that was done out to the linkpins and that was it.  I now have a fully
installed beam.  This entailed such things as putting on the backing plates,
new Varga wheel cylinders, the brake line that connects the 2, the brass
adjusting stars (with plenty of anti-seize), new shoes, springs, brake
grease, and my custom made DOT approves SS brake lines.  Next was to install
the drums.  I pretty much told you all that I put in new bearings and races
as well as new seals.  One little addendum was that after POR15ing the
drums, the POR ran into the lug holes.  I've run into this before and since
I don't have a tap that size, I took a lug bolt and modified it with a nice
slot down the side.  It could actually stand to have a couple more ground
into it.  What this does is act like thread cleaner - allowing the crap in
the threads to funnel out and stay into the grooves.  I used PLENTY of oil
and the impact wrench to run the lug in and out of each of the 10 lug holes
and within about 10 minutes they were all cleaned.

I went ahead and installed the washer on the outer bearing, then the first
nut, loc tab, second nut, snugged it up and installed the dust cap.  When I
did the 2nd drum, my loc tab was all busted and distorted so I made a new
one out of some scrap aluminum.  It won't have near the re-use capability of
soft steel one but this will work until I can get a new one.

To fritter away a little time, I found some WCM packages with new pedal pads
and rubber sealing boots for the clutch and brake pedals so I took them off,
installed the rubber, and put them back on - looks great now!

I order to ease the installation of the beam, I took my largest tap and ran
it through all 8 beam bolt securing holes.  This took some time as they were
really rusty and crappy but once that was done, I called my brother and he
came over and helped me install the beam.  He prompty cross threaded a bolt
but I was able to fix it by running the tap through from the backside.  He
felt bad about it but I didn't say anything.  I just repaired it and moved
on - at least he came over and helped me install the beam.

I followed the Bentley as to how the locating washers were supposed to be
oriented and torqued all the bolts to 72 ft. lbs.  (max. Bent spec.)  I
routed the clutch cables up through the beam as well as the clutch cable.
Next I installed the drag link and made sure that I held it up to the old
one to adjust for proper length.  I installed it and then using my tape
measure and keeping in mind John Muir's advice about 1/8&quot; toe-in, I measured
for a 1/16&quot; toe in at the drum (the rim-based measurement would exaggerate
this 1/16&quot; measurement to 1/8&quot; or possibly even more) and just hand snugged
the adjustable tie rod.  I put on the steering wheel and it turns exactly
2.5 turns from stop to stop and centers with the wings straight across the
width of the bus.  I'm sure I'm close but will probably have to fine tune
the front end once the tires are on and I get to rolling around with it.

That pretty much finished the night.  It was about 12:30 or so when I
started to clean up the shop and head for home.  The reason why the previous
post came over this morning instead of last night was my brother was still
up on the net so I typed a post and hit the sack.  Then when I called this
morning, the message got sent.

Anyway, I did take the dc20 and got some low quailty shots of the beam
laying on the saw horses so you can see what a freshly rebuilt beam looks
like.  Underneath the front of the bus, it looks AWESOME - no rust-through -
just black POR15.  Now I've only got the rest of the bottom to do. :-( :-)

More later...
