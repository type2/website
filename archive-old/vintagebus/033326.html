Hi Bob,
Glad to help!  Make sure to tach your RPM in each forward gear and write down 
where each has 1,500 and 3,000 RPM.  We should be able to figure out what 
ring and pinion you have from this info.  You really never want to go below 
1,500 due to lugging, and only above 3,000 for only a minute or two 
especially during the summer to prevent overheating.   Hopefully they did not 
put in a higher fourth gear than the stock .82 for bus and Ghia or you are 
going to have too large a gap between third and fourth.  Resulting in too 
high of RPM in third or way too low RPM in fourth inside of this gap.  
Instead hopefully they installed a 3.75 R&amp;P instead of the stock 4.375 or 
4.125 R&amp;Ps.    Eric&amp;Barb
