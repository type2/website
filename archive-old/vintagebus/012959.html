 OK heres the deal... Weve located a bus, but it has
no trans in it, '66 if I remember right. Interior
gutted, but thats no prob... Seems I remember someone
on the list that had to move a bus w/o trans so they
built a &quot;dolly&quot; to bolt to the wishbone... considering
the bus is in N Oklahoma, &amp; Im in Fort Worth, its
gonna be hard to get the correct plans for the build:(
Now were not gonna tow it, this is just for it to roll
to get it up on the trailer &amp; to get it out of the SOs
sight when I get it to the house:) Please Pmail if you
know of the person, or are the person who did this.
 Also, I have two B*g swingaxles complete hub to hub,
if we hunted down bus axles &amp; redux boxes, is it
possible to install em on that trans? I like to try to
use parts already aquired. Buses are rare here, parts
even rarer:( Did I mention were dirt poor?
TIA for any help
Later
