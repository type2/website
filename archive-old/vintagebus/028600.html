Subject: found rebuild kits

hello,
I know a few of you were interested in the wheel cylinder rebuild kits I
was looking for....well... BFY Obsolete Parts found some for me.  I
ordered 8 fronts and 4 rears.  He doesn't know if he can get the rear
rebuild kits though...shouldn't matter too much as the rear cylinders
aren't that expensive new.  They can however get the fronts.  I don't
know what years they span, but they are for my 62....so whatever years
of the bus use the same front wheel cylinders as the 62 does...

just thought I'd let you all know
