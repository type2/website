Hello.
I get the occasional 'Hey you sent this to me p-mail instead of to the
list'.  I'm really sending it to the list.  I use Blind Copy often so
that others don't see a pile of addresses.  When I post it to the list,
it seems to look like I sent it to you directly. Be assured this is not
the case, I have few list members in my address book, and I'm NOT
singling you out.  I get used to blind copying so there's no need to
'double post' to the list.  I will TRY to remember to not post BCC.
Dave
