&gt; You can replace the front coupler and bushing without pulling the tranny,

Hi Matt,
Fortunitly not!  We have done this replacement on VW buses from Clara's 1953 
to at least as late on our 1963 buses.  We just make sure to pop the tranny 
in first or third and then once the coupler bolts are loosened swing the 
shifter to where it would be in third or fourth gear.  At worse one might 
have to remove the shifter and then move the shift linkages forward.
