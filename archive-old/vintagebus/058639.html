Subject: Re: [VB] 12v gas gauge...


Hi karl, i'm interested in how you got your gas gauge working again. I think 
my sender unit in the tank is messed up. here is what it is doing. When i 
fill the tank up all the way it registers half (most of the time) and slowy 
goes down as i drive it until it hits empty. then i usually fill it up just 
to be safe and it only takes half fuel.  So basically it never registers 
more than half.
Any help would be great.
thanks
john.

&gt;
&gt;Id like to start out by thanking Karl for the sending unit he gave me!
&gt;It sure helped a lot. Using that sender I was able to get my gas gauge
&gt;working but it's a 6v gauge and I really don't like using the voltage
&gt;drop units. Does anyone know a place to get a new or used 12v gauge that
&gt;works with a stock sender? I have seen some new ones for sale but they
&gt;require a VDO sender that doesn't look stock to me. Any suggestions?
&gt;Thanks!
&gt;TJ
