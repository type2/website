Hi Steve,
From 1955- early 64 the brake system stayed the same.  Then in later 64-70 
the shoes and drums were widened to make the braking area larger.  This meant 
that the slave cylinder (Wheel cyinders.) since it had to hold and push the 
shoe at the center point of it's width the slave cylinder had to be given a 
thicker base to offset it to proper relation to the brake shoe center.  The 
cylinder diameters of both the slave cylinders and master cylinders did not 
change from 1955-70.   Eric&amp;Barb
