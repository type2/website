Subject: RE: [VB] cleaning the engine compartment

I got some industrial degreaser cleaner at Costco (they also have it at Home
Depot) in the floor cleaning supply section. I don't dilute it just spray it
on straight and let it soak, then hose it off. Works great and is 7 dollars
a gallon!

ronnie   the original! not the other

Subject: [VB] cleaning the engine compartment


wondering what cleaners folks have had good luck with cleaning the gunk out
of the engine compartment. I was able to get most of it with simple green
and hot water but some of it is just to tough to scrub off. I'm a little
paranoid of the oven cleaners as I'm trying to preserve whats left of the
original paint.
