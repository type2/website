Subject: re:solenoid #30 terminal broken

You should be able to pull the starter and solenoid without pulling the
motor. I would think that the PO just changed to 12V and kept the 6V
starter&amp; solenoid-at least that has been recommended to me.

Anyway-take your solenoid to your supply house.

Actually as you live around here we don't really have any decent supply
houses...try double checking your solenoid &amp; I would imagine you can find
some sort of marking on it...

Good luck...
