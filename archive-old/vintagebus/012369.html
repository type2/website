The
&gt; words KDF Enterprises (I suspect the manufactur) are below a round
logo
&gt; with the old cogwheel VW logo and the words Kraft Durch Freude (joy
&gt; through work??).  

Actually, &quot;Strength through Joy&quot;.  This was the name of the
recreational arm of the German Labor organization, which was in turn a
part of the Party organization.  KdF did stuff like arrange holidays,
recreational events, concerts, etc. for workers.  

Money was needed to finance the VW factory, so the Party diverted
funds from KdF, rationalizing that possession of a Volkswagen would
allow workers to recreate more easily.  This made the VW a KdF
enterprise, and the VW was christened the &quot;KdF-wagen&quot; by Hitler, who
also called the new city to be built next to the factory &quot;KdF-stadt&quot;. 
Nobody outide the Party really used these names, preferring
&quot;Volkswagen&quot; and &quot;Auto-stadt&quot; to the cumbersome &quot;KdF-...&quot; terms.

The &quot;KdF&quot; logo wouldn't have appeared on any Bus-related item, as the
bus wasn't conceived until well after WWII, and the KdF organization
and name ended with the Allied victory.  I think that KdF Enterprises
is an US company specializing in VW memorabilia.

And yes, I'm _really_ enjoying &quot;Small Wonder&quot; :)
