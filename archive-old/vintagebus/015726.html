Putting the gauges in the spot where the radio goes sounds like a decent idea,
as long as no modificatiosn need to be done to the radio hole.

I think someone on the list wrote in about putting their gauges where their
ashtray was...which i think is a better idea-for me anyway. This is because I
don't smoke, and I still use my original radio.
