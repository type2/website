Yep... wife and I went to a local VW dealer and wife started to speak to a
sales person about a new beetle.  I went back to the parts department and
looked for windshield wipers.  They did not carry them and said that the 64
/ 21 Window is not supported.

Went back to the sales man and told them that they lost a sell over a pair
of windshield wipers.

Pissed the sales man went back to parts then went to the sales manager...
and he offered to pay for NOS set himself.  No sale!

&gt; &gt; I agree!  This needs to be voiced loud and clear. VWOA/AG needs to hear
&gt; &gt; also.  Wonder why VW trends and Hot VW's don't get hassled??
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Boycotting their NEW products is the only thing they will listen too
though.
&gt;
&gt; Well, as a matter of fact my wife is interested in a new car and she
&gt; really likes the Passat wagon.  Of course, she also likes a Subaru
&gt; Forester and with VW's attitude about the aircooled folks in general and
&gt; URLs in particular we are very likely to end up with the Japanese Boxer.
&gt; If Volkswagen was so concerned with trademark they should do what many
&gt; corporations have done and change their name to a coined word that has no
&gt; meaning other than the name of their company.
