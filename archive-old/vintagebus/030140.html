Subject: testing generator &amp; regulator (65 samba resto)

(for 65 samba restoration)

While i did have the motor running i did notice that my generator light
never went off.  That means either generator, regulator or wiring.

Q. #1 The factory main cable from the battery (+) went both to the
starter and to the remote regulator in 1965.  I have not been able to
find a split cable that looked right so i went from the battery straight
to the starter with the main cable.  I then brought a cable back from
the battery to the regulator.  Any problems electrically with doing
that?

Q. #2  I did take the regulator top off and check it out.  Asside from
some flakey clear stuff comming off the thin wire wraped in a square on
the bottom all looked OK.  I did clean up the contacts a little.  Might
that cause a charging problem?

Q.#3.  How else could i check out the generator &amp; regulator?

Thanks
MAtt
