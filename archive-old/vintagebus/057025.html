Subject: Re: [VB] Child Car Seats and Ventage Bus

The Z Bed in a '65 Westy is secured to the floor with
two bolts. When i was dating a girl who had a child i
used those bolts to mount seatbelts. I am not sure
what you would do with two of them rascals though!

&gt; Hello all,
&gt; 
&gt; Am fairly new to the list and have a question that
&gt; can
&gt; be answered (hopefully) via the list or pmail.
&gt; 
&gt; I don't currently have a bus (egads! but wait I've
&gt; owned any number of busses, bugs and 3's in the past
&gt; so don't kick me...) but plan to rejoin the ranks
&gt; soon.  My hope and desire is to come back by getting
&gt; a
&gt; westy of the 60 to 65 vintage.  Issue I have is that
&gt; I
&gt; also have two kids still using car seats.  I would
&gt; have no way to strap the seats and hence the kids
&gt; down.  Are there any other vintage Westy owners that
&gt; also travel with toddlers and therefore deal with
&gt; the
&gt; car seat issue?  If so, I'd like to hear how you
&gt; came
&gt; up with seatbelts or other restraints for the child
&gt; car seat.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks much and sorry for the extended post!
&gt;
