&gt; Well, I got my tranny back from the fix-it guy.  The centre section doesn't 
&gt; leak anymore, which is good, I guess.  Except from one spot near the very 
&gt; front where there are 3 little holes that look like there should be plugs 
&gt; in them... would that be just a plastic plug or???

Hi Diana,
Are those plugs on the forward right side of the tranny just behind the nose 
cone seam?  If so those are probably the retaining plugs that hold in the 
springs and small bearing like indent balls that hold your shifting in gear.  
No springs, indent balls or plugs and no gear will stay engaged and gear oil 
will pour out when running.  Check section H-6 pages 8-9 of the bus workshop 
manual for these.  

&gt; 2.  he was supposed to rebuild the reduction boxes, but he only changed ONE 
&gt; (upper) bearing on each side.  At least they did have broken cages but I 
&gt; suspect the rest are shot too.  I didn't realize at the time that there are 
&gt; 3 bearings in each box, I thought there were only two.  He said he couldn't 
&gt; get at the lower bearings because he couldn't get the frost plugs out.  How 
&gt; hard is that really?  I guess I need to pull the redux boxes back apart and 
&gt; fix them properly... looks like a lot of special tools are required 
&gt; according to the official manual...

There are four per side.  The only special tool you need is a welded to pull 
the freeze plugs out or for welding the hole/s you put in the freeze plugs 
when using a body puller to remove them and intend on reusing them.  Either 
way make sure to scrape out the crevice between the RGBs and the freeze plugs 
with a sharp knife like an Exacto to remove all rust/grit/gunk that will 
otherwise wedge them in place.

&gt; 3.  the axle boots are wrecked.  My local VWflaps sells one size which they 
&gt; claim fits both bugs and busses, altho last time I tried to use one of 
&gt; these I could never get it to seal totally (air could be heard entering and 
&gt; exiting the boot when I squeezed it) no matter how much I tried and upon 
&gt; examination it appears the new boots are just a teensy bit smaller... is 
&gt; this the usual or???

VW was both smart and frugal by using parts that were strong enough to work 
on differant model type of thier automobiles.  The swing axle boot fits all 
VWs made up to 1967 model year.  To seal the seamed boots properly VW used a 
sealant, check section H-5, page 5.  We use high temp silicon sealant lightly 
coated on the joining faces of the boot/s and make sure to postion the seam 
on the axle so to be about 30 degrees from TDC.  This reduces the flex stress 
on the seams due the flexing here of the axle tubes.
