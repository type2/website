&lt;&lt; Does anyone know where the seat belt mounting points are
 supposed to be, in the rear of a double cab?

Hi Eric,
We took a look at our 1962 instruction manual from Hickok seat belts and there
is nothing about the rear installation of seat belts for any bus.  The main
thing you should keep in mind is that you want the seat belts mounted in solid
sheet metal and have at least 2&quot; outer dia. washers on the opposite side of
the sheet metal from the belts to prevent the nuts/bolts from pulling through
the metal during a accident by spreading this force over a much bigger area of
the VW body.    Eric &amp; Barb
