maybe for the sigla vs sekurit glass purpose, the 57-63 kombis are considered 
passenger buses

56 and earlier had the large logo SEKURIT glass, though I'm not sure exactly 
when that changed.

also, there are M codes listed for getting sekurit, or sigla glass.   never 
saw them on a vehicle I dont think, though.

euro buses came with sekurit all the time, I think, even the windsheilds.  I 
got some sekurit windsheilds out of a 67 euro bus.

ya Thom, why not put a survey on your M code collection site
