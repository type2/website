Everybus 2004

With our impending addition to the family Everybus was going to be
one of our only trips this year. We were all up to making it count. A
little poking from Ric &amp; Chris was all it took to decide to take
another day off work and leave earlier. I had spend the earlier part
of the week working on hooking up some loose ends I had not finished
and getting the dual screen dvd mounted. Tuesday we also loaded up the
bus with all the heavy items (so Steph did not have to lift heavy
stuff). By the end of the night everything except clothes were loaded.
This included the two three wheelers for the Everybus 500 and one well
used small bicycle. 

Wednesday after school and at nearly the end of the work day Steph
rolls in with the kids in tow to start our first trip of the year. The
plan was to drive east on I-40 head through Knoxville, and then up to
I-81 towards Roan Mtn. to meet up with Ric &amp; Chris at the Doc Ric
homestead. We followed the plan exactly except for the timing part.
It was near midnight when we finally found the house. I'd love to
blame the directions for being so late, but we just plain ran behind
schedule. Oh well, what do you expect with 5 people in a 66 Bus :) I
found Ric asleep in his recliner and after waking him up we all got
settled in for the sleep before the final leg of the trip on Thursday.
It was a peaceful sleep until one of the dogs decided that barking at
nothing was a great idea at 4 in the morning. Saffron (the dog) did
have one addition to the entire weekend, it was an ongoing joke about
the barking.

I woke to the sound of my house in 10 years. Many teenagers getting
ready for a day at school. Quite frightening, but still a few years
off for me. Later that morning Chris and Emma woke from a sound sleep
in the bus to join us. By sound I mean loud barking dog. We spend the
rest of the morning having breakfast with Chris and Emma at Bob's
Dairy land, easily the best cup of coffee in all of Roan Mountain.
After a good cup of joe, our small we arrived back at Ric's home to
find him packing up Babcia. Unfortunately after Ric started up the bus
she started to leak like a sieve out of the drivers side. A small
amount of panic and we discovered it was simply a leaky valve cover.
It was popped off and reset. It was still leaking a bit but no problem
whatsoever getting to the animal hospital to meet with Travis and
Eddie. We hung around till they showed up checking out the clinic and
eating donuts. Ric also finished fixing his leak and had no more
problems the rest of the weekend.

Very shortly after their arrival we were off down the road. Our path
was down some east TN roads and down the Blueridge Parkway. We were
near the Parkway when I mentioned something about a photo opp. No
sooner had I got the word out of my mouth than we were steered off the
road for Chris to take a photo. Back onto the road we made good time
down the parkway and onto 421. Somewhere along the way Ric's CB
antenna broke so he was cut off from all communication. Our plan was
to meet up with MUD in wilkesboro, but they made it down the road a
bit further. After our stop in Wilkesboro Lurch decided it wouldn't
start. Chris crawled under to poke and prod. I'm not sure what he did,
but it started again and we were off down the road. We met up with MUD
and the family and added Tinkertoy and a dasher to the carabus. The
rest of the trip was very uneventful down the interstate. We arrived
at Hagen-Stone late in the afternoon and set up camp, right next to
the registration desk.  The rest of the day Thursday was spent
visiting with old friends and meeting new ones.

That night the temp dropped quite a bit and since we had a butt tent
on the end of the bus and I had not brought a heater, we all got quite
cold. Also some time in the night Stryder somehow got out of the
zipped up tent and started to cry outside. I woke and got him back in
the bus, and spent the rest of the night getting a bit cold in the
sleeping bag. It was a nice night, just a bit cold. That morning I
awoke to the smell of pancakes, maple syrup and canadian bacon (ham).
OK not really. Chloe and me had already been up for a few hours when
the pancakes went on the flattops. We spent the morning warming up
when the sun rose more and I hit the miners coffee w/ my regular
coffee. during this time I opened the bus up to get the rest of the
kids out and fortunately looks can't kill. I was greeted with a look
that could cut through metal from Steph. Apparently she was much more
miserable that I was the night before. After she woke up her attitude
took a 180 and everything was fine.  About time the sun really started
to rise the Canadian crew got busy making fantastic pancakes for the
entire camp. There were many flavors to choose from, and that maple
syrup was to die for.  Whatever campers who were not milling around by
then were all awake for the breakfast. 

Friday was spent watching people and buses come in and setup camp. I
had some enjoyable time just reading in the sun while the kids played
with each other on the playground. Ric spent some time trying to
balance a rock on a boulder, and actually accomplished the task. The
rest of the day was spent doing absolutely nothing, and boy was it
great. That night was spent visiting old friends and making new ones.
We also got a chance to really see the cool fire ring burn some wood. 

Saturday morning was much warmer and so were Steph's spirits. The
morning kicked off by OVT getting the breakfast burritos started. Our
camp joined in and the masses were fed to their hearts content. This
time around there were plenty of stoves so I just waited till the end
and did KP duty. I do have to admit that cooking is more fun than
cleaning, but it all needs done. Thanks to all the people that helped.
The breakfast burrito is one of my favorite things about being a
Moonie. Mid-morning was when all the planned events got going. The kid
activities got going with the Moon Bounce. What a fantastic idea by
Chris. I missed the first onrush, but I was told the line was quite
long. I wandered over to the bounce near lunch and took over watching
the kids for a while. Made a few little friends also. Especially Emma
Auch who just hung onto my leg nearly the entire time. What a sweetie. 

When it neared 2 Jamie came back over to watch the bounce so I could
get ready for the troubleshooting trials. Ric, Chris and I had spent a
little while earlier in the day discussing what could go wrong, so we
felt pretty confident that we could get it running with no problem.
We all got dressed in matching mechanic cover-alls, scrubs and scull
caps. To complete the ensemble we also brought our fire extinguishers.
With our fan club in tow we started to walk the camp with our theme
music playing in the background. If only we could have done one of
those movie tricks where the group walks in half time to the theme
music, oh well. When we arrived at the trial location Greg and Mark
had not yet finished &quot;breaking&quot; the bus from the last group. We took
the time to have one more walk around the block. What a fun event.
That bus was really messed up. We caught many of the problems, but
completely missed out on many of the issues. We gave it a good try,
but in the end the bus beat us.  Kudos to both Greg and Mark for
taking the time to put it on. 

We spend the time after that waiting on the Chili supper to get on
the way. As usual the supper was superb. I ate my fill (and then
some). and then made another stroll around the camp. On the opposite
side was Al (the heater guy) who I talked with a bit over an issue
with my heater. I got a buzz on the radio to make it back to camp, the
awards would be starting soon. On the way back I ran into Tom Tartka,
who offered me a beer. Naturally I accepted, but as soon as the top
was popped I got another call on the radio. I apologized to Tom and
headed on. Saw John Baker and got side tracked again. I'm sure you can
see the pattern here. In any event, I eventually made it back to camp,
where I was informed that our team needed to get back in uniform for
the awards. Sure sounded like I missed a meeting. We quickly got
dressed and then mingled in the crowd for the awards. 

Chris spent a bit giving out the awards and passing around the thanks
for the people who helped make the extra activities run smooth. As
runner-up of the time trials we presented the 1st place team (who I
think called themselves the 3 stooges) the very cool plates made by
their boss Mark :) MUD graced the crowd with a bit of prose and poetry
about the chili and then presented Chris with one item that was
missing from his life. Yes that's right folks, exactly what you would
guess. A &quot;red cup&quot; hat. Trust me folks you can't make this stuff up.
The remainder of the group time was spent passing out the door prizes.
Lots of cool stuff were dispensed around the crowd. During the prize
part I got a chance to catch up with Kelly Met-Wiz who I haven't seen
since EB02. 

The rest of the family turned in a bit early so I was left to
socialize for everyone at once. This was a good thing for me. I got to
talk with many of the people I had not gotten a chance to talk with
as of yet this trip. Had a very enjoyable conversation about the trip
Cory and friends took down to Atlanta from the north, and compared how
much nicer his split window is than mine. The rest of the night was
spent either in my camp talking with Tartka again. We had a great time
discussing some of the topics of the T2 &amp; VB lists. A bit later I
moved over to the fire ring, where I know us, Dolan, Marcus and
various other people who's names I don't remember discussed lots of
minute details of items that held high importance around the campfire,
but I suspect really were not that important. I crashed around 2 or 3
for a quick nap before leaving.

Sunday morning was the warmest by far. After a quick breakfast we
started to break camp. We said goodbye to many old friends and some of
the new ones. Unfortunately I didn't get one family's email address to
contact them (Dave, Madonna, and family). So if they read this contact
me. It was their first event and they were really enjoying themselves.
Late morning saw the TN Mech moving out. This leg of the adventure
added a few more buses. Mike D and Jerry. Our course and the Canadians
held together to the nearest gas station, where everyone tanked up
with some petro. Since my family was hungry and it appeared that the
rest of our group was gonna go ahead, we left slightly early and drove
to McD's. There Dave was apparently having trouble with his bus and
got the dune buggy running. The rest of the crew pulled into the lot
and got lunch as well. After all you can't pilot your bus properly on
an empty stomach. Getting onto the interstate split the carabus up. A
few miles down the road we all managed to group up again and proceeded
to put the miles behind us. The only real issue with the carabus was
since Ric's antenna was broken, he was only able to talk via FRS,
while the rest of us were on CB. No real issue, we just made it work. 

Since Ric's bus runs a bit hot we kept the speed down to 55 where
everyone was happy. Made it all the to Wilkesboro for a break and gas.
Eddie had one of the infrared thermostats so we compared temps and got
about the same temps for all 5 1600s (4 bays and 1 split). After we
cooled down a bit, everyone loaded up to pull out and start the last
leg toward Roan Mtn. Something happened to Jerry's accel cable and he
moved a whopping 50 feet into another parking space. A bit of time was
spent working on the accel. We managed to rig something (well the
people actually working on it, I was managing ;-0) and got him back on
the road. The decision was made to not take the parkway this time and
just drive the normal roads. The rest of the trip was pretty calm.
Kids slept and the pilots spent the time pulling away from each other
and bunching back together again. We pulled into the animal hosp for a
quick leg stretch. 

It was decided that Slaymaker, Jerry and us were to follow Eddie and
Mike into Elizabethtown then turn our separate ways. A few bus related
sites were pointed out to us on the way and we found ourselves at the
split. There we got a treat. Mike pulled up right behind a Honda
Insight (the elect car) and we got quite the chuckle out of that sight,
straight from the commercial. That was one sight I really wish I had
on the camera. It got to be dinner time before we knew it so everyone
decided to make a stop for some eats. We all took a break at DQ and
got recharged with some good fried food. We proceeded to drive the
highways down when It occurred to me that we were still on our 55 mph
pace. I called over the CB to everyone that I had no problem picking
up the pace to 65. No sooner had that left my mouth than Jerry was
pulling away. He turned off a bit later to head to his home, and
Slaymaker and us pressed onto Knoxville. We drove through K-town and
on the west side said goodbye to him. It was already getting late, and
the invite to stay at his place was very appealing, but everyone
needed to get back for school and work. 

I drove a bit down I-40 until I was just too tired to drive. Steph
took over piloting Butch so I could recharge for an hour or so. I woke
up sometime later to look over at a very tense pregnant woman. I
forget how a person not used to piloting gets stressed at the odd
handing characteristics of the bus. I took over and drove the rest of
the way into Dickson. Pretty uneventful trip home. We pulled in
around 2am and everyone crashed. We had a very full long weekend and a
very enjoyable time. If you haven't been to EB you are truly missing
something special to the bus community. Thanks a bunch for everything
you do Chris to put on this event.
