Okay,

You want the same thing? dont want to spend much?  Here is the scoop.

Find an autostick/71 bus/late beetle distributor.  I am only familiar with
the autostick and 71 bus ones so i'll speak to that. (i have one of
each...)

These have both centrifugal and vacuum advance.  Now that would be a DVDA
dizzy (dual vacuum dual advance)  these can be recognized as the can has 2
hoses to it.  These, if both hoses are hooked up, need to be timed at 5
degrees after top dead center.

Now wanna make it a single vacuum dual advance distributor (SVDA)?

Method i'm familiar with:
just leave the larger of the vacuum ports open to the atmosphere.  Time it
to 7.5 BTDC (do it to 30 total advance to be safe i suppose)  You will
have to do your own experiments here as i havent actually tried this
yet... but have been told it works perfectly.

You could possibly just put on a single vacuum can in place of the dual
one, that might be the modified one that John sells i dunno... or maybe
later beetles had the centrifugal and vaccum without a hose to the retard
side of the can...

Now, implied in the above is that you know a good distributor from a bad
one, and that you can find a good one.

This is all MHO so feel free to rake me over the coals...

take care,

Steve
