I think I already have this answered, but to make sure...

I have an ambo step I was hoping to put on the '54 RHD.  I
did a test fit last night, since I'm at the part where I'm
fitting the belly pans, and it looks like it's not going
to work.  I thought I could take a right-hand-side step
and just flip it around, but it appears that the pedal is in
the way of the jack point.  If I move the step closer to the
middle of the bus so the pedal does not interfere, it appears to
be too far over to be functional - or is it?  Perhaps placed
in the middle it could be used for either getting in the front
or the back?  All of the pix I've seen had the step closer
to the edge of the cargo door frame.   Hmm.  Maybe I should
just shorted the rod that goes out to the pedal (a bit of 
deliberate vintage nazi tweekage there).  (Yes, it is the
belly pan version of the step)  Anyone have a left-hand-door,
belly pan ambo step they wish to trade?

A pic of the step up next to the bus is available at:
