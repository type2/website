List
I have a set of duel 40's in good condition I want to use on my new stroker
motor (1955). Currently the ventures in them are size 34. I have been told
this size is great for bugs and buggies that want to go fast, but for
drivability in a bus I should look for size 28 or 30 to replace them. Anyone
want to comment on this? Also anyone have the parts for sale / trade.
Thanks in advance,
Shawn
