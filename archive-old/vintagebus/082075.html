Subject: Re: [VB] New VW longblock vs build up from scratch

I would reccomend going with the Mexican or Brazillian longblocks. I have been running those engines in everything from a Bug to a Bay Window Westy and have had wonderfull success with them. For the dollar they are the best deal, you can't get and engine built with equivilant parts for less, though BAP in Phoenix comes close...they use all new Mexican/Brazillian parts and then assemble the longblocks themselves. I have had two of their engines, one which was crap and the other in my '65 standard sunroof Bus which runs great.
