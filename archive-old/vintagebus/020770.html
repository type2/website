Subject: Starbucks please....I'll wait.

Hey John   Your not alone!!! I feel the 
same way.Most all the people I see in all the buses in
and around town wave back.There are a few salty types
that dont but I know who they are so I dont bother
with them anymore.Like you say they were in a bay
window...they most likely did not see you because they
were on their cell phone calling starbucks for a
double expresso latte jumbo whatever the heck it is
they call it.....Later and right back at ya pal!!!
(not counting your friend and you of course on that
phone joke)

Mark and his under-repair...by me...poor thing..67 Deluxe walk thru 13 window Ol'No Name in San Luis Obispo,Calif...7 miles to the ocean! Sea-Ya (:}
