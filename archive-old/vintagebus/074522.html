&gt; Before I do this, I'd like to go through it and do any replacing or 
&gt; rebuilding needed.

Hi Rex,
You need to take apart the link pins and clean all the gunked up old grease 
out of them!  Do the same with the wheel bearings  While apart inspect for 
wear, and make sure to keep pieces seperate.  With the swing arms free of the 
link pins test by pushing and shoving these arms to make sure they rotate, 
with out the bases wobbling in the torsion tubes.  Any wobble means ruined 
needle bearings or if it is a 1964-65 possibly worn out inner bushings/outer 
needle bearings.

&gt; Also, can I use the '67 steering box?

No problem!  Just make sure to drain the box of old oil/grease/metal shavings 
and refill with 90WT gear oil mixed with STP for thickness for a leak free 
lubricant, but not too thick as to cause winter lube problems.
