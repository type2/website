&gt; This can get to be tricky deciding who is in and who is out.--


Following that line of reasoning that arbitrarily excluded Uncle Jerry's
Hearse, and referring back to today's earlier post regarding the Westfalia:
if the Frickinger Hearse was disallowed, also disallowed would be all
Hebmuellers, Westfalias (and other camper conversions) as well as Binz's.
Also left in the parking lot would be the various fire trucks, ambulances,
taco stands etc..
