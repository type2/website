I *think* that the middle two were for the foyer tent and the outter two were 
for the privy tent.
Correct me if im wrong.

&lt;&lt;Can someone help clarify the roof mounted tent brackets for early 
Westfalia's?  My '59 came to me with 2 roof mounted tent brackets, one being 
the taller bracket and the other being the short bracket.  Then there is the 
front bumper bracket.  All 3 of which I have.

There is a set of brackets on eBay right now (item #324468860) showing 4 roof 
brackets.  I've never seen 4 before.  Is this for a later (mid '60's) setup, 
or am I missing something here?  Two brackets is what you're missing, right!? 
hehehehe

TIA.
