Warning: this is not personal, so don't be offended:

Tasteful trailer lights?  *Tasteful*?  ROFLMAO!

Man, are prices going crazy or what?

$10,500 for a starter project.  Paint &amp; body is another easy $5k-$10k,
rubber &amp; interior bits another $5k, easy.  Stuff you didn't think about,
lessay $2k.  That's a lot of change behind the sofa.  You'd be breaking
even to sell her for $30k at that point.  

My &quot;free&quot; panel has sunk me almost $1000 so far, (complete brakes, tires,
front seat covers from Lenny Copp) and luckily I've been able to borrow
from the parts bus and my personal stash for stuff.  Heck, I spent $30+
just on stuff to clean the stench out of it!  It runs, but we haven't even
thought of clutch or tranny at this point.

And someone said VW's were cheap?
