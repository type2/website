I've seen a few shortened Single Cabs in my time, one that
someone bought thinking it was stock!

There's a shorty Single Cab in Phoenix, camoflauge paint,
they even shortened the tool chest area.  I hypothesized
with another listee that it would make a good slide-out gun
rack, he thought a file cabinet would be cool.  :)
