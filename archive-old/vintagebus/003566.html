Very, very possible I'll be going through Springfield. Don't know for sure
when but if my finances come through as planed then I'll leave Chicago
Saturday the 28th of October and I can stop in Springfield for the night to
get some rest before heading out to Oklahoma City on Sunday. Or I can do
something else. I can get there, pick-up my bus on Sunday and stop in
Springfield to rest a bit and then head home. Yeah, I think that that's what
I'm gonna do. Sounds like a plan to me. How would I get in touch with you?

Let me know,

&gt; Hi Andre,
&gt;
&gt; There are a few of us here in Springfield, MO.  If you have some idea when
&gt; you might be coming through, we could call a little club meeting and
&gt; everyone could say hi.
&gt;
&gt; Later,
&gt; Matt Montgomery
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; &gt; Heading to Oklahoma City next weekend. Probably will leave Chicago early
&gt; &gt; Saturday as I'm picking my 65 up on Sunday.
&gt; &gt; Anybody on my way or in the area???
&gt; &gt;
