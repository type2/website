Subject: 66 vs. 68 rear seats

	My 66 has the original 1/3 2/3 bench in front and '68 rear and 2/3
middle basketweave seats in the cargo area. I'd like to cover all seats with
Vintage Leatherette.

	Rocky has the same stock number for both 66 and 68 rear and 2/3
middle seats. Should the upholstery between these two years be
interchangeable? What's the diff?
