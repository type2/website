 Hi All...

Here's some blather about my day...

I was playing with the front end of my '66 Westy today, putting in new brake
shoes, new brake cylinders, and new flex hoses.  The brakes feel awesome!
(They stop the bus, too!)

Then I greased everything real good-like (including myself), and tried to
adjust the play (excessive) out of the torsion arm link pins, and never got
the &quot;clunk-chunk&quot; to go away on the passenger side.  Kingpin bushings are
shot.  Bogus. Then I thought for a while about installing that swing lever
bushing kit that I've had sitting around for a day like today.  Or next
week, howz that, eh?  The play isn't anywhere near the amount of movement
from the passenger side tie rod, so I'll fix that first...(tomorrow I pick
up a new one)

So I do the next easiest thing:  I install the rear camber compensator on
the '60 DC, and test drive it.  I'm not sure yet, if it's doing anything
useful.  Maybe I don't drive my Type 2's like sports cars enough or
something.  I did notice that the bracket that is attached to the tranny by
the four lowest side cover studs had moved down...it was (as per
instructions) right up against the bottom of the tranny when I started out.
They say 25 ft.-lbs. torque on those, but I don't see any provision for
keeping the whole assembly from slipping.  I'll take it apart tomorrow an
bend the tabs a bit so they don't slide.

And then I decided to go pick up the new KYB GR-2's that I had ordered for
the front of the '66.  I got home with them (I have been saturating the
shock bolts with &quot;penetrating oil&quot; for days already) and proceed with the
old shock removal.  The top bolt/nut of the pass. side shock comes off
fairly easily, and I had to beat/heat/twist the insert of the shock off the
bottom stud, but that was all expected.  Now there's a nice new shock
absorber on the passenger side....the garbage I took off of there had about
1% of its dampening power left!  On to the driver's side I go....the bottom
nut comes off lickety-split, and the nut for the top comes off without too
much of a fight....but that top bolt has become one with the bus, and I have
come to the conclusion that &quot;penetrating oil&quot; of all brands is for the
birds.   Ya, it works well enough once things move a little, but I have
never had it work on something that is totally seized.  But I use it anyway,
and gobs of it...just in case.  I have pounded, exerted much torque,
sprayed, torched until much of the rubber of the shock mount is burned away,
and the undercoating is liquefying, and pounded some more, and used the Muir
cold chisel and a hammer trick, and even called it a bad name once, and
sprayed more snake oops I mean penetrating oil on it, and cooked and ate
dinner, and then did it all again, and finally gave up and installed the
Berg temperature dipsticks that arrived today in both the '66 and the
'60...summertime's here, and my dipsticks have been hotter.....I'll go at
that bolt again tomorrow.....

I love being a slave to my buses!

Gene
