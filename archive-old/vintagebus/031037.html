Subject: RE:VWOA show


By all means go!  But if you value the hobby, you'll take some
responsibility
for it and your involvement in it and voice your opinion of their
actions and
tactics.  It is incumbent on all of us to take responsibility for this
hobby
and tell the people trying to shut it down how we feel.

Don't delude yourselves into believing that VW is happy with the
air-cooled
people.  They could care less as shown by their actions and abandonment
of
their early cars.  Almost every other manufacture out there supports
their
older cars.  VW despises them.  Don't buy a NEW VW product, and tell
them
about it!

&gt; no offense to ya ronnie, your the man, BUT, that's easy for you to say
when
&gt; there are MANY other shows to attend out west. There are only like a
dozen
&gt; *good* shows here in the north east ALL season (if that). besides this
show
&gt; is hosted by the Michigan Air Cooled club. VWoA doesnt do anything but
let
&gt; them use the parking lot and open the doors so we can check out a few
cars.
