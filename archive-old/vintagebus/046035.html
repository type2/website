Subject: 40hp cam plug
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

does anyone know where i can get a cam plug to fit an early 40hp case?  i 
thought they were the same as 1600's but the ones i have dont fit.  all the 
places ive checked only carry one, and i know that would be for the 1600's.  
or if anyone even has a usable one and wants to part with it, ill buy it.  
any help is appreciated.  also, could you still get a bus in 65 with a 
1200cc, or were they all 1500's by then?  
thanks,
josh
