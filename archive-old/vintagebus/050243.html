Subject: Looking for early bullet signal metal
Message-Id: &lt;v04011700b363b365f58b_at_[207.136.15.251]&gt;

anyone got a pair of the early bullet signal metal bases they could cut off
a crushed nose? I need a pair of 'em.  Let me know. I guess I could use the
whole assembly with them if they are there too.
