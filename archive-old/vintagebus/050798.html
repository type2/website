&gt;There is no power getting to the coil, but there is power at the fuse 
&gt;(2nd one from right). I think it could be a broken wire.

Probably so.  You might wiggle the fuse clips and wire terminals at
the fuse box to make sure everything is solid there.  You might also
check back in the engine compartment for a bad splice in the feed wire
to the coil - that wire often gets spliced with an engine fire, engine
swap, or when changing to a non-electric-choke carb.  Wires can break
anywhere but they often break close to the terminals on the ends - you
might be able to get away with cutting an inch or three off the end of
the wire and putting a new terminal on it.
