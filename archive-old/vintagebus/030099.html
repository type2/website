I said 0 is the beginning of any numbering system. Of course you would
count 1,2,3,4 cylinders because these are whole cylinders. If you cut a
cylinder in half and destroy the other half then you have .5 of a
cylinder (half of a whole). That would leave you with 3 and a half
cylinders and you'd have to get a whole one to complete your engine.
Years are divided into months which until the year is over is not a
whole year yet. 

Regardless of whether they started the calendar at 1 or not 0 is still
the bottom line. If we're going by the fact that they started at year 1
then by all means 2001 is the start of the new millennium, but it's
still in my opinion incorrect.

&gt; OK, let's count cylinders in a VW.  0, 1, 2, 3.
&gt; 
&gt; We're all driving three cylinder cars!
