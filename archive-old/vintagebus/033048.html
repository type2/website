&lt;&lt;  I like the clean look of the original crimp type V.W. hose clamps, but 
can't 
find them anywhere.  Anybody try these heat shrink clamps?  Looks like they 
would be pretty, and after all that's what counts on a V.W. engine.

I think I would wait a few months and see what happens to this product. Every 
time you see a new product come out its supposed to be the best, but after a 
few months you find out you wasted your money.

If it works like it says it does, heck ill even buy some but I'll wait it out 
a bit.
