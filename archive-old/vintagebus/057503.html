Subject: RE: [VB] hazetguy's strange engine trouble

all this reminds me of the theory i once heard:
basically the theory goes that at idle a vw engine only fires on the front(?) two cylinders.  once under load, all four fire normally.  if i remember correctly, the person responsible for this theory was, figuratively, ripped to shreds.

anyone else hear this theory or something similar?  this might be better on friday unless that is what hazetguy is experiencing with his engine....

cheers,
