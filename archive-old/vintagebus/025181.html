Zac,

Set the 009 to 5BTDC at idle, which should give you between 27 and 29
full advance at 3500 rpm. Set a single or dual vac at about 7 BTDC. This
will also give you 27 to 29 at full advbance, assuming that the vacuum
is working. If the vacuum is not working, plug all the vacuum ports and
set it to 10BTDC, which will give you nearly 25 full advance at 2500.
I like to set with a static light, and then check with a strobe.

Muir siad a lot of things, and many of them are right on the money. I
disagree with him on mechanical advance distributors, but many mechanics
I respect like them a lot. If you get the chance try a nice vacuum that
works.  Very nice to drive.
