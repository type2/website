&gt; I brought home a complete engine today. It looks like it's been
&gt; sitting for
&gt; a long time. What procedures should I go thought to prep the engine for a
&gt; test run?
&gt;
&gt; Also, can I test the engine without installing it in a vehicle? What steps
&gt; are involved in that? Thanks.



Not that I'm by any means the biggest expert on this list, but I'll put in
my $.02 on this one...
When starting an old engine that hasn't been run in a long time, I have
always removed the spark plugs and filled the holes with WD40, marvel
mystery oil, or even motor oil in a pinch, then let it sit a few days before
turning the engine gingerly with a wrench.  (Never force it.)  The idea is
to lubricate the rings that may have rusted to the walls over time and could
tear, resulting in ring damage to an engine that otherwise would have been
fine. I also have an old trans and starter that I use to turn an engine that
is not in a vehicle, just for the purposes of testing compression, etc.
This won't guarantee that the engine is good but can at least eliminate some
that are not.
