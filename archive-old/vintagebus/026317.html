Just received a letter &amp; photo from a friend of mine --in it was picture
of a 53 Kombie--abandoned!! One side window gone--late style
tail-lights--showing some rust.
The 53 is in Sao Paulo, Brazil--you can see a free-way in the
background. Still has plates on it.--Me thinks the Vintage Type II crowd
is not that strong in the area?  The photo will appear in an upcoming
issue of the NEATO newsletter, OBR-- PS, it appears to be still a
&quot;roller&quot;---uncle jerry
