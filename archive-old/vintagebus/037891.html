Well,
     I talked to the previous owner before the last owner and he said it was
on there when he got the bus.  That would make it 22 years ago.  The bus
hasnt moved in 12 years.

&lt;&lt; Anyway, on the rearview mirror there is a flip down smoked plastic
cover 
for
 those nasty highbeams in the mirror.  Ive never seen this before and
this
 thing is in excellent shape.  Is this a rare accesory, and whats its
value
 you think? the mirror and shade are in great shape.   &gt;&gt;

If it an original period piece it may be valuable to someone.  They are
being 
reproduced and available through Koch, Vintage Parts and the like. I
have a 
repo in my Single Cab and works great when you get a jacked up 4x4
behind you.
