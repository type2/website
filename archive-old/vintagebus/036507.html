Hi Drew,
Our APR58 parts manual has a 211 251 185 which would be a 25-36 HP unit.  
Guessing your's is a Bastard 40HP tip.  These tips and mufflers do not come 
straight toward the rear like the 40HP on thru 1600 once.  Instead the pipe 
coming out of the muffler and the section of the tip that goes in there are 
at a 45 degree angle toward the left rear.  Probably due to not wanting to 
waste perfectly good production machinery these tips were used in early type 
threes also.
