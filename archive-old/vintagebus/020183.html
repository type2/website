I've driven with the Safari's open in the SF Bay Area, San Jose, Wine
Country, LA, and Santa Barbara area.  In each area, I've seen officers,
and in Santa Barbara, an officer gave me a thumbs up and a smile.  In
Napa, where I used to live, if it was reasonable, I always had them open.
 I've been seen by numerous law folks.  

The only stop-enjoying-your-bus ticket I got was in Santa Barbara.  I had
a German plate on the front and the meter maid hit me for not having both
plates displayed.  By the way, that never happened in Napa, where I drove
my bus as my main car every day for two years.
