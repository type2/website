Subject: RE: [VB] 67 bus running out of gas

&gt;If i can source a fuel sender today i can yank the tank
back out and put it in, else, im fuel gauge less for a while more until I 
put the 1500 back in
and source the bay tank and its fuel sender.&lt;

Ronnie at Old Volks has new Siemens split fuel senders.

Also I suggest a good pro cleaning of the tank and some tank sealer.

Personally I remove the fuel sock in the tank.  If it gets clogged you are 
pretty screwed on the side of the road.

Take Care,
Adrian Pillow
