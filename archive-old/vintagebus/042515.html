&gt; &lt;&lt; Thanks for posting a positive note on your transaction. I've been in 
&gt;  this hobby for a number of years and the anti-Japanese viewpoint has 
&gt;  always bugged me. People get paranoid sounding like it's a plot to 
&gt;  rid the US of every VW. &gt;&gt;
well,

Here's my $0.02 on the subject. I am not against the Japaneese or british,
both groups buy busses here and ship them abroad.  I get VolksWorld from
the UK sometimes and they advertise scads of rust free california sheet
metal as well as busses.

It just saddens me i suppose, that we undervalue the bus so much that any
seller who wants a decent price almost has to sell abroad to make a good
profit...

Nope, i think if the japanese/british want a bus bad enough to pay top
dollar for it AND pay to have it shipped to where they live thats their
privelege to do so.

What bugs me is that we have the most busses of anywhere, and we hack em
up when they can be saved.  Attrition is how a resource becomes scarce, we
are making busses more scarce by hacking em up, and selling parts and
busses aborad makes them even more scarce.

So, i have nothing against the japaneese/british, i just know that all
these busses leaving the country is what is driving prices up, but i guess
if that will make us save busses instead of hacking em up for parts, thats
better anyway.  Getting upset about it really wont change anything... if i
had a bus and i could get double from a japaneese gentleman and i needed
the money, it would be terribly altruistic of me to not sell it to him,
and the next guy i sold it to might sell it abroad anyway.... or not treat
it well and kill it.... really once its out of your hands who knows... go
where you can do the best for you and yours $ wise, or sell it locally, it
really doesnt matter either way once its not yours anything could happen
to it...

take care,

Steve
