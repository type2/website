NORAD just reported what they thought was a missle launched from Oregon,

&gt;    I have been dealing with a VW parts (wholesale) supplier that has been
in
&gt; business for 36 years that is clearing out DEAD INVENTORY. They have parts
&gt; going back 36 plus years including Genuine VW parts, Boge shocks, Fichtal
&gt; and Sachs shocks, ton's of engine parts etc.. I will have a complete
&gt; inventory list (of what I'm getting) and pricing.
