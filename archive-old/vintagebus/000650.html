Hi Mike,
What you have there was designed for a type 1 and K. Ghia with 1500/1600cc 
engine.  Most likely a post 1967 model.  We have been able to pick up plenty 
of unknown condition gas heaters out here for $20-30.00 at the swaps.  Check 
out gas heater repair shops to see if they have xeroxes of the manuals for 
these heaters or sometimes they show up at swap meets.   Eric&amp;Barb
