&gt;  We need to set a scale when someone says &quot;really
&gt;  rare&quot;, I wouldnt consider them rare, more like

&gt;  &gt; ya- they made them - but they are really rare,
&gt;  &gt; especially in the USA.  I have 
&gt;  &gt; seen a LHD LHside door splitty- that was wierd
&gt;  
a scale is a good idea=

however, I hgave seen more BD deluxes than LHD splits DD L

also more  sliding sunroof sliding side door splits
more flip seat westies 

more ambulances

more binzes

but it probably is annoying to drive in regular use
