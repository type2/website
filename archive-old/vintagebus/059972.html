Subject: Emergency light switch and knob on a 66 bus

------=_NextPart_000_0018_01C22B82.DFE8BD30
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

Does anyone have a digital photo, or could take a digital photo of the =
emergency light knob on a 66 bus?

I want to fit one to my UK bus, but a 66 switch is different to pre 66, =
and any switch is rare in the UK.

Could someone also recommend any 2nd hand car part dealers in the US =
that may be able to supply with a switch and knob - I think the part =
number of the switch body is 111 953 235 or the same suffixed by an A on =
a 67.

Thanks
Paul
