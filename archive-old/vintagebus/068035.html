Subject: Re: [VB] cyl head temp

It's the compression ratio that really determines head temps.  If you 
run your air cooled vw with a CR over 7-1, expect high cylinder head 
temperatures.  Higher CR will give you more power and better fuel 
economy.  The down side with high CR is that you need to have the 
cooling system in 100% perfect condition and not let the head temps get 
too high.  You will need to drive cautiously in hot weather especially 
under high loads at high speed.

Here in southern az I run my '67 bus with a compression ratio of 6.6-1.  
I can pretty much drive the thing flat out in the high summer heat we 
are treated with and not worry much.  The down side is lower power and 
less fuel economy.  Also, the heater is a bit weaker in the winter.  On 
the power issue, since the engine does not over heat and lose power, it 
gives all of its power going up hill and under load.  So, maybe I am not 
compromising all that much!   The new mexican engines are all 6.6-1 from 
what I hear...   Gary Gibson
