Subject: Re: [VB] CE Safaris in Green/Bronze, US laws?

My '65 Westy had very blue/green tinted (in the glass)front glass when I
got it.  At that time (my first bus) I thought it was original (it has
Newport Beach Yacht Club stickers from the late 60's on it) but later
found out it was not.  I've never seen this color glass on any other
splittie.  I guess it was something the PO had cut and installed.  I
still have it (the bus is a looong term project) since the poor
thing(the Westy) is still in pieces :-(

Anyone else have old colored/tinted glass on their split?

&gt; A) ever offered on buses as original?
