&gt; Here's what I know about it.  My 58' and 59' don't have the crescent, but my
&gt; 60' did.  For been only used for 4 years I seem to have quite a few in
&lt;snipperoo&gt;

I just finally figured what the heck this thread is talking about! 

The Eccles and Ellis spec guide sez that the half-moon recess is 61-62
only. But I know that an early 63 panel we had at the shop for a while
had it....and MrBubblehead says his '60 did...
