Hi All, I was going through a box of spare parts to look for a 59' door
handle for a friend. There appears to be two different types. The screws
that hold it in place, seem to be a different distance from where the
gasket/base sits on the outer door. Does that make any sense? Could one be
for an early  Beetle? I thaink they all had &quot;211&quot; part numbers..
TIA
