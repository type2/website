I had a similar experience trying to order rubber for my '55.
The guy didn't seem to know buses, and I ended up with 1/2 of the
stuff for an early bus and half for a lagwagen.

One thing that bugs me is you get no packing slip from RMMW when
you order this way; you get one from bus depot, but there is no
hard correlation between the Bus Depot invoice and the Rocky Mountain
invoice, and nothing to match against what shows up in the box.

Ie, you could order a table lamp from Bus Depot, and their invoice
shows 1 table lamp; Rocky Mountain ships one pint of vanilla ice cream,
and the set of ginsu knives is on back order, which shows up weeks
later when you're not even expecting it...
