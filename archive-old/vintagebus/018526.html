The new back parking lot at Kelly Park is very nice and quite large.  Put the swap back there and the show in the park.  Seems simple to me.

Make it &quot;67 and Earlier&quot; Bugs and Busses plus all Type 3s, Things, etc.. and
everything would be fine.

I think if they make people park outside the show, they better have security
to watch over the vehicles.
