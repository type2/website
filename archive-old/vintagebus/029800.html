&lt;&lt;I know they were going to have to shut it down eventually because of
some legal mumbo jumbo and it looks like indeed, the lawyers possibly
won
again.&gt;&gt;

Please . . . don't blame it on the lawyers. They have no choice. It is
the law itself and the interpretation of that law by the courts.
Volkswagen and its lawyers are only trying to protect what is there most
valuable asset. . . their name. If they don't vigorously defend their
trademark they will lose it as so many others have.

The attorneys would themselves be sued for malpractice by Volkswagen if
they did not protect this name and trademark.
