&gt; Had a great time in Jerome. Karl's '77 Westy had two flats on the way to
 Phoenix. He carries two spares.

Add my name to this list.  I blew two tires in 100 miles (belt
separations) and now carry two spares when I venture far from home.  Never
had to use either of them, but I don't want to be at the mercy of a random
tire vendor with the bus's rare tire size.

If I head for snow country, both spares get equipped with chains.  It is
easier to change wheels than to install chains!
