I finally got up off my rear...actually, I had to sit down to do it, but I
_finally_ put the PDF files into the documentation project pages.  Rex
Rogers was kind enough to do this conversion for me quite a while ago, and
they've been sitting around doing nothing until now.  The PDFs are for
section 1-6 of the 58-67 split parts manual, and W/O Guesswork through 1969.
The whole mess is available here:

http://home.cwru_dot_edu/~agw4/docs.htm

Believe it or not, I'm scanning section 7 now, and I hope to have everything
I've got available to me scanned by early next week before the next half of
summer session kicks in.  After that, I'll be out of stuff to scan unless
somebody lends me stuff or I win the lottery :-)

BTW, who was scanning in that camper parts list?  I lost the email and site
address in a local email crash.  I'd like to add the link.
