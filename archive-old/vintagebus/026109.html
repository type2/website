To TF&amp;KLM,
All this talk about Wide Open Throttle leads me to ask... Has anyone
ever done the old &quot;look down the carb at WOT&quot; to see if the butterfly
is/was completely vertical and perpendicular with the crab base and
found out that with the petal to the metal your bus wasn't getting all
it's allotted power?
I do it the lazy way and just see if the linkage bottoms against its
stop. Of corse the linkage could be &quot;off&quot; also...
aloha
