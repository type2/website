I left a *lot* of yellow in the driveway when I color-sanded and buffed out
my paint!

&gt; &gt;I've been using ATE Super Blue for a while now.  Such a pretty color.
&gt; &gt;Between the yellow paint, Super Blue brake fluid, purple wheel bearing
&gt; &gt;grease, and green SwepCo 201 tranny fluid, I leave quite a spot on the
&gt; &gt;driveway!
&gt; 
&gt; Yeah, but what color chassis grease and engine oil do you use?  :)
&gt; At least this way when you spring a leak it's pretty easy to tell
&gt; what it is.  If you're leaving paint on the driveway, though, you
&gt; either have a really bad paint job, or some really nasty acid rain
&gt; where you live...
