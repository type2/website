Hi,

Went out to the Pick A Part in Riverside, CA. Just off the
the 60 freeway on Pyrite.  The splittie there still has some
good parts. Most of the engine is there. The entire tranee,
minus only the big nuts is still in it. the brake drums are
still on it. The front end is still there. The Steering
column and gear box are there and appear to be in good
working order. The pitman arm has a shot ball joint. I
couldn't get the steering wheel off. All the good parts of
the interior are gone. Only the shot head liner is there.

The body is amazingly rust free. I took the right front
corner. I will need some better  nose sheet metal.

The metal around the windshields looks to be entirely rust
free. I did not remove the glass and seals to check, but
there was no rust visible.

The best part of this bus is the paint job. It is entirely
60's era tie dye/camouflag.

I would bet that the PO could easily have installed a new
engine, tranee and fixed the front end and had a great bus.
Too bad its gone now.

Karl, Thanks.
Chris
