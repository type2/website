Hi Paul,
Like we said we like the sound of the vintage Blaupunkt speakers, over modern 
speakers we have tried so far.  Unless someone can find something comparable 
sound wise, and not cost a couple of hunderd $.  Tell us about it.  Otherwise 
we can take a few minutes to repair one of the oldies.  Yes, it is enjoyable 
to fix something, and have it work properly instead of throwing money at it.  
Often you can find us sitting down after a long hard days working to watch a 
hour, or two of TV, and fix/polish a VW part at the same time.  The results 
are we spend a little less earned $ on the VWs in one respect.  At the same 
time this means we can spend more in other VW areas like new seals, 
fuel/brake lines, etc..  
The same could be true about this new bus owner, he might need more to 
replace fuel/brake lines, or other, but now instead will spend the money for 
this to replace a possibly perfectly good clutch disc.  Resulting in a good 
running VW that crashes/burns better.  Yes, one must take a objective look at 
things, and be able to say this is just too worn.  If the clutch disc is at 
8mm thickness, and is worn out at 7mm then it most likely is time to just 
change it.  So far we have not had a clutch break down due to oil on it, 
and/or removing this oil.  Matter of fact the only disc to bust up on us was 
perfectly dry.  On the other hand this kind of fix it yourself info can stick 
in ones memory to be very helpfull in a pinch while traveling out in the 
sticks.  Kind of like some friends of ours who spent a whole week instead of 
a day in White horse Alaska due to needing parts for a special clutch he had 
in his late model VW.  Even we have had to travel to three differant VW part 
shops in a large Montana town for of all things a simple brake light switch.  
So as the old saying goes knowledge is power, or at the very least can get 
you out of a bind.
