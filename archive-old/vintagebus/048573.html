Subject: RE: [VB] 36 hp air cleaner with a heater
Cc: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

&gt;What manufacture of gas heater?
&gt;
&gt;Ted

&gt;I don't think he is asking if the air cleaner needs the gas heater or how
&gt;the air cleaner hangs on the left.  I think this is what he is saying, if
&gt;you have a gas heater on the left (drivers) side of the engine compartment,
&gt;where do you put the air cleaner?  Good question.

Here is the original message, you might ask Scott:

&gt;Does anyone have a photo of how an early bus air cleaner works with a gas
&gt;heater? Right now the Zebra bus' air cleaner is hanging off to the right
&gt;with a coat hanger, but that can't be right. Charlie H once mentioned that
&gt;there is a special bracket for that, but I've never seen it. Anyone have a
&gt;good photo or a gift for description?
&gt;
&gt;Thanks,
&gt;
