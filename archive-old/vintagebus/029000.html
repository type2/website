Subject: List Up?

Sorry if this is just my fault, but I haven't received anything on the
VB list all day.
Is the list up?
BTW: I sure appreciate the content on the VB list after spending some
time on the new beetle list, half of the stuff they post is &quot;off topic&quot;.

I recenlty got my copy of VW Trends and really enjoyed the pictures of
the Jerome campout.
John
