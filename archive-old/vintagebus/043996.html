Last years event set a new record for most VW Beetles gathered at one
time.  I had a good time.  There were VWs of all kinds in attendance.  I
don't think there is going to be any record setting/breaking attempt this
year, just some casual fun.
I think I'll be going.  Not sure which Bug I'll take yet.
As time nears, let's set something up...an area to meet or time to meet,
for all, etc.
later
