Subject: Support your FLAPS (long)

I work in a fairly well stocked VW shop, where we also work on VWs and
sell used cars. I have a fair amount of experience working on my own
stuff, and have worked professionally for the last 18 months or so. I'm
paid by the hour, and usually put in 50+ hours a week, so the following
is not for my own personal profit. I think I'm speaking for most VW
FLAPS, not just my own employer.

Many of the DIYers stop by the store, sometimes to buy something they
need that day, sometimes to see what used parts we have, sometimes just
to hang out. Saturday is my favorite workday, because it is mostly
DIYers who show up. Often, we can explain how to install or tune a part
they have a question with. Sometimes I get to learn something new from
one of our customers. Lots of times we just swap stories. The DIYers are
the main reason I love working at a VW shop.

Many of our posted prices are slightly higher than the catalog prices,
but that's what you pay for the convenience of being able to get the
part that day. You have to consider the added cost of shipping when you
order a part from a catalog, too. If you're a regular customer and you
buy a lot of parts from us, we will often match catalog prices at your
request, or dig up a used part for practically nothing, along with the
free advice we often give out.

I'm not trying to cut into anyone's mail order business. This applies to
local customers, and not directed at anyone in particular. If I need to
spend a lot of money on parts, and I can save a lot by buying from
someone else, that's what I do, too... If you want something fast, maybe
some technical help or a word of encouragement (sometimes a hug, too!),
spend the extra buck or two at your Friendly Local Auto Parts Store!
