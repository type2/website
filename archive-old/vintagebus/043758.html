&gt;Since the professional -BROKEN- one on ebay just went for $400+ (NOT
&gt;including shipping), anyone out there have any ideas for a home-built
&gt;dizzy tester?

Depends on how much you want to test it.  The basic test is to spin it
with your fingers and listen.  No shiny equipment involved but this
tells you right away if it's siezed or really beat up inside.  The next
level up would probably be a distributor driveshaft, with the cam end
turned down to chuck in a variable speed drill.  You'd probably also
need either the distributor mounting part of a junk case and/or a piece
of tubing with a suitable ID to stick the bottom of the distributor and
the top of the shaft in to keep it together.  With nothing else, this
lets you do the same test as the above but &quot;at speed&quot;. 

The thing everyone is probably interested in is the advance curve,
though.  The points can be used to tell you when the distributor would
&quot;fire&quot; - you don't need or want to hook up a coil.  If it's feasible to
unhook the condenser for this that would help as well.  I'd try
something like a +5VDC supply with the + side through a 1K resistor to
the wire from the points and the - side to the distributor body.  This
gives you a 5 volt square wave with a rising edge when the points open
and a falling edge when they close.

This is fine by itself but it doesn't give you a reference point.  To
get that, you would have to designate one point in the rotation of
your shaft/drill arrangement as &quot;TDC&quot; and put some kind of sensor on
it that triggers at that point.  I'd guess that a little vane attached
to the shaft triggering a photosensor (LED/phototransistor pair) would
probably be easiest.  Again this would be driven by +5v and buffered
to give you a square wave, say with the rising edge at TDC.

Now, the time between rising edges on the shaft sensor will give you
seconds/rev which you can easily convert to revs/minute.  The time
between the rising edge on the points and the rising edge on the
shaft sensor will tell you how much advance there is at that RPM.
Theoretically, you should be able to do this for each cylinder and
see things like the retarded timing on #3 (for cooling) that some
VW distributors have.  Practically, I wonder if it wouldn't get
lost in the normal jitter of the mechanism.  (Cue mental image
of this guy http://www.bosch_dot_de/archiv/de/timeline/details/images/n4.jpg
saying &quot;I find your lack of faith...disturbing&quot;.)

The two timing signals would be fed to some hardware to do the math
and give you a report.  You might need something like a microcontroller,
or maybe a PC could do it...I haven't done the math on the timing
involved.  This is a &quot;bench test&quot; solution.  I have thought about
trying to do an &quot;in-place&quot; test - condition the signal on the points
wire (large voltage swings) and install a TDC sensor on the engine
to get the same data - but 1) this seems harder and 2) you probably
don't want to have to rev your engine to 6K+ in idle just to check out 
the distributor.

All of this is just for mechanical distributors and/or the mechanical
part of combination distributors.  To test the vacuum advance on
distributors that have it, you'd need a source of vacuum (really?)
and the easiest way to get that would be a hand vacuum pump like a
Mityvac.  You'd probably also want a valve that you can just barely
open to bleed some vacuum - Mityvacs have a valve but it's mostly for
dumping all the vacuum at once, not fine control.  You need a vacuum
gauge too, which most hand pumps have.

First, you'd run the distributor through the RPMs with the vacuum
advance can open to the atmosphere and find out how much mechanical
advance it has at different points.  Then you'd hook up the vacuum
pump to the distributor and pump it up past the highest vacuum reading
of interest, and watch the gauge for a while to make sure it doesn't
leak down (if it does, you have a bad vacuum advance can).  Once that's
OK, you'd crack open the valve and let the system bleed down to the
first vacuum reading of interest, close the valve, and take a reading.
Crack the valve again, let it bleed down some more, close it, check
the advance again, and repeat until you have as much detail as you want.

The simplest implementation of the vacuum-advance testing would be
to write down the vacuum readings and note which set of electronic
advance readings they go with.  If you wanted to get really fancy,
you could incorporate a pressure sensor into the circuitry and tee
your vacuum into that, and let the computer log the vacuum along
with the readings.

Can you tell I've thought about this before?  :)
