As some of you may remember...about a month ago I ran across a 21 window,
'67 deluxe sunroof Bus sitting out in a farmers field.  I never did get a
response from the farmer about it.
Well, I have found a really nice '65 sunroof 21 window deluxe that has New
York plates on it...is sitting in an impound yard and if it isn't claimed
soon, it goes up for auction.
I have been a type I guy for the most part, but have been lured with
purchases of a '61 double cab (and I love driving that thing!) and a '66
Westy which seems like it will be the ultimate camper for me!  Anyway, I'm
beginning to wonder if I'm perhaps a &quot;closet&quot; type II guy underneath all
this type I facade!
Should I just come out and proclaim my proclivity!
later
