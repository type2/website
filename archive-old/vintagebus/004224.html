If you measure the current used by the LED array, divide that into 6.
That will give you the resistor size in ohms that you need to place in
series with the LED's. You will need to calculate the required wattage
also.
formula is w = (I squared) R or E*I
Example:

6V/0.1A = 60 Ohms.
E* I = 6V * .1A = .6W, buy a 1W minimum resistor, recommend using at
least double the calculated size so for this example, buy a 2 watt
unit.

&gt; My plan (Real Soon Now) is to get one of those red LED third-light
&gt; units, a 6-to-12 converter, and mount it along the bottom of the
rear
&gt; window.  Considering that LEDs really only need 1.2 volts to
operate,
&gt; I may be able to rewire it to work on six instead of 12 directly,
&gt; which would be even better.  The hard part is figuring out how to
run
&gt; the wires (don't want long lines, don't want to cut holes, etc).
