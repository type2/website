Oooh, Oooh, My turn.

In my garage
by Charles Mowrey

I have a 69 ghia vert waiting on resurrection. I have my '57 ragtop oval
(Driver, and his name is Germy), and my friends '71 standard beetle. I have
a 1940 GE shop refrigerator that STILL WORKS, and a stove (I keep promising
myself the Eastwood Powder coat kit, but I keep buying things like
Semaphores, and stuff). I have 20' of countertops in the back, with pegboard
(NO! I don't draw lines around my tools!!). On the counter top resides one
really strong running engine without any tin destined to be in my buddies
bug one day. One set of early bug popouts for my oval, one set of NOS bullet
turn signals (bug) and one really good used set of bullets for a bus.  An
early standard 3 spoke steering wheel, and an oval steering wheel, both
waiting on restoration also sit there looking sad. I have two antique fire
extinguishers (both full and ready) within easy reach, and about 4 pairs of
safety glasses laying around. One shop radio, one large upright compressor,
a small mig welder, various air tools, jackstands, floor jacks, creepers, a
huge vice, bench grinder, vw engine stand, an old transmission used for
starting engines on the bench, and more parts than I like to admit to.
Outside is parked my '65 panel (double door walkthru, and his name is
Cooter) bus. I plan on using my new sandblaster on him, then welding in new
panels (Anyone have a good set of front doors?).

I want to be the first Type II in my local VW club ( www_dot_cajunvw_dot_com ) and
plan on doing a quick and dirty resto on the bus this winter. I also have 1
squareback, and 2 ghias out back that are for parts. We don't call them
junk, its called YARD ART damnit!!

Well, there's actually even more in my 30'x30' paradise, but this is already
too long winded. heh :)

Subject: [VB] What's in your garage?


&gt; It's finally friday and I'd like to pursue the topic I proposed a couple
of
&gt; days ago.
&gt; Namely &quot;What's in your garage?&quot; Based on my own experience, I realized
long
&gt; ago that my garage will probably never hold my &quot;daily driver&quot;. In my
garage
&gt; now resides the following:
&gt; A 1961 ragtop beetle &quot;off the pan&quot; on the right side, with the beetle pan
on
&gt; the left side.
&gt; Piled on top of that, two aftermarket floor pans, two complete sets of
&gt; engine tin for a 1500, three 6V starters, and various other engine parts.
&gt; Between the beetle and it's pan sit an air compressor, oxy-acatelyne
welding
&gt; set up and a mig welder.
&gt; To round out the clutter, there's various lawn chairs, a dog cage, gas
cans
&gt; and at least three trash bags full of crushed beer cans waiting to be
cashed
&gt; in.
&gt; In the driveway, sits my '66 Westy along with a '64 beetle convertible
&gt; (non-runner) and an '81 rabbit convertible (son's daily driver).
&gt; My wife's has long ago given up the idea of parking anywhere but on the
&gt; street.
&gt; John
