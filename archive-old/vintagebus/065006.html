&gt; hey george could you post s picture of this split ring you are talking
&gt; about?

Not now.  I'll try to borrow a camera and do so, If I can get a good shot.
It's really simple, though.  Just cut the 16ga metal into a strip a half
inch or so wide, bend it so that it matches the OD of the pipe around half
the pipe.  Make a second part exactly the same way.  Force both half-rings
into the enlarged hole in the box so that a quarter-inch of the ring
protrudes.  Braze the half-rings to the heater box.

&gt; I had a similar problem with my heater boxes-and when irecently had the bus
out, I thought I would do something about it, I got some of that epoxy type
 putty, that you basically cut, rub together in your hands, then put in
 place, sets in supposedly about 5 minutes-seemed to take a bit longer.
 Anyway-it seemed nice and secure, but after picking my engine up a few
 times, and shiftig it around...they eventually loosened up. Not sure if this
 was due to improper prep of heater box surface...so the putty stuff is still
 there, i think it is doing a better job blocking the gaps, but it is not
&gt; sealed completely yet.

I don't think any epoxy will withstand the tailpipe temperatures.  You
need metal for that.

&gt; oh yeah, as for finishing them, i degreased, and painted with this engine
&gt; enamel in a spray paint can, paint color &quot;New F*rd Gray&quot; pretty decent
&gt; looking gray.

That should do fine.
