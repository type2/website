Subject: Re: [VB] Whats this wire? (BN4 Heater)

Ark Mirvis in NJ has diaphrams. (Look in links on
vintagebus_dot_com or on VW Planet). I think he was asking
$55.00 for them so i was going to try to fab my own
using directions from type2_dot_com.
More than likely you diaphram is shot but try pulling
apart the fuel pump and cleaninig it out. they tend to
freeze up if not used for a while. It worked with the
ones i have!

&gt; Talking about BN-4s, I was thinking I should get one
&gt; going and put it in a 
&gt; bus while I have some time.    Mine the fuel pump is
&gt; dead (surprise).  What 
&gt; was that sources for buying modern fuel pumps for
&gt; the eberspacher?  Was it 
&gt; from espar, the modern incarnation of eberspacher?
&gt; 
&gt; definately before installing the heater (if it is
&gt; out) test it on a bench.   
&gt; I did this hooking ground to ground and positive to
&gt; positive.  Two wires have 
&gt; to have electricity to start the heater.  one is
&gt; always on, one you turn it 
&gt; on .   Then what happened is my blower motor blew,
&gt; but it did not sucks gas 
&gt; out of the gas can.   er, I would have to look at
&gt; the heater again to be more 
&gt; specific on which wire is what.   there is the
&gt; wiring diagram on the web at 
&gt; one of those obsolete VW document sites

&gt;  OK folks,
&gt;  Got a Bn4 and I dont know what one wire is.  Coming
&gt; off of the fuel pump 
&gt; there is a red wire that goes to a bolt on the
&gt; bracket, at this braket the 
&gt; wire has a &quot;y&quot; and becomes 2 wires, one wire goesi
&gt; nto the body of the 
&gt; heater, the other eone is hanging loos with no
&gt; connectoer on the end.  WHERE 
&gt; DOES THIS WIRE GO???  Anticipating heat, John Baker
