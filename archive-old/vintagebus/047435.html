Hi Ivan,
Congrats on your recently acquired 59 panel.  Since it sat for two years make 
sure to change the oil immeadiately if you have not done so already.  Oil 
even if run in an engine for only five minutes begins to degrade and will 
turn in about six months into a highly acidic state that will attack the 
engine parts.  Also any dirt and sludge suspended in used oil will settle out 
coating the bottom of the engine case with thick sludge.  When starting an 
engine with these problems the sludge will begin to loosen up and possibly 
clogged bearings from getting oil ruining the engine.  This especially 
happens if the engine is taken out and driven at high RPMs on the highway for 
long periods.  Best to only drive it in town (Stop and go traffic is best.)  
For half an hour or less here and there for the first 300-500 miles to allow 
the engine to break back in and work the sludge out slowly.  Also during this 
300-500 mile period change the oil every 50 miles or at least until the oil 
stops turn black.   Eric&amp;Barb
