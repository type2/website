&gt; Hey - great page man!  I have to admit it makes me love my bus more because
&gt; I don't think my rust is near that bad.  :-)  Good luck on the resto man -
&gt; looks like you'll need it! :-)
thanks NQ,

really it looks worse than it is... its mainly surface rust.  As for rust
through, there is the 3 holes in the rockers, and maybe a couple little
ones in the front floor.

outriggers, floor, jack points, etc. are all solid.  I saw this bus jacked
up from the jack points with my own eyes, nothing gave or even creaked!

but, as i tear into things, it may grow worse ;)

peas,

Steve
