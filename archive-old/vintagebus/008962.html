Subject: What is needed for 12V conversion?

I know this is an OLD OLD topic but in lieu of the latest discussion about
gas guages and voltages, I'm finding there is a lot more to doing the
conversion right that I had first imagined.  So much so as a matter of fact,
that I'm really tempted to run 2 - 6 volt batteries so I can have 12v for a
stereo but keep everything else in the bus stock.  In the event I do go 12v,
here is a list so far that I have compiled and I hope that if there is
anything left out, that you listees will add to it.  Please email me at
silent_at_beatricene_dot_com if you want to:

All light bulbs must be replaced with 12v bulbs (dome lights, headlights,
park lights)
Radio (if applicable) must be run with a volt-a-drop or big mother
heatsinked commercial grade resistor installed in line
12v windshield wiper (convert with those variable speed 12v to 6v drop
gizmos)
Gas guage
All bulbs in the speedo housing must be replaced
Starter changed to a 12v (using an auto stick starter is cheaper and
prevents starter bushing hassles.)
Voltage regulator - especially if converting to an alternator
12v flywheel and ground out tranny housing

I think I got it all but what have I missed?

Thanks for reading!
