&gt; Check out http:www.whitepost_dot_com. They do good work on brake cylinders - they
&gt; press in brass sleeves into existing brake cylinders.  No more rust..

I sent them off a request for a quote on having my 61 brake cylinders
sleeved &amp; rebuilt just to get an idea of price.

They wanted $80.00 per each.

Anyhow with new german being $30.00 each this isnt such a bargain there...
but i wonder if this would be a bargain to a barndoor owner... considering
they have a hard time even finding cylinders that can be rebuilt.  Better
to pay 80X4 than have your brakes go out because you are running cylinders
you know are out of spec...

anyway, just thought i'd report and maybe save someone some time.

take care,

Steve
