Subject: Re: [VB] turn signal question

ok, i have been somewhat corrected, although i had not heard of it, nor
experienced it on any of my vehicles. 
printed in bentley is: &quot;the new clutch lever (meaning straight--jon) and
the wing nut can only be subsequently installed if the transmission case
and the left final drive cover are replaced.&quot; M-26,page 2 although i don't
know why you'd have to replace the case too....oh wait.. i think it may
have to do with the side covers with o-rings?
hey, ya learn something new every day.

&gt; &gt;&gt; also, on pre 70 busses, can you switch the 11mm and 14mm nuts on the 
&gt; clutch 
&gt; &gt; release lever to a wing nut? &lt;&lt;
&gt; 
&gt; Yes, and no.  The earlier clutch cables have smaller thread size on the
rear 
&gt; end.  To install the wing nut you need a later clutch cable the same
length 
&gt; as the earlier one with it's larger thread size to fit.  You can if you
grind 
&gt; off the nubs on the forward side of the wingnut to match the earlier
style 
&gt; and use it with the earlier style curved arm.  So far for us in our 1960 
&gt; panel camper we have had over five years this way with no noticable
backing 
&gt; off due to having no lock nut.  Do not just install the later straight
clutch 
&gt; arm without changing the left axle side plate first.  Otherwise the end
of 
&gt; the cable is moved out of alignment and the clutch cable wears badly on
the 
&gt; end of the boden tube.  We found out the hard way with two 6,000 to
10,000 
&gt; mile clutch cables that wore out on the end of the boden tube instead of
the 
&gt; usual 30,000+ lifespan clutch cables we usually got before and have
gotten 
&gt; since this little experiment.   Eric&amp;Barb


[Original message before above]
you can switch to the wing nut, but you must also change the arm. if you
use the early arm with a wing nut there is nothing for the wingnut to
&quot;lock&quot; into and adjustment will be a constant issue, as the wingnut will
loosen itself. the later arm has a diamond shaped space for the wingnut to
&quot;lock&quot; itself in place. and yes, there is a correct way to put the arm on,
either early or late.
