&gt; need gl4 75-90 or straight 90 for my trans, I will settle for either. I
live
&gt; in PA, and can't find it anywhere. Please advise to mail order source, or
&gt; someother way to get it...I have called farm tractor stores, all the auto
&gt; parts houses (most haven't a clue), and am often told to use the gl5. I
want
&gt; to be safer than sorry, even if I am wrong, please help with source! Will
&gt; pay to have shipped (1 or 2 gal) to me.....
