Subject: Redux bearings, How to Remove?
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

Fellow Bussers,

In the process of replacing the seals on the redux boxes, I discovered that the bearings on the passenger side were shot. I split the box and the 2 outer bearings fell apart!

The local VW shop believes he has the bearings, but I am having trouble removing the inner races from either of the 2 outer bearings. I removed the lock ring on the upper one. Neither one will come off, prying with 2 screwdrivers. Any suggestions?

BTW, as some of you know, I've been out of commission for the last couple of weeks, and I'm feeling much better now, thanks.

david
