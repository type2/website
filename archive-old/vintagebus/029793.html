It sounds like you have the correct setup for the 1967 muffler.  The
dampener pipe comes straight back through the 'divot', make a 90 degree
turn to the driver's side, then the tailpipe fits on the dampener and
the end of that makes another 90 degree turn to the rear to poke out a
few inches, underneath the end of the bumper.  You should have 2 circle
clamps and a dampener support bracket to go with this setup.

&gt; In the process of assembling the exhaust I bought and have installed a
&gt; bus muffler, silencer and tailpipe.  All well and good.  The mystery is
&gt; that the silencer and tail pipe run over to the driver's side of the bus
&gt; and then point rearward.  Now, the valance for the '67 has a divot cut
&gt; into it that looks like the silencer for this year of bus originally came
&gt; straight back from the muffler, like a bug peashooter. I am willing to bet
&gt; that the muffler, silencer and tailpipe I bought were really made for a
&gt; '68-71 bus with a T1 engine and not a splittie.
&gt; 
&gt; Now a bug peashooter does not fit in the hole in my muffler for the
&gt; silencer, so if it did look like this, then it was a special peashooter
&gt; for the bus only.  Did this exist? does it? or was the '67 muffler special
&gt; in having a tube off the muffler that fit a bug peashooter? If so, does
&gt; there exist a single outlet (bus) muffler with an outlet that will fit a
&gt; bug peashooter?
