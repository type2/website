Subject: 63 Double cab?

had the pleasure of meeting Dave &amp; Carol from Portland
Or, this morning. Dave has a &quot;really&quot; clean 63? double
cab.

 its a rare site to see a split, let alone a double
cab this far from the city.
 The bridge crossing the river is two narrow lane's
and was built in 1926.
 I have this vision of seeing how many busses could
line up on it.....Dave's cream &amp; green bus looked so
right there on the bridge this morning.

  off I go to inquire if he was a list member... Yep!
he say's. 

made me day!
