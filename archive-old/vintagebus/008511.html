Subject: Re: [VB] 21 vs 23 - which is more rare

&gt; Which is more rare: a 21-window or a 23-window?
&gt; &lt;snip of some good info&gt;
&gt;
According to the &quot;Samba&quot; production counts on my site, which are a
conglomeration of various sources, 23s come in at about 65,000 total
production, 21s at around 60,000 so it's pretty close.  (Estimated)

I've seen more 23s at shows but I've seen way more 21s overall.

In my limited travels, I've seen a lot more OG paint or 80-90% all original
21s than 23s.

I wonder if those counts include Hardtop Deluxes, 15-window Deluxes are
definitely more rare than 13-window Deluxes.
