Was writ:
SOTO meet at the Duck Pond, Anaheim, CA?

It's a NEATO meet! NEATO! NEATO! NEATO!

NEATO is the bus club that has a newsletter and does stuff.  SOTO is the club
that...  What do they do anyway?

I don't mean to sound anal, It's just that the people in NEATO work very hard
to provide a timely newsletter, emergency road assistance, swaps, shows and
campouts throughout the world.  One of the chapters, the Arizona Bus Club,
donates money to some great causes.
