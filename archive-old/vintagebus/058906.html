I'm in the market for a sandblaster.  Being a thrifty bus owner I really
don't want to spend too much money - but I do want a good sandblaster.  So
what would be my best option?  I used a friends before that was about 3 feet
high and filled from the top and was sort of locked closed before using.  It
was probably all I need but ... who sells em? 

TIA
