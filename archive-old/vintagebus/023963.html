From the 1964 Clymers Manual Transporter Owner's Handbook (covers all
commercial vehicles) 3rd Edition (includes 1500 engine).

	It references 12V being available in Emergency vehicles (Ambulances and
Firewagens) prior to 1960...

	It also has a section about the 1500sp engine (surprisingly all
pictures are of a type III Notchback with flat motor and single
sidedraft carb)...

	My '63 Standard Microbus (production date May 31st, 1963) has M-codes
for both 12V and 1500sp... Also has M-codes for: walk-thru and sealed
beam headlight &amp; red taillight lenses.  Was German delivery, so suspect
it was special ordered by US Serviceman with the intention of bringing
back at end of tour...

	Now I know that Clymers were never 100% accurate, but this manual has
more info about early Transporter/Commercial vehicles than many other
more recent publications...

	Take Care...
