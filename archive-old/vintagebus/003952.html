&gt;I'm trying to find out what antennas were available for barndoors.  I
&gt;have one in my posession that is purported to be a barndoor antenna, but
&gt;if it were placed on the nose of my bus, say just above the emblem,
&gt;it would protrude *forward* at about a 30 degree angle to the vertical
&gt;plane of the nose.
&gt;
Here's an image with the antenna collapsed and extended:

pg

It appears to be parallel to the windshield angle with a rubber mount on
the roof itself, not on the pillar.

Were the radios and antennas factory-installed or left up to the dealers?
I can see just see 'ol Gunter out there on the showroom floor with a big
drill digging into that pristine Barn Door nose...  Oh, the humanity!

Anyway, I say go hardcore and weld it on at a kewl angle and top it with a
Jack-In-the-Box antenna ball.  :)

Later,
