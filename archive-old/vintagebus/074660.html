Subject: Need contact info...

Hi all,

I wonder if anyone has the current street address and/or e-mail contact for
Michael Steinke near Frankfurt, Germany.  A buddy wants to contact him about
Westfalia trailer parts and info, and we figure he's 'da man...  Thanks for
any leads.  By the way, anyone out there have any spare Westfalia trailer
rims???
