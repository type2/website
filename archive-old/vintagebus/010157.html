Matthew and all who responded, I am overwelmed with the thoughtfulness and
knowledge within the ranks.  Sorry it has taken so long to get back to all.
These Pocketmail devices are great but some phone systems make it difficult
to download.

The mechanic ordered a hose from Fallon.  It arrived the following day via
UPS.  The hose DID NOT fit so he mickeymoused it and I drove out of Austin
scared to death that the same thing would happen.  I made it to Capitol Reef
National Park and it's still working.

One guy along the way said a sensor that makes the fan run isn't working so
that will begin another story.

I must say, if something like this needs to happen I was fortunate that it
happened at the service station that the people were so helpful.  They let
me spend the night in their parking lot, checked to make sure I was okay.
Next morning a very nice lady came with a thermos of coffee and was
surprised to see I already had mine plus was making toast (on my coffe can
toaster).  I offered her some and I'm sure I was the topic of conversation
of the day.  Local people stopped by and thus the time passed quickly.

I keep fingers crossed and hope to make the complete trip, ending up in
Idaho with a gathering of about 50 single RV'ers, of whom I am the only VW
in the group. Gathering is near Orofino, so Matthew if any single VW people
want to join these old fogies, just yell!!!!  Needless to say, I do take
quite a bit of kidding!!!

Again, thanks to all.  I've copied down many of the resources and may check
in on the Las Vegas people, especially if a sensor is needed.  Thank you one
and all!  Please forward to Vanagon list where so many responses came in.
Bev Beam, on the road, headed to Bryce, Zion and t. George for the outdoor
theatre!!!
