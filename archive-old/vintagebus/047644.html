i had one of those days.

well I sorted out a few things on my 65 yesterday-   touch up the scratches
on the rear bumper, put it on the bus, re jet the carb ( from 125 to 135 air
correction,   forget what I did with the main jet wrote it somewhere) ,
Duncan helped me put the roof rack back on it, the pre heat hose didn't get
hooked up with the air cleaner being on the other side of the motor from the
61 the hose wasn't long enough.  Okay, it can wait till I get another hose,
though I do like the pre heat.

Drove up to seattle in the after nooon to avoid rush hour traffic.  saw three
(3) dead bugs by the side of the road.  It was hot-- around 70F.  and a dead
type 3 as well.  no dead other cars, just VWs.   this is odd, they are
dropping like flys.

parked in town and wasted time at a bookstore.  when I got back a bay window
bus was parked in front of my camper, it had a 'I beat up 4 hippies and all I
got was this dumb VW bus' sticker on it.  :)

my bus wont start.

not even a click.   Starts fine with jump wire in engine compartment.

went to the burgermaster for the bus meeting, but no one had shown up by 7pm,
so i guess it got moved again.  what a waste of time.

Filled up part way home, and had better milage, about 3 or 4 more MPG.  was
it the jetting, or maybe just the installatio of the missing U piece?   Hm?

Got home close to midnight (after work), and was almost there when the left
hand dash warning light came on.    Generator.  It pulsated, went off, I
pulled over, slight odd smell in engine compartment  (rubber burning?)  but
fan belt was fine, I had put in new generator brushes the other day, suspect
the regulator, okay can drive on battery)  Should adjust clutch a tad and why
does the heat not shut off?     As I pulled in the driveway I was  thinking
food, food, food, beer?, but a minute after I walk in the phone rings and
Duncan's bus had a flat tire on the way back from Portland the bus is 10
miles south of oly, but he's near downtown with his little son.    (hitched
to town)  Les schwab had torqued the lug nuts on so tight.....
  Okay, I pile  my heavy duty tire removal tools in the bug, and a can of gas
as the gas guage read below R,  and drive to downtown.   I get just over a
mile and it dies.

I pull over, and dump a gallon of gas in.  It doesn't help.   run the
starter.  Yes the tank is far from the motor.  I am frustrated.  it's late.
i'm hungry.   i am supposedly going to help someone else with a broken down
volkswagen.   Bugster shouldn't do this.  I run the starter a while.   I look
at the motor for loose wires.   Someone slows down and asks if I need help.
I get a ride home, get the bus, and stop by the bug and get the tire tools.

On the way downtown  the smell of wierd burning rubber is stronger.   The
dash light is on.   I pull over, everything looks okay back there, but I
disconnect teh voltage regulator.    Start the bus again (wire in back to
battery), and go downtown.

the smell seems less

Pick up the refugees from the dead tire, and head south.   I wonder how long
I can drive off the battery with my headlights on.  w/o lights it can be done
across several states.    wyoming to nevada at least.     Find the bus w/ bad
tire,  I park behind it.   WIth the industrial tire tools I stomp the lug
nuts loose.  Skreek   skreek.    Duncan makes comments about what he'd like
to do with a torque wrench to the guy who put his tire on.     Big trucks are
driving perilously close to us on the side of I -5.  I put on my E flashers.
 Yes, it eats my battery, but saftey is important.   Vehicles now often pull
into the lane away from the VWs as they go past.   Kid fell asleep on the
front seat of the camper, and is blissfully unaware of all of this.

The tire is switched,   and I am worried about if I have enough juice to
drive home on (15 miles about)  He follows me.    I am shocked by the
loudness of that motor.  Get a muffler.  dude.  adjust those valves.   like i
can talk.    we  Drive north.   My headlights get dimmer and dimmer and
dimmer and dimmer.   Make it home.
