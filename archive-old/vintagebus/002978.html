I also felt a need to respond to that post - there sure is a lot o' world
north of the 49 parallel.  I do though think Winnipeg might be a little
farther north than Vancouver - it certianly is a lot colder.  I have seen
early buses in Fort St. John, BC and I know there are some in Edmonton, Ab.
I bet the northern most listees in from some place like Finland - aren't
there some Finnish listees?  There is an AIRS member in Yellowknife, NWT,
but he has a 72 - I can't imagine there are very many bus owners further
north than him.

I bet there are no other listees from a colder climate than Manitoba in the
winter.

&gt; &gt; Well, I think Kanadia is farther North than Minnesota.  Vancouver, BC,
&gt; &gt; Kanadia.  Probably not the Northernmost listee, but close!

&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; But seriously, I'm in the Twin Cities, Minnesota, 45 degrees latitude.
&gt; &gt; &gt; Prolly not the most northern, but at least I got in first...!
