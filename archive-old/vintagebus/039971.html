I removed all the sundial stuff last night and will have to rebuild alot of 
the wood due to water damage and fading from the sun.  I will be making 
templates to post on my sundial site during this proces.  I found lots of 
old pennies and dimes, some old safeway game peices and a ton of s and h 
green stamps.  Should I paint the aluminum on the Jealousy windows or just 
clean it up?  Anyone need any original glass?  I also need to locate some 
vintage formica for the water tank top.

Bart
