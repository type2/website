Subject: Re: [VB] Auxillary battery/Alternative Entertainment

I hear ya! I have no kids (that I know of!) but were I to be so employed, there would never be a TV in the car. Period.

 Long trips are good for books. Does anyone remember those? They were good for me, my parents when they were young and they will be good enough for my kids.
