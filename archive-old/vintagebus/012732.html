&gt;Has anyone thought about using scratch and abrasion resistant plexiglass &gt;or
lexan to replace a windshield? Lexan (if thick enough) will stop a &gt;bullet.

&gt;Feedback?????


Doesn't Lexan scratch easily?  After a while, the windshield wipers will leave
their tracks, I think.  Glass is much further up on the hardness scale.  Like
a file, you wouldn't pry on something with it, but you can file things
(cutting action) with it, and the thing you are filing wears down, not the
file.  Sand, grit, etc are HARDER than Lexan.

Maybe (mebbe) you can use Rain-X!
