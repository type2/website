Subject: Doublecab for sale
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

Listees,
Got a call tonight here in Albuquerque from a fellow who's got a doublecab 
for sale.  Since I already have one, here's the skinny:
1964 Dblcab, new paint over &quot;recent bodywork&quot; - two weeks until buff out.
He put in the current 1600 12V and cut the bellhousing.
Runs, gates are apparently very rusty.
He's asking $4k and that's what he's got in it.
Call him at 505-892-3047 or e-mail &quot;dshodean_at_aol_dot_com&quot;.
If this works for you, drop me a line.
JP
