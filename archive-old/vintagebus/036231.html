 Anyway, there is an article reprinted from the Muir guide as well as one
 dealing with the factory production in Puebla, Mexico.  The average age of
 the workers was 21 and it shows them putting VW Things together.  The
 article goes on to say that Things originally came with reduction boxes but
 were replaced with IRS suspensions later on.
 
 My question is this:  Does anyone know what the gearing on Things was and
 how it compared to the last year of the reduction boxes on 1967 buses?  Any
 increase in the ratios?
 
 All fer now...
  &gt;&gt;
I think the things w/ RGBoxes had 4.37s, but who knows?  please tell.  The 
interesting thing is that a good number of them came with limited slip 
differentials.
