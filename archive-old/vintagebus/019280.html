Subject: westy roof rach resto
To: type2 &lt;vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com&gt;

Does anyone know what westfalia used to plate the
metal cross bow's on there wood slat rack?  Is that
galvinized, sinc, cad...?

Anyone have either of the two ID tags for the roof
rack that they would like to sell?  this is for a mid
60's rack.  No slope in the leg's.

Lastly, i will search the archives but any have the
post's from some time ago about the dimentions of the
wood and it's finish?

Thanks

MAtt
