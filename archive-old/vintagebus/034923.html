&lt;&lt; I am thinking (?) I need to get some sealant inside lip and a bead around 
outside.  I have at my disposal syringes to make this possible.  Can anyone 
with prior experience help me out with a product and/or advice before I 
drown?  &gt;&gt;

Roofing tar is the only material we have used that has not let us down inside 
of 18 months like all of the other sealants we tried.   Eric&amp;Barb
