&lt;&lt; I also need a single-port intake manifold, without a blocked heat riser 
tube, for this Bus. Does anyone out there have one for sale, or know where I 
could get one? &gt;&gt;
Hi Chris,
First you need to figure out which intake manifold you are going to use the 
part number is on the front side almost against the fanshroud.  The 1964-67 
buses used a bus only part, while the 1968-71 used ones that were for both 
type 1, &amp; 2.  Then there are even single port, &amp; dual port.  Or you might 
just use kerosene, and a piece of cut off clutch cable to drill in reverse 
out the crud.   Eric&amp;Barb
