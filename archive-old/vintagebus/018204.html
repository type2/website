Subject: early parts?????
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

hello all, 

I went anf looked a a parts bus today. It was complete
but basicly rust holding hands. It is an early bus,
has little round tail lights , bullet turn signals and
the vin plate in the motor compartment resembled the
ones Ive seen on oval and split beetles, but i couldnt
make out the # due to poor lighting. its not a
barndoor. are there any parts i should pull besides
the obvious. how about brake drums?
 Thanks----Bryan
