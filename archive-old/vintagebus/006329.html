The Omaha Volkswagen Club and Vintage Volkswagen Club of America,
Present:
 2001:  A Volkswagen Odyssey
with proceeds going to benefit the American Cancer Society
on Saturday, July 21st, 2001.
Located in the northwest parking lot of Westroads Mall in Omaha, Nebraska.
This is the largest Volkswagen auto show in Nebraska.  - There will be a car
show, swap meet,  new parts vendors and lots of exciting door prizes to be
given away.  1st, 2nd, and 3rd Place Trophies will be awarded for air-cooled
and water-cooled Volkswagens and entry fee is only $15 per car. All
Volkswagens, regardless of condition and year, are welcomed.  Registration
begins at 8:00 am and there will be donation spectator admission and free
parking.

There is also VW camping at the KOA by Gretna NE on both Friday and Sat
night with a caravan to the show
You can still come in something other than a VW but we would like to keep
the VW's together for pictures
Please try to RSVP to Terry Wolfe at wolfe_at_tconl_dot_com so we have some idea as
to how big this is going to be.
For additional information:
please contact the web site at www.omahavwclub_dot_com or Rob Laffoon at

Anything  that you can donate to the club for the show raffles would be
greatly appreciated.
