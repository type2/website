Subject: RE: [VB] Rikki James/Outlaw

Between Rikki James and John Jones a new era of buses is starting to evolve.
pure customs, true quality. If only the people who did some of the so called
restorations I have seen spent as much time there would be a lot of Quality
done buses out there. There is nothing wrong with Original buses, true
restored buses, reconditioned buses (most of them out there) or the TRUE
customs, just as long as there done with QUALITY in mind. I for one am one
of the reconditioned bus drivers, also have my 100% original driver and am
working on my TRUE mild custom (done right, like Dave Mayes) double cab.
  In closing all I can say is GO RIKKI GO and I'm sure John Jones won't be
far behind. I allready know his new project!
