JP and I were talking about this at the RT66 splits meeting last night.
The trouble is that early doglegs seem to be very hard to find.  Greg
Noble I believe had a set a while back I missed out on by not jumping
right in.  I've been keeping my eyes open for a passenger side one for
several years and haven't found one even though I don't scour the Samba
ads every day and I don't get around the bus circles that much.
Seems like doglegs are one of the first things to rust out.  Someday I
might consider repro, but we would all rather have OG.
I'm glad it's Jon's delimma and not mine.:)
