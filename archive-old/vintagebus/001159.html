Tonight I went out to the shop and did the full blown plastiguage test.  I
was able to get a strip of the green stuff for $1.49 from Autozone a couple
of days ago.  I marked each rod, each bearing, and placed it on the
appropriate journal and I'm pleased to say that every single journal checked
out at .002 on the dot - no ands ifs or buts.  Now if that ain't an omen, I
don't know what is!

Next I checked the situation with the heads and the cylinders.  If you'll
recall, there is about a .003&quot; step between the 85.5 cut of the stock head
and the 90.5 cut for the bigger jugs.  The thickness of the jugs is about
.1475&quot; and the width of the outer lip on the head (the actual surface that
mates to the top of the cylinder) is .1040&quot;  All this gobbledegook means
that the lip of the cylinder will seat across .1040&quot; but come up .0435&quot;
short of a full seal across the full face of the lip/edge/top of the
cylinder.  Is this anything to worry about?  I've been in touch with my
machinist and he's more than willing to redo the heads if necessary.  At
this point, I'm really indifferent - I'll go with whatever general list
concensus is.  Later!
