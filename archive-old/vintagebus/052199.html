Subject: RE: [VB] Lug nut taps and dies...

I believe they are 14x1.5mm yes?  The key is that lug threads are not a
'normal' thread as there are specs to thread clearances.  I think Eric&amp;Barb
once posted the correct thread designation.  I'd look to MSC or
McMaster-Carr for the tools.

Bill pondered: ... I've always wanted to locate
and buy a die and tap to be able to repair any lug nuts and their holes in
the drums for both my older Busses and my Beetles.  Offhand, does anyone
know the correct size and thread pitch to order taps and dies for the pre
1968 Type 2 Busses and also for the 1950's Type 1 Beetle's?
