 The latest and LAST change to the route. We changed the route so Ronnie can
deliver the deluxe bus to Yucca Vally and had planned to drive through
Joshua Tree park to the Patton tank museums and meet every one from Phoenix.
BUT they want $15 per car/bus to drive through the park. THE NEW PLAN is to
meet at the dinosaurs in Cabazon Calif and leave at 10 AM from there.
Everyone and anyone from the west knows where the dinosaurs are in Cabazon.
We will get there around 9 Am and eat and gas up and wait for the
Phoenix group. Will leave at 10 AM sharp ( Oh Yea ) and go to CTI, where
Ronnie will lead the caravan to Lenny's party for those who want to go. The
rest of us will stay and party. Any ??? email me or Ronnie. Sorry for all
the changes, but this should work for everyone. We will be on CB channel 2
and my cell # is 520 715-5088 so call if lost or whatever. Oil changed and
new bulbs in  the idiot lights, ready to go. Bringing a ???cc Moto Guzie
motor for Moe in the Single wheel trailor, looks good setting in there. See
you all there or somewhere.

John Howard
