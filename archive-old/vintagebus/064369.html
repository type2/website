Subject: Recond'n front door panels or source for carmel brown vinyl

So I'm attempting to recondition my front door panels.  I pulled em off a
month or so ago and now they look like pretzels.  So I'll wash em down and
then lie em flat to dry ... but I was thinking ... I could just cut some new
ones and rivet my door pockets on em ... but I'd like to be able to cover em
in similar vinyl to stock.  Anyone know of a source?
