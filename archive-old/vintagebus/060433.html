Subject: BAD MOTOR FINDINGS-ACADIA_BUS SIGHTING

Sigtings in ME,
Farmington, ME, a nice red/white 21 window. Saw you at a NAPA, real nice
bus.
Shop in Belfast ME, 21 windows, cut wells, hippie paint from 1971?.
Panel, rusted bad
Camper , decent interior, rattle primer. Both of the above were dead,
the hippie 21 ran.

ACADIA was sweet, ggod camping, even in the rain. Stowe, VT was great
also, but no splitties there to be seen.

Well, the VW BOB motor got some diagnosis today. Set valve lash, hmm not
tight, loose! .008 set to .006. Fired and checked dwell, 50... Then to
timing, WTF?! The damn light doesn't work, test on ghia, yes, it does.
Back to bus, hmm, no trigger. Touch wire, wire falls off, no clip guts
to wire, damm. Get new wire. Remove plug to get top clip from old wire.
WELL THE HELICOILS THE GUY USED WIGGLES RIGHT OUT!, VOLKS&lt; THIS THING IS
LOOSING COMPRESSION FORM THE SPARK PLUG HOLES! DAMMIT, never unscrewed a
helicoil with my bare hands, and I'm no hercules. I've now lost all
faith in this mill. Perhaps a teardown and good heads might save the
day, but it's likely I will still be relucant of the rest of the short
block's workmanship.




Needless to say, I will tear this out to short block, and see if she can
be a good spare for an airs ER or something. We want to X country this
bus in a couple years, so I need a good engine, not BOB's mystery
junkyard shite. Going to check the finances and start poking around.
Raby's turnkeys sound nice, and well documented and tested, I think
that's a way to go. Does anyone have a mill built by him? Seems to have
a tight ship running, and strives for quality, that's what I need right
now...
Al 66 DLX, with currently 3 cyl 1600, with leaky shite helicoils on a
1750 miles rebuild. Nice.
