I am posting this to the Lists to see If I can get empirical data to use dry
ice when camping in a bus?
Johns questions are included below

Hi John

You know, I didn't have great results with the dry ice,, mostly from my
ignorance,
I got 5 lbs of dry ice for $10 u.s.  and it came in an insulated paper
bag...
I put the bag of ice in a cooler with a 30 / 70 partition, and put the beer
and the soda on the bigger side of the partition, separated from the bag by
air and a plastic divider.
I didn't put any regular ice in ..... well,,It got so cold in there that a
couple cans burst.
maybe if i had burried the cans in regular ice,, that would have insulated
them from the severe cold of the dry ice, and the dry ice would have kept
the reg ice

It did last longer than reg ice,, as I had it from Thurs afternoon till
about sat afternoon,
but I guess this depends on alot of factors,, and EveryBus wasn't the
Hottest weeekend to test its endurance.


I was dissappointed because,
I didn't know how to keep the food, beverages from getting tooo cold
I thought it would last till sunday, (I should have picked it up friday if i
wanted it to last till sunday)

I was happy because
The kids got a science lesson
it evaporates with no water to dump out of the cooler
the food packages don't get soggy

 Can anyone edu-macate me ?
Thanks

&gt;Hi Jamie,
&gt;
&gt;I remember you had some dry ice in your cooler at everybus. I'm getting
&gt;ready to do some camping in the heat of the summer and I was wondering
&gt;about this dry ice trick. How much do you use per cooler? How long does
&gt;it last? Do you use regular ice with it? (I'm betting you do) How much
&gt;regular ice do you have to buy to keep the cooler filled?
&gt;
&gt;Just as a reference, I usually have to buy three bags of ice a day for
&gt;the two coolers I use. That starts to add up over the course of a week
&gt;at $2.00 per bag.
&gt;
&gt;TIA for your help.
&gt;John
