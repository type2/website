&gt; here are  the numbers off the 54? barndoor delux I just bought
&gt; behind seat   110 690
&gt; serial number on title   112 412
&gt;
Behind the seat is the body #.

Serial # on the title sounds like the VIN #, especially given that body #,
double check the 20-XXX XXX stamp on the right side of the engine
compartment and the stamp on the VIN plate above it.

The last Bus produced in Dec., 1954 was 20-110603
The last Bus produced in Jan., 1955 was 20-114525

so...  you have a Jan., 1955 Deluxe, 1955 model!

My Bus is 112 737 , built on Jan. 24, 1955 so yours was probably made about
2-3 days earlier, pretty neat.

Pim Van Loon has the address on his site at http://www.ploon.nl where you
can send your VIN # and 20DM to the factory and get all the data on your
Bus.
