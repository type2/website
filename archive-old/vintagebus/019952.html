&gt; First off, the PO had lowered the bus with a busboy albatross beam.  That
&gt; was fairly simple to rectify.  But I am having difficulties with the rear.
&gt; In crawling in there and looking around, it doesn't appear that anything has
&gt; been modified.  It all looks stock and has the typical layer of road crud.
&gt; So how might one lower the rear without replacing things.

By indexing the torsion bars.

&gt; After reading Pauls post regarding the angle of the spring plate in his 59,
&gt; I am thinking that this might be how it was lowered.  Any other ideas on
&gt; what I might check to get the rear back to normal height?

Get a magnetic protractor thingie from Harbor Fright and figger out where
it's supposed to be, and go to it.

I vote for getting the correct setup and either installing a voltage drop,
or changing out the armature for a 12v one.

Over time, buses tend to develope random holes.
