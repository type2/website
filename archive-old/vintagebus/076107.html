Subject: 1961 Double Cab... 06-27-03

Didn't get a UPS order today, really didn't expect to either. So I 
hopped in the truck and drove it around the neighborhood real quick. 
I ended up pulling it under the carport for the weekend.

I noticed how annoying the over stuffed front bench seat was. I tried 
the Porsche 914 seats in there and actually liked the way they sat. I 
moved to the back seat area and pulled all the &quot;extra&quot; parts out. I 
noticed the back seat was covered in a 70's muscle car looking seat 
cover. So I yanked it out and put it up front. I hopped in and it was 
a much better sit. My knees didn't knock the steering column getting 
in too much and it felt much better. Looked good too. The seat cover 
fits the style of the truck.

So I forced the front seat into the back. I sat on it and bounced to 
get the back to get down in it's place. The back seat area has so 
much room and this seat worked much better back there.

I yanked a razor out and scraped on the back window and 2 rear side 
windows. I got 'em all clean and they look great. Still need to do 
the cab ones.

I THINK I'm gonna hold off on the front ones though. I've got an idea 
for home-made safari windows. They may turn out a little rough, but I 
think for the most part they're gonna be just the ticket. Cheap and 
functional.

I don't think I'll get much more work in this weekend. I've got to 
tend to other stuff around the house and it'll give me a little break 
since I'm waiting on cables and tires.

Still some work to do but I feel like I'm close enough not to sweat 
it too much. Feels good to have a driving bus.
