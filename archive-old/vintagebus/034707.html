Hi Tom,
Sounds like a classic case of needs all of the connections cleaned.  When 
colder than normal weather comes along the metal of the connections itself 
shrinks slightly and a bad connection just get to be worse.  For the most 
part the Bosch HSR is just a bandaid, unless the wire from the ignition 
switch to the starter solinoid is proven to be damaged in some way to not 
allow the amperage (IE burnt wire.) needed through it.
   So start from the battery and take all the connections apart, sand those 
large bolt together connections clean, and before bolting back together 
slather on some petroleum jelly on them to help prevent corrosion for quite 
sometime.  If you have battery cables with those repair battery clamps that 
clamp onto the end of the old battery cables get new cables/clamps that are 
swedged together, or new brass battery clamps soldered to the ends of the old 
cables.
  Proceed forward and continue cleaning all the other connections.  Just 
pulling each slip on connection and putting it back together helps knock off 
the corrosion.  Plus if any of these are loose just squeez the female 
connector slightly more closed while they are apart.  Then feel how much 
better/snugger they fit when you slip them together.  Do not forget to clean 
the ground strap from the body to the tranny nose cone or the spots that the 
headlights ground to the body.    Eric&amp;Barb
