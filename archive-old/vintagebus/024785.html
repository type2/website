Harry,

I have done 4 VW's with WW's (sold thru WCM) product.  They are very good
quality units.  Tip's i have are:

Take GREAT notes befor you take the old one out.  His schematics are all
right, but can get confusing when you have a bundle of wires going nowhere.
Take a video if you can

Make sure you run a cable thru the body when you pull the old unit.  Keep it
small in diameter.

Clean all your connections befor you start connecting things.

Probably the hardest parts besides contorting your body under the dash is
getting the wire thru the engine compartment for the tail light and license
light.  Also running the wire for the dimmer switch if it is on the floor.
Make sure you leave your dome light wires in place as the kit does not come
with them

Otherwise, it is a good kit.  should take at least a day to do.

Matthew

&gt; No complaints beside the delay, which I knew going in.  They did a
&gt; beautiful job in between their insurance meat &amp; potatoes. The work was
&gt; extensive, new rockers, floors, replaced the nose with a '67 clip, and
&gt; retained the '63 dash. It's a bright RAL2000, orange/yellow.
&gt;
&gt; Question #1;  The harness pulled out and back had breaks and repairs
&gt; from an old nose crunch, so I'm replacing it with a WiringWorks harness.
&gt; Has anyone here done a full wiring replacement and are willing to send
&gt; me some tips &amp; tricks?
&gt;
&gt; I know that the fuel sender is a little longer, and I'm ready to splice
&gt; that in. Bob at WW says my alternator isn't a problem either. A good
&gt; fish-tape is hanging in my garage, Bently at hand, I've got a good
&gt; crawler and a dry driveway. What's next?
