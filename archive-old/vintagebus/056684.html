&gt; I couldn't find a part no. for it, can I get just this or do I need to get a

Hi Charles,
No availible replacement part, unless you find a ruined tail light buld 
holder with good pieces.  You might want to look into mounting two bulb 
sockets from other makes of junkyarded autos into your ruined bulbholder to 
increase turn signal brightness.
