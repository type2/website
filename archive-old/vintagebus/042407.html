hi all,

just wanted to say that i bought 2 mirrors an arm and a clamp from ronnie
at type2parts_dot_com last week and i couldnt be happier.

At the time my order was taken he chatted with me for 20 minutes about my
plan to take my bus to alaska next year, gave me some good advice on
spares to take, and took my order.  That order arrived promptly and was
packed extremely well with environmentally friendly biodegradeable peanuts
:)

What i bought was a couple of round mirrors and some clamps and an arm.

The round mirrors are the aluminum ones he has and look way cool... i like
them a lot! the clamp looks good, and the arm is great too. It has a
different thread than teh original one i have, and doesnt come with the
little lock plate for under the nut, but that is small stuff... and he has
both passenger and drivers side mirror arms, though i had a passenger side
one and didnt order that.

just wanted to express my satisfaction publically, i have no connection to
type2parts_dot_com.  I am just a customer.

peas,

Steve
