Subject: 1/3-2/3 and rear seat
Message-ID: &lt;Pine.GSO.4.10.10002180736240.21683-100000_at_cks.ssd.k12.wa_dot_us&gt;

I have a set of pictures of a middle seat...the 1/3 fold down type with
the grab bars at the back rest tops...and also the matching rear seat too
that has the kick panel that runs across the front of the metal support
bars and has the stamped aluminum trim that attatches to it.  
If you go to the link there are some other things there besides the seats
but if you click on &quot;Steves Seats&quot;  you'll see them well enough.
if interested in getting them and making an offer go to
