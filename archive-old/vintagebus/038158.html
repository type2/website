Hi Steve,    In a message dated 98-12-10 00:12:25 EST, you write:

&lt;&lt; The rack you want is a 1/3 Westfalia rack.  It goes behind the poptop.&gt;&gt;
We are guessing that he means the aluminuim, steel, and wood westie rack.
There are two different lengths for the 1960s split screens.  53&quot; long for the
flip hatch westies and the 47&quot; long model for the pop-top westies.
 
 &lt;&lt;BTW you will also need two sections of alum. channel that is screwed or
 pop-rivited to the drip rail.  &gt;&gt;
Is this for the tent?  If so this is for a Riveria model of camper conversion
done in the USA not westie at all.       Eric &amp; Barb
