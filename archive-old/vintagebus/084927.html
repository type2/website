Subject: Non-T2/VW help needed in Watertown, NY

Anyone close by Watertown, NY? Happen to have a pair of crutches in the
attic/garage?

My wife, Lisa, who's been at Ft. Drum since mid-May for birth of grandson
(sigh.. #11), managed to badly sprain her ankle yesterday and needs to borrow
a pair to give her a bit of mobility until we get her back here to Oregon for
the 'real' Dr. visit next Saturday.

Distance searching only finds &quot;Help, I've fallen and can't get up.&quot; type
companies and the local sources such as Goodwill/Salvation Army don't seem to
have the two hundred pairs or so pairs that the charities here have.

If you're in the area, and if you have a pair cluttering up your
attic/garage/storage, we could sure use them.  It just seems silly to to give
a large corporation $ for something that I already own like half a dozen pairs
of.

I'll gladly send them back to you or send you a similar sized aluminum pair
now or I can pass them on to the next person in need.

She's 5'4&quot; so a shorter pair would be needed.

Please reply p-mail if you're in that area and either can help or can point me
in a better direction.

Thanks,
