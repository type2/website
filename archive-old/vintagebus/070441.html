Subject: Re: [VB] Yokohama quote

&gt;&gt;This is over half what I paid for the bus

i hear ya! i had to do the same thing a little over a year ago, but i have 
never regretted it. i have gotten many, many trouble free and smooth 
riding miles from the new set of tires i purchased, and i didn't buy the 
highest quality tires available to me at the time. the quote you got 
sounds fair, they sound like nice quality tires. IMHO: you'll not be 
disappointed.

good luck,
- matthew
