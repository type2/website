Subject: Re: [VB] stuck drums...

The stars move easily and I can definately unadjust them so the shoes aren't touching the drum.  I don't think they are stuck to the drum as I can drive the bus and it has oomph, doesn't pull (unles I brake)   I don't care if I mangle the shoes, or the brake stick between the shoes, or the stars, or the drum, (I have spares), as long as I can get the drum OFF the bus. 

  I hesitate to heat it real hot as I wonder what that'll do to the temper of the stub axle, and the plastic (if any, some do have it) in the RGBearings.  

Ah, the rain here really gets things rusted stuck, unlike in the desert. 
 Olympia... It's The Water.   when the forcast says 80% chance of rain, that means at any one time there's a 80% chance, not that that's the chance for the whole day.   So basically it'll rain 80% of the day.  In fact it's raining now, and I'm going to go try to clear some space in the garage.  

But I want the less labour intensive method.   I just don't feel like banging on it for an hour or three with the BFH or a 8lb sledge.  Maybe if I get really pissed off about something I'll do that as a socially acceptible way of taking it out.  Really I just want it to slide off easily.  ha ha hah. 
Thanks for all the suggestions.  It's great.
