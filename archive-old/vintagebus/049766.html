Subject: Re: [VB] Types of Busses

&gt;Here is a serious Ignorant New Guy question(s).  I just purchased a 67
&gt;westy.  I have a reference book with data like, paint codes, production
&gt;figures, etc.  The problem is this book doesn't say &quot;westy&quot;.  It lists the
&gt;following models:
&gt;Panelvan
&gt;Mirobus
&gt;Samba
&gt;Kombi
&gt;Pick-up
&gt;Ambulance
&gt;Others
&gt;Which one of these is mine?  What is the difference in these?
&gt;Thanks!
&gt;Mike


A Westy is made from a Kombi, which is a windowed panel van.
