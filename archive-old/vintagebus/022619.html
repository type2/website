I used the two-part on my '55, but I didn't wait a month for the sanding
and buffing.  Prolly should have, but I had a show to get it to!

&gt;Use a single stage acrylic enamel.  Don't bother with a good two part

&gt;this time.  You'll save at least $100.00 bucks a gallon.  Be aware, that this

&gt;month or so if you plan on sanding and buffing.
