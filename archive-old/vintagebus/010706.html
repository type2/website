Subject: Re: [VB] front window seal ?
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

Is there any problems with the auto glass silicone causing rust?
In my 57, the old man siliconed all the windows shut.
Saved the interior but my popout frames are toast.
I would be worried about this stuff they inject rusting out the channel under 
the window frames.

&lt;&lt;hey all,
the auto glass shop is a great idea... never thought of it. where exactly is 
the water coming into the bus? between the glass to rubber area or the seal 
to frame area? and for the people that have gone to the glass shops do they 
seal both of these areas?
thanks,
