Subject: Re: Feet &amp; Parts wanted

So what's the big deal?  I had a foot gas pedal up until I had to pull
the mat  to work on the floor.  Pedal's just a tad big to fit through
the hole in the mat.  It was cool and was almost a poor man's cruise
control in that it weighed enough to match the return spring on the
carb.  It was kinda like riding my 64 BMW in that the throttle stays
wherever I put it.  Besides, it's MY bus and I'll put whatever kinda
pedal I damn well want.
