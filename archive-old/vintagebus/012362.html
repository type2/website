Subject: BBB III tenting, and rex
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

a far as tent camping at BBB III goes you have your choice of next to the water, on a bluff overlooking the water, sharing a bus campsite with a friend, or you are more then welcome to use one of my buses i should have 5 of them there to choose from, not counting all the others that will be there, so there should be no problem for those coming with there tents.

  rex thanks for the gIfT sEE yoU iN JAnuAry
