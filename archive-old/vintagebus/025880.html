Gene and list, 

Thanks for the reply.  

&gt; I used the Dupont
&gt;  Prime-n-Seal, and .... You MUST wear supplied air while
&gt;  using it, it seems to be concentrated evil.  
Interesting.  The MSDS sheet on Prime-N-Seal indicates only an organic vapor 
respirator, but I only have a fresh air respirator, so I would use that 
anyway.  The weird thing is that POR-15 Tie-coat primer is an isocyanate 
urethane.  It was my understanding that all isocyanate paints should be used 
only with a fresh air respirator while mixing and spraying.  They are one of 
the most dangerous types of auto paints.  Risks associated with breathing 
isocyanate spray include pulmonary edema and other PERMANENT lung injury with 
death possibly resulting due to lungs ceasing to function.  However, the FAQ 
on the tie-coat (http://www.por15_dot_com/faqs/faqtieco.html) states: &quot;As with 
all solvent-based coatings, use an organic vapor particulate respirator, 
NIOSH/MSHA approved, when spraying or brushing. In closed areas, use an 
air-supplied respirator when spraying.&quot;  This makes me think that the 
Tie-coat does not have isocyanate in very high concentration, otherwise, I am 
not sure how they get around recommending a fresh air respirator in all 
applications.  I am going to ask for a MSDS from resto-motive to follow up.  
In any case, I agree with Gene, that these paints are all nasty as hell, but 
I am prepared for that.  I usually spray and then leave the shop (in a 
separate building without residential occupancy) for 12 hours.

&gt;  Also, you have to spray your
&gt;  topcoat within 12 hours of spraying the [Prime-N-Seal] primer/sealer, else 
you've got to
&gt;  scuff it before topcoating.  
Now that is a drawback.  I thought the whole point of &quot;non-sanding&quot; primer 
was that you didn't have to sand it efore topcoating.

&gt;  I am a sucker for good advertizing, and if the Tie-Coat/POR-15 combination
&gt;  is as tough as they say it is, (or even half), then I would go with
&gt;  that...
I am deep into the POR-15 propaganda also.  The only thing that makes me wary 
is that it is all single component.  My gut tells me that 2 or 3 component 
paint is always better.  Anyway, I used a lot of the POR-15

&gt;  Speaking of rust, anyone got an opinion on whether to use &quot;One Step&quot; or 
Rust
&gt;  Mort in rockers, doglegs, gates, etc. to kill and prevent more rust?  I'm
&gt;  gonna get one of those wands to squirt the stuff in with....&quot;One Step&quot; is
&gt;  about $100/gallon.....
I do have an opinion on the One-Step.  The directions says it &quot;converts&quot; rust 
to a black inert primer.  This stuff is 85-95% solvent and propellant in the 
spray can (although by the gallon there is probably no propellant).  It 
flashes within minutes of being applied.  As far as I can tell, this means it 
does not have a chance to penetrate into the rust.  It may convert the rust, 
but unless you have rust that is only a few molecules of ferric oxide thick, 
it will not do anything to the rust underneath.  Don't take my word for it; 
test it yourself.  Get some rusted steel.  Spray it on.  Let it &quot;cure&quot;.  
Scrape it off.  Before you get down to the unoxidized steel, I am willing to 
bet you will find a nice layer of rust just below the one-step.  In my 
opinion, it is crap.

In concealed areas like you are talking about, why not use a product like 
POR-15 which at least has a chance of sealing the rust?  I sprayed the inside 
of the pillars and channels on my project with an undercoating wand like you 
are talking about with POR-15.  I did this after spraying the concealed areas 
with a 30% solution of phosphoric acid with some zinc thrown in for good 
measure and to act as a sacrificial anode.  I also used a stove pipe cleaning 
brush (for 2 inch stove pipe) on a long fiberglass rod after the acid.  I 
then compressed air to blow out any loose particles.  At least POR-15 doesn't 
say it is going to &quot;convert&quot; the rust.  It really pisses me off when the 
propaganda turns out to be BS.  POR-15 may be BS, and we all may be cursing 
resto-motive in 10 years, but we are happy now.
