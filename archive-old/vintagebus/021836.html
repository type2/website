Dave or anyone else,

Is this true for a Dcab too? The tank in my '60 has a crack at the filler
neck so I don't even get to use the full capacity anyway. I think my tank
takes about 35 litres(we don't do gallons down here.) 150% of that would
make my visits to the filling station very infrequent and mean no more jerry
can on longer trips.

TIA 


Michael
