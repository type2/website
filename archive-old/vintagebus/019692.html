Hey!

I'm sorry, I guess I wasn't real clear... actually, my buddy is/was? considering putting a low
geared beetle tranny in his 65 bus, not a bug.  The way I put it across though, it could have been
read either way, I guess.  Again, SORRY!!

Thanks for all the describing, though!!

&gt;  =========================
&gt; remove engine from bus (if applies)
&gt; ditto bug
&gt; remove transaxle from bus (drain trans oil first)
&gt; ditto bug.
&gt; remove axles and tubes from bug trans.    ditto bus
&gt; 
&gt; remove side covers (outer ring of 13mm bolts hold them in) from bus trans 
&gt; (the one you are going to put in bug)  swap them side to side.  This way you 
&gt; will have 4 gears forward and 1 reverse .
&gt; 
&gt; put bug axle shafts onto the trans going into bug.  use best crown gears, 
&gt; measure play with fulcrums all that stuff (its in your bentley)
&gt; 
&gt; install axletube, check slide of tube, use as many paper shims as needed 
&gt; (usually 3, can be 1 to 5) .  make sure you install the axle tube on the 
&gt; correct sides.  gett to spacing right, then take it apart and seal between 
&gt; each shim.  (...)
