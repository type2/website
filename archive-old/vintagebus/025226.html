I bought &quot;the&quot; radio/cassette player from Ronnie of Old Volks Home. It's
really great installed in my '61 Westy. My only wheels with a radio
(whee). Tunes... Jimmy Buffet, ahh. Some static, however. Ronnie says I
need bosch 09001 plugs. Are these available from FLAPS or must I go to a
VW source?
