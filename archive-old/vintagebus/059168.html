&gt;Of course you can use the &quot;Shop Anywhere&quot; feature on the PayPal website 
&gt;and use your PayPal balance to buy stuff from ANY online supplier.  [...] 
&gt;They give you a &quot;virtual&quot; credit card number that deducts from your 
&gt;Paypal account.  That way, there is no risk of fraud with your personal 
&gt;cards

...and if somebody does rip you off, you have no recourse whatsoever!
All those nice federal laws about disputing credit-card charges don't
apply to PayPal.  Read their fine print - they are just a payment escrow
service.  You can complain to PayPal but it may not do any good.

This shouldn't be a problem when dealing with reputable suppliers, but
most reputable suppliers should have a secure online credit card form
anyway.

All IMHO.
