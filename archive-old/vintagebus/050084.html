Subject: Ebay posts

&gt;Personally, I like Kaybayo's daily ebay post.  It keeps me from searching
&gt;through the 14+ pages on ebay everyday.  On the days or times i dont care
&gt;about ebay, its pretty easy to just delete something.  Its not like these
&gt;posts dont come with subject lines. Ever try using the mail sorting
&gt;functions on your mail client?  Just have it delete the OT or ebay words in
&gt;the subject line.  These complaints are pretty trivial.  Try working in the
&gt;IT field where your on multiple lists that have upwards of 500 posts daily.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Kabayo, Congrats on the MR2 and thanks for the daily ebay scoop.

Thanks Emmet!

You know, all of this bitching about my *TWO* posts regarding my auction is
cluttering up the list many times more than my *TWO* posts did.

Bus relevance of my MR2 auction:

I have mentioned more than once in my posts that I needed to make space in
my garage to start working on my bus.  I've gotten rid of 4 refrigerators,
three ranges, and now the MR2.  I finally have S P A C E !!  Only problem
is, now I don't have the time (code orders on my rental property are
keeping me and my wife going 7 days a week right now).

As for my daily Ebay updates, I have received far more private thank yous
than I have public and private complaints.  And most importantly, I have
Thom's approval (so far) for my updates, which will resume when I have time
to search Ebay again.
