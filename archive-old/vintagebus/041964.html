There is no such thing as grade 10 oil.  there is 10W oil.  You're just as
well to use 10W-40 for this, as the engine barely gets warmed up.

&gt; then add some straight 30 weight; it gets tossed at 100. next batch of 30
&gt; goes for 250.

Why the insistence upon grade 30 oil?  Do you have a specific reason?
