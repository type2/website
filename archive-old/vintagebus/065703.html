Subject: Re: [VB] Doghouse Fan Shroud w/extra 'ring'

A gentelman in my area installed one of these shrouds on his
Thing(Jake Raby built,Miller injected 2L Type 1).He saw a
drastic reduction in his head temps,do not have exact
numbers but this guy has fully instrumented his engine.

Same concept as the old Vornado fans.




 Hi Ray,
 Pretty sure those were used on FI late 70s beetles.  We
 have collected about  five of these fan shrouds so far for
 our future engines after we convert them  for center carb
 control cables.  Since the USA emission standards of the
 late  1970s was getting harder and harder to meet for the
 VWAC engine and this in  turn was making these engines run
 hotter and hotter this ring seemed to be a  try at
 increasing air flow into the shroud.  From what we have
 heard this  ring increases air flow by reducing turbulance
 at the fan shroud opening.   Much like the leading edge
 wing slats on those Australian crop dusters (As  seen in
 the last &quot;Road Warrior&quot; movie.) that increases flow over
 the top of  the wing for better lift at really low MPH air
 speed.   Eric&amp;Barb
