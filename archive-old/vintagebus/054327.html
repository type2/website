An easy technique for loosening and tightening the pulley nut, is to use a
medium size screwdriver and an 18&quot; breaker bar with your socket on the
end. There is a screw head sticking out of the rear of the generator body
(rear is rear) at about the 12 o'clock position. There is a notch about
half inch long in the perifery of the inside (or, front) half of the
pulley. Wedge the screwdriver thru the notch when you spin the pulley
around so the notch is up top near the screw head, so it locks up with the
screw head, thru the notch. When you are loosening the nut, you'll have
the notch to the right, at about 1 o'clock, with the screwdriver sticking
fairly vertical.
Hold and push the screwdriver with one hand, and turn the breaker bar
with the other hand, to loosen the nut. To tighten, you'll position the
notch and screwdriver to the left of the screw head, and reverse the
procedure. When you get the nut as tight as you can using this method,
it's about as tight as it needs to be. Check your Bentley manual or VeeWee
for exact torque, but good and tight, leaning with these tools has always
worked for me.
