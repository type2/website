Subject: Re: [VB] Busses and Harbor Freight

To all newbies on the list,

what Curt is referring to, is that I ranted once many years ago, about
how Harbor Freight was just a chinese importing company masquerading as a
US hardware store chain. I'm also known as the POR-15 guy, being that I
was the first on the list to begin posting about it, back in 96 or so.

Anyway, old list history. Bus content:

All newbies, and all others - prevent engine fires: slip a slit 2&quot; piece
of VW fuelline over your metal fuel line where it goes thru the front tin
piece. Check that metal line first for the groove cut into it by that tin
piece before doing so. Replace if grooved or cut at all! Number one cause
of engine fires!
