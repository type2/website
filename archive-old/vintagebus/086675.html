Subject: Re: [VB] Engine full of gas

Hi Acapps99,
If it is doing that, while the engine is stopped it could be  your needle 
valve is bad.  Could be your float is too heavy, or  cracked and full of fuel.  
Later carbs have a plastic clip that must be  installed above the float 
properly or causes problems.
