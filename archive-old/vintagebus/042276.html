&gt; Question?
&gt; 
&gt; While returning from central Oregon last week, (100 + temps) the oil light 
&gt; began to glow, this is a 1776, single carb 34pict, has 10 thou balanced with 
&gt; a CW.
&gt; 
&gt; I pulled over &amp; shut off the engine, I checked the oil sensor wire &amp; wiggled 
&gt; it some, the spade connector moved slightly, anyway started it back up &amp; 
&gt; heard nothing except a smooth sounding 1776, the light stayed off, I didn't 
&gt; mention it but when I spritz water on the pulley &amp; case sizzle...sizzle, way 
&gt; to hot. Timing is correct, no obstructions in the fan.
&gt; 
&gt; I let things cool about 20 min &amp; took off, Hears the Question If you open the 
&gt; heater box's (heat on) will this help to run cooler?

No!  The heater robs air from the fan shroud which otherwise would be
available for cooling the oil and cylinders.  This is no problem when the
heater is needed, but in the summer might be the straw that breaks the
camel's back.

In a water-cooled car, running the heater to prevent overheating is valid,
as the heater is simply a little radiator that will remvoe heat from the
coolent.
