  Thom is correct, you can polish acrylic - Notice I 
say &quot;acrylic&quot; and not &quot;Plexiglass&quot; which is a brand name 
of acrylic that is made by AtoHaas. AtoHaas pioneered 
acrylic and supplied it to the Luftwaffe during WWII for 
turret domes, etc. If the acrylic corner windows aren't 
AtoHaas material, calling them plexiglass is like going 
to Burger King and ordering a Big Mac- But I digress.
  The place I work sells a scratch remove called &quot;210 
plus&quot;, $5.95 for 7.5 oz. this will remove small 
scratches, but if you you run a finger nail over it and 
it catches, it's too deep to remove with the stuff. You 
can buff out deeper scratches, but it will introduce 
distortion. You cannot repair it if it is &quot;crazed&quot;.
  Never use Windex or any kind of alcohol or solvent 
based cleaner, it will cause it to haze or craze!! Only 
use mild soap and water, we also sell &quot;Brillianize&quot; a 
cleaner made specifically for acrylics and 
polycarbonates.
  If you want brand new ones they could be draped formed 
using cast acrylic sheet. Injection molding would be 
better, but tooling costs could be as much as $20,000.
  BTW- that '53 was sweet, there was a 54? samba for 
sale also with original interior. I also liked the 
Doubledoor Barndoor with the divider in front of the 
package tray!

Have just been browsing the great photos from Kelley

Everett's site:

It shows the Plexiglass corner windows in a restored '53 
deluxe (which 
looks lovely!) Those corner windows look mint - are they 
brand new?? 
The ones I've seen always seem to have alot of surface 
stress crazing 
and lines on them after nearly 50 years of life, and the 
optical 
properties suffer due to this. Has anyone tried to 
polish Plexiglass 
corner windows to remove this (perspex polish is 
available).......and 
does it work? 

Thanks for any insight.
