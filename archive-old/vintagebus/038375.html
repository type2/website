Subject: 1959 crew cab, in junk yard for 10+ years... help!
Date: Tue, 11 Aug 1998 18:38:41 -0700
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

Ok,  I'm sure the whole Internet knows I'm looking for a crew cab.  Hope I
haven't upset too many with this topic...

I already know I'm in over my head on this one!  Given I helped Rex Eastman
locate his new '61 23-window in Seattle... and Ken asked anyone who had a
solid bodied Crew Cab sitting around...

Seems Rex does.  One he has had around for 10 years without doors and other
stuff.  He has a '59 that sat in a junk yard for something like 15 years --
he got it and it hasn't been on the road for decades.  As my threads have
implied... I don't know a lot about these (never owned a split) and I am
wanting to avoid body work.  Body work seems to be Rex's strength (among
others).  So we may have a deal.  The other plus is that Rex is coming
within 10 minutes of my house in 12 days to get his 23-window!  So he can
deliver it here for free....

The problem?  I've never seen it, it hasn't been driven for many many years,
and I just don't know what I'm getting into.  A lot of parts could be
missing or in very unknown condition.  For this to work for me, I need to
generate a LOT of details.  So I've started a list of questions to ask Rex
about condition and so forth.

Any help with this list is appreciated.  Especially on the small bits and
unique year to year parts... can you help me determine that I get a fully
assembled 1959?  Any things I should pay close attention to for something
that hasn't been DRIVEN for more than 10 years?

Anyone near Rex willing to go over it to get another set of eyes on it?

Rex is working to get me the VIN and m-codes so I have more info to work
with... but we don't have a lot of time, so any help getting my list
together is appreciated.  May also be searching for some parts!
