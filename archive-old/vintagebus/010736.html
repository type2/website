Hi Garret,
The advance should be no higher than 30 degrees BTDC and go no farther at 
high RPMs unless you are drag racing and doing alot of exotic things to your 
engine.  28-30 BTDC seems to be a good farthest advance and at least 20 
degrees BTDC at 2,500 RPM.  Your engine temp of 200F is well within the 
160-220 we keep our engine between.  During the winter up here in the PNW we 
run 160-180F for 6 to 8 months of the year and with a thermostatic bellows 
and flaps have had no problems with water vapor in the oil.  Not so when we 
used to run without a thermostatic bellows and flaps systems and oil temps 
stayed down about 140F.  We even used to have sump strainers showing pitting 
due to acidification due to water and raw fuel getting past the rings and 
into the oil from running too cold!
