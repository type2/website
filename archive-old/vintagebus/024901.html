&gt; Hey folks from Southern California.  Does anyone know the story of the
&gt; nice 55-58? single cab sitting up on a lift right off the 5 fwy in Buena
&gt; Park (right around Beach Blvd., No. side of the fwy).  It is painted a
&gt; non stock two tone silver and is at a Chevy dealer.
&gt;
&gt; This SC looks very complete w/hoops and a banner for the dealer on the
&gt; hoops.  Its been up there for the last 6 months rain or shine.  Anyone
&gt; know the story?  I stopped and asked and they said its NFS.
&gt;

I about twisted my neck off last friday when I drove by that.  I put a
mental note to go by and find out what's up, but you just saved me a trip.
Didn't they know who owns it since they knew it wasn't for sale?
