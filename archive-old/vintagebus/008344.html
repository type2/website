&gt;&lt;&lt; In the meantime, I was wondering how rare a Double Door Kombi is?
&gt; I've only seen 1 other one but I have seen a few Double Door Deluxes. &gt;&gt;
&gt;
Well, they are uncommon, but definitely not rare, People today tend to take
the &quot;rare&quot; status a little too far... You know whats rare? I would think
that Gary Laverre's
lunch bus would qualify for rare.
&gt;
Thanks for the feedback, just to be clear (to others), I was talking about a
Kombi with 7 doors - double cargo doors on both sides of the vehicle.

I would agree that the lunch Bus is rare but I've seen more Weenie Wagons
than Double Door Kombis...
