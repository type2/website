I have two used popout frames (No glass) in great shape.
Solid/Rust free, seperated, drilled and tapped, originals.
Need a sandblast, prep and paint.
P-mail if there is any interest.
They are 40$ each and do NOT include shipping.
I also have a few used late (60-67) popout window glass as well.
Regards, Greg

&lt;&lt;Yes.  They suck.  Actually, they'd have to imprve to suck.

The corner radiusing was not correct, nor was it consistent from
one corner to the next.  I honestly don't see how you could get glass in
it and not break it.
