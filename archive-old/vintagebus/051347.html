Subject: RE: [VB] Brake Questions?!?

Charles,

You could swap LATER spindles on the early beam, and use your later brake
stuff(Backing plates, Drums, etc.).  I did this on my 63, to save money on
brake cylinders.

&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Ok, I am hopefully getting a '58 panel (maybe even a '59, who knows).  I
&gt; have everything to do the brakes on a 1964 but now have no use for all of
&gt; those parts.  I was wondering, will the backing plates, and drums
&gt; bolt on to
&gt; the earlier spindles?  I know that the whole front suspension is different
&gt; on the 64-67 years, but this would save me a bundle of money since I have
&gt; all new drums, wheel cylinders, bearings, etc... for this '64 but not the
&gt; 58.  I don't want to change the whole beam, and wanted to know what my
&gt; options are.
&gt;
&gt; Thanks
&gt; Charles
