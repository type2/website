Hello

I energized my new wiring last night.  Everything worked except the left 
blinker.  They all(frt.,back,.dashlight) would work for 3-4 flashes.  Then 
the only one that would work was the front one.

I know that this a probably a lazy question , but where do you think that i 
should start?  I do not think that it is grounds because I cleaned all 
terminals with terminal cleaner and then coated them with copper anti-seize. 
  I have a nos 559 flasher so I do not think that it is that either.

thanks
domonic
