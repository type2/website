Subject: Re: [VB] Lifespan of a full flowed type 1 in a bus

I had to rebuild an engine at 60,000 miles because I put off the valve 
job that I knew I needed to do before that and I dropped a valve. The 
engine had a full flow filter, I was using Castrol Syntec at the time 
and doing oil changes every 10,000 miles. You read that right. I don't 
use Castrol any more, but I still go 10K on a change with Royal Purple 
oil. I have never seen rod bearings come out of a VW engine that looked 
as good as those. I put them back on the crank with plastiguage to get 
the real story and they checked good to the *new* bearing specs. I don't 
see why a VW bottom end wouldn't go at least 100K miles with a full flow 
filter. Just be sure to do a valve job at about 40K miles. I have a 
little over 80K on another full flow engine and it still runs just fine.

&gt;In theory installing oil full flow filtrationi in a bus doubles the engine

&gt;
&gt;In practice it also adds trouble like risks to loose oil in the hoses or
&gt;fail to prime the thing properly after an oil change and run dry.
&gt;
&gt;So I wonder : How many miles did you get out of your full flowed type 1
&gt;engine in a bus ?
