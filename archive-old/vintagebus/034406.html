Tis a good point.  I drill this hole a tad larger
for this very reason....

I have one spare set of early NOS german link pins and bearings that I'd
sell
for less than $79.95 each (yowza!  - gotta be early pins at this
price?).  Still be a lot cheaper for you US folks even after freight.

I've offered David first pass at them....

&gt; Hi David,
&gt; Good job!  Make sure that the outlet openings in the caps that go over the
&gt; 
&gt; large ends of the link pins are open and not clogged.  Most old buses we
&gt; have 
&gt; gotten have had this problem and this does not allow the old grease to
&gt; exit 
&gt; both ends and builds up both dirt and water until it destroyes that end of
&gt; 
&gt; the link pin.   Eric&amp;Barb
