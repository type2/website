Subject: Re: [VB] split-bay conversions

Thom used to have some photos of the process on vintagebus_dot_com. I had a 71
tank installed into my 64 DD delivery. I had them use the 71 filler spout. A
little tight but it goes in with a little push. I think the floor around the
outlet has to be pushed down a little. I used some POR 15 gas tank sealer.
Not sure if gas will go into the hump on top. I sealed off the fume vent
that comes out of the top of the hump. I guess I could figure out the
charcoal canister stuff if I wanted to. Since I got my bus back from ISP
West, I have not tried to fill the tank to the top.
