Hey Jim,
Well I ran a VDO gauge.  Now I won't say how well calibrated it was, but
with the decklid closed the gauge went at least 20 degrees hotter.  I used
to commute between Denver and Albuquerque every other week.  (72 std.
beetle, 1600 dual port)  In the summer it gets  hot, high altitude, dry air.
You try everything you can.
I tried the decklid standoffs.  No change at all.  I tried roping the
decklid open so it was maybe open 6&quot; on the bottom.  This worked for me.
Don't know the exact temps as it wasn't NBS certified calibrated, but if
it gets 20 degrees cooler, I'm going to go with it.  This was using a
dipstick sender.  I compared the VDO setup with sticking a thermocouple
gauge that I used to check the calibration of instruments with and they
were within 5 degrees at 200F, so figure 5 degree error.
I figure the gauge isn't so far out of calibration that it goes the wrong
direction.  Up is up and down is down.:)
I haven't tried the same on a T2, but maybe somebody should.  I know
external oil coolers help.
John
