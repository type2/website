Subject: re:door resto

was asked
&quot; Also, should I use any kind of insulation or quieting material? &quot;

i used this sound damping material from mcmaster carr. it is sticky back,
cuts relatively easily. actually i think it is called acoustical damping
sheets, the viscoelastic works pretty well. it seems impervious to water(the
inside of the doors always get wet when it rains, part of the design). the
doors sound really solid when i shut them now.

i also used por-15 all the spots on the bottom of the doors that were rusty.

this was only the front doors. the other doors i haven't done anything to
yet.
