Thom et. al.,

I was in oregon about a month ago, and saw a similar rice-burner honda 
accord with the same 17 yr. old type punk-ass kid behind the wheel with hat 
on backwards.  Vanity plates read: 2HOT4U.  Seems to me like that's more of 
a feminine than masculine message to put on your plates, but that's only the 
beginning of all the &quot;why?&quot; questions I have for tricked out civics and 
accords.

'64 SO-35
'96 Honda Accord, bone stock, thank you.

&gt;The *funny* part was it was on a rice-boy-in-progress &quot;street weapon&quot;
&gt;driven by some punk ass kid who couldn't have been more than 17.  Maybe
&gt;it was his mom's car...
