&gt; I argued that it  just had to do with the keeping an accurate temp for the 
&gt; thermostat (which i have never ran either!=) and a guard for the puhsrod

Hi Wade,
They also help to protect the cylinders and thermostat from the water that 
splashes up from the rear tires.  Which would close the thermostat when the 
engine is up to temp already.  Plus cause the cylinders to deform temporarly, 
warp and possibly even crack.  
Interestingly the Bismark had an observation plane that would be catapulted 
into the air to search for frieghters to attack and Allied warships to avoid 
or attack.  When this plane returned to the Bismark it landed on the water 
and was craned onto the deck.  This was a big problem due to the cold sea 
water hitting the hot cast iron cylinders of the engine would often crack one 
or more.  During the Bismarks final voyage they ran out of cylinders to 
replace the cracked ones thus blinding the Bismark to long range knowledge to 
where the British war fleet was at.  Just one of many factors in a chain of 
events/mistakes that doomed the Bismark to be sunk by the British fleet.  
This chain of tragic events for Bismark reads like the story of the Titanic 
does.  If just one event/mistake had changed, either one of these ships 
probably would have made it to port.
