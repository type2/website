I am having major back glass problems.

When I posted to the list my need for a back glass I wrote it was for a
1962 15 window deluxe.   .. snip
- - - - - - - 
the 63 and earlier deluxes (small back hatch) have a unique rear glass.   

okay- rear glass-  
-barndoor is the same size/shape as the up to 65 glass in the back of a truck 
(not rectangular)
-post BD 55  through 63 non deuxe have a small rear window that is rectangular
-post BD 55 through 63 deluxes have a rear window that is bigger than the non 
deluxes
-64- 67 have a bigger rear hatch and a bigger rear window to go along with it.
-and the later splitty trucks have a big back glass, but I am not sure if it 
is thesame as a 64-67 not truck or not.

seems you aquired some of the regular 55-63 type and a 64-67 type.

the rear deluxe 55-63 glass is hard to find.    Particularly as the 61-63s 
tended to come with easy to break sigla glass, and earlier buses are harder 
to find.

re spare tire hump cover- what colour is your bus (originally) and what 
colour is thepanel you got with it and the piece you got from someone else?   
My brain suggests the change in pointy to rounded came when they changed the 
depth of the spare wheel well behind the seat, which is the same time they 
went from the full bench seat to the 1/3 2/3 front seat.

I suggest  concentrate first on what you need to get the buses running and 
drivable (this definately include glass so you dont get exhaust in the rear 
window) and then worry about interior trim.
