you guys are amazing....the response time is faster than my bus going down a
really steep hil with a tailwind.
i have gotten a few replies suggesting NAPA, and STA-Lube. I think I went
looking for this last year, up in boston. The STA lube stuff was GL-4 and GL-5
rated, I thought this was supposed to be bad, and I had to use stuff that was
solely gl-4 rated?

anyone have experience or suggestions of synthetic vs non synthetic on the
tranny fluid(not motor oil, I have heard those discussions back and forth
before)
