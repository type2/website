Subject: Tires, it had to be tires!

Listees,

I'm in south florida and I need tires. Does anyone know a dealer in this
area who has the Yokohamas or any other recommended tires for our beloved
but finicky buses?  I prefer to go to a place and have it done, rather
than mail/online order, as I don't have any facilities here to balance,
air up, mount tires.

Thanks!

cal
