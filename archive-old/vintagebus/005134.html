Well, I finally got a day or two off now that COMDEX is open ( I set up
exhibits) and got a chance to really dig into the van.  I did a re-build on
the 30/31PICT that wouldn't idle along with the 34PICT-3 and also replaced
plug wires and the coil.  SUCCESS I now have a nice 850-900 RPM idle.  Don't
know what the main cause was as I did all the changes at the same time.
    Thanks for all the suggestions all of you sent while I was screwing with
it and pulling my hair out.

Jon
