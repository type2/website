Subject: RE: [VB] Re: Attn. all shoppers, black plate special on aisle 63

Rich,
That is correct!  Yellow on black plates are only able to be used if you can prove those plates were og to the vehicle.  62 and back (black on yellow)are easy..all you have to have is set of clear plates.

I wouldn't have been able to use these plates if VanBondo hadn't found the og registration receipts.

&gt; 
&gt;   You don't have to have OG plates or paperwork to get
&gt; YOM plates. Witness my '59 double cab with black on
&gt; yellow plates purchased at a Pomona swap.
&gt;   What you do need is LOTS of Excedrin Migrane,
&gt; tenacity, and patients. Mine took about 6 months and 4
&gt; trips to the local DMV.
