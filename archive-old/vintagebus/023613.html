&gt;I have to second this .     The first time I replaced a generator I did it
&gt;this way- it worked fine.   a few years later I  had to replace a generator
&gt;on another bus, and was repeatedly told it couldn't be done with motor in
&gt;situ, and to pull the motor- took me longer to get him to stopping telling me
&gt;how to do it than it did to actually do it.  &lt;grr&gt;
&gt;
&gt;but...  there may be more than one answer.  There may  well be more than one
&gt;way to do things.  Do it the way that is best for you, and keep your mind
&gt;open.    There is so much to learn from people that I seem to learn the
&gt;wierdest stuff in unexpected places.

I wasn't going to mention this, but...

I have replaced a generator without loosening the fan shroud...

1.  Fan off front shaft.
2.  Pulley off rear shaft.
3.  Loosen two long screws holding generator together, let nuts holding
backing (fronting?) plate fall off front end.
4.  Looosen generator clamp.
5.  Slide generator out without dropping shims.

Reverse to replace, except you can't put the nuts back on.

I have done this, but:  it was in the rain, on the side of I-85, and I
fixed it right, by pulling the motor, when I got home.  Any person who
leaves it this way is a lazy slacker and deserves whatever catastophe
befalls them when the generator slips and chews up the fan and
housing...but that's my opinion.

hm- I did it differently - taking the fan and backing/fronting pate out w/
generator.

remove fan belt.
remove wires to generator
loosen gen strap and push it forward so it is off the gen stand
undo the screws on each side holding thfan housing to the cylinder tin
undo the 4 10mm nuts holding the fronting plate to the fan housing.   A couple
are tricky,                           and sometimes have to lift the fanhosing
w/gen attached up to get to.
lift the fan housing up, jam thick screwdriver under in ccrucial places, 
wiggle genertot w/ fan out .

Sometime the carb must come off.

if there is a thermostat, is must be unscrewed from underneath

if doghouse, front tin must come off.

If is easiest in a barndoor, but I have done it in a later bus w/doghouse and
themostat.

But a lot of times it's good to pull the motor, if there is other stuff to do.
If the engine compartment is groose, you will be too after doing this gen
replacement.  If that is all that needs to be done, that's how I do it.  For
me it's less work.

however,  at some point in the not too distant future I will pull the engine
out of the truck and...

drain tranny oil
pull right rear brakes apart,
pull r. r. axle off and replace fulcrum plate(s) - chunks in oil and thunks in
back tell me to do this
replace the axle being anal to get everything clean and seal right
replace rear brake hoses   (other r gear box gets drained too)
install brake cables (both sides) (the old ones are breaking, and will soon be
broke cables)
replace rear brake cylinders/shoes if needed, clean in there, grease adjsuting
stars.
adjust, flush, and bleed brakes
new tranny oil   
it has new fuel line and tranny boots

replace oil cooler and main seals (they don't leak yet- but they are probably
fairly old and hardened/worn)  but something leaks- find oil leak-
replace fan housing. - the one on there had the coil screws pulled out and the
triangle bracket cannot be mounted correctly, meaning the air cleaner is wired
in place to the roof of the engine room.
replace intake with a 211 one,  if I have one for a 40 bus, so air cleaner  to
left will line up correctly  with triangle bracket
? switch to doghouse cooler?
install thermostat if it doesn't have one.  
might as well pop the bus muffler on too, and see if I have an nice uncut
apron in blue.

the generator itself seems fine at this time, so I will not replace it.
However, with the engine out, it is easier to replace gen brushes,  so a good
thing to check.

this is in a bus I can happily drive around,  the main things needed are brake
cables and good fulcrum plates, but I want the air cleaner held in right, and
doing this other stuff would make it nicer.   and I want to do it all in one
fell swoop.    If I needed a gen replace I would think the same way- is that
*all * it needs , or other stuff too.   I tend to have a mental list, and
eventually something says, okay, time to do it, and easier to do it with motor
out so pull it.   like, I wouldn't pull the motor just to fill the tranny oil,
but it is much easier that way, so if I pull it and it needs a change,  that's
the time to.
