My Todd H. tranny ( which had quit going into and staying in 3rd gear)  has
arrived at Transaxle Engineering and Jeff Fields reported his findings. 
Among some mismatched wrong year parts he discovered that the shift fork
stuff ( I know more about the surface of Mars than I do about transmissions)
was cobbled together with different year parts which wouldn't let it slide
into 3rd gear in a proper manner.  Jeff said that he would weld 3rd and 4rth
gears which is something that he felt should've been done already.  He did
say that a couple of  good quality parts were used but was puzzled by the
use of some crappy parts.  I also had an exploded bearing in the passenger
side reduction gear box.  They will fix everything with new bearings and
ship it all to me pre-assembled  with one piece boots and all that good
stuff.  It will be around $860 but it's worth it to not have to go through
this again.  I will keep updating this for those interested.
