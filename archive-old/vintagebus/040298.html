I am assuming you mean a double action orbital, instead of just a rotating
grinder style. I would go with that also for sanding a surface for
repainting. Amazing the SCFM they suck up..
I use 80 for paint removal, 100 if I can get away with it.
120-2209 for old paint I'm scuffing that I'd rather not remove, usually the
220.
I never use a sander after primer or a sealer is on, the rest by hand.

We are going to sand some on the 62 deluxe and 63 panel this weekend with a
DAC air sander.  Comments/opinions/warnings/rants (you get the idea) on this
tool and/or grade of paper to use?
