Hi Jason,
Well you could do all the wiring with the package tray in place, but if you 
are doing alot of it, it is a PITA.  So in the long run it is easier to just 
remove tray mounting fasteners and dissconnecting the speedo cable from the 
speedo.  This will allow the package tray to lay on the forward floor out of 
the way.  Eric&amp;Barb
