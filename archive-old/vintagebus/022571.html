Subject: Repop Popout Window Frames - a second opinion...
Message-Id: &lt;3.0.6.32.19990716212808.01a398f0_at_pop_dot_calweb_dot_com&gt;

I got my two repop popout window frames today.  I pulled the first one out
of the box, looked it over, and thought, &quot;Yup, Robert was right.  This
thing is a piece of crap.&quot;

Then I pulled the second one out, and it's not as bad.  I don't know if
it's a fluke or what, but it's fairly close to usable.  I could file the
edges down a tad, and it would make a decent frame.  Why such a big gap in
the quality?

I'm going to give them a call Monday and see if I can return the one frame.

Ironically, when I made the original purchase, I asked him about the
quality, to which he claimed they were excellent, they'd sold tons of them,
and nobody had ever complained.  Hmmmm.  Wonder why he brought it up...
