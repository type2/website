This goes against what others had been told (as she is avoiding me because
she owes me money, I have to go by second-hand word)... that she was not
taking new prepaid orders until she had resolved all the outstanding orders
and refunds.

I was even told 2 months ago by someone in Arizona that they saw that she
actually had the material and so forth and was just weeks away from
completing it.  I pleaded with her to contact me before my wedding and not
any contact.  425 235-9168 is my home phone.  I can't see how she can
possibly have no excuse for not dropping me a 35 cent letter if she doesn't
want to talk to me.  My address that I provided her when she required
pre-payment is still valid (although not current).

I just sent her a check for a bra that she is going to make me---
I just stepped up and thought I'd give her a chance as my past dealings were

good w/ her. That really disappoints me about your canvas...

Good luck and please wish me luck!
- a little worried,
Pete
