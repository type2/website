Subject: Wide engine tidbits...help

Well, it looks like more and more things are unexpectedly (at least by
this novice engine builder) being affected by me shimming my cylinders
to get my CR correct.

I've got .006 inch shims under each cyl. and the slightly affected the
intake fit, and now seem to be affecting the fit of the tin.  The holes
in the cyl covers and behind the pulley tin are off about the same
amount as the cyls are shimmed.  Duh!  Hope the fan shroud fits.

Do most people just dremmel the holes bigger (geez I just spent two days
blasting an painting all that crap)??  Or, is there a difference in
behind the pulley tin between SP and DP motors.  I'm using all my tin
(except the cyl covers of course) from my old DP motor on this SP
motor.  I think I'll just have the damn heads semi hemi cut next time
and save all the hassle a wider engine brings.

Anything else I should look out for??  I've GOT to get this truck
running.  The clock is really ticking.

Thanks.

Steve
