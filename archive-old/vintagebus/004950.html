&gt; O K, I got the big ol' 1914 all smoothed out, got the 3.88 gears. Now that
I
&gt; have enough power to handle it, I would like to go to a tire taller, but
not
&gt; wider than the 165 R 15's. This is on the 63 double cab.

Damn! How fast to you want to go? Rosie will cruise 75-80 (faster if I had
the nerve) with her 2110, 3.88 and 165R15 tires. Gas mileage is 21, but she
won't quite turn a 13 in the quarter mile. What more do you want?

Craig
