&gt;
&gt;I am in need of some assistance via private mail or list. I removed the
&gt;engine (code AH) from my 59 panel as well as the transmission.

An AH engine is from a '72-'74 Bug originally.  Possibly someone has
changed the transmission as well.  Per Muir, the split-case trans
was used through 1959 and chassis 469 506, about 20 000 Buses after
yours.  So yours was *probably* a split-case trans originally.
 
&gt;I need to get inside the case. All the bolts are off but it doesn't
&gt;appear to be coming apart without what feels like excessive force.

Like others have mentioned, are you sure you have a split-case
trans?  Grab http://www.village_dot_org/vw/doc/pdf/5867p3.pdf (thanks
Andrew!!!) and look at the illustrations on page 3 and 6 of the .PDF.

I don't want to be too obvious about this, but stranger things have
happened.  I was 100% sure that I had removed *all* the bolts on
the (cast aluminum) oil pan on my F_at_rd, and that the only thing
keeping it together was time and the gasket.  I was so convinced of
this that I used a bottle jack between the frame and the pan.
Ka-bish, ka-bish, ka-bish, creeeeak...&quot;must be the gasket breaking
lose&quot;...ka-bish, BANG!!! (oil pan) bash-clinkclink! (jack falling
on floor)...oil pan still stuck on block...&quot;WTF?&quot;  (closer inspection)
Hey, there's one more bolt...it's easier to find when there's that
big CRACK in the pan pointing to it...Uhoh.  :)

Good luck!
