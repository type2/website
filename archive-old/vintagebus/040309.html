Subject:  'Early' deluxe clock?
Date: Tue, 11 Jul 2000 08:52:10 +1000
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;


Hi All,

I was cleaning up at the weekend and
come across a deluxe clock that I'd
almost forgotten about.

Anyway, it has the adjustment 'pole'
on the back RHS and I remember seeing a 
photo on Everett Barne's site where
he describes this as an 'early' clock....

Does anyone know what years it is 'correct' for?

thanks
