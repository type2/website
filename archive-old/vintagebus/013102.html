It was a long day, but the weather was great.

Spent 80% of my time in the swap, and 15% hanging out in the '55
in the shade of my tent.  Spent a lot of money on a few parts.
My big scores were a set of ribbed bumpers and an NOS barndoor
steering column lock.  Talked to Clara and Steve, and checked out
Steve's westy, which is really, really cool.  A car like that would
get someone really hot and bothered for a westy!  The other fun
part was watching people's reaction to my friend's 66 ghia convertible,
which I painted a couple months ago.
