Subject: RE: [VB]Factory Tools (Clamp for Red. Box and spring plate...)

Is that the book whose content basically states something like &quot;You Need A Tool Now? Here's what
it looks like and the dimensions... make it your self.&quot;

Can you PLEASE post that book on VintageBus?!?!  Or if anybody knows what I'm talking about,
please post it.  I've never seen one, only have friends and old VW mechs that have.

thanks,
Travis

&gt; Sounds like I'll have to dig out my factory VW tool book for you guys. This
&gt; book has every tool listed for VW's with pics of them all.

&gt;      I suprized to hear no mention of the other wonderful spring plate 
&gt; tools. (brb head'n for the shop).  Bummer mine is numberless, does have a 
&gt; bunch of German writing on it.  I've scored the factory fluid level 
&gt; protractor a few years back.  It makes setting up spring plates a breeze,
&gt; oh, great for checking camber too.   As for the spring plate jack, I made my
&gt; own.
