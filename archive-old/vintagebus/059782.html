Subject: Re: [VB] Forged or not

If this was the only symptom, I guess that would work. However, when I removed the flywheel, shims
and seal, and then moved the crank back and forth in the case, the front bearing had movement in it.
Not much, mind you, only about .001 or .002 in. but still movement.

Most everyone now is telling me this is not acceptable. Continued use will just cause more wear and
further damage to other parts in the engine. I guess the prudent path would be to rebuild. Agree?

&gt; The shims are .010, .008 and .011 in. One of them has a groove worn in it
&gt; where the flywheel was
&gt; turning against it. The mechanic I was talking to said this wear on the shim
&gt; is a symptom of too
&gt; much end play.

Well, since this is where the end play is, I'd expect that wear here would
result in too much end play!  :)

If the shim is worn, and replacement of the shim brings things back into
spec, it this would be the ideal solution!

However, is the shim really worn, or just distorted &quot;dished&quot; by pressure
between the flywheel and the thrust bearing?  I've seen this when the thin
shim is placed next to the thrust bearing.  Since then, I've assembled the
thickest shim against the thrust bearing and the thinnest shim in the
middle of the stack.
