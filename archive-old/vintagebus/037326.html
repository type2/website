Subject: 3.44 report
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com


Lot of talk about transmissions over the last year so I though I would throw 
my 3 cents in (inflation) 

For a trans I run a 3.44 with big nut reduction boxes.  For an engine I have 
a 1776, 110, dual 34 webers and a Thing fanshroud (no heater snouts, better 
cooling)   

I really like this setup a lot.  I generally drive around 65mph and don't 
slow down much on small hills unless pulling a trailer.  Can go faster if I 
wanted but what is the point.  You want to go fast get a motorcycle, you want 
style get a Bus.

Anyway, there seem to be a lot of OPINIONS out there as to what trans setup 
is &quot;The Setup&quot;.  All depends on how and where you drive, what you haul, and 
how fast you want to get where you are going.  The setup I run IS NOT the 
setup you want if you live in a hilly area or have an engine smaller than a 
1776 or you haul heavy loads or live in Death Valley (or other hot area)  

If you live in a fairly flat area, haul light to medium sized loads, want to 
drive 65-70 in a stock height bus without spinning it so fast she will 
explode, a 3.44/big nut is something to consider.  Since I take a trailer to 
just about every event I am contemplating a bigger engine though I think I 
would be fine if I didn't pull a trailer.

Cha ching! .03
