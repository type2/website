Doh.  I meant Rex was here to pick up his '61 23 Window Dlx, NOT a Crew Cab.
The 23-Window I helped him broker a few weeks back:

Yesterday was a busy day -- started out at 7:20am meeting Rex to pick up his
new Double Cab.  Rex has been driving 18 hours + a diversion in Oregon to
check out a '66 Single Cab that was for sale.  ((BTW, about $1000 if anyone
wants details, p-mail me.  Right off of I5.))
