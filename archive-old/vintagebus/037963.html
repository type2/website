yes there is a 59 edition that is for 59 through 62 (post 36hp buses)   I 
found mine at a swap meet and paid I think $180 for it and a 53 edition (I 
had just got my 53) which was probably a good price, but at the time seemed a 
 large chunk of cash for old books.  you could probably find one for less 
that $300, just my opinion, have you looked at swap meets?

there is a 53 ed (barndoor, although mine has some post bd photos in the 
updates)
55 (for post bd 36hp buses)
59 (through 62)
and 63 (through 67)

It is correc there are no reprints for teh earlier books.  The 63 ed is very 
good, but of course not not cover the Original stuff as well.    not that 
great for BD only stuff.
