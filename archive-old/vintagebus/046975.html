Subject: wierd guage action ??
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

so this is the deal I found after wasting hours on it.  I replaced the wires 
from the fromnt under the bus to the back that I had installed for the guage 
senders, with new insulation wrapped stuff, and actually managed the thread 
it through the hollow in the front the main wiring harness feeds through.  I 
got 20', which was a couple feet too long, better safe than sorry.  Nice 
coloured wires so I know I have the guages hooked to the right senders.

But I cant have both my oil pressure and oil temp hooked up, or they read 
wierd.  I tested the wires with an ohmeter the ones from the harness to the 
gauages, everything clean.  I am not sure what the readings  with an ohmeter 
on the guages themselves should be.   The senders are a vdo oil temp in the 
oil pressure relief plug dated 96 I think, and oil pressure/idiot light 
double sender in the oil pressure area, which was new a year ago.  Both read 
fine in my 65, which I pulled the motor out of and swapped it into the 61.

what happens is that if I have the oil pressure, it reads, but lower than the 
guage in the other bus.   Which was tested as accuate just after I installed 
the new sender.  
Then if I hook up the oil temp, the pressure guage peggs out.  But dips 
slightly when I step on the gas.  The oil temp reads near the bottom, though 
this is with a cool motor, so I dunno.  I tryed hooking separate power and 
ground wires, it still makes the guages freak out. 

So what I am wondering is how to test them so I know what is wrong.  I am 
have just the pressure guage installed, but it reads lower than the other bus 
(same motor, I am used to what it reads) so the thing is that I would like to 
pinpoint the error.    It now reads circa 20psi on the freeway not quite 
warmed up, which I doubt is a sudden change the motor had coinciding with 
putting it in the other bus.

These guages came out of a bug that burned in a fire.  They weren't very old 
(a couple years?) but I am wondering if/how that would affect things.   The 
guages were in the front, the fire was at  the motor (are your fuel lines 
secured?), so while they were not directly burned, they surely got odd 
signals.
