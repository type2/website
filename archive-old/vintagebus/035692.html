did you run a wire from  the push on terminal of the starterinto the engine 
compartemnet.    so that you can have ignition on with key, leave bus in 
neutral with parking brake on, and touch that wire to the plus side of the 
battery to start it.  this bypasses all the wires that run from he battery up 
to the ignition switch and back to the starter.   Mke sure the push on you 
use is the correct one, some starters have one that does not work to start 
the bus.

if it works with this , then you problem is somewhere in the bypassed 
circuit.  If it doesn, then there is a problem smewhere in the back.  hope 
this helps.
