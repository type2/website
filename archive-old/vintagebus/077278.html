Nope.
I don't suscribe to the dark side.
Just been lurking.
I had to calm down work on my '67 Panel cause my wife
had our first child, a son called Bryn, on 29th
January.
He's home now though so maybe the under body on the
panel will get another look in between nappies, baths
&amp; feeding.
He came out 9 pound 5.5 ounces &amp; he just keeps getting
bigger ;o)
:o)
Cheers &amp; God Bless
