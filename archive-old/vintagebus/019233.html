In short, the Japanese were buying up all of the good VW stuff at
exhorbitant prices, and thus causing runaway &quot;VW inflation&quot; -
raising the price expectations for all other VW stuff.  The subsequent
speculation in VW parts has caused quite a bit of angst in the VW 
community, and is a sore subject with many (hence my wanting to save it
for Friday)

&gt; which it is sparking?
