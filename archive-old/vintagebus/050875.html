Subject: Re: [VB] Cant get Tie Rod off

Tie rod puller. It's like a gear puller. Alot of parts houses have them for
rent or even for free. I have done it with a C-clamp, but your curseword
vocabulary has to be up to snuff, although you can use the same couple of
words over and over with changes in volume.

Subject: [VB] Cant get Tie Rod off


&gt; Subject line pretty much sez it all!!!!
&gt;
&gt; The ones on the driver's side came off just fine.  However the one on the
&gt; passenger side (the one that was bad) wont budge.  Ive beat on it, shot it
&gt; full of WD40 and I even used nasty words.  Still no luck.
&gt;
&gt; Ideas????
&gt;
&gt; Thanks in advance!!
