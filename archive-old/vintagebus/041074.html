Eric, I believe you may also have the option of adjusting the position of the steering wheel without removing it. I think you can adjust the position of the arm (can't remember what it's called) on the steering gear box. Of course, you'll have to remove the arm from the gearbox. I think you would: 

Without crawling under my bus in my good pants, I can't say for sure, but maybe someone else will be kind enough to address this issue. If you remember what that arm is called, I'm pretty sure you could find this discussed in the archives.

I have rarely removed a steering wheel without damaging it some...the trick is patience and the right tools...and a little more patience, I think.

Good luck! Joe
