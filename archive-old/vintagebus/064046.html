Subject: RE: [VB] $100 reward for felts

I've been tempted often by this thought of buying another bus for critical
parts... there was an early 60's double cab recently that sold in Monterey
that I tried to buy just for the interior.  But really, my search for parts
hasn't been all that lengthy.  Now I have often tried to find *nicer* pieces
than those that I currently have.  Plus, if I bought another bus, the wife
wouldn't be too happy with me (except she said if i could find her a Nov.
19, 1957 deluxe bus, I could buy it... but i digress)

Then again, searching for odd ball parts is fun and it's entertaining to
cause controversy :-)


BTW, i'd really like to see a few pics of og truck felts that any of you
might have.  I think I have a picture from a 66 coming my way.  Anyone with
an earlier truck?

Everett thought:
I think Mr. Mayes would be better off purchasing a rusty but all original
Single or Double Cab from which to remove parts from.  I have seen several
for sale since his search for original parts began and I have a feeling
he is getting close to, or may have surpassed, their asking prices.
