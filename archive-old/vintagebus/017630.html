Oldscholvw_at_aol_dot_com mentioned that the recent
Bug-O-Rama swap area was similar to the Pomona cars FS
area. I agree that in the past the Pomona cars FS area
was seemingly a &quot;safe haven&quot; for under age and out of
control all night partying and thievery. It is
understood to remain as a den of thieves.
I attended last weekend's Pomona and slept in my '54
Barnambulator with one eye opened all night. My
observation was that it was far more tame than any of
my previous infrequent visits to Pomona. I purposely
slept in the bus with all of the curtains open and
parked directly under a light in the front (most
visible)row.
My general observation was that security was greatly
increased and seemed to squelch the on-going all night
cruising of the thumping gansta rap mobiles and out of
control drinking. I did have someone open the door to
my bus at about 3AM with a startled apologetic
exclamation that can't be included verbatim in this
post and immediately retreated. The invader was
supposedly vaguely associated with an acquaintance.

Bottom line is that tight security and self-control
are  good things. Thieves should be publicly mutilated
right after the engine blow and bikini contests.
