1.  on the positice side I have driven from near Cheyenne Wyoming to near 
Tonopah Nevada with my gen light on.   COuld have gone further if it didn't 
get dark and I had to turn the headlight son, when the bus suddenly died.  So 
you can go a long way during the day on a full battery.

Did you check how tall your brushes were?  is the bit the brushes rides on 
nice and shiney?

 Fast forward to Bishop, CA.  Stopped for gas, and upon restart the
 generator
 light stayed on.  Checked belt, pushed on brush springs and wiggled
 connections, no change. Revved engine up and light went out and stayed
 out!  
 
 Good, I just decided not to
 shut things down until I got home, 160 miles away.  Got dark, turned
 lights on, took voltage reading 13.2v.  So far so good.  10 miles south of
 Walker, CA the gen light came on suddenly and brightly.  Checked belt and
 wiggled connections again, no effect.  Revved engine again, no effect.
 Drove on battery to Walker (barely made it) and called it a night.  Slept
 in bus (first time I wished I had a Westy!)
 
 Next morning, Dad brought me a fresh battery and I drove the remaining 50
 miles to Carson City in daylight.  Voltage held steady at 12.6v,
 indicating that I was getting a bit of charge.  At idle, battery dropped
 to 12.5v.  Light is still on continuously, but isn't as intimidating in
 the daytime :)
 
 Unfortunately, the Bentley and Muir manuals are 400 miles away.  What is
 the list_wisdom on this?  I was going to start with the regulator, but
 does someone have a better idea?  Any tests to try?  I know that Bentley
 had nice detailed tests, but I don't remember them (darn).
 
 I have a job to do in eastern Nevada for today and tomorrow.  Luckily I
 don't need the bus for that.  I'll check back in a day or so to see what
 the almighty list comes up with!
