Subject: i need color info

I just bought a 1965 kombi standard a few weeks ago and I want to paint it 
semi-correctly inside and out.  I know this was originally all light grey, but i 
want to go with two tone outside - it was painted white over yellow by 
someone which is what it is right now.  I was wondering - on the two tone later 
busses, how do they make the transition from the two tone exterior to the 
interior?  If I paint the dash and all interior grey, what is the correct method to 
paint the door jambs and inside of doors?  Do you stop/start the color chabge 
behind the door seals?  Do you paint the dash the exterior lower color and all 
the rest grey?
