Subject: Should I sell the spindles?

------=_NextPart_000_0054_01C1FC30.EE76D700
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

After I did the lowering and installing the highway transmission in the =
'63 Sundial, I have both the old spindles and a tranny left over. I have =
some garage clearing to do.

I can send the spindles to Wolfgang for the $100 core credit, Or I can =
sell them.

Do the spindles have more value to an individual than that?

And is the original tranny of any real value?

I have a good home for the tranny, if I don't sell it, it will go to =
good use.
