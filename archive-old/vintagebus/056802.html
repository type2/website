Hi Al,
Stock sized jetting for a 30PICT 30-3 on a 1970 bus is 112.5 main, 140Z air 
correction, pilot jet g 65, and pilot jet air bleed 135.
  So it sounds like you are running a bit too small or just right sized of 
pilot jet and way too small of pilot air bleed.  You also mention stock air 
cleaner, but for what year?  If you are running a pre-1968 bus air cleaner 
the stock jetting will run a bit rich.
