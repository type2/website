&gt;
&gt;&gt; hi listees, kelly,  - welding questions: i have a stress crack i'd like to
&gt;&gt; nip and wonder what would be the best welding method to repair it. two
&gt;&gt; inches, passenger side door, above the side mirror. i've heard a braze
&gt;&gt; would be best, but a neighbor has oxy acetylene and is glad to do it. i'm
&gt;&gt; unsure that might be too hot.
&gt;
&gt;Hmmm...the real choice here is between oxyacetylene fusion welding and
&gt;brazing, since most brazing is done with oxyacetylene as heat. I have a
&gt;feeling you don't have access to a MIG or TIG setup, and you definitely
&gt;don't want to try this with a stick welder.
&gt;
&gt;If your neighbor's real good at sheet-metal welding, I'd go that way.
&gt;--jmowreader

i gave the welding supply house a call for recommendations. they gave me a
short list of good brazers, and the one closest to me turned out to be a
good fellah. oxy/acet with a handheld stick of something. rough grinding to
knock off the bigger stuff.  i took it home to file and sand, until it
looked like a gold filling. now in primer, i am grateful and hats to the
list.   another 35 years for this door

thanks all for your input on this. some folks around town suggested it'd be
cheaper to just hang a scrapyard door instead of hiring skilled labor.
turned out to be a ten dollar or in-trade choice. a better way to go.
