Subject: Re: Rheostat vs Voltage Drop?

&gt;
&gt;All this talk about rheostats, but... havent herd anything about VD
&gt;resistors...  last month I scored a bugpack VD,

I hear that dancing with oneself can be an effective way to resist VD, as
long as you wash your hands first.  Since you're past that point already,
penicillin may help.

&gt;12 to 6v, pn 3598... anyone ever use one of these?

Never used one, but it looks a lot like a &quot;standard&quot; aluminum cased power
resistor, like a Huntington Electric TMC-50 series (see
http://www.heiresistors_dot_com/aluminum.htm ) or Dale/Vishay RH-50 series (see
http://www.vishay_dot_com/docs/30201/rhnh.pdf ).  Huntington's data sheet says
its resistors are rated at 50 W at 25 C ambient only when mounted to a
5&quot;x7&quot;x0.040&quot; piece of aluminum.  This derates to around 45 W at 50 C.  With
no heat sink, they're only good for about 20 W at 25 C, derating to about
17 W at 50 C.  Dale requires a 12&quot;x12&quot;x0.059&quot; piece of aluminum as a heat
sink to get the same numbers and deratings.  There may be a typo in the
Huntington data sheet, because their other numbers are the same as Dale.
