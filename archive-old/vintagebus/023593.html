Subject: Re:hoops for single cabs
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

Hi everybody,
    I have been looking for a set of hoops for my 57 singlecab and none are 
to be found. I know that you can get the canvas from PLF, but nobody seems to 
have the afformentioned hoops, or know where to get some.  Would anybody know 
how much $ they would cost if a set did show up. Or what about fabricating 
them, I have the truck parts book and the expanded view doesn't look like 
there was alot to it.  I would just need the dimensions for the hoop. Has 
anyone attempted this? Any help would be greatfully appreciated. 
   Another question would be why can you get the hoops and canvas for 68 and 
later trucks???
                                                 Steve
