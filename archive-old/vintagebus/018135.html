Very Superstitious...

Yeah after marketing the snot out of that bus I
figured that I would wait until the thing was on the
boat. Yup it sold. Yup, still maintain that it was a
very nice bus for what it was. Solid driver, excellent
mechanicals. Cursed because of the lack of a big rear
deck.
Heard from a Japanese gentleman at last weekend's OCTO
that the barnambulator, or campulance as the VTO guys
call it, has already been featured in a couple mags as
part of the American Scene and OCTO/Classic Weekend
report.
Had to chuckle at today's discussion over 21 vs 23 and
supposed &quot;value&quot; based upon rarity in numbers. If
based soley on numbers with a dash of early vintage as
factors then the ambulances in whatever current
config/condition and specialty vehicles would be the
hot ticket. Basically it boils down to the trendiness
in the market. Notice that I failed to use the word
hobby. The ambulance was one of 500 or so barney ambos
produced between 1952-2/1955. Only 24 currently known
to be taking up space on the planet.
Before everyone who currently owns, once owned, ever
wanted to own a deluxe bus, ever walked by a deluxe or
is currently marketing a deluxe bus crawls up my arse~
PLEASE understand that I like deluxes. I think that
their only fault is that they are such a b*tch to camp
in with all of that sunlight coming in! I watched Tom
Brioulette try to sleep in April, his former and
beautiful deluxe, at an early Jerome. He crawled out
all bent, hunched over and folded in the morning.
Living in Phoenix Arizona with over seven months of
intense heat screaming in on you and a deluxe bus, to
me, makes no sense. More than likely would result in a
red~ neck. ;-) Phoenix has too many already.
Yes, I would have loved to have held on to the bus and
yes, the wolves have been pushed back a few feet. No,
not rich- sold the thing for the reasons that were
tauted for months- paying the bills and helping Mom to
stay home and raise our baby for as long as we can
manage. It's a nice trade. =) I'll take my girls over
metal any day.
