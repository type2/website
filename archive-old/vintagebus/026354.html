Hi List

So i finally got my air cleaner installed but i think i may have a
problem.  I really had to struggle to get it on the carb.  There is a
support in the top of the engine bay that is in the way.  If the carb
was 1/4&quot; lower or 1/2&quot; to either the front or the back then there would
be no problem at all - I wonder what's wrong?

What does list wisdom suggest i use for preheater hose?  I cant seem to
find anything to fit.  I have a piece of PVC hose that is pretty close
to the right diameter  but ...  it's for water lines .... and .... that
aint right!  What to do, what to do ....

On the up side it feels really nice to have the proper air cleaner and i
dont notice any change in how the mango warrior runs and ...... the
engine bay just looks so ...... vintage:)

TIA
