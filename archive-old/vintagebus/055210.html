Subject: Re: [VB] Where are all the middle seats?

OK,

I'll admit that when I was 17, my parents let two Afghan hounds sleep in=20=

the garage. (they were lost or loose or something) I had been working on=20=

the bus and forgot to close the cargo door.

Of course they tore up the interior - what else are Afghans supposed to=20=

do?

I was young, pissed off and stupid (what a seriously bad combo) and=20
tossed out the seats in the nearest dumpster.

Many sleepless nights have passed since then. (I sure hope God doesn't=20=

pull that card on me in front of the pearly gates.)

Someone on this list was selling an entire interior for $850. Believe=20
me, if I had that kind of cash I would be there. But I don't, and the=20
bus will have just one backseat (thanks to Jes=FAs) - with lots of leg=20=

room.

Conrad
