I think you misunderstood: the halfway point shuts off the gas, so you're
only using up the gas in the line and in the float bowl.  

All you have to do is push the cable back down, and you're on &quot;normal&quot; fuel
draw again.

On bugs, there was an accessory extension for the reserve lever, which
actually read &quot;A&quot; &quot;Z&quot; and &quot;R&quot;

&gt;Well, yes.  But then to get fuel flowing again, you have to leave it
&gt;in reserve, which means you're SOL if you don't keep a close eye on
&gt;the odometer.  Unless you've got a trick for getting it to go back to
&gt;the main-only position....
