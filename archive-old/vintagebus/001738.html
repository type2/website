Just want to thank Everret B. and his web page. Had so many people email on
my 64 camper for sale from his page, he must get a millon hits a day. Sold
the camper to 1st person, and now need to really get to work on the  57 dd
walkthru repo camper. If Thom will sell me the drivers walkthru seats and
camper windows from his FREE 60 walkthru it will help. HOW MUCH THOM ?
Anyway, thanks Everret. See you all at BBBIV Jan. 21,22,23,2000
