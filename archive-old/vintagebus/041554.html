Subject: '71 gas tank will not fit in '67 body
Message-ID: &lt;Pine.BSF.4.05.10003191951550.18059-100000_at_mtolympus.ari_dot_net&gt;

Volks,

Went over to Pat Flynn's place today to putter about with the '67.  My
task for the day was to pull and inspect the gas tank.  I *love* working
on this bus!! :-))  Everything is so open and spacious (OK, not perfect...
getting to the outlet pip underneath was tight :-)  As the tank came out,
tho, I herd a rattle inside it and once out, I suspect strongly that
someone added at least one handful of gravel/sand if not more :-(  That's
OK, tho... first, the '67 tank goes into the V'gon to be taken home for
cleaning... I figured I would be doing that anyway, from the color of the
gas that came out of it :-)  Then I went to Pat Flynn's '71 carcass... it
still had the gas tank and I remember hearing that the '68-71 tanks fit in
the splittie body.  Pulled that tank (*much* worse job) and took it over
to the '67 to install temporarily (I would love to have this bus roadable
by everybus).  I would love to be proved wrong, but I could *not* get that
tank in.  The distance from the top of the trans hump to the bottom of the
crossbeam under the rear deck is 1/2&quot; shy of clearing the tank.  Is it
some smaller year-range of bay tanks that fit splitties?  Or is there a
secret (I tried feeding the tank in from the side, wont fit :-(  I am very
unwilling to &quot;adjust&quot; the body for a temporary tank... I want the original
tank in once I get to that point in the resto, but I want to get the bus
on the road in &lt; a month (I may be just too optimistic :-)
