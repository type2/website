not only do i own a small vw shop with machine service,  i offered to take
it to another shop to have it checked to prove i was not pulling a fast one.
its bad enough that you could see it from 3 feet away if you saw it from the
back.   anyway it did not care that i offered this.  and to all i tried to
handle this off the list, and he said oh well as is no refunds.   then i
left him neg feedback about the condition if the item,   in return he left
me some that made it sound like i never evan paid for it.   i paid with a
credit card to pay pal so he got paid super fast.   i thank you all for your
support, and i am sorry for the amount of emails about this.    p.s. if you
guys remember i bought a nos case a few months ago for 800.00   from split
window jim so i dont think i am outside my means to pay 400.00   for
another,   evan used but usable std i would be ok with this.    thanks all
for your support.    AND BEWARE OF SCAMS

&gt; &gt; by this guy (mr.kdf)  i got a listed as
&gt; &gt; nos
&gt; &gt; 36hp case from him that he stated he did not know for
&gt; &gt; sure if it was
&gt; &gt; nos,
&gt; &gt; but it showed no signs of wear and had old flaking
&gt; &gt; cosmilne on it.&quot;&lt;&lt;
&gt;
&gt; &gt; It seems in truth, there is not
&gt; &gt; a problem with the case as much as the buyer was
&gt; &gt; apparently bidding outside of his means.
&gt;
&gt; Since there seems to be quite a difference between &quot;no signs of wear&quot; and
&gt; &quot;completely unusable&quot;, the solution to this problem seems pretty simple.
&gt;
&gt; Take the case to a machine shop knowlegeable in these cases and acceptable
&gt; to both parties.  Let them decide if the case is usable or not.  If the
&gt; case is usable, then the buyer pays for the inspection, keeps the case,
&gt; and pays the seller what he bid.  If the case in indeed trashed, the
&gt; seller pays for the inspection, gets his case back and refunds the buyer's
&gt; money.
&gt;
&gt; This would seem to be a lot more productive than taking potshots at each
&gt; other on the list.
