I'm thinking about trying to track what articles are in Hot VW and VW
trends.  I know I probably have to much time on my hands that could probably
be better spent working on VWs but my wife makes me stop working out in the
garage when she goes to bed.  Are there any software programs that allow you
to enter articles and track them by subject?  TIA
