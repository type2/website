Subject: Re: [VB] Does your bus tow a trailer?

I would like to tow my beetle with my bus, has anybody tried this before?
If so, were any problems encountered(other than finding a hitch to use)?
Thanks.

&gt; If so, contact me.  I want to put a hitch on my 60 truck to pull light
&gt; loads.  MANY people have emailed offlist wanting to do the same, but no
&gt; solutions yet.  Looking for recommendations, parts source, etc.  Any
&gt; advice appreciated. Jay 60 Double Cab
