Dear listee's

Just an FYI on a few parts that I have for sale.  These three are currently 
on E-Bay (please hold back the firing squad).

VW Volkswagon Blaupunkt Radio GREAT CONDITION
http://cgi.ebay_dot_com/aw-cgi/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&amp;item=230597073

(Actually have a box of original radios at home....  All different models.)

VW Volkswagon Air Vents *Great Condition*
http://cgi.ebay_dot_com/aw-cgi/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&amp;item=230600018

(Have a box of these vents at home in varing colors and condition.)

Orig. VW Volkswagon Speedometer Dated 4-67
http://cgi.ebay_dot_com/aw-cgi/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&amp;item=230604493

(Have a box of these at home with all different dates and could be different 
models)

If you are interested in these... please bid away...   But if you are 
looking for one like it let me know because I have a bunch of like items 
like the ones above and would be willing to sell directly to interested 
listees.  Don't exactly know what is there so send me a message with what to 
look for and I will try to locate it.  Anyway, I hope this helps those out 
there in need of good original VW parts.

Mike
