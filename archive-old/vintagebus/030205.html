Subject: [VB] T4 cylinders needed

I was very curious about this conversion. But it sounded too good to be
true. So a while back, I emailed Bob Hoover for his input. He informed
me the tranny would not handle the torque. Since then, I have seen from
those that have attempted it, that Bob was correct. Even with the back
hanger, the tranny will very likely crack. Seems to me that, to do the
conversion, one must also put a type 4 tranny in the bus.
