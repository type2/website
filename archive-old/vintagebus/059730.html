Subject: 67 bus wheel cylinders

Hello all

I just returned from my local auto parts store, where I had ordered some new
front wheel cylinders. When I opened the boxes, I saw they did not have the
adjustment wheel (for setting the brake shoes) as part of the wheel
cylinder.  Is this correct?  Do you reuse the old adjustment wheel??  They
pulled out several parts catalogues, and the ilustration did not show the
wheel. So perhaps they are correct??

Thanks for any clarification!

Bob
