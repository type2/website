Subject: Re: [VB] Listee stickers?

&gt; Crusty Van Bondage

Yeah, that describes him.

&gt; I really enjoy meeting new listees at the
&gt; shows...but since there are so many 
&gt; of us, and no real way of recognition, I'm thinking
&gt; of this - small simple window sticker 
&gt; stating 'vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com' 

I agree, but we ought to have a lapel pin, too.  Or
some way to identify ourselves while wandering around
shows.  Orange hats like P&amp;C?  I've been to lots of
shows where I had no idea who the listees were.  And
then I read later that someone was there.  At my age,
even the guys I know should have name tags!  I
remember you though, Beto.
