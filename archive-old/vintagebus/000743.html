&lt;&lt; I couldn't figure out how the venting works... is it around the sides of 
the inside, or are there tiny holes in the center of the cap? &gt;&gt;
Hi Stephen,
Through the center.  There is actually a set of plates inside that create a 
double spiral passageway to allow the vapor out, but keep the fluid in.
