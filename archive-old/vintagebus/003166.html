We were lucky to have a dry clear morning after what seemed to be a almost
sure rainy day.  I think the predicted bad weather kept more than a few
folks away.  We arrived at about 10am and found about 18 or so type-IIs on
hand and only 3 or 4 swap meet folks.  Saw a really nice red crew cab
(thanks for the inspiration dude!) and a nice 23 window and several other sc
and dc's to give me plenty of ideas for this winters dc project.

Anybody know what size tires I should put on my 59 dc?    (JUST KIDDING!)
