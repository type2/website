&gt;There was a post about a caravan leaving around noonish on Friday from the 
&gt;Berdo/ Riverside area. I lost the e mail (It's here
&gt;somewhere). If you could please shoot me the info on time and place to 
&gt;meet up. Thanks!



from George:
AFAIK, I'll be meeting up with Mike Visket at the Pines Cafe
for a massive yummy breakfast 8:00AM Friday. The Pines is on the
Pearblossom cutoff between the 14 freeway and state highway 138.
Take the 5 freeway N, switch to the 14 freeway. Take the Pearblossom
exit. Go through several stoplights and the Pines will be on the left on
the downhill before you intersect Hwy 138)
If you don't get there for breakfast, you'll probably catch up to my
lethargic '71, as we cruise at about 58MPH. We'll cruise across the 138
to Victorville and thence on the 15 and 40 to the Havasu turnoff
FRS Channel 2. CB channel 2.
