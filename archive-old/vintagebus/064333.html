Subject: Re: [VB] Funny trans noise

The throwout bearing is spinning when you step on the clutch.
The trans input shaft stops spinning when you step on the clutch.
I would be more inclined to believe the input shaft bearing in the
transmission is bad.
NOT the pinion bearing, it only turns when you are moving.
Parked, with the engine running, foot off the clutch: only the input shaft is
turning.

&gt; &gt; Urm, but the noise went away when I pushed on the clutch; the TOB
&gt; &gt; should not be doing anything at that point.

&gt; &gt; &gt; My bus has developed a funny trans noise, and it's almost funny
&gt; &gt; &gt; as in 'ha ha!' funny.  I was at a light this AM, out of gear,
&gt; &gt; &gt; foot off the clutch, and I revved it a little to get some heat
&gt; &gt; &gt; flowing.  It started making a Three Stooges sort of &quot;woo-woo-woo!&quot;
&gt; &gt; &gt; sound, which gave me a little giggle, even though I know it's not
&gt; &gt; &gt; a good thing.  The noise went away when I put the clutch in.
