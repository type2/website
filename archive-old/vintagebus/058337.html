Subject: RE: [VB] Glueing Insulation

I glued in my custom cut 2lb polyeurothane 1/2&quot; pieces to my door skin.
Since this winter without any door panels or insulation, I noticed a large
amount of condensation. I chose the polyeurothane for the doors and the
ceiling so as to not soak up the water. Also, I put up a visqeen barrier to
further keep out the outside enviroment.

How bad is glueing insulation to the skin of our VW's?  Will that lock in
moisture?  Is it better to tape it in place?  What was the factory option?

&lt;&lt; In the library at www.type2_dot_com there is an excellent article on

up
 and read it.

ya- except he tells you to use spray foam- which is obviously a sign of
being 
possessed by a demon- as spray foam encourages rust.

I get road noise- adding a front floor mat and pedal splash pan helps.
a 
seconf floor mat may help more.   Good heat tubes and heat on adds
engine 
noise.    So you may want to leave your heat off
