&lt;&lt; Anyway, I bought those rubber stoppers and want to install them.  I need
 to know how far (inches or cm) from the edge of the door I should put
 them.  I suppose I could guess but I sorta want to do it as close to
 stock as possible. &gt;&gt;
Hi Darin,
First you need to get a 1972 and later MC for your bus.  This is the one we
know will fit 1955-67 and has the dual circuit for safety.  You can use a
rabbit resivoir or your 1967 is a little better.  Then you need to make a
spacer from 1/4&quot; steel to shim the MC toward the rear and shorten the
adjustable push rod.  
As for the rubber stops, your bus should have come with them from the factory.
Take off the door panels and you will probably find the mounting holes that
were puttied up by the PO.    Eric &amp; Barb
