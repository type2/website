Subject: brake upgrade, heater channels, fuel gauge, rivets

    Thanks to Cal G. and Jason W. for the help. I don't know how I missed
those rivets at Wolfsburg West. And I'll try the Vise-Grip maneuver.
    As to the MC, I'm gonna go ahead and get the Brazilian one since no one
has any gore-riddled testimonies to sway me otherwise.
    That elastomer sleeve for the heater channels looks to be perfect, though
it is a little pricey. Hmm... do we want that new car radio/CD player with the
satellite receiver for non-stop tunes on the road, or a warm interior.
    I'll definitely get the new gas gauge though. Hate to walk across the
desert ala Clark Griswold due to an error in fuel level judgment. Thanks
again,
Rocco
