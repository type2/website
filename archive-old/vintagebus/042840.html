Hey folks.

We should be alive with this message.  Unfortunetly, some of the mail
between 8ish eastern Friday, and now, got lost, eaten, or bounced.

I do apoligize.  What was supposed to be a simple copy-n-swap turned into
a two day nightmare. *sigh*

This is also a test message...if you get this, we are alive.;)

later...david
