well i got the case apart today, it is no good, would need to bored again to
be used, and has already been bored...reccomendation, get a new engine.

looking to ronnie to get a new one.

my original is a 1600 single port, the new ones are dual port, so i believe i
will need a new carb(the 28 pict won't fit the new manifold)

My options:
30/31 pict electric choke
34-pict-3
or something else?

what do you guys recommend?
Mileage/reliability is more important than acceleration.

any reccommendations, suggestions?
