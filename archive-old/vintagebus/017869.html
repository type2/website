Subject: (Almost) free roof clip~ Phoenix

(Serious)

Attn all of the scrappy cheap assed Phoenix guys!

Damned near free roof clip from a '67 13 window. Was
intended for a &quot;future project&quot;. Not needed now. 
I know of at least one 15 window in the Phoenix metro
area with a heat warped roof. All cuts below or at the
belt line. Will make a killer dog shelter or cover for
your black widow spider collection. Excellent for
giving the kids Tetnus.

Could make a creative rear cover for your single
cab...
Take it to the dump for scrap weight as far as I care.
Get it the F out of my back yard. Make it the starting
point for Jerome raffle bus XI. (But dude, its OEM)
Put it on eBay and retire!

No shipping- You haul it away. Take what's under it
too. Must take all.
Trade for a six pack of Fat tire amber ale or self
supporting 12V starter. Willing to share the beer.

Can anyone lend me a Sawz-All if it doesn't disappear soon?
