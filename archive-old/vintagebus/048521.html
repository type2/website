I've had pretty good luck with a kerosene heater for the garage. Keep the
doors cracked or its headache city.

I think it's from an old russian MIG-15, as much noise as it makes. I just
stay away from the intake so nothing gets sucked in. I haven't had to use
it much this winter, but this mild weather can't last forever.
