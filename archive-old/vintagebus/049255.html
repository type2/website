Hello out there,

I recently acquired a pair if 356/912 porsche cylinder heads that were included in a engine purchase for my 65 bus.  Since I don't have a 356, I don't really have a need for these.  They are in excellent shape, one cylinder has some minor dings in it from what looks like something unfriendly being in the combustion chamber. 
My question is, can these be used on a VW block? If yes, is this advisable? If no, is anyone interested in these?  I'm in Ventura, CA.
         I also have another question.  The motor I got has been sitting for years. I changed the oil and it starts up fine and runs.  The cylinder ports were blackened though with crud and I'm wondering the best way to clean this crap out. Should I do the muir book and run diesel thru there? Any advice is appreciated.
Thanks
Jon
