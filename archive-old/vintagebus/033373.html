&lt;&lt; I really don't know why a few (very few) mildly negative posts has caused
 this type of reaction.  Maybe you just had a bad day. &gt;&gt;

week make things a little stressful.  Luckily the wife is understanding and 
has a good job.  Sorry guys and gals, but please think before you type...and 
I will try to do the same.
