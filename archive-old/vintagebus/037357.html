&lt;&lt; 1) How likely is it that damage was done to the rods or head bolts by my
 attempt to start a hydrolocked engine?&gt;&gt;
 Hi Dave,
Hopefully if you only tried the one time to start the engine it should be
fine.

&lt;&lt; 2) How likely is it that &quot;something&quot; caused the float to stick?  (Note,
 there was no gas filter, but the tank had recently been cleaned and sealed)&gt;&gt;
Well it could be that the float shut off valve stuck, or not tightened
properly, or the float is too heavy, or has gotten a leak in it so it will
not float.  Get a filter in the system, even though you just cleaned the
tank.  Also did you put in the filter sock in the bottom of the tank?

&lt;&lt; 3) What do I do with the remains of the mechanic?&gt;&gt;
Since you are in San Diego you might take him on a nice long fishing trip
with only you to returning!   Eric&amp;Barb
