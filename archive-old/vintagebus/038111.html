I'm with Daniel and Barry on the Australian theory. I've got a '65 and no

sign of an M-code plate, and no indications of one ever existing!

chris writ:
I have read that type1's were shipped out CKD (complete knock down) and
assembled in various markets. Were any buses done this way?  I know it seems
unlikley due to the monocoque nature of the bus but it seems odd that all
these Aussie buses are missing something that would tell the factory workers
in Germany what mods (m-codes) to make to a bus for its intended market. 

This could be m-code 0000 : remove m-code plate and ship it to the antipods
:)&gt;

fig writ:


I can't speak for Australian buses, but VW Transporters sold in South
Africa were assembled here from CKD kits since August 1955.

I have never seen an m-code plate on SA-assembled buses. Locally assembled
VW Transporters have a VIN plate under the front passenger seat (LHS),
which includes model# and chassis# and max axle weights, but no colours or
options.

VWSA kept no records and cannot even tell you the year a vehicle was built
from the VIN#.

sounds likely that the aussie buses are like the SA ones.
