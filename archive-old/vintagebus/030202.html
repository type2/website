The gas mileage you get with a freeway flier is higher than the gas
mileage from a stock geared tranny. I've seen for myself that this is
true under all of the driving conditions I normally encounter.

The bus is also quieter inside due to lower engine rpm's.

I'm sure a lowered bus would get better gas mileage if it didn't have
the RGB's, but it wouldn't look as cool. It would also get hung up on
the high spots in my driveway, which would make it hard for you to get
to where I keep my homebrew if you ever wanted to come by here on one of
your cross country trips.

&gt; I just got back from a trip from here in dallas to stockton california
&gt; and back in the 65 bus. I had just finished coating the interior in
&gt; por-15 and then spraying it with noisekiller. The noise was less in the
&gt; bus and will prbably be even better when I finally get the interior
&gt; pannels done in the bus, but it is still pretty loud up near 4000 rpm. I
&gt; would appriciate any experience other people here have had in reducing
&gt; freeway noise in their bus. Also while I was up in stockton, I found a
&gt; swingaxle kit for my bus that was inexpensive. I had been considering
&gt; putting in a freeway flyer tranny, but I met someone who was raving
&gt; about how much better his bus handled on the freeway since he lowered
&gt; it. I would like a little better speed on the freeway without winding
&gt; out the motor, but I have heard stories about bad gas mileage with the
&gt; freeway flyer. I wanted to know if this was true and if  it was true
&gt; with swingaxle swap. The ground clearance is nice , but we do a lot of
&gt; cross country traveling  in the bus, so anything that would improve that
&gt; experience would be great.
