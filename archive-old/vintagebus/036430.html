&lt;&lt; HELP! I need the following for a 5/10/61 built hatchtop, flipseat
 Westfalia, vin #  776553:
 1) does anyone have a bus of any kind with a vin number within 250 either
 way? I need to compare notes. &gt;&gt;

Hi Jon,
Our Westie is a March of 62 built model.

&lt;&lt;   2) what are the correct markings for the taillight lenses? &gt;&gt;

If you have the later plastic oval shaped tail lights they should have &quot; SAE 
STIA 61&quot; the 61 means the year the mold was made.

&lt;&lt; 3) what is the height of the table post? anyone have one to loan or sell?  
&gt;&gt;

Ours is 28-7/16&quot; tall and 1.385&quot; diameter.  With a taper about 1-3/4&quot; long 
and finishing in a diameter of 1.325&quot;.  Make sure to keep the tapered end and 
the holes it goes into greased.  We had to chop out the original leg out of 
ours due to being rusted in place.

&lt;&lt; 4) anyone parted or parting out a flipseat recently? i need some small 
parts. &gt;&gt;

What do you need?

&lt;&lt; 5) anyone have or seen another mouse grey/pearl white flipseat westy?  have
 any pics i could be emailed? &gt;&gt;

Only in Westie factory pictures.
Eric&amp;Barb
