Right under the seal on the frame there should be two screws on each side of
the frame....... try and get these screws out. Be patient though since these
might be tough to remove, take your time.

Good luck

André



&gt; How does the glass come out of the Frames, from the Popout Windows?  I got
&gt; my 66 towed here today and was trying to figure out how to get the glass
out
&gt; of the frames.  Obviously I'm not seeing something, cause I can't figure
it
&gt; out.
