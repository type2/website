&gt;i red in th type2_dot_com archives that you can make 
&gt;roof rack clamps out of turnbuckels.
&gt;
&gt;can i ask what is a turnbuckle??

No affiliation with the company, etc.  Just some pictures of
turnbuckles.  The ones you need for a roof rack are smaller but
the same idea.

&gt;ive seen them on wwf not at home depot.

Tip: Home Depot is not a real hardware store.  Find a real hardware
store, like a True Value or Ace Hardware (in the US).  In an
Oklahoma town of about 12,000 people, I could buy stainless steel
metric fasteners on Sunday at the True Value store.  One way to
tell a good hardware store: their hardware does not come in little
bags, or have bar code stickers attached.  If you're not sure,
grab a random bolt and take it to the check out.  If the cashier
has to call someone or flips open a book to get a code number,
it's not a real hardware store.  If they ask you &quot;How much was
this?&quot;, and key up &quot;misc hardware&quot; for whatever price you tell
them, it's a real hardware store.

Other hardware store stuff:
You may want to bring a pen and a bit of paper when shopping so
you can note the prices.  They usually give you little bags to
put your parts in.  The nice thing about loose hardware is that
you can take in a piece from your VW that you're not sure about
and try different nuts, bolts, etc, until you find the right one.
If the first part you try doesn't go easy, don't force it...put
it back and try a different diameter or thread pitch.  If you need
a whole bunch of one part, pull the drawer out further...there is
usually a box of 50 or 100 lurking back there.  If you take their
last one of something, it's nice to let the cashier know so they
can put some on their next order. 

Good luck!
