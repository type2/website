I am now on my 3rd set of caps in less than a year!!!  Does anyone else have
problems with parts walking away from your bus?  Is there a way to lock caps
down?  Im ready to start sleeping with a shotgun in the back.  Just last
week I found my &quot;64Type2&quot; vanity plate with one screw out and the other
halfway out.  It is now taped inside my back window.  I think its time for
an alarm, a 12volt conversion, and video surveilance.   ARRRGH
