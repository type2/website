Subject: Many Topics, My mini digest

1. With Kabayo on the list now, Eric and Barb don't have much of a chance to
check
in,  miss them and hope they can make KP
2. Paint them as you like them, who cares about original as long as YOU are
happy
3. Put repo empi 5 spokes on my 61 crewcab, no problems, had to grind the
inside hub to clear dust cap on a 66 deluxe I had
4. The guy I sold the 61 westy hatch top to ( for $650.00 ) is redoing the
complete original all wood ( no formica or whatever) interior and said he
would make patterns/copies for a price( basicly his cost) it people were
interested. He is a great woodworker and the new pieces will match exact,
won't be cheap, you get what you pay for. He gets the digest so maybe he
will email back or I can forward to him.
5. Where is ARIDzona? and what is VWonderfull?
6. Sorry Joe and Kyle, but I can't make it to Corona de Tucson in Arizona
this weekend, but will be at Bug-O-Rama April 1st. Have a great caravan,
will think of all the ABCers while finishing the 63 and working ( on call)
this weekend. Will save a Beast for each of you.
7. Mark, are you coming to LHC for spring break, lots of females here,
 copper canyon and the sandbar) email me, to bad I'm happily married
8. Seems like there are getting to be alot of bus clubs out there, must be
some unhappy clubers
9. Strictly Vintage II's is a great family club like ABC and I wish them
luck as they expand to Nor Cal
10. Have 1 large BBB4 t-shirt left, $15.00 includes priority mail to you,
1st email to me gets it
11. Will the correct people out there be pissed if I put 14' bus wheels on
my 63? or will anyone even notice or care?
12. Bus is back from the body shop. Had to have them repaint the complete
front and the door frames. One of the benefits of paying someone to do your
body work and paint, but if still feels funny having someone mess with your
bus. I think this will be the first and last time I sub out the body and
paint work.
13. Have 3 sets of camper windows for sale,  all are the single glass type,
top hinge ( no westy ones) will have them at Phoenix and Kelly Park, if not
sold before. Will only sell in person. To many ??? and stuff trying to
describe over the net, no way to send pictures, pissed people if they think
items described wrong, ect
