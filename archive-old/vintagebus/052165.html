Subject: Re: [VB] Safari Windows

On yours, the wiper blades simply fit over the half-moon
part when you want wipers, and you tilt them back and fold
them over when you don't want wipers.

&gt; Can anyone tell me how the wiper engagers/disengagers fit/work for a set
&gt; of Safari Windows.  It's pretty obvious that the wiper shafts fit into
&gt; the holes in the piece, and then secured by the set screw, but then
&gt; what?  These adapters have a rotating shaft on one end, and a metal post
&gt; with a half-moon cut-out on the other end.
