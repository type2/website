Hi Volks,

Would anyone be willing to make some patterns for me of the door panels,
kick panels and possibly the roof panels?  I want to redo the interior of
Sparky ('60 Panel) and being the poor teacher that I am do not want to fork
out the bucks, if there is a possibility of doing it myself.  Anyone have
any tips for me?

By the way, Thanksgiving break is here and I will finally get to work on
the Bus Podium for my classroom.  I can't wait to get the flashing lights
and a VW horn in the classroom ;0)

Thanks
Joy thru air,

Jamie
