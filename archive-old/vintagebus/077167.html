Subject: Re: [VB] battery explosion and clutch cable breaks

&gt; I had a battery explode today.  Here's how it
&gt; happened.  First, the clutch cable broke.  I check the
&gt; spares box and no spare cable.  I'm about 5 miles from
&gt; my house so I decide to try to get home by starting
&gt; the engine in first gear,  sync the shifting and nurse

done starting in first on the starter before with no problem.
only time ive had a battery blow out was when it was overcharging due to a
bad regulator.
