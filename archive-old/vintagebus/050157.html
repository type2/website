Subject: Re: Brakes Pulling Hard to Right [Summary]


I wrote yesterday about my bus that was pulling hard to the right when
braking. Thanks for all the help on this, I must have gotten over a dozen
replies.

Many people said it probably wasn't the master cylinder as I had guessed,
instead it was probably the soft brake line on the left side expanding
under pressure. This seemed to fit the symptoms better than any other
hypothesis except that the soft lines in the bus are nearly new, they have
no cracks and the metal parts are still shiny. On visual inspection the
line did not baloon no matter how hard my wife leaned on the brake pedal.

Other people thought it was a blown wheel cylinder or a cylinder sticking
in the bore. I hadn't mentioned it but I replaced the wheel cylinders on
that side about a month ago, they are new.

But I did that brake job by the solaric light of a dimestore flashlight
held by a nine-year-old, so maybe I got dirt in it or something. Other
people expected it was a blockage of some sort too.

So today I took everything apart, and scrupulously cleaned everything
downstream of the hard line, and blew everything out. Couldn't find
anything obviously wrong. The soft line looked just perfect but Roy Rogers
has them behind the counter for $10 so I replaced it just to say I had. The
wheel cylinders are perfect and the shoes are brand new. I have lots of
hydraulic pressure at the hard line, everything should work great if the MC
is good.

Put it back together, take it around the block, it still pulls to the
right. The right front wheel will lock up at the slightest provocation.

Well, Craig Sauls says the contamination may be on the GOOD side, which is
counterintuitive but he is a machinist by trade and one of two people in
the world who has built a reliable 2180 so I listen to him 8). I have all
the parts to rebuild the right side already in a box in the shed and I'm
already dirty so let's renew the right side and see what happens:

The lower wheel cylinder is wet with brake fluid but no obvious drips and
the shoes seem dry. Take it all apart, scrub the backing plate with orange
hand cleaner and a toothbrush, blow everything out, clean everything off,
new cylinders and shoes, set the bearings, adjust-bleed-adjust. Once you do
this three times in two days you get pretty efficient at it.

That fixed it, now it stops ===perfectly=== straight.

Maybe the leaking brake fluid in small amounts makes things sticky, like
your teeth feel when you eat spinach. I dunno. I still don't know exactly
what was wrong with the damn thing but it's fixed now, thanks once again to
the almighty list, thanks everybody!
