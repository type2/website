Hello all,  anyone in the Tamp Fl area that is interested in a 1967 microbus 
deluxe, I have a great one.  My name is Mark Pilarczyk and my name is in Hot 
VW's april addition for the Florida bug Jam that happened back in november. 
I won 1st place in the &quot;under construction&quot; catagory, so you know the bus is 
in great shape.  Currently my bus is done, as far as I am concerned.  It 
just got a new paint job and it runs great. I have 6,500 invested into the 
bus along with all the paper work to prove it.  I am asking just to break 
even because I bought the bus and did the work out of pure love for my bus.  
Now I am getting ready to go to college in Tallahasee and my parents aren't 
letting me take the bus.  Anyways,  if anyone is interested,  my name is 
mark and I will send you a pic of my bus as soon as I get them developed if 
you are interested.

thanks a bunch
67 deluxe 6,500.00 $$$$$

peace out      mark pilarczyk
