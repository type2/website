Look in the phone book and see if there's someone nearby that does
powder coating.  It comes in clear as well.

&gt; Hey!
&gt; 
&gt;I ordered another emblem from Kustom1 for $80 and it arrived today. Before I install, I would like to protect this emblem so this problem doesn't occur again.  I thought about using a high-gloss clear coat, but I'm worried that this might ruin the emblem's sheen or peel off???
