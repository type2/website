&gt; Hi David,
&gt; Sounds like the cheapo Dansk heater boxes.  Did they have fins inside of the 
&gt; exaust tubes?  If not then they are the cheapo ones, and will cause the 
&gt; engine to run hotter especially during warmer weather!   Eric&amp;Barb

OK, I have to know.  Why do these heater boxes cause engines to run
warmer?  Less restriction to the flow of air from the fan shroud?  I'd
think that the smallest passage when the heat is off is the outlet of the
bypass of the flapper valve.
