Subject: WWII Nazi pin w/ kdf wagen
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

List,

I've been looking for some WWII trinkets, and someone
told me that there's a pin that has a little cog with
a kdf-wagen in front of the cog.  Does anyone have one
of these?  Does anyone have a picture or point me in
the right direction?  Just wondering what they look
like and how much they are going for.  

Bus content:  I am very interested in the seat belt
stuff, as I have a doublecab that I'm thinking about
putting 3 point seatbelt in for my kids.  It's killing
me to do it, but I don't want them to get hurt because
they like to ride in &quot;daddy's bus truck.&quot;  I think the
orginal lap belts do fine in the front, but if done
correctly, I may even consider putting the 3 pointers
there too.

Also, how's the repop fiberglass pedal housing cover
coming?  I haven't seen any traffic on the subject for
a few days.  If it is done, count me in for two!

Paul
