After the repop pop-out frame disappointment I decided to roll up my shirt sleeves and attack my stack of pop-out frames.  As of this morning I've separated 20 frames!!!  And I only needed 2.  Numerous had lass.  I finally developed a great routine that works pretty well.

1. Give the screw area a good soaking with Liquid wrench or Kroil, or anyother rust neutralizer.  maybe even let them soak overnight, but not critical.

2.  First strip the head of the screw as much as you can by trying to remove the screw with a screw driver.  I know this sounds crazy but stay with me.  By doing this you can now take a center punch and set a hole in the middle of the screw head.

3. Now use a 3/32&quot; drill bit and drill down into the screw approx. 1/8&quot; or slightly more.  Then use an easy out and small cresent wrench to remove the screw.  Often times the screw head will break off leaving portions of the screw shaft in the hole.  The key is getting the screw head off, don't worry about leaving some screw in the hole.  This is can be beneficial when retapping the hole, if you have to.

4. Once all four screw or screw heads are off, the upper joint, which is normally rust free, should come apart easily.  Take a flathead screwdriver and carefully pry the lower joint apart.  Maybe juice it a little more with Liquid Wrench.

5.  Once apart inspect all holes and determine which if any need to be retapped.

I've gotten it down to where I can get a frame apart in approx. 10 to 15 minutes.  The key is patience and starting the drill hole in as close to the center of the screw head as possible.  Also drilling perpindicular to the frame (straight down the center of the screw) is key as well.

Hope this helps.  I'm going to then sandblast the ends, primer or POR 15 and have ready to paint. Who needs frames??????
