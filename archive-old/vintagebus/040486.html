Does anyone know off hand if the rear seats from  a 68-71 (or even newer for 
that matter) bay window bus will fit into the rear passenger area of my 67 
bus. I suppose I could measure myself but I wanted to see if anyone on the 
list has ever had success with trying this. Seats seem to be getting pretty 
scarce!
