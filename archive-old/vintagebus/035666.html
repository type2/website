&lt;&lt; The original owner of this bus died in '59 and the bus sat in a dirt 
floored barn until '99. &gt;&gt;  SNIP  &lt;&lt; I have an internal engine noise ( a 
chattering/high pitched rattle) that I did NOT have before that last drive 
when I got her pretty overheated.&gt;&gt;

If the engine was not properly prepared by the owner for storage before he 
died and if iut was not kept up during the storage the engine is suspect and 
should be dissassembled and inspected.  When we bought our 1963 SC back in 
1986 it had sat for eight years just after having a complete engine rebuild.  
One of the long 40HP early rocker studs had pulled out of one of the heads 
causing a HP loss that the owner just gave up and parked it.  Once I got the 
engine running it ate it's bearings about 50 miles later due to the rust on 
the crank.  The oil in it during the eight years sitting was dirty, acidic, 
and had water in it!
The other problem is that the supercharger will allow the engine to RPM much 
higher than the normal 36 HP stock engine which has the restriction due to 
the small intake manifold.  The higher the RPM the more heat has to be 
dissipated per minute out of the head/cylinder fins.  Which is another reason 
VOA did not allow thier dealerships to install Judsons and if the owners did 
the warrenty on the VW was void!
   As for the high pitched internal noise it sounds like it might be a broken 
piston ring.    Eric&amp;Barb
