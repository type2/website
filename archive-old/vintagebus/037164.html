Subject: Re:  [VB] Round outside mirrors and arms??
To: jiminwis_at_yahoo_dot_com, vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

the repro arms are slightly differently shaped that the original, both the 
drivers and passengers.  Unless you are really familar with the orginal arms, 
or have one right there, it is kind of hard to kno wthis.  If you dont like 
they shiny, paint them.

I have one on my 65 westy, thinnk that I had to get a nut for it as it did 
not come with one.  That was the only problem.  Do use grease or anti seize 
when installing.

Yes I have relplaced the mirror in round mirrors.  Back in the old days 
before the repros were available I would collect round mirrors with broen or 
figged glass.   ow they are $20 or a bit less, pretty cheap.  The originals 
had gone up to $80 before the repros came out.    I had some mirror glass cut 
into circles using an uncracked but fogged round mirror glass as a pattern.   
  You can get mirror cut round at a glass shop.
