Subject: Re: [VB] Won't start with new carb.

7 is the electromagnetic cutoff valve, the Bus won't start unless you give
it power, just wire it in with the choke.

Yes, it takes a little bit of cranking to fill an empty carb., but not that
much, maybe 4-5 seconds?  I usually crank it a bit with the coil wire off,
then let it sit for a minute, reconnect the coil, and fire it up.

&gt; I just ran my battery down trying to start my 67
&gt; deluxe. I had pulled the engine to fix the tranny.
&gt; While the engine was out, I replaced the original 30
&gt; PICT Solex with a new Brosol 30/31 PICT replacement.

&gt;
&gt; I hooked my lines up 1 2 3 as described above, then
&gt; 4,5,6 are the three other unused inlets. 7 is the
&gt; other electrical connection.
