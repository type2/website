Regarding swamp coolers on splitty buses--all the swampers i have seen
are made for the conventional roll -up windows as on the 68 and later
buses. But i'm sure if you really wanted to install one--they could be
retreo fitted--Here in Phoenix a friend of mine has installed a full
size House Swamp Cooler in his late model bus--With recirculating
water!!
Now thats taking it to the extreem--but bus people can do that--On
occasion i do have a cooler or two on hand--They DO work!! and there is
never a load on the motor or electrical system. I have also seen the new
swampers made of fiberglass--and a real cool early one that fits under
the dash--that was installed in a Street Rod.--now that's KUEL!!
