&lt;&lt; The issue of the day... what are opinions on this?  Should my &quot;distributing
 old messages&quot; be limited to &quot;one at a time via a web site&quot; or should I make
 copies of them in bulk (CD-ROM or ZIP file for download) to whomever asks? &gt;&gt;

if you're not selling the CD ROM's for profit then seriously, who cares.  I 
dont think anyone that posts to the list really cares if their posts are 
included in something like that.  I think most of us all realize that we are 
a part of the archive and that it is entirely possible that some non list 
member may search us or a post we made out.

On the other hand, it might be nice if you were to strip out email addresses 
and only allow people to search by topic and not use the archives to collect 
email addresses.  Or maybe if you stripped out the addresses, but left the 
poster's name?  I'm not up to speed on that kind of stuff, but something to 
consider
