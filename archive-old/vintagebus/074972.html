Subject: RE: [VB] For Kadron users 

  We dynoed them on one of the 1800's I build. They are the same carbs as
those that came on a 72 or so bus. We changed the venturis to a larger along
with the mains, pilots and air correction. Very good throttle response and
good gas mileage. I have built 1 more with the same set up and am doing the
third and 4th now. The Solexs made more power then Kadrons even though we
had a restrictive muffler on the Solex engine
  I have 3 other customers who have switched from ICT's (couldn't keep them
synced) and Kadrons (just plain worn out) and love them.
  CB has kits for type 1 and type 4 engines

ronnie

ps. I will post the dyno results from the different carbs when I get back

I was always wondering why somebody didn't use the garden-variety Solex
carbs in a dual carb setup.  They always used something different and
exotic.  Glad to see that someone has come to their senses.

Ronnie, what sort of engine are they running this setup on?
