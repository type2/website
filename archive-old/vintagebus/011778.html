&gt; Glen is mostly completely right, but the early 2 speed 6 volt wiper

&gt; I know this doesn't help, but VW trivia is an important part of the list
&gt; content, right?
++++++
like all threads - important to some, irrelevant to others - as for me -
seeing as i'm heading into winter and the summers seen nowt but rain - I'M
interested! any vw trivia, feeds ideas into my soggy head.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; endlessly irritaded - by wipers that never run at the right speed.
they run
&gt; &gt; &gt; like sloaths when cold then gradually warm up to a speed that misses
the
&gt; &gt; &gt; glass.
&gt; The dropping resistor might be changing resistance as it warms up...

it sure is!
&gt; 
&gt; You could get a 2 speed switch and run through your 6V drop on slow
&gt; speed and 9V drop on high. That way you would only have to run on 9V in
&gt; torrential downpours and go easy on the motor the rest of the time.

+++
now you see....... this is something i hadn't thought about..... - if i use
a 2 speed switch, keep the variable drop kit, wire it up as is to position
one, but make up a new loop to attach higher up the drop (say at 9 volt) to
position 2 - then eureeka - 2 speeds!  :)
&gt; 
&gt; BTW: All you folks talking about your Busses has me _extremely_ jealous,
&gt; as I don't have one on the road right now! Damn work and homeowner
&gt; responsibilities are cutting into my Bus building time. I WANNA DRIVE A
&gt; SPLIT! 

+++
Paul, if there wasn't a hell of a puddle between us, i'd let you drive one
of mine! 


Whew... got that out of my system... sorry for dumping a personal
&gt; problem on y'all.

+++
lie back, relax, shut your eyes an let it all out...

&lt;just slipping out for a cup of tea&gt;

see ya!

Glynn
btw, Thanx!
