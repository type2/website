Subject: RE: [VB] Spedo broke ?

Yup, thanks Clara, did all that except remove the offending device. The old
cable spun ok also, but the square end of it that passed through the grease
cap was rounded off, that's why I decided to replace it anyway. I disconnected
the new cable from the back of the spedo when I found that it was turning, but
not the spedo, and I didn't want the frozen spedoto bind the cable and stip
out the repaired grease cape square hole.

So..... where to get another spedo? I am not a stock part neophyte like David
or some the other guys, just want some indication that my truck is moving. Is
there people out there that repair these things? That might also be an
option.

&lt;&lt; Well, the spedo is definately not responding. All I get is clicks out of
it. The cable end in the grease cape is taken care of and is turning ok but
the spedo is doing nothing.

I would check the connection under the speedo.  Then remove the left axle cap
, and spin the cable by hand.   I can do this fast enough for the speedo to
respond.  it's a funny angle to hold thecable in one hand and see the speedo,
but it can be done.   If all the speedo does is click, yup it's an unhappy
camper.

next step, remove speedo from bus, labeling wires/dash light plugs.  undo
speedo cable.   you don't have to completely remove teh two screw that hold
the speedo in, just loosen both enough, and you can rotate the speedo and
remove it.

then spin thingy in speedo and double check it's toast

install replacement speedo.  now you get to choose whether to install it
upside down or not.  and I'd replace any faded plastics for the lights.  Your
choice of colours!!!
