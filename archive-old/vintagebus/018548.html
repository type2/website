Subject: Preheat tube connection
Mime-Version: 1.0
X-MIME-Autoconverted: from quoted-printable to 8bit by lenti.type2_dot_com id KAA56538

As someone who knows a lot of useless theory but not a lot about busses, I
have an easy question:

What does the preheat tube connect to?  Is it a &quot;J&quot; shaped thing right under
the tin?  If so, how does it bolt onto the car?

Another question - is the rear (FOF) tin for a '66 shared with beetles, i.e.
is the preheat hose hole on the right side as in the beetle (if it IS there on
the beetle)?

I suppose I could get the bently, and I will.  Presently, however, my bus is
in Florida and I'm in Virginia.  I'm trying to round up the rest of the parts
to make it correct during the time I have it in storage.

Any help will be appreciated!!
