&lt;&lt; I would like to go to a tire taller, but not wider than the 165 R 15's. 
This is on the 63 double cab.  I saw one at the Springfield show with 205's. 
Too wide, couldn't get your finger between the tire &amp; the wheel well. &gt;&gt;
Hi Bigdog,
205/75R15 (about 26.75 Dia.) will work just fine on 1955-67 buses!  Maybe 
what you saw had rim to drum adapters pushing the tires outward.  If your DC 
is a 1963 with the higher and wider rear wheel wells than the 1955-62 buses 
then you can even mount 235/75R15 (29&quot; Dia.) which we have installed in our 
1963 SC without problems with the rear fender well.  The only problem we had 
with this huge tire was light rubbing on the RGB spring plate lower stop when 
jacked up to adjust brakes which we cured with a tiny amount of grinding of 
the stops where it hit the tire.
