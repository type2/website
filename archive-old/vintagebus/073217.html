Only if you want to improve your blue vocabulary!

If you get one, get a cheap model from Radio Shack.  Expensive ones are
not much better than the cheap ones.  Get a mag mount antenna and you're
good to go.

Truckers can be amusing to listen to and they're even helpful if you catch
them in the right mood.

I greatly prefer ham radio, but it's a bit late for you to study for a
license.  FRS is best for group trips.
