&gt; &gt;I thought that the &quot;M-code&quot; plate was located behind the driver's seat...
&gt; &gt;looked and saw none.  saw no paint marks, tho that would have indicated

&gt; 
&gt; Look harder - it hsould be there.

Then try lookng behind the passenger seat.;)

&gt; &gt;I don't think this is the deluxe interior... bed/seat in the back and
&gt; &gt;seat/cooler cabinet behind the divider with a flip up table between.
&gt; &gt;&quot;Spice rack&quot; on the rear double door, tho.  What is it?  SO-wise?
&gt; 
&gt; 67-only SO-L
&gt; 

Awcomeon!!;p  sounds like a generic so-42 interior to me.;)
