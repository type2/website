Subject: Re: [VB] Clutch pedal removal

----- Original Message ----- &gt;    Does anyone have a trick to push out the
pivot?  I think I might need to make a special tool to get the leverage I
need to push the pivot out.  There's no room for a drift and hammer.
&gt;
&gt;    Any help would be appreciated.
&gt;
I just applied side pressure with my arm while moving the pedal lever back
and forth. It eventually came out.
