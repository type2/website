&gt; That was Marantz,(the crazy).  Craig made a 4 track player that mounted
&gt; below the dash about the same time.  Each tape held a album, 8 to 10 tunes,

I remember my first car deck back in the land of 1969 was a Lear, or
Learjet 4+4.  It played 8tracks or 4 tracks.  When a 4 track was inserted
the pinch roller would pop up into place, with 8 track it didn't.
