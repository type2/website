Subject: Re: [VB] VIN numbers

2222164407

222  it's a type 2, model 2 ( or 22= standard) and made in '2, or 72. 
 the first 3 digits are the same codes as the splittys.

...2164407 - this is the serial part of the VIN- they use 7 digits as of 68 
instead of 6 for 65-67.    

if the vin is 235 xxx xxx, it's a '65 kombi.
if the vin is 235 xxx xxxx, it's a 75 kombi.

Think this is all in the back of the Idiot book.

FWIW, a 72 has the last of the rounded bumpers rather than those with the 
ridge pressed in, last year the turn sigs in the front are low, and the first 
year of the large rectangular taillights.
