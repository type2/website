Subject: Corner Windows/cargo floors

    Just cleared customs.  For those of you with rusted out corner window
frames or those of you that want to add corner windows, the parts are here
(well at least one side). We now have the metal frames for corner windows,
direct from Brazil.
For some reason only one side showed up, but the other is in the next
container, along with BRAND NEW corner window GLASS. The frames will be
around $75.00 dollars a pair. I will have pricing for the glass and seals in
a few days.
   Also in the same container we got complete cargo floors, these are
Brazilian repo's and should be selling for around $150.00 
for the complete floor!!! or even less.
   One day I'll get the web site updated with all the new items we are
recieving weekly. If you don't see it call and ask. We more then likely have
it or will tell you who does.
