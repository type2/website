Oh man, get me two of these now!! I'll be interested.
Sure sounds good and should not have problems for the next 50-60K miles or
so.

&gt; Speaking of this, I have been offered a really good deal on some new _dual
&gt; port_ 1600cc heads from a supplier in Europe.  These are unique because
they
&gt; take a bare VW/Brazil head and assemble it with all new German TRW valves,
&gt; etc.  They build them this way because the quality is better than the 100%
&gt; Brazilian ones (which is normally all you can get).  This is as close to a
&gt; brand new German head as you can get.
&gt;
&gt; Projected price is $99 each plus shipping, give or take a few bucks. The
&gt; only reason the price is so low is that they are overstocked so they are
&gt; giving me a quantity at their cost. Can I get a show of hands as to how
many
&gt; people would be interested?  I need to make a decision within a day or so,
&gt; although delivery from Europe would take about 6-8 weeks.  If you want to
&gt; reserve a pair, let me know; you will not be billed until they ship.
