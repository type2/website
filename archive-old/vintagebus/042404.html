&gt; In 1963, VW offered the M216 option. Buses with this option were equiped
&gt; with slightly bigger rear drums and longer stub axles.  The gear reduction
&gt; was a different ratio than the regular non-M216 models.
&gt; 
&gt; These M216 Buses normally came with a 1500cc engine.  If you find a pair of
&gt; those rear drums, grab them. They are very very rare.

so regular 63 trannies are the same as 61 and earlier, thas really cool to
know thanks :)

Why do they take a different mount then, i have noticed that the mounts
sold are all 63 and newer or 62-60 (splitcase is different)

thanks,

Steve
