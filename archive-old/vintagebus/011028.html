1963 panel, walk through, single side cargo doors. 1500cc motor, LOTS of extra
parts, been sitting for awhile, has some florida drip rail rust and needs the
bottom of nose pulled out and some corner work among other things. It is a
driver/project. 1000.00 call and ask for Jason 941 758 6437, I went and looked
at it today and passed, but maybe this is your baby? Maybe you can save it?
