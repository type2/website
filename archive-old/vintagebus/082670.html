&gt; My bus, 1 062 827 with a production date of 31 January 1963 has the

It sounds like this light may have been standard with the US-spec hazard
flashers.  The US-spec hazard light system is only mentioned in the
'63-'67 Bentley, but seems to have been available before the '63 model
year.

&gt; What is this DOLIWA that was referred to several times? I assume it's
&gt; a production list or progressive refinements for the bus?

Yep.  It lists changes by chassis number, like Progressive Refinements,
but mortals can actually get one.  It's so OG, it's in G.  I have had
more than one person tell me that there is an English version but I
have never found it.  It may just use the same VW publicity photo on
the front (white Vanagon, silver bay-window, 1949 split-window prototype)
as some other Bus book.

It helps if you understand some German, but with a background in Buses
and the online translators you can figure it out.  It has chapters (two
to four pages each) for each year from 1949 to 1990, with a short article
and pictures in each chapter.

One thing you have to watch out for is that the &quot;overview&quot; charts in the
back are for the German Buses, so for example it shows the 1600 available
in a Bus all the way through '81.  It also has M-code lists for split-
window Buses, bay-window Buses, and Vanagons.

http://www.amazon_dot_de/exec/obidos/ASIN/3613020246/ says it is EUR 26,00
or about US $35.  Shipping to the US is 9-12 working days and costs
another EUR 15,50 or about US $21, for about US$56 all told.  There may
be customs on top of this; I don't know.

There is a similar book in English: &quot;VW Transporter and Microbus
Specification Guide 1950-1967&quot; by David Eccles.  Amazon doesn't stock it
directly but has links to purchase it new in hardback for about US $30:
http://www.amazon_dot_com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/1861265093/ .  The site
announcing the book
http://www.btinternet_dot_com/~dace.ecc/ordering_information.htm has links
to British distributors Crowood Press and VW Books.  Crowood offers a
hardback http://www.crowoodpress.co_dot_uk/2004/book_details.asp?ISBN=1+86126+509+3
at GBP 15.96 and a paperback
http://www.crowoodpress.co_dot_uk/2004/book_details.asp?ISBN=1+86126+652+9
at GBP 11.96.  Surface mail (== slow) shipping is GBP 5.50 for either
book, bringing the total to about US $42 or $34.  VW Books has the
paperback http://www.vwbooks.co_dot_uk/catalogue/covers/vwb1040.htm for
GBP 14.95 or about US $29.  They don't have a fixed shipping charge,
but do offer air mail (== fast).

If you're a true Bus nut, you might want both, as each one seems to have
changes that are not in the other.  I did a comparison of the changes
listed for 1964: http://www.type2_dot_com/archive/vintagebus/063401.html .
