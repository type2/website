Hi Rob,
Before we drove my Dc down to BBBV last year the engine was of &quot;unknown
origin&quot; out of a 68 bug I'd bought. Kate and I had driven in it to Boise,
ID. for the Bus Pilots show, to Washington for The Gorge campout, to Utah
for the swap meet in Ogden at The Bug House, and I used it for a daily
driver and a work truck putting on about 1000 miles a week with my 108 mile
one way commute to work and then ran a service route with it. Now the engine
is currently out and I did overheat it carrying 1400 lbs of salt over a very
steep grade in 80 deg. weather but it still ran when I pulled it with very
worn rings and cracked heads. I was very careful to adjust the valves
frequently and changed the oil 3000 miles on the nose. As it's been said you
will be able to hear your bus's engine note and become more &quot;in tune&quot; with
it the more you drive it.
 By the way, you saw which gauges I had in the DC, only a volt gauge to keep
track of the generator.
