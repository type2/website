Checked the archives for comments on pulling the steering whell and found 
one by Jaime Chriswisser: soak the H#_at_l out of it with penetrating oil and 
pull with all your strength while someone else hits the column shaft taking 
care to protect the wheel and the shaft threads (edited to shorten it up).  
He says it works but wondering if anyone would like to add anything to this 
or a different/enhanced technique?
