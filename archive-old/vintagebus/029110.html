Subject: DPO's and foam insulation

OK, I can put up with things like putting in a DP motor adding coat
hooks and the God awful wood paneling inside the cabin by the previous
owner.  The thing I'd like to kill the PO for is stuffing absolutely
every nook and cranny of this double cab full of that expanding foam
insulation!   It took me almost two hours of hacking and scraping to get
just one door clean.  Thank God that this truck sat in the dry South
West.  The rust was just starting to form at the bottom of the doors and
its only surface rust.  I've POR 15'd it to halt its spread.

Does anyone have any tips to easily get this stuff out?  Anything that
dissolves this stuff, or am I stuck hacking it out a piece at a time?


Steve
