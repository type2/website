Subject: RE: [VB] Forged or not

Great point George.  Very true and I agree.

But (there always has to be a but) since the the standard lightened flywheel 
is 12.5 lbs I am pretty much stuck with that option.

I guess a custom flywheel could be ground but the math calculation would be 
almost impossible (for me at least).  Also factor in if running a stroker 
crank the weight shifts outward that much more making for even more complex 
math.

For me I think the lightened flywheel is the way to go on a C/W crank.  
Especially a stroker.  Maybe with a 69 C/W add a Berg Equalizer, stroker 
keeps the stock pulley.

On this subject a big YMMV applies ;)

Thanks,
Adrian

&gt;In short, you have to remove only 1/4 the mass from the flywheel as you
&gt;added to the crank, since the flywheel has a large radius.
