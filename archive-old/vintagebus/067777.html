&gt; Anyway, this weekend i'm going to install new spindles, link pins, tie rod 
&gt; assemblies and possible change the torsion arm seals. The bentley looks 
&gt; pretty straight forward but I am a little confused about the shim/degree 
&gt; measurement thing. What do I need to do all of this? 

Hi Sean,
Check out the &quot;Idiots Guide&quot; for how to do it on a bug to get a good grasp on 
how to simply do it.  This is one of a few areas of info where this manual 
just about surpasses the Bentley reprint of the original 1963-67 VW bus shop 
manual.
