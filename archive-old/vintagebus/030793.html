Hi Adrian,

I was having the same problems with my turnsignals, the right one wouldn't
work.  I checked all of the wiring and all of the connections, ran ground wires
for the tail light assemblies, and took the turn signal assembly apart and blew
air through it.  Nothing helped.  Finally my buddy pulled out his can of carb
cleaner, sprayed a whole bunch of junk out of there, let it dry, sprayed some
liquid wrench in there followed by compressed air, and that was a year ago and
everything has worked ever since.  Don't know if helps, but I thought I would
share.

&gt; I thought I fixed mine my resoldering the contacts, but that fix was short
&gt; lived and the left turn signal never worked anyway.  Astrogeek reports the
&gt; same problem, that these old units are just too old and fragile to hang on
&gt; anymore.
