&gt;     My buddy's ignition switch died and needs to be replaced.  He's got a
&gt; '67 bus and the catalogs list switches from '55-'66 only.  Is the '67
&gt; *physically* a different beast all together from the other ones??  Would a
&gt; '55-'66 switch fit the same??  Anyone?? Anyone??  TIA

67 is one-year-only because of the L code key. 64-66 is T code. The ignition
switch part is the same.
Does his door key match his ignition? If he found a L code switch, Gab could
recode it to match the doors.
If he finds a T code ignition, I have a L code one in my 66 Deluxe that I
would trade for the T code.
