Subject: BASTARD 40HP heads wanted
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

Looking for a set or just one head for a bastard 40hp
bus.  These look like a regular 40HP head but with a
strange small block off plate bolted just under the
intake manifold hole on the head.  I NEED one but
would buy two if they are nice.  No cracks or majorly
broken fins please.

Thanks
