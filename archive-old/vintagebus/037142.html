&gt; &lt;&lt;  If you
&gt;  &gt;have a bus that came with a tunnel case you don't the nose cone is the
&gt;  &gt;same. &gt;&gt;
&gt; Don't the mid 59 to 63 front tranny mounts have slightly smaller studs? Would 
&gt; this cause the tranny to slip up and down a bit during hard driving/shifting, 
&gt;  or would tighting the bolts down hold it in place? 

good point about the holes for where the nose cone goes to the front tranny mount.  I was only thinking about how the nose cone bolts to the tranny and to the bus, as a splitcase tranny has a different configuration.  However, it is not to be assumed that the nose cone is original to the bus.   If a 64-67 nose cone with the bigger holes for the mounts studs are installed, use that mount, which is more available.  The mounts are the same except for the size of the studs where it bolts to the nose cone, as the nose cone has differnt size holes.

Yes, it is best to have the correct mount for your nosecone, to minimize things shaking around.
