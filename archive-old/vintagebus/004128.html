Subject: gear reduction box to spring plate bolts

Ive been slowly going over my bus in recent days. looking for problems=20
that could haunt me down the road. I am planning an 1800+mile journey
this october and I would prefer for it to go smoothly. Whilst inspecting
the underside of the engine today, I noticed that my driver side gear
reduction box to spring plate had only 2 of 3 bolts in it. It appears
the bolt has broken off inside the box. On the other side however, much
to my surprise, only the top one of the 3 bolts was attached to the=20
spring plate and the box is sitting a little off kilter. I think the=20
bolts are 19mm. Where would I go about aquiring suitable replacements?
