I had the tv on Mtv2 today and noticed one of the Vjays was doing his thing,
announcing what was on, and what is coming on, and there it was...   A
Splitty bus. Completely in bare metal. Bare bumpers and all.  Anyone know
who's it is? Looks like a project.

Just wondering,

Sorry for the bandwith, but if anyone is out there right now, you can tune
it on and see it for yourself.
