Hi all,

As the topic suggests, this question is not in the deadly serious category.
Bear that in mind when you respond : - )

I met a guy yesterday who runs an outrageous Golf 2 GTI. It has all the
suspension and engine(oetinger) tweaks that anyone with more money than the
sense to buy a 944 turbo could ask for.

One of the gadgets is what he described as an 'electric supercharger'. The
concept looked pretty simple. It consisted of some sort of spacey looking
steel fan housing plumbed into the air inlet where the air cleaner would
normally go. The air cleaner was a special one that fitted between the 'fan'
and inlet manifold/throttle body.

He claimed that the installation of this device had resuled in a noticeable
increase in power delivery(it has not yet been dyno'd though). He also
explained that when it was switched off normal low pressure airflow was
resumed through some kind of bypass arrangement. 

Now for the question. Is this something like that kooky 'hydroboost' thing
where the electrical energy needed to convert water to hydrogen and oxygen
exceeds the extra engine  power output gained by plumbing the gas into the
inlet?

OR

Does it sound like there might be something to it?

It would be nice to flip a switch and cruise up those steep hills like a
freight train. 

Later 

Michael
