&gt; &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt;And on a side note, is the rear apron on a '58 supposed to have the
&gt; cutout for a tailpipe on the left side. I ask because BFY told me that
when I
&gt; bought their muffler, it was the only 36 hp type 2 muffler there is and
the pipe comes out the right side.&gt;&gt;
&gt;
Actually, there are repro 36hp exhausts that come out the left side.  They
are bad repros.  Bad repro, shame on you.

The 36hp exhaust tips can be found on eBay every week.

I'm assuming the rear apron should have no cutout as the tip is bent to go
under the apron.
