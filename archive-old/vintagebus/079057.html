Subject: VIN location question

Real quick question. I know it is on the website, but not much time to surf 
today, work needs to be done at work...LOL
I know the location of the VIN, but what series of numbers are the actual 
VIN?
I have a 67 deluxe.
If someone wants to email me off list, I can give you all the series of 
numbers so I can pinpoint the numbers so when the police verifiy it, I can 
tell them what numbers are the VIN and not the additional numbers for paint, 
etc.
Thanks in Advance.
