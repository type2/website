Subject: flywheel end play

Ok, so I'm moving right along.  Got most of the motor together.  Put
flywheel on pins.  Yep.  Tighten gland nut.  Yep.  Put funny little tool
with 10mm wrench and all-thread and nuts in one of the case holes, a la
Muir.  So here's the problem.  As I understand it, the 3 shims should be two
.24mm ones, plus another one of the .30-.36 variety.  But the way I see it,
I can only get the two .24mm ones to fit along with the appropriate feeler
gauge when I push on the flywheel.  (ya, I hammered on it, tried several
times, and all that)  So, do I just install the two shims and leave it at
that, or does this indicate a problem???
thanks in advance,
Diana
