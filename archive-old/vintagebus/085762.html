Subject: Re: [T2] Refinishing Aluminum Wheels

If you are near Portland, Oregon I could send you to a company that does excellent polishing that is worth the money, they do fuel tanks for big trucks and anything else you might want, I used them for yacht parts, they work miracles with stainless.

I have done enough polishing myself to see that they are a very good deal, if you are interested I could track down the contact info.

One tip I have for lumpy things is to get the hard cotton buffing pads for a die grinder to go with the Mothers, this works for things that are the extreme opposite of flat, like an intake manifold for a V8.

&gt; Hey Volks- anyone have any advice on re-finishing aluminum wheels. The 
&gt; wheels are in good shape, except for an accumulation of caked on brake 
&gt; dust and discoloration under the wheel weights. As always, TIA Ted
