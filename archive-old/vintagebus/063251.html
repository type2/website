Hey Ronnie,
Just think though of all the time you'd save.  Drop that thing off at the
dealer for all the oil changes, and all your PM visits.  Sure it would
cost a lot of money, but hey you could rest easy knowing the job was done
RIGHT by FACTORY CERTIFIED TECHNICIANS who really care about YOUR
&quot;microbus&quot;.:)

New cars, who needs 'em.
