Hi Wilder,
We think the wording you are looking for here is less expensive or 
inexpensive.  Cheaper generally means to be of lesser quality!

 http://www.necanopy_dot_com/index.htm&gt;&gt;
Hmm, the comparable heavy duty size, and quality there is about $600-1,000.00!

&lt;&lt;http://www.tarps_dot_com/index.html  &gt;&gt;
The comparable size quality there while being $10.00 less, sounds like they 
have no end or side walls.
  Both unfortunitly you still have to pay shipping on unless you happen to 
live near them!
