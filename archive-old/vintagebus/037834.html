&gt;Divorce force to sale
&gt;
I'm wondering how a divorce would force a sale?  If I got divorced, I wouldn't sell my Bus, I'd cut my wife a check for her 50%.  Damn Gold Book says it's only worth $750, real shame.  :)

On another note, $1500 obo is possible, I've seen several $2-$3k Barndoor purchases in the past few years and I'm not even hooked in with the &quot;cool&quot; Bus people (as if) so I'm sure there's been a lot more.  None were Deluxes.
