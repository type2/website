The Observations of a Former Counterman.
Part 2: Selling the Right Part

Back in the early to mid 1990's, I worked at a very well known Volkswagen 
parts and accessories store in beautiful Southern California (I will 
withhold the name to protect the innocent).

When I first accepted the job, I thought I knew all there was to know about 
Volkswagens and the people that drove them.  The day I started I realized 
that things would be  much different than I had expected.

I had I assumed that everyone who walked into the store knew what they were 
driving, knew how to do their own repairs and would freely volunteer any 
information that might be necessary for me to know in order to provide the 
correct parts for their car. I soon found out how wrong I was.

I could not figure out what I was doing wrong. Why were so many people 
returning parts I had sold to them? How was it that I was selling them the 
wrong parts? I knew I was not perfect, but I had a very good knowledge of 
Volkswagens.

I soon realized that many of these returns were because I had been given 
incomplete or incorrect information by the customers. Often times, 
modifications had been made to the car or parts had been swapped from other 
years or models and I had not been told about it. I had assumed that 
everything would be stock on the car unless I was told differently. I knew 
enough when I started the job to ask the obvious questions (six or twelve 
volt, standard or super), but I soon learned that many more questions needed 
to be asked in order to sell the right part.

Soon I was interrogating people like Joe Friday. At least once a week I 
would discover more questions that needed to be asked. If a guy walked in 
looking for new felt channels for his doors I knew that I had to ask whether 
or not he had stock or one piece windows.  If a 1962 Bus owner strolled in 
looking for new rear brake shoes I knew that I needed to ask if it had a 
small nut or big nut tranny. This was especially important with mail order.

Sometimes these questions would stump the customer. One good example would 
be someone coming into the store to buy a new generator for a 1973 Bug. As 
most of us know, about halfway through the production year Volkswagen 
eliminated the old fashioned generator in favor of a much better alternator 
(about a decade after most other auto makers). The early Type 1 alternators 
had an external regulator. Later ones (1975 and newer and most replacements) 
featured an internal regulator.

So how many possibilities do we have here?
1) the car could be equipped with the original generator
2) the car could me equipped with the original alternator
3) the car could have been upgraded from the original generator OR 
alternator to and internally regulated alternator.

A very small percentage of the people would be able to answer these 
questions. At this point, it was time to climb out from behind the counter 
and look at the engine. If the car was not in the parking lot, then the 
customer would have to bring in the old part, a picture of the old part or 
at least describe it in detail.

I also learned that it was a good idea to print out the information given to 
me by the customer on the invoice. This was really to cover my backside in 
case the part was returned. The invoice would prove that I had not made a 
careless mistake (or sometimes it would be my downfall).

I worked with a great bunch of people at that VW parts store. We all got 
along very well and we all enjoyed helping the customers. The problem I see 
when I walk into many other VW parts stores (but not all) is that the guy 
working behind the counter does not ask the necessary questions when a 
customer asks for a part.  If someone walks into the store to buy a window 
rubber kit for a Bug, the counter guy needs to ask if the car is a 
convertible, if it has popout windows and if the customer wants Cal-look or 
original style rubber. More often than not, I see the counter guy disappear 
into the warehouse and re-emerge with a box of Bugpack Cal-look window 
rubber no matter what the customer really had in mind.

So what is the lesson here? Well, the customer is not always going to think 
of all of the information to give when buying parts. It is also the 
responsibility of the counterman to do a little probing. Doing so might take 
a little more time now, but it will save a lot of time later dealing with 
returns and unhappy customers.
