Was writ:

the ones on the 67 westy on E-bay are the real harp mirror arms.

-----

Just as a side note, I passed by my FLAPS the other day and they have repos
or these &quot;harp&quot; style mirror arms.

I forget who is doing the repo and the price, but I remember that it was
reasonable ($20?? or less)

If anyone wants details, pmail me and I can give them a call.
