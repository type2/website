The San Joaquin Valley caravan is a bit smaller. I didn't get the '63
doublecab finished, but have the sore muscles, torn hands and burnt out
brain to prove the effort. Unsurprisingly, the major problems were with
the non-stock stuff, CV joints, dual carbs, etc.
We'll ride with Karl and C.R. to be at the OCTO Saturday morning.
Travelodge on Katella is pretty close to the Pond, parking is near the
rooms and reasonable.

Travel alert, the Katella offramp from 5 is under major construction. I
only have the directons from Southbound 5 to the Pond. Take 95 east,
then 57 south. Take the Katella offramp, turn right.

I'm still going to buy a pint for the listee group at the JT Schmid
brewpub, close to the Pond. Come over about 1-2 p.m., we'll have our own
area. I'm planning on 20-30 listees, but the more the merrier. At the
meet I'll be at Craig's red/white doublecab, the guy with the name tags.
