I had this exact same symptom on my oval window years ago.  Started out only
making noise when started in the morning.  Then made noise every start.
Then made noise while driving.  And that was it.  When it finally lost power
it sounded like a bag of wrenches being shaken violently.  I never split it
to see what actually let go since I happened to be putting together a bigger
motor at the time.  Sounds like you're in the same boat.  I'd be interested
to find what let go in yours.
