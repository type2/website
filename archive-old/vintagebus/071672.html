Subject: Re: [VB] oil change - part two - should I worry?

&gt; hm, well If it was my engine I'd say, well it ran, so lets change that oil
&gt; and get new in.   Don't worry about the washer, it was there, now it's
not,
&gt; maybe it fell down the fill hole, who knows?

That was kinda my feeling as well.  It has ran well up to this point (and is
still running well)   You know the old saying &quot;don't fix it if it anit
broke&quot;  I have already changed the oil.  I will add some rislone and change
again tonight
&gt;
&gt; fwiw  dist drive washers are round, bigger than dimes, and can be replaced
&gt; w/o cracking the case.   I worry when I see a coppery sheen to the oil or
little
&gt; bits or stuff w/ copper that could be rod bearing material.

This washer is round, if you look at a cross section of it , the material is
square.
&gt;
&gt; .  Do you have a pressure guage?  And AAA?   I just ordered guages
yesterday from the busdepot.  Oil pressure, temp an CHT.  I think that
should cover the basocs for now.
