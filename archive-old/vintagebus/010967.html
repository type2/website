&lt;&lt; i have no proof anywhere, i have just heard some people say they have
 read it somewhere.   &gt;&gt;


Gene Berg actually tested this to find it really helps to cool your engine.  
Thats why he really pushes to put these on your bus.  I personally think its 
a load of BS.  I would NEVER run it.  Looks UGLY as HELL.  the ones from EMPI 
that any local VW store can order for you are pretty cool i guess they have 
the cool V looking like the front of the bus and are white plastic paint to 
match your VW BUS! i guess something like that.  But if you really want to 
know CALL AND ASK the BERG lady she knows her shit.
