How much does this cost to have a glass shop cut a new one?  I had one
develop a stress crack and it cost me $40 + shipping and about 3 weeks to
get fixed.  Local for the same price would have been better.  Local for less
would be better still.

 what I did for safaris galss was take the old, original, cracked one down
to
 a glass shop and get some cut.   Unfortunately I think the old cracked one
is
 gone now, but maybe someone has one still that you could use as a template.

 think a bicycle inner tube is acting as the seal between  the safari glass
 and  the original frames.
