You don't have a &quot;main tank&quot; and &quot;aux tank&quot; - it's all the same tank.
The reserve valve has two tubes, a short one and a long one.  The
&quot;normal&quot; position draws via the long tube; when you sputter and
make the switch, you draw from the short tube.  The two tubes
are about 1 1/2&quot; apart, so with some math, you could calculate
the actual volume.  Word on the street is a little over a gallon.
For S&amp;G, I cut down the smaller tube on my reserve valve by about 1/2&quot;, 
to make it easier for it to pick up the gas when it comes to that.

&gt; I recently got the reserve tap working in my 1960 Standard bus, so
&gt; I've become more willing to drive closer to the edge of running out
&gt; (since then all I have to do is switch tanks and find a gas station).
&gt; However, my most recent fill-up (which didn't involve switching tanks)
&gt; had me putting in 10.24 US gallons.  How big *is* the main tank?  I'm
&gt; worried that the reserve switch is backwards (although I didn't get
&gt; sputtering when I experimented with switching over before filling up),
&gt; or that the pick up tubes are damaged such that I'm effectively always
&gt; on reserve.  It'd be a real bummer to run out, switch to reserve, and
&gt; find nothing there....
