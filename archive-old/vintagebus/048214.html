Subject: One more on compressors:
To: VintageBus_at_type2_dot_com

In all the comments on compressors, the one thing that is just as important 
as anything else, but no one mentioned is the output of the unit in CFM 
(cubic feet / minute).  What a person needs to consider are (no particular 
order), how much power do you have available in both voltage and amperage 
(wire size), how much air do you need to run the equipment you plan to use 
(use the highest required CFM tool), and of course your budget.

A lot of negative comments have been made on &quot;oil-less&quot; compressors, and 
until you get up into the high dollar range ($2 grand up to 100 grand), these 
negative comments are probably somewhat deserved - &quot;you get what you pay 
for&quot;.  I have 2 60 hp rotary screw &quot;oil-less&quot; compressors at my business that 
run full time with little/no trouble.  On the other hand, I have a 2hp, 20 
gallon compressor at home that I bought new over 20 years ago from WW 
Grainger for around $200.  I have changed the oil in it only 3 time in those 
20 some years (bad me), rebuilt the head a couple times and replaced the 
motor (220 volt) once.  Total repair cost in over 20 years is around the cost 
of the compressor new.  I have painted at least 50 - 60 vehicles since owning 
the unit, and have no problem using my DA sander, straight line sander, 
impacts, ratchets, and even a small Sears open sand blasting gun.  I do, on 
occasion, have to wait for the compressor to catch up, but have never 
considered that a major problem.

Anyway, just had to throw out my $0.02 worth, late, after the thread is 
finished......
