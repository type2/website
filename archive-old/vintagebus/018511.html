Hi All,
    I have a question.I bartered a bus part with a gentleman on this list.
the deal went as follows.
We each had a bus part the other wanted.We both decided to send each other
the parts at the same time.
I sent this fellow the part the same day.Three weeks go by and I have not
received the part I was suppose to get and he has received my part and had
it for 2 1/2 weeks.I email him and he apoligizes
and says he will send it out asap.A week later I receive his part. Another 5
weeks goes by and he now wants to reneg on the deal .In the meantime I have
completely restored the part he sent me.(It wasn't
in the condition he claimed).How fair is that ?? My opinion is if he wasn't
happy he should have contacted me sooner.I have invested a lot of time
restoring the part he sent me.
What is the lists take on this ?
Should there be NO time limit for someone to voice his regrets ????
I feel in the 2 to 3 weeks he had my part(before he sent me his part) he
should have realized it was not what he wanted.Then it was another 5 weeks
before he said anything.

                                woody





PS.   He is now bad mouthing me on the list, WHICH IS WRONG !!
