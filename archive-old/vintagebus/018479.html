Ok, guys, brake it up - stop beating your drums.  

If someone is scared of homonyms, does that make them a &quot;homophobe?&quot;

If a guy &quot;sounds&quot; gay, does that make him a &quot;homophone?&quot;

And as to the original question, it mounts on the inside.  Make
sure you have the correct lense - it's different than the &quot;lip&quot;
lid lenses.
