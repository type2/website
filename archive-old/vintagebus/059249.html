&gt; somebody needs to grab that, iffen its a 4gas analyzer it was 5-10k new and
&gt; all they usually need is a new filter and test gas

didn't check it but the test gas cyl was still hooked up, would have
grabbed it in a heartbeat if I could have figured out where to put it

&gt; &gt; Gas anaylsier in Maryland.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;    was at the Maryland state surplus outlet in Jessup yesterday and they
&gt; &gt; had a full fleged Bear Exhaust Gas analyzer for $100, would have grabbed
&gt; &gt; it but it was too large for my avaliable space so if any FI folks need it
&gt; &gt; grab it quick.  (and then let me borrow it to check my engine)
