Jerome was a blast, over 400 registered and the raffle bus went to Colorado,
see what 50cents could have got ya.

The 1776 single port ran beautiful, only problems were duel carb linkage
poppped off, easy fix, then fowled a set of plugs at 5000 foot altitude. It
took 300 plus miles to break it in, the first 40-50 miles I got
12 mpg, after it started loosing up I got 20 plus and that was with 1500+
lbs of weight in it.  The 3.88/77 4th gear trans was a experience in it's
self, 3rd gear up to 65 mph and 4th gear I have no clue as my speedo only
goes to 70 mph. At 60 mph it seemed like I was idealing. I just ordered a
Tach so i can see my rpm's at my speedo indicated speed. This is a very
interesting combo and will report more on it after I drive solo to the
Solvang show this weekend. If anybody wants to see it, come see me at
Solvang.
