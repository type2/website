&lt;&lt; After adjusting the master cylinder push rod, I still have about a 1/8-1/4&quot;
 of play in the pedal. Will this be enough to keep the brakes from dragging
 when I install the new spring?

If you have about a mm of play before the push rod pushes the cylinder in the 
master cylinder in, the answer is yes.   The brake pedal will be pushed up up 
and away, meaning the brake push rod wont touch the MC until you push the 
pedal.
