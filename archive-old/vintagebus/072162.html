Subject: Re: [VB] Re: bus on the highway

Hi Volks,
Forgot to mention that last year we did get pulled over for having our right 
taillight out in Oregon by thier State Patrol.  It would have been a $100.00+ 
ticket, but they let us wiggle the bulb to clean the corrosion and let us off 
with a warning.  We have been wanting to add a second tailight bulb to each 
stock taillight reflector (As Bob Hoover suggested.) to double the light output 
and again act as a secondary bulb to help prevent a completely dark 
tailight/non functioning signal.  So far we have not found an easy and quality bulb 
holder to weld or bolt in place though.
