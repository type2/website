Hi Tommy,
The 1972-79 bus dual circuit MC will fit pre-1968 buses and give  you the 
safety of having at least half your brakes if a slave (wheel) cylinder  or brake 
line blows out.  Go to the type2_dot_com library for the article we  wrote there, 
and make sure to check out all the other info there!!!  Cost  of conversion is 
as low as $50.00 if you do a bit of wrecking yard hunting for  small parts.
