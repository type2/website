&gt; hi all,

&gt; I have noticed a recent trend lately... Everyone is driving cars other

Well, I'm not.

&gt; Have we moved into a new era where busses are for shows and garages and
&gt; other cars are for driving?

For me, the pleasure is in the driving.  Driving involves risks.  If I had
a barndoor I wouldn't be getting any pleasure out of it because driving it
would be so risky.  Therefore, no barndoor for George.

Others derive pleasure from gazing upon their ultra-rare restorations.  I
derive pleasure from this too, but I don't care to own one myself.  I can
have just as much fun looking at someone else's.

Diff'rent strokes...
