Subject: Original Recipt from Westfalia
Date: Mon, 17 Aug 1998 16:48:26 -0700

If anyone is interested my friend Eric e-mailed me a really clean scan
of his Original recipt from Westfalia circa 1965.  I will send the file
to anyone who wants it to post on their web page (Thom F, Joe C, Everett
B?) 
This would be a really good resourse to post for those who have Splitty
Westfalias but not the recipt.

The recipt has the cost of the SO 42 kit as 1,850 DM (walk-thru model)
about as much as the bus!
the pop-up-top (lift roof = Hubdach) as 375 DM and shipping was only 8
DM.

let me know via p-mail.  
Keep on camping
