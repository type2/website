&lt;&lt; What are your opinions on balancing a bread-and-butter 1600?  I wanted
to do that when I had mine built, but the VWFLAPS talked me out of it,
telling me it was overkill on a stock engine.  I can't help but think
it would help *some*. &gt;&gt;

Motorhead in (I believe), Virginia, does a so called &quot;bullet-proof&quot; engine. 
They
deal with orphan British cars but the theory's the same. Build up the engine
as if for racing - porting, balancing, mild/stock cam, etc. - but then don't
go the full-tilt-Webers...Everything stays understressed lots longer;-)
