Thanks to those who helped me chase my 30-pict2 blues away.  I used a
little JB weld around the plug at the base of the carb and its stop that
leak.  Now that I have the engine running and sounding good, I need to
know what I have.  The number stamped below the base of the generator
stand on the engine is 0748317.  There is also a WA below that number.
I was expecting to find a H stamped somewhere since I have a 1966 deluxe
bus.  But you know that would be too easy.  Any suggestions about the
motor and also the clearance for the valves if the correct size is
known?
