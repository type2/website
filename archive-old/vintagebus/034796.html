Subject: Re: [VB] Adjusting clutch? 
To: VINTAGEBUS_at_type2_dot_com

for adjusting the clutch I first get out some spray lube- wd 40 or liquid wrench or whatever your favorite brand is and liberally spray the nut and thread part of the cable.   even get a wire brush in there to clean the threads a bit helps.  Attach a pair of vice grips to the cable on the fat bit just forward of the threads.  Now you are ready to adjust.   for the wing nut style if it has been previously lubed I can just turn it with my fingers.  If not, I use a small adjustable wrench, 

If you have the nut style I haven't had to do this under the bus recently but I did invest in some Matco ratchet wrenches, they have very few degrees between clicks, awesome.   DO  realise there is a lock nut (11mm?) rear of the 14mm nut, you break them loose first, then adjust, then tighten the 14 and lock nut against each other.


So, next time your motor is out, take a couple minutes to clean up the threads on the clutch cables and lube/grease them so adjusting the clutch is not a PITA.
