Subject: LONG! don't know how it all got started parts request

Hi split nosers,

  Sorry I missed Jerome, I don't think I would have made it out to drive
one of Ronnies 60's out with the airline restrictions not lifted in NY
till thurs. afternoon.  I look forward to making it out West to see
everyone either at Lake Havasu or Jerome next year.  Thanx's to everyone
who wrote up a show report, I enjoyed even the broken down ones.

  Regretfully I still havn't finished the 67', it is so close to being
totally restored I should have just finished it before working on the
Side-Loader, but the Side-Loader much more versatile that I can't wait for
it to get finished either.  So, I've spent my time this past summer
working on the Side-Loader, paying close attention to sealing all the
seams.  If anyone saw the Side-Loader at Jerome last year you would have
notice the seams were all noticably pulling away from the tac welds.  
This would have led to rust outs if not fixed.  My theory is that it was
sand blasted and this created so much heat that it the metal warped.

  As far as working on the side loader -- it all started when I got bad
gas and couldn't figure that out till I changed the rotor, cap, plugs,
wires and went over everything a few times, that led to pulling and
clean/derust/paint the gas tank, which led me to clean/derust/paint the
gas tank compartment, which led me to clean/derust/paint the bed, gates,
side-loader bay. I put two hinge-pin (from Westy cabinets) on the bottom
side and two church key locks on the top so I have lockable storage like
the treasure chest area which is needed for tools on the side loader.

  While I was at it I clean/derust/paint the inside cab area and I put in
JP's free antenna mount (Thanx's!) and the radio shack antenna so tunes
are there, put in a new wiper motor and voltage drop so the wipers work,
put in seat belts. I also put down Randy's wood slats on the bed (this
also was not a standard order and I'm pleased with them also!) The only
area left is the engine bay (need to weld in a new battery tray) and a new
wiring harness which I think I do next year.

  I just received the hoops from Derek, I asked him to make them so they
go down to cab level so I can fit the side loader into my garage with the
hoop still assembled.  As you can see, it is not a standard hoop order and 
he did a great job fabricating them exactly how I requested.  Now to find
a sc tilt or have one fabricated (cause with the adjustable hoops I'll
need to have it fabricated anyhow!)

  Considering the Side-Loader has no front bed since it was removed long
ago; the front hoops had to be 20&quot; longer.  He made the adjustable a
removable part of the u-channel and a welded in piece of strip metal.
Since they need to be welded back together anyhow, I decided the best way
to put them in would be to find two pieces of the bed which have the holes
alread drilled in them, then cut out a section of the cargo floor (which
is not flat) and weld the two flat pieces in.  So what I'm asking for is
if anyone has a single or double cab bed that the bed is trashed but the
front mounting holes are still intact to cut both of those out so I can
weld them in the cargo floor of the side loader so I can mount the hoops.  
I'll either pay or see if I've got anything you need in return.  Pls
e-mail me if you have a doner bed that you don't mind cutting out both of
the 4&quot; square section for the front hoop mounting holes.

  I'll post pictures so you can see what I've done when I finish.

Best,
joe
