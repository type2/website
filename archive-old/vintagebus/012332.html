Hey there...

Just wondering what anybody has to say about keeping yon VW Van happy in
cold weather...seems that some arctic air slipped down into the Vancouver
area and everything is good and frozen...I had some minor electrical
difficulties tonight (turnsignals stopped working for a little while cuz it
was so cold I guess)..  *shrugs*  any thoughts on that?  Any other general
considerations?  

Also, any van-friendly places between Vancouver BC and Penticton BC
(travelling along Hwy 3)?  Just in case of emergency :)  I'm taking my van
back to my parents' place for the holidays, I just got some snow tires
installed, so I should be okay as far as that goes...but it'll be -20C when
I get there (with no garage or block heater)..   Any help is always
appreciated :)  many thanks..
