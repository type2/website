Whoa Andre - those tie rods looks to me like they are bent big time because
look at the tie rod where it connects to the spindle.  The tie rod is jacked
up at an angle instead of sitting parallel to where it mounts to the
spindle.  I wonder if this was someone's lame out way of adjusting the front
end?  If you go to http://home.ispi_dot_net/~elassley.bie/67bus/67busupdate2.htm
and then wait patiently for the pix to load - down almost clear to the
bottom and on the left hand side is a shot from underneath my bus where you
can see the straight line of the new tie rod assemblies.

Later...
