Subject: Re: [VB] 66 door hinge pin

&gt; tricky tricky tricky.   hammer and punch.  loads of penetrating oil.
&gt; patience.  try again tomorow.  Did it to put a drivers side mirror on my 61.  PITA.
&gt; You can torch and quench it if you don't mind messing up the paint. the pin
&gt; gets rust welded to one part of the hinge

They can be dastardly. And they are amazingly hard. Like undrillable hard.
Ive torched and quenched one and it got worse and I had to give up on it.
