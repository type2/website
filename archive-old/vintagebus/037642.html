Subject: Re: '54 update + Oil Pressure and Rear Axle Qs 


Everett,

I wouldn't worry to much about the low oil pressure at idle, it sounds 
like your engine is &quot;NICELY WORN-IN.&quot;  Remember, most VW engines blow 
up due to a flipped valve or melted piston and it sounds like yours is 
running pretty cool.  The low oil pressure at idle is probably caused 
by excessive clearance in the main and rod bearings and as long as 
you're not getting a knocking sound under acceleration you're OK.

As far as the axles are concerned, NO, you don't have to take the 
reduction boxes apart to attach the axles to the tranny.  After 
removing the nuts from around the axle boot mounting you can get to 
the circlip ( I think that's how it's spelled ) that holds the axle 
shaft into the differential.  Once you pop that circlip the whole axle 
assembly will pull away from the housing.

Keep cool,

Jeff
