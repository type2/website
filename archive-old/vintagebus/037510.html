wondering if 
 that is the problem and why it only lasted 1700 miles.   &gt;&gt;
Hi Mark,
When you replaced the throwout bearing did you make sure the throwout arms 
were holding the bearing centered in relation to the tranny input shaft?  
After you had everything back together did you keep the clutch pedal play 
properly adjusted?  If not the bearing would be run against the clutch 
pressure plate constantly and wear it out quick time!    Eric&amp;Barb
