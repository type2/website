Hi Michael,
We have run these Vintage oil/filter pumps with no noticable change in oil 
temps and pressure before or after on our big bore 40HP engines while running 
gauges.
 
 &lt;&lt;Also, it has a threaded hole(currently blocked with a bolt) at the pump 
end of the assembly. The hole is continuous with the oilchannels and I 
assumed it was for an oil temp sender or as one of the connection points for 
plumbing in an oil cooler. Any ideas on that one? I think that the filter 
pump assembly is from the '70s if that helps at all. &gt;&gt;
 We would suggest using it for only a temp sender.  High pressure flex lines 
just would add to the unreliability factor and you would have to replumb the 
case for the extra outlet and block the one from the oil pump.  Yes, these 
vintage EMPI filter/pumps seem to be from the very late 1960s and/or the very 
early 1970s.  Definitely before VW issued the dual relief engine case.  To 
use one of these EMPI pumps in a dual relief cases requires machining of the 
oil pump outlet to match the case oil passage.

&lt; If these 'sanwich ' adaptors do exist, can they be set up to bypass the 
auxiliary cooler when oil temps are below operating temp like with more 
traditional auxiliary cooler setups?  &gt;&gt;
Yes there is.  Do not remember the manufacture name but have one that we 
found years ago.  Definitely would be the way to go if you really have to run 
a cooler and external lines.  Then if you have a flex line failure and catch 
it in time to save the engine you just have to remove the adapter plate from 
between the filter and the filter/pump, add a little oil to the engine and 
you can drive on.  The problem is that there is not enough room between the 
end of the filter and the right side heat exchanger to allow the use of the 
EMPI oil pump/filter with the cooler adapter plate.  If you really have to 
use this adapter you will have to get a more modern oil pump/filter and have 
the filter tower cut and rewelded to angle the filter downward at about a 30 
degree angle so the end of the filter misses the heat exchanger.  The only 
problem with this is that the filter is more exposed to possible FOD.  
   You would be wise to install a type 4 cooler in place of your doghouse 
before going to high pressure oil flex lines to reduce oil temps.

  If anyone has anymore of these EMPI oil filter/pumps they would like to get 
rid of please drop us a note!    Eric&amp;Barb
