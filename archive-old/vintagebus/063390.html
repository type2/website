Subject: Re: [VB] When do I need new drums?

&gt;From: Jason Elm &lt;jelm2_at_yahoo_dot_com&gt;

&gt;
&gt;And the driver's side brake shoes were worn to the metal at one end,
&gt;and barely worn at the other end. I think someone must have driven
&gt;this bus with the e-brake on?

That, or Bus was driven for a long time without the rear brakes being
properly adjusted.

&gt;Anyway, the drum is grooved slightly, but it loooks like it has been 
&gt;turned a few times? The metal braking surface is about 1/8 or so down
&gt;from where the metal comes out from the drum edge (make sense).

Is there a lip around the outside edge?  In other words, does it look
like [___] (lip) or |___| (no lip) in cross section?  It shouldn't
have a lip; the whole outside wall should be at the same level as
the surface the brake shoes ride on.

You might mean that it has a lip around the inside edge, like: b___d
which isn't too great either. 

&gt;How much can be taken off before they need replacing?

See page B-8 1 of your Bentley manual.  You should have the 250 mm
nominal diameter drums (the other choice is 230 mm).  According to
the Bentley, if the walls of the drum (where the brake shoes press)
are thinner than 5.5 mm you can't re-use the drums.  The wear limit
on the inside diameter is 251.5 mm - any bigger than this and it
should be replaced rather than being machined.
