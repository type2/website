Howdy. My Girlfriend is moving out to Eugene in a week to go to school. 
She is leaving behind her (our) '60 bus, and flying out there, so she 
will be looking for a bus or possibly Beetle once she gets out there. She 
also needs a place to live, as some of those plans fell through. If 
anyone can help out, or has any leads, please e-mail me at
rapalmer_at_unity.ncsu_dot_edu
and I can pass along the information. Thanks!
