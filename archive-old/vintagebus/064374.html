Subject: Re: [VB] Divider Felt info

Well, if you mean finding the rarest of the rare stash of gas tank felts,
and gluing over 60 of them together in a row to make the long strips to do
both panels (looks like it would take about 32 for each panel) then yah I
guess that would be &quot;the same thing&quot;.... but could you sleep at night? =)

&gt; does this mean gas tank felts will work for truck gas tank panels?

&gt; &lt;&lt; The felts are 4 long strips covering the entire perimeter, same width
and
&gt;  material as the gas tank felts. Also - oval type holes are punched into
the
&gt;  felt so once it was glued to the divider, it would match up to the oval
&gt;  holes on the divider so you can adjust the divider with the screws
started.
&gt;  I will take some pics of some felts tommorow, my camera is out of batts.
&gt;  Also ill take some pics of the correct bubble head sheet metal phillips
&gt;  screws with fat washers for you. I remember you asking about what kind
they
&gt;  were etc. Actually ill just scan the screws and send them to you.
