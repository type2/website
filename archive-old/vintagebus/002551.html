  HI Volks,
  Here are my pictures of Jerome.  There was so much going on I sure
missed alot!  Sorry for not having any text with the pics.  My sea foam 
green epoxy primered 59 SC is in there but hey, they're my pics!
  The main 'man' Don is right on top, he's got more toys than you can
imagine, you gotta see to believe! COOL!
  Please sit back and enjoy!
