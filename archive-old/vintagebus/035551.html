Is your generator charging well?   Test the output- you should get 14V.   
Also- look at your generator brushes- are they worn down?   Are you battery 
connections clean and tight?I

 ok.... My story:  I was driving around, went to a game, then to Pizza Hut it 
was all fine.  I left the Hut to get something and I got to the market and it 
wouldn't start.  No Battery what so ever. So I popped it, but my head lights 
wouldn't work.  I couldn't do anything at that time, so I went back to pizza 
hut and ate with friends.  It wouldn't start again. So a popped it.  Drove 
down town (this is like 12:30 at night) and got pulled over because I had no 
lights.  
    I looked down and saw that one of my wires was disconnected from my 
High/Low Switch, and in fact it was, this was enough of an excuse for the Cop 
for my lights to be off.  I got out and checked and the lights were on.  When 
I got back in bus died.  It didn't respond to the gas pedal.  
    After my Breathalizer I popped it again (with no help from the cops.)  
And turned the lights on and the van started to die as it did before. I just 
sat and idled it charge the battery.  Everytime I turn on the high beams 
lights the van dies instantly.  With the low beams I have about 30 seconds 
before it starts to die.  I can have the pedal to the floor and turning on 
the lights put a lot of stress on the engine.  I also don't have any 
electrical what so ever.  I limped it home with my mom behind me with her 
flashers on.
    I went out to the bus today. the head lights work fine (with the van 
off).  When I turn the key and I don't think I hear anything.
