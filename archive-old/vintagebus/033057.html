What's the best low cost solution for a temperature gauge? I don't 
want the berg dipstick thing. I want a gauge. If it's off on the 
actual temperature numbers, just that it's consistent. I'm asking 
'cause I always see them for next to nothing at walmart or whatever 
and wondered if one of those could be used on a VW some way.
 - -- -- - -
low cost solution- pick up the guage at a swap or a junkyard for a buck or 
three.   Buy a new sender.      Oh, I found good used senders, but they go 
before the guage does.  I have the kind that screws instead of theoil 
pressure relief plug in my 65 bus.  I want to put guages in my bug,   and 
found a sender that screws in instead of the oil drain plug, it was new in 
the package at a swap for a buck, I couldn't resist.      Found a used 6V 
45year old dipstick oil temp sender and  guage at a swap,  I put in my 53.  
It starts at 120F I think, I like it startng at a lower temp on t he guage 
then I can see it warm up.  checked that old guage comparison with a dial 
thermometer and it is not quite right, but at least I know.    The most time 
consuming part is running the wire(do it nicely) and installing the guage 
holder and wires up front - including figuring out the style in which you 
want it mounted.     The actual swapping out a plug for a sender is very 
simple.
