Rob,

I had this problem once and I disassembled the arms down to thelink
pins. I found that I needed to adjust the number of shims. You may
need to do the same. Others on the list may be able to point you to
the correct proceedure. It is fairly simple but involves removing the
brakes and the backing plate.

Chris

Subject: [VB] Tire Wear


&gt; Hey
&gt;     On my recent trip to the Classic and Octo (6000 miles in 2
weeks) the
&gt; right front tire had some real outer wear.  I was carrying a ton of
stuff
&gt; and with the added weight I would of thought that I would of had
some heavy
&gt; wear on the inside of the tires.  I also had them fully inflated if
not
&gt; extra for the weight.  Never noticed abnormal wear on the tire
before the
&gt; trip but had to replace them as had metal starting to show.  Now
would be
&gt; the time to get them aligned but in trying to think about this I
don't get
&gt; how the outside of the tire could of worn so bad while there was
good tread
&gt; in the middle.  Help me think of apples and oranges
