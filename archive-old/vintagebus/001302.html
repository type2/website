Hi folks,
I could do with some opinions on carrying fuel.

i'm off on some trips, and as i don't have either my tap working right or a
fuel gauge yet.. i'm thinking of taking a gallon can along with me.

i've been carrying an empty (bar a dribble) plastic can with me but that
dribble of fuel seems to be evapourating inside the can and everytime i open
the bus doors i smell the fumes. :(

so is it better then to carry a full plastic can (the type they sell on the
fourcourts)?

or not safe at all? -- is it just better to accidently run out an have a
long walk to fetch fuel.... then again, it doesn't seem too safe to carry an
empty can.

any suggestions if i do, wheres safest to keep the full can.

don't like the idea of a plastic can of fuel in the opposite to battery tray
:(

Glynn
