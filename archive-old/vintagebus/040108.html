Ok, after feeling guilty for sitting back these past few months and 
contributing very little to this site (taking and not giving...), I have 
decided to let you folks know what I am in the process of doing...My son and 
I are in the process of resostoring a '67 21 window Deluxe (going &quot;full 
steam&quot; this summer, when we can both take several weeks off to concentrate 
on our pop/son project). The '67 was exported from Germany to Chicago...home 
of the &quot;salted road, capitol of the world&quot;! Needless-to-say (actually, I 
should say...), the bus is pretty structurally unsound, from the years of 
exposure and car cancer (rust). I, recently, found a '65 standard that had 
absolutely NO rust! I have a great ambition to cut the roof off the '65, and 
install the 21 window roof, thus making a rust-free, non-walk thru 21 window 
(keeping the bench seat, in the front)... I would have to transplant the 
rear windows, from the '67 to the '65, but am pretty sure it can be done. 
Any advice on this issue? My son and I eagerly await your responses. Hey, 
just wanna send out a speacial &quot;thanks&quot; to Ronnie Chase and Clara for 
helping us along the way, Muchas Gracias!
JRuck
