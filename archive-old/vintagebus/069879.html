Subject: Re: Side Scoops

Do know  that LBB's  Jim Bell runs side scoops in the summer ( 110/120 temp )
in Havasu and he runs 20 degrees cooler per his temp gauge. He made the run
from Havasu to I-40 with and without scoops a couple times  and saw a 20
degree drop in temp between scoops and no scoops. He takes them off during
winter and runs them in the summer. Don't know exact temps, maybe Jim will
jump in and give the temp numbers. Don't know of anyone else who has temp
gauge numbers in Havasu  (maybe Lou) , just the fingers on the dip stick like
all the rest of us go by. If you can press your fingers on dip stick without
burning them you are OK.
