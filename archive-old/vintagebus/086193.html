No I  have not been doing that (oiling the under the rotor with a drop or two 
of  oil) Did not even know I should be doing that. What kind of oil should I 
use  the same kind i use in my engine?



Hi Isaac,
All distributors with centrifugal advance (009, 010, 019,  etc...) require a 
drop or two of engine oil every 3,000 miles on the felt  down inside the shaft 
that the rotor caps over.  Since you never did this  maintenance, you will 
need to check that the distributor advances.  If  not, you will have to take the 
distributor apart for a good cleaning out of  rust/dirt and lubrication.  
Make sure to punch mark the shaft of the  distributor and the drive gear at its 
bottom end so you will have the gear on  the same way!
