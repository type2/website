Subject: Got grind?

Ok Here's another one for you guys. Thanks for the shock advice I'll let
you know how it goes. On another note the with the 53. Okay after
warming up and first starting out the gear shifting seems great.
Everything seems real tight and I know the tranny was rebuilt (original
non-sychro first), the linkage seems okay and again very tight. After
driving for about 20 minutes the gears will begin to grind with each
shift even with double clutch shifting. Downshifting is impossible
without grinding. What I don't get is why does it only happen after
driving for awhile.
