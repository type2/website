Have you lost your rabbit-a$$ed mind? I could do it for you, and I've never
sold a VW. Your DD is trick and all, but 9 grand? Please. Miss you, think of
you often. Write me. Bye bye now. The Binz I could understand not selling,
but there are doubledoors around. Damn, I knew that cheap beer was bad for
you.

&gt; I just couldn't do it. After I got home today I called the sales agent and
&gt; told her to cancel the sale and I will mail the deposit check back to her
in
&gt; the morning.
