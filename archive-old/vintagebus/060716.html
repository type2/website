Hi Bryan,
Unless you can find a Doormobile rack all the others we have seen will not 
fit!  Since locating Doormobile racks are like finding dinosaurs walking 
around your back yard, your next best bet is having one made for your SC.  
Try Tom Conner for custom racks.  Tom Conner 635 N North Ave Deer Park,
