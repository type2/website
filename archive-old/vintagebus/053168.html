Subject: RE: [VB] Fuel sender question...

Here is what I know so far:
1)The gauge does not peg when the sender wire is disconnected from the
sender. So no short in the wires to the sender.
2) I tested the resistance of the sender and I get 70 at full and about
15 at empty so I think the sender is good.
3)2 different gauges with same problem so I don't think he gauge is at
fault.

All I can think is that the ground on the sender was bad. Im not sure
how that would cause it to peg. I will try to replace that tomorrow. On
the plus side, once this is fixed the whole rewiring project should be
done! Whoohoo!

Hi TJ,
We have used 6 volt senders and guages on 12 volt.  You just have to
make 
sure the wiring is nice and tight.  We had a ground on the sender come
loose 
and allow the gauge to peg up and down as it loosened.  Finally broke
off the 
needle in the gauge.  We are using a 6 volt gauge with a 12 volt 1968-71

sender in same years tank with no problems in our 63 SC.
   As far as your pegging the fuel gauge now:
Is your fuel tank full?
Do you have a bad sender?
Shorted through wire between the gauge and sender?
Did you mount the gauge with the bracket upside down shorting out the
sender 
wire?
