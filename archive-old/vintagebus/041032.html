Christian,

Try this link:

There also used to be a place called BJ's Heater Service (or something like
that).  I can't find any contact information for him tho.

Hey List,
    Killer time at BYOB and Kelly park eh, need some signs for the swap
though! I was talking to Ronnie on sunday about gas heaters and he mentioned
of someone in colorado who remanufactures and sells them. Does any one out
there know of this and if so could provide me with a way to contact them?
