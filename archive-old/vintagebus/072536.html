Subject: Re: [VB] cooling and charging in a 58 - help

 A bug tin should fit just fine, just make sure it isn't a 40hp tin they are different.It sounds like you have a Motorolla Alt, if it is an alternator. That was the stock alt for a '73 Bug. I had one but I sold it. I like the bosch better because of fewer &quot;extra&quot; parts needed.    Sean 65 Westfalia
