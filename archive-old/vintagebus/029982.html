&gt;&gt; As I was working on my headliner, I found two wires, inside original

&gt;They're for the optional rear speakers - I have a pic somewhere on my
&gt;site of the brackets.

I didn't know about these wires until it was mentioned here on the list.
Looking at the Bentley, and the diagrams on Thom's site, it does show 
these two wires as stock on the '63-'65 USA and Euro wiring diagram,
and as a &quot;service installation&quot; after that.  Does anyone know how far 
back these started?  Just curious.
