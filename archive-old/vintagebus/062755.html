Subject: spare tire question


Hello,

My recently purchased '66 13 Window Deluxe did not come with a spare or
jack.  The Bus currently has 5 lug, 5&quot; x 14&quot; wheels with 185/75/R14 tires.
I believe this is the correct size for a '66.  Any recommendations on tire
sizes appropriate for my Bus would be greatly appreciated. I am thinking the
local salvage yard for a spare wheel, unless there are better ideas. Also, I
saw in Rocky Mountain a Bus jack for $59.95, besides this option, any
others.  I have a 5 ton bottle jack, but it's a little overkill.

Thanks to all,

Gary P Alexander
'66 Deluxe
