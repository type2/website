as for flooring....i had an ez-camper, originally teh flooring was some type
of linoleum on masonite, due to the dimesional availability of masonite-it was
done in two pieces of 1/8&quot; masonite, which led to a crack in the flooring over
time.

I replaced with some baltic birch-which comes in 5'x5' sizes which allows me
to put it under all the cabinets, z bed etc, unlike the original wich did not.
I sealed the birch, an put some sound absorbing pad underneath. I also sealed
the wood with some sanding sealer, and plan no putting linoleum on tht op of
it when  i find something I like
