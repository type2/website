i have actually heard that it is the &quot;short shift&quot; kits that wear the
synchro's in the tranny.  the extra weight on the top of the shifter
would change depending on how big of arm was pulling the shifter around,
and how much jewelry was on the hand.  just seems tome the weight on the
top of the shifter would have nothing to do with it.  maybe im missing
something?

&gt; Hi,
&gt; Definitely get the aluminuim shift extender.  Having that in steel and/or a
&gt; heavy aftermarket knob does ruin the tranny shifting due to the added wieght
&gt; pulling at the top of the shifter.
