Subject: Generator Woes

Hi there,

I have a 1963 bus still running a 6V electrical system. It's got a 1600 single 
port engine in it.

We took a 4th of July weekend road trip through central Oregon (desert climate, 
90+ degrees) to go camping and do some family visiting. Put on about 400 miles 
overall.

Saw the the red (gen) light flicker a couple of times, amd finally in Warm 
Springs OR on the way back, it came on and stayed on.

I changed the belt when I got home, and it was still on. Changed the rotor, the 
points, and rebuilt the (remote mount) regulator/cleaned and checked all the 
connections of corrosion, etc.

I grabbed some model numbers from the regulator and generator, since they seem 
to be the topic of some debate at the import parts store I frequent.

Numbers from the generator:

Bosch
0101206067105
EG 7V 50A 26
VW2119030216

Numbers from the regulator
Bosch
0190350030
VA 7V 50A

These would seem to be 7V, wouldn't they? It seems to me I should be running a 
Bosch 6V, 45AMP, W/ Regulator attached.

I'm not sure though, so I thought perhaps someone might be able to help me out.

Thanks,
Kenn G.
