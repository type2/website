Subject: Re: [VB] parts suppliers in Mountain View, CA

Two places come to mind:

Peninsula Auto
861 Camden Ave #14
Campbell, CA 95008 (South of San Jose)
(408) 378-7033

Van Cafe (formerly Volks Cafe)
1823 Soquel Ave
Santa Cruz, CA 95062
(831) 426-1244

Both have been around forever it seems and have been excellent in my
dealings with them over the years.

&gt; Hi guys,
&gt; Well I have arrived in CA. I decided against the Karmann Ghia. I looked at
&gt; a
&gt; couple, and test drove them as well. I really like the look, but I am a
&gt; bus
&gt; driver at heart. They didn't feel quite right to me.
&gt; I picked up a '69 single cab. Now I need to find a local supplier for some
&gt; basic parts. I was hoping that living in CA, I could find local parts
&gt; suppliers saving me my regular shipping costs... I was also hoping to pick
&gt; up some parts for my bus at home.
&gt; Any suggestions or recommendations...
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; -Kevin
