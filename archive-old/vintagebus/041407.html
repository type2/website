Same here.  The clamp seems to puncture through the dip stuff pretty
quick.  Maybe multiple dips would help.  I ended up cutting up some
thornproof bike innertubes and installing them under the rack mounts every
time.  I guess it ain't all that either since you have to keep a pile of
cut up tubes around and they look goofy, but if you saw my bus you'd
probably wonder why I was protecting the gutters anyway.  Been meaning to
Corroless my gutters for a year or so.  I might have to look into this
Ellis recommended stuff.
