Subject: Westy interior

Hi!

Just got back (to San Diego) from a quick trip to Tucson to pick up 
some DC parts.  Got a very nice bed, and picked up a seat and 
pedestal for Roger Nang, who tipped me on the bed.

(BTW, busses are great, but nothing beats a new Ch*vy truck for high 
speed heavy hauling!)

Anyway, Mike, the seller (and soon to be listee, I think) has sitting 
in his yard what appears to be a pretty complete Westy interior, 
including Z-bed, that he wants to sell.  I thought somebody might be 
interested.

Dave
