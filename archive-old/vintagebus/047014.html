I personally didn't know him and had never corresponded with either but i can
saw alot of his posts in my last year of lurking ,,my deepest symapathy for
his family,its a bad time of the year for this to have happened or any for
that matter been there did that ,i lost a sister in the same manner ,my father
on new years day and my mother's funeral was on the foruth of July in 84 ,,It
ruins your holidays and never goes away ,,be strong and go on ,but never
forget them ,,they'll always be with you ,,,,thanks
