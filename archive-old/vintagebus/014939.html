&gt; 
&gt; Basically Ronnie said that you:
&gt;  1.  put in 4th.  Jack up rear wheels.
&gt;  2.  You have to hold one side of the rear wheel to make the other
&gt; side
&gt; turn.
&gt;  3.  Mark the wheel you are measuring.
&gt;  4.  Turn the crank pulley x number of turns.
&gt;  5.  Record where the wheel turned (?)
&gt;  6.  You can then calculate the R&amp;P and 4th gear with some formula?
&gt; 
&gt; Anyone know the details of this procedure?

Well, if you take the number of turns at the crank, divide by the 4th
gear ratio, divide by the ring and pinion ratio, and multiply by 2 you
will get the number of turns at the wheel (with the other being held):

(CRturns/FOURrat/RPrat)*2 = WHturns

If you are accurate about your angular measurements of the crank and
wheel, there will probably be only be one combination of 4th and R&amp;P
that will satisfy the equation.

There is no direct solution, since you have two variables and only one
equation.  Since there are a limited nunber of values for the gears,
you should be able to figure out what you have.
