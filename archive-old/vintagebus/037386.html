&lt;&lt;    Hey all, I know its been covered before, but what tricks to you all use 
 to keep the halfmoon engine bolt from turning? Ever since I rebuilt the 
 starter and cleaned up the trans, the bolt wants to turn.
 thanks
  &gt;&gt;

if it doesn't catch there I would dump the half moon bolt and get a 17mm 
headed bolt.  you can use stuff to hold it, for tightening, but it will be a 
pain to re un do next time.

then just thread the bolt on as far as you can (I holdthe thread with a small 
screwdriver for starting so I don't push the bolt through and lose it), then 
attach vise grips, then I go under and tighten the 17mm bolt.  with long 
extension.

I thought this was normal when I first pulled a VW motor.  WHat half moons?  
They don't hold themselves.
