Here's where your responses and a day's work got me:

http://www.sonic_dot_net/~mizamook/Rig.htm

I hope this works!  The only thing that I may have yet to figure out is
where does the water that gets trapped in the condenser coil go?  I should
probably put another petcock at the bottom of that as well....Note the
toilet paper filter.  My path is as follows:  From the compressor to the
first set of drainage piping above it, then along a course of about 45 feet
on the ceiling and then down through that first loop with the big drain at
the bottom, up and back down to and through the condenser, which sits in a
bucket of cold water, up into the toilet paper filter, down into the
filter/regulator, and then into the air hose.  I am considering putting yet
another filter inline before the disposable unit that goes on the gun.  It
would be great if I could clip it to myself in some way, so I am dragging
less stuff around....

I just wanna get on the road!  A friend who does bodywork/paint (well) came
over today and approved my setup....but he wanted to fix every little wow
and ding on my bus!  I just want to stop the rust, paint her with the paint
that I got today, and get out there!
