Hm, maybe he's saying it's going to be hot when you drive it, don't expect 
any 160F oil temps and we won't believe you if you say it does.

Clara- at about 50F cooler  than 120F.

 The problem is you live in Arizona! Don't leave anything out in the sun! And
 I've heard it'll just get hotter if you burn gasoline in it!
