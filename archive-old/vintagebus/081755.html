Subject: Re: [VB] Replacing Steering box on my '60 DD

In a message dated 3/6/2005 6:11:48 P.M. Pacific Standard Time,  
jamie_at_kookymathteacher_dot_com writes:&gt;&gt;  When I install the replacement,  how can I make sure 
that the box is in the center.  Does this make  sense?  &lt;&lt;




Hi Jamie,
Not really!  You have to make sure the pitman arm does not get  anywhere near 
parallel to the drag link.  After that you have to adjust the  drag link to 
keep the steering even.  That is assuming your toe in is  correct now.  If not, 
adjust the toe in first, then the drag link.
