Subject: Rear wheel bearings 65 bus

I'm starting to gear up for a trip to Mexico late this year, been
getting the interior of Eugene ready. I have found some cores for
Wolfgang king+link spindles and a reman steering box that I will send
off for rebuilds this month. Anyone have anything good or bad to say
about these spindles and steering gear?  I have talked to them and to
Vintage Parts, and wolfgang seems to be the ones who can help me. I am
staying stock all the way, except for some 15inch bus rims I will outfit
with 8-ply tires just for this trip, and leave the stock 14's home till
I get back. 
I have a relatively new center section trans, which has been a dream for
10k+, but am having some whine from the rear wheels still.  I am going
to do the outer bearings ( the accessible ones behind the bearing cover)
and hope that this is all I need. Has anyone ever done the other outer
bearing and two inner bearings inside the reduction case? They look like
a real bear. I wish I had spent the bucks and had them all replaced when
I had the center section transaxle replaced a year and a half ago. I do
have a decent assortment of pullers at my disposal, but would rather not
have to use any...

I have pretty much already decided that I am not going to replace any of
the atual gears in the reduction boxes unless the are absolutely 
terrible. They are all straight-cut, and therefore relatively
bullet-proof, albeit noisy. 

Just looking for list input on this one...
