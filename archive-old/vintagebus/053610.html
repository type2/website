Subject: Re: [VB] VWoA say they own the word BUG

 
They do own the word &quot;bug&quot; if it is used in a commercial context where it
could reasonably be expected to confuse consumers. Not if it is used in a
different context. Otherwise you would have heard from Disney as well.

This pissing and moaning and feeble threatening not to buy new cars has been
going on for, what, two or three years and it hasn't made any difference at
all.

I really do think that if you want to put the brakes on VWOA legal, you need
to establish a legal defense fund, wait for a case where they go over the
line, and then force them to sue. VW web sites can be counted on to *always*
cave so VW web sites *always* get cease &amp; desist letters--for a lawyer,
there is no consequence in picking on us. This is how they get promoted.

&gt; I received a certified letter today that said im a bad boy because I am
&gt; using the word BUG. It looks like they are saying they OWN that word. Anyone
&gt; had this problem? I wonder if they are going to go after Disney world for
&gt; making the movie....A BUGs Life ?
