What do you other bench seat bussers have under the front seat?   I have 

a bus jack
round tube tool 21mm one end, 19mm the other 
 bar to turn it
Heavy jumper cables I carry to jump someone else
random bits of wire
extra pigtail tailpipe.
various fluff and dirt
clutch and accelerator and brake cables
matchbooks, pens and pennies that fell between the seats
probably other bits of junk.

easiest to get to by pulling the passenger seat forward

&lt;&lt; There's this hole under my driver's seat - I hear it's for the jack and
tools. I've only been in wrist deep. But what's on the other side? I can't
find a hole under the passenger seat. It looks the same from above and
below. Is this some secret hidden compartment? What's in there? A time
capsule? Old German air? A stash of NOS spare parts? A puddle of water?
Hmmm...
