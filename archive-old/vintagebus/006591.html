The London Bridge Bullis (a neato chapter) puts on BBB  every year, this is
the fifth event coming up  January 19,20 and 21,2001.
It started as a bus show (number one), then became open to all VW's, over
the years we have weeded out anything but Type 2's and have talked about
making it a split only (only talked) and decided to leave it as is, OPEN to
any VW transporter, regardless of year. A lot of the attendees have more
then one bus and will drive there bay, etc. to get to the show due to the
distance they travel and the time frame they have to attend. Yes they would 
like to bring there split, but at least they do show up, and the show is
about buses and the people that own and drive them. This show is mainly
planned by 2 of us, John Howard and me, with Lou (volksdragon, making
direction signs) and others here in Havasu helping with the final details
and the actual running of the event. It takes us 6 months of planning and
hundreds of hours of time to put this together all for a few days of fun.
I'd hate to see the hours that ABC put in for Jerome and the time it takes
to put on KP, we can all bitch about how the events flow, but until you've
been there and done that you won't understand. BBB is put on to get bus
people together and to help raise money for the unfortunate children in our
area, last year we raised $2300.00 for the children and hope to do better
this year. All money is raised through donations from various vendors for
the raffle and the auction we have. Look what happens the classic weekend,
this year I will attend the OCTO show (day before the classic and will or
will not attend the Classic, it's to expensive, to crowded and is now a Hole
show), but if your into seeing everything under the sun it could be worth
it, but nothing beats 350 split window buses and nothing but splits at the
PRE CLASSIC OCTO event, smooth as silk, great buses, people and won't take
all your gas money to get in. Just goes to show how much profit is in the
profit motive shows.

ronnie, had to say something.

&gt;I guess I'm somewhat sensitive to this issue, since I

Our show is the ONLY show in Georgia out of a half dozen or
so that is Vintage VW (air-cooled only) and I think that is a
big draw for our show.  We always end up with about 100 cars
in our show, which is more than any other VW show in GA.
That tells me that the people WANT an air-cooled only show.
The other thing that gives our show an identity is it is a show
marketed to DRIVERS.  Our motto is, &quot;If you can drive it, we
want to see it!&quot;  No more that 5 cars out of 90 showed up last
year on a trailer, &amp; I like those percetages.

PS, John, if you would schedule a meeting that did not coincide
        with a VW show out of town I was attending, I would show
        up!  ;)

PPS, Peach State Transporters meets the 1st Wednesday night
        of every month at Maui Taco in Decatur, GA.  EVERYONE
        is welcome to attend (no matter what you drive!)
