Subject: A good show with good vibes.
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

For those who havent been the folks at springfield german in springfield 
oregon put on a show/swap every year on fathers day(gives some of you guys 
who need it a little more leverage eh?) Small but nice, no fees for ANYTHING, 
but you do have the option to buy raffle tickets. Not at all motivated by 
greed, just good folks who love vws putting on a show. I would be kind of 
dissapointed if I drove a huge distance to see the show as its still on the 
small side, but if youre near buy or can think up another reason to justify 
the trip(I'm getting good at that) come check it out.
