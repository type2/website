Subject: Trip report/Vacation

Just got back from a week of Waterskiiing and relaxing.  Well, i pulled
a ligament in my back so i did not ski, but i drove the boat alot.

Anyway, while out in the mountains, i cam accross a Junk yard in
sierra's (Ca) that &quot;Specialised in pre 59 Car parts&quot;.  I had to stop
since i saw a splitty from the road.  He had alot of older cars/trucks
of all makes and models.  It was owned by a 80 year old gent who was
happy to help me out.  He pointed me back to the area where his VW's
would be.  I went back into an area the VW's and weeds resided.  I had
to watch my step for fear of snakes and the likes.  He had 6 splitties,
10+ pre 67 bugs and a few bay window bus's.  The bus's were picked over,
but the bug's had quite a few parts left.  Most were victoms of nasty
accidents.  What i found bus wise was:

56/57 17 window standard deluxe.  The rear corners were real nice.  Very
salvagable with only small dings.  Windo frames solid.  This bus had
factory Safari's at one time.  It was cool to see the original mouting
method.

64/66 21 delexe.  Very rusty.  Someone tried to cut the top off from the
windows at one time.  Roof was not worth the effort though and the
stoped.  this one was thrashed

The rest were 60+ kombi's.  Some had camper kits and others just
shells.  2 very nice front clips.  Good front doors.  no cargo doors.
Good floot doners too.

I was looking for a seat.  No go.  Dummy me did not ask about prices on
the sheet metal.  I will do so nect time i am up there.

Also ran accross a 61 origianl paint kombi for sale.  It has been so for
the past 3 years.  I have yet to find the owner though.  I know it is a
kid who bought it and decided a Nova was more his style.  Some rocher
rust, no interior.  I am sure i will see it again next time.  No price
or phone number.

I also found a copy of &quot;VW, Nine Lives Later&quot; by Dan Post.  It is a
original printing hard bound book that has a pictorial history with misc
stories/letters and info on VW befor 1966.  Many great pictures.  300+
pgs.  Very cool history book.

Lastly and none VW, the junk yard had 2 chassis from old BMW Iseeta's.
I had never seen a chassie for these and did not even know they had
seperate ones.  It was very cool to look and see how they were built.
Bery similar to the VW.  One had the engine and trany still on it.  I
want to restore one of these some day.  Any leads one of these?

Anyway, that was my trip.

Thanks for reading
Matthew
