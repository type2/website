&gt;Hi Ronnie, 
&gt; 
&gt;You don't run gauges, so how do you know your rpms and engine  temps?    

  I do run a tach only and use a thermo gun for the heck of it. Makes for good comparisons when a bunch of buses are 
driving together. On the way to Jerome we had 4 splits and 2 bays, both bay window buses were 15 or more degress 
cooler then the splits when checked with the thermo gun after driving 125 freeway miles non stop.
