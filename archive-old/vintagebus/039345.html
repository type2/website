Hi Eric,
  The cheapest I found for a rebuilt was $199 but that was with sending in 
the core.  I think it was BFY and a few other places. I could not find a 
rebuilt anyway in Dallas (or at least the 6 places I checked) so I gambled 
and bought a used one for $75.  It turned out great but who knows about a 
year or two down the road.
good luck,
Wayne

&gt;
&gt;I am looking for a new steering box for my 67 bus and I am wondering
&gt;whois making a good rebuild these days. Has anyone put one in
&gt;recently?  I saw one online for for around 325-350 for a new one but
&gt;if a good rebuild is half the price I would buy that one as well.
&gt;
&gt;Thanks in advance
