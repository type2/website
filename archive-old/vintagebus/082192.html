Subject: VW Parts - Cheap or Free

Hi,
I'm cleaning out all my VW parts and will put out piles of them on 
Sunday, 11/7 at my place. I've got engine parts, tin, wheels, starters, 
alternator, fans, etc. A bus under dash tray, Thing wheels. A T1 
transmission and a Thing transmission of unknown condition, a couple of 
new exhaust headers and mufflers. Lots of other stuff.

All real cheap or free. Gotta get it cleared out.

Sunday the 7th at NOON. Please, no early visits.

If there's anything left at the end of the day, it'll be tossed in our 
neighborhood trash pick up on Tuesday the 9th.

Stop by 1444 N. Roosevelt, between Olive and McKinley and 3 streets east 
of Palm in Fresno, CA.

I'll try to answer e-mail questions, but no guarantee. I'm not out of 
the hobby yet, but getting rid of everything except the stuff I need for 
my '79 Westy.

 -Harry
