Subject: RE: [VB] Looking for a list member

&gt;Does anyone know of a female around the WA area that drives a high top
van with green and white stipes? Someone sent me an email asking if I knew
her or how to contact her.  Apparently she told him that she was going to
start producing new hoops and bows for trucks.
&gt;
Sounds like Dawn of http://www.plfvw_dot_com
