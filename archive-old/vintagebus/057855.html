Subject: A pair of single cabs for sale near EveryBus

A friend and regular customer of ours, has a couple of singlecabs he
wants to sell in Greenville, SC, a couple of hours from EB. One of them
is a running '61, the other is just parts, year of manufacture unknown. 

I haven't seen them with my own eyes, but another customer who has seen
them said that the '61 is complete, with the usual rust (rockers). The
other is not worth restoring, but may have some useful parts on it.

Neves won't give you an asking price (&quot;Make me an offer&quot;, he says), but
I think he's looking for $1500 to $2000 for both, and he wants to sell
them as a pair. He's been working with VWs for years, but leans toward
w/c diesels.

If you are interested, here's the info: Neves Clayton, (864)895-2072. He
works irregular hours at Home Depot, so you may want to call him a
couple of days ahead so he can adjust his schedule.

I'd buy them at that price, sight unseen, but I've already got a full
stable.
