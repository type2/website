Subject: Re: [VB] Jerome report, more 15window damage, pics (long)

that's a tough one.  &lt;grin&gt;  going to jerome jon and i almost made it there is his 1961 westy.  i got a ride back to cali in sam's &quot;free for a saw&quot; 1970 westy.  (thank you sam!!!)  i think it is ever so nice a bus and would much rather ride in a late model than drive the rental car (non-vw) that was considered.

&gt; Yeah, but what would you rather have? Quality or
&gt; quantity?
