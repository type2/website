Subject: Gas Mileage miracles

OK here is what happened ...
  We have been reading about everyone's mileage at the 20-25 mpg range
and really felt we were missing it since we only were getting about 14.
So we tried to see what we could do to improve mileage.
  Just so you know we have a 59 ddr w/t panel with a 65 ez camper
conversion which included a 12 volt conversion, and a 65 drive train -
big nut tranny, single port 1600 with stock bus exhaust and vacuum
advance distributor and a soon-to-be-history after market air cleaner
(if we can ever find the elusive triangle support bracket from the
coil.)  We run 3500 rpm at 55 mph with 205/75R15 tires (no freeway flier
here.)

  When we got the bus we were getting about 14 mpg. We did the usual new
bus thing of  oil change, and complete service, still at 14.  Installed
a fuel pressure regulator, as suggested in the list, still at 14.  So
then we did a valve adjust and set the timing to factory static setting
of 10 btc.  The mileage dropped to 11-12 and we lost power.  Reset the
timing to static about 20 btc (in the campground) and mileage went back
to 14 with no pinging (as per VWHoward) and the power was back (if you
can call it power in a fully loaded camper).

  Now at the Red Barn our good camping buddies - Ronnie, VWHoward and
Clara directed us to toss the carb we had and to get a new pict 30-1.
Well just so happens that Danny had one there so a couple days later
(post Kelly Park in case it did not work out right) we installed the new
carb.  Mileage went up to 22 and the power is great.

  All of this was on the same trip with the bus getting heavier as the
trip progressed (love those swap meets and garage sales.)  None of these
numbers are corrected for the 10% our odometer is low so it translates
in going from 15.4 to 24.2 or so.
