I believe that bus is in the Abacos, Bahamas.  There is an old split firebus 
down there that is rusted out with OG safaris.  I was speaking with some 
locals about it and they mentioned another one (regular split bus, not a 
firebus) that was underwater and was a great spot for lobster. I didn't have 
the time to check it out, but i would put money on it that that is the bus, 
lotsa people know about it down there.  It is near Marsh Harbor.  Good luck 
for the adventurous ones.  Drew.
