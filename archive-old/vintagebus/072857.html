Subject: 66 and 67 wiper mechanisms and switches

After my leaking incident I can see that my wiper mechanism is quite worn, and as I am currently running it at 12V even though it is a 6V motor (well it is quite fast but not silly fast) I am getting a 67 mechanism as I believe this is a straight swap into a 66 and is 12V - this is correct isn't it?

Is there any difference in the wiper switch as well - can I stick with my 66 switch or should I also get the 67 switch whilst I am at it?

Thanks
Paul
