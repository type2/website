Ronnie,
Wow this has been tough. I tried to p-mail and it bounced. I copied and pasted that and the list bounced it for too much quoting. Anyway, if the
panel is an early 60 Double Door panel in dove blue it used to be mine at one point. 2 owners after me applied the Schwinn logos and did a really
cool job making them look original and worn. If you want some more info let me know.
hope this works, and hope this helps,
Craig
