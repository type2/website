Subject: bearing noise

So...  Usual story: one problem fixed, a new one surfaces...  I finally
pulled the right front wheel off, as it always made grindy noises when
braking when it was cold.  Put on some spankin' new brake shoes and voila!
No grinding, and as an added bonus I can stop in a straight line.  But now
I'm hearing a bad bearing kind of noise (low, fairly loud throbbing hum kind
of sound) on right-turning curves at speed.  Hmm... both inner and outer
bearings were replaced last June.  This time I looked at the outer one only,
but it looked great.  I know I'm being lazy but my yard is a mud pit and I
no longer have access to the shop I was working in last week so I want to
examine all the possibilities before proceeding.  So what I'm trying to
figure out before I go take off the wheel again is: first off, is it
possible the wheel is just too loose/too tight (although I adjusted it with
the help of the shop teacher) or must there be something wrong with the
bearings to get this noise, and secondly, is there any chance this noise
could be coming not from the front wheel (which is where I hear it, I think)
but from a rear reduction box?  Would the reduction box bearings make noise
only on corners or would it be constant?  Because I pulled a couple chunks
of bearing cage out of the right rear reduction box when I drained it.  I
know, this is all bad, but I'm just hoping to use the bus for little errands
and such until I get a real job and money to fix the gear boxes.  I did spin
the rear wheels with the bus off the ground and I didn't hear any crunchy
noises, the redux boxes seemed pretty quiet...

Thanks in advance for any illuminating advice,
Diana
