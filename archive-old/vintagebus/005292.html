Subject: RE: [VB] Holy dirt batbus

My 59 dc had very little rust under it... a few little areas that needed
some attention but basically I was able to get a nice shiny metal surface
with no residual rust with a small wire wheel on a either a right angle or a
straight die grinder... and about 80-100 hours.  I think if I had lots of
rust and faced with the task again I would sand blast it unless it's real
rusty then I don't know what I would do.  To sand blast it, either get it
way up in the air or do the rotisserie thing.  There is no substitution for
removing rust... a chemical 'wash' won't do an absolute job.

I've said it before and I'll say it again... it sounds like a lot of work
but I actually enjoyed the work once I convinced myself to start.  It was
fascinating to look at the workmanship, the weld splatters, the drip
patterns in the old primer, etc. etc. etc.  Just take your time and have
fun! :-)
