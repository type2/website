&lt;&lt; Is a siren legal on a non-emergency, non-official vehicle? &gt;&gt;

If not, I'd like to see every car burglar alarm that goes off get a ticket!  
I live in a downtown area, and I hate those things.  Put a club on your 
vehicle and carry adequate insurance, don't p$ss off everybody within a 
quarter mile of your car.

PS The real benefit to driving a split bus to me is meeting all the 
interesting people, and taking life slow enough to enjoy.  I love driving my 
6V 40 horse panel in rush hour traffic.  I really want to put a sign on the 
back that says &quot;I left early to get there on time.&quot;, but don't want to get 
shot at.
