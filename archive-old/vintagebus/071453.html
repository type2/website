Subject: Re: [VB] guages - many questions

----- Original Message -----
&gt;  How do head temps and oil temps correlate?  Or do they at all.

Head temp goes up with engine load.

Oil temp seems more effected by rpm's. Load as well, but rpm's really seem
to give it a kick in the pants.

You can stick as many oil coolers on your engine as you want, it will not
effect the head temp more than a couple of degrees. That's why it's nice to
have a gauge for both. Adding oil coolers can give you a false sense of
security when it comes to your engine's temp. You can overheat an aircooled
VW engine without the oil temps going over 200 degrees. I did it about 7-8
years ago.  :-)
