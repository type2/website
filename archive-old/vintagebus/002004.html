Hey, I have carried a spare engine more than once. &lt;snip&gt; The  next time I
made the same trip I ended up having to rebuild my engine in Austin, Texas
in a parking lot.
------------------
I blew up the 40hp on the way to Austin last year.  Luckily I had my spare
1600  ready to go sitting behind me on the floor.  I was at a dirty, sandy
state gravel pile, and had to wrestle the engines in and out of the bus and
back and forth.  It was no 20 minute job.  Couple hours to let things cool
even to start.  I took my time and didn't re-install things like bumpers and
the full flow filter was hanging by a coat hanger.  Got me back  home about
4 hrs later.  The bus didn't make that Austin trip.
I try and carry as many spare parts as I can fit in.  Lots of us have useful
spare pieces from the last 20 or 30 years of blown engines, scrap cars, etc.
Might as well cart a few along.  I'd hate to have a part sitting on the
shelf at home when I'm out on the side of Interstate 40 between Gallup and
Flagstaff.
Then again all that extra weight may be what put me there with a burned
wheel bearing.:)
