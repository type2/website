Nay, 
Use common sense, get some sleep and travel safely.
Bring the splittie next year. Buy the parts that you
need at the multiple events, support the new and used
vendors and do all of the repairs correctly the first
time. 

I'd bet a hypothetical $5.00 bill that you'd end up
breaking down and missing some or all of the weekend.
Most of us have been there and done that too many
times. Brakes fail and trash into a family of four and
get your butt sued and thrown into jail for vehicular
manslaughter. Not worth it. Pushing the point to do up
the bus will not impress too many other folks than
yourself.
