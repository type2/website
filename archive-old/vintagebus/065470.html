&gt; Hey Dave,
&gt; when I upgraded my 67 dual circuit to a 72-79 bus MC I used the 79 Rabbit
&gt; reservoir with the original rubber reservoir seals from the 67 MC. I dabbed
&gt; some brake fluid in the seals and on the reservoir nipples  and firmly
&gt; pressed it into the MC with a little side to side rocking. It went down all
&gt; the way, but was real firm!
&gt; 

I went to my local breakers today and got a 68 master cylinder. I am thinking 
of fitting 72-79 brakes. Should I have gone for a later IE servo master 
cylinder. Your thoughts Please Mel
