&gt; The second item is front suspension. I know my torsion bars are either 
&gt; broke, out of alignment or in some other way not right. My front end sits 
&gt; nearly down to the stops which have no rubber left on that side.

Hi Ray,
Is that the top side of the rubber stops you mean?  Congrats on getting the 
steering to work!

 each and &gt; every little bump bangs my front end. The swing arms look to be 
&gt; stock, but how can one tell?

If the trailing arms are that badly bent you would be able to tell from 
looking at the Bus shop manual photos.

 everything down there seems to be equally greasy, but &gt; since I bought this 
&gt; truck in a lowered condition and was able to properly raise the rear, I am 
&gt; perplexed as to what to do with the front. Right now I am running 750lb 
&gt; coil over shocks that I put on yesterday that raises it back to stock 
&gt; height, but it also rides like a, well, truck. What to do with my daily 
&gt; driver to see what's wrong with the suspension?
&gt; 

Does your front end have the lowering adjusting parts welded in the center of 
the front beam?  If so you need to jack up your bus and install jack stands.  
Then adjust the front suspension so the wheels end up as far down as 
possible.  
  If the DPO removed some of the spring leaves the remaining leaves could be 
snap, crackle, popping and ready to let the trailing arms to pop out of the 
front end while you are driving!  If sprong leaves are missing then you need 
to remove them and install new ones.   Eric&amp;Barb
