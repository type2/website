Ok, I got the trailing arms out.  Managed to slightly munge the ends on one
side, but I think it's recoverable.

I took Ronnie's suggestion and removed the movable side, then tried
pounding thru the other way.  It was moving a little, but not much.  So I
put a 1/8&quot; socket over the torsion bar, used my monster 3-arm puller, and
pushed the torsion bar thru.  The last couple inches were still difficult,
but I got it out.

Now that I have them out, what now?  I don't have the parts to rebuild them
properly.  I'm thinking I should clean them all up, re-grease them, and put
it all back together.  A lot less chance of munging or losing parts that
way!

well, how bad are the king/link pins?   you can still get new link pins- same 
as for through 63,  dont know about getting new king pins though, but if they 
are real bad you could ge them rebuilt.   But if you clean up the bits and 
see what shape they are in- that is what I would do if I was you, now all the 
bits are out.

Though if I was me I would have just greased it and driven it.   Oh, ya, that 
is what I did.  :)
