Hi Josh,
If you have not hooked up the battery and have the engine running and the 
battery turning hot that is not normal!  On the other hand if you have hooked the 
battery up it is normal for it to get very warm when it is releasing energy.  
Just like what happens when you go out in cool weather and start to work 
hard.  Next thing you know, off goes to coat/over shirt because you become too 
warm where before you were too chilly.
  On a basic stock VW the points are it for the #1 or negative terminal of 
the coil.  The stock accessory and aftermarket tachs do have to hook there to 
sense how many times the points open and close.
  Which clip do you mean?  The front one the accellerator cable attaches to 
the gas pedal assembly or the barrel clamp that hooks the rear of the cable to 
the carb?
