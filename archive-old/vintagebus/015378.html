I've been off the list during the winter and I'm curious as to whether or
not anyone has pinned down Todd Hill in regards to his business.  I bought a
700 dollar tranny from the dude and it lasted two weeks before it took a big
crap. I then replaced it with an excellent unit from Transaxle Engineering
in Chatsworth, CA ( I highly recommend these folks). I've had no trouble
navigating the hills of Southeast Missouri with the taller 4th gear and ring
and pinion setup. I'm running a rebuilt 1640cc dp in my '65 micro/camper
just in case anyone is interested. It's nice to be back and read the daily
chatter from the familiar names (which is a hell of a lot better than tranny
chatter).  Jim
