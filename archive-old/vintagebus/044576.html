Hi Matt, what intake manifold are you using?  There are many permutations, 
you need to have the 1500 bus one with the shorter throat, it has a 211 part 
number on it.

&gt; OK, my bus is supposed to have a governor below the carb.  I plan to put
&gt; on there.  The trouble I am having is that the gov set's the carb (30
&gt; pict-1) over 1&quot; taller on the intake manifold (single port).  This seams
&gt;  to mess up the routing for the accelorator cable.  It has to bend up
&gt;  more to get to the carb.  Because of this, the carb does not want to
&gt;  return to the idle location.  I have to put 2 springs on there it sort
&gt;  of get it to return to idle.  Was there some other setup for the gov?
&gt;  Different spring?  an i missing something here?
