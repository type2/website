  Hi all,
  Sunday marked the only fire in 15 years of Volksing.  I had an electrical fire in the 
engine bay of my 59 SC, the fuel line did not leak and start the fire, the hose was 
still fresh before with all clamps in place and tight.
  As I pulled into Terry Delaney's driveway I smelled the wires burning.  Upon opening 
the engine lid the fuel line burned through and up it went.  Let me tell you it is a helpless
feeling.  I didn't have an extinguisher but I was lucky there was a garden hose at the 
house.  I did buy an extinguisher today. No damage to the SC other than a real PITA MESS.
  I knew the wiring was poor but not so bad to ignite.  I'll install a new harness and have
to replace the coil, dizzy and ignition wires.  This will put a hold on our plans to get 
to go to OCTO/Classic.
&quot;WARNING TO ALL, CHECK YOUR WIRING!&quot;
  Lou in Soot
