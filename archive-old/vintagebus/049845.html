&gt;&gt; 175R15 (closest to stock size)

&gt;&gt; 185/75R15
&gt;&gt; 195/70R15
&gt;&gt; 225/60R15
&gt;you skipped the size that everyone i talked to agrees is the best possible
&gt;replacement:
&gt;
&gt;205/75/15

I skipped it because it's way bigger than the stock tire:

Specification  Sidewall  Radius  Diameter  Circumference  Revs/Mile  Difference

175/80-15         5.5in  13.0in    26.0in         81.8in        775        0.0%
205/75-15         6.1in  13.6in    27.1in         85.2in        744        4.2%



&gt;
&gt;BTW: i tried to find 175 R 15 or 175/80R15... nowhere in teh US had it, if
&gt;you know of a source please let me know (and dont say Coker, theyre too
&gt;damn expensive for the likes of me)


The 175SR15 (Michelin ZX, later replaced by the XZX, then the MXL I think)
was original equipment on Volvo wagons in the early 70s, so I think there
must be some out there somewhere.  185/75R15 should not be too hard to
find, and they are pretty close, but I don't know if you can find 6PR or
not.
