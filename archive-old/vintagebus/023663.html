Thanks to everyone on advice for fixing the dome lights on the driver
side wall in the '66 Westy.  Ends up there is a fuse back at the voltage
regulator (thanks I would have never looked back there), the case for
the fuse was totally melted, and the fuse had blown too.  Looks like it
got to close to some hot metal.  Once I got that rewired and replaced
with a new fuse holder, the lights worked. FYI These lights are totally
independent of all ceiling mounted dome lights, and the switch on the
steering column.  

As for my electrical outlet not working, I just cleaned the connection
for the extension cord on the outside of the Westy and Voila!  Power!
(insert grunts here)   8D  

Also fiberglassed the leaking water tank what a PITA. And replaced the
seals on one jalousie window, boy was that more work than I expected. 
The metal looked good once I scraped off the concrete like glue used on
the inner aluminum frame.  Only four more to go!

Thanks again,
Ginger
