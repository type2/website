Subject: Dist Q's

I have a Bosch 010 on my 1600sp now and I like it but I am wondering how it would run with a vacuum adavnce dist. I have a 111-905-205T but would like to try to find a VW 111-905-205L (correct year) as well. 
 I am guessing this might increase my mileage? I have a 30-1 carb.
 
Any opinions?
