Subject: Re: [VB] Squeeky Bouncy Pain (lowered '65 problems)

I'm guessing, that if the shock bolt was bent, that means the shocks are
bottomed out, and that might be why you have such a rough ride.

I would remove one of the ends of the shock, put the bus on the ground to
make sure it is sitting at it's normal ride height, and crawl under to see
how much movement the shock actually has when it's in place. If it is full
compressed, or real close to it when the bus is sitting normal, you need
shorter shocks.
