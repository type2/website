If there is anyone that can help out Britt Grannis today, he is broken down
in Western Nebraska area.  Last know to be around exit 117 on I-80. Closest
cities should be Ogallala, NE, Big Springs, NE, Julesburg CO, Grant NE, and
Lake McConaughy St. Rec. Area.  He is approximately 155 miles East of
Cheyenne Wyoming.

I am still attempting to get his exact location.  Please p-mail me today and
I will get back with you as soon as I learn of his exact whereabouts.

He is having engine troubles and is currently searching for a replacement
motor to get him back to California.  As of 7:30am this morning he was
tracking down some salvage yards.

What is Roadcow? http://www.mcn_dot_org/b/roadcow/
