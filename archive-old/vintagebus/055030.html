&gt;I'm pretty sure that when the bumpers are straightened, body filler is used, just
&gt;as in bodywork.  Will the powder used in powdercoating adhere to the
&gt;body filler.

While it is preferred to make the metal straight prior to powder,
it can be filled with &quot; All-Metal &quot; brand filler which will take both the
static charge and the heat of powder cure.
The filler would be for imperfections in the surface, not to fill big dents.
It is not necessary to tin the metal, that's for chrome, as in triple
plate, where you get copper, then nickle, then chrome.
The only prep a bumper needs is sandblast, with no oily fingerprints.
Definitely get a zinc primer for the bumper and for the wheels.
As for the wheels, get them balanced with weights only on the inside.
