Do any of the listes live in New Jersey?
I am looking for a shop to do some work on my case (boring ,case savers,line 
bore,etc.
I am looking for a vw specialty shop since the two regular shops i asked at, 
quoted insane prices and the other said he wouldnt do it (not worth his time 
to set up the machine for a vw).

Im in cental jersey, and dont have a problem going out of state, Penn, new 
york,maryland,delaware.


if you can help ill name my next daughter Thom!!!!!!!! :):)
