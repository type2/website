&gt; Subject: [VB] Stereo Installation 8-track to CD - theft deterrent

&gt; Someone recently asked about stereo installation so I thought I would
reveal
&gt; how I did it in my 63. I started off getting an under dash Pioneer Super
&gt; tuner 8-track tape player. You remember the ones with the big round dial.
&gt; Anyway their was one small hole in my tray along the passenger side. Not
&gt; knowing what the hole was for and not wanting to drill any more holes. I
&gt; decided to bolt the under dash bracket down with only one bolt. This was
&gt; fine because the lip of the tray kept it from moving.
&gt; The novelty of the 8-track was pretty cool for a while, hell I even went
so
&gt; far as finding a guy that still could record to 8-track and had him make
me
&gt; up some tapes. Though about 9 months later the tape player quit working
and
&gt; within another week or two the radio faded out.
&gt;
&gt; So after this I took the radio out. I decided to gut the radio and make it
&gt; into a case that would hide a CD player. These old 8-tracks have wider and
&gt; taller bodies then our newer DIN chassis radios.
&gt; To do this I unscrewed the box and removed the tape mechanism and tuner
&gt; portion. Next I took the faceplate with all the metal parts that were
&gt; extruding from the inside and spread epoxy into bottom edges of the parts.
I
&gt; then took the plate over to my band saw and cut all the parts off flat at
&gt; the edge of the face plate. The epoxy kept things from springing out and
&gt; flying all over when cutting. Once this was done I positioned the tape
door
&gt; closed and filled the back of the faceplate with polyester filler (bondo).
&gt; This was to fill in the cavities in the cut parts and to create a flat
&gt; finished surface when the face plate is open.
&gt;
&gt; Next I took a couple of small hinges and attached the faceplate back to
the
&gt; body case (from the under side)
&gt; Now the 8-track box was complete. To put the CD player in, all I did was
&gt; measure the height and width of the new radio verses the 8-track tape box
&gt; and cut two square wood spacers for it, I finished the one that would be
up
&gt; front in black vinyl. I then slipped the cd player inside the spacers and
&gt; placed it in the 8-track box. All that was left was to bolt it back
together
&gt; and hang it back in the bus.
&gt;
&gt; Now I have a nice stereo that looks like an old 8-track that no one wants
to
&gt; steal.
&gt; If anyone wants pictures I will send / post some
