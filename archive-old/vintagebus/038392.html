Geesh, so much detail.  Forgot some things.

1) Assume that there are NO WELDED repair panels anywhere.  CurrentOwner
(CO) claims so and a listee who took the photos could find no sign.
2) No or little bondo detected, but you never know under a good paint job
like it has...

Also, any thoughts onto the general repair strategy for this type of repair:

Dented cargo bed:

Dents in the roof, appears the PO had kids or something who stood in bed and
made dents on roof ?

I ask this for sake of understanding value of such repairs, I know I don't
have the talent!  Anyone done or had done this type of work?  Can dent
removal (like Texas hail storm...) be used to remove the roof dents?

  Stephen
