Eric
Pacific WA

I am looking to TRADE for a very nice early bus or double cab. Value must be

in the $6000-$8000 range.

What I am looking to trade with is my restored 67 Karmann Ghia with over 
$8000 invested. Body and pan are perfect. 1600 DP with dual Webers. Dropped 
spindles and lowered in back. New tires(145's/165's) and new wheels. All new

interior and much else new. (Custom) restoration completed summer of 1998. 
Has approx 7000 miles since then.
Photos of the vehicle can be seen at
