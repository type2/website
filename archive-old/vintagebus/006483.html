Subject: Re: [VB] Middle seat fit

Headrest holes means the seat came from a 73 and up.

I don't have an extra armrest but I will keep an eye out.......


&gt; I believe that is what came (not originally) with my
&gt; 66 Deluxe that I am restoring because the middle seat
&gt; has plastic plugs where a set of headrests should go. 
&gt; I should be able to cover these to match the other
&gt; seats but I need an armrest as there is only a
&gt; protuding metal and it doesnt look very safe.  If I
&gt; left it as a hippy bus I could give it the Red Green
&gt; solution and wrap it with a bunch of duct tape.
