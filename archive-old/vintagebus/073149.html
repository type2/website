Subject: Re: [VB] Arizona Transaxle Exchange involved-2alarm Fire!

If one fire house can douse the flames then it's a &quot;one alarm&quot; fire. If it is
so out of control that an additional firehouse EQ and personnel are required
then the dispatch signals an another firehouse(s) and becomes an incrementally
larger &quot;X&quot; alarm fire.

I am checking this AM to see if all are OK. I am sure that the people are safe
but the intrinsic loss of the huge stock pile of tranny cores and parts will be
an additional death nail in the coffin of the VW aircooleds.
