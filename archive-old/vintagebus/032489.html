I was noticing that on the hall of shame there is some new pics, but shouldn't
there be a clause somewhere, that if a previous hall of shamer, is making the
attempt to redo a bus that someone else had made &quot;special&quot;, it should be
removed. If your interested in which bus I'm refering to, please mail me.
