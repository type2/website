&gt; &gt; If you want heat.  You don't know how many people I've seen put full
&gt; &gt; headers on because they &quot;needed&quot; the extra power, only to rue their
&gt; &gt; decision when old man winter came knockin'.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; If you live in the tropics, then by all means go for it
&gt;
&gt; Amen to that!
&gt; I moved from Germany to Texas. Drove my bus from PA to TX
&gt; Before I drove it down I put a new engine in it. When installing it I used
&gt; J-tubes.
&gt; Well the winters here have a worse bite than I thought! If the ambient
temps
&gt; don't
&gt; drop much below 40 degrees you'll be OK without them. I heard using
J-tubes
&gt; actually
&gt; makes yourengine run hotter(someone here?). Found no proof of this, I
drove
&gt; my bus 1,800 miles
&gt; here in 95+ degree heat, and here in 110+ heat without any overheating
&gt; problems.
