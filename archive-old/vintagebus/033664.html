Subject: RE: [VB] Weber carb and shag carpet ???s

   Yes they are Weber knockoffs made in Brazil and imported by Johnneys
Speed and Chrome and Claudes Buggys. This were one of the first cases of
bootlegged items in the VW seen and was shut down by the FEDS!&gt; There are NO
PARTS available for these and they are good to use for bottom fishing
weights. Maybe if I collect enough of them I could make 1 good one!  If you
look at them closely they do not say WEBER, just use there logo.

Ronnie   of course I could be wrong, I have been before and am not afraid to
admit it.

as far as shag carpet, I have some beautiful green shag that was used to
upholster a flip seat I have

anyone know about the single Weber carb that fits a sp manifold?  The stock 
air cleaner system fits it too.     what's the deal?

how much does it cost to get enough shag carpet to do the inside of a bus?

:)
