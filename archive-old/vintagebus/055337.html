    &lt;&lt; the bed of my DC has a side-to-side seam never apparently welded, but 
leaks and allows a lake in the cargo/rear cab. would i be wrong in having 
this seam welded, or use a more flexible filler since it wasn't welded at the 
factory? &gt;&gt;

Hi Steve,
Best to have that seam welded.  On our 1963 SC we welded all four sections of 
the bed panels together to prevent future leakage.  Using silicon is not a 
good idea due to flexing of the panels will loosen this sealant up in 
sections and start leaking again.
