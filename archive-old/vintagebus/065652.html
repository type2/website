Subject: Leaky RGB part duex

To answer your questions, yes I just got a new (to me anyway)
transmission installed in Alberqurqe by foreign aide (a shop in town).
They filled it, so it could have been overfilled.  However, I drove it
600 miles back to Stillwater, OK presumbably leaking (or weeping) the
whole way, then it has been weeping in my garage for five days now,
(probably about a half cup has been lost on my garage floor).  I checked
the level in the RGB last night and there is fluid in there, and I also
topped off the tranny (which didn't hold all that much)  So how long
should I wait for the dripping to stop?
   Thanks
