&gt; &gt;Just curious what other genetic mutations everyone else has seen.
&gt; 
&gt; I know of a guy here in AZ who took a perfectly fine splitty
&gt; westfalia and
&gt; welded the
&gt; bed of a single cab to the back of it, axles and all(basically a bus
&gt; twice
&gt; as long with 6 tires)...

Lots of talk about making long buses, but a few years back I was in
Lyle, WA and saw a bus that had been shortened.  Essentially, they had
taken out the section defined by the side door, and welded the front
and back bits together.  Looked really tippy.
