But when you really think about it, try it, it's not too hard, make a
drawing if possible, when you count all the years, months and days you
figure that from day one of January 0001 till December 31, 2000 it was 2000
years even. We didn't start this calendar from year 0, we started from
number 1.

Just my 02 centavos, right?

Flame me, I need it, it's friking cold in the Midwest now.

&gt; Not to get off on a tangent but 9 is the end and 0 is the beginning of
&gt; any numbering system. At least in this known universe. Hence 2000 is the
&gt; starting point and when 2001 comes about, the 21st century will have
&gt; completed it's first full year. Like fractions. You start with 0 then go
&gt; through a fractional series in order of one decimal point greater than
&gt; the last to get to 1.   i.e.  0, .25, .5, .75, 1.0. Time is no different
&gt; in numbering than any other measurement. :)
