 &gt; you dont' need a gas heater for the air cleaner.  Yes the 36hp air 
cleaners

At

the 
 &gt; carb that much you can use a bus 40hp air cleaner, they have the pre heat

 hrmm,
 
 I have a 4o horse bus aircleaner then i think... has the metal elbow tube
 thingy and hangs down with this little bitty teeny tiny oilbath with a
 flap (broken and gone) and hole for preheat.
 
 I was told that if i run it on a 1600 the engine will suck the oil out of
 the bath due to its small size, is this true?
 ......................
well, I have run the same 40 hp aircleaner in my 61 with 1600 sp.   When I 
changed the oil in the aircleaner it did not look like the level had dropped.

For those who are unclear, it was wordplay when I wrote about the carb using 
a gas heater.  This is a form of humour.  nevermind.  Sort of like how when a 
friend and his dad were talking about the new juice, the dad was saying how 
it separates the juice from the pith of the vegatbles of fruit you are 
juicing, basically it takes the pith out of it.

However, if you get an aircleaner with a functional flap, you can attach a 
pick up tube, and not use the gas heater.  oops, I mean you get preheat off 
the cylinder head.    

But to answer the intended question, I'm not sure about the air cleaner 
bracket deal when the bus has a gas eater in it.  (for heating the bus, not 
for heating the air cleaner)

Though I doubt it would be easy to find such a bracket, I am sure you could 
make one.
