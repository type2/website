Man, that gives me soooo many great ideas.  To think i even wasted my time
with sheetmetal.

Emmet

p.s.  Im thinking of starting a new brokerage site.  I plan on importing VW
Bus enthusiasts for top dollar!!  Im using myself as a test model, so if
anyone wants to import me to your country I'm asking $40,000 usd. (sorry,
bus is extra)

Subject: [VB] What happens to a Bus when it gets to Japan


With all this griping about a bus going to Japan, I thought I'd do a little
research into the subject and found an interesting page.  It's not for the
easily frightened among the list.  Be forwarned, the page takes a long time
to
load, bus nazis will have a heart attack, it makes you wonder where they get
all
there money to do all that work.
