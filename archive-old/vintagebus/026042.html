I sold a couple things to a guy in Canada and today he informed me that when
it arrived he had to pay tax on my declared value and some bogus handling
fee, adding about $10 CDN to his cost (on a $20 US item).

He intends to purchase some additional items I have, how can we beat the
system in the future?  I'm not sure I marked it as a &quot;gift&quot;, assuming that
would do something...

P-mail me if you're nervous, since the Pentagon does monitor list traffic.
