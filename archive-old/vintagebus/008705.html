Subject: Orientation of the generator backing plate?
Date: Tue, 7 Mar 2000 23:11:32 -0600

One more question I have:  When I installed the generator, the terminals
were pointing almost straight out to the right side of the engine.  I think
I need to know where the &quot;slot&quot; in the backing plate goes?  Does it point
down, up, or to either side?  Those of you who have pulled backing plates
know what I'm talking about when I talk about the slot.  IT's kind of a
hollow area between the backing plates and it sits inside the shroud when
everthing is installed.  Later!
