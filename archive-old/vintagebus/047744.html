&lt;&lt; It was my intention to remove the entire transaxle for my first ever redux 
box work. It is a bit messy in the area of the transaxle becuase of bad boots 
and I thought it would be easier to clean up the mess with the tranny out 
because my timeline is getting shorter. I am now leaning towards rebuilding 
the left RBG in situ. I have consulted the Bentley and this seem to be an 
acceptable practice.&gt;&gt;
Hi Chris,
Unless you want to do more work, and spend more time just do the reapirs with 
the tranny in.  Taking out the engine will help, and give you practice, but 
if you remove both of the reductions you have all the more chance to strip 
out the holes that the mounting bolts thread into that hold the reduction 
boxes to the spring plates.
 
&lt;&lt;Is it possible that the wobbley stub axle is not the result of a bad
 bearing( hoping for lower outer only:)?&gt;&gt;
Not likley.  All too often we have know others that have just replaced one to 
end up replacing them all 10-20,000 miles later.  Once one of the bearing 
starts to go it tends to put metal flakes in the oil which screws up the rest 
of the bearings.  To really check the bearings for usablity you have to hold 
them up one at a time to your eye with a light source on the other side, and 
very carefully check for any pitting in the inner or outer bearing race.  In 
otherwords the races have to be spotless.
 
&lt;&lt;Can I get by with garden variety off the shelf pullers to get the bearings 
off?&gt;&gt;
We have been able to get them off with common variety tools.  Just never 
hammer on the end of the axle shafts!  You should check out the bearing 
pullers you can make in the Idiot's manual by John Muir.  Not beautiful, but 
usable.   
 
&lt;&gt;
Some only will use German, others are happy with Brazilian.  We have not had 
any problems with either as long as they are a main manufacture name.
