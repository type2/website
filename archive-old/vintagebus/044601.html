no, but I do have this small stud DP motor that I think is out of some late 
bug and there is no road draft tube. 
 not only that, but the breather tube off the oil filler is much bigger.   
And the intake manifold has this thing pointing out towards the back of the 
motor (crank pulley side).  then this other thing bolts to it with two 10mm 
headed long bolts.  and a tube from that goes down to the left side of the 
tin, another junction and it runs underneath where at some point someone 
pinched it off.  what the hesshus is that?  And then it has this alternator 
that has 4 yes FOUR places to plug in?  what can I do with that?  looks like 
it needs an external regulator or something- says VW and has the Motorola 
symbol on it and says made in the USA.   SO I said bus gets a generator.  SO 
I get to swap some stuff around Joy Joy and change the oil cooler and main 
seals and install the thermostat stuff.  WHy WHY WHY do they sell you only 
two of the seals you needfor doghouse when you need 4?  

anyway this engine runs, I ground ran it, sounds good, but if you get that 
motor go ahead and change the seals there

I heard that the bug FI has problems.  If yours goes bad, swap to carberation.

 What I meant was that I was just wondering if anybody has that same FI
 engine installed in their bus with FI still attached to it. Just curious to
 find out if there's more work required on conversion.
 
 Thanks,

 &gt; &lt;&lt;and that's what I've got. It's a 73 engine. I'm kind of toying with
 &gt; the idea
 &gt; of buying this bug that I've seen sitting in the mechanics lot which has
 &gt; an
 &gt; FI engine in it. Mechanic does not know how to work AC engines, admitted
 &gt; to
 &gt; me myself and poor owner want's to sell non running SB. $500.00 seems
 &gt; too
 &gt; high. I want to offer $200, see if it sticks and then somehow work the
 &gt; engine into my bus. Can someone give me some feedback on this?&gt;&gt;
