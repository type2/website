 while we're on the subject of safaris (maybe we're not
 anymore, i'm kind of slow), i've been thinking about
 getting them for my Dormobile since i cracked the
 driver's side windsheild while removing it. it would
 be nice to cruise through hillsboro village with the
 windows flyin'. so what are everybody's thoughts on
 safaris? who has them? are they worth the price and
 the leakage? the way i figure is, what other vehicle
 can you put safaris in? i might as well take advantage
 of it if i have the opportunity. let me know what you
 think.

I have safaris in my 61 deluxe that unfortunately is not running right now.  
After going through that, when I got my 65 wetsy (westy)  that had safaris, I 
took them out after the first summer and sold them to a guy in Bakersfield.

So I think I can talk from a standpoint of someone who has been there, done 
that.  And while it is awesome to have the safaris open on a hot sunny day, 
yes they leak.  With NOS seals the 61 barely dripped for 2 years.  last year 
I installed a regular windosheild drivers side, as I crack th pass side more. 
 On freeway, I would crack the pass side and prop it open with a piece of 
1x2, so the wind stress did not bend the chrome props, or the wing nuts have 
to deal with it, plenty of ventilation that way.

If you live somewhere warm and dry, they kick booty.  But I live in the PNW, 
it has been pissing rain all day.  Just got home, driving my 65, not a drip.  
(we get serious about seals here. roofing tar is my friend)  If I had safaris 
in it, my shoes would have been full of water, and my stereo ruined by now.  
When I painted it, I removed the package tray and it was like swiss cheese, 
so I replaced it.  And actually the windsheild ledges were in remarkably good 
shape, think it had moved here from Pasadena in the mid eighties, and the 
safaris were siliconed shut when I got it.   

Sunday driver with a garage to park it in? cool beans.  or weather normally 
dry, go for it.  if you want to put them in a daily driver, do really think 
about the rain and drip and rust, they leak.  repros leak worse than 
originals. Don't take my word for it.  Anyone want a ride in a bus with 
safaris?  Come over and help me get my 61 sorted out and then lets head up to 
Capitol forest, take a drive in the country.
