&gt;&gt;Personally I think that of the two the RAL 9003 (Signal White) is the best
&gt;&gt;match to L-82.
&gt;
&gt;What type of spectrophotometer are you using to match colors and what
&gt;lighting?
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Dave

We've got A Hunter ColorFlex using D-65 10 deg. a Macbeth Color-Eye F12 10
deg, A2 10 deg &amp; D65 10 deg (to combat metamorism) and lastly a X-Rite SP68
that can read A2,C2,D65,F2,F12... 10 or 2 deg.

Although reading a RAL standard color swatch with a Spectrophotometer and
then a painted part are invariably going to cause a metameric situation
being that the paint contains different pigments/dyes. 

The color seemed to be best under D65 10 (0.79 delta L, -0.19 delta A, 0.45
delta B) 

Ben

p.s. as always color is seen differently by everyone and the sample of L-82
that i measured was from a recent repainted part (Good match supplier
Stated less than 1 delta L from standard specs).
