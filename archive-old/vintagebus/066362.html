Subject: Snake oil or real product

  I just had a salesman walk in showing me a new product made here in
Havasu. It's a magnet that attaches to your oil filter to trap metal
particals as the oil travels through the filter. I took a look and said
hummm, I wonder if it works. So he gave me one that will fit on my oil
filter pump filter to test.
  Here's what I am going to do. I am going to remove the existing filter on
my bus (1500 miles) and install a new filter (with filter mag attached), but
not change the oil. I am going to drive my bus another 1500 miles, then
remove the filter with the filter mag attached to it.
  I am then going to call the salesman and he is going to come back to my
shop and dissect both filters (in front of me).
   It should be interesting to see what, if any difference of what the
filter traps. I will keep the list informed on this

ronnie

ps. I also gave him a drain plate and screen and asked if they could make
one of their magnets that would work on that for those of us who don't run
filters.
