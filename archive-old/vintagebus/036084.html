&lt;&lt; Hey all,
 
 I was wondering if someone could give me the normal and maximum shifting 
 speeds/ranges that people follow running bignut trannys and freewayfliers.  
 I've got a 66 bignut and don't have much to compare to.  I have been 
 following the muir 15 25 40 marks as redlines.  Same deal with the tics on 
 the speedo.  A friend with a bus says he'll wind 3rd up to 48mph or so no 
 problem.  Would like to figure out if I possibly have a freeway flyer.
 ---------------------
I have a big nutty 3.88 r&amp;p (freeway flier) tranny in my 65, and generally go 
with the red lines on the speedo (15 25 40) but will push it a bit more up a 
hill.   But to see what your r&amp;p is, get or borrow a tach, and find out what 
speeds you have at 2K, 2500,  3K , and 3500  in each gear (well just 3K in 
1st).  also are your tires all the same size?  it will skew the results if 
you have different size on back, where your gears are, than the front, where 
the speedo cable is.

I can wind my bus up to 48 in 3rd, but generally don't do that on the 
principle that if your beat it it doesn't live as long.  38 on the speedo is 
3K rpms,
