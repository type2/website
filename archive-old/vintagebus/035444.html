Ok, I messed around with the bus more today, but my limited knowledge

lessens my comfort level with going further without some guidance. I

adjusted the valves, per Muir at .006, and, while it runs smoother and

doesn't backfire, it doesn't STAY RUNNING!?! If I keep the clutch out, it

stays running for about 20 seconds, then bogs out. Tap the gas you say? HA!

It bogs out and stalls. I'm at the end of my wits here, it ran fine when I

parked it, and now it doesn't. Any help is appreciated. Thanks.

You need air, gas, spark.   sounds like gurk in the carb.   Ist check the
spark.   Then make sure you are getting gas by having a friend watch the fiter
to see if stuff goes through it when you start the motor (or even just run the
starter motor)   Or even unhook the hoses from the carb and turn the motor by
hand.  Okay if it comes out the hose to the carb- what does it does then?   Is
it going through the carb?  What kind do you have?  A 34pict?  I dislike those
carbs.  I like them small and torquey.  round bowl.   less goes wrong.   take
it off- is there gas in the bowl?    Does it spray out when you pull the
accelerator arm?  Perhaps disassembly and cleaning is in order.
