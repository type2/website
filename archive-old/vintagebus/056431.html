Subject: [VB] IRS on a Splitbus &quot;again&quot; ;-) with a Prosche 914 gearbox..

&gt;A Porsche 914 gearbox pop'ed up in a classified in Denmark. I don't know if it's a gearbox to 4 cylinder or a 6 cylinder &gt;porsche
and I don't even know if there are any difference.

&gt;I might be able to get some numbers if it's necesarry, but how will it fit into my project, instead of a 1303s gearbox.

&gt;The engine to pull all this will be a 1914 T1 with a single carburator.

The essential difference is in the location of the shift mechanism.
Early 914 ( and 914-6 ) shifts from the tail, while later models
shift from the side. Gear ratios are easily changed to suit your needs.
