Use the longer style ones.....they pop up on ebay 50 times a week.
Shouldnt be tough to locate a nos one.

&lt;&lt;List:

My '59 Westfalia was in the transition year where the 36hp motor was used 
(prior to the Bastard motor), but VW had changed from the pressed bumper to 
the more common later style slash bumper that was used from '59 to '65.  The

36hp muffler with the single muffler tip works fine with a pressed bumper, 
but will it work o.k. with the slash bumper?  I can only assume that the '59

transition year 36hp buses had the earlier single tip muffler, but does it 
require any kind of adapter or modification to clear the later slash bumper?

My motor should be ready to install within the week, so I haven't had a 
chance to actually mount the muffler and bumper.  I just would rather not 
have any surprises when I get to that point, so thought I would ask the 
question now.

TIA.
