They're buying them from all of the usual suspects. Wiring Works makes them,
link on Thom's site. It is not especially difficult to make one, providing
you have a good one to copy, but when you break down the cost for all of the
various sizes of shrink tubing, the specialized crimper, the multitude of
wire colors and terminals, you could not hope to make one for anywhere near
what you can buy one for. The harnesses they make are nice, the colors are
correct, even if the wire is not an appearance match for the original. Worth
the bucks, I think.

&gt; So, are people making their own harnesses, or buying them somewhere? If
&gt; buying, then where and how much? If making, then can anyone good at
copying
&gt; and following directions tackle it?
