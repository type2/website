Subject: FS 59 westy, 65 panel camper, 67 kombi, stuff etc W. Wa

I need to thin the herd.   I still have the 59 westy project, (no motor, 
battery not included, some assembly required) early 59, ie came with split case 
tranny, 36hp motor

I have a 67 kombi that will be FS when I track down the electrical demon that 
keep the starter motor from working when I turn the key (it did used to start 
fine).  just your basic white bus with back seat, walk through.

I have a ratty 65 walk through panel camper that has a dead motor, I may put 
together a motor for it, or if someone wants a bus w/dead motor to put your 
spare in, that's also a possibility.   amazingly rust free, but some body damage 
on drivers side (front door shuts funny).  The PO ran it low on oil.

I also will try to put a bunch of crap FS on the samba or (gasp) ebay, 
including a working '67 sapphire 12V radio (think it's sapphire V, would have to 
check)

More parking space would be nice. pmail me if interested.   

located in western WA
