&lt;&lt; I don't think an 8-track will fit in a '66 radio hole without serious

Hi Volks,
Agreed that the radio hole in pre1967 buses is too small for 8 track.  Both
Clara and us have found Pioneer 8 track players.  Apparently this model was
only made for one year and the next year was converted into a cassette player.
Along with playing 8 track tapes it has a FM feature, but no AM.  Plus it is
made to bolt under the dash/package tray, so you probably could have a AM,
AM/LW, or AM/SW radio in the dash and the 8 track/FM bolted under the tray.
