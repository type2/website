&lt;&lt; ou're justing posting that to make people jealous.  okay it works.  next 
thing,  what does it cost to get more, and more importantly, can you get the 
proper molded seals for the corner windows?   I have not taken them out of my 
61 even though they are rock like and leak because I am afraid to break the 
sigla curved glass installing with non vw seals. &gt;&gt;

I paid the guy $130 for this set including shipping from germany, which came 
to about $30. He said he had more of them, I could try to find his card if 
anyone is interested. I found him through an ad on vw planet (thanks 
Everet!). I didnt even know the aftermarket seals are bad, so I'm no help 
there. any thoughts on wether these are replacement glass or meant for the 
later buses?
