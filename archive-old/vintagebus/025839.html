&gt;&lt;&lt; can someone tell me which busses would have had the subfloors welded in.
 
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;Any buses with sunroof, or double cargo doors, or double slider cargo doors.

High-Roof busses, and fire trucks also had the belly-pans, (at least all the
ones i've seen) or &quot;sub floors&quot; as we seem to be calling them these days.
