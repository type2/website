&gt; Today I went to adjust the valves on my engine. As I pulled the valve cover
&gt; off the #1/#2 side a buttload of gasoline fell out. #3/#4 side didn't. I
&gt; went ahead and adjusted the valves and put the valve covers back on. I
&gt; started the engine and there was fuel leaking from the #1#2 side. So what's
&gt; up with all the gas on that side? 

Apparently, your float valve is leaking, and the gas is running toward the
right side of the engine.  No idea of how it's getting into the valve
cover unless it is getting in through the valve guide.
