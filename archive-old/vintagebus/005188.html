I ordered a set of Creative Engineering safaris a week ago. I mentioned this to another UK store and they said:
 &quot;You should have got Bus Boys Safaris from me - Much better ! ( &amp; cheaper ! )
Creative seals are not moulded, I should have the moulded ones in stock soon !&quot;

I thought that CE were the best...  am I wrong??
BTW  I have a set of Wolfgang safaris in my bus now, and they suck!   The shape of the frame don't fit at all!
And the latches are not looking right...
