Subject:  How to dismember (or mantle) a key barrel from handle?
Date: Mon, 25 Jun 2001 11:28:57 +1000

Greetings All,

I want to pull the key barrel out
of some of my door handles for two reasons..

(1) So I get the handles rechromed, and

(2) A more potentially interesting reason...
I have been told by a normally reliable source
(bout 80% reliable 8-)) that if you take the
barrel out you can actually 're-tumbler'
the barrel to suit your key (as opposed
to getting a key cut to suit the barrel).

Apparently the 8 tumbler gizmos in the barrel are coded
by notches (0,1,2 or 3 notches) and if you
note the order of the tumblers for a barrel
(that you have the key for) you can simply rebuild all
your locks for the one key using tumbler
gizmos that you've pulled from all those
spare handles you have lying around......better than having
one key for every door lock I reckon..

So I decided to try and get the barrel 
out of a junk cargo door handle on the weekend.
All you can see is a very small slotted head screw
at the base of the handle (well stuck of course)....

Anyway I couldn't immediately
see how the thing would pull to bits or even how
the square 'driver' (that goes through the door)
would come out....even after some considerable pondering
and looking I couldn't see how the thing would
pull to bits even if I could get the little screw
out....

So how do you disassemble a door handle? That is
get the barrel lock out of em?  Anyone done it? 
Seems to be nothing in
the archives that I could find....
