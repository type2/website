&gt;Was writ:

&gt;To get really technical, the brake drums, stub axles, etc., were 2
month only
&gt;M215 parts.  These were indeed later 64-67 (rear shoes) on an early
small 

&gt;And was clara-fied:
&gt;-- - - --
&gt;actually the 63 M 215 option was available more than 2 months- think
the 
&gt;entire 63 model year it was available.  (But I have not checked any 
&gt;refenences for that )  Why do you say it was only used 2 months?

The NEATO old bus registry has one bus with M215, chassis 1.170.517,
made September 17, 1963.  It's a Fire Truck made to remain in Germany. 
How many on Vintagebus Registry?  Who else has one?
