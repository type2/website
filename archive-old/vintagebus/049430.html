        Need the above for my 59 singlecab.   Looking for decent used
original if for a fair price.  Will be used as the flagship vehicle for my
moving company as a blanket and dolly truck.  I know about PLF;
better-than-original repros but very expensive.  Too bad about their silly
name...  please let me know of any leads- much appreciated...
