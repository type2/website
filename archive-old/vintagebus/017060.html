Yep, agreed - sounds like a classic case of the left rubber flex line starting

&gt; I am in need of some of the great list knowledge. My 60 crew cab has a
weird
thing going on in the brakes. It pulls to the right when you first step on
the
brakes. It stops pulling very quickly, even though you still have the brakes
on.
If I step on the brakes again right away it does not pull. If I wait about 5
minutes the first time I step on the brakes it pulls again.
