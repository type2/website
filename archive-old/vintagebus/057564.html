Subject: RE: [VB] Cruise control in a splittie!

Eric

  What does this unit use as a road speed sensor?

I installed a VDO unit years ago on a 71 and it had two magnets that were mounted 180* apart on the inner CV and a transducer mounted on a bracket to read them.The throttle actuator was a nice strong electric motor and not vacume.

&gt; Well gang,  I'm almost done fitting a cruise control unit to my 64 delux!
&gt; I had always thought about doing it, and looked at the kits that are offered at the autoparts stores, but never took the step of trying it until I read Donald Gibbons page listed at type2_dot_com.    Seeing that he had sucessfully installed it into a 75 Bay window with FI (not sure if he has the 1.7, 1.8, or 2.0), I figured, I've been doing enough out of state driving, that I could benefit from something like this.
