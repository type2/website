Hi Msfooey,
Definitely replace the windshield rubber and make sure to seal it with 
roofing tar where it seals to not only the body, but where the seal holds the 
glass.  Water attacks the plastic laminate between the layers of glass in 
safety glass resulting all too soon in a nice white haze at the bottom edge 
of the windshield glass.  First though you will have to remove rust and 
repaint the body under the present seal.
