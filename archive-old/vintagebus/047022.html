&lt;&lt; I believe you may also have the option of adjusting the position of the
steering wheel without removing it. I think you can adjust the position of the
arm (can't remember what it's called) on the steering gear box. Of course,
you'll have to remove the arm from the gearbox. I think you would:

Hi Joe, Eric &amp; other volks,
Please do not use this method of removing and reinstalling your pitman arm.
You will end up changing the geometery of the arm and could cause a binding of
the steering.  Instead remove one end of the drag link that is attatched to
the pit man arm and the center pin arm.  Then adjust the drag link shorter or
longer to get your steering wheel in the correct position with the wheels
straight.  Then before compleately tightening down the drag link check the
steering to make sure there are an even amount of turns to either side.  If
memory is correct it should be abot 3 1/3 turn from center to reach each of
right and left turns.  If the turns are correct, but the steering is off then
you might have to adjust the tie rods to get the last of the adjustments
right.  While you are doing all of this you really should check you toe in to
make sure it is correct.      Eric &amp; Barb
