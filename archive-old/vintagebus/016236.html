PLF (Peace, Love, Freedom) is a quality manufacturer
of correct canvas pieces for your bus.  The website is
http://www.plfvw_dot_com - She makes awesome repro tents,
awnings and such.  There have been a few people burned
by her on the list, much worse than what Dan has ever
done to anyone - so I'd recommend you not go to her if
your skin is not so thick.  I would venture to say
that there have been an equal number of people that
are quite pleased with the product she provides.  I
will be purchasing my repro tilt and tonneau cover
from her for my double cab when I get to that point in
the resto - if she's still in business.

Paul
