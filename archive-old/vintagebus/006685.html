 1965 356  C cars used these generators, they had an external regulator
mounted to the firewall (3&quot; by 6&quot; rectangle) ,also 912 up to 65 used them
then they went to the larger generator, as far as I know there was never a
12 volt generator with the regulator mounted on it, for a while Kymco in
Costa Mesa was making 12 generators with the reg mounted to it, but stopped
making them when he ran out of armatures, you could take it to a generator
shop and have them convert a 6 volt too 12 using parts from both, then all
you need to do is find a generator mounted 12 volt regulator, I'm sure they
are out there but I never looked, again check with Kymco on this, ask for
Ron or Jeff the owner and I'm sure they'll help you out. Also you could call
The Parts Shop in HB cali. they might have the generator and/or the
regulator you will need.

I have what i thought was a 12V 356 generator.
12V but with the smaller housing (Fits on a 36 horse case). Its got no place

to mount a voltage regulator like 6V generators, and instead of having the 
wires come up through a hole, there are two prongs that stick up like the
12V 
ones.
On the casing it is stamped:

0 101 266 029
EG &lt;- 7V50A28

If anyone can help me name this part, I would be GREATLY apreciated.
Regards, Greg
