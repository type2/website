&lt;&lt; Uhh, are you serious. Just keep the rear hatch door shut and you wont have 
a problem with exhaust in the bus. &gt;&gt;
Hi Mike,
Yes, deadly serious!  Case in point my Stap grand parents on my Step-mothers 
side  when thier children were kids they took a trip in thier USA big car.  
Got to thier destination and almost could not wake up the three kids in the 
back seat!  Turned out the muffler underside of the car was leaky and there 
was a pin hole under the rear seat to allow the higher pressure outside air 
and lower air pressure of the interior at highway speeds to push/suck the 
carbon monoxide in!  This while all doors closed!  All windows closed!   This 
is the reason VW did not just keep using the pre-1956 type 1 muffler or start 
using the later two tip and went to all the time and $ to design the bus type 
only muffler used from 1959-1/2 on up through 71.
Additional problem since our buses came off the assembly line is the lack of 
good engine lid to body seal today!  What is most often offered by seal 
suppliers is slightly better than installing pieces of garden hose.  Eric&amp;Barb
