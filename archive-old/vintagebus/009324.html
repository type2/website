Subject: Heating of a bus (Propane)

I have an idea.  I place it into the worthy hands of those with more
experience and engineering knowledge in hopes that if it could work, between
us we will come upon a solution to the problems of heating, air
breathability, efficiency, and safety.

Why not utilize radiant underfloor heating powered by a propane
burner/boiler and the state-of-the-art tubing provided by many companies for
home and industrial use?  A possible useful by-product would be hot water
for showers and dishwashing, etc.  The boiler could reside in the engine
compartment, probably on the left side where a gas heater usually lives,
vented to the outside, controlled from within, using either a
pilot light or (preferably) electric ignition and a thermostat.  If hot
water for other uses is not feasible or desired, the system could be sealed,
perhaps employing a liquid that has better thermodynamic properties than
water, thus leaving the only consumable to be the fuel:  Propane (or
gasoline?).  This would solve the asphyxiation and moisture problems;
however, how much energy would be consumed to heat a (presumably)
well-insulated bus interior?

And finally:  What would be the cost of parts and installation?
