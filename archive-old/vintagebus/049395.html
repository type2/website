made a trip to my favorite bone yard the other day and could not belive my eyes.the place has at least 10 splits and for years people would get what they needed and leave the rest for the next guy.it had been two years since i had gone to this place and it looks like a flock of buss ards attactked the place,doors on the ground and people just stepping on them, a real nice wety interior tottaly trashed ,the inside all splintered and the cabnets all screwed up.and it gets worse,please respect your fellow busser or is that a thing of the past?sorry to rant on but it just ain't right.																															paul 61 singlecab
