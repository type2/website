Ronnie asked:
Why is everyone seem to be so anti-Kustom?

Ellis says,
I'm not anti-Custom at all! I am anti-stupidity when
it comes to high prices on partially completed
vehicles or vehicles that have no business commanding
the type of prices that I have seen lately. It appears
to me that the efforts to pump the prices of
**everything** VW is beyond reason. Prices of rare,
intinsically valuable and/or well engineered new items
might be rational. Pumping the price of a POS 68
beetle with male cat urine interior and four douched
up fenders is uncalled for.

I am also anti-inconsistant_popular_opinion when it
comes to judging &quot;value&quot;. To say that the 23 window
panel with no interior, slammed to the ground, in
primer is worth 10 grand is nuts. No matter how
popular the good ole boy current owner is. Is the
engine a big dollar well executed piece or just a
piece? Has the suspension be altered to the degree of
professionalism that would be expected or just dropped
via the cheapest manner possible? Has the interior
been detailed with a killer sound system and some/any
kind of trearment that provides for &quot;Custom&quot; creature
comfort? If this, if that, if the other thoughts...
Yeah, whatever. If we all were young, smart, rich,
good looking and well hung then our lives just might
be a different story than what they happen to be.
Speculating on &quot;if&quot; is bull*hit.

If what is said is true then have the good ole boy
execute the nice looking and truly fun concept into a
spectacular example- then get it on the cover of the
Rollingstone THEN try to sell it for 10-40 thousand as
suggested. Otherwise it is a cool looking bus that
might be worth half of its currently debated prices.

To me it appears that folks are marketing &quot;concepts&quot;
of what might be IF another billion dollars and
similar number of hours labor are throw at the
projects.

I say give credit to and the big bucks to projects
like what Dr. Bob Davis is working on, give the
dollars to the consistantly killer inventory that Drew
keeps posting on VWPlanet, give it to the efforts of
Transporter Restorations, rare items like a 49 bug,
early cabriolet or a 52 bus, LennyC, any of the
BarnDeluxes as seen at the last June OCTO -or- a
professionally executed AND completed, well presented
and creative (non-thoughlessly cookiecutter) custom.
Dont give the huge dollars to the run of the mill
pieces of garbage.

Come on folks! Let's raise the bar here or call and
call a spade a spade. Or adjust your prices to what is
reasonably constituted.
