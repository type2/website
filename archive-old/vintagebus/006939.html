Ronne writ:
....
Always be cautious when buying new heads, there are 5 different head

manufacturers that I know of in Brazil and Mexico,

 
so are you aying that the VW/audi  logo on the head mean it comes from a 
better (approved?) manufacturerer/assembler?    some of the new heads have 
different logos, no \X/   or audi (how do you make an audi symbol on this 
keyboard?),  just the P/N and those  are the cheaper makers???     is it a 
different alloys?   cruddy casting?  I have heard different things about 
different new heads and seems everyone has a different opinion.

&lt; yes it is in the metal and the castings, some of the cheaper heads seem to
have a better casting (less flash) but it's the metallurgy in them that is
bad. It seems the heads with the VW/audi stampings in them have better metal
then those that don't, I have used all 5 manufacturers heads and have not
had problems with the Mexico and/or Brazil VW heads and have had pretty
decent luck with the Brazil aftermarket with the 3/4&quot; reach plug holes, the
aftermarket Mexico ones are terrible unless they improved their metal and
castings, as are the standard reach plug Brazilian heads. For the few dollar
difference I'd go with the better heads.
