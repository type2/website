Sounds like either a failing oil pump, or a blocked oil passage.  Did
you change the oil as part of the tune-up?  If so, did you use any
sort of liquid gasket material to seal around the drain plate?  If so,
my bet would be that some of the LG got inside the engine, has swirled
around, and settled into an oil passage somewhere.

The other probability is that airflow past the oil cooler has become
constricted/blocked.  You say there's nothing in the fan.  How strong
a breeze do you feel coming off of the left side of the motor,
compared to the right side?

Is there any oil leakage anywhere, particularly around the oil pump
(between the case and the rear pulley)?
