Hey All,

Hope everyone had a great weekend besides Dan:(  Made and interesting 
discovery while doing a valve adjustment...all 4 19mm boltes on my trailing 
arm by the RGB were loose!  This created the slop in shifting and low speeds 
in 2nd around turns that I thought would be cured when I changed to 
polyurethene tranny/engine mounts a few months back.  Good news is the 
drivetrain is tight!  Bad news is I've been cruising like that every day and 
a lot on the highway for atleast 4 months!  Weird thing is I'm under Sprout 
all the time and I never noticed it...I guess they coulda backed out 
recently making it more ovious!  CHECK YOUR BOLTS!  Anyway being less a 
Bentley can anyone give me the torque specs on those?

TIA,

Eric
