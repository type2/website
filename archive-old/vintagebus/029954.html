Mike,

The front beam swap is an age old conversion. If you didn't already know, the
beam from a 68-70 breadloaf/bay window/what ever you call them bolts straight
onto a split bus - this is good! The later beam has ball joints, so you can
fit
the disc brake set-up from a 72-79 bus, it just a bolt on item. The trick is
finding
a rust-free 68-70 front beam. Oh, and you need to change the master cylinder
for a later type if you are fitting disc brake as you need the pressure
release valve
type of master cylinder else your brake will seize after a reasonable journey.

You will also have to lower the 68- beam by a couple of inches to bring your
bus back down to the original height - bay windows are higher you see.

The back-end is a little harder. On my bus (the red/white one), I cut the
torsion
tube out of the chassis. Then cut the tube from a late bus, and welded it into
the
hole left in my chassis - basically I replaced the back suspension rather than

modifying it. You also need to remove the tranny cradle from your bus and fit
the
later pulley end engine support bay to the end of the chassis rails.

The side effects of this tranny swap is that the engine moves back about 3/4&quot;
and
accross to the battery side about 1/2&quot;. Also bay window track is wider so you
get
a wider track - important if you want to put fat wheels on it. Also you only
save
250revs/min with a late bus 1600 tranny, but you can use the 2ltr tranny which

has a high top ratio saving you more revs.

The simpler, but possibly more expensive way (depends if you do all your own
work) is to fit either the Bus Boys IRS or Straight Axle kit. With the IRS kit
you
can plug a high ratio tranny (such as GT Beetle) and do some get 70+ for
3000revs.
With the straight axle kit, you can use the original split trans (differential
reversed)
or any other straight axle tranny - I believe. This method gives you a 4&quot;+
drop at
the rear by default - good if you like to mow the grass : )

Lee.
