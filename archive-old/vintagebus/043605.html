&gt;[...] the headlight relay clicks with the brights but no headlights ever 
&gt;come on.

The relay lives between the headlight switch and the headlight fuses
and is powered by the headlight switch, so you know it's working at
least up to the relay.  Make sure the bulbs are good...

&gt;She's clogged, so I pulled the tank out.  I plan on cleaning it with 
&gt;the pressure washer this weekend.

My Dad's '74 Bug, which sat for a few years after Grandma stopped 
driving it, was plugged up bad at the tank outlet pipe.  I had to
unscrew that big nut and work over the pipe with carb cleaner and
a piece of wire to get it clear.  That screen up inside was nasty,
too.  Just something else to check while you have it open.

&gt;Remaining things I'm not sure about are how to test the oil and gen light 
&gt;circuits without an engine

Turn the key on and ground the wire of interest back in the engine
compartment - associated light should come on.

&gt;and being uncertain of what is what, given the condition in the 
&gt;engine compartment (ideas?)

Well, on my '64, all the tail-light stuff comes up through the floor
at the brace between the engine compartment opening and the right rear
tail light, in back of the battery.  It goes up, breaks out for the
right tail light, up and across the top of the compartment, breaking
out for the license light, and back halfway down the left side for the
tail light over there.  The positive battery cable has its own hole
in the right front of the engine compartment; all the other wires
(oil light, generator light, feed to coil, and main wire off of
regulator) go through another hole in the right front of the engine
compartment.  Underneath, near the starter, the single bundle from
the front along the right frame rail breaks out for the starter,
the wires that go into the engine compartment, and the tail light
wires - the tail light wires continue along the frame rail and then
come up through the engine compartment floor as above.

You should really only have three or maybe four wires in the
&quot;engine&quot; bundle - oil light, generator light, coil feed, and maybe
back-up lights.

Good luck!
