Subject: Re: Center Brake Lights

My Dealer VW parts book lists center brake light up to chas # 351735
which falls somewhere at end of 57 early 58. My 58 Binz chas # 343475
has a center b/l and after sanding decklid it is the original ivory
paint as rest of truck. It does have the high taillights and there was
on wiring that i can find to the center b/l only for the lin. light.
My theory it that VW used up what was left over at end of each model
year and put on next years buses until supply ran out. My binz also has
an earier body number ( # 317249 ) so that could have something to do
with it.
