&gt; later in the afternoon my truck was test-fitted for a tilt that tom
buese's is making.  this is the first single cab tilt he has made so after
the test fit on my truck he should be able to go into production with them.
he is in full production mode with double cab tilts now.  the test tilt sure
looked great on my truck; i was sorry that it was only a prototype model!
