&gt; &lt;&lt; What has the better chance of getting a seized plug out and saving the
&gt;  threads...   Cold engine, warm engine, hot engine??? &gt;&gt;
&gt; Hi Andy,
&gt; Probably best to just have it a bit warm after starting and running it about 
&gt; 5 minutes.  Aluminum of the head and other parts of the engine swell in size 
&gt; faster than the steel parts.  So the threaded hole will probably be bigger 
&gt; than the spark plug when just warmed up a bit.  

OTOH, the head will also grow in the axial direction of the plug faster
than the plug itself, so it will be tighter when hot. 

&gt;   If that does not work try a hammer and punch to shock the plug into 
&gt; releasing the head threads.  Next time you remove your spark plugs use 
&gt; graphite (Pencil lead) to lubricate the threads of the plug or at least some 
&gt; good quality anti-sieze material.

Good advice. be very careful to keep the anti-sieze material away from the
electrodes and insulator.

If you have a plug that is stubborn about coming out (gets harder to turn
while removing), don't try to force it.  Turn it in a bit, turn it out a
bit more, in, out, etc.  This will wear down the carbon deposits a bit at
a time and save the threads.  This doesn't work retroactively, though!
