&gt;Has anyone heard of an _intake_ valve stretching or rapid intake valve

I had #4 intake valve stretch on a good 1600DP engine. Over three valve
adjustments the gap was always closed. Then one day the head of #4 intake
valve broke off at 60mph and destroyed the engine in about three seconds.

If a particular valve gap keeps closing up, take that as a warning that
that valve is about to fail. Pull the engine immediately and rebuild the
heads.
