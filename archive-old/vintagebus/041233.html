&gt;or energy lost focused at another battle.  I guess the spacer is the real
&gt;question here.  Will a one inch spacer between my manifold and carb to clear my
&gt;alternator drastically affect my motors performance?  The Idea of bending my
&gt;manifold,or switching to a generator is not an option.  Please advise.
&gt;
&gt;If the one inch spacer is a no-go, and I decide not to fix what's not broke,
&gt;then anyone want to buy a real cheap slightly used and slightly reamed PICT-34? 
&gt;I'll even throw in a one inch spacer for free!

Hi George,
If it's any consolation ;-) my bus has a spacer on it just like the one you describe.  I'm running a 1500 with a 009, alternator and a 34pict carb.  That's how I bought the motor and I haven't had any problems with it at all in a year of driving it around.  Mind you, it's possible that some of the acceleration problems (at high altitudes and on steep hills) I've blamed on the IRS beetle tranny are in part due to this combination.  I did get to test drive it in another bus before I bought it though, and it seemed to accelerate really quick and smooth.
I guess I'll find out for sure when I put this motor into the 66 with stock tranny I'm getting in May.
Until then, I guess this is my indecisive opinion.
