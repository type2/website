Hi,

So there is no joy in the house of Nate. Having said that, perhaps all is
not lost.
Two quick question. 1) where are you and 2) What kinda bus is in question
here?
Obviously you have worked hard on this bus and there may still be some value
in it.

More questions.
Engine and tranny running?
Front beam solid?
Wheels tires and brakes all in order?
How about body parts:doors mirrors glass?
Interior in decent shape?
Is it a camper?
Why am I asking you all these questions?

So the frame is rotten and Kelly Brown (MetWiz) might be able to indicate if
it is feasible to replace the rusty stuff. If it cant be replaced then find
a bus of the same or most compatible year that has a blown engine or has
been stripped out.

Even if this sounds overly idealistic I can testify that there is 71 with a
blown motor at a garage here in town that the owner cannot afford to fix.
There is a '72 in the junkyard that is my favorite donor and I always wonder
why it was forsaken. I am sure that there must be others out there with
decent bodies but no running gear. It will take sometime to find the right
one and do the switch but It is worth a try!

Let the list know what you have and what you need and maybe this bad deal
can be turned around.

Best wishes to you!!!

&gt;        The reason I post this today, is yesterday, after $850 for a non
&gt;running bus, around $1000 in parts, 7 months of fixing in snow, sleet,
&gt;rain, and hail and gallons of blood sweat and tears, I was told that she
&gt;won't now, and never will pass inspection because of a rusty frame.
&gt;PLEASE don't make the same mistake I did.
&gt;
&gt;End of rant,
&gt;Nate
