Subject: Re: Shift rod bushes

&gt;From: &lt;paul_f_at_ntlworld_dot_com&gt;

&gt;
&gt;When fitting the bushes that are like shuttle cocks, should I fit only the
&gt;rear bush, insert the rod into the tube and slide it far enough forward to
&gt;fit the front bush from the front, or should I fit both and squash the
&gt;front bush by hand so that it goes into the shift rod tube?

I'm not sure if this is what you're asking, but I semi-recently replaced
the front bush (right under the gear shift) only on my '64.  At first I
tried it with the shift rod in place, trying to squeeze the bushing in
between the rod and the bracket so the groove in the center would go into
the bracket.  That didn't work; I couldn't even squeeze it enough to get
the first groove (for the retaining clip) through the bracket.  I pulled
the front rod out, put the bush in the bracket, and slid the rod back in -
no problem.
