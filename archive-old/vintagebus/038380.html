&quot;Good deed Rewarded with extreme prejudice&quot;

Renton, Washington 6:18pm -- In an unplanned announcement, Stephen Gutknecht
-- spokesman for the search team, proclaims that &quot;Crew Cab Search 1998&quot; has
completed with success.  Experts are stunned, as estimates had been that
this breakthrough would take months to reach.

&quot;Rex Eastman not only located a complete Crew Cab at a show today, he
purchased it and closed the deal with his own money.  It met budget
requirements, and is a rust-free California Bus.  I haven't even met Rex
yet, all I did was take some pictures of a 23-window Deluxe.  I'm stunned at
this great development.&quot;

Early details include model year, 1961.  Other details are not yet know, as
Rex Eastman was severely overcome by &quot;in-hurry syndrome&quot; in this VW rescue.
Reports are that he was rushed to a LA VW show and will be in treatment
until late Sunday night.
