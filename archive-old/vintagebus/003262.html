Speaking of weird engine numbers ... I just noticed my engine that is now
complete has one of those recycled numbers. Before you say &quot;yah yah heard
that one already&quot;...the number is as follows.....
B.
thats it.
VW recycle symbol then &quot;B&quot;. No, the rest is not ground off or altered. just
forgot to stamp the rest i guess? MY 36 horse case is like &quot;recycle
3060845X&quot; or something so i know its not a question of early case numbers.
anyone got a recylced case reference guide for years? or does that exist, or
if it does would it be utterly useless?
Kinda ironic how my Single cab is named &quot;Bastard&quot; and my case number/letter
turns out to be B......
-wade- *gets out his number punches to finish off the rest of the case
number*
57 SC bastard
