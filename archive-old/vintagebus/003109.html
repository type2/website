  Hi busvolks, my friend has a '66 Kombi that has a swing axle bug tranny installed by a PO.
 It has 14&quot; bus rims all around but the rear tires rub against the spring plates.  What tire rim 
 combo would fit?  He would like to keep the rims stock, maybe use a bug rim even.  Sorry I 
 don't remember what tire is on there now.
 TIA
