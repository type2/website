Well everyone - the city is hassling me again over my bus.  I have an
'unregistered vehicle' that has been on the property for more than 21 days
so I have 21 days to remove it, put it behind an enclosure, or get a fined
$100 per day I'm in violation - Social Democracy at its finest.  I haven't
been able to work on the bus because of the engine fiasco that you are all
aware of.  Just when the chips are up, they go down again.  I would expect
this behavior in Beverly Hills but not in hick town Beatrice, NE.

Anyway, I can't even get the bus registered because an out of state vehicle
has to be inspected before allowing it to be licensed and tagged.  Since it
is not in running shape yet, I can't pass inspection therefore I can't get
it tagged.

So I can do one of 2 things - I can either put up a couple more fence panels
(which I have) and hide it in the backyard or
I can really piss off a bunch of people by painting this thing up, calling
it art, and really stir up a hornets nest (which I would love to do.)  Is
there a precedence that I can follow in this regard?  I'd hate to paint up
my bus with all the flowers and all, call it my &quot;artistic expression of the
VW auto world&quot; and still get fined and hornswaggled by the city.  Are my
chances very good that if I pursue the 1st admendment, the city, out of
abiding by Federal Law and out of frustration, would leave me alone?

One more note - there are 2 other auto restorers within a couple blocks of
me and they've left vehicles out on the street for more than 24 hours and
when I do, I get warnings whereas they leave their stuff sit for weeks.  I'm
not as rich as them either so money plays a part in it as well.

Anyway, for now, I'm gonna put up a fence panel and keep it in the backyard
until I get the engine done but man, this gets really really old.  When I
drag the bus out again to work on it, I'll get another letter so I'm gonna
have to do something different.

Thanks for the ideas...
