Subject: Re: [VB] logic of gas line routing

I have to agree about the gas line routing...I have more than once gotten
gasoline into my eyes, despite wearing safety goggles!  I hate that thing
:-)  Just can't seem to get it plugged/back on fast enough.

Anyway, I think I'll try running the line on the '67 through the body as
you're thinking the next time I play the engine pull game.  It would make
engine R&amp;I much cleaner and less hazardous and I don't think it'll detract
at all from the appearance.  Just put a shut-off behind the new hole...hmm.
I want to try it!  I can't think of any possible problems as long as I throw
a grommet into the new hole.  Heck, and one of the POs cut a hole for a BN4
cable already, so I can use that one!

&gt;
&gt; So this has been bugging me since the first time I ever pulled an
&gt; engine:  Why does the fuel line run through the engine tin, instead of
&gt; through a hole in the body next to it?
