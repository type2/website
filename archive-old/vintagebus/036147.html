I have a rear seat w/ original carmael brown
upholstery. That places it in the '58 - 61 standard
bus interior range. I want to sell it. What years will
it fit? It was in my '67, so I figure it will go that
late, but how early will it go? TIP: the driver's side
leg is bent in (towards bus center) at the bottom back
before it rises up in front of the
hump/firewall/slope/thingy. What;s up with that?  I
need to know so I can tell potential buyers what year
will go. (anyone want it? $200)

sounds like it will fit 3/55 through early severties.    Barndoor seats 
attache different.   then sometime in the mid 70s (74?) they changed the way 
the back part of the seat folds down, and the earlier kinds do not fit and 
attach easily (but the bottom of the rear set still does.)  But seeing as you 
are asking a fairly high price it sound like you are looking for someone who 
wants a real nice seat for their 58-61  micro.
