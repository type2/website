List
I know this is a long shot but what the heck I figure someone may have one
and need some extra cash or parts.
I am looking for a older westy tent (the large one) for my 61 flip seat. I
am willing to consider everything available though my preference would be
the more common color combo of yellow and gray. I have cash and / or parts
for trading (Example of parts are; complete crewcab tilt, 62-63 only full
middle seat, 64 to 67 3/4 middle seat. single wheel trailer, early jail
bars, etc..). Please let me know if you have a tent for sale.
Thanks
