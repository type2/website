&gt;I guess I should clarify. I am looking for the female crimp-on connectors
&gt;thahook directly to your switches, tail lights ect.

Most of the ones you find, as you have probably discovered, are bright
plated and have the plastic barrels on them.  Most good hardware stores
#include &lt;hardware-store-rant.h&gt; will sell ones without the plastic
barrels but they're still usually bright plated.  I think most of these
are nickel over brass/copper or maybe tin over brass/copper.

I have found the real brass ones in a _few_ hardware stores.  Prowl
around the local Ace and True Value stores, especially the small and
grungy-looking ones, but prepare to be disappointed.

I'm almost sure that there is a reliable supplier of these to the vintage
car market but I don't know offhand who it is.  Maybe Hemmings Motor News
would be a good place to check.
