Subject: RE: [VB] Backup lights on 67 deluxe

There were some early '67s that did not have backup
lights.  As usual with VW, they occasionally made
changes when they needed to.  I almost bought a 67
Kombi (I think it was a September or October one) that
did not have back up lights.  It was all original, and
the corners were in very good, unrestored condition. 
This was either a dealer add-on or a customer &quot;hack&quot;
to bring the bus up to safety standards.

OTOH, I've seen a '66 with the correct later lights
that the owner claimed we original.  The lights may
have been original, but they most likely didn't come
on that bus originally.  

All this applies to US-destined buses.  I have no idea
about other contries.

&gt; Do you have the normal ones for a '67?  Any one know
&gt; if VW was consistent on
&gt; this?

&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Remember, I am new to this stuff:
&gt; I have been watching close at backup light
&gt; configurations, and I have not
&gt; seen this on anyone's yet. Is this a special setup,
&gt; or am I just not finding
&gt; anything similar.
&gt; I have this one in good condition, the other is
&gt; busted. I have replacement
&gt; brake lights, but the white backup light, is it
&gt; unusual or just not used
&gt; anymore?
