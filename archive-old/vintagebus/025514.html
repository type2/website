Hell yes - the benevolent brother (and sister) hood of bumbling bus bravados is
a most excellent idea!  Count me in.  I'm a fair wrench for the most part, can
take the time to help, and love busses.  Also, there may come a time where I'd
have to call on such a resource.  We members of the BMW Motorcycle owners of
America have a similar gig going.  I haven't had to use the resource for
repairs, but it's cool to pull into a strange town and be able to call on
someone with a similar interest - kinda like I hear AA is.
