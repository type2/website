Subject: RE: [VB] Anyone using a B4 in their Bus

&gt; &gt; &gt; Anyone using a B4 gasheater in there Bus, Split or Bay?  Does
&gt; &gt; &gt; it heat the Bus OK on 30 degree days?

&gt; I meant BA4, sorry



This unit was sold as a &quot;heater booster&quot; for the 411/412 car, and is an
excellent unit. However  it is not really designed for an interior as
large as a bus. It will work acceptably at 30 degrees but will have a
hard time at 20 degrees.  This assumes that your heat exchangers,
piping, etc. are in good condition so it's starting with warm air to
begin with. The larger BA6 used on later Busses and Vanagons is almost a
drop-in replacement for the BA4, so you could wire the BA4 now and
replace it with a higher-BTU BA6 heater body if you find one later. One
note: there are many ancilliary parts of the BA4 that are not directly
attached to the unit - i.e. sensors, relays, and switches under the
vehicle and behind the dash - that are crucial to its operation.  Make
sure you have everything that goes with it. 

Linked from www.type2_dot_com you can find a scan of a BA4 service manual
that I provided some years ago, and there is lots of info in the
archives from other users. As with any gas heater, test/install it
carefully. When I put a BA4 in one of my busses, I used the info in the
service manual to assemble, test, and actually run the heater on the
ground next to the bus first, to make sure everything worked properly,
and then installed it. Much easier than trying to adjust and
troubleshoot it while lying on your back under the bus (assuming you're
mounting it underneath as a BA6 would be mounted).
