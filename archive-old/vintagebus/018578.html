Thanks, E&amp;B
However, now I'm a bit confused. I'll send you a picture of a '67 bus
compartment straight from a sales brochure. (I ripped it off of a listmember's
website. I can't for the life of me remember who it was.  Could this person
provide a link for people here?) This picture shows the paper preheat hose
entering the tin on the left side of the engine to get air from the #4
cylinder, not the right side to get air from the #2 cylinder.  Is the '67 a
one year arrangement in that earlier vehicles had the hose on the right hand
side?

Is the &quot;J&quot; part there to make the tube stick straight up instead of at an
angle like what happens with the straight tube?

I hope this stuff isn't too mundane for everyone!

Any help would be appreciated!

&lt;&lt; What does the preheat tube connect to? Is it a &quot;J&quot; shaped thing right 
under
the tin? If so, how does it bolt onto the car? &gt;&gt;
Hi Paul,
Depends! The 40 HP version is short, straight and attaches to the rear left 
head exhaust stud and thru the small lower tin to the rear of the #4 
cylinder. 1300 - 1500 tube is longer and shaped like a J, which is attached 
to one of the rear right head exhaust studs and thru the small lower tin 
piece to the rear of #2 cylinder.
