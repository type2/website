Subject: Re: [VB] Brosol, how bad?

I dunno why people dump on Brosol carbs.  I've had one (the same one) on my 
bug for ten years.

I don't like 34-picts, but that is because if they go bad they are a PITA to 
clean out so I put a sp cab on w/ adaptor.  

But... if it isn't broken, no need to fix it.  Don't worry about it, as long 
as the gas isn't leaking or anything.

 I've been seeing messages fly past from time to time commenting on the 
quality of the Brosol carbs.
 
 I was going through the 1600DP that came with my '65 DC and lo' and behold, 
I've got a 34 pict-3
 Brosol carb on it. How bad are they? Is it bad enough that I should look 
into replacing it?
