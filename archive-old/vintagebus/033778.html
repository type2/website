that is May of 63, it's a 63 model.
. .. . . . . .. . . .  .. . 
it came with some grey interior panels and a grey back seat. but a como green
middle seat. and como green sun visors. but no headlinder seems like it was
como green and was worth something so they took it out.

it was probably sealing wax red/beige grey- look in the door jambs- this came
with the grey interior panels and seats/sunvisiors.    If it was
turquoise/blue white, it came with the green interior panels seats/sunvisors.
Someone took parts from another bus, as usually has happens.  The headliner
was almost certainly the cloth, and may well have been removed as it was tatty
and faling apart.   Vinyl was listed as a option (mcode type) at that time,
but I have never seen a vinyl headliner in a bus before they became stock.
. . . . . . . .. .  . . . . .
 and there is a sticker that says:
seeblau 360
cumuluswie8 680

not sure if the sticker is stock cause the bench seat portion has been cut out
then welded back in. messed up. stuff.

sounds like the metal partition  came out of a 66 or 67 deluxe.
. . . ..  ..   .. 
well now the bus is stripped no windows no interior. next step motor, steering
column/wheel, gagues.

But...
   i am wondering whether to Sand Blast, Bead Blast, or grind and sand.  

bead blasting sounds the best but the grinding and sanding is defenitly
cheapest.
remember im only 17 working 2 jobs to support my collection.

speaking of corner windows.  I need 1 both the ones in there were bad. damn
kids with bee-bee guns.  i have 1 good spare.  I NEED ANOTHER ONE.

How much rust is there?  Do you have access to a air compressor?   A
longboard?  is it strip, prep and paint, or is a certain amount of
reconstructive surgery needed?  sounds like a lot of work, but when it is done
it'll all be worth it.
