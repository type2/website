Subject: Paint

Just a note on the various paint / rust / POR-15 threads...

Pages 15 and 16 of Seume's &quot;VW Bus&quot; book shows how Buses were
originally painted.  After welding the whole bodyshell was dipped
in something to clean it (I'd guess a mild acid) and then dipped
in a &quot;phosphate solution&quot; for anti-oxidizing.  I don't know if
this was meant to be a long-term thing or just something to keep
the rust off until it got painted, but I thought it might be
interesting to know.
