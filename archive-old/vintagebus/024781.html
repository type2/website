I was wondering if someone out there could help out with this....... I
was wondering if anyone would know the thickness, and dimensions of the
plywood floor, in a 66 Westfalia.......  I am helping a friend fix his
up, and we have no pattern to work from....... we would like to know how
far it extends under the Z-bed....

Thanks,
