    Yes, Jerome Jamboree articles have been printed in both (I think) major 
magazines.  However, that has only been because someone like Jerry Jess has 
sent in stories/photos.  In fact I think that Jerry has sent in an article 
fore most, if not all of the Jerome Jambories.  One year there was even an 
article printed that was submitted by someone the ABC board didn't even know. 
 Not that there was anything wrong with that.  

    The point is that the magazines themselves refuse to cover Jerome 
Jamboree and many other rather large events, simply because......well, I'm 
not sure why!  There have been several vendors come to Jerome who have said 
that they made little if anything, but will be at all of them just because of 
what it is and how much fun they had.  It's more of a small vacation for 
them, than anything else. We have run out of ideas on how to convince the 
mags. of this, and as far as I know the club still refuses to put ANYONE up 
in a hotel.  The whole purpose of Jerome Jamboree, or any other event of its 
type, is everything that goes on at a &quot;mass campout&quot;.

Anyway, sorry for the rambling.....
