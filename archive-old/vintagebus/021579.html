Subject: 1st Binz trip, Mt. Rushmore &amp; Springfield, MO meet
Message-ID: &lt;25edb05d.248f340b_at_aol_dot_com&gt;

To all the midwest show regulars (and anyone else who cares 8-)

I'll be missing this years show in Springfield, Mo so everyone else will have 
a chance at the swap meet this year 8-)  I'll be heading up to Mt. Rushmore 
with the Volkswagen Club of Nebraska.  The Rushmore trip sounds like a blast. 
 We will be stopping at Car Henge (A Nebraska farmers version of Stone Henge) 
and a VW Salvage yard along the way.  There will be a few 36hp cars on the 
trip up there so I should be able to keep up.  This will be the first out of 
town trip in the Binz since I have owned it and installed the new engine.  
I'll be headed out tomorrow - Wish me well!
