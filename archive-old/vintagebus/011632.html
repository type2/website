Rex Rogers asks:

&gt;&gt;    My '59 has been mostly converted to a 12volt system. One of the only
&gt;&gt;     things left is the 6volt wiper motor. While weighing my options, I

[snip]

&gt;&gt;   Would the wiper frame &amp; transmission be the same thing for all years of
&gt;&gt;   Baywindow Buses?
                                      
No.  Early bus wiper motors are mounted on a small plate only slight larger 
than the motor itself, and are connected to the separate wiper shafts using 
thin rods and ball joints.  Later busses use an integrated frame made out of
stamped steel, which included the wiper shafts and linkage all in one unit. 

I don't recall for sure when the change was made, but I'd speculate that it 
was one of many that were inaugurated in mid-1963.  My '61 Microbus uses the 
separate linkage, while my '65 Deluxe uses the larger frame with everything
built in to the unit.

I modified a 12 volt motor from another vehicle to use in my '61.  I _think_ 
that I used a motor from a '67 beetle, but it's been so many years now that I 
don't recall for sure.  The 12 volt motor is two speed, so I got a wiper switch 
from a later year bus.

The motor itself is physically the same as the original one, except that the 
crank on the motor shaft stops in a different position.  It's pressed onto the 
shaft and peened in place by machine.  I removed the crank and repositioned it
so that the wipers would stop where I wanted them to.  This requires one or
more careful trial fittings.

Peening the crank to the shaft by hand using a hammer and prick punch was
ineffective, so I very carefully brazed it in place.  You have to be careful
not to cook the innards of the motor when you're doing this --- it seems to me 
that I used a small pair of needle nose Vise-Grips as a heat sink on the shaft.
A MIG welder would be a much better way to go if you have access to one. 

Cheers, Bill
