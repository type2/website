&gt; Has this ever happened to you?
&gt; 
&gt; I parked my 21 window bus (DARTHVW - black bus with
&gt; red beltline and &quot;V&quot;) at the public lot at the beach.
&gt; Spent the whole day out on the beach, far away from my
&gt; bus, but never thought about it and never worried. Had
&gt; an amazing time! I ran into this group of girls who
&gt; were the cheerleaders way back in high school. We
&gt; caught up on old times and they all seemed pretty
&gt; interested in what I was up to now-a-days. We even
&gt; ended up having dinner together down there. 

&lt;snip&gt;

&gt; THEN I WOKE UP!!!
