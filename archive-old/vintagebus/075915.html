&gt; Is there people out there that repair these things? That might also be an 
&gt; option.

Hi Ray,
Try Hollywood Speedo in the LA area.  Cost for repair is about $125.00, or 
you can try the Yellow pages for other places that do gauge repair.  There 
was a shop in 
Portland area that did the repairs for about half of Hollywood Speedo.
