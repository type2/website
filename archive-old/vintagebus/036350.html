Subject: new addition to my stable
Message-ID: &lt;7lmkfk$ejb4_at_eGroups_dot_com&gt;

just purchased a 1959 standard microbus. rock solid, no rust, straight
as an arrow. dash uncut. arizona bus. light green over dark green. down
side is wheel wells cut, no title, aftermarket steering wheel,no middle
or rear seat,not a problem. here's the kicker. this little cream puff
set me back a total of $300. don't mean to boast but life is good here
in the desert south west of arizona. my intentions are to turn this bus
into a hatch top psuedo westy. it ain't authentic but it works for me.
my time frame for production to start is approximately sept 1.
currently i'm in the middle of a 1965 double cab bone stock resto. if
things go as planned the double cab should be done by jerome jamboree
time. the '59 resto should be completed by buses by the bridge IV. hope
to have the complete stable on display for BBB IV, GOD willin' &amp; the
river don't rise. thanks for listening. terry delaney
