if you can find a copy of a bus parts list, you can reference these things 
yourself.     I know that Steve Howell had made some copies, and they were 
available to listtees for an extremely reasonable cost.  It really is as 
helpful as the Bentley in fixing your VW, and impresses people went you tell 
them what you want and supply the VW part number.

them,

 Well sh*t.  That's kind of a bummer, because they lost out on a rebuild,
 and I gave away my axles thinking they were not usable.  It's been an
 expensive summer.  Oh well, live and learn.  I guess I'm going to remember
 REAL good that all axles from after barndoors to 67 are the same.  Not one
 of lifes great lessons, but a good thing to know if you drive old buses.:)
 Thanks Clara.
