Subject: Re: [T2] RE: [VB] Re: [T2] first drive single port dog house

Hello Guys and Dolls    First which single port? not 25hp,or 36hp. 40hp 
easier, 50hp yes , any 1600 sure  the differences is that the old heads had a 
plate in them for the rod to  go thur. New heads don't have this plate that I 
have seen. You would have trouble with the 40( 1200cc) cause of the width. I 
just measured a old stlye housing verus the later dog house style and theres 
no difference where the rod hooks or comes out of the housing. I don't think 
someone is holding their mouth just right!  Later and have fun  Mark Dearing
