Bob is correct in pointing out that I must have mis interpreted
something from the archives.  When I replied to the original post I
misquoted from memory.  I use an oil cooler setup described in the
sermons.  I added the oil filter believing some filtration is better
than no filtering.  If there's outstanding reasons why a filter inline
with the external oil cooler is a bad idea I'd love to hear them.  So
far I've had no troubles.  Alternative ideas to the setup I'm running
are welcome!

I apologize if I created any confusion and many apologies to Bob for
misquoting him.  Time to buy the sermons CD!

Dave
