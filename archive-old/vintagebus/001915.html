Also there was evidently one other rubber seal, this one is much thicker
but it was laying in the bottom of the vent compartment utterly mangled so
I have no idea where it went. Any ideas?

Although I never completed this job, I had always planned on doing it to my
last bus (Dixie, a '65 Standard).  To my recollection, there are two rubber
sealing parts and a leatherette kind of thing.

The two rubber seals are the one you mention on the flapper to turn the air
flow on and off and a second one (similar to a door seal) in a metal channel
for the flapper to seat against.  In Dixie, the metal channel had come
un-spot welded, but was still in the vent box waiting re-attachment.

The leatherette thingy is attached to the air direction control and either
flaps over the side (front) outlet to send the air to the back, or closes
across the vent box to block air from the rear and send it to the front.  If
my memory serves, if this thing is gone, the direction control will rotate
freely, if it is at least partially there, the control will only rotate 90
degrees.

Don't know of an easy repair for the rubber on the flapper.  For Dixie, I
had picked up an extra flapper that I hoped to rebuild as you mentioned, but
never got around to it before Dixie went to bus heaven.

Good luck,
terry &amp; Sunshine ('64 Westy)
