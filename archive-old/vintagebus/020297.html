I'm still on the fence as to whether I will go, but if I do, I'd go down
Friday, sleep over, then drive back Saturday afternoon.  The last time
I went down, I didn't find any value-add in going to the classic, and it
was pretty much the same buses as the day before.   All the good stuff
went at the OCTO swap, 'cept on Sunday there was everthing from BenWah
balls to dish soap; don't need to drive 20 hours round trip for that...

&gt; Could I get anyone interested in meeting for pictures of list people at the
&gt; OCTO and the Classic? I know we go each year, and I always regret not
&gt; meeting all these people that I read each day. Maybe this year...
