As I was working on my headliner, I found two wires, inside original housing
tucked in the rear driver's side roof corner of the bus.  They appear to
have always been there but never used.  They have the little metal endcap
things except with no indentations where the screws would have clamped down
on them.  I've looked on wiring diagrams to figure it out and to no avail. 
anyone have any clue as to why they were there?

for the radio speakers you didn't have i the little bracket in the rear 
corners.   My 61 deluxe has this wire.  The front end is in the radio area.  
I hooked up speakers back there, to my stylee 8 track stereo.      I have the 
impression they were  put in deluxes about that time, not sure if in other 
models.  Is yours a deluxe?
