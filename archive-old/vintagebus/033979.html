HELP!

I have a Reduction Box Stub Axle that has been
mutilated by the PO to the point where the threads
just don't exist.

Does any one know how to fix this?

Does any on have an axle they would be willing
to sell?

It is from my '64 Standard and is the last thing
keeping me from putting it back together.
