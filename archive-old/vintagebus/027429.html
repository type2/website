Subject: 6v gas gauge, 12v car.

Hey all,

I've seen a couple posts now regarding this.  I run a 6v gauge in my 12v
car with no voltage drop at all.  The gauge works fine, it says full
when it's full. and empty when it's empty.  It does bounce around a lot
when it's about 1/2 full, but I attribute this to my sender unit.  I've
been led to believe that since the gauge only measures resistance it
doesn't matter what voltage it's using.  I'm no expert so don't flame
me, but I've been using this setup now for 3 years now with no probs.

BTW, I still have the metal parts of a westy Z bed.  The wood is gone,
but I also have the cushions.  Anyone interested? I live in Ventura, Ca
