I think Ron's offer at the Bus Depot is a great idea.  Hats off to Ron for
making the offer in the first place and a double hats off for still being
willing to do it.  I see no down side to the list...Ron has the down side by
making all of the arrangements.  Kudos also to Ted for his apology.  I am
sure every one of us has said something that was either taken in the wrong
context or was just said to quickly.  All water under the bus in my opinion.
On with life!
