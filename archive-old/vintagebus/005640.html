&gt; &gt; &gt; Subject: Canadian Editorial about USA
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Please read and forward, as Americans we need to continue to
stand and
&gt; &gt; &gt; be
&gt; &gt; &gt; proud of our great country.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; This, from a Canadian newspaper, is worth sharing.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; America: The Good Neighbor.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Widespread but only partial news coverage was given recently to
a
&gt; &gt; &gt; remarkable
&gt; &gt; &gt; editorial broadcast from Toronto by Gordon Sinclair, a Canadian
&gt; &gt; &gt; television
&gt; &gt; &gt; commentator. What follows is the full text of his trenchant
remarks as
&gt; &gt; &gt; printed in the Congressional Record:
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;This Canadian thinks it is time to speak up for the Americans
as the
&gt; &gt; &gt; most
&gt; &gt; &gt; generous and possibly the least appreciated people on all the
earth.
&gt; &gt; &gt; Germany, Japan and, to a lesser extent, Britain and Italy were
lifted
&gt; &gt; &gt; out
&gt; &gt; &gt; of the debris of war by the Americans who poured in billions of
dollars
&gt; &gt; &gt; and
&gt; &gt; &gt; forgave other billions in debts. None of these countries is
today paying
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; even the interest on its remaining debts to the United States.
When
&gt; &gt; &gt; France
&gt; &gt; &gt; was in danger of collapsing in 1956, it was the Americans who
propped it
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; up, and their reward was to be insulted and swindled on the
streets of
&gt; &gt; &gt; Paris. I was there. I saw it. When earthquakes hit distant
cities, it is
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; the United States that hurries in to help. This spring, 59
American
&gt; &gt; &gt; communities were flattened by tornadoes. Nobody helped. The
Marshall
&gt; &gt; &gt; Plan
&gt; &gt; &gt; and the Truman Policy pumped billions of dollars into
discouraged
&gt; &gt; &gt; countries. Now newspapers in those countries are writing about
the
&gt; &gt; &gt; decadent, warmongering Americans. I'd like to see just one of
those
&gt; &gt; &gt; countries that is gloating over the erosion of the United States
dollar
&gt; &gt; &gt; build its own airplane. Does any other country in the world have
a plane
&gt; &gt; &gt; to
&gt; &gt; &gt; equal the Boeing Jumbo Jet, the Lockheed Tri-Star, or the
Douglas DC10?
&gt; &gt; &gt; If
&gt; &gt; &gt; so, why don't they fly them? Why do all the International lines
except
&gt; &gt; &gt; Russia fly American Planes? Why does no other land on earth even
&gt; &gt; &gt; consider
&gt; &gt; &gt; putting a man or woman on the moon? You talk about Japanese
technocracy,
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; and you get radios. You talk about German technocracy, and you
get
&gt; &gt; &gt; automobiles. You talk about American technocracy, and you find
men on
&gt; &gt; &gt; the
&gt; &gt; &gt; moon - not once, but several times - and safely home again. You
talk
&gt; &gt; &gt; about
&gt; &gt; &gt; scandals, and the Americans put theirs right in the store window
for
&gt; &gt; &gt; everybody to look at. Even their draft-dodgers are not pursued
and
&gt; &gt; &gt; hounded.
&gt; &gt; &gt; They are here on our streets, and most of them, unless they are
breaking
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Canadian laws, are getting American dollars from ma and pa at
home to
&gt; &gt; &gt; spend
&gt; &gt; &gt; here. When the railways of France, Germany and India were
breaking down
&gt; &gt; &gt; through age, it was the Americans who rebuilt them. When the
&gt; &gt; &gt; Pennsylvania
&gt; &gt; &gt; Railroad and the New York Central went broke, nobody loaned them
an old
&gt; &gt; &gt; caboose. Both are still broke. I can name you 5000 times when
the
&gt; &gt; &gt; Americans
&gt; &gt; &gt; raced to the help of other people in trouble. Can you name me
even one
&gt; &gt; &gt; time
&gt; &gt; &gt; when someone else raced to the Americans in trouble? I don't
think there
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; was outside help even during the San Francisco earthquake. Our
neighbors
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; have faced it alone, and I'm one Canadian who is damned tired of
hearing
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; them get kicked around. They will come
&gt; &gt; &gt; out of this thing with their flag high. And when they do, they
are
&gt; &gt; &gt; entitled
&gt; &gt; &gt; to
&gt; &gt; &gt; thumb their nose at the lands that are gloating over their
present
&gt; &gt; &gt; troubles. I
&gt; &gt; &gt; hope Canada is not one of those.&quot;
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Stand proud, America! This is one of the best editorials that
has ever
&gt; &gt; &gt; been
&gt; &gt; &gt; written regarding the United States. It is nice that one man
realizes
&gt; &gt; &gt; it.
&gt; &gt; &gt; It is wished that the rest of the world would realize it. We are
always
&gt; &gt; &gt; blamed for everything, and never even get a thank you for the
things we
&gt; &gt; &gt; do.
&gt; &gt; &gt; We would hope that each of you would send this to as many people
as you
&gt; &gt; &gt; can
&gt; &gt; &gt; and emphasize that they should send it to as many of their
friends until
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; this letter is sent to every person on the web. We are just
single
&gt; &gt; &gt; Americans/U.S. citizens that have read this. We SURE HOPE THAT A
LOT
&gt; &gt; &gt; MORE
&gt; &gt; &gt; READ IT SOON.
