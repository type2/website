&lt;&lt;right on, any extras?, i need a good parts van or two!, well what i really
need is a fold down back seat and some bumbers for my 66.&gt;&gt;


Sorry dude, I'm in the same boat.  My back seat is a bench that folds down 
because the  that bolt to the side wall are missing and my bumper is gone as 
well.  Looks like we are competitors.  I do have access to some rare parts 
through an ex-VW mechanic family member so I'll keep you informed if he ever 
decides to open his treasure chest.  I get first dibs of course ;-)
