&gt;Anyway, you can take a bolt out, and go (in another vehicle) to a
&gt;hardware store and buy a new one with same threads, pitch, diameter.

And strength.  There are different strength ratings; the most common
today is probably 8.8 for metric bolts.  The rating system used to be
a number and a letter, so the Bentley will call for &quot;8G&quot; (now 8.8)
or &quot;10K&quot; (now 10.9) bolts.  The second table on
http://www.americanfastener_dot_com/technical/metric.asp has a conversion
chart.

Most things on a Bus will work fine with 8G/8.8 bolts, but a few things
require stronger ones.  For example, the front shock mounting bolts on
my '64 are 12K/12.9.  Quite often it's marked on the head of the bolt,
and it should also be in the parts manual.  If the parts manual lists
a &quot;Normteile&quot; part number (N 12 345 1), then it's probably OK to use
an 8.8 bolt.  If it has a VW part number (211 123 456), then check the
head of the bolt or the Bentley for a strength rating.

In this case, the spring plate bolts are listed in the parts manual as
M12 x 1.5 x 25, N 10 119 1, so using 8.8 bolts should probably be OK.
(They are 12 mm diameter thread, 1.5 mm between threads, 25 mm long.)
