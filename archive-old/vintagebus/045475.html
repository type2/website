&lt;&lt; hey all,
 the auto glass shop is a great idea... never thought of it. where exactly is 
 the water coming into the bus? between the glass to rubber area or the seal 
 to frame area? and for the people that have gone to the glass shops do they 
 seal both of these areas?
 thanks,
 Bob Margiotti &gt;&gt;
I had the front window in my 71 bus installed by a pro (after I cracked one 
myself)  They installed it without any sealant, then injected sealant between 
the rubber and frame, did nothing to the glass and rubber.  That was 5 years 
ago and so far, no leaks.  Being a &quot;never say die, at least not for long, 
type of guy,&quot; 2 years ago I installed a front window in my bug without any 
sealant and so far it hasn't leaked either.  Not very conclusive.  Sorry!
