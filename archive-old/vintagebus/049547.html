Subject: Re: [VB] BBB V 2001 in Arizona - Photos from Saturday going up now

HEY! You guys need to add NAMES to those busses - there were some beauts
(and some monstrosities... tho that lowered gray panel looks disturbing in
a kinda coool way), and i for one would like to know who the proud owners
were.
And did that 64 that 'had to sell at BBB' do so?

PS - don't know if its an Aridzona thing or what, but according to the
photos, Large MiddleAged  Dudes With Beards outnumbered women, children and
grains of sand out there :)
