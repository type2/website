&lt;&lt; I personally wish the mags well and am saying that
 they are only missing a good time. It's too bad that
 the subscibers are limited to the &quot;sano&quot; vehicle of
 the month. And thanks for getting the first issue of
 my Christmas present subscription to me by June. &gt;&gt;

My other gripe is that they only cover *pristine* vehicles and not those (or 
few of) that are actually used.  I would like to see more attention paid to 
busses that are drivers
