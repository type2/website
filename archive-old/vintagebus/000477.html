&lt;&lt; The SC is missing 3 of the M12 bolts securing the redux boxes to the

Hi Bill,
Definitely get longer bolts.  Then at the least tap the holes deeper, but we 
highly suggest drilling, and tapping them deeper.  Just make sure to use a 
HSS (High Speed Steel.) tap that is a low size.  Yes there are different fit 
taps!  H3 is the biggest size, and will end up giving you a too big of fit 
hole for your bolts to vibrate out of.  H2, and H1 are slightly smaller.  
Then there is standard, and then L1, L2, and L3 which are slightly smaller, 
and smaller.  
   We recently figured this all out trying to get a tap to clean out rusty 
lug bolt threads in brake drums without removing any steel.  We now have 
standard tap which does the job in a class B fit.  Class A has to be wrenched 
threaded together.  Class B fit can be threaded by hand.  Class C fit results 
in being able to just spin the threads together!
