&gt;&gt;Matt Roberds:
&gt;&gt;IMHO, there's way too much interesting stuff to play
&gt;&gt;with in the areas of mainstream science to waste 
&gt;&gt;time, energy, and money trying to make your Bus
&gt;&gt;get 100 MPG.
&gt;
&gt;But would you mind if I tried?

Like I said, IMHO.  It's nominally a free country, in
the US at least, and you can do what you want.

Again IMHO, bolting on a magic carb is not going to
make a Bus get 100+ MPG.  If you really want efficiency,
you probably need a fuel that already comes as a gas
(like propane), plus a closed-loop feedback fuel
delivery system.  New cars come with such a fuel
system, but they are tuned for least emissions, not
highest fuel efficiency.  As the technology gets
better, these two goals converge more and more, but
there is still, I think, a gap there.

The next step up would probably be some kind of
hybrid liquid-fuel and electric propulsion.  Use the
electric for acceleration and deceleration, which
can be efficiently done with modern motor drives,
and the gas or diesel engine for steady cruise, where
it can operate most efficiently.  The Toyota Prius
is one example - 52 mpg city, $21k list.

The basic design of the Bus powertrain and fuel system
is from 1935 or so.  Since then, technology has gotten
a little bit better.  :)

As far as the idea that workable high-mileage carburetor
ideas exist and have been suppressed...

The initial URL you gave showed a patent.  Anyone in
the world can get a copy of any patent from the Patent
and Trademark Office for some low fee ($1-$5 or so.)
These days, you can look them up on the Web for free.
It's hard to see how a patented idea could be
suppressed.

Just for fun, though, let's assume that a workable
carburetor that could reliably deliver 100 MPG on
pump gas existed in 1965, and cost the same to
manufacture as a comparable carburetor of the day.
So, when does this carburetor get installed in
regular production...?

...in the late 1960s, when Germany and then Japan
started kicking the US carmakers' butt?  If you
could buy a '70 Impala that got 100 MPG, that'd be
a great sales advantage.

...in the mid-1970s, with the OPEC oil embargoes?  If
Ford could have sold a Pinto that got 100 MPG, they'd
be running three shifts at the plant and still be
behind.

...in the late 1970s, as smog regulations got 
stricter?  Again, smog and fuel efficiency are
antagonistic in some areas, but I think it's safe
to say that you'll make less smog burning 1 gallon
of gas to go 100 miles than you will burning 5
gallons of gas to go 100 miles.

...in the 1980s, when Chrysler had to get bailed out
by the government?  Would they have needed those
loans if a K-Car got 100 MPG?

What I'm trying to say is that there has been
considerable financial incentive over the years
for various automakers to use this technology, if
it existed.  Very considerable financial incentive.

A counter-argument might be that the oil companies
have even greater financial incentive to prevent the
use of such a fuel-efficient carb.  I really don't
think, though, that they could buy off every single
person in the world with the knowledge to build
a high-mileage carb and fit it to their car.  Most
of the designs on that link you gave look to me
like things that could be made by any good machine
shop - usually there is at least one or two in
a town of 500,000 people or more.  That's a lot of
places that these carbs could be made and tested,
if they worked.

I would conclude that the 100 mpg carburetor
doesn't exist, or that if it does exist, it is
unworkable on a practical car.
