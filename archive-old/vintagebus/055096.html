Subject: Re: [VB] Pomona, new Bus.........

Maybe you should get ahold of Rich in Fresno, he has
one, and at one point he was asking for info on it
almost every day on the samba classifieds.

&gt; What I got is a '59 LH cargo door Panel with a Westy
&gt; SO-1 (sales flap) conversion. I found out about it
&gt; at the last Pomona and had to wait another 6 weeks
&gt; before picking it up. But well worth it!!! This is
&gt; going to be my new swap meet hauler / T-shirt sales
&gt; Bus. It fairly straight and rust free. I have
&gt; pictures of what the interior *should* look like,
&gt; but this one is gutted, so now I'm on a mission for
&gt; *any* info, pictures, pieces, etc. If any of the
&gt; listees can help please let me know. I'll have some
&gt; pictures up of it soon.
