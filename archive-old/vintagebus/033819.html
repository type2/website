&lt;&lt; Me too, but since I have a '67. That's a 67-only block-off plate. &gt;&gt;
Hi Jason,
Here is a news alert!  ;-)  1967 only bus radio block off plates are really 
1958-67 bug block off plates without the three holes for the chrome strip 
that the bug has!  Finding bug block off plates of these years that happen to 
be missing the chrome strip is pretty easy and since most bug owners want the 
chrome strip with it the block off plate by itself is rather inexpensive!  
One could probably cut holes in it to mount gauges in it also!  Eric&amp;Barb
