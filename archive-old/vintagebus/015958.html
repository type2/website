Subject: Upgraded headlight wiring
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

I once upon a time found a link for a modified
headlight circuit that involved a couple relays and
additional wiring from the alternator or battery
inserted into the mix to give more juice to the
headlights.  Am I remembering incorrectly or does
anyone know of what I speak?  If so, does anyone in
listland have a link to it if it's on the web anwhere?
I just installed a new wiring harness (from wiring
works - AWESOME!) and all contacts are clean and I
used contact cleaner, etc.  Also, the headlights are
functioning correctly, just dim.

Thanks,

Paul
