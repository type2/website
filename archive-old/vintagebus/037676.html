 &gt; hey Everett, where did you get the March 8 56 bumper change date from?  
 &gt;
 The data Hannover started producing Buses, correct?
 
 I'm sure there were some left-over bumpers, though, so the change probably 
didn't technically start then, like all things VW.

well, that is close to the date they switched the plant to Hannover, however 
I do not have any hard data on the exact date or VIN of the bumper change.  
Which is why I have been trying to make a list of buses made around the 
change, and esp if the owner believes it has the original bumper on it.  It 
has correlated with the Hannover/Wolfsberg switch,   which led me to believe 
that was when the change was.     I have also jumped to the conclusion that 
was the time of the 6 to 4 legged middle seat change.  But again, no real 
evidence when exactly that was.   These may have been changed a thousand 
buses apart.   I know some early (Wolfsberg) 56s with the original middle 
seat- six legs.  Just hoping  you had found something like a change date 
somewhere.  Isn't figuring this stuff out fun?
