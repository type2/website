Subject: Re: [VB] RE: [T2] Snake oil or real product

The use of magnets to immobilize ferrous wear particles is very real,
however the magnets that are sold for these purposes are typically rather
--------------------------- Clip --------------------------
First I have to admit that I am a klutz.
Every time I change my oil I burn my fingers and drop the drain plug in
the tub of hot oil.
When I installed my first Type IV Air Cooled engine I kept dropping the
plug, same goes for my most recent engine, I'm still a klutz.
I use a magnet on a extension handle similar to a radio antenna to get
the plug out of the hot oil.
I noticed that I was getting minute metal particles on the retrieving
magnet.
Just for a hoot I tore up a Winchester Hard drive and removed the
magnets, these are very strong magnets riveted to a steel plate and fit
the Type IV strainer plate surface to a T. They are so strong that they
adhere through extreme rainwater splashes and 65/75 mph speeds without
moving a fraction on the strainer plate.
From then on I never got any minute iron particles from my engine oil,
roughly 140K on the first engine I used them on. It could have gone
longer but I rebuilt it and started the magnet routine on the new engine.
Same scenario, it caught the iron particles in the strainer plate. To
judge the volume on a new engine I've got to say the particles leveled
the strainer plate top side for the first 8000 miles. It is substantially
lesser amounts as the engine has seated the cylinders and other steel
parts.
Its cheap insurance even if it just makes you feel better.
