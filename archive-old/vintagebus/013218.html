&gt; My guess would be that you are getting 2195.12 revolutions per
minute. 
That's kind of a rough number.  Are you sure it isn't 2195.13 RPM? :)

The
&gt; way I get this is that if you are going 60 mph then you are
traveling 1
&gt; mile or 5250 feet in a minute. Times this by 12 inches in a feet and
you
&gt; are going 63000 inches in a minute. Divde 63000 by the diameter of
your
&gt; wheel and you get 2195.12.

This is where you lost credit on the problem.  &quot;The wheels on the bus
go round and round&quot; so it's the circumference that counts.  You have
to divide by the value of the diameter multiplied by pi (3.14)

This gives a value of 703RPM for the wheel.  You have to multiply this
number by the reduction box ratio, the ring-and-pinion ratio, and the
gear ratio of the gear you are in (probably 4th!) to get the engine RPM.

Another possible source of error is the difference between static
circumference and rolling circumference.  You measure rolling
circumference by marking the sidewall of the tire and the ground, then
rolling the bus forward for one or more revolutions and measuring the
linear distance on the ground.

&gt; &gt;Anyone have a 14&quot; rim for sale for our '65 Westy? Two would even be
better,
&gt; &gt;our spare is bent, and i want to take an extra spare for our trip to
&gt; &gt;Newfoundland. We are going to run the 225-85R-14LT tires, 28.7&quot;
diameter.
&gt; &gt;Any of you math wiz's out there that can tell you our rpm at 60mph?
&gt; &gt;thanks, Jim
