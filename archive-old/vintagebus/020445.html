Subject: Who drives a Split Window Bus?
To: vintagebus &lt;vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com&gt;

Hi List   Mark here with is 67 Deluxe sick and in bed
in the driveway under a pine tree that has been cut
back just enough so the birds wont tag her.Her engine
is sick and I am on the trip to find out why....Looks
like she is worn out.Pulled all the spark plugs and
put a compression tester in the #1
hole....chug...chug...chug....Check it..&quot;0&quot; that dont
seem right...try # 2....chug..chug...&quot;0&quot; zero....put
all the other plugs back in....#1
test....chug...chug.....&quot;75&quot;lbs...#2 all other plugs
in...&quot;75&quot; lbs....same way
#3...&quot;110&quot;lbs....#4.....&quot;50&quot;lbs...Check the valves
again? She if the head bolts are loose? just drop her
and get a new one? While I am at it might as well get
a new complete harness and detail out the engine
compartment....I like the just leave the body alone
school of thought ...or dont over do it way because it
fits the pocket book of this dude.My old bus is
sitting just about the way I got it in 94....stock..it
is all there...worn and tired...I guess I like it that
way...no worries...but I want the engine and all the
electrical to be spot on.Brakes are done and I could
stop her now with a double load of sweating to the
oldies ladies on board headed down the Grand Canyon on
a black ice day.....well something like that.....Oh,I
was thinking who are we that drive those split
windows....some sound like they have kids...others
sound young...ladies...part shop owners....and me...a
poor old brown long hair with a mustache right out of
the 70's......fits the bus I guess....Kids flash me
the Peace V sign....when I am in that Bus.All buses
are not Hippy buses that I know ...That keeps it
good...We cant all be the same...dont want
that.Someone wrote about someone doing a different
approach on door panels...with a map I think it
was...I had a bad panel on the cargo side door that
gets most of the use.I took some old levis and had
good old Mom sew them together with the pockets(front
and back ones) close together then I wrapped that
around the original panel.I got a side door with
storage for little items in those pockets.Just wanted
to say Hi, and do my part in keeping the list alive
and kick'in.  Mark and his 67 Deluxe.....Old Levi?
aaahhh.......
