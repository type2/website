Hi all,

Just wanted to say I really enjoyed my first VW campout.  It was great 
meeting you and for those of you I didn't get to meet, I'll see you next time.

I wanted to share something that happened on my trip home.  I was cruising 
down
I-85 heading towards Atlanta, singing to some good tunes and thinking about 
the great weekend I had.  Somewhere a little voice said 'Pay attention, slow 
down, get in the right lane'.  No sooner than that 'thought' left I looked 
further down the road to see parts and pieces sailing through the air and a 
sea of brake lights.  I slowed down and pulled all the way over to the right, 
off the shoulder.  A sports car had managed to make its way under the belly 
of a semi and was completely crushed up front.  Someone stopped in front of 
me and pulled a young woman out.  Amazingly enough she walked away with only 
a cut on her hand.  

Moral of the story, listen to the little voices in your head!  
Happy and safe traveling.
Til next time,

Diana
