Ok. This was my fault, but not long after i got my bus I put some creases in
the drivers side back by the vent louvres and I'd like them gone, please :).
Question is, whats the best way to do it? I've heard the panels can be taken
out and stretched, so to speak, but thats impossible on a bus, as its all
one panel. I would prefer to not use bondo, something that will last. I know
nothing about bodywork, so excuse my ignorance. Also, anyone know if its
possible to get a Dormobile top, just the top? Maybe attached to a parts van
if the price was right.
Thanks for any help.
