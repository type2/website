depends on your level of perfection/time to work on it/money to pay someone 
else &amp;buy parts.

A friend of mine had bad tranny mounts- it messed up the shift rod holder 
under the front of the car, cracked the nose cone and bent the hockey stick.

his tranny had no 2nd and popped out of 4th, so it got a new tranny, and it 
also had the worst RGB bearings i'd seen- 7 out of 8 were bad, and new mounts

18 K later he has some shifting weirdness- of course the warranty on the 
tranny is gone.

you cane take a long bar under the bus and pry at the front and see if the 
mount comes apart.

whether you want to spend for a new tranny is up to you.  it's more work.   
you have a little whine? Have you tried changing your tranny oil and doing a 
tea leaf reading on it?  

if you get a new center section you can change the gearing- forget what year 
bus you have (little nut rear end or big nut),  it's a whole new world to 
explore!!!  Changing the tranny will take some time.   takes at least a 
weekend me by myself.  If you add redoing RGB bearings more.  and seems to 
add doing more stuff while bits are out (new fuel line/engine to body seal 
etc).  If your add in tearing down the motor to a long block and retorqueing 
the heads and cleaning and painting all the engine tin and changing the 
carberettors to a dual sort it'll be a week.

I recommend taking the Idiot book and reading the section on tranny 
replacement.  That is what I used when I first pulled a tranny (in the dirt 
when I lived in a cabin in the mountains- ten miles uphill from town.)  
Bentley describes the RGBearings.  To replace the front mount I pull the 
motor, then undo the RGBoxes from the spring plates, prey the trans back  to 
pull/replace the front mount.   some people tell me you dont need to undo the 
rgboxes, but really i did.

 Excellent...just what I wanted to hear :)  I have the Bently, just not in
 front of me (i'm at work) but i'll take a look at it.  So in order to
 replace it, I have to drop the engine and slide the trans out a little to do
 so, right? The trans is also whining quite a bit, and now in fourth, makes
 sort of a bubbling/gurgling sound.  Needs a rebuild? Back to my other
 question. What trans do I get? Will a new Rancho from Ronnie solve this? I
 know I can't just shove a new one in there and drive off...so what is
 involved on my end in terms of getting the old one out and the new one in?
 Thanks.

 &gt; Do you have one of the repair manuals?
 &gt; 
 &gt; The front mount is a rubber-centered, sorta rectangualr thing.  The
 &gt; transmission bolts to it, then it bolts to the body.  The rubber and
 &gt; adhesive deteriorate over time, and it comes unglued.   When it does,
 &gt; the weight of the engine on the transmission causes the front of the
 &gt; transmission to lift.  This puts strain on the coupler, and nose cone.
 &gt; If left too long, it will crack the nose cone, bend the shift rod,
 &gt; and possibly damage the shift selector.
 &gt; 
 &gt; To replace it, you will need to slide the transmission back about 3&quot;
 &gt; or so.  Ideally, you should replace the coupler, front mount, and the
 &gt; two rear mounts all at the same time.  You could also do the axle boots
 &gt; while you're at it.  Yes, it's a solid afternoon of greasy work, but
 &gt; you won't have to worry about this stuff for a while!
