OK, I've searched the archives and found that everyone says to use GL4 and
stay away from GL5.  Question is: Where are you finding GL4?  I've checked the
standard Autozone, Advance and NAPA.  No one carried it.  The NAPA guy didn't
have it in his books to order even.

Anyone use the synthetics?

Dave
