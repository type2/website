Subject: RE: [VB] stripped spark plug hole

I'm kind of with Dave on this one. When I don't have Jerry over at NW Con Rod
rebuilding my head and it's just a stripped spark plug hole, I use the quick
kits and the local FLAPS. They are one better than a Heli Coil and just below
Time-Serts which are the more expensive method. I have never had a problem
with a spark plug hole repaired in this way. The one thing I would recommend
is to remove the head to do this, but you can goop up the threads of the tap
with Vaseline jelly to collect the shavings if you must do it in the van. Just
be sure to run it in slowly and back it out carefully every five or six turns
to clean and replace the Vaseline.

Eric&amp;Barb must be rolling in dough !
I won't argue the superiority of the official Time-Sert.
The garden variety insert can be found at a local Flaps
and will install quite nicely and securely if
proper procedure is applied.
