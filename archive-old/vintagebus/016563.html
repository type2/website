Subject: re my bus runs better after it rains

the reason that happens is that the rain drops get onto the cooling fins and 
give your bus a boost because it runs  better but don't get any ideas of 
installing sprinkler heads in your engine compartment it doesn't make that 
big of a differance just maybe a little but
