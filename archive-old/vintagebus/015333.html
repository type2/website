I have a few parts that I don't know much about. I'm hoping a list member can
shed some light....1- I have what looks to be a base for a &quot;pull-out&quot; radio.
It's old and its German. It has a jumper setting that can be changed from
&quot;auto-battery-12v to 6v and &quot;Kofferradio-battery&quot;-9v it also has a sticker
that says &quot;Haltevorrichtung&quot; -some sort of warning?, some numbers, then Made
in Germany.??? 2- I have a bus fuel guage dated 1-62, it has a different face,
no &quot;VDO&quot;, it has an orange needle, F and E. Not R and 1/1. Is this an early
style?
Thanks,
Michael

P.S.- Still needing a washer bottle for my '65. Willing to pay up to $100.!!!
