My  wife and I were on our way to Michigan for our vacation and about
midway through Illinois I spotted a white over blue 70's bus
approaching  in the rearview mirror ( I heard it before i saw it). 
Eventually it caught up and passed, puffing black smoke, running on
three and a half cylinders and sounding as if a blacksmith was randomly
hammering on the engine. 

	As they went around, these two rogues were waving and grinning wildly
with the wind whistling through numerous nose, ear, eyebrow rings and
covered with tattoos. I was expecting the side door to slide open and
see grappling hooks swing out or see Quequeg launch a harpoon at us,
however they assumed the lead about eight feet in front of us puffing
black smoke until we hit our exit about another 5 miles ahead. We hoped
they made to their next port before their engine expolded.

	BTW, I'm running a 30/31 Pict carb (125 main jet) on my 1776 dual port;
stock valves, vacuum advance, compufire, full flow, 3.88/1.26 transaxle.

	The gas mileage stinks! 16mpg at 60-65mph on the freeway; any ideas?
I'm getting my 30 pict -1 rebushed, so this carb isn't a permanent
fixture. I kind of suspect the extractor/single muffler ( no heat riser
flow to manifold), which is causing condensation just below the carb and
probably on the inside as well. I also have a feeling this Everyman Carb
is suspect.
