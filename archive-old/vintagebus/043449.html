&gt;
&gt;Well, at a current price of roughly $600 per ounce for platinum, of
&gt;course they're going to be expensive.  Maybe you should consider going
&gt;with something a bit cheaper, like gold ($264/oz) or silver
&gt;($4.70/oz).  Or if you *do* decide for that 100-point resto, go for
&gt;rhodium ($1700).

You can get the platinum a little cheaper by scavenging it yourself from
late bay-window and Vanagon catalytic converters.  I know where you can
get some Iridium for free (if it hasn't all burnt up yet) but you have
to figure out how to haul it off and it's kind of hard to get to...the
folks at http://198.116.142.34 are probably one of the few people that
could help you tow some of it home.

You also have to be careful not to upset the weight balance of the
vehicle.  For a Bus, this is not as critical.  For a Bug it matters
more and for something like a Schwimmwagen it's absolutely crucial.
I heard of a guy that was trying to re-do his Schwimmwagen interior
in copper, but his vendor was out, so they shipped him the next metal 
over.  The panels went in OK, but then he found out he couldn't take
it out on the water anymore or it would zinc.

Personally, I think all those fancy metals are for trailer queens and
$30K Ebay Busses.  When I do the panels in my Bus I'm going with
something basic, like carbon or iron.  Cobalt might be a nice contrast
to the turquoise exterior...first, though, I have to get the engine
stannum in order.
