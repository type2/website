&gt;With all this negative talk.....I am definately reconsidering the trip.  I 
&gt;just can't see driving that far and not being able to get into the show.  
&gt;Camping with a wife and two kids....the word 'early' left my vocabulary 
&gt;years ago!

Well, personally...I went to KP for the first time last year and was kind
of underwhelmed. The swap was the best part of the show, and if that's
going to be smaller...well, maybe I'll buy a couple of beers for Thom and
we can sit this one out. I mean old buildings and grass are cool...but not
for that price to get in. I've already made a pact with myself that I won't
pay the $20 to take a vehicle into a show...so that's out. And then I'll be
paranoid about my stuff (or the whole car/bus/whatever I drive) getting
stolen. Hey...maybe we can have a &quot;Not Going to KP&quot; Vintage Bus meet at a
pizza joint nearby?

BUT, I would not miss BYOB for anything. OK, maybe I'm biased, but we
SV2er's KNOW how to put on a show. And the Silicon Valley Chapter does a
GREAT job. This year will be much bigger than last...bigger swap and bigger
show. And I think I can easily say that the BYOB raffle will BLOW AWAY
anything that KP does (unless you REALLY need jumper cables). I think this
is turning into an OCTO/Classic thing where the hardcore bus-only folks
will come for Saturday and skip Sunday. There's no competition between the
shows cause they happen on separate days...and they really do help each
other, but there's a different vibe to each one.

&gt;Now the question is--Corona de Tuscon or SV2's club campout??

C'mon Beto...shake yourself. You know in your heart the answer to that
question too. ;)
