&gt; &lt;&lt; Out of curiosity, do early model year 67 busses have 6v or 12v? &gt;&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; Hi,
&gt; Well here below is what we found in our type 2 parts book.
&gt; 
&gt; M 620   12 volt system
&gt; (M 620 - standard equipment from 1st Aug. 1966)
&gt; 
&gt; So the 1967 model year was 12 volt.  Unless there were some special order
&gt; buses just before which would have slowed them and made them come out just
&gt; after the model change, or afterward as special order for 6 volt.  Eric&amp;Barb

I know that Commercial buses were 12 volt as an option from 1964. Isnt
this an m-code?...
lemme look...
M620... available... doesnt say, But seems to me it was 64 mod year and
on....beacme standard aug 66.
