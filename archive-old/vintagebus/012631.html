pardon my cluelessness, im only 18, but...
hi, my name is mike, and i just joined this type II list, so here it goes...
i am currently restoring (probably not to original cond') a '66 bus and i need some advice on what to do about brakes...i have been getting mechanics to get me started on this project, cos i just started restoring, and i dont know where to start, but i need advice on how much i should expect to pay for a complete brake job (master cyl. and all), or if it is worth it just to do it myself. or if it is even possible for me to attempt this myself. i dont know much about what to do, so any advice would be much appreciated. thank you

mikie!
