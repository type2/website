&lt;&lt; O.K.!  The decision has been made, a new tranny is going in the bus.
 By the way, it's a 65 21-window microbus.  My question is this, with all
 the different rebuilders out there, which one do I choose to buy a
 rebuilt from.  I've seen ads from GEX to KCR, any advise on who to work
 with?  The prices look like $350 or so, sound about right?   &gt;&gt;

Hello,

If you want to go mail order from the Calf. companies then I would 
recommend either Rancho or Carter's.  Both have been around a long
time and both have good reputations.  

I sell the center section Type 1 style transaxles for $299.95 exchange.
By the time you get core and shipping charges involved I'd figure on 
another $75 or so depending on how you want it shipped and where
you want it shipped to.  

Your '65 orginally came with a 4.125 ring and pinion set.  I have been
building quite a few 3.875 ring and pinioned redux box transaxles lately
as it really improves the top end performance.  I sell those for $450.00
exchange.  Mine, like just about everyone else's, come with a 12 month
unlimited mileage warranty.  Oh yeah,  I hope your redux box bearings
are OK as the bearing costs are beginning to get outrageous- around
$340 for all eight bearings not to include the labor to install.

Finally, beware cheap rebuilds.  I *know* what goes into a quality job
and those ads which claim to have done it for less than $200 are full
of it!  As a general rule of thumb the more expensive it is the better it
is.  Always ask what goes into the rebuild so you can compare apples
to apples.  

Good luck and don't hesitate to post me direct if you have any questions
you think should be off-line.  While I do rebuild transaxles at my business
I don't think that this list is the place to discuss it.  But I'd be happy to
answer any general question you may have on transaxles here on the list!
