&lt;&lt; How much oil should I put in the reduction boxes? Thanks. &gt;&gt;
Hi Chris,
Till they are full, and then make sure to refill the center section.  About 
half of the center section oil can and will refill the reduction in case of 
leakage.  Which buys you more time to notice all is not well and you have one 
heck of an oilly mess of a wheel well.  So buy a gallon and go at it.
