&lt;&lt; I doubt it is the condenser, but a new one cannot hurt since it is tune up 
time. &gt;&gt;

I disagree, since I have had more trouble with new condensers than old ones.  
I personally never replace a condenser unless it is defective.  When I was 
working on cars all the time I did a tune-up on a Renault, and got a bad 
condenser.  We had to go out and check this woman's car out several times 
until we discovered an intermittently malfunctioning condenser.

(Still waiting to check out why my engine gave it up on the way back from 
BBBV.)
