Last time I wrote about this I got raked over the coals for stating that high
octane fuel does not have any more heat content than regular gasoline.  I
really didn't give it much thought at the time, but as a kid I was always told
that the high octane gasoline that was run in airplanes (Cessnas, etc) was
real hot running and the engines were built a lot looser for this reason so
that the heat that these engines were exposed to would make components expand
and tighten up to tolerance when running normally.

Now, I'm confused.

My original message was as follows:

Most vehicles run better in the rain because of the water content in the air. 
When water is heated (as in the fire in the cylinders) the water turns into
vapor and works much like a steam engine.  But wait - that in itself would not
make it run better.  Propogation of fuel burning is the process of slow
burning of fuel.  When fuel burns too fast, all the energy is used at the
beginning of the stroke of the piston and there is none left for the rest of
the stroke.  This is why cheap gasoline gives crappy gas milage and
performance - it ignites like a firecracker.  But when more octane is added,
the burning process is slowed down, thus using all of the stroke and getting
the maximum mechanical advantage out of the engine.  Well, water will roughly
accomplish the same thing.  It slows down the burning process.  There is one
disadvantage to using a lot of octane - the fire burns significantly hotter. 
There is more heat to get rid of.  There is one advantage to using water
vapor! It actually cools the burning of the gasses.  Of course, the
disadvantage to using water vapor is corrosion of engine components.

You may ask,  &quot;Why are formula cars on alcohol, which burns like a bomb - no
propogation?&quot;  The engines in formula racers and dragsters turn so fast that
there is an advantage to having fast burning fuel.  The piston goes down so
fast that there is a need for a fuel that will burn fast enough to &quot;keep up&quot;
with the piston.  You may notice that the motors are started up on regular
gasoline and then they put them on alcohol after they get the engine running. 
This keeps the engine from being hammered to death at startup.

I got a resopnse from a very irate person on this, but I would like to know if
he is right on this - &quot;High octane fuels do NOT have any more heat value than
regular fuels!&quot;

So, could someone explain, or at least list BTUs per unit of different fuels,
or just generally shed more light on the heat content question?

Also, I'm getting conflicts on whether alcohol has high octane rating or low
octane ratings, according to Mr. Taylor's statement above.  Re - read
CAREFULLY the above post from me to see what I'm talking about.

Thanks for any help!
