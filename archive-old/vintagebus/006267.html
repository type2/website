I want to put in a oil temp gauge.  I took a look at what I could on the
archives ( when the search is running :p ) and it seems the recommended
solution is to use the dip stick sender?  Opinions were not conclusive.  I
had a oil relief valve sender a long time ago in another VW, any pros/cons
on either one?

Thank you,
Everett
