&gt; Gimme a break!  All those responses about whether

&gt; 
&gt; Go down to your local cheapo hardware box store,
&gt; find a rattle can that's close, do small sections
&gt; at a time, and rattle-can it!

Yea, did that with the Ch*vy truck, tooka case &amp; 1/2..
didnt last for 2 years:( $25 bucks too! Didnt really
look all that good either, I dont think they make
rattle cans anymore with the fan spray pattern...

&gt; Those that have the fancy compressor and such,
&gt; kinda assume that everybody has such a setup.

Well... yes &amp; no... I rented a compressor, went to a
local flea market &amp; bought a HPHV paint gun ($10) &amp;
went to town on the B*g... Looks good I think. Ask
anyone that was at the Josh Rogers Campout. Then went
&amp; got my &quot;own&quot; compressor... handy things to have, you
got a Harbour Freight store near ya? The place I got
the paint was a discount center, the cans were kinda
dented, the reducer didnt even have a label on the
can:) Gallon of paint (eurithane(SP), reducer,
hardener, &amp; retarder ran $55. Not bad...... Didnt have
to do any bodywork.... Wet sanded w/400 cleaned her up
and painted.....
 
&gt; This is really a situation for KISS.
&gt; Keep It So Simple

Exactly.... just like a VW.... sometimes:)
