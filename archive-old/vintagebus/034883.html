Subject: fastener list, partial
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

I made up a list of SS fasteners I want to get to put my project back 
together.  I thought I would share it in case anyone needs a checklist 
themselves. My list is missing internal fasteners of components (engine, 
tranny, etc...) and finish and trim fasteners which I already bought in kits 
from Volks-dragon.  Otherwise, it is kindof complete, like the election.  It 
might come in helpful for someone.  Here it is:

&lt;A HREF=&quot;http://geocities_dot_com/solohobbit/fasteners/&quot;&gt;fastener list&lt;/A&gt;

There is a MS Excel spreadsheet of the list there too.
