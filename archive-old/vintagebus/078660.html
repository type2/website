Subject: RE: [VB] Trip report: Yosemite, etc.

It looks like it is where the oil pressure relief valve connects (used
to be?).  Would this cause my temp. readings to be low?

Jim,
Where is your oil temp pickup point?
TIA
P &amp; C


&gt; Just completed a 1,500 mi. trip in my 1964 Kombi  At 60 mph, the
engine is working noticeably harder than
&gt; 55.  The engine (oil) temperature remained fairly constant 180 +/-,
&gt; except through the Mojave Desert where it increased to 210.
