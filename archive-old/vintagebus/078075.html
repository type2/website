Subject: RE: [VB] Single Wheel Trailer Hitch

  I made all of mine. I do have a clamp on hitch, but it goes to another one
of my trailers. The problem with the bolt on is that it is to low and the
trailer sits to far down in the front

I am looking for hitches (2) for my Harris single wheel trailer.  Anyone who
has them or any information on a source will be greatly appreciated.


Enjoy your day!
