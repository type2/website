I have a friend with a '59 standard that needs the frontmost shift rod
piece - the one that has the cup for the shifter to fit into.  His bus has
probably 600,000 miles on it - literally, and the piece is actually worn
through so he can't get reverse.  He's already replaced the bushing, which
is how he discovered the worn part.

You can email him at rayb_at_benetechinc_dot_com or contact him through me.

Thanks!
