Well it's been a quiet week for me.  Tuesday evening in Lincoln, NE, one of
my favourite bands of all time played - Firehouse.  They were an 80's style
band that made it big in 1991 and 1992.

Anyway, at age 27, this was my first concert ever to attend in my life.  It
was great, loud, wild, and fun but it also cost me some sleep - getting home
at 1:30 and to be closer to 3:00a.m. - It took the rest of the week to
recover from that one (no booze involved however.)

Just got the word today that my tins are powdercoated.  This includes
EVERYTHING involved in cooling - thermstat bracket, actuator rod, air vanes,
linkages, throttle tube, fan shroud, fan, and all engine tins except the T3
cooling tins (which I didn't want to remove.  The total came to $67.99 not
including any cleaning and sandblasting that was required before hand.  I
think that's a pretty good price considering I'll never have to paint them
again.

I had a friend of mine from work pick them up so I'll be getting them later
tonight.

All fer now...
