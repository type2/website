I mentioned two problems:

one:

low oil pressure once it warmed up.  to be more specific it had previosly been
about 30psi at about 3K rpm- 40psi if I am going faster than I should, and 20
if it was putting about 2000 rpms.  This has beconme to (once warmed up)
about 20psi at about 3K rpms, and even dropping to a mere (scary) 10psi as
about 2K rpms- though if I baby it or go down hill (little load) the pressure
does come up some- even to 30 psi at 3 K for a bit, then back to 20psi.   Oil
light coming on at idle when warmed up (usually).   This low oil pressure
gives me the willies.

other:   low power- not wanting to get up to speed, not wanting top pull hills
in 4th or even sometimes having problems pulling in 3rd.   

Both occured Suddenly- which does not indicate it being a gradual wear
problem.   I did a bunch of stuff to my motor will it was out- including
things which caused these problems.  
Each has a separate cause.
  stuff I did included:

reset end play.
adjust valves
clean spark plugs,
replace type 3 doghouse style oil cooler with a type 1/2 one, so I could
install the little air deflector tin around the oil cooler (aka hooover bit)
replace the fan housing with a nicer one
install new grommets here there and everywhere
install missing tin (the smaller one) under one side of the rear part on the
cylinder tin
install the metal tube the preheat hooks to to pick up preheated air from
right next to the head
rejetted the carb as it was running too rich (air correction jet/main jet)
installed a thermostat set up
