Subject: Middle Seat

Hi Volks,

I broke the hose out and gave the '66 a well deserved bath today.  Heck
it has been twenty-two years since the last one ;0 )  I was cleaning out
the interior looking for the hardware to attach the middle seat to the
floor.  I wasn't sure what I was looking for because my only experience
with a splittie is with a panel.  How does the seat attach to the floor
and with what?  Thanks.
