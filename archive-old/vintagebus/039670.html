ok, so im cheap... before i shell out a hundred clams for the rear hatch 
seal, anyone ever use any other weatherstripping to seal it up? the top edge 
of the seal appears to be melted (probably a torched motor) and when it 
rains, water runs in. i thought i saw a cheap alternative at The Bus Deopt 
once, anyone?
thanks in advance,
