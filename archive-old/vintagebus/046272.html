The most common response was one of appreciation for other's experiences

Not true.  I use the shit out of my bus (have good references!) and have
had no fewer adventures than anyone else.  However- I guess that I'm just
not impressed with anyone's tales of their annual roadtrip, I just assume
that if you are into buses, that's what you do, and unless you are a
truly inspired (and inspiring) writer, writing about it seems to be a lot
like masturbation.  But then I suppose a lot of writing, and art, is. In
truth I don't have much faith in (or trust for) human nature.   Anyway-
it seems that these tales are better placed on websites, than on a public
list, as some like George Lyle do.  I do appreciate them when I come
across them in occasional newspaper or magazine article, where they are
generally well crafted.  But being force-fed them daily gets a little
tedious, it would be better if they would remain in more marginal
sources.

Why do I write trip reports?    Is it merely masturbation ? (which everyone
does, and few like to admit to).    If you think so.    I personally am proud
to be able to haul long distances in an old VW, both that it gets me there, I
don't have a late model car alternative in any cae, and also glad I can find
the time to do trips.   If people get vicarious pleasures out of my ramblings,
amusement at my antics, or useful information, more power to them.    Also it
has the usefulness of people kindly offering hep if I get stuck on my next leg
(Thank you to those who did so), and sometimes invitations to meet folks on
the way (which I unfortunately this time did not take anyone up on, but thank
you too, it would be nice to slowwly put down the coast taking a couple weeks
and visiting and sightseeing).   I also write them to help mull over in my
mind what I did on the trip and think about how the bus did, and what needs to
be donr to it. 

   I tend to write &quot;what I did today &quot; stuff, as I have had more experience
than some in getting old buses going, and have had feedback that people like
to hear it, as it gives info about what to do and how to do it.

I get the impressions that some people don't have the time to take long trips.
Or they don't have a splitty.   Or the splitty is a project.  Or a running bus
that needs work where they don't feel confident in it to take it on a long
trip (or commut in it).   This makes sense, I am a freaking nut for driving
that truck 850 miles, right after getting it, when there are all sorts of
things that shoud be gone through, the thing I had most confidence in being
the motor.

Let me reiterate- no one is force fed anything on the list.   Virtually all
trip reports are labeled as such, and if you are not interested it is easy to
delete them.   Feel free to do so.    I was on this list when it was the
Vanagon list, full of water cooled stuff I don't know about and am not
terribly interested in.   I ignored that stuff, but would still read trip
reports and stuff about people's day to day Life with Volkswagens,
entertaining even if not about splitties.    Most of the time people use
headings that are informative, which rocks.   I don't read all the stuff on
the list, even after the last split, which lessened the traffic and purified
it into the splitty list, which is what I like.
 . . . . . . . . . .
SO- I posed the question originally to see what other's felt about it and
i think it created an interesting discussion.  There were some very
interesting comments, both public and private,....
As for the guy that suggested I buy a Ford.  Kiss my SWUN sticker...

Hey, I'm still waiting for my SWU:N sticker.
