Subject: WTD:  Creative Hole Plugging Ideas

I'm looking for some good ideas that are quick, simple, cosmetically
appealing, and undamanging to the engine tin.  I have the hot air intake,
heater duct, and heat riser holes that I need to plug in my rear tin.  I'm
going to attempt to take my newly built 1776 out to Colorado at the end of
this week in my 67 bus and I'm going to need to be able to plug these holes
in a way that won't damage my powdercoated tin.  I was thinking along the
lines of some kind of sandwiching clamp of some sort.  Anyone have any good
ideas for me?  Thanks for the help!
