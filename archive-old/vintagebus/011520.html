Part 3: Shipping Fun 
(Transporting the Beast)

VanBondo recently purchased a 1954 VW bus. Here is Part 3 of the adventure.
The last segment found me dangling from the end of the rope after
successfully bungee jumping into an international car deal. It was now time
to figure out how to get this punk into my sweaty hands. This segment does
contain boring details of getting the thing home. If you don't care about
how it was done then hit the Delete key now. You won't miss much.

You Want to Ship WHAT from WHERE?:
It has been my observations that the mythical VW gurus have never had a
hassle in their lives. They view International shipping as a walk in the
park. It seems that there is always an insider buddy that makes it all
happen and pays them for the experience. They always appear nonchalant about
everything. Of course this cant always be true. Right? My mental state while
coordinating the logistics of these adventures is one of a bad Gilbert
Gottfried after way too many expressos. I tend to feel like Jack Londen in
the last few paragraphs of &quot;Call of the Wild.&quot; Hint: always carry a Zippo. I
hope to appear and conduct myself more professionally on the outside.

The seller graciously agreed to reasonably assist in arranging delivery of
the vehicle to which ever Shipping line that I chose. He made
recommendations and communicated appropriately. A solution was eventually
secured and the bus was shipped. Transportation took approximately a month
and arrived in Southern California. Communication via email was the
preferred method but occasional voice contact was required a few times.
Coordinating the appropriate time of day in which to speak with persons in
Denmark was a trick. 
I started by conducting an extensive web search and contacted a few of the
mythical VW gurus for insights. Two methods of shipping are common: via
vehicle in a container or by way of a roll-on-roll-off (RO/RO) carrier. A
two sites that seemed helpful were The Electronic Shipping Guide at
http://www.shipguide_dot_com/ and Wallenius On-Line at http://www.wlna_dot_com. The
shipping guide tended to deal more with bulk freight and not automobiles.
Wallenius has a search engine-schedule at http://www.wlna_dot_com/wo/sc.w/z.
Ultimately, many of the shipping lines and shipping agents who advertise
international shipping must be referring to Sunday picnics in Vancouver or
Saturday nights in Juarez. Others concentrated on bulk shipping of the
containerized hockey pucks but not automobiles. Nearly very automotive
shipping agent's root source for shipping out of the North European Atlantic
was tracked down to Wallenius Lines. The other catch was that no one seemed
to ship out of  Denmark. UK, Germany, Sweden was no problem. Copenhagen? No
way. It appeared that the bus would have to be delivered to either
Gothenburg Sweden or Bremerhaven Germany. Eventually an interim port was
located on Denmark's Jutland. Wallenius does not tend to be aware of or
encourage these layover ports for some reason. I feel that only by being
persistent did the seller and I locate the final departure port. Credit
really goes to the shipping agent in Denmark who assisted Klaus.
Communications were not forthright from the Danish agent or the Wallenius
contact in California. I had to pester the hell out of them to find out what
should be expected and what documents would be required upon the ship's
arrival. It is my opinion that either of these folks should routinely send
out a confirmation packet which contains the expected procedures and
required documents. A human factors mentor of mine would call this the
requirement definition phase and proper feedback.

Typical Routine is easily defined as:
*Ship the Vehicle
*Have the Original Title and other available documents sent to you prior to
the ship's arrival at the destination port.
*A notification of the ship's arrival containing appropriate information
will arrive at your mailing address.
*Make a formal appointment time for meeting with the U.S. Customs Agent at
the port of arrival. This information will be contained in the arrival
notice from the shipper.
*Arrive at the office of the U.S. Customs Agent at the appointment time. 
*Present: The original title, the arrival notice from the shipping line, the
bill of lading or data freight receipt, bill of sale from the seller stating
the sales price of the vehicle *think about this ahead of time* and a form
of photo identification.
*Customs duty fees ~ based on the reported sales price ~, a port handling
fee and possibly an inspection fee if the vehicle was shipped in a container. 
*Pay the man.
*Proceed to the Shipper's office and pay them. They will direct you to the
office at the dock.
*Pick up the vehicle and go home.

My wife and I took a much deserved vacation during the last portion of the
ship's voyage toward California. We swung through the Oxnard, California on
our way home to Phoenix. We did a recon mission to find the Customs Office
and the Wallenius office prior to the arrival day. Our schedule placed us
back in Phoenix on Sunday July 26, 1998. The ship arrived in Port Hueneme,
California on Monday the 27th. I rode back to the port with the ground
transport person on Monday night. Arrived at the Port in time for the
Customs office to open and went through the steps. The procedures for
picking up the bus went unexpectedly smooth. Reaction from folks on the LA
area freeways was pretty cool.
