I'm looking for a rack that has the vintage appearance.  I posted last
week if this sounds familiar.  I don't want the westy size or the full
length.  I'd like the wood slat, aluminum bar around the top look, (i.e.
original style) but can't seem to find one anywhere.  I saw one in a
in-the-last-year-or-so recent VW Trends, the one titled &quot;50 Years of the
Bus&quot; with a Yellow and White splitty coming at you.  In there, in the
article that  describes the different styles of splits, (by the way, look
at the picture of the &quot;15 Window&quot;....  it's not.) the rack I want is on
the Kombi I think.  (Haven't looked at the mag in a while).

Please, any thoughts, suggestions, etc.  I'm driving to Missoula MT from
Aberdeen WA and need a good sized rack for the various goods I'll be
returning with.  I'd like to go in 2 weeks, but that depends on my rack
shopping...
