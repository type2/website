Hey,

I am about to embark on having an engine built for my panel.  I'd like to
query you all on what size(s) everyone has had good luck with.

First some background.:

1963' Panel, lowered with a beetle tranny, and drop spindles.(Please no
grips on this one)
I currently have a 1600 SP
I have just started the wheels turning to have a 1776cc built from scratch.
Carburation will be a Progressive.

This engine will have a balanced crank, and mild cam., Alternator(from a
previous engine), and .044 heads.

The builder pointed me twards a 1641, and to keep my stock carburation, but
I am building a motor, because I want some power.  The price for the 1641,
Would be only a hair less to build, and I figure if I am going through this
trouble, why stop with a smaller motor.

This engine will definitly be a driver, that I want to get many miles from.
I had an 1835, in my last bus, but that engine was a headache.  Overheated,
due to too high of compression, and thin cylinders. Then a cracked case, to
keep me diligent with the oil.

Anyone who has had good luck with a similar setup?  Bad luck?  I think the
1776cc will be a good descision, if it is built correctly, and I have
confidence in the builders.

I'd appreciate any feedback.

Thanks
