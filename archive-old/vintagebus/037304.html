&gt; Hi folks,
&gt; I could do with some opinions on carrying fuel.
&gt; 
&gt; i'm off on some trips, and as i don't have either my tap working right or
a
&gt; fuel gauge yet.. i'm thinking of taking a gallon can along with me.
&gt; 

I would carry extra fuel outside on the roof if you have a roof rack. Or if
you are just carrying fuel in case you run out, and I am not talking desert,
or long haul, here is what I have done just to get to the next station.
Now I know you all will yell at me but....
Of course I am carrying a stove, my bus is set up as a camper with a coleman
type stove, actually a back up to the propane stove conversion I usually
use, built into the coleman. I also carry a lantern that needs coleman fuel.
So I carry a small bottle of coleman fuel contained in a backpackers bottle
for fuel. Holds about a quart. If I run out of gas, I put the coleman fuel
in the tank! 
Crazy, nuts, bad idea! But wait!
I put in the coleman fuel, add the emergency marvels mystery oil, and some
high octane boost. I am making my own fuel cocktail. The bus will go another
15 miles or so on this concoction, for emergency use only of course, but I
have done it once or twice. OK twice. Yell or scream, it has worked, and I
feel it cant do much harm.
