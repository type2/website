Well, I decided to just go ahead and buy new pistons &amp; cylinders, and a new head
to replace the cracked one. The uncracked one is getting redone at the machine
shop.  So my little motor will be a 1600 now instead of a 1500.  But I'm just
going to keep it single port.  As I understand it, the heads are still the same.
 

The endplay seems good, the crank pulley just barely moves at all.  The studs
all stayed in, I'm hoping they'll hold when I put the heads back on.  

Rod bearings... damn.  One more thing I guess.  I still have to figure out what
to do with my manifold: the heat riser is totally plugged.  no way I can get
a coat hanger through there.  I got a new oil pump and oil cooler, good thing
'cause mine was broken at the base.  Also am putting in a temperature gauge
so I don't overheat it again... I think I drove up too many mountain highways
in August.  It lost a lot of power then.

I might be going overboard, buying all this new stuff but I just keep thinging
of the miles I want to put on it, I figure 10 000 or so just this spring, so
I know any half-assed repairs are going to come back to haunt me.  At least
the VWFLAPS didn't charge me as much as what it showed in the catalog, but I
still spent a lot.  And I need a muffler still, 'cause the one I bought last
spring broke right away. (out of stock)


I have no clue how many miles are on it now, it was sold to me as &quot;fairly recently
rebuilt&quot; whatever that means.

By the time I'm done here practically all I'll have left from the original motor
will be the case, crank, alternator and tin.  Seems crazy.  

I'm still trying to visualize putting it all back together without screwing
it up... although now that it's apart I'm much less scared than I was before.


Thanks for all the advice.  Sorry for rambling but I'm totally fixated on this
motor right now.

&gt;you should also pull of the rods  (mark them too- I use a hammer and punch-

&gt;knock 1 dot for #1, two dots for #2, etc.  ) and look at the rod bearings.
 
&gt;rod bearings are only about $10 a set (us) you should replace them at this

&gt;time, the size is marked on the old bearings (they are like half rings) - you

&gt;must get the right size.

&gt;also- how is your endplay- with the FW still on and bolt tight, push pull the

&gt;crank pully- it should only move a hair.   if it thunks you may want to 
&gt;rebuild the bottom end, but then you may be able to get away with resetting

&gt;the endplay.   You should replace the main seal at this time too.  do you 

&gt;know how many miles the motor has?   How dirty/stained are the heads from the

&gt;side the rockers go on?   Did any studs pull out when you took the head nuts

&gt;off?
