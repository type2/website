Subject: Re: [VB] Church key location

Hi Claude,
The key stayed in the door pocket in pre-1961 buses.  Before this  change 
over the church key was shaped kind of like a &quot;T&quot; with handle loop  centered.  
The later church key was shaped like a &quot;P&quot;, so it would fit into  the post 1960 
church key holder.
