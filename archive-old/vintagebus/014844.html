Subject: My apology to the folks in NC
Date: Wed, 19 Jan 2000 08:47:25 PST
Mime-Version: 1.0

I would like to apologize to the folks in NC (except for those few who did 
me wrong). I was upset at the fact that twice I got a run around form 
someone in your fine state. I did NOT mean to accuse the entire state, nor 
did I mean to offend anyone in other states.

I just simply got upset and then when I was accused of being a nasty name, I 
had to bring out my guns to stand up for myself. Again, had I been able to 
correct this situation person to person, I would love to have done that. My 
hand was forced and I took the bet. Now I might have to take legal action 
for those who have accused me of being a liar and ruining my name on this 
list.

I, like you, only want to have nice VWs that I can enjoy and share with 
others. I only hope that others wont deal with said people and they will 
regret the day they ever did someone wrong.

Please accept my apology and if I am to be tossed off the list, then so be 
it.

Thank you and keep on Vdubbing....but dont lie to other VW folks !

David
