Subject: re:[VB] What's in your garage?
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

Garages are for working on cars, right?  Not for
storing them out of the weather.  Well, that's what my
wife told me when she said we needed a garage--it's
cheaper to have a good garage so you can work on the
vehicles any time of the day or year than it is to
have new reliable cars.  How can I argue with that
kind of logic.
So- my garage has my 65 double cab, all  my auto
related tools, cases of oil, shelves and cabinets and
drawers of hardware and VW parts and stuff for my Ford
9N tractor, 30+ VW shop manuals, 100s of other shop,
auto, or mechanics related books, one of my hand
cranked self-feeding post drill is mounted on the wall
for drilling big wholes in thick metal.  The 2 tons+
of batteries for out wind and solar powered electrical
system are in their own  sealed box along one wall.  A
8 foot countertop with kitchen cabinet drawers under
it and a couple of workbenches provide places to pile
more stuff.  Lots of pegboard and shelves.  It has an
attic, too, more books, stereo components, enlargers
for my darkroom if I ever get one built, stuff I
hardly recognize when I see it hides up there.
The other bus either sits outside (when the weather is
nice) next to the GTI rabbit and the Jetta that we
drive year-round, or it goes to the 40x100 foot pole
shed to get it out of the weather.  In the pole shed
is my youngest son's Rabbit pickup,  our spare Rabbit
GTI, 2 parts rabbits, some farm machinery,spare frame
and engine and parts for his 67 Honda 160 cycle, and
many pallets of VW parts, old windgenerators and
parts, 10 water heating solar panels that need to go
on the garage roof someday,  furniture that I will
work on someday, and parts for the 72 bus and the
other 75 bus that should get moved into the poleshed
when I make some room.  Also a 58 bug, spare bus front
end, bus doors, beetle bumpers, hood and engine
covers, old Delco and Kohler light plants (antique
engine power generators), and a windmill tower that I
ought to erect to put another wind generator on.
Then, in the barn, is my son's 160 Honda (much older
than he is), his shop with welder, lathe, and other
tools, my woodworking shop with all the regular power
tools and 1000s of hand tools (my other obsession is
hand powered tools for boring holes with), a couple of
Gravely garden tractors awaiting restoration, and the
lawn mowers and rototiller and garden cart and garden
tools.  Beer fridge is in the milkhouse attached to
the barn-  no room in the &quot;real&quot; garage.
Whew--lots more stuff out there, too--one of the
reasons we bought this place some years ago was the
pole shed and barn which gave us lots of instant
storage space for all the truck loads of stuff we
move.
