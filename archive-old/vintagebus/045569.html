 I'm trying to take the driver's inner door handle off of my '64.  I
 have driven out the little tapered pin but the handle won't budge
 off the shaft.  That's the only thing holding the handle on to
 the shaft, right?  Does the handle get stuck on the shaft a lot?
 I think the shaft is splined, so I can't just try to twist the
 handle to break it free.  I have tried prying the handle away
 from the door but no luck so far.
  &gt;&gt;

I replaced the drivers door on my 61.  then I wanted to remove the door panel 
and install a vapor barrier.   The 'new door' was relieved of it handle pin, 
but refused to part with the handle.  yes it is splined at at that point it 
should slide off, or really pop off as there is (or should be) a spring unde 
rthere.  But it was a stubborn piece and perhaps corrosion was a factor in 
fastening the piece together.  The door had come off a 23 window that had sat 
in rainy WA with the sunroof open for a couple decades, effectively killing 
since the entiure cargo and subfloors where steppable through, and the frame 
rail were no great shakes either.    I squirted a bunch of penetrating oil at 
it, and got distracted for quite a while until I decided the bus needed a 
tranny and motor etc and being a driver again.  So at one point I reached 
into the cab for something, and bumped the inner handle and it all sprung 
apart.   SO I dont know what to say except penetrating oil.  prying with a 
claw tooth hammer has worked before, but it can also cause damage.

When I reinstalled the handle I greased the spline before putting the handle 
on. grease is good.  Your bus loves grease.  grease grease grease.
