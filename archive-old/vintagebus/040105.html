Howdy,
  I have just about got my 72 westy interior in the 67.  It's far from 
perfect but it will work for now.  I have a major question: How should I 
bolt down the seat/bed in the area over the engine compartment?  It seems 
regular sheet metal screws might rip out it someone was seat belted in to 
the rear seat or there was a lot of junk in the back and the bus stopped 
suddenly.  Would a few good sized bolts do it or will I need to have 
something welded in sort of like where the seat belt bolts go?

thanks,
Wayne
