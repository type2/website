Subject: motor and seat Q &amp; update

A few Q's for you all.

1.  Who has the best price on new 1600 engine cases?  I am 0 for 2 on
finding a used case that is not cracked.  Can anyone help or have one
FS?

2.  Has anyone seen or installed TMI's new vintage bus seat covers?  How
do they fit?  Did they get the color scheem right?  (I want to use the
grey salt &amp; pepper)
I will be re-doing all teh seats (1/3-2/3 front, full middle and rear)

3.  The OCTO/Classic really fired me up on wnating to work on the 65
(Samba).  The bus has been sitting for the last 4 months while i recover
from shoulder surgery.  Someday i will get back out there and maybe even
finish it.

Thanks
