Morning all.
THe engine saga continues. Tried test fitting crank and cam in case.
For some reason, #3 bearing just didn't want to seat.  I looked closely
and discovered that the distributor drive gear was massively hosed.
With tears in my eyes off I went to the local guru.  We pressed the old
one off, on went a new used gear and hi ho hi ho it's back to work we
go.  Damn bearing still didn't want to seat.  Finally my friend Derek
came by and showed me that with new case and bearings you sometimes have
to persuade things to go into place.  We test torqued the crank into
place and rolled the pieces around.  SMOOTH!

So yesterday, I took the time to finish bottom end assembly.  lubed the
heck outta can, followers, everything that goes inside.  started the
assembly process then remembered that pesky cam plug.  Looked high and
low for the one that came with the case.  Nowhere to be found.  Off to
the Glinda the good parts witch.  She had one.  The nifty rubberized one
with the ridge around the outside. globbered formagasket around it and
proceeded to attempt to install it for the next 2 hours.  Every time I
started cranking the case together it'd pop out.  Seems older cases had
a ridge machined in them to hold the plug in place.  The new case does
not.  After fuming and saying many unpleasant things I took a break,
p-mailed the gurus in my address book.  A knock on the door and in
walked my friend Tom who took a look at it and said &quot;Why doncha cut the
ridge off'n th'plug?&quot;  Sure as anything, it went together without a
hitch.  The case is torqued together, cylinder studs installed, a good
place to stop for the day.

Today it deck height measure day.
