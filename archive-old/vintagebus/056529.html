Subject: Re: [VB] Re: 15&quot; Wheels

Does anyone need/want a set of 5 15'' bus wheels? 4 have nice matching radials
on them and the 5th is a spare tire. I can bring them to BYOB.......  What is
a fair price for them?


&gt; I think they don't mention 67 &amp; earlier buses as they are vanagon oriented,
&gt; and may not realise that splitties exist.
&gt;   I am sure you could bolt those wide 15&quot; rims on your splitty- dunno about
&gt; clearance though.  Might have  to cut the rear wheel wells.   The offset
&gt; looks dif than for the stock rims.      I tried putting Porsche 356 rims on
&gt; the back of my 61 and the offset is not like the VW rim and it didn't clear
&gt; the wheel well.   Oh- ya those are not stock bus 15&quot; rims- the stock bus 15&quot;
&gt; rims are 4.5 &quot; wide and have 4 sort of rectangular slots. ( the size is
&gt; stamped on the rim under the hubcap area)  kind of 'stock custom style' i
&gt; guess.
