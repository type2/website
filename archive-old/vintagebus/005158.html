Subject: Color, and how much?

So I'm thinking that it would be good to spend my birthday (today) going to
town and ordering the paint for our bus(+1) and getting a sandblaster.  (The
$100 sandblaster would be good to have...I'd use it on tougher areas as
paint removal, and the bumpers I'd also use it on would cost $25 each to
dip.....).  Please let me know if I should definitely not use it for
paint/rust removal on panels...?

How much paint should I get?  I have no problem getting extra of the L87
Pearl White, as I'll need enough for two buses anyway, but I don't know how
to figure the amount of Sea Blue that I'll need for the under-the-beltline
exterior only on our '66.  I'm using Nason single-stage catalyzed urethane,
by the way.

Thanks,

Gene
