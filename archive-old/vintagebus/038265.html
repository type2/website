&gt; where the heck does the resevoir go? 
---

Jack,

From My experience with the Wolfgang adapter Kit,

the old '67 Dual master cylinder reservior will fit just fine.

I was als told that a Rabbit reservoir will fit as well.

Wolfgang even includes the new seals between the reservoir and the Cylinder.

Other people have reccomended placing a the reervoir remotely like in the
loaf busses.  This may require the punching of new holes.

If you have specific questions,  P-mail me as I have the kit installed in my
'67.

GOOD LUCK!
