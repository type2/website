Subject: Boxers or briefs?

If you said boxers....

I got a 2 pack of boxers at W*l-M*rt last weekend. One pair was covered in
small vw bugs and the other was covered in small vw busses. Go get 'em...
if you can find 'em. I got the last package (that'd fit me) at the store
out here. My 3 year old son threw a fit in the store 'cause they didn't
make any his size. They're all for adults. He just couldn't understand why
he couldn't get any!
