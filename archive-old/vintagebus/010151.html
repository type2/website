well i didnt say that someone else did, but definately ordering parts is way
easier through email, or should be ....
ive dealt with about 10 people in the last month about parts that seemed a
little email challenged, if one wants to do good business one should reply
promptly and completely and attach the original message with the reply,
these are simple things that are not happening,
like i will send my list to a guy and he will quote me a price and then
dissapear for 5 days, meanwhile another guy has the part, but ive already
commited , etc, its crazy,

its much easier for me to type a list and email at 6 in the am then to call
during biz hours and spend an hour on the phone reading off part numbers,



so anyway , the guy from bus boys called me today , walter, sounds like a
cool guy and he was on top of it, he is sending replacement mirrors right
out, he said they are roscos, i guess it was a bad batch ,  i didnt want to
be negative towards them but
that would have been easier with an email ,

and while im on the subject ive sent 3 emails to the vw key guy gabriel ,
with no reponse for 10 days, does anyone know what happened to him,

does anyone else sell blanks for a 66 bus?

&gt; &lt;&lt;(just like it's easier
&gt; to bitch over the phone than it is in person)&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt; You really think so??!! I ALWAYS prefer to bitch in person. I wanna see
&gt; the person and look 'em square in the eye. That is the main reason I try
&gt; always to order within what I call &quot;choking distance&quot;. Not that I am
&gt; really gonna choke anyone or that I think I am a bad dooood or anything.
&gt; . . it's just that I like doing things face to face.
