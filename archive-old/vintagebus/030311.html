&gt; I just bought a middle seat, can anyone point me to a picture or explain
 what the handles should look like?  It's a 23 window version.
&gt;
Metal grab handles with aluminum ends, the first pic that comes to mind
is:

Possibly hard to find, I sold a set with 1 busted end in June for $150 so
you know what you are looking at for pricing.
