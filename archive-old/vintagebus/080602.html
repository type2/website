Subject: Re: [VB] head removal

Keep goin'! just make sure you take both of the bottoms off first- it makes 
things a bit easier. As for the top driverside I've found it easiest myself 
to go at it from below the middle of the bus with my arm hooked over the 
heaterbox (a bit uncomfortable but its the only way I've found to get enough 
torque on the wrench) best of luck

i got the bottom left one off, now i just need to get the other three 
off.... all before friday night!!!
