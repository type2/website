Subject: E-bay tricks?
Message-ID: &lt;36F18B90.EFD6FEB_at_earthlink_dot_net&gt;

Well , since it is still Friday and I'm noticing quite a few people on
the list are using E-bay, I have some questions for you e-experts.

While bidding on a bus part recently I was out bid at the last second by
someone else.  When I say last second, I mean LAST second!  I was the
high bidder till about 3 seconds left on the auction.  I was refreshing
the screen every 5 -10 seconds and thought I had it in the bag and with
3 seconds left someone else bid 1 buck higher.  Oh well I
thought..nothing I had to have.  It did get me thinking though.

The person who won, had not bid on the auction at all until that final
bid.  Two questions:

1. How did they know what my bid was?  My maximum bid was 5 dollars
higher than the current high bid.  The winning bid was only one dollar
higher than my maximum bid.  Aren't all bids sealed till the close of an
auction?

2. Was it just luck that they submitted a bid and hit it with only a few
seconds left on the auction?  It seems to me that either someone was
VERY lucky or they have a way of setting up a routine that automatically
bids one increment higher at the last second of an auction.  Is this
possible?

Curiously, I wrote to customer service and asked.  This is what they
said:

&quot;What may have occurred, is while your screen was updating, the other
user placed a bid in the last seconds of the auction. This is what is
referred to as &quot;sniping&quot;, a practice that, although perfectly within the

rules of eBay, is discouraged as a bidding strategy.

&quot;Sniping&quot; is the practice of waiting until the last few minutes or
seconds of an eBay auction and outbidding the current winner. Most
bidders, who are used to more traditional auctions where the gavel only
falls when there are no more bids, feel very annoyed and frustrated by
it.

There is no real tips or tricks to avoid being sniped --just good old
fashion common sense of bidding the maximum you feel comfortable with.
We continuously encourage bidders to make proper use of the proxy
bidding system that is in place, and to bid the absolute maximum they
are willing to pay for an item right from the start. This way, even if a

bidder is outbid, they will not pay more than they are willing to, or
can afford.

The time it takes to redraw your screen or to bid on an item can vary so

much, depending on the computer you use, the modem and the internet
traffic and the time you bid. (If you bid during a prime time, it can
move pretty slow sometimes.)&quot;

Is this correct???  Thanks for any insight!

Steve
