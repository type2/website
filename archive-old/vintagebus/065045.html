Boat people call this device an &quot;anchor&quot;  Works great if you have one
handy!  If not, another approach is to dig a hole a couple of feet deep
big enough to hold the spare tire.  Dig a narrow trench pointing toward
the vehicle for the cable.  Attach the cable to the spare, drop the spare
in the hole, and fill the hole with dirt.  This will provide enough
purchase to get the vehicle out.


  good idea if you spend a lot of time in
&gt; isolated areas cuz even if you can make cell signal
&gt; calls to 911 sometimes they aren't clever enough to
&gt; find you.

Cell phone sites can only locate you to an area of a square mile or so, if
you're lucky.  New models incorporating GPS are coming out, but I wouldn't
trust my life to cellphone availability.  You can radiolocate to a
cellphone signal, but it requires special equipment and skills that are
not all that common.  The &quot;James Bond&quot; direction finders only work that
well in the movies.  In real life it takes enough skill to track down
radio signals that it is considered a sport.  See http://www.homingin_dot_com
for more info on this.

I'm amazed at reports that people are heading out to the back country and
being surprised when their cellphone doesn't bring instant assistance.
The ability to communicate is not a replacement for knowing where you are!
