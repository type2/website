Yes, the BG on top of the SWR, you can see it where the Beige Grey has worn
off in places on the roof.&gt;&gt;
 
My 1965 Westy two tone was painted the same way. The dash and all inside
surfaces were painted the top color (blue white), while the entire exterior
was first painted the bottom color (Velvet green) then the belt line was
masked off and the top was painted blue white. Also it looks like the doors
were painted the top color first and then the bottom color. The factory mask
lines and areas of overspray tell a good story of how the bus was painted.
