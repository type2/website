Subject: Re: looking for '67 Westy
Date: Thu, 29 Oct 1998 22:21:12 PST



&gt;Hi,
&gt;
&gt;This is my first posting. I'm looking for my first VW, a '67 Westphalia
&gt;pop-top. I'd prefer a walk-through, garaged rust-free original. Not 
really
&gt;looking for a mint show-piece, I want to have fun with it. No projects
&gt;please. Anyone with ideas or leads please contact me. Thanks!
&gt;
Hi. Where are you located? Just saw a bus that is a 64 to 67 (didnt 
check into the year) that might meet your requirements. From texas, 
little to no rust, westy poptop. Owner is casual about it, local bus 
freak is nuts about it. Sitting in Olympia, wants $3000 and a 67 bug.
