Subject: Re: [VB] RE: parts from dealers

I actually work in the parts department of a Volkswagen dealership, and we
tend to get a couple of aircooled requests each week, which get forwarded to
me.  The biggest problem is that our electronic parts catalog, ETKA (of
which I imagine about half of the people on this list have a bootleg copy)
only lists parts back to '68 for buses and we aren't cool enough to get an
old school paper catalog.  We can look up parts for old Beetles, back to '49
so if the part is the same as a Beetle or early bay, we can find it that
way.  We can also try to track down any 9-digit part number if a customer
has that.  Prices range too - I got a call about a shift lever (the part
that sticks out of the floor and the knob screws onto the top), and our cost
on the thing was around $60, of course we ordered in a key blank for an old
Beetle and it was around $2 so it goes both ways.  I would be delighted to
look up any aircooled parts, but someone may need to stay on hold for a
couple of minutes (our hold music is tolerable for the first 10-12 seconds)
or we can call right back with price &amp; availability.  The number is
417-831-8080.  You'll have to ask for Matt in parts (ext. 128).

Happy Busing,
