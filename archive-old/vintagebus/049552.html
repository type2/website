Subject: Re: [VB] Discontinuation of the VW Ads site.

How long has Kevin been on the List? How long has Erin? Who is the more
'valuable' poster?

Who the f*ck cares!

If you don't like Erin's posts, DON'T READ THEM!!!!!  If you don't like
another Listees attitude, DON'T READ HIS / HER POSTS!
If you feel compelled to knock someone Who the HELL made you List Police?
There have been posters on this List who have been taunting, baiting, smug
and condescending, indulging in the worst neenerneenerneener &quot;I have it you
don't&quot; behavior - Erin was trying to HELP OTHERS OUT, and this is
considered egotistical???


I, for one, only wish I had the time and money to retrieve the cars Erin
digs up (or Rex Rogers drags home for free :P).
