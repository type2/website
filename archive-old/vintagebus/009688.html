I can't speak for anyone but myself; however. From my viewpoint here in
Northern Illinois, any bus that can be salvaged and returned to the road is
worth consideration.
The thought of someone taking a '50's bus and hacking it into a mutant is
not only an engineering blunder, but a waste of a valuable resource. Yes, it
is his bus, and Yes, it has been fun to see the responses this bizarre
exercise has precipitated.
I can count on one hand the number of split buses left in my immediate area,
and most of those have suffered from the midwestern climate. My bus friends
around here all groan when someone suggests one or another ill considered
modification.
Remember when we saw them everyday? Remember when we could buy them from
dealers and off used car lots?
I do and those days will never come again.
Let's save what we have and leave the urge to torch to something deserving,
Pinto's, Pacers and their ilk.
One man's trash is another man's driveway.
