I can hear the keyboards clicking furiously now;o)  The correct way to lower
your bus would be to swap for lowered spindles in the front and a lowering
kit for the rear that would eliminate the redux boxes.  This would get you
 a 3 1/2&quot; drop.  The reason it's the corrrect way is because all of it
can be un-done if you ever change your mind, and the ride is better and
safer
than pulling leafs from the beam.  You'll also need a type1 or 3 trans.
I'm sure you'll get more detailed info from others.  Good luck.
