well,

I put the engine back in and that was a treat. It was very easy *except* i
had gasoline running down my arm :( damn vise grips fell off the hose.

Decided i wanted my OG shutoff valve back.. so... I drained the whole tank
to put in my shutoff valve, and laid down in a puddle of gasoline,
oops. but the nipple on the 67 tank was frozen to the tank.. *sigh* cant
use my blowtorch on that one to break it free, hehe. guess i'll have to
put in that big baywindow tank and put the shutoff valve on it.

I put on one of those cheapie empi extractor things (single quiet pack
bolted to a header) i really like it except for the ground clearance you
loose. Much quieter than my quad monza and the exhaust exits in the right
place, albeit on the passenger side instead of drivers side.

I got my OG 40 horse aircleaner sandblasted and repainted, its pretty much
ready to reassemble except for painting the clips silver...

Put in my Advanced Auto Parts $10.00 special gas charged shocks.  I really
like em so far, they are white and beefy (look like gas adjust only 1/3
the price.)  So far they ride great.

The new throwout bearing i bought is bad out of the box :(  I spun it at
the FLAPS and thought it sounded funny but figured i was overreacting...
but i wasnt, it makes funny noises when i press in the clutch...  Since
the engine is so easy to pull, maybe i'll go yank it at the store this
saturday and put the new one in on their parking lot, hehe. So i guess
with braziliomexican parts, one must inspect closely at point of purchase
to avoid this fate...

Coming up next... replace drivers side lower outer redux box bearing,
replace drum, center steering wheel, grease and adjust king/link pins.
replace brazillian h30/31 with german 34 pict 3 and matching dizzy in
search of better fuel mileage.

take care,

Steve

p.s. i am having a pool-party this saturday anyone in the saint louis area
who wishes to come p-mail me. Only requirement is if you have a running
aircooled volkswagen you have to drive it there.
