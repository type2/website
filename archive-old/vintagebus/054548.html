&gt;   Hi Jamie, sounds like you have a '61-'62 only
&gt; front seat back.  My '61
&gt; westy has one
&gt; and the PO put one in my '59 SC.  Seems to me they
&gt; have more value &amp;
&gt; comfort.  
&gt; Anyone else
&gt; with more knowledge?

Lou, 

I don't know about more knowledge, but you're right it
was a two year only seat, and, until I overcame my
diametrically challenged state recently, I put one in
my '59 camper for more breathing room.

JP
