Hey gang,

The aluminum moulding on my 67 deluxe is very badly dinged and dented from
when the PO removed the cargo door check straps and would let the door swing
open and pinch the moulding.  Same goes for the other cargo door where the
&quot;inner-door&quot; would hit the outer edge of the &quot;outer-door&quot;.  Know what I
mean?  What I' m wanting to know is can they be repaired or do they need to
be replaced?  Also, anyone polish their own body trim?  What'd you use and
how'd you do it?

thanks
pete
