I was wondering how you guys are defining &quot;original&quot;. I like the idea of what you
are doing but think this could be difficult. We have our own small time show up in
the PNW and would love to know what guidelines you are using to define original? I
have two cars that look fairly original on the surface but have lots of mods like
bigger motors, dual carbs, etc... They can't all be expected to be original engine,
matching number type vehicles can they? I am just wondering how you are planning on
dealing with this grey area?
thanks in advance,
