Hi guys and gals, I'm trying to figure out what color our bus is(was). This is what I
know, 57 standard(?) type 2/23 chasis #232 529

I've checked all over the web and can't find any thing that seems to match the current
paint. I belive that it's original paint in the cab, or a very through repaint. I have a
pic from under the front mat here, http://www.geocities_dot_com/surfbug63/Mvc-014f.jpg To me
it looks like a pale yellow, but from the one source I have (copy of a factory workshop
manual) it lists the color combos for this model as sand/palm green, sand grey, and
red/brown. Nothing even close to whats on there. But I was looking through said manual,
and in the back it lists paint codes for all colors and one of those on there is LKF63 and
LKE63 Post Office Yellow glossy and semi-glossy. Could I have an old Post Office Bus?! I
tried looking for information on these two codes and came up empty again.

Can anybody help??

Thanks
matt souza
