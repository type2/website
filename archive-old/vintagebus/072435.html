Subject: Re: [VB] Intro to List

To figure out which bus You need or would be happy with, start by asking
your self what purpose you intend for it 
-------------------- Clip ------------------------
The best way to select your bus is to go to a toy store and buy every VW
Splittie, Combi, Vanagon Matchbox   other brands too of toy version you
can find.
Then go to E bay and try to find the ones not at the toy store.
After you've done this you will have met the requirements for cash outlay
on vans and you'll have a nice selection to choose from.
If you think the Toys are expensive then you'll know what it's like
having the real thing.
If I don't throw a $100.00 a week at my splittie it is indeed a rare
thing.
