Subject: Re: [VB] 6 volt jump-starting
References: &lt;200001061738.KAA03620_at_green-dome.village_dot_org&gt;

I've jump started my 6 volt Westy from a 12 volt unit on a tow truck and
suffered no subsequent problems.
I made sure the truck operator unhooked the jumper as soon as the engine
caught,
and things worked fine.

&gt; So the &quot;dead battery&quot; subject reminded me of a problem I've not yet
&gt; had, but fully expect to encounter some day: needing a jump on the 6
&gt; volt microbus.  Doing that from a 12 volt vehicle just won't work
&gt; (well, it'll probably start, but it'll also blow all the indicator
&gt; lights).  I have my doubts regarding random jump-start services.  Any
&gt; suggestions?
