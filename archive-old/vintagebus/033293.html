Subject: Fri: Chitty Chitty Bang Bang - Back fire Woes...
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

Need to ask the list if the back fire that I can command from 1600 DP is a 
bad thing or not. Usually when the bus is cold or been running awhile after 
its hot and I rev and I can bang bang out a few rather loud (if planned, 
funny) back fires. What is the cause of this anyway. Incedently, my 67 Westy 
has a modified tail pipe. The tail pipe stops (Cut) straight down under the 
bumper not out below the left rear quarter. 

Should I stop doing this noise - how. Is it a too rich of a mixture ?

Thanks 

Virge
67 Westy
