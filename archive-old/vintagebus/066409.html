Subject: RE: [VB] Cleaning seats etc 

3M makes a great cleaner/polish, that's what I have used in all my old
crusty buses, works great by hand or buffer. I get it at my auto paint
supply store, comes in a black can, You can also come to BBB and win one, we
usually raffle off six of them (cans of polish) not crusty buses!

Ya, my sweetie used up my tin of polishing stuff  to polish a canoe (dammit)

and tossed the can, so I am not sure what is the best stuff to get.  Any 
suggestions?  Ya I want the fine stuff for polishing original paint and 
aluminium trim and that kind of thing.

&lt;&lt; Clara, I think what you need is &quot;polishing compound&quot;. 
 It's finer than the other stuff.
