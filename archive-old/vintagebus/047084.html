Subject: 53-58 rear splash pan seals?
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

Anyone know where to find these?
These are the splash pans that go on the rear bumper at the sides inbetween 
the brackets, bumper, and body.
I have one NOS one if someone needs to know what it looks like.
Lots of people need these.
Thanks-
Greg
