&gt;  so if any of you

&gt; took place less then 2 month's ago.

check the wrecking yards for their car sales.  Pick-Your-Part, sells chairty
donations for the charitys and keeps 10%.  Those are the &quot;runners&quot; that are
parked in front as you walk in.  Ask if they have any other soon to come out
from in the back.  Be persistant and you will find it.  Should sell for under
$1000.  I doubt that the wrecking yard would know a Binz from a (dang what
rhymes with Binz?)...

Came across a complete '83 BMW with 46K miles.  Was a doctor's second car and
spent most of its life under a carport down by the ocean (which accounted for
the shiny paint with rust holes in the corners) [I spoke with the Dr and
confirmed this].  Drove and had no problems, they wanted $650 to drive it away.

These donated cars receive salvage titles which will clear the slate for the new
owners as far as back registration (in some cases can exceed the value of the
car).  One just needs to get a smog cert at a test only station (not needed
here) and brake and light certifications.

Happy Hunting
