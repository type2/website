I need to start learning more about my  '67 Camper. I want to start
restoring the interior and thinking about a paint job, but I know nothing
about my Camper. I only learned recently that it was a 12volt and that's
only because of the Bus List. I have a few technical manuals but they don't
really discuss VW models and styles. I don't have the time to go to VW meets
becuase I'm always gone on weekends to horse shows.

Thanks,
Tara &amp; Scuba (the Lab)
'67 Camper
