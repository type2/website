Here's one for the minutia lords.

It appears to me that the metal trim ring INSIDE the speedometer and the metal trim ring INSIDE the deluxe clocks are painted the same color.  Said color also appears to be the same as the paint used on the cargo/camper area on the SO-23 Westfalias.  This is the green/gray color that is close to Mango Green but not the same.  I've  discovered after looking at my bus and also numerous other SO-23 campers (Todd S's to name one) that regardless of the exterior colors, i.e. Sealing Wax Red/Beige Grey or Mango Green/Sea Gull Grey, the rear camper interior color is this greenish-grey color.

Long story short, I want to respray the trim rings on my speedo and clock, and was curious if anyone knew what this color is?  I'm also planning on respraying the interior camper area of the bus, at least around the window openings and rear hatch.  If anyone doesn't know, then I'll be coming up with as close a match as possible, in case anyone is interested in the recipe.  My painter is a master matcher so it shouldn't be too hard, but if someone already has a color code it will save some time.

Robert
