Subject: RE: [VB] Bus Depot Order Follow-Up

&gt;  I took folks advice about calling to check availability of parts that I
needed soon.
&gt; Young man on the phone was polite and informed me (8 Nov) that the
Jackpoint I
&gt; needed was  available for shipping.  Well,  today I thinking &quot;it was
available&quot; it should
&gt; be here by now.  Guess what, the order was cancelled and I WAS NOT
CONTACTED.


Dave,

It was actually recently (December, not November) when you placed the order.
Perhaps the jackpoint sold out between the time that you called to check
stock, and the time that your order was entered/processed.  If there are
only one or two of an item in stock, this can of course happen.

That said, it is not true that you were not contacted.  In fact, I can even
tell you WHEN you were contacted. At approximately 5 pm E.S.T. on Friday,
December 14, Mike left a message on your voice mail to say that the item was
out of stock for at least a month, and that you'd be best off re-ordering.
Before doing this, he spent quite a while calling around to other
distributors first, in the hope that he could still locate one for you
elsewhere and have it dropshipped to you at our additional expense.  But
unfortunately all of our suppliers were also out of stock, since the
backorder originated from the manufacturer.  When he left that message, he
immediately documented in your customer file both the date and the reason
for his call to you, which is why I know all of this with such certainty. (I
have been insisting that my employees do so, just so I can check up on this
sort of complaint. So I researched it and indeed found the record of the
call. I even spoke to Mike myself just to be absolutely sure and he
specifically remembered leaving the message.)

Then, when you called today, Paul (whom you spoke to this time) also told
you that Mike had previously tried to contact you about it, since he saw and
repeated to you the same documentation that I am reading now.  So before you
sent this email, you ALREADY know that we HAD in fact tried to reach you
about this.

Perhaps you inadvertantly overlooked or erased the message on your machine
or voice mail, or if there is more than one member of your household,
perhaps someone else got it and forgot to pass it on to you.  I would also
be more than happy to confirm your phone number with you via p-mail if you
think there is any possibility that we have it wrong (although this would be
a long shot).

So, I do apologize for any inconvenience caused by the fact that the item
sold out.  I do understand your disappointment.  But we did attempt to
contact you about it, and in fact left you a message.
