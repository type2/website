&gt; Hello,
&gt; I am trying to get an extractor type exhaust system that goes under my back
&gt; bumper. I have a GT Sports System that Rocky Mntn. Motorworks advertises as
&gt; working on a bus, but in Fact it would require my bumper to be up 2&quot; blocking
&gt; the engine door. Any ideas?

Mark,

I have Bugpack headers with glasspack mufflers on both my type 2s. The
part numbers are: header - 2031-10
muffler - 2540

I use these exhaust systems because they don't interfere with anything
on the bus. This is the only extractor system I have found that I can
say that about, and I've been through a few. I got mine from NOPI out of
Atlanta since I live in the East and they came to $88.00 each delivered
to my house. No affiliation etc., just a happy customer.

They're also reasonably quiet.
