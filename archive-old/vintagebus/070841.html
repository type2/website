Subject: air duct seals - where to find them?

I decided that since winter in fast approaching, that I should replace the
seals in my overhead air duct.  The story is pretty much that they are
non-existant.  I found the seal that goes around the big metal flap at WW
(part number 211817757)  I just need the cover seal and the seals for the two
side flaps that direct the air.  Anyone know where to get these or what the
part numbers are?
