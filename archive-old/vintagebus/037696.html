 Hi Volks,
 Can I use the hardware from a late model bus' middle seat for my '66?
 Or does anyone have hardware lying around that I can buy?  Thanks
  &gt;&gt;
yes, except that the later clamps over the seat legs have pins for the holes 
in the later seat's feet , so grind the bumps off with a grinder and you are 
good to go.

hm... there are several lengths of seat bolts too, but I think the later ones 
work on the early seats.
