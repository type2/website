Subject: RE: [VB] new aftermarket crankshaft pulley/test fit results

That pulley sounds great! Well worth the effort I am
sure. Sounds like it's may only be good for a baja!

&gt;   I just went out to the shop and tried to install
&gt; the oversize pulley on a
&gt; stock 1600, here's what I found
&gt; 1. When pulley is fully installed it hits the back
&gt; of the crank pulley tin
&gt; where it rises in the rear.
&gt; 2. The side tabs will need to be trimmed in order to
&gt; clear the outside of
&gt; the pulley.
&gt; 3. The breast plate will need to be trimmed
&gt; extensively to clear the pulley
&gt; 4. In order to install a belt you either would need
&gt; to 1. remove pulley to
&gt; install belt, or 2. trim total bottom of pulley tin
&gt; off in order to
&gt; replace/install belt.
&gt; 5. From my fitting I have come to the conclusion
&gt; that this is an item meant
&gt; for the people that love to read magazines and take
&gt; there advice as gospel. 
&gt; This would be good for a high torque engine that
&gt; runs at low RPM's to help
&gt; speed up the fan for better cooling at low RPM's
&gt; 6. Not worth the time or trouble on a bus engine
&gt; 7. Spend your money on a type 3 tight finned
&gt; doghouse oil cooler
