&lt;&lt; How often should a fuel pump be cleaned out and or rebuilt? &gt;&gt;
Hi Chris,
There are at least trains of thought on that subject.
1.  Carry a spare new or rebuilt fuel pump or at the least the rebuild kit 
(If the fuel pump is of the type that can be rebuilt) or enjoy a long wait or 
walk to your FLAPS.  Then only rebuild/replace the fuel pump when it goes out.
2.  Rebuild the fuel pump or at least go through it to check for 
wear/tear/corrosion just before or while rebuilding the engine or installing 
a new or unknown engine.  This way you are almost certain to have one less 
thing go wrong while trying to break in and adjust a new or rebuilt engine.
  
  Make sure to examine the pivot rod, lever, and spring for wear and 
especially the last item for corrosion that will cause it to break.  Check 
fuel pump diaphram for any cracking or pin holes and replace if any are 
found.  While removing the fuel pump from the engine look/smell for extremely 
stong fuel oder.  This and checking the oil dipstick for high concentrations 
of fuel oder often points to either a bad fuel pump diaphram leaking into the 
case or too high of fuel pump pressure due to incorrect fuel pump rod hieght 
causing the carb shut off valve and float to be pushed down and open.  If 
either of these are not causing the fuel in the engine case oil it is 
probably a problem with the carburator allowing too much fuel into the P&amp;Cs 
and thusly washing away the lubricating oil there and getting past the rings 
into the engine oil.   Eric&amp;Barb
