Subject: panels

As someone else mentioned, I used the 
1/8&quot;D X 8'-0&quot;L X 4'-0&quot;W sheets they have at the big box stores.

Sometimes called &quot;doorskins&quot; because I believe they use them to redo hollow interior doors in houses.

I cut with a 35 dollar B&amp;D jigsaw fairly cleanly and easy on the curves. Faster speeds seem to have helped lessen &quot;blowouts&quot; in the composite wood.

Recommendation: Get some beading to go around the edges, provides a nice finished look and hides your funky cuts. (you will have some funky cuts)

I finished mine with boiled linseed oil which was cheap and looked good to me.

Billy
