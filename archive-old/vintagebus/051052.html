&gt;here's the kicker--the compression: #1 175; #2 175; #3 185; #4 180. now my
&gt;compression gauge is reading about 15 pounds when released, but even if
&gt;15lbs is deducted from those numbers, it's still awfully high to me. i'm at
&gt;sea level.

Get a test with an accurate gauge. If your compression is this high,
try aviation fuel or solid rocket propellant, OR  reset the CR.
