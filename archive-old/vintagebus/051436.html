Have you checked Lowe's for the screws?  I bought Screws for my 66 Bus to
fit the Decklid and doors from there.  The heads are rounded, instead of
flat.

&gt; I ended up going to Sears and buying an impact driver to take the screws
&gt; out. And I must say WOW!! It was so easy with this little tool, it even
took
&gt; out the ones I stripped. But I have a new question. Where can I get new
&gt; screws? I have searched the local hardware stores and can not find a match
&gt; in size and threads. Any online vendors sell these?
