Subject: Re: [VB] Perhaps a dumb questuon

I would agree that, this time, it's prolly better to let the buddy do it,
but for about $50 worth of the correct tools, and doing it a couple times
(I'm assuming you have a splitty), you can have that engine out or in, in
less than an hour. With all the extra crap hanging from my engine, I still
do it in/out in 45 minutes, including hanging the bumper and trim piece.
But I've been practicing for 30 years, and I've got the exact tools
to do it, including a small Sears floor jack ($30 back in 1985) and the
ratcheting 17mm Sears wrench, plus the glued-in upper bolts, etc.

&gt; A few thoughts.  Do you want it done quickly?  Let him do it.
&gt; If you've never done it before, it is a lot of work.  $200
&gt; seems like a bargain.  Then again, $200 is a lot of money
&gt; just to pull everything out and reinstall.
