Subject: 58 and earlier shift rod and hanger needed
Message-ID: &lt;4cc85653.24887d82_at_aol_dot_com&gt;

Hi everyone,
I have a friend who is in need of all the shift rod and hanger parts from 
tranny to shifter for a 56 panel.
If anyone is parting out or has the parts laying around it would be greatly 
appreciated.

Thanks
