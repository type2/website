&gt; It appears to be dying a painful death. Probably because the nazi admins
&gt; keep kicking people off.

I'm sure that's the reason. Yeah.

The last administrative removal at all was in mid November, 2003 for
posting virus warnings.  And that wasn't even to the vintagebus list.


The last administrative removal from vintagebus was 11/4/03, removing a
majordomo (mailing list manager) that someone maliciously subscribed.
