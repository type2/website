&lt;&lt; Will I have a problem using the stock '62 oil bath air cleaner with my 
stock 1600 DP.  A friend mentioned that it might restrict too much with the 
DP.  Not sure since I've only run single ports up till this motor.  Maybe a 
jet change? &gt;&gt;
Hi Steve,
It should work fine if you do change the carb jetting to match it and do not 
drag race it over 4,000 RPM.  When ever you change the air cleaner or muffler 
and/or move the engine from one type of engine compartment to another 
rejetting is required.
