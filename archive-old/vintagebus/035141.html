&lt;&lt; I am looking for good mpg and longevity.  I have noticed different threads
 mentioning things like what material the cases are made of and cracks.  Are
 these cracks typical in certain areas of the case or is one case weaker than
 others in some respects?&gt;&gt;
Hi John,
First check cases where the # 3 cylinder bore in the case meets the forward
end of the engine case for cracks and look for any signs of loose connecting
rods banging around inside of the case.
&gt;From what we have heard from the hot rodders and racers the AE cases are the
best.  Due to less magnesuim and thusly more aluminuim in thier alloy making
it stonger, less prone to softening when over heated and having the head
studs pull out.  Since you are not going to race, but will probably be
driving up long hills with heavy loads you might want to look for a AE case
or any of the other A? cases will probably do well since these apparently all
have more aluminuim than the earlier single relief cases.  Also the dual
relief cases have much bigger oil passages and a better system of keeping an
even flow of oil pressure to the bearings.  It is a good idea to pull out the
case plugs and check all of the oil passages in the dual relief cases to make
sure they were completely drilled through properly.  We and friends of ours
have found some oil passages only partially drilled through and even one
doghouse cooler stand completely blocked due to not being drilled all the way
through at the factory.  Apparently somewhere during the very late 1960s to
early 1970s while VWs alloys and engineering improved as always.  The
workforce at VAG (VW of Germany.) was changing as the meticulous old school
German machinists left they were replaced by workers from Iran of all places
and thusly the quality of the machining dropped.  The same thing is happening
in Japan now.  Most of the kids coming out of school over there do not want
to work in the factories and instead want to become bankers or stock brokers.

Well we are happier with single port heads ourselfs, but others are happy
with dual port heads.  We do not like the stock dual ports due to thier
tendancy to crack from the valve seats to the spark plug holes due to too
thin of casting and driving in hot weather hard and suddenly turning off the
engine without letting it idle for a couple of minutes.  Without the fan
running the heads cool unevenly and crack.  Which is why Claudes Buggies went
to VW of Brazil and contracted with them to have special dual port heads made
that were thicker to prevent cracking which means they require longer than
stock plugs to reach the combustion chamber with these heads.  Also there is
the fact that the stock intake manifolds for dual port heads make it harder
to get to half of the plugs and also has two extra rubber seals (Which the
single port manifold do not have these.) that if they crack or not sealed the
head nearest the leaking seal will lean out, overheat and burn valve/s.
