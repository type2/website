For reference, I bought the &quot;new&quot; Wolfsburg West bumpers.  The from was 
$300, the back ~$250, and that was for the whole shootin' match - overriders,
bows, nuts &amp; bolts, everything minus brackets.  I was kinda disappointed 
with the front, but the back is nice.  THe other downsides are the
cheap-a** super-tiny washers they provide - they are not usable.  The
bumpers themselves are significant;y thinner than original.

THey were bare metal, except for the front had some crappy glopped-on
primer.  I woulda rather it was bare, but they prolly primed it like
that to hide the poor stamping.
