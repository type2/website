&gt; Doesn't seem to me that a dirt floor would make a difference as long as it's
&gt; dry, am I wrong? 

Hi Ronnie,
Correct!  We dug in the late 1970s by hand a full basement under a house 
built in 1911.  Due to the dirt under being kept dry by the house over it we 
were able to find paper items burried in the dirt from the 1911-1930ish era.
