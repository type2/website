Subject: Re: [VB] Friday~ bought another water pumper!

&gt; You're another one to talk, Meanley! Fat Chick owner/driver that you are.

Ouch!!! now that hurts ; ) just cause my women and buses fall into the same
catagory (kidding Lori, just kidding)
and thats Fat Chick FLEET owner/driver, 68,72,77 at least in my defense I
own at least one running split. Would kill to be at Havasu and refresh my
memory as to what sun looks like but the 68's engine remains complete but
unmounted due to our last few weeks of rain/snow/sleet/wind/power outage,
but at least its a change from you poor AZ's and your constant humdrum days
of sun &lt;grin&gt;

I'l let you be the midnight cowboy of az and stick to being a
redneck(whiteneck?) canucker. The differance in case you didnt wonder is
instead of a gun rack in the pickup, we have chainsaws big enough to run
large motorcycles.

 The horror would be if I
&gt; ever ended up with a vehicle (that I drive) that has both A/C, is not
black and
&gt; has the power to get out of it's own way.

I wonder if theres something in our genes that causes us to be packrats,
picked up this past weekend anouther '64 dodge pickup. This one is a parts
doner for the other '64 which is big, black, ugly and can deffinately get
out of its own way (no a/c tho) hell this is the frozen north after all.
This one has a 4spd to replace the others 3spd and has the pto takeoff for
the inevitable 4wd conversion, with the added plus of a seat not duct taped
together and windshield wipers.
ah well hope you all have a great time at BBB and if the Gods shine on us
we'll be down for Jerome to pick up the long distance award.
