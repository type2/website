&gt; Kevin,
&gt;         Please pmail me if you get a good answer on this.  Do you have a Sundial or an EZ camper (I cant remember)?

I got the number for Hehr International: 323-663-1261
Located at 3333 Casitas Avenue, LA, CA.

 They told me they didn't sell direct, and I had to get the parts from their dealer/reseller, All-Rite, in Hollister,CA, 800-642-9988.

All-Rite told me my window part number was too short, that it should be 13-15 digits, and that I would be able to find that number inside the window(as opposed to the logical placing of a part number on the outside for easy reference). I took the window partially aprt this morning. No other numbers could be found.  

I plan on calling Hehr again, and I'll update y'all(does that sound Texan) on the process.
