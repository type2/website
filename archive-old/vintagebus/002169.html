&gt; As far as I have heard, Goodguys will not have any VW shows this year.
There
&gt; is nothing listed on their website, nor has anything been advertised in
the
&gt; national magazines.
&gt; I used to love going to the Bug Bash in Pleasanton back in the late 80's.
Oh
&gt; well, if anyone knows anything different let me know.
