Hi David,

At home off-list at the moment and I've found
somethibng sorta weird that might be Oz bus
specific around the 63 changeover period.

I'd ask the list but not subscribed from here
so I was wondering if you could ask...

What is the diameter of 'early' and 'late'
link pins?  do I remeber correctly at 20 mm and 22 mm
respectively?

Thanks!

RobK
