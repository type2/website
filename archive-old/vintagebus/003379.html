I have noticed a few posts about bus covers.  Since my own bus is going to
have to stay outside all winter, I am concerned about keeping it as
sheltered as possible.  When I read in Dan Morris' post that he was going to
spend $250 for what he called a cheapo pvc cover I thought I would see what
I could come up with.  After all, an old plumbing contractor should be able
to design something out of pipe for less that that.

Anyway, I got some bus measurements from Thom's site, and went to work.  I
have designed a frame 20 feet long by 8 feet wide by 7 feet tall with a 10
foot highest point for the pitched top.  It is made from 1' schedule 40 pvc,
which I think should be strong enough, but you could use larger pipe for
additional strength if worried about wind or snow load.  Just remember
larger costs more.  I estimate the pipe and fittings will cost less than
$100.  In addition there will be the cost of a tarp or some kind of cover of
your choice.  One of those cheap blue things to make a roof (you could try
for sides also, but I am not sure the cost is justified) should be less than
$50 so I predict a savings of $100 over the purchased kit.

I think this is large enough to keep the tarp from rubbing the car in the
wind, and even work on the engine under a shelter is you are so inclined.
Of course if your camper is a bit taller the legs can be lengthened.  Such a
shelter will not keep the dirt etc that may settle on the bus off, but it
will keep the moisture away.

If you are interested let me know and I will see if I can figure out how to
attach my drawing to an e-mail.  The drawing was done with Word Perfect 8,
but I can probably figure out how to convert it to some of the other
formats, or maybe you can tell me how.
