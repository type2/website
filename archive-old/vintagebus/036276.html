 But hey, that's not what I'm writing about....  I pulled the speaker out and
 noticed that it had some form of screen in front of it... was this from the
 factory or had the last owner put window screen in front of the speaker to
 keep trash out?  What is supposed to be there?
 
 
 Thanks

yes- they did come with a cloth mesh between the speaker and the metal grills 
on the dash.  found them on several stock installs.  cloth actually goes 
around the front of the radio - between radio &amp; dash- as well
