&gt;
&gt;Where do you come up with these colors? 
&gt;
&gt;All the literature I have or have seen says rims and bumpers were
&gt;originally colored Silver White (L-82) as well as the front emblem on
&gt;commercials.
&gt; If you have info to the contrary, I would be interestd in hearing more
&gt;about it.
&gt;-- 

I'm going from a current crossrefrenced german RAL 840-HR (the HR stands
for semi-gloss)color source book for the powder coat industry. The pigments
used in powdercoating need to be more heat-stable than pigments for paint.
Also the resin used for powder coating has a different base color than most
paint resins so the pigment loading has to be adjusted accordingly.

By the way I work in the lab for a custom color company making colors for
plastics. Alas we don't make Powder Coat colors , but I do have the source
books for them.

Personally I think that of the two the RAL 9003 (Signal White) is the best
match to L-82.

I should have clarified my response to the list but I was busy and sent it
off quickly.
