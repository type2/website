Subject: Re: [VB] Fixing broken hubcap clips.

Yes I know they are supposed to be riveted on but I'm lazy and I'm looking
for an easy repair that doesn't require a welder, a drill, a chisel, etc.
My friend Terry uses nuts and bolts on his and they've never vibrated loose.
I put loctite on mine.  So I guess even if they do loosen up, it'll give me
something to do at a campout or bribe someone to do for me. (Here ya go
guys - each of you has a tire, now when I say go, who can get their hubcap
clips tightened up the quickest.  The winner doesn't have to help put the
tires back on.) :-)

Indeed I riveted mine on the first time - even the factory way.  Never
again - too time consuming - only to have the damn things break off again.
Forget it man, ease of replacement is for me.
