Subject: Re: [VB] Sandblasting Prices

Wow!  $400 sounds great!  I was quoted $800 (including primer) for my 
panel bus here in San Diego.  Maybe I should tow my bus to Havasu?

&gt;Just got back from showing the safari bus to the local sandblaster to get a
&gt;quote. He wants $400.00 to do the whole bus with walnut shells.  He is
&gt;charging me an extra $100.00 because previous owner  had painted stripes on
&gt;about 3/4's of the bus with house paint, said this was the hardest to take
&gt;off. It looks like there is about 5 different colors on the bus, price
&gt;includes doing both bumpers also. How does this compare with other areas?
&gt;I'm going to have him do the blasting next Wed. He said no warpage at all
&gt;with walnuts and the finish comes out great.  Check out article on BBBVI in
&gt;May Hot VW's.
