These guys can be found at www.sciplus_dot_com, as well.

You didn't mention that it also comes with two mounting options: a
couple of strong magnets, or a &quot;sliding bracket&quot; for free-standing
operation.  The magnets make it an even more interesting candidate for
experimentation - we can see if it works before doing anything permanent to
the vehicle.

My only real concern with this one so far is that it's way bigger than
the existing tail light hole.  Either the result will be some
sort of Cal-look conversion, or a lot of the LEDs won't be visible
through the hole.  I suppose wrapping the whole thing up in some sort
of reflective arrangement, so the non-visible LEDs at least contribute
to an overall glow might help.  Of course, even just a third of them
is probably still brighter than what we normally get, particularly if
it's separate from the running light....

Ideally, I'd find the same thing in yellow, and use them as turn
signals and brake lights.  The existing lights would be kept for their
running-light functionality.  Obviously, extra control wires would be
needed, but this would allow me to eliminate the flasher relay
completely, and select steady/flash by which side of the unit's switch
I provide power to.  Could do a really bright third light pretty
easily, as well.

The drawbacks I see are that the dash flasher light won't flash, it'll
just come on, and the front/back turn indicators won't be
synchronized.  That'll look a little weird, but shouldn't be a
problem.

This red LED unit looks like something that should be carried by
retailers, as well.  On the same page, they have a smaller, 3 volt
flasher that you can get at most bicycle shops.  Might be worth
dropping by Auto-Zone, K-Mart, ShopKo, and the like to see if any of
them have the bigger unit, as it'd be faster than mail/web-order.
