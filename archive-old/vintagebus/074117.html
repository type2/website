Subject: Re: [VB] have stuck drum, need tool

Been there...tried that and it didn't work for me.  Pray like hell, your drum wasn't as stuck as my 63 last summer.

I went through a 8&quot;, 12&quot; and then a combo of both with no luck.  Both were three arm jaw pullers.  All of this with heat, cold, plenty of pounding and tapping over several weeks.

Tried the axle nut dealie, for about 3-4,000 miles of hard driving....nadadamnting budged.

Finally had to locate an old school heavy duty puller, made for brake drums.  I had to pound on this thing with a sledge, but the bastard finally came loose.

One other tip I came across AFTER breaking mine loose-was to find a shop that works on old jeeps, especially old willys jeeps, they had tapered splines in the drums and are notorious for getting stuck.  They may have just the puller you need.

Just make sure and grease those axle splines before putting the drum back on.

Good luck,

&gt; could somebody give me advice on a drum puller

&gt; If your van will run.
&gt; You can loosen the big nut or nuts and drive the van around the block and
&gt; it will free it up.
&gt; If it is really stubborn you can kiss a curb or two en route and break it
&gt; loose.
