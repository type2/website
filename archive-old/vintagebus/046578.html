Subject: Re: [VB] re: tire pressure/ tire markings

when I got my 61 above 7? years ago I went and got 4 matched used P 205 75 R 
15 tires.  They have a max load of 1540lbs ( it is fifteen something) and a 
max recommended pressure of 35psi.   I have put a bit over 30K on these 
tires- and the wear pattern is more at the edges than the middle of the 
tread, even though I have been running 36 to 40- psi in the back,  and about 
35 in the front.  I dont get it.  I have been running at or slightly above 
RMTP for years, yet the wear implies that I am running with low pressure.  

I have 14&quot; s on the front now-  as I had cleaned up 5 15&quot; rims for 
powdercoated, and the 185 70 14s on the front do not handle as well as the 
15s I have- the steering seems 'stickier' and harder to turn- or something, 
it was very light and easy before.  went round corners nicer too.        They 
also have 44 psi RMTP
