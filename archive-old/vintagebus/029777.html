Ok, try and follow this one. I have a new 1776 in my 60 Double Cab with dual 40mm
Webers. I have been having trouble getting the drivers side cylinders (1&amp;3 I
think) to run very well. At idle I pull the plug wires for 2&amp;4 and there is a huge
drop, I pull 1&amp;3 and almost nothing. When I go to put 1or3 back on there is a
quick surge and then back to nothing. I thought it was a bad carb due to bunged up
mixture screw inserts. I changed the carb out on that side with one that I know
works. The truck ran good for a day and then back to running bad. I pulled the
carb again and double checked all of the fuel lines and connectors, completely
tore down the carb and blew it out with cleaner and air. Reinstalled the carb and
it did not seem to make much difference at idle but it ran great again, for about
a day. It is now running bad again. Just in case I replaced the cap and spark
plugs and rotor. I am running a Pertronix ignition. No change. This is a truck
that I have been driving daily and never had any problems with junk in the tank or
anything fuel related. Fuel filter is right after the fuel line exits the tank. It
has some small stuff in it but not bad. I am going to change it and maybe even
drain the tank and replace the in tank screen tomorrow. The compression is good.
The valves are adjusted right. I was going to try a different coil (although I
don't see how that could be it). I have a hard time believing these carbs are
getting plugged up exactly the same way. (Remember this happened with two
different carbs on the same side.) This side is the closest to the fuel pump so I
would think that it would be getting the most gas if there were some problem with
the fuel pump. I am pretty sure it is the carb but I have been fooled by stuff
like this before and would be interested in any theories. Any ideas? I have only
got about 100 miles on this new engine, I am dying to get some miles on this
thing.
Thanks in advance,
