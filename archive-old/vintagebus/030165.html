BTDT...  As painless as Sears. (Actually less so.  Didn't have to hunt
for the tool department and didn't have to hunt for a clerk who
'worked' in the said department.)

That being said, If you break a 3/4 drive socket or breaker bar the
fastener is on *really* tight!

Regarding their quality; Chinese tools are worlds better quality today
than they were in 1975! In 1975 they were not seriously competing on
the world market.  Today they are. Think Japanese products in the
fifties versus Japanese products in the seventies and eighties.
