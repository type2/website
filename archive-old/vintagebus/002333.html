We have a winner!!!  Jim Arnott from Oregon guessed it best!!

    I'd like to thank everyone who e-mailed me their answers.  Lots of good
guesses among you.

The Answer:  It's a component in the arresting gear cables (those are the
big steel cables that are stretched across the flight deck that actually
grab the hook on naval aircraft as they land).

It's Purpose:  For Lubrication!!

    The arresting cables are in fact, a 7X19 style of steel cable (7 cords
with 19 strands per cord) with the center cord being made of HEMP.  The
actual reason for the hemp is primarily lubrication.  The cable is soaked in
a black tar-like lube oil which is soaked up by the hemp.  As the 40,000 -
70,000 lbs a/c catch the wire (or pennant as it's called) the hemp is
squeezed by the other steel strands as it stretches and bends around the
hook, releasing some lubrication precisely when and where it's needed.
Pretty ingenious really!!

    There are about 1,000 feet worth on each of the arresting engines
(approx. 500ft on each side).  The part that is actually stretched across
the deck is called the &quot;pennant&quot;.  The pennant is used for a maximum of ONLY
100 aircraft catches, or &quot;traps&quot; and then it is pitched overboard.  It
usually takes a deck crew 2 minutes to swap them out.

    So there you have it folks.  Jim, I'll have your sprinkler shipped in a
couple days!!

Obligatory bus content:  One of these steel/hemp cables could lift approx 85
busses at one time.  Talk about a lifetime e-brake cable. . .  ;-)
