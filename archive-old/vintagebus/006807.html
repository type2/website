My old 66 Deluxe was painted all white (top half) then the Titian red lower
half after that and you can see where the paint faded that the lower half
wasn't really painted fully white, so in my opinion VW painted the top half
first to the around the beltline then painted the lower half the contrast
color from at least 1966 on.

around late 61/ early 62 they switched to paint all the bus the upper colour

first, then the lower on top of the other.  &gt;&gt;

I would have to disagree.
My friends turkis 64 standard is fading through the roof and yuo see turkis 
paint.
There is also a shiny 13 window down here where the entire roof is almost
red 
now.
