Thanks to all who made it the success that it was. $3000.00 TO THE KIDS.
Thanks again.
Would like to hear from all who had trouble at the campground gate and who
thought the showers were trash. Reason is we could not get through to the
manager so I will print emails and forward to owner of campground. Please
pmail me. NEW SITE FOR NEXT YEAR.

Thanks again to all who showed and see you next year
\VWHoward
