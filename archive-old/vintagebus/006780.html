Off oven cleaner does the same thing, that's what the pin strip guys use to
remove old graphics

&lt;&lt;  I am still trying to keep as much of the original primer/paint as 
possible, but if I can't feather the old stuff to the point that I can't
feel 
it when I run my hand over it, it comes off. &gt;&gt;
Hi Gene,
You might want to try 3Ms &quot;Safest Stripper&quot; at your local True Value HWS.
No 
nasty fumes!  This stuff removes non-factory paint and leaves the original 
paint.  Just test some areas for how long you need to leave this on to do
the 
work for you.
