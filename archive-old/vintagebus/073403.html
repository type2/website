&gt; Well Volks,

&gt; When I took the whole fam damily down to Oz....We
travelled all over the place in Vic
&gt; and NSW in a '74 3
&gt; seat Holden &quot;station sedan,&quot; I think they called em.
&gt;  Rob?  Andy? 
&gt; Correct me if I am wrong.
I think you mean &quot;station wagon&quot;.
You probably had the model with the wind-down window
in the rear gate, right?
That model handles like a DOG!
H_at_lden's the local GM product, by the way.
 
&gt; Worked for us, with 7 kids ranging from 16 down to
&gt; 18 months back in
&gt; '85.  
7 kids, eh, Curt?
You couldn't have had a TV ;o)

As far as travelling games go, we play one in my '77
Bus(which has no radio) where you pick a word(i.e.
road, moon, black etc.) and you go around the car with
each person naming a song with the word in either the
title or lyrics.
As each person runs out of songs they drop out and the
last person has to come up with a final song after the
2nd last has dropped out to prove their superiority.
Being a music teacher gives me a good edge, however my
wife is also a keen muso &amp; when we travelled with the
country band we were in last year they pulled out
tunes from artists I'd never even heard of &amp; I knew
they weren't lying.
Basically if you're a keen listener of any
genre(classical &amp; opera included) or have a big
general knowledge of music you have a good chance of
winning at least once a trip.
Plus, based on the key word, your preferred choice of
musical genre can give you an edge.
Give it a go.
If nothing else, you find yourself remembering all the
words to those Top40 songs you SWORE were awful &amp; then
singing them to prove them to the other occupants of
the vehicle, fairly amusing depending on the song ;o)
Cheers &amp; God Bless
