I rebuilt the redux boxes so perhaps I buggered the seal. It was dry all
around the bearing cover so I thought perhaps it was something else. Looks
like I get to pull it all apart again...ughhhh

&gt; Sounds like the oil seal 'neath the bearing cover.  If you haven't
replaced it
&gt; yourself recently, go ahead and put a new one on there.  Consider doing
both
&gt; wheels.  You'll be happier later when it doesn't spring a _bad_ leak while
on
&gt; the road :-)  If you think it's messy standing still...
&gt;
&gt; If you're getting oil around the bolts holding the RGBs to the spring
plate,
&gt; ask me about rusty freeze plugs.  They're grrrrreat!
