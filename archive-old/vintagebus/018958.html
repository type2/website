Harry Houck sent a photo of a whacked 23 window...
&lt;thesamba_dot_com/vw/gallery/5334.jpg&gt;
A 23W on a Novell Brainshare brochure for 2001. What's
that on top, a radiator, oil cooler?
---------------------------------------

Been there and seen that. Old timers of the lenti era
will recall that I posted a mention of this bus in a
trip report to the 1997 Kelly Park show when the RFH
was pristine. Following our kicking a** at KP show we
stayed a few email listees along the way. Stayed with
Busgirl and the owner of &quot;Her Purple Majesty&quot; bus of
yesteryear. We had just stayed with Kathy Meyers and
Sir Blanchard. Following our stay, my wife Paula and I
were casually rolling down a Northern California
highway. We came over a crest in the road and viewed
VW mecca glistening in the morning light at the bottom
of a short twisting road. Seriously this was storybook
photo op but didnt happen to seize the shot. Crappy
camera on board. Stopped and talked to a fella who
proudly showed us all of his really whacked and hacked
modifications and guages affixed to the over head
fresh air cabinet and all over the dash. Also had a
delapidated westy rack hanging on the side of a wooden
barn structure.
Paula's early mile by mile vw journal recorded the
following:
4-8-97 XXXXX, CA 10:00 am Stopped and talked to Kevin
X, VW mechanic and checked out his '63 modified 23
window with an oil cooler on top and old school bus
&quot;STOP&quot; light mounted on the rear hatch. Cat named
&quot;Telescope&quot;. All seats in bus.

Kevin was a one time participant and cult member of
the infamous CCC (California Camping Crazies) group
from years ago. His bus was refreshingly non-stock and
completely unpretentious. He had several buses and
bugs that we'd all be interested in now-a-days. He was
not into the show and prestige sell to your Mother at
ebay price kind of a guy. Definite understated nice
guy. I felt uncomfortable being full of myself over
our recent &quot;resto&quot; as if no one else on planet earth
had ever redone a bus. Kevin was appreciative but life
would definitely go in his mind two seconds following
our departure. Real name and real location withheld
for his privacy. If you know his location and real
name please be cool and hold back for his sake. The
only thing that I'm in the market for at the moment is
transition/graduates baby food.
