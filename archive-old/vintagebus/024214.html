I have to agree with Jim.  Check out the pictures of the bus in question
again (sorry I don't have the address).  If the bus in question were a
panel, should'nt it have had the upper cargo vents along the sides.  The
bus that was pictured looked like a kombi to me....no vents evident. 
Just a thought.
