Also if you are going to remove the cover for better air flow then maybe you
should make a second set of covers made out of screen to keep the bugs out.

Hi Rocky,
Definitely using the magnetic stuff that bussinesses use for signs on thier
autos is a great idea.  That way during the summer if the vent area is not
covered by a cabinet one can remove the magnetic panels and increase fresh
air flow through the panel bus.
