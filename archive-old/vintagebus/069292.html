Subject: Re: [VB] VDO OIL GAUGE WIRING???

Dave,

I just got a new one, and it didn't come with a sheet. How's this: when
you've screwed it in sufficiently, both terminals are horizontal. The one
in front (FIF) is the light. The rear one (closest to you) is the guage.
Of course, yours may screw in differently, but I doubt it. I have a new
sealed one, model 360 - 006D (VDO) - no sheet.
