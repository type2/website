Subject: RE: [VB] Bus Virus

I find that after owning one air cooled VW, I soon bought another... oh
wait, I first bought two bugs and put them in the garage waiting for the day
to get to them and then the double cab came along... after the resto began,
the 58 ghia, then the 58 ghia coupe for parts that was too nice to part, and
then the tipper to finally have a *driver*... and then the v80...  only one
vw ever in my office building parking lot at any one time but one employee
owns an audi... just wait till my kids start to drive though.

Virus, nah, complete degradation of the brain, absolutely.  We do state of
the are sensor development based on advanced array detectors, electro
optics, thin film design, computationally intensive multivariate
statistics... and of course, I drive an air cooled VW.


Life is sweet :-)
