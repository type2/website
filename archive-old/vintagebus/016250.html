To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

Hey list,

Normally I'd keep sightings to Fridays, but this is so
rare, I thought I would ask.  Cruising out of my
apartment complex this morning, I saw a 64-66 White
over Blue Westy in Dannybrooke Apartments in
Williamsville, NY.  Any one on the list?  This is the
first split I have seen in this area since moving here
3 months ago.  I was pretty stoked.  I guess I'm going
through withdrawal, cuz I got out and looked it over
pretty good.  Looks to be in pretty good shape aside
from the poptop.  And even that was in better shape
than most tops I've seen.  Also had all the interior
parts in very good shape and the jalousie windows
looked like they were in working order as well.  I
just hope it's there tonight when I get home from
work...

Paul
