I remember seeing an ad for some type of heating element for a single cup of
water.  Would this type of thing work?  If I remember right, it was small
and didn't pull a lot of wattage, might even have been a 12v unit.  I think
it was someplace like Brookstone or the like.

&gt; &gt; Is there any way to electrically warm the water in a particular vessel?
I
&gt; &gt; have a harbor freight parts washer, which uses a water-based solition,
and
&gt; &gt; if I could warm the water, it would be MUCH more effective!
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Is there something you can immerse into it to do this?
