Subject: re: [VB] Too much grease?
To: Harry.Houck_at_ci.fresno_dot_ca_dot_us

I looked in one of my bearing/lubrication references
to refresh my memory, and found that bearings should
be filled one-third to one-half full of the proper
grease. Over-filling a bearing causes overheating of
the grease (and in turn, the bearing) due to friction
within the grease caused by churning of the grease. 
There is a formula that can be used to determine the
available volume for grease in a bearing, but I won't
get into that here.  
So, yes, it is possible to overheat bearings by
filling them too full--although I am sure that
underlubrication is a more common problem.
On many larger electric motors and other equipment
that has grease zerks for greasing bearings, there is
often a relief plug which should be opened or removed
when grease is added, so excess lubricant can escape. 
This probably leaves more than the optiimum 1/3 to 1/2
capacity of grease in the bearing, but is better than
jamming it completely full.

Hope this is of help.
