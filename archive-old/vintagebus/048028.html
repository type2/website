&lt;&lt; I've tried endlessly to correct the whistle leak without success
 until someone suggested that I &quot;stuff a sock in it&quot;. I just assumed that
 they were afflicted by the wingvent thing too and made the connection all by
 my-self. &gt;&gt;
Hi Ellis,
Well hate to say it, but due to the need to be penny wise right now we did not
want to just replace the seals that seat against the wing windows when closed.
Instead picked up a cheap stethoscope and and by removing the buisness end of
this we where able to have a small tube to listen thru for pin pointing the
leaks causing the whistle noises.  Turned out the for some reason the seal
against the rear of these windows was leaking.  Even with trying to put some
thin cardboard between the window lock and it's base to get the window tighter
there was no change in the whistle.  So we finally used the foam tape house
hold door seals material that we use for dog house tin sealing material.  Had
to carefully trim this material both width and thickness to very small
dimentions and only need it here and there applied to the glass.  Result is
that for the past year the bus is very much quiter without the darn whistles
and nobody has noticed the foam sealant with the windows either open or shut.
