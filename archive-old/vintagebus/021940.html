&lt;&lt; I heard a rumor that the best way to change the color
 of armrests was to dye them.  Does anyone have any
 info about this. &gt;&gt;

I know there is a vinyl spray paint that works fairly well.  I have seen it 
used on seats and even under this high use application it lasted two or three 
years.  Your best bet for information is to contact a professional detail 
shop in your area.
