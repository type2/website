Subject: Scarcity of parts

   Is it me or are the parts for our VW's starting to get even harder to
find?
   Today I called to get some end gears, fulcrums and a few bus axles
because I'm out and the last refurbished set I let someone else use. So I
call my usual supplier and they said SORRY NONE, I knew axles were getting
hard to find, but end gears and fulcrums, come-on. So after calling all of
my usual sources, with whom I've never had a problem, I get the same reply,
SORRY NONE. So as a last resort I call another vender who I hardly use and
they had some fulcrums and end gears. The weird part was they asked me if I
wanted good, better or best. Say what I asked and there response was that
swing axle parts are getting so hard to come by they ask how GOOD of a part
you want!.
  The next step was asking them for bus axles, they almost fell over
laughing, you want what. I said I wanted some bus axles for RGB's, again I
was asked good, better or best, I almost fell over. So the conclusion I came
to was start buying up all I can as RGB parts are getting as hard to find as
36 hp parts.

ps;. I took apart a bunch of my stash of RGB trannys only to find a couple
good (usable) parts
pps;. They do MAKE oversize fulcrums so I can send in all my damaged axles
to be surfaced for these.
ppps; I asked them if they had any BUS hockey sticks and was told,
reconditioned for 40 dollars, new 100 dollars OUCH
