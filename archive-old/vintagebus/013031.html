&gt; Also I was planning on redoing the pads, should i go with the original type
&gt; hair pad, or go with the new foam pad...what are your experiences with these
&gt; two different products. Or just any reccomendations on seat pads? What to do,
&gt; how hard is it to do myself?

I used a layer of denium cloth right on the seats, then a layer of this
stuff the local upholstery shop sold me some stuff which is almost exactly like
the &quot;Buff Puff&quot; pads that women use; on top of that went standard 
high-density upholstery foam (1 3/4&quot;) and then the seat cover.
