&lt;&lt; I asked &quot;well, if it was totalled, what would it be worth?
 Insurance Agent replies: ACV is $2,400 new in 67' minus 33 years
 depreciation minus $500 deductible is AHEM &gt;&gt;

For any of those in the Midwest, Good news!!  I just went through this same 
scenario with my insurance agent on my Binz crew cab.  After about half an 
hour at their office talking to the agent in person, and both the field agent 
and the underwriter from the regional office via phone, not only did I have 
my problem solved but I am now an approved appraiser for State Farm.  8-)  If 
anyone in or around Kansas City needs an appraisal get in touch with me.  I'm 
sure other insurance companies will accept my appraisals if State Farm will.
