I have an opportunity to buy a freshly rebuilt 40 hp for a few clams and
I was wondering if it would work ok in a bus designed to run a 1500 ('66
Deluxe with 1.26 reduction boxes). Too underpowered for the gearing?

Also, what is the deal with the rocker studs on those old 1200's. If I
pull the valve covers off, what should I look for?

If it's too much for the bus, I'll probably put it to work in the oval.

Never had a 40hp in a bus w/later gearing, only in one with the 4.37 r&amp;p, and 
the 1.30 rgears, was a little slow when loaded.   (everyone else probably 
thought a lot slow)  I would get the motor and try it out, probably you will 
find it underpowered for a 4.12 with 1.26s,  less upake that the barndoor, 
could always put it in the oval later, like you say.
