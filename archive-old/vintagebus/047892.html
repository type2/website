are you flat towing the bug ? not much weight on the ball

But if you are putting it on a trailer you need to add the trailer 
weight........

and try not to have the bug and trailer combo weigh more then the bus, most 
USA trailers do not have brakes so you areusing your bus brakes for double 
duty........
