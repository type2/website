&lt;&lt; Hello All,
                   Well I have a new question. I noticed some
 condensation on my maniifold below my carb. It was almost sweaty and
 cool to the touch. What 's this about? Thanks in advance.......Oh yeah
 the oil leak is no more. again thanks for the help on that one too. It
 defineitely made things go smoother and made me more aware of what to
 look for. All the help was invaluable.

This is because of the vaporisation of the gasoline via the carb.   it lowers 
the temp of the carb/intake throat, which causes condensation.  As the temps 
drop into the fall, you may see ice form there, which will make the VW run 
funky, until it has warmed up.   I personally have driven through oregon 
(just over 300miles) one day in the winter with thecarb iced the entire way.  
 to eliminate this proble, vw developed a carb pre heat system.  This happens 
more in cool damp climates,  I have seen condesation here in Oly WA when the 
temp outside is in the sixties,   but our normal 30s to 40s winter temps (and 
raining or 90 % humidity) means carb iceing is a daily happening, and that I 
learned that preheat does help the VW.    the stock air cleaners from 
sometime in the 40hp era have a flap on the intake that is closed at idle, 
and opens at higher rpms.  when the flap is closed, the air is drawn in 
through the other opening.  attached to the round open should be a flexible 
paper covered tube, like your fresh air tubes only smaller diameter.  this 
runs down through the rear tube, and hopefully onto the metal preheat pickup 
tube which sucks the air from directly next to the head, which of course is 
the first thing to warm up.    If you dont have a metal preheat tube, you can 
just bend the pickup flex tube forward so it rests between the push rod tubes 
and the metal tin under them, in that few inches there, between the case and 
the heater box.   
68 and later vws have a preheat pickup the same diameter as the fresh air 
tubes.
36hp motors did not come with preheat, and I had found a section about in in 
on of my 36hp era VW manual, in which VW says basically &quot;deal with it&quot;.  They 
changed their minds later  ha ha
