&gt; Hi folks,
&gt; 
&gt; right next to the sealants, was a variety of gasket materials - sheets and
&gt; rolls of gasket stuff of all different thicknesses, etc. I'm wondering -
&gt; should I get some and cut it to fit between the rdx box and spring plate?
&gt; Would it help any or would it make things worse? This is just a fixer to
&gt; keep the fluid in the tranny to give it a little longer life (it's been
&gt; without fluid - at least without the fluid that leaked from the reduction
&gt; boxes - for a couple of years, and still works fine, but I know eventually
&gt; I'll have to go for a new one

not sure if a gasket will help or not.  cleaning it up good and using sealn't can't hurt.


re oil- the RGBs are connected to the center section vis the axle tubes.   This means that even if oil is dripping out one box, it will get oil splashed in from the center section.    This is why it is not a good idea to change the center section one weekend, and do the boxes the next- that is like changing half the engine oil, then changing half agin later.  You still don't get all the old stuff out.


So do check the center  section, even the other box, as the level will go down in all three sections when it leaks out of one of them.

Trannys are pretty sturdy, and running them low on oil won't neccessarily show results right away, but best to get it sorted out before those grumbles arrive, as you are doing.

I killed a tranny y running it w/o oil.   The bus had bad boots and no oil when I got it, and I didn't know to check the boots.   It started whining about 400 miles after I got it, and I checked to oil, (none) put on new boots (mine were torn) and put in oil.  It quieted down, but the whine didn't completely go away.  I got 13,000 miles out of it, before really bad grumbles started, then another 500 or so before it totally crapped on me (I had just aquired my replacement tranny and was on the way back from the parts store to pull it)
