 How do I tell if they're 6 or 12v?    Thanks,    Pete &gt;&gt;

Hi Pete,
The stickers on the fans should say which voltage they are.  If not then 
borrow someone elses known 6 volt fans, hook them up to a 6 volt source and 
run them and your's so you can compare them.  While running a 6 volt set of 
fans on 12 volt will burn them out very soon.  Running a 12 volt set of fans 
on 6 volt will do the same over a bit longer time due to heat build up from 
inadequite voltage.    Eric&amp;Barb
PS Hopefully someone less electrically challanged might have a better test 
for this.  EE&amp;B
