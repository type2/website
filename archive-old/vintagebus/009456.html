&gt;&gt; &gt;I am curious as to what would be the best option to power my splitty 
&gt;&gt;with.
&gt;
&gt;&quot;The semantics of 'best' are beyond anything.&quot;-Muir
&gt;


&gt;Porsche 911 6 cylinder air cooled 3 liter turbo.
Scratch the Turbo part...  Way too expensive to maintain and feed.

&gt;Actually, all kidding aside, if you can afford a Porsche 911 6, this engine will give you what a bus could really use. Its almost too &gt;bad that this air cooled option isn't more readily available.
Agreed.  Now I with there was some good documentation out there to use as a template!

&gt;1. Its part of the same lineage (more or less)
Uh, I think the only thing they share is the same transmission plugs.  The Porsche 17mm tool is like $20, VW $5 :)

&gt;2. It has the torque you really could use
Yes, especially the 3.0L and 3.2L.  Very usable power.

&gt;3. Its air cooled
Love me some air-coolers!!!

&gt;4. Its proven that a well built engine like this can last and last
Amen!  The 3.0L motor can go easily over 400,000 without being torn down if properly maintained.  The 2.7L sucked, do not touch these.  3.2L is good, but the valve guides wear prematurely, but still good for at least 150,000-200,000 miles.  The smaller Porsche engines are getting expensive because of lack of some parts, go with the 3.0L because these are the most common engine and parts are affordable and easy to find.

Now if Porsche could build a decent transmission!  The 901 and 915 suck, mostly because they have a short life span!  And you do not want to pay for a G60 transmission.

The 3.0L and 915 tranny could be had for $2-3K used if you shop hard.  I am going to try and find a wrecked/burned/trashed 1978-1979 911 SC for my bus donor for the tranny, and engine. The wheels need to come from an early 911 due to their width, need 5.5 inches to fit under stock bus metal.  Also you may want to rip the 915 tranny apart and change the gearing to 7.32 to increase low end grunt, autocrossers do this for more low end pull in turns.  Granted this hurts top speed, but who wants to go over 80-85MPH in a bus anyhow?  

One day.  Come on Lotto!!!
