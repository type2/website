Subject: christmas shopping surprize

Ok, I'll admit it, I hate shopping and especially Christmas shopping. Its
like having a sore tooth and fingernails on a chalkboard at the same time.
So tonight while the significant other buzzes from one over priced store to
the next like a humming bird on speed, I try to go along to keep the peace,
plus not wanting to cook for myself. When I hear for probably the hundredth
time, honey come here, look at this. Sigh, shamble over to see what else
she's found to spend money on. Whoda thought, she's found a little split
window bus that the top flips up on to reveal a small clock complete with a
clip so I can use it for a keychain or hang from something. Little dinky
thing maybe two inches long and blue over white. Maybe shoppings not all
bad.
