The '66 Westy is down the road.  Listee Michael Lewis is the new and proud
owner.
He ended upwith the Bus and I ended up with all of his stuff.  What stuff
you wonder??
His '66 daily driver Bug will now be my daily driver, and I have my newly
finished '69 daily driver up for sale.
There's more....I got his '63 cloth rag with lots of new goodies.  Motor,
trans, brakes, interior upholstery kit, new top fabric etc.
Still more...a '67 Hanover (Canadian camper conversion) for parts, a '71
Bus and a '79 Bus w/o motor...a type 4 tranny, some motors, and a load of
other VW parts too many to go into.
Stephen G.  if you read this I have your bumpers that have been over at
Michaels too.
Was given some interesting stuff from over on the Olympic Peninsula this
weekend too.  A bus gas heater, a bug gas heater, 2 type 4 trannies, a
couple of 40 horse motors, some early 40 horse carbs and manifolds
assorted 40 horse tin, and a middle seat (has a partial fold down at the
passengers side..salt and peppery thing) out of a deluxe.  And more.
The ragtop I will save for a total resto, the '71 I may sell whole, and
the '79 is going to get parted out as will the '67 Hanover bus.
I should have a bunch of stuff to haul down to Puyallup for the spring
opener swap late April!
I want to thank Scott Matson for getting me the NOS early '55 tail light
assembly and bulb holder at BBB last week!  (for a Bug, not a bus)
If anyone is in the market for a '69 Bug... let me know.  This is a nice
rust free CA Bug.  I know I know....you're all Bus nuts and what the hell
am I offering a Bug to you guys for right?  Good question.  I don't know.
later, I have to go make room for all this stuff!
