Hi Glynn,
While you are replacing the flexable fuel lines make sure that the grommet in
the forward engine tin is still in place around the metal fuel line, or use
there a slit section of fuel line hose clamped to metal line to prevent the
metal line getting sliced through over time.  We also reccomend using only
German fuel line with the cloth weave covering!
