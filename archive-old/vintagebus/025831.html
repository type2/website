Subject: Timing help
Message-ID: &lt;37FF37DA.7D4E4F1E_at_earthlink_dot_net&gt;

I got a call today form a girl who was in the throws of a timing
problem.  She's done all the normal stuff (valve adjust, idle adjust,
point gap adjust, etc.) and then set it statically.  She says one book
says 7.5 BTDC and another says 5 ATDC (BTW this is a 71 motor with dual
vacume).  She says it will run but won't idle.   She says the carb is
good.

I told her to look for vacume leaks very closely.  Anyone care to help
her out?  My limited knowledge ran out rather quickly.  I told her I
would post her e-mail to the list.  Here it is:

fragilethunder_at_att_dot_net

Her name is Dia.  BTW she has read all of the articles on timing in the
T2 library and found me on the AIRS listing.  Clara, a fellow air-cooled
sister needs your expertise.

She thanks you all.

Steve
