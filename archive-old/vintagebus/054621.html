Subject: Re: [VB] bus steps

now, now people, take a chill pill. i wasn't expecting these to be the
rarest parts in the world. i have seen them on busses, but only a few. i,
too, see way more other old empi stuff for sale at swaps, and again, i
don't really remember seeing a set of steps. i only wanted to see if these
were unusual, desireable, etc. i'm not trying to sell them. i'm not trying
to repop them in hopes of making millions (they are actually quite
complicated). i was just CURIOUS.
i guess it's like most parts--in some parts of the world stuff is less
common than in other places. i'll just enjoy them on my bus, and decide
what to do with the other 2 different sets of (non-empi) steps i have.

I guess you need to come to some So Cal shows, Pomona or something besides
up North. I usally see 1 or 2 EMPI oil pump/filter???, Empi bug rear seats
and assorted other EMPI goodies, but RARELY the steps! I guess I'll buy all
the EMPI sh#t down here and bring it up north to trade for steps.

&gt; Hi Ronnie and Jon,
&gt; Nope!  Just because we think it is the most commonly found original EMPI
part 
&gt; at the swaps does not mean we think it is the most commonly found VW part
in 
&gt; the world.  For one thing with the EMPI logo on it big and bold on it, it
is 
&gt; easy for even the novice VW owner to notice it.  Try finding say one of
the 
&gt; original EMPI oil filter/pumps with EMPI logo on it (Wish we had a dozen
more 
&gt; of those!) or the oil filter with the EMPI sticker on it or the
1964-65ish 
&gt; front bus anti-sway bar (We had one NOS unit.) or a type 3 EMPI seat or
the 
&gt; EMPI bug gauge set.  All of these are much harder to find than the EMPI 
&gt; steps.     Eric&amp;Barb
