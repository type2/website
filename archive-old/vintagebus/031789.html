If you want to fly and ride Pheonix is the best bet, just post to the list
and get a ride. If you want to fly and drive Las Vegas is the closet. We
also have an airport in Havasu, but flights are limited and there is also an
airport in Laughlin,Nevada.

Buses by the Bridge V
January 19,20 and 21, 2001 
Lake Havasu City, Az.
