Subject: RE: [VB] reaming swing lever bushings

I have a reamer that I loan for free with the purchase of the center pin
kit. You just have to pay the shipping back to me.

Subject: [VB] reaming swing lever bushings


I'm getting ready to replace the swing lever bushings
on my bus...wolfsburg west rents a reamer with their
kit, but it's reserved until late august! So i'm
thinking about getting my own adjustable reamer...but
I don't want to spend a lot...Does anybody know what
size I should look for, and where I might be able to
get one cheap? ebay doesn't look promising right
now...or better yet, anybody have a reamer they could
lend/rent/sell? I've got some goodies I could trade
for the use of a reamer (pop-out-latches, seat
brackets, gas guage, 14&quot; wheels, ash tray,
etc...)thanks,
-russ henry
