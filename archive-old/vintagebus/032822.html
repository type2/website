Hi Pete,
We run cable that we buy from our local Motorola shop from the engine to the
dash and it takes about 21'.  The cable we use has anywhere from 4 to 6
individually insulated and colored wires inside of a outside layer of
insulation.  Cost is about $1.00 per foot.  The only holes you have to drill
is in the forward engine compartment sheet metal and in the front nose above
the belly pan and install grommets.  Then run the cable, weave it into the
under carrage and just make sure that it is at least 2&quot; away from any moving
parts including exposed cables and linkages   Result is that we can run all of
the wires need for the gauges we want in one job.  Except cylinder head temp
gauge which has to use it's own wire with it's sender.
