Subject: Re: [VB] RE: [T2] VW Boat

&gt; no pics as of yet This is a boat that fits on your roof attached to the rain
&gt; gutter   it is a few hunderd miles away from me
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Have been offered a blue and white VW boat, fiberglass, fits on the roof
&gt;&gt; What are they worth ?
&gt; 
&gt; VW made boats? Or are you talking a high top like mine?

I think I saw this boat at BBB a couple of years ago.  Very cool!  Designed
to fit nicely upside down on the roof of a splittie.  It was a little crude,
but would be a must have accessory for the true split collector like you
Jerry!

Snap that thing up!

Tom Buese-if you have to ask how much they are worth, you can't afford it?
