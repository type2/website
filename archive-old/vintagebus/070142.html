&gt; The drivers side has a rectangular gap when assembled between the rearmost

&gt; correctly where it mates to the upper engine tin.

Hi Jason,
sounds like you have a rear engine tin from a later 1970s type 1 and the tin 
in front of the pulley from a 1963ish through very early 1970s tin.

&lt;&lt; This is a pretty vauge description &amp;I'll get some pics up to help show 
what I am &gt; asking. If anyone has any good pics of the tinware needed to put a 
&gt; DP engine in a 66 it would help. Or if this problem sound like something 
&gt; that would happen w/ a part from car &quot;a&quot; which won't work as well as a part 
&gt; from bus &quot;b&quot; let me know.

Definitely the latter and the only solution is to find pieces of tin that not 
only fit together but fit the 1500-1600cc engine.
Happy hunting!
Eric&amp;Barb
