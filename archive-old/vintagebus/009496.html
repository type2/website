Hey all,

Here's the latest haps with our '66 Westy &quot;Clara&quot;.  Cannot help but reflect
that it's been a long while since my last update....but something's actually
happening!

If anyone has a Westy closet door handle that wants to be sold, please
contact me!  Also, I have a few pieces of that plastic trim from the
cabinets...I'm replacing it with oak, so if anyone needs some, contact me!

I need a water bottle and the rest of my water pump (the spout part).  Let
me know..

Gene
