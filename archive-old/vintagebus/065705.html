Subject: Re: [VB] OCTO

Had a great time at OCTO too. SV2s left SD at a little after 7. A clogged
fuel filter slowed us down a bit, but we finally got into the show a little
after 8. Thanks to the OCTO guys for holding space for us!

I scored an exhaust tip from Mr. Blue Box Parts himself Jeff. A lot of
people were drooling through his stuff and (I hope) a lot were buying. Got
the Official The Samba t-shirt from Everett, I recommend EVERYONE go and
buy one off of the site, Jenepher will thank you. Chatted with Matt &amp; Katie
and found out that they're moving closer to civilization, and will now be
able to hang out and go on camping trips! B.S.'d with the usual suspects
the rest of the day. I don't think I even made one complete circuit.

Oh yeah, and I got an NOS set of Type 34 foglight lenses. SWEET. But,
that's a topic for another list.

Glad to hear you avoided the tires, Jon!

See you all at the next one...
