 &gt;Good info for those who want to know what heck a &quot;single strap&quot; air cleaner
 is, too.  It's a 54-55 Barndoor Bus and Oval Window Bug thing.
 &gt;
 Well, '53 too but technically the '53 one is slightly different.

I though they came with the T for the 25hp motors, which is for 53.   except 
for having the optional heavy duty air cleaner, meaning oil bath- strap top, 
which my 53 has.  should check for indent.
