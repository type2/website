&gt; Is it true that one should not use selants or teflon tape on the threads of

&gt; incorrectly?  (The cause being that the selant or tape will keep the sender
&gt; from grounding properly). If this is true, what can you use to keep the
&gt; little buggers from slowly leaking oil?
Hi Richard,
I use green loctite on the pipe fitting for the pressure outlet. (RC609)
I figure that the threads contact at certain points and it always seems to
work.  Have to seal it up somehow.
