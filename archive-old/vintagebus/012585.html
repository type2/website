To the friendly and knowledgable list members:

I aplogise in advance if this is found in the archives. As of yet our
zero er hero is not on the web. Maybe next week, Lord willing.

The brake master cylinder reservoir on my '61 Kombi leaks around the JB
weld fix on the bottom. The new part is plastic with with a threded
fitting on the bottom is there any way to adapt this part?

Aloha

Ken
