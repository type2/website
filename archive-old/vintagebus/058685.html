Subject: slider latch




Hey guys

   Today i was shutting my window and i broke my slider latch. Man i hate
it when i break something on my bus. I went to my parts stash to only find a
slider latch for the passengers window. I need one for the drivers side.
They are not interchangable.  I was hoping some nice soul out there might
want to trade me for mine or maybe sell yours.
thanks
john.
