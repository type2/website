VeeWee wins again!

Got back into town about 6:30 tonight.  Changed clothes, pulled the
motor, pulled the clutch plate, and the disk wouldn't move.  Got my
alignment tool in there and twisted with everything I had; finally the
thing came out, gooey.  I DO have a main seal leak, but need the bus NOW
and happen to have an extra clutch disk.  Tossed it in, replaced the rear
tranny mounts while all was out, cleaned up the bell housing, and put the
shebang back together.  Test drive at 9:30.  Yahoo!  All is well, for
now, of course.  I'm stoked on a Sunday night I replaced the clutch in 3
hours.  Thanks for the help, all.  I could use the search engine thanks
to whatever problem about denied access that's plaguing it, so you all
came through.  I love this list!
