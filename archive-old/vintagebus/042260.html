&gt; Since the professional -BROKEN- one on ebay just went for $400+ (NOT

&gt; hard, but what about the vacuum ones? Clearly, just hooking up a vacuum

Well, they make hand-operated vacuum testers that would do the trick.
You pump the hand-held gadget and read the vacuum on a guage.

The big trick would be to rotate the distributor shaft at a constant, but
variable, RPM and be able to read that RPM accurately.  I could probably
do it with some equipment from my lab (motor drive, digital strobe light,
variable power supply), but I kind of doubt that Joe VW will have these
things laying around.
