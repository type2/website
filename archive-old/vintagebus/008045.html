Subject: Re: [VB] Deluxe Poptop Westy?

According to my Westy parts book the clamshell light went up to Werke #
1049. Since this is a B42 Parts book this would be the start of the '65
B42's.

Michael Heron's '65 Westfalia is Werke # 7 and is the earliest B42 in the
Westfalia Registry. He has the clam shell lights and the vehicle is all
original.......... I have had a ride in it and seen the lights as well!

&gt; A 67 I parted had a totally different base then the 66 I parted. I think
&gt; they used the dome light base from 1962 to mid 1966, then went to a all in
&gt; one unit.
&gt; Clamshell lens were used up till late 64 when they went to the rectangle
&gt; lens, then the all in one unit in late 1966. I'll have to go look at the
&gt; 65/66? westy VW Howard just picked up to see whats in it.

&gt; hm- my 65 westy, and a couple 66s and a 67 I had all had the dome light
base
&gt;
&gt; with rectangular cover.  Have not really scoped out a 64 so 42.  Guess
that
&gt; was changed early 65ish then.  Funny how they change things at random
&gt; intervals.  Curious about the date of your westy parts list, JP.

&gt; &gt; early so-42's (such as mine) came with clamshell's they then changed to
&gt; the
&gt; &gt; rectangular (and less attractive imho :) lights after that

&gt; &gt;  &gt; I thought clam shells were earlier than the so 42
&gt; &gt;  &gt; kit.  That so 42s and so 44s
&gt; &gt;  &gt; had the rectangular light covers, that in cross
&gt; &gt;  &gt; section are a U
&gt; &gt;  &gt;
&gt; &gt;  In the Westy parts catalog I have for SO-42's, the
&gt; &gt;  picture shows clamshells.  When (or if) my web site
&gt; &gt;  gets back up, I'll give you the url for that page.
