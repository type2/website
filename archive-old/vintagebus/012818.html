&gt;Southern Ontario&gt; Hello, well heres my problem, i found this old Tachometer
&gt;in my shed,
&gt; &gt;easily from the 70's. my dad told me it didn't work on his 72 nova, so i
&gt;know it's not a v-8 tach, it has 5 wires insted of 4?? it has a black,
&gt;connected to -ve battery.
red connected to +ve battery.
green connected to -ve coil, the same side as the points
white connected to power for illumination
and a yellow???? i had all but the yellow hooked up to where they are
supposed to be, and the tach will show idle perfect, but when i
&gt; &gt;rev the engine up or drive it, the tach will not go above 2k rpm??? i
&gt; &gt;dunno
&gt; &gt;whats wrong, or if i need to hook up the yellow wire?
&gt; &gt;any help or ideas would be appreciated greatly&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;e-mail me _at_ lordgemma_at_yahoo_dot_com&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;thanks&gt; &gt;      Ryan
