Steve, I love it!!

&gt; d) shoe polish VWOA sucks all over your award winning classic (on the
&gt; windows if you are worried about the paint) Might even be fun to put it on
&gt; there AFTER you win the #1 prize for best use of original VW lint.
&gt; e) make sure the press are around when the whole lot of you gets the boot!
-----------------------
The Following is correct:

&gt; From my perspective you have it backward. I think that they should have a
&gt; liscensing agreement for logo/TM usage for clubs and websites etc. More of
&gt; a symbolic thing but it would protect their trademark in that case. In the
&gt; case of repro parts no-one has the right to manufacture items with their
&gt; trademarks and logos which could be represented as OEM parts. What is the
&gt; purpose in making a repro part and putting a vw logo on there instead of
&gt; your own? Obviously to exploit the VW trademark or pass it off as VW. In
&gt; the third case of VW logo'd merchandise ie tshirts etc thats a bit more
&gt; complicated.
-----------------
About the Split Window thing... what did VW do when Ford, Renault, and several others OBVIOUSLY
directly copied the split window &quot;trademark,&quot; and SIMULTANEOUSLY manufactured them with VWs?
I DO NOT MEAN TO INSULT ANYONE!!!! ,but, that boat don't float!

-----------------
And finally, aside from ALL we have said, think of it this way... what if Chevrolet, Dodge, or
Ford tried to do the same thing?  Just think about it.  Think of the IMMENSE numbers of
individuals who would be fighting the Corporation!!!!!  It would make the VWoA issue look like a
worthless cause.  But then again, maybe that's what it'll take to prove just that... that it IS a
WORTHLESS CAUSE.  They don't make any money off of us by doing this.  Matter of fact, they have
literally NOTHING to gain. They never have - they never will!  Any of you who are business minded
will understand precisely what I'm saying.  It simply doesn't make good business since to cut off
your own feet and legs - the very foundation of what the company NOW(again) claims to stand on!!! 
(they forgot all about their feet and legs for 20 years or more)

We have only the lawyers to thank for the miraculous efforts they have taken past the breaking
point.  VWoA has cut people for copyright infringement, and trademark restrictions for 46 years. 
Only now, with the overwhelming increase in illegal circulation (aka: internet) have they really
taken things out of hand.  I personally feel the problem is that VWoA needs to re-examine the
processes they allow their lawyers to maintain.  VWoA's obvious reluctance to acknowledge repeated
calls, mails, emails, and letters only shows that they feel guilty!!  Any student of psychology
101 can tell you that!

FOR VWoA!!:   (since your watching)    Grow UP, and publicly apologize for your nuissance on
American Society!  It is pitiful to watch!!  You can write me directly, (which IS seen as a legal
form of communication) when you wish to apologize. GoodOleVolk_at_yahoo_dot_com ...and I dare you to
bring that to court!  The letter &quot;W,&quot; following a &quot;U&quot; is NOT a registered mark of the Volkswagen
Corporation!  It is only a term used to describe the company whose cars we are fond of.  It is
based from the registered mark of the Blue Colored V over W symbol, in a perfectly round circle,
which IS a registered mark of VWoA.  According to the terminology you use, the fact that every
time anyone in the US (similar to VW, heh??) prints the Alphabet online, they will be supposedly
commiting a crime???  Yeah... right!!!  You certainly can't prove in court that a website that is
supporting the Volkswagen automobile was printed in &quot;Bad Faith,&quot; either!  According to YOUR
Lawyer's definition of the Anticybersquatting Consumer Protection Act, that is what you would have
to prove!
