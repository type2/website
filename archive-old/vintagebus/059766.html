Subject: Nikki &amp; Steve, Headed for HCBF

Nikki and Steve picked up Nikki's bay with the new nose skin and left here
around 1 pm headed to Boone Nc and the HCBF , via 311 to Winston, then 421
on to Boone. I may steal Shirls Yota and drive up tomorrow and spend the day
but i'm not camping this time, I just have too much crap going on at the
time to be gone all weekend. It was a joy seeing Nikki's face when she saw
the nose on her bus. Makes all the wrestling and stuff worth it even more.
