&lt;&lt;neutral, let clutch pedal out, sound goes away. Push it in and it's back.
Just
&gt; had the trans and clutch replaced so I'm certain it's related.  Maybe the
&gt; clutch plate is still making contact?  What do you think?


&gt;&gt;First of all, you are not holding the clutch in during lights are you?
You must not ''ride' the clutch during stop lights. You hav probably
worn out your throwout bearing as a result of riding the clutch. That's
the sound yo are hearing when you engage the clutch now. &gt;&gt;

Yes I do hold the clutch pedal down (all the way) during a red light, but I
don't consider that &quot;riding&quot; the clutch.  Isnt &quot;riding&quot; when one keeps varying
pressure on the pedal to regulate thier acceleration, say creaping in traffic,
or to hold themselves on a hill? 

I don't understand how anything could be damaged by holding a depressed pedal
for the 30 seconds a light is red, anymore than the double amount of pedal
work necessary by depressing the pedal, shifting to neutral, depressing the
pedal again, shifting to first, releasing pedal at green light.  Am I the only
one that keeps the car in first, and holds the pedal down?

Oh, I forgot to mention that I replaced the trans and clutch/T.O. bearing only
25
miles ago, so I doubt I've worn anything out through any bad driving habits
yet.

Thanks
