Hello,

Since its friday... I have always wondered... In almost all US states
vehicles manufactured before 1968 do not need to have seatbelts, heck
anything 61 and older doesnt even have mounting bosses for them.

Now, with how seat belt crazy everyone is as of late... could the tester
refuse to test you in your legally registered vehicle because of the
absence of seatbelts, even though they arent legally required? (this could
be especially problematic if said vehicle were the only one at your
disposal...)

things that make you go hmm (on friday)

Steve
