Subject: Re: [VB] Indecent Proposal

I think that one of the reasons this list has slowed down is because on the Samba folks are able to ask a question and have it answered fairly quickly. A lot of posts on here tend to shift topics by the 2nd or 3rd reply. 
Listing your Ebay auction on here would be good for sellers as you could expand your viewing audience, but as a buyer you would have more competition. Why not just post a link to all of your auctions next to your name/signature? That way there wouldn't be a bunch of threads for a hubcap or clutch cable! 
There is a lot of stuff on ebay and searching can be a little time consuming but if you want something bad enough that is what you have to do. It's no different than going through greasy piles of parts at a swap weet.
