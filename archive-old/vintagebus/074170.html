Subject: Re: [VB] San Jose FLAPS? 12V starter motor needed!

I 'd buy one at a schucks/kragen's /checkers.  cheap, have a lifetime guarantee, stores everywhere in the country, keep you receipt. 

Oh, this happened in my bug once.    You may think about pulling the motor and seeing how chewed up the FW teeth are, maybe replace FW.  ya, check yr FW.

&gt; My starter/solenoid decided to fail in an interesting manner: the solenoid
&gt; is failed in the start position, and somehow entered that position *while*
&gt; I was driving home last night! So I need a new starter and 
&gt; solenoid. I'm
&gt; in Cupertino/West San Jose area. Any good VWFLAPS?
