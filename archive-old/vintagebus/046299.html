Subject: Re: [VB] Taillight Change in 57?
To: Vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

Ok i think i've got it...

The change occurred on 05 April, 1957 at ch # 246-964
Now it seems that I indeed have an April 57 15 window.  Ch# 254-867
So I guess I have an extra brakelight assembly and '57 bubble taillights.
Too bad I just missed the deadline.  I could always keep the lights and CLAIM 
its an early 57 ;) just kidding.  Would be cool if the bus was born on 4/20 
though because thats also my birthday, but about 23 years before me ;)
