Subject: looking for a stripper in the SF Bay area.

What?

Wait, this isn't some sick SPAM.

i'm looking for a good cheap place to get some metal pices stripped of paint
and crap.

In the Bay Area (including Santa Cruz and vicinity, maybe even Sac)


I got some wheels and frames I want to prep for paint.

I'm hoping to find an inexpensive place that I can drop off my pieces, have
them 'dip' it into whatever and have it come back to me ready for primer and
paint?

Any sugestions?
