Here's my technique:

Prepare part to be painted (ie wash, sand, etc)

Clean with laquer thinner to remove any oils or residue

Lay on a mist coat of paint, let dry 10-15 minutes

Lay on 2 or 3 more coats to effect good coverage, with about 10
minutes between them.

After the last coat has dried ~ 10-15 minutes, put it in the
oven ~150-200 degrees, no preheat.  If you let it dry too long before baking,
the solvents underneath will wrinkle the top coat.  If you
do it too soon, it will burn.

By not preheating, you let the part come up to temp gradually.  I bake
the item for 30-45 minutes, then shut off the heat, and let it cool
slowly with the residual heat of the oven.  If you don't need
the oven for dinner that afternoon, let it sit all night.

Old gas ovens are great for this, as the heat from the pilot light
will keep the item slightly warm, and enhance the process.

The baking does several a couple things for you: it activates the solvents
in the paint, causing it to &quot;flow out&quot; better, giving an unbelieveable
shine.  Once the solvents are gone, it toughens the finish, making
it more resistant to chipping.

Do not get impatient and try to handle the item before it's cool; you'll
only screw it up - trust me!

Also, this will stink up the kitchen like you won't believe.  Open a
couple windows and turn on the ventilating fanbefore you start.

&gt; don't be surprised if the solvent catches fire or even explodes!

&gt; I let parts air-dry, and then give them a bake in the oven.  Seems to make
&gt; the paint a lot more durable.
