I won't!  I would not want to inflict so much harm upon my bus!  My
considerings were done thinking that it was a possibility if the real estate
was the same, but since it isn't, I can now think of other
things.....thanks!

&gt; &gt; &gt; Question:  Will this fit?

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; No. Different hinges, different width of hatch. You would have to
&gt; &gt; replace the whole rear body section with the corners.
&gt; &gt; Please dont.
