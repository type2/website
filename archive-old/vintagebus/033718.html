  I just received 4 more sets of CE Safaris from England, I have 3 primmered
and 1 chrome set. I am going through my list of orders and I have 1 chrome
set and 1 primered set left.  I also have a complete set of deluxe molding
from them also.  I will have another shipment from England soon with more
aluminum pop-out frames, Safaris, 1 set of BD Safaris, and a few of there
short and long Westy racks.  If there is something they make and you want it
let me know as I can have it shipped in my next order.

thank you
