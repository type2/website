 My '67 Double door has an original cab divider with all the original 
 attachment point on the roof - not a retrofit.  Might the cab divider itself 
 or the cab divider in a double door combination be M-code 426?  Any other 
 double doors out there who can verify?
  &gt;&gt;
if your double door panel is a bench seat model, it would have come new with 
a cab divider installed.  This was not an optional extra, but standard 
equipment with bench seat panels.  I believe 426 is a code meaning N American 
specs.
