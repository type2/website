two,
i have sent this a few times before i knew how to successfully post.
while on a trip through central america in my 64' micro i witnessed a few 
bay window busses that had the earlier sguare windows down the side, narrow 
rear hatch and CORNER WINDOWS these bay window had the tall taillights(72+), 
roll up windows on the front doors and the early style intake vents(pressed 
in). they seemed very new so i am wondering if there might be a supplier of 
new OEM corner glass south of the border for all you out there lucky enough 
to be driving deluxes.
sighting #2
many years ago before i even owned my first van, i saw an episode of the 
twilight zone called &quot;coyote moon&quot; in this old black and white show the main 
character drove a very early westy, with a strange camper layout. if you get 
a chance to view it, notice the lack of sliding and vent windows, removed 
undoubtedly to accomodate the camera shots of passengers etc.

note. i would never want to profit from shipping and handling charges from 
something i sold on e-bay.(having a bad time with someone over charging me 
by pennies). shouldnt the profit be made from the product, and if the 
shipping is payed by me, the purchaser, do i also have to pay $0.80 for the 
seller to travel to the post office?
i ship things quite often and would consider it an unethical thing for me to 
do.
sorry for the opinionation(is that a word)
