&gt;As used in this section a slow-moving vehicle is one which is proceeding at
&gt;a rate of speed less than the normal flow of traffic at the particular &gt;time

On the other hand, the 85mph that the other cars want to go,
is NOT the &quot;normal&quot; flow of traffic.  The normal flow of traffic
according to LEO's is between the minimum and maximum posted
speeds, usually 45mph-70mph on the interstate, 45-55 through cities.
