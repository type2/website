Subject: [VB] email/ king pin

well i spent some time searching the email archives this weekend , its a
little difficult because i cant find answers to questions that were posted ,
you can find messages on certain topics but the replies arent there, does
any one have any suggestions on this?

the main thing im trying to figure out is if there is an alternative to
paying $250 for a rebuilt spindle, like buying a new KING PIN KIT, and who
has them, and if the oversized bushing with your old king pin is a good
thing, i would appreciate a little advice here, please
