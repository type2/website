I forgot to mention that I found a couple school buses.  Walking inside
these converted campers was neat - lots of neat ideas but at the same time a
shame that someone's work is sitting in a heap like this.  One bus had an
old white beetle seat (lowback) sitting in it and the other one had an old
never opened set of VW pedal pads (with the V logo - not VW) so I grabbed
them as well.

On the way out, I spied an old car with a split window and banjo steering
wheel however, it was a not VW.  Look how close the similarities are though.
You could take an old wheel like this and make an adaptor and fool a lot of
people that aren't in the know. :-)

Okay, now for the URL:  http://home.ispi_dot_net/~elassley.bie/nqjy/index.htm

They aren't organized but enjoy anyway.  When I go back, I can get parts if
you need them - just send me a list and how much you are willing to pay so I
know what kind of dickering room I have.
