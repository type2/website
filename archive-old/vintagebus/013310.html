&gt; I am considering rebuilding my 30 PICT-1, which is original to my
bus.  It is
&gt; currently in a box (my wrench told me this carb was &quot;shot&quot;, and put
in another
&gt; one that won't idle at all), but seemed to work fine when the bus
last ran.  I
&gt; want to stay original if possible.  I just completed a check of the
Archives
&gt; and found some good info, but would like some current views:
&gt; 
&gt; Should I bother?

Yes.  IMO, this was the best of the solex carbs.

&gt; Can anyone recommend the right re-build kit and source?

Is the throttle shaft loose?  If so, send the carb body off to RIMCO
for bushings. It'll run you about $30.  Rebuild kits are available at
just about any VW FLAPS.

&gt; What problems should I anticipate?

Very few.  Just take the thing apart, clean it up with spray carb
cleaner (wear safety goggles!), get it rebushed, reasssemble.  This is
the easiest carb I've found.

You should check the float level.  Get a small funnel (I made one out
of an old fuel filter), a short length of fuel line and a quart of
gasoline.  Support the carb in a level position.  Attach the fuel line
to the inlet barb and fill 'er up with gas until the valve closes. 
Carefully remove the carb top and measure the fuel level (measure down
&gt;from the gasket surface to the fuel).  If the level is too high, then
you need a thicker washer under the needle valve.  Too low needs a
thinner washer.  There are usually several washers packed with a
rebuild kit.

&gt; How do I get all the grunge and accumulated crud off?

Spray carb cleaner.  Magic stuff.  Nasty too.  Try to keep it off of
your skin and always wear eye protection.  It hurts like fury when it
gets in your eyes!  Squirt it through all the passages of the carb,
wait for a few minutes, then squirt again.

Have fun!
