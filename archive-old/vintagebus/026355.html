&gt; &gt;Can any body help me ? Iam looking for a nice rear crank apron for my 1959

&gt; Of course you know a crank apron isn't &quot;correct&quot; for your bus, and aquiring
&gt; one will one will only beget the desire for a crank, pulley nut, and
&gt; window'd rear tin...
&gt; 

You know, I have heard several people call the rear apron a &quot;crank
apron&quot; because it goes up to the crank pulley... not even thinking about
the one that allowed a crank-start....maybe Glen is lookimg for the
correct apron?
