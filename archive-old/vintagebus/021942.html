Hey guys,
    Just picked up a 1961 Camper and I'm trying to find out what it is.  
Looks similar in setup to a '66 Sundial I used to have, but it has a z-bed in 
the back and I'm told that Sundials didn't come with this setup on a Bus this 
early.  Any ideas or sources of info to compare interiors?  Any help would be 
appreciated.
