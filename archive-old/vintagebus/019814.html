The engine is in, the wheels are all on, the tranny goes into the gears, it
_runs_ :-)...I'm down to just a few issues.

I thought I'd see if the original master cylinder (dual circuit) worked.  It
seemed to, but I think it leaks.  I'll know better in the morning.  I tried
to bleed the rear brakes.  Now, the system was partially dry when I started,
and I also replaced all the rubber lines and wheel cylinders, so there wasn't
much fluid to start.  But I went through about four bottles of fluid and STILL
had bubbles coming out of the line.  I've never really done a lot of brake work
before (always needed little if any bleeding) so I don't know if this is
normal.  Is it?  Anything else I should be paying attention to?  FYI, I'm still
on the first wheel (pass. rear) and still air comes.

The spring plate leaks at the RGBs I mentioned are partially solved.  It _is_
the freeze plugs that are leaking, at least on the driver's side.  I was able
to stop the leak on the driver's side but somehow made the leak on the pass.
side worse.  I'll try redoing the cleaning/sealing in the morning.

So I've run the engine, but the bus has yet to move under its own power :-P
BTW, I am very impressed with the couple-year-old Die-Hard battery I'm using.
It sat without being charged for months, while being used for fixing/testing
the electrical, and for interior light for working at night.  And it cranked
the engine up this afternoon on its own!
