Pretty sure you're right. Seen a few picture in VolksWorld of 67 dcab
owned by crazed German. No airboxes and stonking 2.4 litre waterboxer
converted to aircooled. Looked at Everett Barnes's site - saw a lot of
American dcabs with nary an airbox betwixt them. BTW the same VolksWorld
issue featured a beetle built by another German more crazed than the
first. His car has 924 brakes, 911 gearbox and 2 litre type4 with hand
made Porsche style shroud and two Fiat Uno turbos(one per bank). This
thing looks pretty close to stock from the outside and makes in the
region of 400 horse power. It is completely road legal and he uses it to
blow off hyper expensive supercars.
