Well, you didn't mention anything in the description other then that there
is a 1600 DP not installed condition unknown. Could be spare. It's a 50/50
to me. You said clearly to e-mail you in case of any questions. I would sure
ask questions if I'm about to pay $2k for something, anything.

&gt; I have a question for everyone.  Last week I had my bus on ebay that
&gt; sucessfully reached the reserve and the high bidder said that I
&gt; misrepresented my ad
&gt;
&gt;     my question for everyone is this.  After reading the ad  would you
&gt; assume that the bus is running?
