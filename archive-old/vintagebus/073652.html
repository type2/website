Subject: The question of quality.  Was: Rubber seal too long

Since this brings up the question of quality from the major suppliers
(at least rubber products), I'd like to throw in a plug and a big THANK
YOU to Ronnie.  I saw the molded corner seals he is selling, and they
make the WCM/Wolfsburg/what ever else look like home depot weather
stripping.  

These could easily pass for NOS.  They are EXACT as far as I could see. 
The correct rib on the outside face, the correct 3 ribs on the inside of
the glass channel and pinch weld channel and the molded corners make
this seal just like the original.  In fact, they are so close, I'd be
suspect of anyone selling &quot;NOS&quot; ones in the near future.  At Sunday's
Pomona, Mo Moore of Cycle Garden SC fame took one look at them and
plunked down the $70 bucks no questions asked.  If you've seen the truck
or his bikes, you know he is a stickler.

Now all we need to do is have people donate OG NOS seals of different
types, and maybe Ronnie will put them in the pipeline.  I've offered up
my one and only NOS safari window seal so maybe those will be along
someday.  I'll let Ronnie respond since I don't want to speak for him.
