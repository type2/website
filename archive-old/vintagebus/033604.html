Subject: Colo/new engine

   Well just about ready for the journey, all I need to do is LOAD the bus
(ha ha). The new 1800 type 1 engine seems to be running good, I have 60
miles on it so it's ready for a road trip. Went on a uphill in the heat
drive to see how it pulls and did much better when I bumped the timing up a
little. Rejetting helped the top end, no more stumble at 5000 rpm, the worse
part is my Tach took a dump, so will be driving by ear. Did the dipstick
test after driving approx. 50 miles _at_ 70/75 MPH up and down long grades and
could still pull the dipstick so must be running cool enough (type 3 tight
finned oil cooler), no oil light flicker at idle so it's ready to go. Going
to check the RGB's and the front bearings, slap a little lithium lube on the
Berg shifter, blow the dirt out of the cab and off I go. I don't know if
I'll be driving solo or with a couple others as they want to leave _at_ 4am.
and I don't think I'll be ready then. It's doesn't matter as we'll all hook
up in NM.
