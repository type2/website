   Was flicking last night on the tube when I came across a show on
Speedvision called Car Crazy, it had a story on Chrysler's chief designer,
then went to a story about VW's and the CLASSIC. They showed a few buses
included the lowered 21 (yellow) deluxe with the hydraulics scrapping the
ground, a few other buses and had a long (for TV) conversation with a lady
and her pop-top westy and of course showed a lot of other VW related cars,
an interview of the PO of Simple shoes (a very wealthy person after he sold
the shoe brand).
