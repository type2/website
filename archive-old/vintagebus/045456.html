&lt;&lt; That's what I thought, but when I charged the battery and fixed the wires

 put in new brushes (three days later) the regulator worked great. Had no 
problems with the system at all. The only thing I could think of is maybe the 
key was on while I was trying to charge it?  &gt;&gt;
Hi Steve,
One of the regulator functions is to cut off voltage when the engine is off 
from the battery going back to the generator which would turn the generator 
into an electrical motor and draining off the battery and probably destroying 
the generator.  So unless you have some bad wiring that somehow short 
circuiting past the regulator to the generator, most likely the points in 
your regulator stuck shut and allowed voltage from the charger past the 
regulator.  Which is why it is always best to keep a eye on the 
regulator/generator idiot light when shuting down the engine to make sure it 
goes out.  If it stays on dissconnect the battery and replace the regulator.
