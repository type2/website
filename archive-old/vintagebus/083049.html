Subject: Re: [VB] I need some valuable input...?

I believe the correct terminology is to &quot;dispute the charge&quot; and it can work 
wonders. Most credit card companies will work with you. I have had good 
experiences with mine a couple of times when I was not satisfied. Call right 
away as your rights with the credit card company are time limited.

&gt; problem, honestly - but the rest sounds like build issues. if you paid by 
&gt; credit card, contest the charge!  often that will get results if nothing 
&gt; else.
