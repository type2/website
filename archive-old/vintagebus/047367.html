 this is quote from a post &quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;My favorite part is the typos...If a person 
can't take the effort to spell
&quot;purist&quot; correctly, can they really be trusted to restore a vehicle?&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot; 

I have no idea what this is about but i take a bit of offence to the spelling 
thing ,,nothing serious ,but my spelling ,grammer,suck but does that make my 
metalworking any less quality,? I think not,i weld for a living and restore 
Vw's ,thats what makes my reputation,and puts groceries(sp) on my table. I 
take pride in my work not my typing skills, If i took this wrong i am sorry, 
if i took it rite thats my .02 worth.later
