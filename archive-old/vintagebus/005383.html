Hi y'all,

I went into the &quot;best&quot; paint store in town and asked them if the paint codes
for Pearl White L87 and Sea Blue L360 meant anything to them.  They told me
that DuPont had a formula to match the Sea Blue( 8043), which
cross-referenced to Nason brand paints, which is what I'll probably be
using.  However, they said that the Pearl White (8027) was &quot;not available&quot;.
How can this be?

I searched the archives and came up with the best plan of action:  I'll take
the Pearl White blockoff plate from my '67 to them for color matching....and
I'd like to give them something besides a photo for the Sea Blue as well.
Does anyone have a small chunk of Volkswagen with un-oxidized Sea Blue on it
that I could borrow/buy, whatever?  We're not positive that we're going to
go with that color yet, so there is no hurry, but I'd like to have all my
soldiers in a row before plunging into the fray.....

Thanks,

Gene
