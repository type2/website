Subject: List Funding - An Idea

I've suggested this before and nobody was interested - because I think it is
such a great idea I'm a gonna suggest it again.  How bout if someone made,
say, baseball caps, say, in vintage bus colours or colour combinations and
there was an AIRS emblem on the front.  What would it cost to make such a
cap - $10.00?  It could sell for, say, $15.00 and the extra $5.00 could go
to the list. Who wouldn't want a nice Mango Green cap with an AIRS logo on
it - damn, I'd take 2.   It would be a little tough for someone like me to
do this - being in central Canada - but, maybe I could check into it if
there is an interest.

1/2 hour before Friday -  easy big boy.
