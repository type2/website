Subject: Re: [VB] Rubberized Coatings - an Interior Rust Preventative?

Hi Terry,
Thanks, but we will stick with a chemical that repels rust!  Just because 
something is old does not mean it has since been surpassed.  That and our VWs 
from the last millennium.  We have seen the rusty evil of rubberized bedliners.
