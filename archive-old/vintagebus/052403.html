Rich,

I have a 56 bus with the original tranny (split case crash box).  The bus has 
a 1600 SP.  It goes like hell up to 50 when I feel like I should be putting 
it into 5th gear (probably around 3,000 rpm).  Around town etc, I run it 
here.  On trips/highways I run it at 55 mph and I would guess my rpm to be 
around 3,500 rpm.  I have run it up to 60 mph, but won't hold it there.  My 
bus is a sunny weekend driver, so this is OK for me and I never had as much 
fun driving slow.  I change my oil every 1,000 miles and adjust the valves 
also, and hope for the best.  My tranny is making bearing noise and 
occasionally pops out of gear.  After 46 years, its time has come. I am 
contemplating a freeway flier, or a taller ring and pinion.  I would like to 
be able to do 65 mph without destroying my engine.  Any faster, and I 
wouldn't be able to stop the old bus.  Hope this helps.

Jim Cahill
56 Kombi
