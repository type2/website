before you go to this trouble to make an index. 
-  look for the contents page in the front of your book- it lists the main 
sections.
-  in each main section at the front is a contents page, which lists the sub 
sections in that section.

at least in my original there is.
= = = = = == = = = = = = 
Is there an electronic copy of the Type 2 Bentley around ?  If so how about 
running some indexing SW against it as a first pass?  I have seen some 
software that you can build a taxonomy for searching with.

Thom... you seen this stuff?
