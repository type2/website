&lt;&lt;   Anyhow, they were

 &gt; model year, definately the 67 has a differnt kind
 &gt; than 65.
 
 Really? I have a 67, does that mean I have yet ANOTHER
 67-only part to hunt for?
 
 I need the washer bottle, is 67 unique? How can I tell
 if I come across one? And can the others be adapted,
 if I dare.

Th washer bottle is the same (64 or) 65 through 67, and is much the easiest 
to find as they were standard then.  63 (64?) it was available as an option, 
and the bottle is slightly differnt, and much rarer.   yea they are 
interchangable, but the caps to the earlier bottle do not fit the later and 
vice versa.


I am sorry if my previous post was a bit confusing, for some reason i thought 
it was a 63, not a 66 that the original question was about, oops.  Dyslexics 
of the world Untie!
