Subject: Re: [VB] Re: tent

I've got a '67 B42 as well but no sign of any aluminum runners for the tent
it is supposed to have ( stripped paint to bare metal before repaint). It
did have the roof rack on it at one time as I can see the indents from the
legs left on the roof gutter.

Anyway what if you walked into the dealer back in  Jan '66 and wanted a
Westfalia without the tent ( an C42 Westfalia) and all the dealer had was a
B42 lying around the lot. I doubt he would let the sale go and probably kept
the tent...... So did the aluminum trim for the tent get installed by the
dealer before delivery?

Or another possibility for my B42 .......did I get the early '68 tent with
the floor...... By March of '67, the interior handles on the interior
Westfalia cabinets started with the '68 style going into the new model year.

I haven't found anybody able to answer this question yet....

&gt;
&gt; There is a aluminum &quot;runner&quot; afixed to the passengers
&gt; side drip rail that the stand alone tent attaches to.
