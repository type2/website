&gt; My son's 66 bus has two wires going into one of the plugs, I seem to only 
&gt; have one.  Could a wire have become disconnected from this push-on/in plug?

Hi Ed,
Best to remove your ground cable on your battery and then remove the 
headlight switch.  That way you can ID the connections on the switch by # and check 
the color of the wiring going to these connections to the wiring diagrams on 
Thom's vintagebus_dot_com website.
