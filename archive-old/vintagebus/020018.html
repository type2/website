  You need to get a sturdy crate built for it. He will 
need a couple pallets, Plywood, and cardboard boxes, 
nails, hammer and circular saw to do it himself. 
  Internal dividers would help to keep everthing inside 
in its place and strengthen it. Have him go to his local 
foam store and pick up some 4x8 styrofoam and other 
packing stuff he needs. We ship bulky fragile stuff like 
acrylic displays and fish tanks this way. We use 
Bestway, Roadway, CWX, etc.
  An easy, cheap way would be to find the friendly ear 
of a shipping/receiving supervisor, it will go a long 
way. My suggestion is to ask around until you find a 
friend of a friend that will help you (or your friend 
rather) out making the crate at the their shop after 
work...and take an 12 pack of macrobrew domestic beer, 
they seem to like that!
  
Hope this helps,

I've finally found the correct interior for my 64' 
sundial camper.  Problem
is...  I'm on the east coast, its on the west coast.  As 
these things go, I
can arrange for local delivery to a friend in san diego, 
but still need to
get it shipped out here.  Has anyone had experience with 
this.  I have no
clue where to start.  Are there companies who will show 
up and pick it up?
Will they pack it for a fee?

Any suggestions would be appreciated.
