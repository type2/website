Subject: Re: re; the great truck bumper mystery solved?

&gt;now that we know there were ribbed truck bumpers
&gt;vwhoward has 1 on his 58 BINZ, what years were they made, are there slash
and &gt;pointed truck bumpers, or only ribbed, kyle said there is a slash truck
bumper ( i have &gt;never seen one)and i have also never seen a pointed one, so
has the mystery really &gt;been solved or only part of it?

Not only have I seen it, I had my foot on it. I begged and pleaded but to no
avail. It is definitely a truck bumper. White, slash truck bumper. I damn
near had an organism. Or maybe it was gas. Anyway, the proud owner of this
relic was not in the slightest interested in letting it go. I hope that if
he changes his mind I'm the one he calls. (shameless plug, he's a listee) He
may be wanting me to do a little cabinetry one day for one of his busses and
I'll be leaping at the chance if we can work out the details. Now as to a
pointy, I've never seen one of those. Oddly enough, Jerry Jess' 1963
coachbuilt Frickinger hearse was originally constructed from a single cab
but it has a bus rear bumper. I looked at this detail for awhile once and it
has splash pans on it. They fit the pickup square rear corners snugly, yet
they also fit the round bus bumper. That one is a poser. If it wasn't VW
that made them, then Frickinger went to all the trouble to manufacture a
splash pan to fit a bus bumper, when the truck would have theoretically come
with a truck bumper. Very odd. I suppose they may have ordered a stripped
truck to build the hearse from, but still you would think they would have
ordered the correct bumper if it were available.
