Sometimes you run into problems insuring a camper because they think you are
living in it. One company wanted to take photos of my bus to make sure it
wasn't a live-in. Another wanted photos because my job was a carpenter and
they thought I might be using it as a work vehicle (being a van and all).

I've been with AAA insurance for a while now and I'm very pleased. No
hassles and good service. They had the best rates I could find (even better
than some of those little funky companies) + I like the fact that they are
big and well known. You've got to have a good driving record for them to
take you though. Don't know how they would deal with a &quot;show&quot; or &quot;vintage&quot;
vehicle.

&gt; I called up Hagerty today and they wouldn't insure my buses (my
&gt; 64) because ..
&gt; 1.  Its a camper.  I don't know why...it doesn't have electricity
&gt; or gas or
&gt; anything like that which they said they wouldn't insure.
