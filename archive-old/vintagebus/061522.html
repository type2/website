Subject: Re: [VB] Re: [VW] 009 versus what?

019's were common on busses as well. In the 60's bosch
had a &quot;Screamer Kit&quot; that consisted of a Blue coil and
a 019 that was painted metallic blue. I like it too,
but now i am running a 010. It works good on my bus
and it has a black cap! I know how vain...
