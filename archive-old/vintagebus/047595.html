Subject: Re: [VB] Break in oil, cool weather considerations?

the break in, what weight would be good for road break in, then storage for 
winter in the garage? &gt;&gt;

Hi AL,
VW of Germany according to Progressive Refinments used 10 WT for the cooler 
weather months and 20 WT for the warmer months for the first oil fillup year 
after year.  We have been wondering about trying to see what the average 
weather condtions at Wolfburg during these times of year were and come up 
with an accurate idea of what outside temps they used these two wieghts of 
initial break in oil.  For now our best guess is when the weather is going to 
be most likely below 50F 10 WT was used.  Above 50F 20WT was used.  After the 
VWs were delievered to the dealer the oil was changed to which ever wieght 
for the local climate conditions.   Eric&amp;Barb
