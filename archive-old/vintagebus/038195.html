Hi TJ,
Unless those are some really heavy duty tires with at least a load rating of 
1500 Lbs. each (The higher the better!), you would do better to try out the 
wrecking yards and used tire dealers in your area for ones that fit your 14 
inch bus rims.  As far as how hard it is to find 15&quot; bus rims it depends on 
what part of the world you are on!  

&lt;&lt;Can I get 4 lug drums that fit the bus and take beetle rims?&gt;&gt;
Only by having a reputible machine shop drill a four lug pattern in your 
drums or by using those cheesy adapter plates that often cause premature 
bearing failure!
