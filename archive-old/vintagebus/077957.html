Subject: Re: [VB] Gathering my ammo

I actually dumped them.  Even though I had a 6 month warranty on my rebuilt
engine - the case was cracked - they &quot;rebuilt it&quot; again and it still leaks
oil .. not a DRIP, but more like seeps oil .. Even so, rather than let them
touch it I have decided to take my chances in court .. F them.  Diane

&gt; Looks like the mechanics they just used you for as long as they wanted and
&gt; then disposed of you. Pity.
