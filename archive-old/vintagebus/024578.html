Subject: yellow light

Figured out what was making the yellow light come on. Boy, do I feel 
dumb!! When I was troubleshooting, I pulled the ignition switch out of 
the steering column and promptly lost (misplaced) the screw that holds it 
in. So the switch is lying on my package tray. It was simply shorting to 
the tray. Dooooooooooooh!
