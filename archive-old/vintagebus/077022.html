Subject: [VB] RE: adjusting steering box

&gt;&gt;That said, I have
known for years my steeringbox was the weak point in my steering, but have a
mental block about them, and put it off for about 5 years. over which time it
slowly got worse.   It really didn't get too bad until recently.&lt;&lt;

I just finished doing the center pivot bushing replacement ( thanks on those who helped ) and replaced the drag link. This summer I replaced the tie rod (ends).

Only play is in the steering box now, I cannot adjust it so there is no play unless I give it too much drag.  
Bentley manual suggests that if your steering wheel does not return to the center after a turn then you have too much drag.  
I did some tests, and this is a good indication.  I suspect many steering boxes ( like mine ) have gotten abused from the rest of the steering gear being outa shape.

I am reasonably happy about my steering now but alas I know the feeling, I probably need to replace the steering box too.
