Hahahahaa! and just to think that Paula kicked my a**
when dragged home the 1968 Buick Sportwagen 400 &lt;Vista
cruiser like&gt; stationwagon project!
Boy would my butt be dead if I trucked that one into
the neighborhood.
If it had deluxe windows up top it would be worth at
least $20k in today's market! ;-) I think I'll scream
the next time that I watch a rusted/aborted piece of
**** deluxe project sell and hear the seller tell me
This ebay gem kinda reminds me of the car that the
tweaker freak in my old neighborhood tried to paint
with rattle cans in the dead of winter. Night after
nightsubstituted the rattle can for the welder and
sawz-all.
I think I'll stick with the rides that I have for
sale... With my luck this extruded piece of &quot;work&quot;
will sell before any of mine.
