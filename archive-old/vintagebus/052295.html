Subject: Re: [VB] What ever happened to the five hundred dollar bus?

&gt;I got 3 of 'em for free once!
&gt;
&gt;Ok, so who has been paid to take a bus?

me. but it was an autostick bay - 76 or sumpin. landlord was gonna kick him
out if it didn't go, so he gave me money to have it towed off; i dragged it
home behind my friend's t*yota truck and we used the money to buy tequila
and chase after girls.  eventually cut it up and gave parts to friends
needin' em.
i've had 8 or 9 bays GIVEN to me, passed on 3 more i could've simply towed
home.
splitties in austin have gone from $150 for rex's 59 to $400 for a westy w/
a dinged front door to 800 for the deluxe sunroof to 2K for a rustbucket.

the s/c cost me $400, the 70 cost me 300... at the time, a local 'mechanic'
(ie crook) told me that i'd gotten a 'free bus with my 3/4 length roof
rack.'

i currently have the 70 insured for 3500 'replacement value.'
