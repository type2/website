Thanks for the replies folks.  It is indeed a Weber.  I do remember the
list going on about these now that Chris mentions it.  I'll give it a
rebuild and let ya know how I make out.  Always had good luck rebuilding
carbs so guess it's time to do another.  According to some of the
replies, this carb was used in the Pinto.  I had a Pinto and really
liked it except for the fact that the exhaust got wiped regularly.  It
only caught fire once on a Sunday in Joliette, Quebec.  Try finding fuel
hose and rewiring supplies there after 5pm.  At least I speak French
well enough that the guy at the garage helped me out.

IT'S ALIVE!!!  BWAHAHAHAHAHA
Dave
