  If you are building a 1904, you would have no problem with a FF trans and
would probally enjoy the driveability more

&gt;  Man, I'm getting the vibe that I need to use a stock ratio and get
happier
&gt; with going slower.  Fortunately I don't *have* to use the Interstate.
&gt;
Joe,
I am starting to feel the same way.  I have replaced my small nut with a big
nut reduction boxes to give me a little better top end on my '60.  I have
researched all the different ways to get a higher top speed (freeway flyers,
IRS, lowered swing axel) and to me, it doesn't seem like it's worth the time
and money to do it.  I do plan to put disc brakes on the front!  I've towed
my Love Bug (similar to a scamp) with a 1970 with a 1600cc to Everybus.  It
was a little tough on the long climbs.  I am having a 1904cc built  for
torque not for speed, in order to pull The Love Bug.
