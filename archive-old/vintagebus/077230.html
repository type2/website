&gt; If you have 2 kids, and only one vehicle:
&gt; a) I don't know that I'd own a bus

We have two kids, and indeed we didn't own just the bus.  We also had a
VW bug that was two years older.  The bus is a perfect vehicle for kids,
being roomy and having great visibility.  Ours has served in this way for
over a decade and it looks like it will continue until our children go
off to college.

&gt; b) if my sole vehicle burned down, which is not a common problem among most
&gt; vehicles, I think it may be a little irresponsible to turn around and
&gt; replace it with the same vehicle.

No it isn't.  Having a vehicle burn isn't a common experience, but it
isn't unknown either.  You take precautions to prevent it.

&gt; c) to ask for donations to help this person put herself back in a position
&gt; where she's got (if we're talking about &quot;a bus&quot;, not a Vanagon or newer) at
&gt; least a 24 year old vehicle as a primary means of transporting kids, is
&gt; needlessly selfish.

No, the lady wants to drive a bus, as do most of the people on this list.
Why should we question her choice?

&gt; This kind of reminds me of the $5/plate &quot;spaghetti dinner&quot; held for a guy
&gt; who went to the beach and had $700 stolen car. Duh - do't go to the beach
&gt; and leave $700 in the car! Sure it's only $5 - but if everyone did that you
&gt; could go to $5 dinners every night all year.

Nope, not at all the same thing.  Loading the family in a bus and heading
off to an event isn't irresponsible at all.  I've done it for over a
decade and don't intend to stop.  I've seen a Ford pickup, a Chrysler
minivan, and a Chevy corvette on fire in the last month, so should we
ban those vehicles?  Of course not.

Mat, you are obviously a person who views buses as anacronistic
toys, not as serious tools for living.  Many of us drive our buses every
single day without incident, a fact that you seem to have missed.

There are few other automotive events where the participants care enough
to help out someone who had misfortune along the way.  This is a trait of
the VW community that is very impressive and shouldn't be criticised.

George
