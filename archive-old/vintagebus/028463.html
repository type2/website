I like the raffle idea, but would like to take it two steps further..
lets assume $25 would cover the cost of the bus. There is no way of
knowing how may people would participate. I think we could raise the
price to $35 or $40. This would keep us on track if there were less
participants, and we all know how people tend to bail when its time to
shell out the cash. That is one step.
  If we were to get the expected amount of participants, this would give
us a surplus. I think it would be nice to use that to make a donation to
the one of the groups that helped out our friend who lost his splittie,
but more importantly lost his family tragically, last year. That is step
two. 
I know I would part with $40. For a chance at a nice bus, as well as
helping a good cause!

&gt; &gt; &gt; 500 list members; if everyone kicked in, that would be $12.5k
&gt; &gt; ... raffle ...

&gt; Interesting on the raffle idea, someone emailed me a while back, they wanted
&gt; to set up a raffle for their bus, sell tickets for $20 a pop.  But the catch
&gt; was, they would refund the money if they didn't get at least $10k
