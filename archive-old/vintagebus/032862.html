&lt;&lt; in the oil field. And when oil is above $30 a barrel (42 gallons), I work a
 lot.  Presently I am working so much, my wife is complaining (buy hey, I
 need the money to support my VW habit right?). When oil is less than that,
 the whole oil field suffers.  It may be nice to those soccer moms that want
 to drive the family SUV on the cheap, but people need to realize what is
 happening to the nation as a WHOLE when gas prices are cheap.  Has anyone
 priced how much a gallon of bottled water is going for lately? Better yet,
 how about a gallon of DISTILLED (as in actually processed, like our oil,
 instead of pumped out of the earth.) water? I buy distilled water for work
 on a weekly basis.  I pay up to 92 cents for a gallon.  That's $38.64 a
 barrel.  Hmmm, water more expensive than oil. The earth is literally covered
 with water, and yet it's more than oil.  Now I'm not saying fuel should be
  &gt;&gt;

well, why are you paying so much for it?   oh, I see, you dont want to drink 
the tap water, or the stream wwater, or even the ocean water?   You want the 
drink distilled/ processed water?      Now is the $.92/gal the price if you 
buy it in 40 gallons containers?, or when you buy it in small amounts?     I 
haven't seen anyone selling gas for $30 for 42 gallons to me recently-  it is 
all well over a gallon.  You are comparing retail to wholesale prices, 
refined to unrefined products, and keep switching your comparisons around.   
It dont fly. 

I will bitch about high gas prices if I want to.  

OBC:  er I am still struggling to assemble a truck in pieces  It runs now, 
but  still piecs lying around.  You know that picture of the bug in the idiot 
book, he exploded version with the woman holding a hubcap or something and 
looking around in disbelief, I feel like her, only with a 63 SC.  Actually 
assembly of the cab window frames isn't so tricky, but everything takes time, 
like a jigsaw puzzle with bits missing.  running down to the store to get a 
this, or nuts and bolts or seals, and then a starter  bushing.  pictures will 
be available eventually.

the 'deluxe' door kit from WCM metric does not, for some inscutable reason, 
include the rubber for the wing glass to frame.  However, in the spirit of 
innovation, I used bicycle inner tube, and tool VW743 (or whatever) of local 
manufactor.
