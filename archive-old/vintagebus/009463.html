Here is an update on the trails and tribulations (and profanity) that go along with researching gas gauge and sender issues.

The problem ended up being a bad ground from the sender unit to the bus body.  Please check this first before doing all the other garbage I had to :)

Through this process I removed the gas tank and put the fuel sender through some tests.  I used the old dunk it in water trick to measure if the sender was still working.  To do this you need a battery, fuel gauge, fuel sender, connecting wires, and a bucket of water.  It is very simple by using the wiring layout given in the wiring diagram, but very effective in seeing what is wrong, granted you have to remove all this stuff from the vehicle.  To clarify I am running 12 volts and using the stock 10 Gallon gas tank.

As a note:
- The VDO Cockpit fuel gauge(PN# 301020) reads identically to the stock bus gauge.   In my basement laboratory testing with the same battery, sender, and connecting wires, basically a perfect scenario test.
- The gauge and sender are not 12 volt / 6 volt sensitive.  This is pretty common knowledge.
- According to Dave Easterwood it is very very rare to have a fuel sender go bad and he has not seen a bad one, even with his massive heard of busses :)
- The only way to test the sender is with power going into it.

Hope this helps someone research their gauge problems in the future!  

At least I have a nice clean and restored fuel tank for my troubles...  Minus the birds nest and hornets nest that I found up in that cavity!  Yuck!
