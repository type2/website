Joe, the whole thing is too confusing just get a Tiger 581 CDI.

With the Tiger you can run whatever Dizzy you want and flip them out if need
be.

Cost I think is about the same ~$70.

Also my Tiger 581 got water in it somehow and I sent it back to Universal
Corp and they fixed it without a hitch... For free!  I have been impressed
with their customer support and friendliness.  A quality USA shop all
around.

My $.01,
