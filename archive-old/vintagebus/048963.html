Seems like an easy choice to me. There have been a lot of disappointed people over the years, for all of the reasons that have been hashed out on the list.  It's kind of like the scene Moses came upon.  A captive audience searching for some leadership and direction.  Charlie Hammil rounded up the troups, funneled their energy and led the charge to a new land. (Boy, this is getting deep, if Charlie only knew I was comparing him to Moses.)

I was talking with the infamous Joe Crockett the other evening.  The Santa Barbara contingency will be heading to the OCTO Meet on June 12th.  Hope to see and meet a ton of listees there!
