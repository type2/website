&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Here are a few of the NOS items I have for sale:
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; (1) 211-405-615b brake drum for64-70 type 2 front

If I were not headed to Mexico, and did not already have a sufficient
stash of good used units, I would snag the front drum. The new ones that
are available today are the worst sort of crappola around. A nice NOS
drum would be welcome in my parts room! 

I urge any forsighted splitty owner to snag this item. Since he didn't
give a price, I would put forward that $40 would be a very reasonable
price if it is what he seems to say, a NOS German front drum for 64-67 (
and prolly a few years of loaf too...)...
