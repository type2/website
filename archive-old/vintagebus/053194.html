Subject: Re: [VB] First year of rear bumpers?

&gt; I was just wondering what year was the first year of
&gt; rear bumpers on the type2 ?  I saw a 62 the other day
&gt; with no evidence of ever having a rear bumper.  I
&gt; wasn't sure if it was a bondo-job or factory.
&gt;
It depends on the model.  For instance, I had an early '54 Truck that never
had a rear bumper, no holes were drilled for the brackets.  Trucks were the
last to get a rear bumper but it was in early '54.

You have to look under the Bus to check for the 4 holes for the bumper
brackets.
