Hi,
I own a 67 also, but it's a Sundial Camper.

Anyway, when I installed my Safari's, I went to Home Depot and they had
springs of different diameter that you can use to bend tubing.  I got the
right size diameter spring, which just fit snugly over the antenna, then I
put the antenna, with the spring all the way down to the base of the
antenna, on the edge of my workbench, and simply bent it.  It was really
easy, so I did the second bend in the same way.  I was skeptical about it at
first, so I did it on an old antenna that I didn't care about.  It worked
out really well.

I also got a different type of tubing bender from Sears.  For this one, you
place the device over the antenna, and it has a kind of a hook that fits
around your antenna.  The hook bends the antenna around a curve, which also
fits up against the antenna, and in that way, bend your antenna.  I tried
this one first, and I broke the antenna three different times trying to use
it.

I'd recommend the spring thing, but you should try it on an old antenna
first.

Good luck, and welcome to the list.

Ed

&gt; Jason --
&gt;
&gt; Congratulations from the owner of another '67 Deluxe, that doesn't look
&gt; anything near as good as yours!
&gt;
&gt; Search the Type2_dot_com archives for a brake master cylinder substitution; it
&gt; involves a spacer and some longer bolts. It's how many people upgrade
&gt; earlier buses to a dual-circuit master cylinder. My bus has a replacement
&gt; '67 MC, but it was installed back in the '80s when it cost less...
&gt;
&gt; Changing the front shift bushing inside the front end of the front rod
(this
&gt; is different than on earlier splits) will provide the greatest improvement
&gt; in shifting precision. While you are under there, you can also change the
&gt; front-most of the two bushings on the long shift rod that passes through
the
&gt; tube. Crawl under the back of the bus ahead of the rear tires, look up and
&gt; you'll find the shift coupler. If the rubber looks solid, I'd say keep
it --
&gt; there have been complaints about the quality of today's replacements. If
&gt; it's bad, buy your replacement carefully. Undo the rod from this coupler,
&gt; then go up front and remove the front rod to change the front bushing,
clean
&gt; and lubricate. At this point, you can also slide the long rod forward
&gt; through its tube until its bushing appears. Don't rotate it -- keep its
&gt; alignment intact. You can check the bushing and replace it, if you want,
for
&gt; the second-biggest improvement to precision. (Save replacing the rear
shift
&gt; rod bushing until you ever have the engine and transmission both out --
you
&gt; have to pull the rod out the back of the bus to do this.) Re-tighten the
&gt; shift coupler and put on safety wires; also check the condition of the
&gt; rubber boots on both ends of the shift rod and the front of the
&gt; transmission.
&gt;
&gt; I also use the inexpensive little &quot;short shift&quot; kit at the base of my
&gt; shifter. Having done all this, my shifting is no longer a mystical
&gt; experience.
&gt;
&gt; Can't help with the safari/antenna thing -- you'll see all sorts of
&gt; variations on this in on-line pictures (check www.thesamba_dot_com). Safari
&gt; windows are a liability in year-round &quot;drivers&quot; here in the Northeast...
&gt;
&gt; Good luck!
&gt;
&gt; -- Rich

&gt;
&gt; Hello there list, im new here, but been on vintagvw for years but just
&gt; recently acquired a reason to wander around these here parts.
&gt; http://members.aol_dot_com/jcwfla/bus.jpg  is that reason!
&gt; Ok I bought the bus as a quasi project, its runs and drives (sorta) but
sat
&gt; for a long time and needs lots of things.
&gt; Thing #1 - it needs a master cylinder. Ive changed these on bugs before
and
&gt; thought nothing of it, until seeing that its 1 yr only and $195 at
bus-boys!
&gt; Im sure the seller had a laugh.. i didnt imagine this was the case. Anyone
&gt; rebuild these? Its literally pouring fluid out of the shaft...
&gt; thing #2 - Needs shift bushings, sloppy (doesnt pop out of any gears tho),
&gt; one in the front, what about the coupler in the rear, where is it and how
&gt; hard to get to? (whole job..)?
&gt; thing #3 - has the safari windows and a stock antenna. How do i bend the
&gt; antenna to accomodate the safaris? should I take it to a machine/metal
shop?
&gt; Just put it in a vise and overcompensate the bend to get it in the
ballpark?
&gt; (it bends back).. any ideas?
&gt;
&gt; I think thats the short list for now.. has a few valdez sized oil leaks
too
&gt; but those i can resolve with a quick once over on the motor i
&gt; believe..thanks for any help, pmails fine if you can help me..
