I've experimented with main jets between 122.5 through 135 in my last
rebuild,  a 1600sp semi-hemi cut, totally balanced, 6.6-1 cr , 30 PICT-2
carb, stock exhaust motor.  I tried these jets with 135 and 150 air
correction jets.   For the driving I do Southern Arizona, mostly above
2,000' elevation, the best combination I found is 125 main and 150 air
correction with ignition advance on a 009 at 12.5* btc slow idle.   I've
had good luck with 127.5 mains in dual port engines.  When I used the
135 main jet I found that I had great low end torque.  Stock spark plugs
seemed way too cold to use with this jet.  Also, the fuel economy was
consistently below 20 mpg.  I really should have tried the 135 main with
a 170 air correction jet along with some hot plugs but I still think
that the fuel economy would suffer.  Using the 125 main 150 air combo I
can get an honest 25 mpg at 55 mph.  This is the fuel economy that the
VW  owners manual claims!      Gary Gibson
