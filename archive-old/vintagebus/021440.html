&lt;&lt;  Everett suggested I get a mechanical advance 383 dizzy for a distributor.
 I'm not sure what a 383 dizzy is though.&gt;&gt;
Centrifical advance and no vaccume.  The bus used the former and the bug used
the latter with vaccume tube screwed to the front right side of the carb very
near it's base where it bolts to the intake manifold.

 The plug wires on a 25hp engine go into the side of the distributor cap and
somehow connect in the inside of the cap top.  I still don't understand if I
need special wires or I should just cut the ends off a 36hp set.   Ideas? &gt;&gt;
Just go ahead and cut the distributor end of them.  Eric&amp;Barb
