Subject: re piercings 

well im off to sask to trade my battered 65 bumper complete with
overriders and brackets for two support beams for a roof and a big roof
section - i had a bumper that was in much worse shape than the one im
trading and a bumper shop made it look like new - even better they added
a piece of steel to each end to make a 66 pointed bumper into a slash
bumper for my 59 - im sure you could tell if two buses were side be side
but otherwise you would need a very good eye to see that it is not
original

as for piercings - every time i complian about the body piercing crowd -
im reminded of my father and what he used to say about my long hair (at
least when i had long hair - many years ago) - ditto with music - i mean
hip hop is one thing but how can anybody like the techno stuff - see im
becoming more like my father - sh*t
