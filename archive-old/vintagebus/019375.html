Hi everyone,

I never thought I'd be searching for these, but now I find that I need a
pair.  An old Panel Bus that I'm about to re-activate will need a pair of
those L &amp; R &quot;trucker style&quot; mirrors.  You know the kind...they are large
and rectangular in shape, usually chrome and mounted vertically with
conduit-looking curved mounting tubes that exit each mirror on top and
bottom.  The top arm screws to the upper cab door window frame (just about
the vent window) and  the bottom arm screws into the beltline sheet metal. 
My Bus never had &quot;hinge-mounted mirrors and still have the &quot;domed top&quot;
upper hinge pins in place.  This Panel Bus obviously had a pair of these
&quot;trucker style&quot; mirrors in it's early years, but they were removed and
probably trashed a long time ago, and the holes were never filled.  I may
eventually decide to remove the pins and mount the normal &quot;round style&quot;
mirrors, but since the holes are still there and ready to be used, I
thought I'd try to locate a new or used pair of these &quot;trucker style&quot;
mirrors.

So if you have a decent, complete pair of these mirrors lying about in your
parts pile, new or used, contact me privately if you'd like to move 'em
out.  Let me know what you need for them.  Funky looking or not, I'll try
to give 'em a new home on my '59 Double Door Panel.

Thanks for checking.

Bill Bowman
