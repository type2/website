Subject says it all.  I'm getting things figured out for a rebuild.  I've
always said that if I rebuilt a VW engine, I'd really like to go with a
counterweighted crankshaft.  So, before I go and buy a new one, does anyone
have a good used one they'd like to sell?  I know it's kind of fat chance
but what the hey.

This would be a 69mm crank for a 1600dp engine.  Thanks all...
