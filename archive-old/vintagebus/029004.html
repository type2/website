Subject: RE: You AriDzona guys are nutz!

Paul--You mean there are places in the &quot;Simmer&quot; where it is only 80 degrees? I
was
born and raised in Chicago--I watched my new 71 Pinto rust away in 2 years--When
&quot;IT&quot; drops down to 80 in Phoenix--its time for a jacket!! Somehow our VWs keep
on trucking in the heat--Driving up &quot;THE HILL&quot; outside Phoenix in the &quot;Simmer&quot;
is a real challenge. And speaking of heat--we go thru a lot of 50W oil as
well--We love our VWs here--Next to Caifornia i would say there are more VWs
driven Daily in Arizona more then any other State. At 100 degrees its Top down
weather!  In May , June,  July  &amp; August and half of September--there is nothing
like the feel of 110+ degree heat coming thru your Safari windows--Kind of sends
a chill right down to your bones. Trust me
VWs do not melt---that is so far--Vintage VW? drive-um!  TWWM, uj
PS: Go Cubbies!!
