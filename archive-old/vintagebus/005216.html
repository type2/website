Is it possible to have passenger bus cargo doors on a panel from the
factory? I was taking the doors off my 61 double door panel and they
actually look like they came like that. If it is possible, shouldn't there
be a M code? I need to find out about this before I go hunting for panel
doors (2 sets) that I may not need. Anybody got a decklid for this bus too?
I really need one.
