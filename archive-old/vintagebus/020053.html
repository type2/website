I measured the trim strip on my 77 Westy....it is 45''
long. I measured the door opening on my 66 Deluxe...
it is 46''. Even though the bay strip is an inch
short, 

**wouldn't you have to cut it in the middle because of
the lower cargo door latch pins?**
------------
NO! the trim strip sits back enough so that the doors
can close. The edge of the pre-68 &lt;not pre-67 like
alot of folks insist on stating!!!&gt; flooring sits back
away from the inside edge of the cargo doors. This
aluminum strip is one piece on the splitty buses. I
saw this one piece strip on a '69 bay this AM. It's
thinner and not the same.
