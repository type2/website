&gt; &gt;Is the camber compensator for the back better than a rear anti-sway?
&gt; 
&gt; The camber compensator supposedly returns the wheels to an upright position
&gt; on lowered vehicles. It does this by unlowering them. It is, plain and
&gt; simple, a weak helper spring. It is only a helper spring on lowered buses,
&gt; on stock height it tends to pull the bus down lower. Installation is simple.
&gt; Loosen the appropriate four bolts on your tranny/differential side covers.
&gt; Replace with longer studs if you like, but once you realize what is going on
&gt; here you won't want to be seen with one. Bolt the center bracket on 
 (snip)

Kyle and the list: 

I disagree.
The center section of the spring is free to move, and therefore
transfers pull from one side to the other, making less of a rear-end yaw
in corners and when being passed by large trucks. Helper springs are
independent on each side. This is an important distinction.

In practice, my stoick height bus is much nicer to drive with the
compensator. The only drawback is it makes the gear oil drain plug hard
to access.
