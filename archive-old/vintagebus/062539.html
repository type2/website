Man, I wish I could buzz out there again Jamie, you have such a WONDERFUL
place for a bus campout, but 24 hours one way is a bit much during the
school year.

I would love to represent the state that John Brown fought for, Kansas.
Some say John Brown was crazy, guess he would have fit right in with this
bus hobby!!

Good luck on the campout, please take plenty of bus pics and post them.

&gt; Time is getting close to John Brown's Buses held in Harpers Ferry, West
&gt; Virginia.  The campout is 66 mile from Washington D.C. and 68 miles from
&gt; Baltimore.  I created a site with some information and local
&gt; attractions.  http://www.home.earthlink_dot_net/~theauchs/JBB.htm.
&gt; Hope to see you!
