Subject: Ignition dead?

I think the dynamo died last week, sypmtoms were there, bus ran fine but
then lights started to dim/get bright with revs, and then once home there
was zilch when it was stopped and restarted.

So, I renewed some dodgy looking spade connectors between the dynamo and the
regulator(is that what it's called?) on the firewall, and I was going to
check the output of this (should be around a 12V DC out right?) to confirm
where the problem was lying - what is the input to this regulator? 12V AC?

Anyhow, had my SO in the cab on starting duty with newly charged battery,
and she turned on the electrics, got red light, got solenoid click, but then
as soon as she tried to start it, there was another click up front and
nothing. All fuses are present and correct, 12V into the fusebox OK, but
nothing is getting power. Is there anything back there likely to burn  out?
It all looks OK...
