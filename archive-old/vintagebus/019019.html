&gt; &gt;I have these in stock also, but do not sell them as they are a very

&gt; &gt;&quot;TRANSPORTER WORKSHOP MANUAL, 1955-1967 Reprint of early English
&gt; &gt;publication&quot;
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; I have an 'original' of one of these... my copy is NOT a bad xerox; 
&gt; it came
&gt; in a red and gray cover, reading:
&gt; &quot;Type II Transporter series 1200-1600 shop Manual&quot; The quality is as 
&gt; good
&gt; as the Bentley reprint of the splitty manual. The bitch is that it 
&gt; has NO
&gt; publisher, NO ISBN, NO address or identifying mark AT ALL. All I can 
&gt; tell
&gt; you is that I got it at Book People here in Austin years ago, when 
&gt; they
&gt; were a REAL bookstore; now, without an ISBN, they can't find their 
&gt; own
&gt; heads.
&gt; Should any other copies turn up, I will snag them for a List buy.
&gt; 
&gt; The WW version is apparently a xerox of the title page on.
