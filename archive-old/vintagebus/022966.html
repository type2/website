Subject: Westfalia Lead - Roseville
Mime-Version: 1.0


A friend of mine bought a car Sunday at the John L Sullivan Chevy dealer in
Roseville, CA, and someone had just traded in an early westy on a new GM
car - they got a $1000 trade-in (but no K-Y).  She saw it parked out back,
and confirmed it had the 3 window on the sides with the jealousy (sic)
windows - jealousy 'cause you're jeaulous that you ain't got one!

That's all I have - you're on your own.
