Subject: BBB Thanks &amp; Dead Motor
To: VintageBus_at_type2_dot_com

From Chris Burke...

&quot;Thank yoy to everyone on the list who helped out when I was broken down on 
the way to BBB, especially Ronnie who was juggling microphone and telephone, 
Kyle, Betto and everyone else.&quot;

he's back now and from fooling with the motor to see what the noise is, I 
came to one conclusion... It's broke!  Totally Dead.

Chris explained to me about when the sound started. Aproximatelt around 50-55 
mph.  Also he stated that it didnt gradually get louder but just in a split 
second started knocking like mad.  

I will get into the guts of the motor sometime this week.

Now I am in the situation of letting someone borrow a bus which was running 
fine to begin with and blowing a motor while they had it on the road.  I have 
never been in this before and I am looking for some tips to help keep this 
from ruining a great VW friendship.  Anyone have some basic &quot;guidelines?&quot;  He 
has offered up some $$$ to help with the rebuild which seemes fine with me.  
Im not lloking for a whole lot or anything.  There hasnt been any fighting or 
squabbling about it so I hope it remains that way.  Just looking for some 
insight from some of you who have done this.

Thanks Again
Dan Howard
