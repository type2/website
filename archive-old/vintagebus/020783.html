&gt; &gt; &gt; Hey,
&gt; &gt; &gt; I've noticed that a lot of cars for sale on the
&gt; 'net
&gt; &gt; &gt; or in online auctions have the license plate
&gt; removed
&gt; &gt; &gt; or purposely blurred-out in the pics.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Why is this?
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Is there some risk involved with people knowing
&gt; your
&gt; &gt; &gt; plate?
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I can only imagine that someone thinks that a perp
&gt; will look up the 
&gt; license
&gt; &gt; plate and then hightail it over to the registered
&gt; address with a 
&gt; flatbed and
&gt; &gt; remove the vehicle in the dead of night.
&gt; 
&gt; It also prevents buyers (and law enforcement) from
&gt; running a Carfax or 
&gt; DMV check on the vehicle.  It wouldn't do for the
&gt; buyer to find out 
&gt; that the vehicle doesn't really belong to the seller
&gt; or that the 
&gt; vehicle was in a major accident etc.
&gt; 
&gt; Buyer beware!
&gt; 
&gt; George
