sounds like good karma to me, if the man cherished his bus , and then after
being murdered, managed to take one more ride in the bus , and besides maybe
when the valves get tight he will tap you on the shoulder and remind you to
tune.........
besides all that, have you tried looking up the old newspaper articles on
the murder, you might find some nice pictures of the bus, or you might find
that the old antique dealer is pulling your leg, either way you should also
use the story to leverage down the price a little,
maybe the ghost rider is keeping the old witch away with those clutch
problems and waiting for the right guy to come along

&gt; The previous owner cherished his VWs and really kept them up well.
&gt; Unfortunately, he was murdered and his body was hauled away in this bus
and
&gt; dumped.  The bus was used in a murder but I've camped in it and there is
&gt; nothing weird like ghosties or anything like that.&quot;
&gt;
&gt; Now I'm not superstitious and I have strong religeous views on the
&gt; supernatural so it shouldn't really bother me but riding in a hearse is
bad
&gt; enough - more or less a bus that is known to have been involved in a
murder.
&gt; And with Lillian gone - man - what karma and vibes I had felt were just
&gt; about destroyed.
