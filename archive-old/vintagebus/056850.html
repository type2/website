&gt; Ugh, I'm thoroughly depressed.  I have been dinking around with the Berg kit
&gt; for almost 6 hours and it doesn't work.  The primary piece that is riveted 
&gt; on works okay but the next piece isn't going to cut it.  It needs to be 
&gt; spaced out some and I think the item they included was just a stock size 
&gt; aftermarket piece of tin (the one that goes from the shroud to the exit 
&gt; duct).  I think I'm going to use another shroud and the stock cooler for 
&gt; now and dink around with this stuff later.

Hi Thomas,
Sounds strange that Berg does not supply a modified exhaust shell!

&gt; Do you have any pictures of your mods?  I ask because the one thing I like 
&gt; about the Berg tin is that it has a nice transition from the shroud to the 
&gt; T4 cooler.  I'd be interested in seeing how you did it to compare methods.  
&gt; Clara mentioned that she got a setup from you in trade.  Any interest in 
&gt; modifying one of my shrouds and tin for $$ if I can't get this stuff to 
&gt; work?

If you continue to have problems we can talk some more about doing one for 
you.  Shipping is pricey nowadays though.
