&gt;Amen to this.  Thank God the guy who sold me my 62 low mileage double cab was
&gt;an ethical seller.  He promised me that since I was the first to call, I
could
&gt;be the first to see it.  A VERY well known VW person in the Canyon Country
area
&gt;insisted he let him look at it the night before I was scheduled to see it.  

I remember this story.  :)  And every time it brings a really big smile to
my face.  Gosh it's nice to pull one over the big guys (who all know who
they include).  *hums the Underdog theme*
