Tonight I measured all the journals of my crank to make sure that it's a
.10/.10 grind and it is.

Next I measured the insides of the rebuild rods on the big end and came up
with 2.270&quot; average between the 4 but I couldn't find the spec for a rebuilt
T1 1600 rod.  Are rebuilts merely honed (per the Tom Wilson rebuild book) or
s there a spec for the large end on the rod???

Another question is - when the case is bored .60/.80 - what order is this?
Is this align/thrust or thrust/align?  Once I know this, I an order my
bearings.  Thanks!!!
