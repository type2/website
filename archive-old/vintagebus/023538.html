&lt;&lt; Did anyone see the slammed show bug at the Classic this year? Near the 
toy/souvenir tent. A purple bug completely flattened, as in destroyed, to the 
ground, surrounded by ropes, other doo-dads. I think it was called Crushed 
Velvet. They had awards, pics from other shows. Great satire. Anybody have 
pics?  &gt;&gt;

 Yeh......that was  Deans at Hot VWs.......we had a great time &quot;building&quot; 
it.........

not sure what to build for next year, does anyone still have the &quot;worlds 
fastest bus&quot; from Bug O Rama years ago ?  maybe we need to restore it !!!!!!
