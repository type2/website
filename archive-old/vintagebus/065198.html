Subject: Re: [VB] Belly pans

&gt; Hi everybody,
&gt; 
&gt; Were belly pans originally installed on all busses
&gt; from the factory?  I have the front splash pan but I
&gt; am wondering about the ones that cover the center
&gt; section.  
&gt; Thanks for your help.

They are original, but just on buses with big holes in
the roof (bigger than your normal pop top), and buses
with doors on both sides.
