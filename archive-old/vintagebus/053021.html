&lt;&lt; I pulled the glass Saturday AM and had a bigger rust problem than I could 
see before.&gt;&gt;

Hi Rich,
Once one can see the rust it is the tip of the iceberg!

&lt;&lt; ... all this effort (sigh) just to get ready for the gaskets.&gt;&gt;

Yup!  On our 1960 panel camper conversion we had to reconstruct the lower 
corners and much of the bottoms of the window frames.  Lace is nice, but not 
in sheet metal!
 
&lt;&lt; As I was putting the gasket on the windshield (passenger side) I was using 
a condiment bottle to squirt in the tar.  This made a huge mess that I will 
be cleaning up for a while.&gt;&gt;

We apply a very thin bead of tar inside the groove the glass seats inside of 
before installing the glass/rubber into the frame.  Trying to apply the tar 
after glass/rubber installation makes it very hard to do the top section of 
the seal properly due to gravity and the non-BD fresh air overhang.  Plus the 
seal is under pressure inside the frame which makes it hard to get the tar in 
there even more.  Better to have a bit of a tar mess to clean up now, that 
more rust later!
