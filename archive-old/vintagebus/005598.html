and just imagine that most of the posts like this kept me in the game. After
about a week of uncertainty I decided to go and bring the 65 home and start
working on it to put it on the road in the spring.  It's something that most
people don't even notice. Not a day goes by that I don't think about VW's.
Busses are my second love right after my wife and kids. I'm surrounded with
them at home (models, books, part catalogs, parts all over my house) and at
work with a couple of them on my desk.  For some odd reason I can't stay
away. Well, thanks for letting me vent...............

I know it's not Friday, I couldn't wait, sorry.
I'll shut-up now,


Andre

&gt; Does anyone else see a connection between Rex's posts and NQ's?  Its great
to see
&gt; people getting excited about working on T2s again.  Way to go Rex.  Keep
it up!
&gt; You and NQ keep me motivated.  Believe me, I need all the motivation I can
get.
