was writ:

I'm with George on this one. Why not ditch all the
Type 3's and go with all buses, bugs, things, and Type
1 Ghias? 

If pre-12-volt is where it's at, why do so many people
convert their 6-volt cars?

if you start your own show, you can decide who can come in.
Choose a nice grassy place where people can camp for the weekend.   Tell 
everyone.  Cool, more is better.

I dont know why people convert from 6V. SOme people think you can't drive on 
6V, that when you get an old VW you HAVE to convert it or it'll something 
horrible.   For the record, I did convert  a 59 truck to 6V.  People would 
comment on the truck, as they do, and I would say ya it's 6V.  I was told I 
could convert it to 12V, and I would enjoy telling them I had switched it 
back to 6V.  :)

if Kelley park gets bigger, they may well decide only split and oval window 
bugs, and 1967 and earlier buses, like the european vintage shows.  THough I 
m am sure  it would include the SA '75 splitty.
