&lt;&lt; NO Clutch - Clearly I've screwed up my clutch some how .... but how? &gt;&gt;
Hi John,
Sounds like you need to adjust the clutch cable nut or wing nut on the rear 
end of this cable till you have only 1/2 to 3/4&quot; easy play you have now 
before it gets harder to push down the rest of the way to the floor.  Easiest 
way to do this is to measure the distance with a straight edge and ruler from 
the pressure plate area that the TO bearing rides on to the flange area of 
the engine case where the engine mates/seats directly to the tranny bell 
housing.  Then measure the TO bearing (Near the pivots of the TO bearing to 
it's TO shaft arms.) surface that pushes against the pressure plate the 
distance to the flange area of the tranny bell housing.  What you want is the 
TO bearing should be about 1/8&quot; from the pressure plate when you have the 
engine back in.  When you make these measurement and adjust the clutch cable 
with the engine out it saves you a good 1/4 to 1/2 hour of adjusting with the 
engine in, on your back with one of your arms above your body.  Uggg!
