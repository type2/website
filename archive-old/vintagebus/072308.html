&lt;&lt; The instrument console is too hard to remove so I estimate my speed and

fwiw, for the dash bulbs, you only have to remove the bulb holder-  reach 
under neath, find it (follow wire), pull down on the edge of the bulb holder, 
swap out bad bulb for good, put holder back into socket.   No cluster needing 
removal.  should take a few minutes.

or are you talking about a bay window bus?   ackk
