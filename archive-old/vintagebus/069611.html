Subject: H4 Wiring one last question PLease?

I've looked at Matts write up and I've been to Stern Lighting page.  The one
thing I don't understand is I keep the Dimmer relay in circuit (that I
understand)  But does the power wire from the #56 terminal still send power to
the lights along with the relay? and will this cause an issue when running
power to the relays for the lights.  I plan on running 3 10G wires from the
back for low beam/high beam and Hella driving lights.  I just a bit confused
on running from the dimmer switch

Can I just buy any 4 prong dimmer switch to use, since mine was a big barrel
looking thing with 5 or 6 hook ups.

Dave
