Since Rick won't see this till Monday, I'll respond for him. He was given
permission to repro these manuals from espar because it is a fundraiser for

as I think he's probably got his bases covered!

&gt; I'm not trying to be a cop or anything, but wouldn't photocopying manuals
and then selling them, even for a good cause, be considered slightly
illegeal in, oh, just about anywhere?
&gt;
&gt; Just a thought
