Subject: Road Trip or am I crazy?

Alright here's the plan I have about 4 weeks of vacations saved up.  
Planning on driving from Lemoore, CA to Tampa, FL and back taking in the 
sights along the way.  I need to stop off in OK either on the way or on the 
return trip to see my mom, but other than that the trip is wide open.  Was 
planning on taking my '66 Sundial w/ stock tranny and reduction boxes, 1600 
cc.  Some of the mods I will be doing prior to this trip are installing a 
set of Kadron's going to a dual circuit brake sys. and gettting new tires 
and brakes and I would really really really like to install a larger fuel 
tank.  I also need to aquire a tire tool or star that fits my bus I won't 
have the air tools on the road.  Well am I crazty?  I mean should I just 
leave the bus at home and drive the Mercury?  It's just me a my little dog a 
Jack Russel Terrier.  I have driven from Long Island NY to Porstmouth Va and 
on to CA before in 3 days, but that was just stupid and in a Chev Cavalier.

Thanks in advance and I really apreciate your advice.
