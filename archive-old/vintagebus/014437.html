Subject: RE: [VB] 68 Puck...  plus

Sorry Everett, there is some miscommunication here.  John's e-mail says it
best which is attached.

There are two sites people are referring to &quot;VWPlanet&quot;.
I was thinking it was www.vwplanet_dot_com where Jim Ellis is referring to
www.thesamba_dot_com

Yes, Everett your site is very good and of course I mean no disrespect since
we (I) was not on the same page with everyone else :)

I have been doing some more research on the teardrop trailers and it seems
that dry weight for an 8' is about 500 pounds (with steal frame - no one
apparently does aluminum).  Figure wet weight 750-800 pounds.  I spoke with
George from http://teardropparts_dot_com/ and he said he used to tow a teardrop
with a '67 with a 1776cc motor (a Japanese guy made him an offer to sell the
bus he could not refuse - might be in Japan now).  Also he put me in line
with a man in Indianapolis that makes kits for teardrops, Jim Lender
888-809-3835, who also tows a teardrop with a bay(year unknown).  Jim's kits
also have swingaxle suspension which uses VW wheels (not sure if it is wide
5 or not) instead of the cruddy solid rear and leaf springs .  Hopefully I
will have more to report later...

I have had a few replies saying that a 1776 is perfect for trailering...  I
would go this route except I have been stockpiling type4 parts for a 1.8 or
2.0 conversion already.

&gt; How did it get from VWPlanet to thesamba?  Maybe Jim sent us on a
&gt; wild goose chase :)

That's 'cause VWplanet IS http://thesamba_dot_com/vw (aka Everett's
site). Everett the VB list member owns a 55 barndoor kombi. I did
check out Vwplanet_dot_com so now I can understand the confusion. I've
always called Everetts site vwplanet (thesamba_dot_com/vw) and don't know
where the other website came from. 

I wonder if Everett knows about the vwplanet_dot_com website.

FYI - on ebay there is a user vwplanet, but that's not Everett, I
think he uses everettb (or something like that). This was mentioned
on the VB list awhile back. As you can see, even tho' I'm a lurker, I
spent way TOO much time on the internet.

Wow, really?  No one has ever complained before, please email me with your
issues.  In fact, I get 2-5 emails/day stating the opposite experience.

I went to the Search page of the Classifieds:
http://www.thesamba_dot_com/vw/classifieds/classifieds.mv?search
and typed in &quot;Puck&quot; (no quotes) and Jim's ad came right up as the first
entry of 8 ads with &quot;Puck&quot; in them.

Jim writ:
&quot;'68 Eriba Puck $4500. see VWPlanet ad&quot;

Is it me or is VWPlanet impossible to navigate and the search does not work.
Too fancy for its own good...  I have no idea who runs this site, so please
take it as constructive criticism.  Is there a detailed explanation on how
to view information about the Puck...  For the simple minded people like
myself :)
