&gt; Once I got home, a whole 'nother drama unfolded which basically 
&gt; ruined all
&gt; the good things that happened throughout the day.  I ended up 
&gt; walking home
&gt; about 2.5 to 3 miles at 10:30 at night down some real dark streets 
&gt; and alley
&gt; ways.  I had my knife clutched in some kind of a translike death 
&gt; grip but
&gt; managed to get home in about 30 minutes.
&gt;

	OK, OK, so why were you walking home at 10:30 at night?
