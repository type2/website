Thanks for the hint.  Am I going to find a burned wire?  I checked the
connections already, and all SEEM well.  I noticed the cover at the
connection of the light switched seemed like it had been hot, but I don't
know if this happened today or 10 years ago.  If the wire is burned,
wouldn't it be likely that I would be able to see it on the wire itself? 
Until it hits the wire cover, it looks fine.
