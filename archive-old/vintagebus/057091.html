&gt; I checked the net and some other sources and am looking at about $200, with my core, before tax and shipping.

Yup, they're pretty much the only game in town.  Bend over and squeal like a pig, boy!
$200 bones is a LOT for ~$5 of new bushings, but you gotta grab the K-Y unless you can
do it yourself.

&gt; I have also been told that the new Brazillians are junk.

Yup.  Some suppliers are trying to foist those off as &quot;NOS locking columns&quot;  I actually
bought one.  No Way Jose is that going to work in a split.
