&gt;     My buddy recently purchased a 67 21 window rag. His bod isn't too
&gt; bad(needs the usual rockers, doglegs, and has some minor window lip rot),
&gt; but after I finally got to see it today, I noticed his frame rails are shot.
&gt; I have a 65 that I am parting out and it has perfect frame rails. I don't
&gt; think I need to explain what I am getting at. I swap pans on type 1's all
&gt; the time, but it doesn't appear to be as easy on a bus. Any ideas????

First off, I'll do all I can to avoid commenting on your friend's bod.  I'm
sure he's a really nice guy and all...

Anyway, a bus does NOT have a removable pan.  You *CAN* replace the frame,
but it's a lot of work.  I'm getting ready to do this on my '54 (for the
second time &lt;*sigh*&gt;).  What might be the trick for his bus is to replace
the rusted out pieces in situ, one by one.  You could section in the 65's
frame rails, but you have 2 long rows to hoe: one cutting them out, and one
welding them in.  These pieces are also available repro. Check out
http://www.ahschofield.co_dot_uk/

(PS: Does your '65 have a good nose?  I need one for my '54)
 
&gt; P.S.-What exactly is a Samba? I originally thought it referred to a 21
&gt; window or the like but lately I have seen it when referring to trucks as
&gt; well. Is this like an option package or something? lol. Seriously, I dont
&gt; know and was just curious. Vote me in for stupid question of the week, I
&gt; dont care! Thansk again!

Nope, trucks are not sambas, although there *is* a samba-like truck on my site.
