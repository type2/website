&gt; I don't really know body work but I need to sand out the rust in the engine

&gt; use, I'm gonna do por-15.

Kevin,

You should try varios sizes of wire wheels on a drill. Wear eye protection
as well - no  kidding on this. You could also consider having someone sand
blast large areas for you, but patience and several wire wheels on a
decent drill should work fine.
