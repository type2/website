Subject: 3D Paper single cab &amp; deluxe model kits.  Where???

Does anyone remember the link for the folding paper
kits of the Barn Door deluxe or single cab?  The link
was posted a year or so ago but i can not locate it.

There was about 10 pages per model of cut and past
parts to make a 3D model.

Thanks

Matthew
