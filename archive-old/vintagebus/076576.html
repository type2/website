Do you mean the same thing by Samba that all of us do?  A 21/23 window?

67 Deluxe Bus
75 914 1.8 (for sale)

&gt; As an aside I have a 67 Samba Non walk through sliding door model.  There
are
&gt; no belly pans fitted nor can I see any sign of them being fitted. I  was
told
&gt; all Sambas had belly pans. Is this another urban myth? Mike
&gt; PS I haven't seen the Deluxe sill trim fitted to any Sliding door  models,
&gt; has any listee?
