Subject: '59 out of storage help

I'm getting my '59 out of winter storage and am having a hard time getting it 
to fire up. It started up fine last month. I think the battery is charged 
well and it just cranks... that's it. I hooked a jumper vehicle up to it and 
that didn't seem to help much. I was thinking I may try to go get a gas tank 
and put some fresh gas in it tommorow.
Any other tips? 
Thanks for your help,
Pete
