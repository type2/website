&gt; George, All,
&gt; Driving insanely fast down some dusty roads north of Flagstaff, AZ,
&gt; I've noticed that the fine red volcanic dust neatly adhered to the
sides
&gt; of the &quot;scooped&quot; '67.  The dust adhersion was thickist past the rear
&gt; cargo doors, actually aiming towards/into the scoops.  This makes me
&gt; think that the air does flow fairly smoothly over the bus body.

A couple of thoughts:

Have you considered that the reason for the thicker dust buildup is
that the air near the surface of the bus isn't flowing as fast (or
perhaps with more turbulence) in that part of the bus?

Since the dust is kicked up by the front wheels, I would expect
buildup to be heaviest toward the rear of the bus.  

&gt; The
&gt; &quot;scoops&quot; built into the loafs is placed high enough to where the
cooling
&gt; air is a bit cleaner.  I notice that the engine compartments in well
&gt; sealed non-scooped buses are much hotter than scooped.  They are also
&gt; much cleaner.

That's interesting.  Something I'd like to measure.  I happen to have
the sensors to do this.  Anyone want to test the theory with their
splitty in the north end of LA county?

&gt; My engines seem to run too cool.  The scoops are a bit
&gt; over the top in the '67 6.6-1 CR 1600sp.  Gary Gibson  Tucson,  AZ

Might be.  Still, better too cool than too hot!  You could build
butterfly valves into the openings of your scoops! :)
