Just to mix it up; when I was re-covering my seats, stapled underneath the
yellow/black material on one of the seats was a large swatch of *orange* &amp;
black material!  It was hideous!

&gt; Well, my all original EARLY '59 Westfalia (production date of 11/5/58) is an SO-23 kit with yellow and black wool, so that throws out the previously posted logic.  My understanding is that the color of the wool fabric is not indicative of the year, but of the exterior color of the bus.  Dove Blue bus = yellow/black.  Mango Green/Sea Gull Grey bus = yellow/black.  Red/White bus = red/black.
