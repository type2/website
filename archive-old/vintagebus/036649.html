Hi all,

This really does work! My father learned this trick while he was  in the
army doing long range patrols in Namibia and Botswana (sub Saharan Africa)
and taught me about it when I was a kid.  We used to go trout fishing and on
the way back from a stream he would cook up a couple of stuffed trout on the
exhaust manifolds of his V8 engined Range Rover. He rigged up a pair of wire
baskets that sat on the manifolds so he could regulate the temps by raising
or lowering the height of the baskets. If you try it out be sure to wrap the
food really well and fold the edges of the tin foil tight or it will get
engine oil flavoured.

Later 

Michael
