There was some talk a little while back about vehicle dollies. They're on
sale at Harbor Freight now - $60 for two, $100 for 4. And since they weigh
50 lbs, shipping is free.

Also of interest?:

750 lb engine stand - it's got adjustable arms, so looks like it'd work for
a VW....anyone?? - for $40, and if you add another 3 lbs to the order,
shipping's free.

They also have a portable car garage. Couldn't find the same one online, but
in the print catalog they have one on sale for $249. It's16' L x 8' W x 7'
H. Their online catalog has larger and smaller ones, but not for that price.
