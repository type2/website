Hi,
We are in need of an early (58down) rear bumper for our 1958 Deluxe in any
condition - no trim OK. Please e-mail offers to vwboop_at_direct_dot_ca. Our
insurance co. won't let us register our bus if it's missing major body parts
(like a bumper) and we'd love to be driving it so your offers would be
appreciated. Thanks. Chris &amp; Gina
