&lt;&lt;The carb leaked at the accelerator pump rod area, scary thought. So much 
elese is new, i am going to replace the carb anyway,as big screw wouldn't 
even change idle above 800 rpm, never leaned out. &gt;&gt;

Hi AL,
Best to take the carb apart to rebuild it and check for proper jetting.

&lt;&lt; Pays to triple check outher poeple's work, double check yours.&gt;&gt;

Absolutely!
 
&lt;&lt; Must redo the gaskets on the bearing caps, getting some trans oil seepage 
out there, not kewl. Might go to silicone here? &gt;&gt;

This in the RGB plugs for 1964-67 bus?  We use a line of silicon sealant on 
these areas just before bolting the swing plates on.    Eric&amp;Barb
