I seemed to have mis-written the address to my homepage showing Bad Camberg
photos. There should not be the 3W in the address, so it should read

http://glen_dot_denmark.webjump_dot_com/

Sorry about that.

Folks might also like to check Tonny's Barndoor page and his BC links at

http://hjem.get2net.dk/vw_barndoors/camberg.htm

This includes a great link to a page with 360 panorama shots of the BC
field.
