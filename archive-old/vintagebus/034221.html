When you go to mvd ask them to run a check on precious owners.
if they come up with a name, you need to send a certified letter to that
person asking for a copy of the title, after 3 delivery attempts (if the
person isn't there) you will get back the unopened letter.
you then take that to mvd (the unopened letter) with the bond (your
insurance agent can give you the bond) and they will issue title on the
spot.
make sure you get the previous owner search first, i have been dicking with
mvd over this, went in with a noterized bill of sale, went to a different
teller, this one ran the title search and came up with a name, so sent out
the cert letter., second time, but to the right person and address, so when
i get the letter back i will post the bond ($50.00) and get the title.
in the mean time they gave me a 90 day permit.

Subject: [VB] Needing a title in AZ


  I am new to the list and am requesting information about getting a bonded 
title for a 1959 single cab in Phoenix Arizona.
Bought this bus and have been getting the run a round from the DMV for about

a year.  It has already been inspected by the DMV and I do have a notarized 
bill of sale.  What I am asking for is directions or someone to walk me 
through the process(of getting a bonded title) with  the names of &quot;Bonding 
Companies&quot;? or people that can help me out.  The car is legal, there are no 
liens.  I have no name of the person whos name the title was in last.  
Please help!
