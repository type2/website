Subject: Everybus/ What did I do to the engine?

Just as I pulled into Everybus, I noted that there was a little more smoke
that normal, but have a leaky oil cooler, so was not concerned. Spent the
weekend socializing and losing the chili cookoff, and losing the best
campsite prize. :-)

Topped off the oil, lost about ¼ quart on the trip down. Sunday as I pulled
out all started ok, no worries.

Got gas at about 10 miles and had a little start problem. Humm???

30 more miles and started noticing a loss of power. Looked at the trees. Not
that much head wind. Then &quot;the smell&quot; hit me. Hot and pulled over. Ouch,
VERY VERY HOT. Dumping a fair amount of oil.

After cooling down made an unscheduled trip to Farmington for an engine. I
found a turnkey that sounded nice but I did not have the bread and he would
not take a credit card or check.

I made it back by going slow with frequent rests and a very long stop before
heading up the mountain into 20 degree cooler weather. The nice folks from
Good Ole Volks caught my back door in the event of a complete failure; I
would have been able to get home with them. You have to give a lot of credit
to guys that will stick with you that long.

My question: What did I do to this engine? Got really hot. Jamie shot his
thermometer at it and was 240 on the case and 350 on the heads, but that was
after cooling down and 10 miles of flatland going 40 to 45mph. My plan is to
check the valve clearances, then compression, then jank it to put Urge's (71
bus) engine in. What would you do?

After cooling down, I estimate the engine was running on about 75% of normal
power. Hills I take at 38 in third were struggling at 30 or going to second
gear.
