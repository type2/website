The latest on the barn stash saga:

I was waiting for the 91 year old gentleman to get back to me, he was trying
to contact the next of kin to unload the barn.
3 days later I get a call from him, he never did get ahold of the heirs to
the pile so he had a scrap metal guy come by.  He wanted this guy to  cut up
his truck frame and haul it off, well the guy did and took all of the barn
contents while he was at it!!!

GONE, every last exhaust valve!

And to think I drove 1 hour with box trailer to go get it and he  said he
had to get ahold of the deceased's family!

He gave it to the scrap man!

Maybe my next Chevy truck front fender will be made out of some of this
German steel!

I guess I have more than my share anyway...
