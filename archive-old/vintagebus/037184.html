&lt;&lt; Here is my story...Mine came with my '65. The P.O. didn't like the look
 of it, so he welded in some extra braces. I was towing the bus with a
 '96 V6 Ranger, and soon realized that I couldn't safely drive on the
 freeway. I do however, find it extremely handy for in-town usage.
 
 my .02 cents...

I bought a &quot;Dr. joe tow bar&quot; from jerry jess in phoenix, Attached it 
correctly**
(62 panel towed by 2000 Ford f150) and hauled ass through the salt river 
canyon (winding road) hit the interstate at 85mph all the way to Albuquerque 
(450 miles). The tow bar didn't bend or crack. The best of all tow bars is 
Barry's (Bus co-op) Bolt to the &quot;bumper bracket bolt holes style&quot; made for 
59-67 Splits, it's a rock solid way to tow. Maybe JP would post some PICS of 
it.
