Hi Folks
If your sitting here,, looking for something to do...  It looks as if the
Rain has passed and you want to go camping!!  Friday to Sunday,,,  come out
for the day or just one night,, or the entire weekend

There is the Old Bus Campout #4 near Holland Center.
Wear your Vw appearel. Door Prizes,fishing hiking canoeing swimming

 This is just SOUTH of Owen Sound, and near Hwy 6 on Hwy 10.
When you get to Holland Center,on Hwy 10 ,  turn East  on the main cross Rd,
Queen St, and follow that.
There will be signs,, about 3-4 miles down the road Past Participation Lodge
on the south,[your right], will be a large Round Hay Bale on the south,[your
right] , with Old Bus Campout Painted on it,,
The Hay bale Sign  is on the south side of the Rd,[your right] ,,opposite a
Shed that is very near the rd on the North side. ,[your left]
If you go tooo far,, you will hit the end of the Rd at a Tee intersection,
Turn around and go back 1500 ft and look for the hay bale again!  Big Round
White thing with Words on it......

Follow that lane till you get to the Campfire!
If you still can't find it,,, your not a &quot; Real VeeDuber&quot;  as you  should be
able to Sense the presence of Old Buses in the Bush!

Bring everything you need,, there is alot of Nature there,, fishing hiking
canoeing swimming....
If you don't bring it,,, don't expect it to be there,,
