&lt;&lt; There are so many reasons for low MPG from not using a pressure regulator 
on 
 a electric fuel pump, bad jetting,bad wheel bearings, too low of tire 
 pressure, or too high of RPMs.  We just got back from Sacramento getting 22 
 MPG instead of 24+ MPG apparently due to a leaky mecahnical fuel pump 
 diaphram (Drat!) with our SP DR 1641cc engine in our 1960 panel .  Weather

....ya- I had a leaky mechanical fuel pump (past diaphagm, not into the case) 
recently and after I replaced it, my power went up and i think the gas milage 
went up 1-2 mpg around town as well.
