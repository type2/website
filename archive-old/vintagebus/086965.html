Subject: Rubber bushings again.

Hi,

Any thoughts about replacing just the outer rubber bushings?
Just looked at the .pdf parts manual I downloaded. Shows an inner bushing 
(can't replace without removing the arm) and an outer bushing.

What's the right procedure to remove the cap? I am guessing that the vehicle 
should be lifted until the arm is just bottomed to relieve the stress and to 
put the torsion arm into as neutral a position as possible.

Chris
