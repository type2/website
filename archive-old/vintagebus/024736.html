Oh, not nearly as rare as a splittie hearse!  Your duty  should be to pass
along the info for the DC RHD to your friends on the list.  I think bye
law 11382 section A, (or is it section B, I always forget) dictates that &quot;
no one individual shall posses more that two &quot;rare&quot; vintage Volkswagens&quot;.
I count one Hearse and one limo bug (very rare!)...so sorry, you're over
your limit sir.  Better luck next time ;-).
