Subject: difficult engine removal

Hey Volks,

I'm in a struggle of wills it seems, or more likely my own ignorance.
I've purchased my first Split window '67, and the engine is proving
extremely stubborn in coming out of the bay!  Bottom 27 mm bolts are
removed, starter nut is out and and upper left nut never present.  But
the bus refuses to let go of her heart into my care.

What recommendation would the great Vintage Guru's and mages grant me?
With their blessings will they then pray for us both.  This bus has a
long road of resurrection ahead of her, my inexperience and lack of
resources mechanical and financial ensures this sad fact.
