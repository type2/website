Don't know about over there, but here Campers with fixed interiors are
classed as Motor homes, and hence passenger related, as opposed to other
vans or trucks which are meant to carry cargo.

Here, at least, the compulsory personal insurance is less for passenger
vehicles than commercials, so it was worth it to get the registration
changed to motorhome for me.

FWIW,

 Another thing I've noticed is that alot of buses with og black or og yellow
plates have &quot;commercial&quot; truck plate number sequences.  My 63 EZ Camper has
normal &quot;passenger&quot; car black plates with the AAA 123 sequence.

I can understand Kombis and Deluxes being considered a pass. vehicle, but
the strange thing is my camper was originally a Panel.  Maybe the dealer
made the distinction when sending in the registration.  Mike Alcorn's
Sundial also has the pass. car black plate sequence.
