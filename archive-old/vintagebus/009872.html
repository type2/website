&gt; Hey, Erin's not perfect (he rarely answers my email to him), bit I'm damn

Yeah I must admit, when I get about 20 private emails in response to my
&quot;ho-hum&quot; posts and upwards of 30 plus on my &quot;prime time&quot; posts, it can get
really be taxing to try and reply to them all.  As it stands, there are
about 25 emails from the past 3 days that I need to reply to and bless Gene
Cornelius - he's got the most emails that need replying to and I have to
work through about 100 more emails before I get to his.  I hit the delete
button a lot but I do really aplogize to everyone who p-mails me and doesn't
get a reply.  It's really hard to keep up somtimes.

NQ
