Subject: Re: &lt;FMBC&gt; Busses On The River, August 17-19 THIS WEEKEND!

There are a few ex-Boy Scouts that will be a part of this juncture.  ...don't you feel much
better?

Seriously, and it's a good thing that you brought this up - I've forgot to mention it - 

YOU WILL BE RAFTING/WATERSPORTING AT YOUR OWN FREEWILL AND UNDER YOUR OWN SUPERVISION!  THERE ARE
NO RAFTING GUIDES OR OTHER PERSONS THAT ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR YOU AND YOU SAFETY.  THE SAFETY OF
EACH INDIVIDUAL IS LEFT UP TO THAT INDIVIDUAL. (this means you)  As always, ANYTHING YOU DO IS AT
YOUR OWN RISK!
