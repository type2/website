Hi all,

A while back I tore into the brakes and rear axle seals on my 1967 Westy to
fix both a bearing leak, and a rear wheel cylinder leak.  Ronnie fixed my
up with his German bearing seals and Mexican seal kits, I already had new
brake shoes from Wolfsburg West and my local Autozone (FLAPS) provided
actual German rear brake cylinders cheap!.  Ronnie went above and beyond
with advice, tips and support!  

Upon disassembly, as expected, everything was either grease covered or
filthy, so everything came apart to be cleaned and/or bead blasted and
painted or replaced.  The backing plates were stripped, primed and painted.
 The return springs and other brake hardware were all in nice condition,
cleaned up set aside.  I had to replace the driver side outer &quot;roller&quot;
style wheel bearing on the stub axle.  What a bitch that was to pull, even
with a factory VW #241A bearing puller!  Does anyone know if they made a
different factory axle bearing puller for the newer roller bearings vs. the
older style ball bearings?  I have the correct VW Factory shop manuals and
VW Parts book and the Muir Book for my Bus.  I'm now about to re-assemble
all these spiffy, clean parts.  But before I do, I have a few quick
questions.

1.      The Workshop manual says to renew both paper seals (the one between
the red. box housing and the brake backing plate as well as the one between
the backing plate and the bearing cover.  They mention nothing about using
sealant.  Should I use something like the brush-on liquid &quot;Permatex
Form-a-gasket sealant&quot; or &quot;Gasketsinch&quot; sealant on both sides of each
gasket, or put the gaskets in dry?  Knowledgeable opinions?

2.      When re-installing red. box drain (I used &quot;magnetic&quot;) plugs, after
cleaning the threads very thoroughly, should a dab of the above mentioned
sealant be used or not used on the threads before installing to help
prevent leaks?  Anyone know of a torque spec for these plugs?  I didn't see
one.  I know not to over tighten them.  And yes I have been, and will be
using GL-4 tranny gear oil. 

3.      The Workshop manual says to use a little &quot;hi-melting point graphite
grease&quot; on the brake adjusting stars for lubrication when re-assembling
them in their housing.  What is a modern-day brand and descriptive name for
this grease?  If it's unusual stuff, where do you get it?

4.      Am I correct in assuming that the only parts used out of the
generic rear axle seal kits when used on a 1964-'67 &quot;big nut&quot; Bus tranny
are the two paper gaskets, the smaller &quot;O&quot; ring, the cotter pin and the
axle grease seal (I used Ronnie's German seal instead of the one included
in the kit).  The larger &quot;O&quot; ring and the large flat, thin washer included
in the kit can be saved or discarded. Does that sound correct?

5.       Finally, do any of you experts out there have any wonderful tips
to share concerning these procedures (bearing seal replacement and rear
brake replacement)?

Thanks for your input!
