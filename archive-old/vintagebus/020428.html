Speaking of tools, I found a really nice 32mm wrench on sale at
http://www.nashbar_dot_com. Its made for bicycle headsets and is about two
quarters (the coin) thick, but I bought it for the front inner axle nut
on my busses.(won't fit later busses, not sure what year they changed) It
works perfectly and is excellant quality, and is on sale for $9.94, can't
beat that.It even has a nice rubber coated handle. I thought about buying
them up and then e-barfing em out for more $ as vw tools :) Anyway if
anyone's interested their number is 1 800 nashbar and the tool is a
Pedro's headset wrench PE-HSW-32 .I'm not afilliated with them, just a
satisfied customer.
