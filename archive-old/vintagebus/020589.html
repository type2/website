If you are going custom then Rikki James
&lt;rikki.james_at_random.co_dot_uk&gt; appears to be doing it
right. See VWPlanet deluxe gallery. 

Even for an accused vintage nazi like myself, I like
the looks of this bus- so far. Practical? Done right?
-Pfft who cares. Carry-on Rikki!

Natural patina-ready for handcan clearcoat, dumped on
the ground, fitted with a huge Porsche engine and
looking old school at the same time. As long as the
MOT doesn't care then I'd say to carry-on. Easier and
more fun than going bone stock for sure!
Question is regarding the four bolt wheels. FOUR
bolts? Give us a few detail shots of the suspension to
break the mystery.
Too bad that there was no way to avoid carving up the
pressed ribbed bumper...

Air conditioning? Gas heater? Entertainment systems?
Air bags? Neon tubes under the rocker panels? 

Devon kit inside with grafted Dormobile top?~ naw...

Thanks to Rikki for sharing the &quot;snaps&quot; (photos).

Opinions? ~bus snob? John Jones?
