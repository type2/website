That is certainly what it is for, but it will only work if you have the
preheater hose hooked up to suck the warm air from under the cylinders on #3
&amp; 4. Pretty unusual to see that hooked up correctly anymore. The flap closes
the end of the snorkel and forces the air to come from the preheat
stove-little-metal-chingas that lives under the rear tin. Only at idle, as
you noted it opens above that.

&gt; Hi, you hit it on the nose....it is a cold weather pre
&gt; heat thingy....helps in the cold weather not the
&gt; hot

 &gt; &quot;The weighted flap in the air cleaner intake pipe
&gt; &gt; must be free to move in
&gt; &gt; the winter and the cool seasons. If the average
&gt; &gt; temperature is above 50° F
&gt; &gt; (10° C), the flap should be fixed open by jamming
&gt; &gt; the lever under the ridge
&gt; &gt; on the intake pipe.&quot;
