Subject: [VB] 80 over bearings? why bother?
Message-ID: &lt;19991225234751.7788.qmail_at_web1205.mail.yahoo_dot_com&gt;

80 over and marginally pounded thrust begs for leaving
the bearings out and running it at the next events
&quot;engine blow&quot; contest! Why not just (figuratively
speaking) burn the case at the next Jerome and search
for a better used or a mondo expensive new case?
I can hear the reply that &quot;yeah, VanBondo, not
everyone can afford new cases!&quot; Trust me, I know what
you mean.
My thought is that it would be cheaper than building
an engine twice... The second time being after the
cheap-out motor takes a poop in heavy traffic in bad
weather.

Is it common that folks now-a-days are thinking
nothing of 80 out cases?

&lt;Please *DONT* burn cases at Jerome!&gt;
