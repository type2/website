&lt;&lt; I'm ready to take mine apart since I have no idea what it went through but 
have a dilemma. What parts should I replace to make sure it works OK?&gt;&gt;
Hi Andre,
Best to get and read the repair manuals like the Idiot's manual, Bentley 
manual for your year engine, and How to Hot Rod Your VW Engine.  Then you can 
begine to ask specific questions and get better ansewers.

&lt;&lt;What improvements should I make?&gt;&gt;
It all depends on what yu want from it.  High HP or longevity and good MPG?

&lt;&lt; It's a dual port and I have a Solex 34 PICT-3 carb. Is it a trust worthy 
one? Should I be looking at something else?  &gt;&gt;
Stock dual port heads have a habit of cracking around the valve to spark plug 
area.  If you stay with DP you really should consider installing some 
aftermarket CB041(?) DP heads that have the thicker casting to prevent this.  
Personally we hate the two extra rubber seals on the intake manifold that can 
leak and burn up a head on that side.  Also hate the way the DP manifolds 
take up more room and make it harder to change spark plugs.  The carb is a 
good one though a bit more tricky you can set it better than you can with 
earlier carbs.   Eric&amp;Barb
