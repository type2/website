About spark plug heat ranges:

The heat range is determined by the length of the path that heat must
travel from the tip of the plug, through the ceramic to the metal plug
body.  A &quot;hot&quot; plug has a long path, so the tip is better insulated
and will run hotter.  A &quot;cold&quot; plug has a shorter path, so the heat
from the tip will have an easier time finding its way to the head.


How does a hot plug cause pre-ignition?

Pre-ignition is caused by a &quot;hot spot&quot; in the combustion chamber
causing the ignition of the mixture before the spark occurs.  The hot
spot could be a carbon deposit, a thin metal edge, or the tip of a
too-hot spark plug.  Any of these could cause the mixture to ignite
prematurely.

OTOH, a plug that is too cold will tend to pick up carbon deposits,
which can cause fouling and (guess what!) preignition.

The trick is to pick a heat range that is a happy medium between
fouling and preignition.
