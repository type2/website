Why use brass, a soft material hardly notable for it's wear characteristics?

Why not use bronze bushings, typically alloyed and engineered for just this
type of application?

If you're going to all the trouble to machine and re-bush, why use a bushing
material doomed to an early failure?

&gt;&gt; We do them in-house and machine the cases and output shafts for new brass
bushings. &lt;&lt;
