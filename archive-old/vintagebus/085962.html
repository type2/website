Subject: Re: [VB] A New Engine.

I recall a 60 Westy with a 1.9 TDI in it on the Samba. Might search that  and 
see if you can contact the guy who did it or had it done. It can be done.  
The difficult problem is going to be not modifing the body. I have a friend that 
 did a water cooled GTI motor in a bay window. The only thing that you see 
that  is different is the rear engine lid. He louvered that. 
Good luck.
