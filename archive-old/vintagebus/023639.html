Subject: NOS 12 volt gas heater-under parcel tray
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

Hi folks, If anyone is in the market for a very hard to find Stewart Warner 
Southwind model 8335 12 volt gas heater, just go to ebay and type in VW gas 
heater and you will find it. This heater is NOS, never been installed. It has 
everything and I mean everything necessary for installation in the under the 
parcel tray position on a 67 and earlier bus.  I even have the original 
operating instructions, copies of wiring diagrams and a &quot;template&quot; for where 
to cut the holes for the exhaust and intake. There is a pic, so you can see 
what all you are getting. I am selling my bus unfortunately that I was going 
to install it in, so its up for grabs. Thanks. 

Jim Morse
