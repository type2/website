Well, let's see here....

I cut up and sold a roof clip from a 21 window last year.  I know of a few people
with 21 window roof clips lying around, and there are several others in a junkyard
a few hours from here.

As for buying a deluxe, there are plenty of running and driving deluxes out
there for under 5G's.  The VW hobby sun does not rise and set in Kalifornia
ya know. Look  through the NEATO newsletter, online classified of papers around
the country etc. 

And take a chill-pill and call me in the morning!  ;-)

&gt;&quot;_Just_ find a 64-67 roof&quot;?  How many 21 window roof clips do you guys see

&gt;for sale a year?  I can think of 2 in the last 3 yrs and I'm sitting in
&gt;sunny CA.  As far as the rear hatch question, someone had suggested (on the

&gt;list) &quot;grafting&quot; the skylights and sunroof into the existing roof rather
&gt;than replacing the whole thing.  The last 23 window I saw for sale that was

&gt;running was $10g's.  The last 23 window I saw that was not running and rusty

&gt;went for $5g's.  &quot;just go buy a deluxe&quot;? ;o)
