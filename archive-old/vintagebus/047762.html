Hi Everyone,
   Yesterday I spend a chilly Nov Northern Ill day in my UNHEATED garage 
going over my 57 singlecab with a friend who is going to do a little welding 
for me, and we were discussing what to do with the bed. Either spending time 
to straighten it out, or to just replace it with new metal. I have seen 
various suppliers of sections (but no full pieces), I'm sure someone on the 
list has had this same dilemma and I hope to benefit from their experience. 
Any help will be appreciated. Also would anyone happen to have a correct set 
of early tail lights, engine lid, and crank hole apron laying around and need 
some Xmas $$$$.
                                                                       Steve
