Subject: RE: [VB] Strangest injuries -- scars

I think scarring is cool (partly because I have so many scars thanks to
German iron).

The scars remind me of the different cars I have owned.  I can like at the
one on my right little finger and reminisce about the time I was removing a
rusty rocker from my '60 deluxe ;-).

I was prying the return spring onto the arm of the throwout bearing shaft
with a
screwdriver........ the screwdriver slipped and put a gash just above my
lip. One trip to the emergency room and two stitches later I was back in the
garage. Could have been worse, i.e.. eye injury etc.

Mechanics Tip.... Vitamin E oil reduces/eliminates scarring!!!
