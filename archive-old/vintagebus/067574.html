Hi George,
The bus steering wheel shaft except for veeery early Barndoor buses are 
tapered fitted and a single woodruff key instead of splines.  So there is not 
way to adjust just the steering wheel to the shaft it mounts on in 1953ish 
thru 1967 buses.  We thinks George has been playing with too many type 1s 
which always have had splined steering wheel shafts!  ;-)
