&gt; I've taken apart my front wheels to install new
&gt; wheel cylinders, and clean things up. and after
&gt; looking at the rusty mess I'm thinking I should take
&gt; the drums and backing plates in to get them professionally
&gt; sanded. there's a place in town that does &quot;shot peening&quot;
&gt; for 80.00 an hour; is this appropriate for this type of 
&gt; application or would you guys and gals recommend a different
&gt; approach? 
&gt; 

Shot peening is a strengthening procedure, not a cleaning procedure.
The part is blasted with small metal shot to distort the surface,
the theory beeing that cracks will less likely propogate in
an irregular surface than a regular one.

What you want is &quot;bead blasting&quot;
