&gt; &lt;&lt; why is a breaker bar not working? how big is the bar?
&gt;  do you have the engine on a bench?
&gt;  do you have air compressor and an impact gun?
&gt;  are locking it up so the engine doesnt turn?
&gt;  i usually just hit hit it with the gun and it comes right off

&gt; I have seen a torque meister in use and it is impressive but I dont have one. 
&gt;  
&gt; I do have a 36mm 1/2&quot; drive socket and a 1/2&quot; slide bar and a 6 foot pipe.   
&gt; and a flywheel lock.

OK, there's the problem.  36mm is way too large a socket for 1/2 inch
drive.  3/4 is better.

I'd never use a flywheel lock.  The engine isn't all that stable and why
risk breaking the case by applying such an offset load?  Get a 5-foot
length of stiff angle or channel iron.  Drill two holes to match clutch
bolts located not quite opposite each other, but not adjacent to each
other either.  Bolt channel to flywheel, use good wrench with cheater,
rest channel on ground, apply weight to bar, gland nut breaks loose!
