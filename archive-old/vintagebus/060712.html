Hi Clara,
All 1500cc air cleaners had brackets on the right ceiling of the engine 
compartment.  The 1200cc engine had the air cleaner on the left on a bracket 
mounted between the coil and shroud.

&gt; If the bracket is on the roof on the right, it came with the 1500 air 
&gt; cleaner with the breather spout on the left of the oil bath.  at the time 
&gt; most were on the left, buses that came with eberspachers had them on the 
&gt; right

Unless you have a 1200cc engine with oversized aircleaner and often a cyclone 
filter attached or the later 1500cc oversized air cleaner that came without 
cyclone.  Both of these could be special ordered to come with the bus from 
the factory!  Check your 1963-67 bus shop manual for pictures and more info.
Also if you had a 1200cc engine with standard air cleaner and it came with 
Eberspacher or you had the VW dealer install one the air cleaner was shifted 
to the right with a special Eberspacher bracket to allow enough room for the 
gas heater on the right of the engine.  Of course VW outfitted with Denzel, 
Okrasa and other makes of modified engines having dual carbs would have 
completely differant air cleaners!
