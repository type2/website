Subject: DynoSoar type1 aluminum engine case
Cc: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

Hi folks,

I found the following ad in the Volkswagen Archive classifieds
(http://www.oea.se/pk/tvwa/).  I've seen dry sump and aftermarket cases
offered by Pauter for racing, but it appears from this ad that this DynoSoar
case is an improved version of the type1 case in aluminum and accepts  &quot;the
factory VW accessories&quot; [wonder if that means everything?] and is offered
with an 85.5mm bore.  Is anyone familiar with the original Dynosoar case
features or this newer version?  Even at the dealer price, it's still about
the cost of three new Brazilian, magnesium cases--but intriguing enough to
consider if it truly is an aluminum replacement for the type 1 case!  

--Ron
