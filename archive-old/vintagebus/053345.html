&lt;&lt; fwiw, the oil pressure w/ the grooved piston seems to be behaving like it

Hi Craig,
Muir was a great guy we wish we could have met!  But alot of things like 
running an engine without thermostatic flaps or that the glowing red gen 
idiot light and many other statments in the Idiot Manual are incorrect.  
   The below from the 1965 Workshop Manual Volkswagen 1200.
Note: 
All twin carburetor engines are fitted with the modified pressure relief 
valve piston with annualar groove (311 115 411).  This piston can be 
subsequently installed in all engines (except the 30 bhp type) which are used 
mainly in countries with hot climates.

All this measure lowers the engine oil temperature ovr the entire range, the 
modified piston must not be installed in countries with temperate or cold 
climates.

&lt;&lt; any tips on how to determine if the system is working 'correctly?'  &gt;&gt;

Buy an oil temp and pressure gauges.  Install them and monitor the reading 
and check to make sure they stay between 160-210F and 10-50 PSI when the 
engine is warmed up.  Oil pressure over 80 PSI at any time will not only risk 
oil cooler blow out, but possible distortion of the cooler in such a way as 
to constrict or even block the cooling air from going through the cooler!
