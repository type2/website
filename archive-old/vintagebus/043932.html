Plan on checking out a '65 Camper tomorrow.
It has a small pop top but it is hinged on one side - vs - popping
straight up.
It is not a walk thru.
It has the nuts mounted behind the outer skin where once resided an oval
(Euro ?) license plate.
It is 100% original and to date, untouched.
Any ideas from the think tank on what it is?
Not a big deal, in that I'll get all the skinny when I check it out
tomorrow.
Asking price is $4K and it's a driver.  Some new paint and the Bus would
be lookin/driving fine.
Thanks for any info
later
