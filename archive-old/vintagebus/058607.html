I think it is a Dodge or Ford.  I saw one of them (most likely a promo car)
at a interiror shop getting some work done. The paint was done up with the
&quot;mystery machine&quot; on the side.  I assume they'll drive to the premier in it
or something like that.

Any of you SoCal, Hollywood insider type bus folks have the scoop as to if
the &quot;Mystery Machine&quot; in the new Scooby Doo movie is a VW or not?  You can
only see a partial shot of the cargo door in the commercial.  Looks like it
might be.  I'll have to take my boys to go see iteither way but if there is
a VW in it at least I would have something to look forward too.
