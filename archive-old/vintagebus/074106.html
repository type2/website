Subject: Re: [T2] Re: [VB] 65' brake system question

Hi Volks,

I agree with Jason's advice, and would add that at this point a brake 
fluid change is also in order.

When I brought home my 79 westfakia body the brake fluid was black. I 
didn't worry about it at the time because the brakes worked fine, and I 
had lots of other things to take care of. But it wasn't long after that 
the bus suddenly needed a new master cylinder and 2 rear wheel 
cylinders; money I could have saved if I'd spent a few $$ on fluid a 
few months sooner.

YMMV.

Happy trails,

&gt; well like you said, could be the master cyl, a wheel cyl, even busted

&gt; I suppose you could check the fluid level &amp; then just pump the pedal a
&gt; lot &amp; see if the level goes down (would indicate a leak) or if the
&gt; system just never creates pressure to begin with (indicate a master
&gt; cyl problem). I personally wouldn't drive it any untill I found the
&gt; cause of the lack of pressure, but I'm sure you agree with this.
