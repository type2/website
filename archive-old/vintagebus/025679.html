Hey Fred,

I'm not 100% sure, but I don't think this setup will work with the rear
hanger. You know how close that rear hanger is to the oil pump, and the
filter (yes, it's one of those spin on filters and it screws onto the
side of the pump) would probably interfere with the hanger. I'm not even
sure if you can use it with a stock german exhaust system.

I've got a cheap header on my bus now, and it looks like I have plenty
of room for it. As soon as I get it (and my digital camera from my
ex-girlfriend), I'll lay it out on the floor and take pictures of it and
make them available to anyone interested...
