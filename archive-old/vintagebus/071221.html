Subject: flames

Hi All,

 

For my double cabs birthday (may 19), I took the spring plates down to
my paint guy for a few flames. we also put some subtle flames on the
steering column tube (as per RichardB's suggestion for at least some
flames in the interior).  I posted a few pics up on Vintagebus_dot_com and
updated two of my own web pages.  

 

VN's need not respond unless you have that data on the 5D vs 8G 6x10mm
kamax bolt question I posted earlier ;-)

 

 

 

David
