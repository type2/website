Subject: Re: Roof Racks and Wind

I have a piece of wood on the rack on Bessie-- Best thing I ever did--What a
great observation deck!! works great at the VW Shows--or just going to some
event where you need some clearance to see what is happening.--I have
received a TON of calls on the full rack I have for sale==But a Lot of them
are out of state--How do you ship
an 8' x 4' x 1' Roof Rack at a reasonable cost? It's even too big for
Greyhound--
