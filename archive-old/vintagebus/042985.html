You also might check the concentricity of the brake drums. Both of the
front drums on my 64 were far off when I got it back in 96. It would shake
at low speeds as the wheels physically were off center about 1/4 inch -
you could see it when you rotated them by hand when lifted. When they were
in synch with each other the whole car vibrated at certain speeds. I
replaced them with new ones from my VWFLAP, and the problems were
gone.
The problem was that the threaded holes for the lug nuts were all off
center together. Apparently fairly common in some drums aftermarket.
