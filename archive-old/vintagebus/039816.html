&gt; &gt; I was browsing through the Muir Idiot manual and found that he 
&gt;eliminated his electromagnetic cut-off jet.  Muir claims that VW sold a 
&gt;screw in jet to take its place.  Does anyone know what this PN# is or where 
&gt;to order one?


I wouldnt if i were you.
But if you want to it really is easy. A bit too easy. Take the device out. 
Take a pair of snips and cut the plunger off. Pull it out and cut it off. 
Thats it. Reinstall.
