Subject: [VB] metal inner panel

my bus came with a metal inner panel on the rear, passenger side of my bus,
above the storage area. i was wondering if anybody has come across this and
if so, what it's purpose is. i'm wondering if it's something Dormobile did,
or if it's just because it was originally a kombi. I took it out and
replaced it with a two-tone regular panel. someone (probably some hippy)
spray painted the metal panel bright yellow! but i'm wondering if it was put
in for maybe structural purposes (since there's a big hole in the roof), or
maybe even safety purposes (like a firewall of some sort). 

thanks!
