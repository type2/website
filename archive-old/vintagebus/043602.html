&gt;&gt;&gt; Then the rain came, six volt wipers in heavy rain, manually turning 
&gt;&gt;&gt; them on and off not to burn the motor out, for the next hundred miles
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; ...What I'm trying to say is
&gt;&gt; that a tail light wired in-line in the wiper motor hot lead might
&gt;&gt; be a good field expedient replacement for a volt-a-drop.  The
&gt;&gt; bulb will light up and get warm, though, so you will want to
&gt;&gt; put it where it won't glare on the windshield or ignite anything.
&gt;
&gt;Keep in mind that the resistance of lamp filiments varies greatly with
&gt;their temperature.  The resistance will be a lot less when the bulb is
&gt;cold (or half-on) so the wiper moter will see a lot more voltage.

This is true, but I believe the bulb will quickly heat up to its
normal resistance.  I found the following values on an 1157 12v
tail-light bulb:

filament  book spec         measured cold   measured hot
bright     6.1 ohms/26.9 W  0.5 ohms/328 W   6.07 ohms/29.1 W
dim       24.0 ohms/ 8.3 W  2.1 ohms/ 93 W  23.7  ohms/ 7.7 W

In other words, the cold resistance is approximately 1/12 of the 
hot resistance.  An 1154 6V tail-light bulb is specified at 
2.4/9.3 ohms, which gives an approximate cold resistance of
0.20/0.78 ohms.  Putting these in parallel yields a cold
resistance of about 0.16 ohms.

Given that the wiper motor is 6V, 20W, it will draw 3.3A on 6V
and about 6.6A on 12V.  When the motor is first switched on,
the bulb will drop about 6.6 * 0.16 or 1.1V.  However, it will
also dissipate about 6.9W.  This is greater than the design
wattage of the dim filament and a little under half the design
wattage of the bright filament.  I feel that this is enough
to quickly heat the bulb and increase the resistance of the
filaments.  When the bulb is operating at its design voltage,
it will draw 3.38A.  This is only a 2% increase over the
nominal current draw of the motor!  Or, if you assume that
the motor is operating at its design parameters of 6V 20W
3.3A, this is 97.6% of the design current draw of the bulb.
According to a chart in the Wagner miniature lamp catalog
I have, 96% of design voltage yields 97.2% of design current,
and 95% design V yields 97.2% design A.  I would conclude
that the bulb would drop around 95 to 95% of its nominal
voltage, or 6.08 to 6.14 V.
 
&gt;Better to use a real dropping resistor or a voltage regulator IC.

True.  Note the words &quot;field expedient&quot; in my message above.
Dropping resistors and 6V 4A voltage regulator ICs are not found
in every auto parts store; 6V tail-light bulbs and sockets to fit
them very often are.
