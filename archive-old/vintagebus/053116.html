Subject: RE: [VB] 71 brake master cylinder

&quot;When I mounted the new 71 24mm master cylinder the two original lines were
pointed right at the ports on the master cylinder, even with the adapter
plate, just like down town!&quot;

So did you use an adaptor plate and if so which one?

I could not figure out from the post if you did or did not :)

I think Bus Boys makes the adapter kit.


Thanks,
