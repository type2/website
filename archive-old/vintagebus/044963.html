&lt;&lt; Anyone know how to check the gearing to confirm I got what I paid for?) &gt;&gt;
Hi Adam,
First tach you old tranny before removal and then tach the new one to see the 
differance.  As to the R&amp;P you can easily tell by how many MPH you get with 
1,500 and 3,000 RPM in the three upper gears.  The only other way is to hand 
crank so many turns and see how many turns out you get from the one rear 
wheel you have jacked up.    Eric&amp;Barb
