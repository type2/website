Subject: `66 single cab spindle bearing seal question....

Hi folks. trying to save this rusty `66 but keep
hitting walls! Here is another problem yet! 

Ok...I have pulled the front spindles from the bus,
basically to disassemble and clean all brake hardware,
link pins and bearings....ect ect. 

Well upon close inspection of the bare spindles...I
notice the rasied machined area on the spindle where
the wheel bearing seal rides has some pretty severe
pitting due to rust. Closer inspections shows this was
casued by the use of the old style bearing seals that
are basically cotton seals....they had held enough
mositure over the years of the bus sitting in field to
cause heavy pitting on the sealing surface of the
spindle. 

Ok...this sealing surface is very very rough with
pits...and I would think would cause quick and severe
damaged to a brand new rubber style bearing seal. My
questions is what should I do? 

Here is some of my ideas 
-JB Weld the the pitted area and sand flush. There is
not heavy pressure of any kind placed on this sealing
area..just the spinning seal. Does anyone know if JB
weld is up to that amount of friction and heat of the
spinning seal though??? 
-use the old style felt-cotton bearing seal.....these
would be very very forgiving of the pits and friction
comapred to the new rubber style seals....would
probably work fine still with little leaking....OK
does anybody have a set of those old style seals or
know where i can buy some? I used to get them from the
local vw shop but have not tried again lately.... 

If anyone has a set of these old style felt seals or
some other parts I need below...please let me know!
 
WANTED
-Single cab gates....ANY condition...cheap and beat
prefered these are for a working beater truck.
-Early style felt front wheel bearing seals `64-`67
-pair of spindle bearing lock nuts...the ones that
have the thread going the 'wrong way' I think that
would be left hand threads...damn things where missing
from the bus!
-I need front wheel bearings and all brakes for the
bus...where is cheapest place to buy?

Thanks
