&lt;&lt; To bridge the gap from the end of the cable tube to the tube running 
through the fan shroud, the cable is exposed and it also is rubbing against 
the tranny.  It looks like it has been this way for some time, as the cable 
has sliced a nice groove into the
 tranny case.  Is there supposed to be any tube or flexible housing that runs 
from the end of the accelerator cable tube to the tube that runs through the 
fan shroud? &gt;&gt;
Hi Christen,
Up to Late JULY59 the type 1 &amp; 2 used a wire hanger that looks like a paper 
clip on steroids bolted to the upper left stud on the tranny where the nose 
cone mounts to the tranny housing.  AUG59 was the start of the use of a 
protective tube kind of like a boden tube, but much smaller diameter, part 
number 111 721 551.  The bus seems to have used the same part, but to be 
shortened to 670mm length.  To quickly fabricate the same you could use fuel 
line with the same or slightly larger inner diameter so it will slip onto the 
forward accelerator cable tubing on the body, and hose clamp on.   Eric&amp;Barb
