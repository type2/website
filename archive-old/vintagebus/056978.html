Subject: Re: [VB] Infrared Powder Coating?

It must be like that stuff they use for tooth fillings
now. It too is light activated.

&gt; Actually, no.  I was able to tour the Purolator

&gt; powdercoat oil filters, BUT,
&gt; after the powder is sprayed on, it goes through a
&gt; very short tunnel  with
&gt; special lights.  No heat, just light made it cure. 
&gt; He let us put our hand
&gt; in it, and there was no heat (I think the lights
&gt; were flourecent)  They
&gt; almost looked like black lights.  They were dry to
&gt; the touch when they came
&gt; out the tunnel too.  It was very neat.

&gt; &gt; Infrared is a fancy way to say &quot;heat radiation&quot;. 
&gt; I'd guess that he is
&gt; &gt; using a heat lamp or other source of heat
&gt; radiation to melt the powder
&gt; &gt; rather than putting it in an oven.
