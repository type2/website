Almost forgot. Although i couldn't get in touch with dawn of PLF to make an
appointment to come by and get my canopy, she shows up to the OCTO show with
my tilt canvas in her bus. kinda ironic how I live about 20 minutes away
from her but i have to go to california to pick it up :)
She did tell me business was goin well, and she told me the same, as another
list member already said : &quot;she had a check in her pocket for stephen.&quot;
well stephen, did you get it?

&gt;what a killer show. Found lots of kool items to drain my wallet.  A few of
&gt;the things I picked up were a &quot;light-up D plate&quot; from the Germans, and a
&gt;Swedish dealer VW flag. Also picked up 2 packages of NOS wiper arms (more
on
&gt;those in my future post entitled : &quot;what the hell year are these for?&quot; or
as
&gt;the Arizonans say &quot; what the hell are these FOR&quot; ;)
&gt;Everett was there pimpin his goodies and I saw Thom's yellow
&gt;submarine,although I never saw Thom. I was gonna jump on the &quot;give Thom
&gt;royalties for showing up to a VW show&quot; bandwagon, and give him a NOS hazet
&gt;tool kit, but alas, I never saw him. maybe next time :)
&gt;I threw up a picture of the kool firetruck display with optional mannequins
&gt;and a fire trailer, as well as a seafoam green and white 21 deluxe I saw
&gt;when I was crusin back to AZ on the freeway. G/F was bored and had 1 pic
&gt;left in the camera.  A long distance listee driver perhaps?  If so, hes got
&gt;ballz cause I didn't see a license plate...
&gt;heres the link
&gt;http://www.angelfire_dot_com/az2/wade/octo.html
&gt;I can throw up more pics if anyone wants, but im sure everett will have the
&gt;full deal on his site anyways.
