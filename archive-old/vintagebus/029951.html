&gt; Hi All,
&gt;  First off... hope everyone had a safe &amp; happy Turkey Day:)
&gt; Now for the q's:) I got a 2000cc engine with a 215mm flywheel that were
&gt; going to &quot;try&quot; to put in a T1 IRS trans. If anyone has the
&gt; info/tips/part numbers for this conversion, please pmail me.
&gt;  Thanks,

You want to use a 210mm flywheel with a hole machined in it to fit the pilot
bearing.  That gives the trans shaft something to ride on.  The 215mm can be
made to fit, but you have to hog out a LOT of metal and it is generally not a
recommended way to go.
