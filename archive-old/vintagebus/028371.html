&gt; Hi,
&gt;
&gt; Anyone know if there are any rules or regs about driving
&gt; down the freeway in CA without a windshield? Mine is out and
&gt; I thought I would don some safety goggles and drive on down
&gt; anyway.

Sorry Chris,
You'll be trolling for a ticket

CALIFORNIA CODES
VEHICLE CODE
SECTION 26700-26712


26700.  (a) Except as provided in subdivision (b), a passenger
vehicle, other than a motorcycle, and every bus, motortruck or truck
tractor, and every firetruck, fire engine or other fire apparatus,
whether publicly or privately owned, shall be equipped with an
adequate windshield.
   (b) Subdivision (a) does not apply to any vehicle issued
identification plates pursuant to Section 5004 which was not required
to be equipped with a windshield at the time it was first sold or
registered under the laws of this state, another state, or foreign
jurisdiction.

36515.  The provisions of Section 26700 relating to windshields
shall not apply to implements of husbandry.

So unless you can PROVE that your bus qualifies as an &quot;implement of
husbandry&quot; (farm vehicle), you are out of luck.

Scott
