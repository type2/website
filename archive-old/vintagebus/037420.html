I've been kicking the idea for sound deading and insulating my 66, I know the
bagged insulation idea will cause trouble, the plastic will hold condensation
and sweat moisture. But there are foam sheet's that might work. I know from my
windsurfing and surfing there are a couple of types of foam closed cell and
urethane (coolers and 
surfboards) surfboard foam soaks up water like a sponge but is easy to sand.
Closed cell foam won't water log but is a bitch to shape. I think that in thin
enough sheet it might work.
