Subject: Late engine in '65, install problems

I'm almost embarrassed to post this.  I should have paid more attention
earlier...

Run down is that I have a '65 Crew that I bought a month back when Rex was
in town... and Rex will ultimately be the owner of this crew (not to be
confused with my '63 crew).  My newness to splits is showing...  Story is
that the owner drove it into my garage, we pulled engine, drove his engine
home and it has been sitting for a month.  Well, I want to move it off site
for storage so I can use the garage for my '63 crew.

I have a bug engine, later type with doghouse oil cooler... 12Volt with
alternator.

Bus is 12v converted, but I'm not using an engine that has ever been in it.
I never bothered to check into the engine when the PO took it away... I
don't know if it had 200mm flywheel or not.  It is stock '65 swing axle
tranny with redux boxes...

Here are my symptoms:
  1) Ok, got the engine in, but it seemed a real tight fit.  I took my time
and alternated turning bottom two 17mm nuts to get it all in.  Installed the
17mm up the starter bolt.
  2) Clutch pedal is completely limp .. obvious sign that TOB and clutch
aren't working out right.  Wing-nut was almost at end, moved it in 8 good
turns, still limp pedal.
  3) Can't turn the pulley with the nuts tightened down.
  4) Put it into gear (best I could) and I roll forward and it is almost
like the clutch is engaged... engine isn't turning and no resistance.
  5) Ok, I hooked up a 12V battery and check all electrical -- good, but
turning on starter yields nothing (no noise, no nothing.)

Obviously I have a problem.  How do I tell if the flywheel is NOT enlarged
for 200mm?

Did I use a incompatible clutch?  I used this clutch:
http://www.i405_dot_com/vw/stand/clutch1.jpg  (Although not that dirty engine!).
Is this not compatible with a swing-axle tranny?

Any help appreciated, I have to replace my starter in the '63 as soon as I
get this '65 out of the garage, so the lessons about splits are being
learned...
