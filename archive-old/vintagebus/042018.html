&gt; The &quot;left coast&quot; on North America is hardly a barometer for dealers
&gt; nationwide and to make such an assumption is stretch of logic worthy of
&gt; Al Gore....

Well, like it or not, California seems to be the nation's leader, good or
bad.  Look at the folks who said &quot;We'll never have smog inspections like
they have in California.&quot;  How many states smog inspect now? 
 
&gt; &gt; &gt; As far as inspections go, for the most part here in NC, they are somewhat
&gt; &gt; &gt; of a farce. We regularly see cars that are in nowhere near &quot;passing&quot;
&gt; &gt; &gt; condition, with new stickers on them. I believe that if they are
&gt; &gt; &gt; properly done, they can be a benefit,
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Why?  What makes the inspector more knowledgeable about my vehicle than I
&gt; &gt; am?  Why should I have pay someone else every year or two to prove that I
&gt; &gt; am innocent of driving an illegal vehicle?
&gt; 
&gt; Simple, I share the road with you and a lot of other vehicles: You may be
 competent in maintaining your vehicle, but others are not.

Fine.  The cops can pull them over and cite them if they have reasonable
cause to do so.  One very nice thing about our system of law is that the
government has the responsibility to prove violators guilty of crimes.  We
should not have to prove ourselves innocent on a yearly basis.

&gt; If you have spent the time I have in a professional repair situation you
&gt; would see that the majority of folks don't do preventative maintenance,
&gt; adopting, rather, a &quot;wait 'til it breaks&quot; mentality. Inspections are
&gt;more than pollution checks in most states, they are checks of the safety
of the car in general.

And your inspection is going to guarantee that the car is safe to drive
until the next inspection?  I think not.  By necessity you'll approve
brake pads that will be worn out long before another year passes.  If
they're within wear limits, you'll have to pass them.  Tires
with 3/32 of tread depth will pass your inspection and be &quot;unsafe&quot; 5000
miles later.

Also, what about the damage done by the &quot;inspector&quot; during the course of
the inspection?  What about the stripped or broken wheel studs caused by
some idiot forgetting to switch his air wrench from &quot;semitruck&quot; to &quot;VW&quot;?
The number of mechanics qualified and willing to work on our buses is
dwindling, and to be forced to take my bus to some unqualified mechanic to
meet a legal requirement is abhorrant.

&gt; I personally do not want some halfwit with no brakes or
&gt; slick tires, or a separated tie rod end, taking out either me or my
&gt; family.... perhaps you do not have such cares about yourself or
&gt; your loved ones, but I do.

Ah yes, I don't want to give up my right to own and operate a
vehicle without submitting it to your inspection so I must be neglegent
of my children.  Actually, I care about them very much and want them to be
able to live their lives without having to answer to self-appointed safety
experts.

Sorry, but your arguement doesn't wash.  It has never been shown that
inspection programs reduce accident rates in any way.  If they did, you
can bet your bottom dollar that the news would be sung from the rooftops
by the governmment and the inspection industry.

&gt; &gt; So, it seems that if you were allowed to charge $50 for an inspection you
&gt; &gt; would be all for them.  Your only objection seems to be that you aren't
&gt; &gt; allowed to charge enough for them.
&gt; 
&gt; Again, you miss the point. Here the charge of $8.25, mandated by the
&gt; state to do a half hour inspection was set in the '70s, when $2.65
&gt; was a reasonable hourly rate. We employ only certified technicians and
&gt; invest a lot of money in their education. Most of our techs are college
&gt; educated and have combined training comparable to that of other
&gt; &quot;professionals&quot; - doctors, lawyers, PhDs etc. What do you do? Is your
&gt; time not valuable in the market place? If not, come on over,  my house
&gt; needs painting.....I may be able to afford you.

Perhaps you should be required to have a &quot;Certified Painter&quot; come
into your house, who would
inspect the paint for peeling, lead compounds, suitable psychological
color schemes, etc.  Of course the painter would have to attend 
a number of courses to qualify for certification and this
would be expensive.  Still, it shouldn't cost more than $50 a year and,
it's for safety!  What?  You say that you can do that yourself?  What
about your lazy neighbors, where your children visit?  They might have
some peeling lead paint about.  Don't you care about your children?

Absurd?  Yes.  Just as absurd as the concept that anyone should be
forced to use the services of a vehicle inspector.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Just my two cents, but it is too easy to vilify automotive professionals,
&gt; &gt;  when most of us are collectors ourselves and we are on the same side.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Well, when they're pushing laws that are hazardous to my enjoyment of my
&gt; &gt; vehicle it is very easy.  Why should I have to make an unneeded trip, let
&gt; &gt; a stranger fiddle with, and possibly damage, my bus, and pay them to tell
&gt; &gt; me something I already
&gt; &gt; know just to line the pockets of the &quot;inspector&quot;?
&gt; 
&gt; Again, your short sightedness is pitiful. The majority of car enthusiasts
&gt; and professionals are against the laws.

Enthusiasts are certainly against inspections.  Professionals, including
you, are definitely for them as long as they can profit from them.  You
stated this clearly above.

&gt; It is corporate America and
their pollution generating factories that are behind it. I can start an
&gt; organization and call it anything that I want to. Look at who is funding
&gt;this organization that you cite as evidence of some conspiracy.

Well, Galpin Ford is one member of the association that I recall.  The
others seemed to be well-known California dealers.  No big corporations
were mentioned, although I'm sure that the auto makers happy to support
the organization.

 Again,&gt; 
&gt;you may be the exception in checking the condition of your car, but you
&gt; are hardly the rule. Ever been almost taken out by some airhead soccer
&gt;mom in a behemoth SUV (sorry soccer moms, but you know to whom I
refer)... you think she is thinking that her brakes need checking? Not&gt; 
unless there is a noise..... then it is too late. Braking performance is&gt; 
already compromised. 

As I said above, you can only guarantee the safety of a vehicle as it
leaves your shop.  Inspections would have little effect on the scenario
you cite.  Sure you might tell her that her linings were getting a bit
thin, but how long will that knowledge remain in that &quot;airhead&quot; you cite?
Three months later she'll respond to the sound of metal-on-metal, just as
in a non-inspection state.

&gt;In addition, there is no lining of the pockets of&gt; 
&gt;anyone in the inspection biz.... the state is pushing for emissions&gt; 
&gt;checking here in our county. How many inspections would it take at even&gt; 
&gt;$20 to pay for a $65,000 machine that meets the states &quot;requirements?&quot;!
&gt;  No profit margin there, my friend.....

There are hundreds of businesses here that do nothing but inspections.  In
fact they advertise themselves as &quot;inspection only&quot; on the premise that
they won't &quot;make work&quot; for themselves as many &quot;inspection and repair&quot;
garages do.  They pay big bucks for machines, but they have a captive
audience that is forced to use their services every two years.  They don't
seem to be going bankrupt at all.

&gt; Again, if you will read with comprehension, I am no fan of the
&gt; inspection process as it stands, either.

I comprehend you well.  Your message is clear.  You can't do a proper
inspection for $9.  You want the fee cap lifted so that you can do a
proper inspection for more money.

&gt; As I said, if they are done
&gt;*properly* they can be a benefit in letting certain elements of our
&gt; population know they are an &quot;accident waiting to happen.&quot;  If you
&gt; don't think people are oblivious, how many old Volvos or Toyotas
&gt; have you ever seen tooling down the road belching so much smoke
&gt; you could barely make out the &quot;Love Your Mother&quot; or &quot;Greenpeace&quot;
&gt; stickers on the back.

Very few.  The smokers tend to be pulled over and cited rather rapidly.
This is as it should be.  If your vehicle is unsafe, you should be cited
for it.  If you cause an accident because of an unsafe vehicle you should
be held accountable for your neglegence.  However, you should not be
forced to prove your own innocence at _any_ time.

Inspection supporters conjure up visions of wild-eyed idiots
driving about in vehicles with bald tires and non-operative hydraulic
braking systems zipping down the streets at 80MPH in the rain.  They tell
us that this scenario will become fact unless we pay them to certify our
cars as being safe.

The fact is that this scenario occurs very seldom anywhere, regardless of 
the inspection program in place.  The only thing the inspection supporters
are selling is fear.  Anyone who would drive a grossly unsafe vehicle
isn't going to care about inspections anyway.

This is my last post on this topic.
