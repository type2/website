&gt;Hey, what's this &quot;1967 hump back tank&quot;??  I ran out of gas in my '66 once
&gt;in less than 200 miles.  The stock tank is way too small.  Is the '67 tank
&gt;bigger?

Bigger physically? yes

Bigger as in more gas holding capacity? no

I have 1964, 1965, 1966 &amp; 1967 owners manuals and they all state the 
gas tanks hold 10.6 gallons.  The later 67 tanks (they did not start with 
the 67 model year) have a hump in the top rear that is only seviceable as 
a vapor expansion area.  They can't hold more gasoline, due to the fact 
that air gets trapped there.
