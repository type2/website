Subject: Re: [VB] Noisy TO bearing saga continues

Hi Joe


I too continue to strugle with a very noisy, grinding, clutch.  Push down on
the clutch pedal and I start to get a grinding noise.   Gets worse the
further you push the pedal. Also increases with the clutch pedal in and
increased engine revs.    I replaced the cross shaft, along with the PP, TO
bearing and disc.  Only thing I did not do was the Gland nut, and I am going
to do it tomorrow.  I tried both a Brazil pp from Ronnie and a German 3
finger.

I don't know what to do if this does not work...

&gt; Well, I've about decided that checking/replacing the cross-shaft and
bushings is about the only thing I haven't tried.  My assumption was that a
&gt; Rancho rebuilt tranny would have had all that stuff checked out - but
maybe not.
&gt;
&gt; IF I can figure out how to get the right-hand cross-shaft bush out I'll
replace the whole schmeer.  CB Performace sells a new HD cross shaft &amp;
bushes
&gt; for about $14.
&gt;
&gt; It's SO freakin' annoying to get this nasty noise every time I use the
clutch.  More annoying since this will be engine pull #3 to try to resolve
it.
