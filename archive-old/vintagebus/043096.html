For those of you that are very interested in original VW part numbers and
the schematics used to locate/identify the correct parts for your busses
based on chassis numbers....I have a couple of copies left over of the
parts reference manuals that dealers used.  About 750 pages of info, and
printed in July of '67.  Covers the '58 to '67 Busses.
If interested let me know.
There have been some others who had shown interest but who have not
actually bought what I have left over.  
First come first served.
There are quite a few other listees who have bought these and I'm sure
that if you were to ask them for their opinion of the manuals they would
be willing to reply with some pros and cons of having this material as a
resource.
I also have a few others as well.
I have a '58 edition T-II covering '54 to '58 Busses, a '56 edition
covering '47 to '56 T-I and a '71 edition covering Type I from '49...this
last edition is very large (1000 pgs) but has some loop holes due to the
many parts that were already no longer being produced and as such part
numbers are mentioned but no schematics are shown and in most cases a
superceded or replacement part number only is given/listed.
$40 includes shipping for the '67 T-II and '71 T-I.  $22 covers shipping
too for the '56 T-I and the '58 T-II.
