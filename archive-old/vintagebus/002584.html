Pictures up on my site, there's a link from the main page.

Fun weekend, although I found very little to purchase at the show but Greg
Noble (frankiehil_at_aol_dot_com - '57 Standard) tricked me into buying a middle
seat he had.  ;)

Funny story, Greg has had this seat for sale for a couple months, not
advertised too much... but it's out there.  He brings it to the show, people
look at it all day, ask the price ($400), and never give it a 2nd thought.
I'm standing there and we are working a trade for some stuff I have at my
house when this guy, let's call him &quot;Poncho&quot; walks up, asks the price, and
says &quot;I'll take it.&quot;  Greg is a little stunned and says &quot;Well, this guy here
(me) was making a deal with me right now.&quot;  I point out to my competition
that the metal grab rails are broken - that'll set him back some serious
money, if he can even find a set, one leg is sorta rusty, etc., etc..  He
says &quot;Ok, I'll give you $450.&quot;  Apparently he thought I was tricking him
somehow?  By that time, everyone but Greg is laughing at how ridiculous the
situation is.  This guy is crazy to pay $450 for a seat FRAME that needs
some work.  Greg informs him that if I don't buy it, he will sell it for his
$400 asking price and no more.

I ended up with the seat.  :)
