Subject: Exchanged Keys Yesterday

Exchanged keys yesterday and left my 71 bus and drove the 67 bus home.  IN THE
RAIN - WITHOUT TAIL LIGHTS - BRAKE LIGHTS or TURN SIGNALS .. oh .. almost
forgot .. without WIPERS either .. I just coated the windows with some Rainex
and got on the highway.

Got sick of my mechanic putting my bus behind EVERY SINGLE repair job that
came into his shop.  My money is just as good as everyone elses .. and I pay
the second he says &quot;I need money for this or that .. &quot; Yet my bus is the last
thing on his list of priorities.

So I am looking for someone to finish what's left to be done in [electrical
mostly] Central Florida.  Orlando area ..

ALSO .. anyone know a brand of stereo that will fit in the dash of a 67
without having to cut the metal .. MP3 player preferred.  I thought the
opening was pretty large, but not large enough for my Kenwood.

If the Internet was a real super-highway it would
be traveled by slow moving garbage trucks with
big flashing corporate logos on them, little kids
riding tricycles carrying supersoakers filled with
battery acid, and HUGE yellow schoolbuses with
America Online painted on them, filled with kids
throwing stuff out of the windows.
