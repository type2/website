&gt; I just got off the phone with Greg at Parts Obsolete... He made a great

&gt; Greg claims that the offset is different on the T1 VW pulley versus the 
&gt; 912/356 pulley.  Essentially you cannot run a T1 VW pulley on a 912 w/o 
&gt; alignment problems.

Hi Adrian,
That would make sense if the type 1 pulley ended up to far forward.  The 
Porsche pulley we found worked fine once we shimmed the pulley halfs just a 
tad to the rear.  Since this pulley is a three piece item we just installed 
shims between the inner piece and the forward pulley half to realign it.  Are 
912 and 356 generator pulleys the same?   Eric&amp;Barb
