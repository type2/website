Subject: FS, (second posting)  Fire Sale Many, Many Parts

http://www.williamwareagency_dot_com/forsale/firesale0.htm
I'm not going to beat everybody up with all of this stuff I've got for
sale.
I've added three more pages of stuff and I'll be able to make up another
five or so pages with engine cases, type I parts, Type IV sheet metal,
heater boxes, flapper valves etc.
I just ask that you try to go back a couple of times in the next few days
and see what is there.
If you buy a couple of items I'll negotiate some on prices or assist in
delivery fees.
