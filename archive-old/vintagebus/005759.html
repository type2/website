Subject: Re: [VB] They came and took my bus away :(

I would definitely clean it. It's alot of hard work, but once you're done it
lasts. I did mine years ago but I forget what worked the best. If you have a
dremel type tool I'd try that with some kind of rubbing compound. Don't try
a wire wheel, it will leave a nasty swirl pattern!

&gt; Should I paint the aluminum on the Jealousy windows or just
&gt; clean it up?
