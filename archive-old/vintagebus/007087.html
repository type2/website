Guys, I know (Knew) a guy who died by using a catalytic heater in his VW
bus. If
you want to use one that is not vented, DON'T! Especially if you have one of
those rare, well sealed busses.....

&gt; Low oxygen and carbon monoxide alarms/detectors would still be a very good
&gt; idea for backup protection.
