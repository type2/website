Subject: RE: [VB] safari's

&gt;I put them up for $200 even though someone already offered 400 for them. 

Dude, $400 is a very good offer!  Take it.

Or are these the special gold frame edition?!?! 

Not like anyone is retiring on junk trading these days.  In my opinion $400
is too good of an offer...  I know someone will reply that they have seen
them go for $1000 a set in BFE Alaska, I do not care.
