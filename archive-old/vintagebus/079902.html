Subject: Re: [VB] &quot;funny&quot; little engine noise

i had the same thing happen to me. i had a knocking
noise, and most everyone thought it was a rod knock,
well it turned out to be my flywheel knocking against
the tranny.....and a minor rod knock. my advice is to
get a new crankshaft and flywheel.
