I recall HotVW magazine did an article (around '90-91?)about just
that combination:  34PICT3 &amp; 009 dist. 
It involved drilling out the air correction jet and the pump shot
nozzle.  I'm not sure on the details.  I know I saved the article
and an extra nozzle because I intended on trying the fix on the 
next 1600DP I had.  I had the same thing in a Baja Bug years ago 
but I ended up putting a Brazilian Weber on to fix it then.

Good luck,

The topic says it all.  I am about to give up on this carb.  A 34PICT3 on a
1600dp w/009 that checks out O.K. but just won't idle.  I've tried
everything I can think of ( I'm NOT a carb specialist) and have had no luck.
