Ok, Since its Friday,

I like the [VB] as it is short and reminds me of all of the above (I have a
vintage bus, my daughter is playing High School Volleyball and I program with
Visual Basic).   Some less worthy alternatives for list identifiers are:

Code Description    Problem with it
[AB] Ancient Bus    Same age as me better not be ancient yet
[BB] Broken Bus     Take aim at that one
[CB] Cold Bus       10-4 good buddy
[DB] Dead Bus       What's the point of this list
[EB] Ed's Bus       Who the heck is Ed?
[FB] Fried Bus      Got that fire extinguisher?
[GB] Golden Bus     Only for the $32,000 23 Window
[HB] Horny Bus      enuf said
[IB] Internet Bus   brick
[JB] Junk Bus       What we are trying to avoid
[KB] Killer Bus     The NOS restored bus list
[LB] Long Bus       Works only for the Westfailure
[MB] My Bus         Great if your the only one on the list
[NB] New Bus        taken by the New Beetle
[OB] Old Bus        possible, if your not a doctor
[PB] Pink Bus       How many are there
[QB] Quiet Bus      Who's is
[RB] Running Bus    That should be a goal
[SB] Super Bus      They killed the beetle with that one
[TB] Thom's Bus     List initials match a respiratory disease?
[UB] Ugly Bus       has potential
[VB] Vintage Bus    No reason to finish this list
[WB]
[XB]
[YB]
[ZB]

Sorry about that, now I got to get some work done.

Scott
