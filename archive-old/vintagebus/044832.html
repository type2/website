Subject: WTD: 15&quot; Wheels &amp; Front Drums
To: VintageBus_at_type2_dot_com

Im trying to get my hands on a set (5) of the stock 15&quot; bus wheels and a pair 
of nice front drums for &quot;Passie&quot; the 57 hardtop 

Can pick up in AZ or SoCal areas.

Have checked most of my resources here in town, minus a couple of the ABC 
guys, with no luck.  Have a set or two of early bug wheels to throw in too. 
Maybe a few other stupid bits.

I WILL be driving her to OCTO and the Classic this year

Let me know if you have any or any idea where else i should look!
Thanks!
