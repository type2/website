Hello ALL Vintage Bus Listers!

Upon the realization that there were no Full Moon Bus Club campouts during the month of August,
your friendly, local TN members have been planning away! We've spent many hours from many days
finding a spot that we feel would be a suitable camping location for this August and, hopefully,
many Augusts to come. 

We feel that we have finally found just such a spot, and want to invite ANY and ALL to join us for
BUSES ON THE RIVER! 

We would like to invite ALL of our Full Moon buddies, our other club members (the Good Ole Volks),
as well as ANY other VW enthusiast to this event. 

We will be camping alongside the Nolichucky River, at the Nolichucky Gorge Campground in Erwin,
TN. This campground was built by many rafters, kayakers, and hikers hours of fruitful volunteer
efforts. It is positioned within one of the deepest gorges in the entire Southeast, and has great
water accessibility, not to mention literally bordering the National Forest and the Appalachian
Trail. All beverages and all dogs are WELCOME within the campground, so it will be perfect for us!
At only an hour's drive from Asheville and just 2 hours from Knoxville, it makes for the PERFECT
TENNESSEE camping experience! 

If you're into mountain biking, watersports, hiking, eating, fishing, or just plain doing nothing,
then this is the campout for you. The middle of August will be hot, but the water will be cool and
the pines that we will be camping under should provide with ample shade.  Experience August as it
ought to be experienced... with your VW friends, under a full moon, at the Buses On The River
campout! 

Here's the website link... CHECK IT OUT!!  http://www.geocities_dot_com/goodolevolk/busriver.html  The
Food list page is going to be updated repeatedly, as everyone confirms their spots.  We will be
doing a Breakfast Burrito meal for Saturday morning, and will be planning a Saturday evening meal,
as well.  Keep checking back to the page for updates!

For any questions, updates, or to sign up for the food list, and so on... don't be afraid to email
me, Travis Adams: GoodOleVolk_at_yahoo_dot_com   or call (423) 230-0986 , or Richard Austin:
vwcoolbus_at_yahoo_dot_com and (423) 245-1723.

We all look forward to seeing you,
