I used to run 125 x 15 all the way around (the jap car spares) and if
someone cut me off, screw the horn, I just passed them, changed lanes, and
shot those little yellow reflectors at them (yes it was that low). but due
to the fact those tires are hard to get someone to mount and you have to
search through wrecked cars to get one, I now use 125x15 street legal tires
made by&quot;COKERS TIRE&quot; and go for $125 ...I guarantee tire clearance will
never be a problem again.....now, how to stretch those bad boys over a 6in.
rim ......hmmmmmmmm

&gt;Hello Everyone I have a 67 deluxe that was pretty low when I got it. The
&gt;tires in the front of this bus were 185 60 14 and they are pretty low. I
&gt;have a set of Porsche alloys and have adapters on the front and back of
this
&gt;bus that allows them to fit. It brings the rims out about an inch so the
&gt;tires need to taper in a little bit. I was wondering if anyone new or has a
&gt;bus right now with adapters could tell me what is the best type of tire to
&gt;put on my rims (15X6inch). I know this is a taboo on this list but if
anyone
&gt;could tell me I would appreciate it!
&gt;
&gt;Sincerely
