i also know how you feel.  about 6 years ago, a guy ran a red light and hit
me in the driver's doorpost, which ripped the door open, and i flew out of
the bus (no seatbelt-but more on that later). the inertia from the accident
caused the bus to turn 90 degrees and flip over-LANDING ON TOP OF ME. i was
pinned/trapped under the bus until the crowd of people around realized i
was under it and lifted it off of me.  during that time, a guy stole my
camera, but someone followed him and the cops arrested him-he got 6 months
in jail for that one.  i honestly believe if i had been wearing a seatbelt
and remained in the vehicle, i would have been seriously injured since the
headlight bucket was crushed so much, it pushed the clutch pedal to the
floor.  go look... that's not much room for a foot to be in. i was slightly
injured, the bus totalled, but stripped for parts, and helped others stay
on the road.  
safe travels!

&gt; I know how you feel.  I got hit in the 61about 4 years ago,  by someone
who 
&gt; decided to pass when I was turning left into my driveway.  It kinda
messed up 
&gt; my back, and the bus.
