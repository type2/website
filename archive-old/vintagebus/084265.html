Subject: Re: [VB] Busses and winter

easy cheap way:

warm hat, gloves, sox and thermal underwear
can of starting fluid

I never had trouble with driving a bus with temps sub zero F as long as 
I was dressed properly. Starting was never a problem with me, gas 
mileage will decrease though which is normal during cold temps.
