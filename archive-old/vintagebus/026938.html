I think this may be a case where the DMV may have tried to correct something
that wasn't wrong in the first place.  when I took my buses to be
registered...they always tell me that I'm lying about the VIN. Always.  Then I
tell them the situation...I offered to have them look at it...but they aren't
too energetic...so they finally believed me.  Old car VIN's and new car VIN's
are entirely different....so maybe someone at the DMV made up some numbers to
fit in their paperwork then???




&gt;  the VIN
&gt; on the pink slip didn't match the VIN on the car - someone added extra
&gt; numbers for some reason.
