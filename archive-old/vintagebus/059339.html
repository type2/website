&gt; 1.  From every source I have read (Muir, Bentley, archive posts), the timing 
&gt; for my engine and/or distributor is 5 ATDC.  As per the illustrations in 
&gt; both Muir and Bentley, the crank pulley should have one notch, at 5 ATDC.  
&gt; My pulley has three, I assume to be TDC, 7.5 BTDC and 10 BTDC.  I checked 
&gt; the engine from the bus (also timed to 5 ATDC) and it has one notch.  So, 
&gt; where exactly do I set the timing
&gt; statically, and how do I actually know that the TDC notch on the pulley is 
&gt; actually TDC?

Hi Blake,
Where to set your timing depends on the distributor used and size type of 
engine it is used on!  As for your timing marks you need to blueprint them to 
really know what they indicate.  They could be DPO file marks!  At the very 
least use the screwdriver through #1 sparkplug hole to find TDC of that 
piston.  Or do as we do and use an aftermarket degree pulley that has already 
been blueprinted as a measuring tool.


&gt; 2.  Also, in everything I've read, it says to get the engine running to 
&gt; check the dwell, and adjust the timing with the gun.  Mine won't run on its 
&gt; own, but
&gt; given enough gas, it will run at high RPMS and will register a dwell 
&gt; reading.  Is this reading accurate, i.e. can I use it to adjust my points?  
&gt; They seem to be OK with the feeler, but the reading shows the dwell as too 
&gt; high.

Check your jetting of the carb to what size and type of engine you are using, 
clean your carb and even perhaps it needs to be boiled in water for a few 
hours to remove gasolene varnish clogging the passages inside it.   Also go 
through a tune up again and see if that helps the idle.
