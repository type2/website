Subject: [VB] Repro Lit - how to tell
Message-Id: &lt;199911172223.OAA09716_at_web1_dot_calweb_dot_com&gt;

How would I be able to tell if a particular SO42 camper manual is
NOS as claimed or repro.  I've been informed that there was a run
of repops by someone in washington, but the one being presented to
me is being touted as NOS, but it's in super-duper spiffy condition,
ie no traces of aging.  Any clues?

Thanks.

Thom
