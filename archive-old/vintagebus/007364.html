&gt;Man, that was a brutal message to Michelle.

Or mildly amusing, depending on your point o' view...

&gt;One must remember the first time we took a wrench
&gt;to our first VW.

First car. 1969 Electronic Fuel Injected Automatic VW Fastback. $200.00 Took
it to a VW shop and the guy shook his head at me as I was pulling into a
parking space. Son, you better get the Idiot book and learn to work on that
one yourself. No VW mechanic is going to.... Sage advice and I took it. Kept
that car for 13 years then gave it away to a high school kid that was a
nephew of a friend. No one but me ever turned a wrench on it while I had it.
Great car.

&gt;We probably did everything wrong, but somehow
&gt;the damn thing ran anyway.
&gt;That is the magic of VW's.

No question.

Gentle Readers (tm)... Michelle did not find it brutal. I did not find it
brutal, I just wrote it that way so those that like to be offended all of
the time could enjoy it too. This concludes our test of the emergency
broadcasting system...
