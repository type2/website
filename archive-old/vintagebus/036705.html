There are headlight assemblies used on Merc trucks of the '70s era that
appear to be an exact match to those on our buses. I checked with a truck
part dealer in South Africa and it seems that they are still available. They
told me that lenses and seals could be got sepperately. I think I will buy
up their entire stock, put them up on ebay and retire to the Cayman islands
: -)

later
