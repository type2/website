Subject: more knock knock

sorry folks...i left a few things out in the confusion...

1500 single port motor stuck in a 62 bus.  I just put in new pushrod
tubes and seals and just put the motor in last night...

When I left buses nowhere near the arch...i first noticed this...
after starting the bus...and letting it warm up a tad... i would take
off... and in the top end of first and second gear mainly...it would get
to a certain point...and not want to accelerate any more in that gear...
like i put on the brakes or something as i was giving it gas.  i tried
to be nice to it and just upshift to lower the rpms...and this worked
for me all the way home from Missouri...after the motor was running for
a while... it was no problem.  this happened again this morning...as it
does every time after i start the bus up and drive it after its been
sitting a while...
just as i was getting to the upper end of 2nd gear...it gave out and
started making that knocking sound just as it didn't want to accelerate
any more in that gear..

maybe this is of some help?

Isaiah
