There are stale air and fresh air ones.  The stale air ones are flat, the 
fresh have the bump thing for around the left fresh air tube from fan 
shround, though the stale ones fit the fresh fan shrouds.   Unless you use a 
centain manifold  that gives its the 40hp bus offset, it does not line up 
with the tab on the air cleaner arm, making you wonder why you got this 
useless triangle.  to get that offset, you will have problems with the carb 
hitting the large diameter generator.    These came on 6V small gen 40hp  and 
36hp motors,  which many people do not run in the buses these days, sad world 
that it is, what's the matter with these kids today?  Probably the same thing 
that was wrong with them yesterday.   Meaning go make an adaptor piece out of 
metal with two holes drilled in.    Or make a triangle with out of metal with 
three holes drilled in, paint it black to match the fan shroud.  Or neon 
green with hot pink polka dots so it can't be missed.  Very eighties.  People 
will envy you.

If anyone wants to, you can take a pic of my 61's triangle with adaptor and 
post it publicly.  It is currently modeling the more restrained un frilled 
stale air triangle, I believe, in traditional semi gloss black, dashing 
nouveau holder adaptor on a bug DP 1600 with sp 30/31 carb for better idling, 
and tasteful Sealing Wax Red backdrop.

  &gt;need the triangle air cleaner bracket for a 40 hp motor. The brackets
  &gt;mounts to the fan housing and the coil mounts on top of it.
 
 You know, I had needed one of these too. I yanked one off of a 1300cc
 engine I had. But it didn't fit quite right. I made it work, but wouldn't
 mind having one that'll do the job better.
 My engine is a '75 1600cc. I don't know what the fan shroud is off of. But
 the air cleaner is the one that belongs with the bus.
 So are the little brackets different from different engines?
