Subject: Alternator questions?

I finally got the 1776 together and running in my Crew Cab again. Took it for a test drive tonight and it was smooth and powerful. The only thing concerning me is that the alternator got really hot. It is not making any noise, the belt may be
a hair tight and I will try one more shim tomorrow. Does anyone have any ideas on this? I am hoping to make the 4 hour drive up to Seattle in it on Sunday and would like to get some input before I decide to take it or not.
thanks in advance for any tips,

Anyone going to be up at the Bow-Wow bug bash in Bellevue next sunday?
