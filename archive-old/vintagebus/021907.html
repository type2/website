Rex writ:
&gt;It would be very much appreciated if you vintage guys out there would bite
your tongue a bit on this one and not come back with &quot;why would you do that
to a bus&quot; or &quot;leave it the way it was meant to be&quot;. If you've got a real
world experience of why it didn't work for you or some other bus you've
experienced in person, defiantly let us all know. &lt;

I am definitely not a vintage nazi and curious about some of these
conversions myself if at all practical.  Hey we are driving relic cars and
they could use a little modernization.

The type4 power conversion is great and is well documented.  The 1979 brake
conversion has been very interesting.  And other rewarding and practical
ideas that have been shown in the past have been great.

BUT, some of these &quot;new&quot; and &quot;kwel&quot; ideas are just loony-tunes.  Porsche 911
motors are a serious hack into a bus.  Porsche wheels can be done but a
serious PITA, $$$, and usually people know nothing of what will fit to begin
with.  Porsche trannies are worth more than the busses and will not work
right without being done in conjunction with other serious changes.

I am not knocking customization, but do not expect a show winner tricked out
pimp mobile 21 window bass rumbler on a shoe string budget.  It will take
more money than you will ever sell it for and the ROI is not there at all.
Most likely some kid will start a half-assed custom project and one of us
will come and pick up the pieces in his moms back yard for pennies on the
dollar, if we ever want the pieces.

This ties in perfect with the old line &quot;Speed cost money.  How fast do you
want to go?&quot;.

If a customization trick works lets do it, but if it is ridiculous I am
going to call a spade a spade.
