another bumper oddity,  my 1964 SO-35 bus has a switzerland (SZ) delivery 
code, yet the front bumper has holes for overriders.  I believe it is the 
original front bumper because it also has the holes in it for the front 
westy tent pole.  Were overriders considered spec for switzerland?  The bus 
was also configured as euro, electrically (3 wire turn signal switch, but 
euro headlights and tailights long gone though :-(   )

Doing lots of body work this week.  rockers, and right rear corner are in.  
In case anybody cares, early baywindow corners are a pretty good fit from 
the beltline to the battery tray at least.  Wheel wells go in tomorrow.  
Patching cargo floor maybe on friday &amp; saturday.  Wheee!  Semester break has 
been good to me, if I could just get rid of that nagging guilty feeling 
telling me I should be at the lab doing some research or something...

Anyway...
Mike A.

&gt;question Date: Wed, 3 Jan 2001 07:41:29 -0800
&gt;
&gt;Matt and I both have 1960 DD panels here in Havasu, his was built 30,000 
&gt;before mine. We both have M-code 360 (U S spec according to Thom's site), 
&gt;but his has M-code 175 also (overrider bumpers) but mine doesn't and it 
&gt;came with over rider bumpers. So the question is? Did VW include override 
&gt;bumpers as a standard item in the late 60's as part of the U S spec 
&gt;package? or could the over rider bumpers on mine just have been added 
&gt;later? What were the M-codes on the 2 60 DD's you found Thom?
&gt;
&gt;Ronnie inquirering minds need to know
