Yup.... At Ubehebe Crater in Death Valley during a &quot;High wind advisory&quot; kinda
day...

Leaving the parking lot in my old '70, and got hit by a strong wind from the
side. Dunno exactly what happened, but the wind lifted the top to full upright
position. Didn't quite know what to do - stop and put it back down and risk the
whole top being torn off? Or, continue driving (luckily in the same direction
as the wind) until I could pull up behind that big sheltering rock in 300
yards?

Pulled up behind the rock, pulled the top back down, and discover that the
rubber latches had been torn in half....they were fairly new, only 2 years old.
Had to get out the rope and tie it between the pop-top handle and the rear
seat. It held nicely like that for the rest of the trip, no damage done (except
for latches)

&gt; YIKES&gt;....boy does that sound familiar ! Except noone flaged me down :(  I
&gt; had looked inside the bus and say the rubber latches were down, but it flew
&gt; off anyways.   Maybe they are fine as long as you dont have it on a
&gt; trailer....has anyone else had theirs fly off while just driving it ?
