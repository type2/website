Hi Bryan,
First you should visit Thom's web page and feed in your Mcodes from the plate 
behind or possibly under the front passenger seat.  This will tell you alot 
about what you have.  Then if you want to post your Mcodes to the list with 
the results volks can tell you more about it.  As for your far left switch on 
the dash you will have to trace the wires under the dash to see where they 
go.  Also compare these wires to the rest of the wiring loom.  Does it look 
like the wires to this switch are home installed or more factory?
  As for your windows they could have been a factory, dealer, aftermarket, or 
DPO installation.  Can you tell if the windows in question are seated in the 
pressed in window holes in the side panel or were holes cut in and the 
windows mounted?
