&gt;The only thing you need to consider is that they are butt-ugly,
&gt;and anyone who runs them had better not show their face at a show less they
&gt;endure extreme ridicule and shame!
&gt;
Finally, a thoughtful and sensible reason for not running them. The ones I
have on my hacked V8 limo bus are turned around backwards to keep liquid
sunshine from getting on the electricals in the engine compartment. Someone
hacked the vents out. I will have to remove them immediately before some
purist at one of the shows gives me a wedgie for wearing scoops.

FWIW I have always found them to deliver about a 10 degree drop in oil temp
at highway speed on non-V8 equipped buses. A necessary addition for daily
drivers here in Phoenix. Provided you aren't going to shows, of course. Not
the old-timey fiberglass scalloped ones, though, they are too shallow. The
new flimsy plastic ones work well.
