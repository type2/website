Well, if this is a sign of revolt, then I'm all the more proud for doing 
so.  www.vw_dot_com has this big involved (rather impressive) sneak peek at the 
New Microbus.  After you get thru all the flashy video and pop up menus, 
you have the opportunity to give feedback.  Oh, I did allright.  ;)  Spent 
easily a half hour just critiquing all the drawbacks of the New Micro 
(including the Eurovan sized price) and reinforcing how versatile and 
valuable the old Bus (our buses) is.

Frankly, VW makes me sick by not supporting the people who keep their cars 
and their products alive and on the road.  I've seen how all the other 
American car companies support their older cars (though no one's owning up 
to the Gremlin ;)...why does VW (or at least VWoA) have to be so hardnosed 
about it?
