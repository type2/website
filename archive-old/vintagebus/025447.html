Subject: Redux box bolts &amp; 5 speed?
Message-ID: &lt;3756D749.FDC918DC_at_nations_dot_net&gt;

Hi ho y'all
2 issues.  First, what's the size of the bolts that attach the redux box
to the plate?  I want to clean the threads and install fresh bolts,
without waiting for my local nut guy to come up with bolts and have to
search for a tap AFTER I start the disassembly..

Second, I don't know how long it's been since (or if ever) this
question's come up but here goes.  I'm REALLY happy with the Tinkertoy
right now.  The only thing I could want is an extra gear.  I like the
stock ratios right up to about 57 mph.  After that she just sounds like
she's working harder than she needs to.  She'll do 65-70 all day but
she's plainly unhappy about it.  Oil temp goes up, sound level increases
etc.

My question:  Is there a 5 speed conversion that won't eliminate the
reduction gears or make for a huge bastardization of a basically really
good vehicle?  I don't need (or want) to go 80 mph, but 65 - 70 with a
15 - 20% reduction in RPM would be nice.  Has anyone done this?  What's
involved?  How much$?

Dave
