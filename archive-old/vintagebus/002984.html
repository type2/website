Subject: Speedo not NOS

FYI:

NOS Barndoor speedo:
http://cgi.ebay_dot_com/ebaymotors/aw-cgi/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&amp;item=591575774

is _NOT_ new old stock.

Why:
NOS speedos don't have faded red lines at the shift marks.
NOS speedos don't have all the zeros partially turned over, although speedos
that have just flipped 100,000 miles do.  ;(
From memory, every NOS speedo I have seen had 00003 miles on it, not 00004.

Just a public service announcement since at least 1 listee was bidding on
it...

Later,
Everett
