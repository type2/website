Well not exactly, I am just tearing it down to the center section to replace 
with a Rancho 4.12.  So far so good, things have been going pretty well.  Had 
no problems with the RGB's.  I removed the nose cone today and ran across the 
front bearing.  WOW!  That sucker is totally chomped.  All the little 
shavings worked their way into it and sarred that thing up pretty bad.  
Things are looking up though and hopefully I wont be stuck here at my house 
for too much longer.  If anyone has any suggestions or pointers regarding 
putting this all back together let me know.  It's my first time.

Drive your VW if it has a tranny
