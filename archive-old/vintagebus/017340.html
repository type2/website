I took a lot of flamage last year on this topic, and my nomex are all
ready to go this year.

Like I said last year, running an unsafe bus is a desperate measure.
It's one thing to break down in BFE and have to limp into town
without all systems 100%.  There aren't any Chinese tanks rolling down
the street towards your house.  No mushroom cloud drifting towards your town.
No wildfire encroaching on your home.  No dam about to burst.  Desperate
times call for desperate measures.  Driving several hundred miles
into the desert to party isn't one of them.

I never said the buses had to be pretty, or even painted.  I'm 
sensing at least one person is going to try and outdo the &quot;hero&quot;
who limped a bus he drug out of a field umpteen hundred miles to
go to the show.  I guess it will take someone getting, or giving,
a D*rwin award in a headlong rush to get a Jerry Jess award, before
people wise up.  Save the heroism for rescuing children from burning
buildings.

I'm all for putting buses on the road.  All of the buses I've owned
are &quot;rescues.&quot;   While it's great to have buses on the road, I would
rather have a bus sitting in the shop, hell, out in the field, rather 
than out on the open road with iffy brakes, no registration, no insurance,
and held together with duct tape and bailing wire.

Nowhere have I seen it stated that Jerome is about getting buses
there at any cost, sanity and safety be damned.  From what I can
tell, Jerome is about getting tanked for several days straight.  

It's amazing how much list traffic is devoted to safety throughout the year;
what type of tires to use, upgrading to dual-circuit master cylinders,
seat belt installation, brake system, etc.  Then Jerome comes 'round
and the sentiment is &quot;f*ck it, get the bus there any way you can&quot;

There's enough people with &quot;extra&quot; buses that it shouldn't be too hard
to find someone who's going that way and borrow one of theirs.  Or,
if you don't have a safe bus of your own, bum a ride.  Seeing all the
other buses there will get you jonesin' to get yours on the road.

I don't have to have ever been to Jerome to see the foolishness of 
slapping an unsafe hoopty together to get to the show.  That's the beauty of
common sense - multi-platfrom interopability.  I don't need a &quot;Jerome
10.0 plugin&quot;

I'm telling anyone not to go to Jerome, or not to drive their buses.  I'm
saying *think* about what you're doing.  This is not some jihad of
bus driving. There is no fatwah for driving a bus to Jerome.  See the
forest for the trees.  Recycle.  Give a hoot, don't pollute.  Visualize
whirled peas.

&gt; WHOA! Not everybody drives around a yellow submarine with vintagebus_dot_com 
&gt; plastered on the side. If you have never been to an Jerome event, don`t knock 
&gt; it BUD........
&gt;   What`s wrong with getting every bus we can back on the road,whether it be 
&gt; Jerome or any other yearly event. Thought that was what the whole idae was, 
&gt; evidently i was wrong. =)
