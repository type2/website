A closed-casket wake will be held Friday from 2 to 4 p.m. and 7 to 9 p.m. at
the Quinn-Hopping Funeral home on Mount Pleasant Avenue in Livingston. The
funeral will be held on Saturday.

If you would like to send flowers please call the Hanover Florist in
Livingston, NJ _at_ (973) 887-5241.  They are the families selected florist as
per the funeral home.  I am sure they will be quite busy so please do so
asap.

I am personally sending some for the AIRS group.  Jamie Auch will be at the
Memorial service this evening as a representative of A.I.R.S. and the type2
list.  Others will more than likely also attend.

Thanks,

Charlie Ford

&quot;Lessons learned are like bridges burned, you only need to cross them but
once.  Is the knowledge gained worth the price of the pain?  Are the spoils
worth the cost of the heart?&quot;
