Hi,

I took a look into my original owners manual for my early
64. The Gear ratios are listed as follows:

1st        3.80
2nd        2.06
3rd        1.22
4th        .82

R&amp;P    4.125:1

RGB    1.26

?????????

My P205 75-15 radials have a diameter of radius of 12.5&quot;
give or take a little depending upon inflation and load.

65mph should give 3712 RPM

70mph should give 4011 RPM

 Your post looks pretty good and informative. I drive my bus
as fast as traffic is moving and have no problem. Current
engine is 13 years old and has around 65K miles on it.
Plenty of those miles have been driven at 70-75 mph.
Maintenance has been minimal on the cheapest dual port
rebuild I could buy from Scat at that time.

Chris
