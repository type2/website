ive been thinking about the airscoop thing, if the bus is sealed in the
engine compartment, ie without holes where the battery pan is rusted out,
aerodynamically speaking , wouldnt the air passing over the vents actually
tend to suck air out rather than in, like smoke in a normal car where you
can roll the windo down a bit and all the smoke goes out?  and would this
tend to pull in hot air from the bottom?

oh and by the way , you r local good will or salvation army probably has a
pile of $5 keyboards, they always do, i bought one that i use on my laptop,
and an extra just in case.

are you sure the keyboard isnt set to   &quot;espeak&quot;  espanenglish?

&gt;
&gt; but, i tried running =with andx =without dxuring the esummer laest year. i

&gt; label them aes bad altogether.
