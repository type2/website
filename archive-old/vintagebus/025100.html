i was trying to decode my m-codes last night on my 64 kombi and her's
what i came up with.
-------------------------------------
01    6
430    013    025    114    531
UT    2313    424280
---------------------------------------
june 1st 1964
430 - U.S. equipment with dual circuit brakes
013 - middle seat and rear seat
025- seat belts
114 -  6 pop outs
531- stiffer rear suspension
UT- U.S. destined but picked up in Europe
2313-kombi w cargo doors rht. &amp; l.h.d.7 seater
4242 torquise bottom and top
80 interior grey


i'm am not sure if all of these are correct but i know it has the dual
circuit brakes and factory lap belts,
saets obviously the popouts and the colors but.but the 531 code is that
correct?
does anybody know the specs. on the stiffer suspension ?
also the UT , i have been told that it was the european pick up code(you
know buy the bus ,fly to the motherland to pick it up and cruise around
a few weeks and ship it back.or a G. I.).maybe thats why the decklid was
drilled to fit euro plates and welded up and drilled again for amer.
plates.
any corrections or input would be appreciated!
Thanks ahead of time!!!!!!!
