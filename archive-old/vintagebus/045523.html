&lt;&lt;Sounds like you need to rip off the fan shroud and pull off the adapter
the PO decided that he needed and reinstall a good factory oil cooler.
Get rid of the aftermarket oil cooler in front of the air intake on the
fan shroud so you won't pre-heat the air coming in.&gt;&gt;

I too have one of these ( in the same spot ) that the PO had installed.  Can
this be removed without pulling the engine?  

Thanks
