&lt;&lt; this one has to do with the 9 small hooks that hold up the mesh net in the 
rear above the rear deck.  Can someone tell me what color these are supposed 
to be?  Mine have been smeared with green paint, but they look like they were 
maybe black originally. &gt;&gt;
Hi Robert,
The ones we have found are made of a brass hook cast over a steel threaded 
stud.  No paint just brass.  Eric&amp;Barb
