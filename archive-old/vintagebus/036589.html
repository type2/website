 I have a '67 westy that was pretty complete and unmolested when I bought it
 a few years ago. About an inch below both side interior lights are two small
 holes (one on top of the other). Does anyone know what mounts in these
 holes, or is it a hack of some sort?

 From this pic there doesn't seem to be anything there. Just curious.

hi jim , im parting out a 67 westy and the two side lights have the same 
lights as the over head lights but they have a white plastic cover on the 
side ones with the switch right on them.    i guess it difuses the light so 
its not so bothersome at eye level.
it looks really nice with the interior and the curtains.
if you need them let me know.
