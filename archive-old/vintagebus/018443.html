I remember around november or dec of 1998 i think someone wrote into the list
the name of a place that makes xmas lights that were battery posered, desigend
for cars i think? I remember the place is in Chicago. I can't remember the
name but i will search my archives for it...it should be in the vintage bus
archives...
