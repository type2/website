Subject: RE:keys for bus

I'm a registered locksmith in Texas specializing in VW and British auto.  I 
can also do the code work that is requested.  I'm a member of the vintage 
and Type2 list, and a preferred vendor on the Vanagon list.

Most locksmiths will be able to cut that key.  If you want one of the 
original style keys, both Gabriel and myself offer the service.  I'm not 
aware of anyone else able to supply and cut those.
