Just got home from the IMAX cinema.  We have the world's largest screen
right here in Adelaide, South Australia
Anyway, in the 3D movie &quot;Encounter&quot; there's a bit where they're driving
down the freeway and in the left hand lane theres a really neat looking
white on green bus, looks to be &lt;64-67&gt;.
