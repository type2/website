  What is done is to lengthen the axle tubes approx. 1 1/2 inches, then you
use the short end castings and the long axles either short or long spline.
You cannot see where they are lenthened as that part is pressed back in the
end casting.

ronnie   been there done that

The spring plates are special hacks, if you are a compotent welder you could
probably do it. The axles tubes are slightly? shortened 68 long spliners,
and the axles are just that TIII/T1 1968er, long spline/long alxes. Axle
ends appear to be stock, but the brakes are useally tIII installed swapped,
so ebrake and cyl are in TII attitude.

You cannot use the stock 68 tubes and plates, your wheels will hit stuff, I
am told.
This is based on the wolfgang kit I just removed.

 I am interested in putting a straight axle kit.

 What I need to know is, does anyone really know how to actually MAKE the
 straight axle kit?
 What spring plates are used, what axle tubes are used, and what axle ends
 are used, and how is it all put together in the end? I am just curious,
 because it really looks like a '68 bug rear end, but I figure it couldn't
be
 just that easy.

 Any information would be greatly appreciated.

 Thanks
