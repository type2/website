   We used 2 of the 3 inch diameter bilge fans in my friends 21 window. The
mistake we made was putting them in-line from the heater boxes to the body,
worked great till both fans melted down! So to cure the problem we bought a
bigger bilge fan and mounted it behind the front beam (in the main heater
tube), works great and all you can hear is the fan a little. Can defrost the
front windscreens in a couple minutes now.

It is a small fan that fits onto the 3&quot; heater channel that goes from the
engine to the defrost/heater vents. You cut out a section and clamp this fan
in and run a switch to the dashboard. It improves the heat flow by about a
million percent. It blows heat even when you are at an idle.

There is a company that sells a kit advertised in Hot VWs that is not wildly
overpriced, but it is available at any good boating store. Just ask for a 3&quot;
inline fan.

&gt; &gt; I put in a boat inline fan to boost the heaters (A GREAT IDEA!!!!) and
drove it a week ago in the snow, and I'm installing the AC later this month.
Yakima now makes some tower extensions ($40) that make their raingutter
towers tall enough for the bus and now I carry ladders on top.
&gt; &gt; It makes fun out of driving.
