Subject: Fleetline panelvan resurrected (long)

Hey Volks

I mentioned a couple of weeks back that I was nearly
finished rebuilding my Fleetline panelvan. The bus has been
back on the road for two weeks now, and it's been very hard
at work transporting my huge parts stash from my old garage
to my new one. And I've already had one person hand me his
card in the traffic and ask to buy the van :-)

See quick pics of the van here:

I have owned this van since January 1993, and it was my
daily driver for eight years, during which time I
drove it 80,000km. In 2000 I built the ZebraBus and started
driving it as my daily, so put the panel into
semi-retirement, as its engine needed rebuilding and the
paint and body were looking very tatty.

Not that being tatty was anything new for this van -- I'd
had it for less than a year when, in November 1993, we got
hit from behind by a double-decker bus. OUCH!!! The worst of
the impact was on the left rear corner, with the whole
back-end of the van pushed in by several inches and the left
rear side was badly concertinaed. All I did by way of
repairs at the time was to replace the rear hatch and engine
hatch; with straight hatches fitted it became very clear
just how far the back of the van had been pushed in. I then
took the van to my local repair shop and asked them to pull
out the back until it lined up with the new hatches. And
that was all. I left all the dents and the mismatched paint
on the hatches and drove that van for another seven years. I
always kept it scrupulously roadworthy, because cops loved
to pull us over because of the way the van looked. I never
got fined, and I was once given a commendation for the
&quot;excellent condition of my vehicle&quot;, which had me laughing
all the way to work.

Anyway, as many of you know, I drove the ZebraBus across
Africa and sold it in Germany last year. On my return home,
my only street-legal splitty was my 63 Dormobile, which I
drove daily until a maintenance backlog (broken head stud
and leaking right front brake seals) forced me to put it
back in the garage until I have time to fix it. In the
meantime, I wanted another splitty for a daily driver (I do
have an old Mercedes, but I prefer to drive ACVWs). I don't
like using the Dormer as a daily driver so it was time to
resurrect my panelvan.

The first job was to strip the van completely. In September
I removed the engine, all window glass, lights, bumpers and
doors, then towed the rolling shell to a backyard bodyshop
for a rough and ready panel job and new paint. Because of
the collision damage to the rear, I don't consider this van
a restoration proposition, but it still makes a great daily
driver, and one that is more expendable than something like
my Dormer or my 57 Kombi.

So I wasn't too concerned with the quality of the
bodywork -- I just wanted it a bit straighter and fully
painted, and cheap. Which is what I got. The result won't
win any shows, but I reckon I got more than my money's
worth! The left rear side still has a wave on it big enough
to surf, and lots of filler, but the van is fully and
consistently painted, for the first time in a decade, and it
looks better now than at any previous time while I have
owned it.

I spent the past month reassembling the van, and all parts
and fittings are present and correct. My girlfriend Gisela
made the cab floor mat, cutting it out of a sheet of new
ribbed rubber, using an old mat as a pattern. I gave the
body guy a pair of Fleetline Kombi cargo doors (with
windows) to paint, as I couldn't locate any good panel
doors, and I like having the extra visibility on my blind
side. I had the van painted white, with a dark green swage
and green roof, bumpers and wheels. I think it looks pretty
cool. Original colour on this van was pale blue all over.
The rear hatch is from a 60 German Kombi; the correct rear
hatch on Fleetline panelvans has a big back window, like a
Deluxe.

I have a newly built (with oil pressure problems; I'll
prolly have to strip and reassemble) engine for the Dormer,
so I thought I'd use the Dormer engine in the panel, after
fixing the broken head stud. Well, that was the plan, but
fate would have otherwise. I pulled the engine and the
offending head and barrels, to expose the stump of the
broken stud. I couldn't get a drill near it, so tried
cutting a slot in it so I could turn it with a screwdriver.
Nice idea ... except the studs are so hard I couldn't even
make a mark on it. Next I tried welding the broken stud to
the stump in the hope I could get it out that way. I welded
it three times, and three times snapped it at the weld on
the first twist.

At that point I gave up and took the engine to an
engineering shop to remove the broken stump. But they had no
luck either. The only remaining option, they said, was to
subject the stud to some or other burning process, which
would entail splitting the case. Bummer! This was a
perfectly good engine built some years ago on a brand new
Brazilian universal case, and it had only covered about
30,000km. The shop said they could not do the repair and
rebuild this year, and that I should bring the engine back
in January after the holidays.

Which left me with no engine and no one prepared to build me
one before next year. Which left me only one choice: pull a
sub-assembly from my stash and buy a recon on exchange from
the (marginally) more reputable of the two local mass ACVW
reconditioners.

So now the van is all bright and shiny with new paint, and
powered by an H-case single-port 1600 engine with alternator
and doghouse cooling set-up. Original engine on this van was
a twin-port 1600 (it's a 75, remember).

The van is not quite finished yet, as I still need to fit
the new door rubbers and the rear bumper. Both quick jobs,
but the priority has shifted from building the van to
moving/stripping my collection of scrap splitties and moving
my parts stash, which all has to be done by Christmas. I
will also eventually make interior panels for the cab and
load area.

The van has already made several runs loaded to the gunwales
with engines, transmissions, body parts, etc. This van
swallows huge and heavy loads and moves them about without
complaint. I remember now why I used to love driving this
van so much!

I am in the process of stripping what remains of the scrap
buses. I will post pics when I'm done. I have moved some
of the buses I intend to keep, and still have to move
another four. I have sold all of the restorable buses that
I didn't want to keep, including a 61 double cab, a 61
Westfalia and a 67 ambulance. I had quite a few people
clamouring for the westy and the ambulance, and I was keen
to sell them only to someone who would restore them and keep
them in South Africa. The guy who bought them assured me
that he wanted them for himself and his partner, and that
they would restore them. So I was pretty pissed off to see
both buses for sale recently on www.air-cooled_dot_net, for
ridiculous pound prices way higher than I sold them for.

This guy owns the buses now and he can do what he likes with
them. But I'm annoyed because he knew I didn't want them to
leave the country, and he assured me that he wanted them for
his collection. And if I had knowingly sold them to a
scalper, I would have priced them much higher.

I guess the lesson is that it's a global market now. Splitty
buses have had almost zero value in this country for years,
and there were a lot of comparatively rust-free buses
around. Now the poms have discovered SA buses and they are
busy ransacking the country for every splitty they can lay
their hands on, with at least three UK-based websites now
boasting SA buses for sale.

The result, of course, is that splitties locally are about
to increase in value radically, to levels approaching the
ridiculous prices that the poms are prepared to pay, and
thus dictate the market value. It's not all bad news,
though, as it means that the buses in my collection are
appreciating hugely. You can be sure that next time I sell a
splitty, it will be priced accordingly.

OK, that's the end of that rant. I'll make another report
once I've made some headway stripping the scrap buses.
