Subject: front end rebuild woes

Hello List,

I finally got some time this evening to work on the front end of my bus 
again.  Last time I posted I had replaced the swing lever bushing and the 
pin inside was *tight*.  I'd also run into a problem with the drivers side 
torsion arms out of alignment, leading me to believe that one, or both of 
them was bent.

I called up bus boys soon after posting and had them ship me a top and 
bottom torsion arm.  I also made up my mind that I would push out the center 
pin, and try to take a bit more material off the bushings with a brake hone, 
since I had already sent the hand reamer back to bus boys.

Well, this evening I went about doing all that.  First, I pulled the upper 
drivers side torsion arm.  Replaced with unit from bus boys, and checked the 
alignment.  Still 5.0 mm, so I then assumed that it must be the bottom arm 
that is bent.  Remove sway bar, undo lower shock bolt, and pull off lower 
torsion arm and replace.  Measure again, and I'm at 5.3 mm.  WTF?  I was 
hoping that after swapping out both arms, I would come in right at 7.0mm and 
be good to go.  Bentley doesn't list what to do now, since it assumes that 
you have a nifty measuring tool to check torsion arms.  Idiot manual, 
however, lists two other possible reasons for misalignment even after 
replacing both torsion arms.  One is a bad bearing inside the torsion tube.  
I don't think that is the case, there doesn't appear to be any slop in the 
arm when I move them up and down.  Next possibility is bent torsion 
tubes/leaves.  I checked by tying a piece of string to both lower torsion 
arms, and measuring the distance from the string to the torsion tubes at 
both ends of the beam, and the beam is not bent, at least as far as this 
crude measuring technique says.  The only other possibility I can see is 
that the torsion arms from bus boys are bent too.  That is a possibility 
since bus boys does not check their torsion arms for alignment.  They had 
the jig to do this in the past, but it was borrowed and never returned.  Any 
other suggestions?  The only possible comination of torsion arms I have not 
tried is a new lower, and the old upper one.  I'll try that next time and 
see what the numbers come out at.

Next project, remove swing lever pin and take a bit more material off the 
bushings.  Well, the pin won't come out.  I told you it was tight.  so I 
dropped the beam and got it on the workbench so I could get a running start 
at it :-)  The pin goes in until the top of it is level with the upper 
bushing, and then it stops.  I guess I mushroomed out the top of the pin, 
and it is jammed.  Damn!  After alot of hammering, trying to get a puller to 
fit on, and penetrating oil, I finally whack the base of the pin to try and 
push it through again.  The top bushing stays attached to the pin, and comes 
out of the beam.  The bushing is now ruined, and so is the pin.  Out comes 
the grinder, cut a slot parallel to the direction of the pin, split the 
bushing with a cold chisel and it comes right off.  I have to grind out the 
end of the pin so it will slide out past the lower bushing, which is still 
in good shape.

So, now I'm right back where I was about 2 weeks ago, beam out of bus, 
needing swing lever bushings and with misaligned torsion arms on the drivers 
side.  Sigh.  I'm not sure what I did to accumulate such bad karma, but this 
front end has really given me alot of headaches.  The frustrating thing is 
that it seems like it should be so easy.

Anyway, plan of attack now is to get *another* swing lever kit.  Does anyone 
sell the kits with just the pin and the bushings?  I've already got all the 
other hardware from my last attempt.  I will find an adjustable reamer here 
locally to borrow/buy so that this time I can get the diameter right.  My 
whole purpose in renting the reamer from bus boys was to make my life 
simpler, but it has been the complete opposite.  Either the reamer they 
rented me was too small, or the pin OD was too big.

What to do about the torsion arm alignment?  I will try the old/new arm 
configuration I listed above, but with the way my luck has been going 
lately, I'm sure it will come out at around 5.2 mm.  At this point, I'm 
going to fudge it, and set up the link pin shims as if the measurement came 
out at 5.5 mm (minimum tolerance) and call it good enough.  If I lived in 
redding, CA and had easy access to lots of torsion arms to try out I would 
send these back to bus boys and get new ones.  The fact that the alignment 
came out almost exactly the same with two new torsion arms is making me 
wonder if there's something else going on here besides bent torsion arms.  
Ideas anyone?  I'm just getting tired of finding things wrong and having to 
redo them, and wait for more parts to come.  But hey, I'm learning alot!

Thanks for any info &amp; suggestions.  Has anybody else run into this kind of 
grief rebuilding a front end?  I guess maybe I'm just at the bottom end of 
the learning curve.

Thanks for reading through this long, and rambling post.
