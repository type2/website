Hi Ronnie,
Did you have an oil temp gauge on the last engine or are you going to have 
one on the new?  We would really apprieciate hearing about the outside and 
engine temps you encounter/ed.  We like to keep ours below 230F and prefer 
160-210F.  Eric&amp;Barb
PS Thanks for the info on the trailer tires.  Kind of thought that might be 
the case.  We will keep an eye on the tires and think they should be OK since 
we do not drive over 70MPH and are heavy duty.  We will check out the 
Firestones next.  EEE&amp;B
