Subject: Decorative License plates

With over 250 people looking at the plates and only 13 wanting to order,
I think that I probobly won't be able to do it.

For those who were not interested, would you please take a moment to
tell me why you wouldn't order. Please indicate one of the following.
I did not like the:
	a)-style
	b)-price
	c)-shape (prefer european look, I am looking into this one)
	d)-colors
	e)-idea of it

	f)I am required by state law to have 2 state plates.
	g) other- please explain

For those in the last catagory, I have seen brakets that allow you to
put 2 plates in the front, though I don't have any. :(

Thank you very much for the feedback.
