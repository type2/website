Hi Joel,
First check if the front end of your bus has any sag to either side on flat 
ground.  If noticable tilt is there you probably have broken one or more of 
the each nine torsion springs.  Also check each of the trailing arms at where 
they enter the front beam.  If there is any up-down or front rear slop you 
probably need to replace the front bushings or needle bearings depending on 
the year bus or suspension you have.
