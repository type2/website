Dont think of the japanese as stealing our buses, think of them as funding
our obsession.  If the Japanese are as into buses as they have been Levis,
then its a great opportunity for listees to make money on some of this hard
work and use the funds to put even more buses back on the road.  The thing
to do would be to find out what these buses are going for in japan and use
an exporter to get a more direct sale and make some real bread.  And besides
think of all the money that the guy that makes shifter extentions will make,
he is set, ;-). So i say domo arigato, zank you very much, etc.

&gt; As a seller that is perfection.  While I am as patriotic as anyone (8
years
&gt; military service, Eagle Scout, etc.) I have got to say I would gladly do
&gt; business with these guys again.  Sure I would love to see the bus stay in
my
&gt; home town but in reality Los Angeles or Tokyo I will probably never see it
&gt; again.  As long as it is going to an enthusiast I'm okay with it...and I
&gt; don't think anyone would part with $8K on a whim, it takes an enthusiast.
