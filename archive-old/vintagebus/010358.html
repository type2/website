Greetings one and all,

After several months of searching I finally got my bus.

The bus bug bit me hard on the buttocks a while back and I've been a man
possessed ever since. I searched in the paper and on the 'net I looked at
several busses in the Portland, OR area, and then ( wouldn't you know it )
I spied my prize sitting on the street six blocks from my house. The PO is
a nice old guy who had too many old cars sitting around so he decided to
sell his '62 kombi. After about 2 minutes of haggling I relieved him of his
bus, and he was 850 dollars richer. REALLY nice guy, said he thought he
had the middle seat somewhere, didn't think he had the rear one though.
A couple of days later he calls and says he can bring over both seats. So
I removed the Z-bed that was back there and replaced the seats, since my
plan is to do a complete restoration.

My first question for the list: what is the going price for z-beds such as
mine?

My second question is a philosophical one. I've been lurking on the list for
about 3 months now and I'm wondering where I might fit in. I'd love to post
links to detailed photos of my bus and get expert opinions on my project,
keep the list informed of my progress etc., but I notice there's a lot of
discussion
of Newbies not respecting the intent of the list. I understand the &quot;check
the
archives, muir, sermons (not available now right?) before you ask what the
proper spark plug gap for your particular model year is&quot; idea, but what
about
&quot;check out this rust &lt;link&gt; what do I do first in my particular
circumstance?&quot;

I love to hear what the group thinks about the role of the newbie. This
thread
may have been hashed over and over for all I know, but I am a newbie right?

In any event I am JAZZED about my new bus, and I really appreciate all the
hard work that goes into keeping this community going and all the great info
it provides.

thanks,

Jeff Golden
Portland, Oregon
