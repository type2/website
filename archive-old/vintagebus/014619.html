Subject: Swap meet in KC on Sunday
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com


The MoKan VW Club will be hosting a VW swap meet this Sunday in Kansas City.  
As always I hill host camping at my house on Saturday evening.  Please let me 
know if you are coming and/or need directions to my house or the swap meet.  
Swap will be just south of downtown KC this time.
