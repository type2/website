&gt; Note, it IS IMPORTANT to run the
&gt;&gt; correct heat range.  A plug that runs too hot will cause pre-ignition which
&gt;&gt; leads to detonation, (there's a difference between the two), which will not
&gt;&gt; be a good thing for your engine.  It is the temperature of the plug that
&gt;&gt; causes the problem.  Not the construction of the electrode.
&gt;&gt; goforit!

&gt;Huh.  That is the first I had ever heard that. At my shop they have been
&gt;using the w8ac's on alll uprights as long as I have been there. The
&gt;dogma we spout is that they are the hottest available for that series.
&gt;
&gt;How could a hotter plug cause pre-ignition, since it still doesn't spark
&gt;until (assuming it is timed right) the proper instant at the end of the
&gt;compression stroke? 
&gt;-- 

 I beleive the plug glows so hot it causes a deisel effect. Back in my
motorcycle days I've seen bikes come in with holes thru the pistons from the
guy putting the wrong plug in. It just melted a hole right thru it. I would
assume this is possib;e in a vw as well.
