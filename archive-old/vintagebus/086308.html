Subject: Re: Insanity

 I'd possibly pay $500 if it was close to me.   It's in Kansas, so no.  $1500? No, that is too much.
Maybe they are just fishing.
 
It does have a decent rear bumper with trim, and an emblem, jailbars, deluxe trim, and possibly interior.
I'd pay $100 for just the rear bumper.
