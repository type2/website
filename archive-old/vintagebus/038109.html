In a message dated 98-09-13 03:51:04 EDT, you write:

&lt;&lt; If you paint the backs of your panels with POR15, they will become
 non-porous and you will not need the plastic sheeting. Paint the side
 edges too and be nit-picky about it! This is one job you can really get
 anal about!  ;-) &gt;&gt;
Hi Cal,
Without the plastic the water drops down the backside of the door panel and
seeps into the VW.  Then if the VW is at a sideways angle the water will
travel across the floor.  With the lower edge of the plastic inside of the
doors the water can only go out the drain holes in the bottom of the doors.
