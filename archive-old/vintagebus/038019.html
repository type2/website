I just did my 66, turned drums, new shoes, new wheel cylinders, new hose's 
front and back and a new master Cylinder(orginal single chamber) total parts 
just about 235.00 (I think your master cylinder is more). I was hesitant 
about replacing everything but man it stops like a 90's car!!!!!

ps its break dancing /brake shoes
