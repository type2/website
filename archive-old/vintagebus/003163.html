John,

Yep, that's definitely a deep sump.  Put in oil until the line reads &quot;Full&quot;.

Thank you.

Hey All,
Look at this photo please and tell me if I have one of those after market
Deep Oil Sumps on the bottom of the 1600 engine on my '66.  Whenever I do an
oil change, I put in the 2.5 quarts of oil and it always reads low on the
dipstick. I have always assumed that it was just the wrong dipstick because
the engine is a replacement from a '71. The I recently saw a 1500 engine and
a 40 HP engine that looked very different on the bottom and it caused me to
think (a very dangerous thing!) And if it IS one of these things, how much
oils should bo into the 1600? Anway, here's the link

Any advice is appreciated.
Thanks &amp; PEACE, John Baker
