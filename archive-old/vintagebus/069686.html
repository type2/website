Subject: Bug Blitz/Bus Blast, Memorial Weekend

Be sure to mark Memorial Weekend on your calender for one of the best spring
VW show and campout in the Midwest!!!

We have a new location this year with plenty of shade, nice grass to camp on
and air-conditioned buildings for the vendors.  Be sure to check the website
for details and directions:

http://www.mokanvwclub_dot_org/bugblitz.html

Some features (or reasons) to attend this year:
1.  Great VW camping both Friday and Saturday evening.  Last year we had
close to 50 campers, we hope for even more this year.  Plenty of good
campfire conversations and music.
2.  Wonderful VW show on Saturday, plenty of classes and trophies.
3.  Large Raffle going on throughout the show on Saturday, we already have a
rebuilt 1600 donated by Bugs and Buggies in Kansas City.  Watch the website
as we update with more prizes.
4.  Free food!!!  Friday evening food cooked up by the MoKan club, Saturday
evening will be a Taco feed served up by the Buskatiers.
5.  Free and Live Band Saturday night in one of the air-conditioned
buildings.
6.  The old town of Lawrence has some of the best historic sites and unique
shops downtown in all of Kansas.

Bug Blitz/Bus Blast will be a lot of fun and will be even better if YOU can
attend!!!!
