&lt;&lt; Well OCTO came and went with one great find. Eddie Van Halen! He showed
 up looking to buy a bus and seemed determined to buy the right one.
 Everyone around at one point went crazy and I will have pics up in the
 morning of the whole show so you'll just have to wait. How cool is that!
 Eddie Van Halen driving a 23 window! He's got taste. &gt;&gt;

Oh great!! Maybe he will buy a nice one owner orig paint bus and paint it 
like his f'n guitar!! And this is the last thing the bus community needs, 
when buses get popular, the fun goes away. Why does he want a bus now, cause 
Sienfeld has one?
