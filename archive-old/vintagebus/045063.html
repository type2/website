Ya- the &quot;cool tin&quot;  its much bigger than the little tins that clip under the 
cylinders and above the push rod tubes, and does direct the air for cooling 
if you have J tubes.   


I don't know if it does any good to use this tin on a motor w/ heater boxes.

&gt;  IF you haveever looked at a Safari/Thing 181 the ones without exchangers
&gt;  they have different cooling tin on the bottom of the motor.If you look at a
&gt;  motor with exchangers the exchanger is part of the cooling tin.Most of the
&gt;  vehicles for the Brazillian market had no heat.
&gt;  
&gt;  A friend of mine has an 1986 Brazillian baywindow doublecab with a type1
&gt;  motor,it is a deluxe model as it has heat along with a lot of other funky
&gt;  stuff manual choke carb,ice pick rear door handle,air 
conditioning,frameless
&gt;  pop out side windows and more
