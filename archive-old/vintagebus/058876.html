Subject: RE: [VB] NON vw 1500 muffler

  There are 4 different manufacturers of European mufflers out there (that I
have dealt with). 2 being  made in Germany and the other 2 in Denmark. I
have found that the Leitzritz (German) fits the best with the J and P
(Denmark) being second with the Dansk the most inconsistent of the 3 (people
will say the J and P and Dansk are the same, but they are not)and the Ernst,
the worst fit. I think the Ernst are made in Brazil and sold as German. As
far as import the southern country, the OEM Mexico fit excellent with the
OEM Brazil a close second, the aftermarket Mexico next and coming in a
distant last the aftermarket Brazil. The choice is yours.

Subject: [VB] NON vw 1500 muffler


Hi All,

I'm succumbing to the notion that I may have to put a non og muffler on the
tipper if I ever hope to get it on the road again.  Please don't think less
of me....... well, ok, I may have found an NOS 1500, VW stamped muffler but
just in case it doesn't pan out I need a backup plan.

I've poked around on the internet and have found a number of *German* 1500
mufflers ranging anywhere from $62 at WW to $49 from Larry Reno at
wagenwerks.  Can anyone tell me who's *german* fits better or are they all
the same manufacturer?

.... then again, maybe someone will make my day and tell me they have a good
used 1500, VW stamped 1500 muffler?
