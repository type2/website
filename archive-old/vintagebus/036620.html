I almost  hit a deer in my driveway the other morning.  Then  almost hit one 
the other evening almost dark coming home (going 40-50)  that sure got the 
adrenaling going.  Never actually hit one myself (touch wood), but my ex hit 
a deer when driving my 61 15 window,  dented the nose on one side.  The side 
other than where the PPO had hit a deer and bondoed and repainted it 25ish 
years before.  did I mention there is a nice crease from where it going into 
a ditch pushed the overrider against the nose skin?   Those hurst bumpers are 
kinda cool looking.  I could get a front one for that bus, put it on.  Should 
stop any more dents.

I wacked a deer with a karmann ghia one time, at about 40-50mph, at night.
Demolished the front end of the poor car.  I couldn't find the deer; he
either made it, or I flung him far enough that I couldn't find him.  Had
to drive all the way home with *one* running light, up Icehouse Rd.  You
don't know &quot;dark&quot; until you've tried something like that.
