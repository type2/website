talkings of hitchhiking unwanted critters, I also had a mouse living in my 
bug.  I dont know for how long, but when I had to buy a new battery, I found 
it live under the back seat.  It ran along the wir eto the starter, and poked 
it's head back through the hole to laugh at me.   I didn't bother to chase it 
off, as I figured it would just run back  where I couldn't get it, and I am 
sure it was hiding warm and toasty and would resist eviction.   Grommet?  hm, 
now the real purpose of the grommet  it realeved-  to keep the mice out!!!!!  
  Anyway, it proceeded to eat a hole in my formerly pristine glovebox (anyone 
who has seen this car will now roll around in a fit of laughter hearing that 
anything on it is pristine) and now occasionally small things roll out of the 
glovebox into the area under the hood.  Like all those 6V bulbs I pulled out 
of junkyard buses.   Then they roll down the compartment there and fall out 
the drip holes at the bottom front where the spare tire supposedly fits, or 
did until someone pushed things around with the bug.        But tossing bug 
bombs in my bus is just not my bag, man, would give me  a headache for two 
weeks, canary that I am.     And killing spiders is bad luck.    ZHm, does 
this have bus content?
