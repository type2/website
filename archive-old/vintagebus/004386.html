&gt; Repo dog legs are found at rmmw and ww, corners its best to used bay
corners
&gt; and modify them, to be blunt it sounds like they have no clue what they
are
&gt; doing or they would  know , you have to modify the repo dog legs to the
&gt; thick lips, i fab a section to do that, they also fit lousey and require
&gt; alot of reworking to get them in rite, male sure your not getting screwed
