Subject: new motor saga rages on!
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

i finally got the rest of my parts for my new
longblock yesterday. after talking with california
imports for two weeks or so, trying to compile a list
of everything that i need to make the motor turnkey. i
spent most of the day putting it together and i can
get gratification from it just looking at it sit on my
living room floor. i get my bus back from surgery on
friday or so. then it's reassembly. one question i
have, though. does anyone know a good procedure to go
through with a brand new motor? to give you some info
on it: it's a 1600 DP, it has dual weber 34's, it has
the later-style fanshroud and oil cooler, a empi
GT-style muffler, a generator, bosch 009, and a blue
coil. i think that's all the main stuff.

also, does anybody know of a good solution to
replacing a dormobile roof window seal? i tried the
&quot;cutting-a-late-rear-window-to-size&quot; approach. the
outer groove is too wide. i pretty much need something
that's equal on both sides one side for the glass and
one side for the fiberglass. here's a diagram of what
i'm thinking of:
