Subject: Soto guy....Unbelievable.

List,
     Wow, I only had to threaten with reporting him to the authorities
and he answered my e-mail the very next day saying that he would refund
my money if I would just send him my address which he should've had from
my last 4 e-mails.   Priceless.  My recomendation to everyone (which it
sounds like everyone already knows but me..) is do not send this guy
money for membership to SOTO because it may be the last you ever hear of
it.  Forget about the informative newsletter and shirt that never comes
as well.  I wonder how many people just let it go and Mr Heard continues
to pocket these people's $30.00.  And, if you're reading this David, I'm
still after you if I don't see that check. 
    Sorry to get off of busses for a second.   --JD
