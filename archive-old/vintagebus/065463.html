&gt; Also, get some thin plastic sheeting, glue it to the inside door frame, and 
&gt; trim so that it is hidden right underneath the door panel.  This will cut

Hi Volks,
That does help, but one must make sure the lower edge of the plastic is 
tucked into the door or the water will drip past the bottom of the door panel 
and onto the front floor rusting it out.  Additionally POR-15ing the inside 
of the door panels is probably not a bad idea for some of the repro panels 
(Like the pair of front door panels we bought for our 1960 panel walk thru 
camper conversion.) that seem to be more susceptible to warping due to high 
humidty even with plastic protecting them from the water itself.
