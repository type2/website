&gt;&gt; one gasket of each is the correct way to do it, but the small ones are hard
&gt; &gt; to find...This keeps the flow of the carbon going only one way, and it does
&gt; &gt; not begin to collect in the center of the manifold.
&gt; 
&gt; I think that the flow is maintained by the pressure difference between the
&gt; RH exhaust port and the muffler.  I'd always assumed that the small hole
&gt; gaskets were to restrict flow, but had never figured out why.  Does the
&gt; small hole gasket go on the right or left hand side?

George,
I posted this to the lists and you yesterday. Did you not get it?

''&gt; Hmmm, which are the correct gaskets, the big hole ones or the teeny hole
&gt; ones?  which goes where?
 
One of each: small hole goes on the left, large hole goes on the right.''
