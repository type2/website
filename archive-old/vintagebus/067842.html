Subject: Re: [VB] inside the aluminum case from hades

Ditto that. Who did you buy the case from? I want to avoid buying anything from this place. They
should have known better than to sell crap like this!

It is hard to believe that so much could be wrong with a block but the
bearings show symptoms of processing trash. That might be the least of
the problems from what I see on the photos.
Some folks in my local VW club run the aluminum blocks and got good
product and are getting good service ..../ possibly another manufacturer?
I'd be interested in knowing at what rpm the knock appears first and did
it come and go or just get worse?
