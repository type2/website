Subject: westy poptop and bows F/S

I am offering this to the list before The Classic and OCTO shows, I have a
Westy fiberglass poptop and all the interior header bows for sale. If you
ever wanted to convert your bus to a poptop nows your chance.. The top has 3
risers? but one needs to be repaired (reglassed to top), top is in good
shape but could use refinished, it's painted some weird color, the wood bows
need to be reglued at the joints but are otherwise perfect. I also have
available the inner gray seal, poptop seal and canvas (all new), staple
strip for the top is also included if I can find it by then. This top was
going on my DD but have been talked out of it by higher sources. If
interested call. Will delivery to Pomona next weekend or The Classic
weekend. Located in Lake Havasu City, Arizona, home of Buses by the Bridge
2001.
