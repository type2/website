There are two styles of 40-hp muffler.  Fresh Air and Stale Air.
Sounds like you have a stale air muffler on fresh-air heater boxes.
Or vice-versa.

Are the bottoms of your beater boxes flat, covering the area beneath
the cylinders?  That's stale air.  Fresh air boxes has the round 
ones that go under the valve covers.

Sounds like I need to upload a diagram or two...
