I have been reading with interest the comments about cold weather driving,
oils, etc.  The weather here in northeast utah finally turned very cold
(-30) and I have had some challenges with my 67 bug daily driver.  The
windows kept icing up on the inside from condensate, and I wondered if
others knew my old fashioned solution for this.

I learned this from an old timer back in 1972 when I was driving a 69 bug in
Idaho.  He told me that if I bought some glycerin from the drug store and
rubbed it on the inside of the windows they would not ice up.  When I got
tired of driving with an ice scraper in one hand all the time I tried it,
and it worked.

I just bought some yesterday for the current situation, and it still works.
So if anyone is having similar trouble give this a try.  Just rub the stuff
(it is cheap) on with a clean cloth.  If the window is really cold it may
not go on smooth at first, but rub a while and it will smooth out.  It helps
if the window is dry when you start, but it will melt the ice if it is too
hard to get off.

I am not sure what the chemistry is for this, but I think that glycerin is
related to the glycol in antifreeze.  Maybe some of the wiser people on the
list know more about it, all I know is it works.  You have to reapply it
after a few days, but a small bottle should last all winter.  If someone has
a better idea I would be interested to know.  Unfortunately, it does not
make the car warmer!
