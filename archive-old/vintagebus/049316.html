Our 1974 Deluxe Westfalia has this unit - stove is propane, I think the fridge ran off 12v or the battery.  We took the fridge out and replaced with an icebox - probably shouldn't have messed with a stock vehicle but we hated the fridge - didn't keep anything nearly as cold as the icebox.

the refrig. is propane-i'm pretty sure it had a propane sticker on the
inside of it.  i don't know how that would work, though.  this is NOT like
the 76 and newer style on the driver's side of the bus units.  this is
directly behind the passenger seat.  i also saw no wires going to it, but i
didn't look super close, either.

&gt; Unless has been modified, the fridge is 12v electric.  these buses have a
&gt; 110&gt;12 converter in the vicinity of the rear/side seat that would run this
&gt; on shore power.
