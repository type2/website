&gt; we disconnect it.  But i find the whole process of pulling the metal hose
&gt; and rubber hose apart rather messy.  Especially with new hose, it is
&gt; difficult to get up there and worse -- difficult to put back on after engine
&gt; is re-installed.

My solution for many years has been the following:

I replace the tank line with a double-thickness, double-webbed high temp
neoprene line, 1/4&quot; ID, that I run over to the left side vertical metal
area below the left corner of the tank, and drill out a larger than 1/2&quot;
hole in that metal, smooth the edges, and run the line into the engine
room. It attaches to a inline brass ball-type marine fuel line cutoff
valve with convenient handle (West Marine - $15.00), and then directly to
a fuel filter and electronic fuel pump mounted on that sides vertical
strut. Regular VW neoprene webbed line (6mm ID) then goes from that pump
over to the carb input, hung from the roof of the compartment with nylon
ties (2 or 3). West Marine also sells the thick fuel line. 

If you are more anal than me, drill the hole large enough to grommet it
with several inches of split fuel line wedged around the big line going
through the hole. No more metal fuel line to cut through by the fan
housing and start engine fire.

When I remove the engine, I undo the line at the carb, shove my two inch
folded on one end piece of copper fuel line into the end of the fuel line
and clamp it down with the clamp, and get on with the engine removal. No
fuel to worry about, no fuel dripping into my eyes under the bus while
fiddling with the clamp and the slipping screwdriver/ nutdriver. 

The filter and pump are mounted on the left side engine room floor, in the 
right side non-battery area ,out of the way, and minimizes the possibility
of pumping fuel onto the hot engine (engine fire). All the lines are
visible and easily serviced and checked.
