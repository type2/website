Hi Steve.  It can be done engine in, but you'll have to be patient and full
of nice thoughts.  Of course the first step is drain the tank.  Don't do what
I did this last weekend and try to put 9 gallons in a 5 gallon gas can.  The
neighbors are still pissed about the gas smell and dead grass.  You then have
to disconnect the fuel line from the tank.  Being really careful, unscrew the
threaded piece out of the tank.  You will have to make your own gasket, it's
not a big deal as long as you take your time.  Get the gasket material at
your local FLAPS.  Reinstall in reverse order of disassembly.

While you're at it, now is the perfect time to replace the rubber fuel line
you have in the system (is that what was leaking all along?).  I make rubber
line replacement an annual item.

bottom of the fuel tank at the connector valve thingy.  So I'm looking for
suggestions on how to remedy this problem before I start the neighborhood on
fire.
