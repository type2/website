&gt; Just in from Scott, the webmaster of SV2s_dot_com...
&gt; Unfortunately we got hacked.  Well, our site didn't but the
&gt; server it sits on did.
&gt; 
&gt;    During the downtime, we have upgraded our hardware so the site should be
&gt; nice and fast when it's back up. We've also upgraded all of the base
&gt; software which will allow us to expand our site considerably.
&gt; 
&gt;    We expect to be back up and running by Monday the 31st. Hope to see you
&gt; there soon!&quot;

sweeeet!  Good to hear that the site is going to be back on track soon.

I'll also take this moment to commend the site-typers as well as any member of their
background-brigade, whom may not be known, on a job well done; SV2s is one of the cleanest, more
functional, and overall well done VW sites that's on the web, to date.  Although I don't visit
frequently enough to be the first one to catch the mishap, I do often go there and have it linked
from my geocities site.

May everyone's new year be hacker, spam, and virus free!
