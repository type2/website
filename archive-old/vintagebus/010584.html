Subject: vent window latch source?
Mime-Version: 1.0

Well, I have finally decided to do something about the drafty '62 crewcab.
I replaced all the front door window rubber, channels, etc, but haven't gotten
around to replacing the latches for the vent windows, which of course leaves
them constantly about 1/2&quot; open. It's just too darn cold for that, so I was
wondering where the best source for those latches is? I've heard horror stories
of some of the repo's breaking after a couple weeks, and I definitely don't
want to go through the procedure twice. Any success stories? Sources? I hear
it's a fairly straightforward procedure to replace them- just drill out the old
ones, and re-rivet in the new...
Warm thanks,

--
