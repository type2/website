Subject: Two for Sale

Hello Listees,

    Its been a while since I have been here. Too much
wakeboarding has kept me busy. And speaking if which I
am buying a boat so I would like to free up some cash.

    I have two busses for sale. One is a 1960, 23
window deluxe. The other is a 59 crew cab.

    The delux is very straight, has some rust issues
behind the bulk head, dog leg, and behind the
passangers side back doors. I have almost everything
for this bus except door mirrors.... Everything else
is boxed and the bus has been garaged since I got it
over 6 years ago. The motor is a strong 1600 and runs
well, tranny is good with no slippage. Brakes need to
be bled and adjusted if driven. If restored this bus
would be beautiful. I also have euro bumpers for it.
And a spare gas tank and sender. I am asking 5000 and
have pictures. Oh I also have a full floor section out
of another bus for it and new corners as well. The
corners arent bad but I found some extras so I grabbed
them.

    The Crew Cab is pretty straight but needs some
front and back end work. Bondoed pretty thick in the
nose. I have a pristine front nose section for it
already. The bed is in great shape and has no rust
through it. The cargo door needs some rust repair. I
have no idea on the motor or the tranny on this bus as
I have never even turned it over. It needs some wiring
work before that will happen. I also have a side step
for it. I have pics and am asking 3500 for it.

     I would sell both busses for 7500 in a package
deal.... 

     Email me offlist if interested.

    I have current papers on the deluxe and and crew.
