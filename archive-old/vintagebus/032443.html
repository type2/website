&gt;I guess my feeling was that if one uses enough glue the silver stuff will

&gt;vapors cannot go where there is no airspace... at least not very easily i

========================&gt;
So you are attempting to make an air tight juncture between two 
surfaces; one of which is &quot;quilted&quot;.
That might be pretty tough to do, and if you fail, then you have 
&quot;encapsulated&quot; a bunch of small water maker pockets that will produce 
entrained condensation as the external bus skin temperature 
differentiates at a rate not in keeping with the interior passenger 
area differentiation.

BTW,
I removed the black cardboard rectangles from above my 1600SP engine and
replaced them with cut to size sections of the aluminum backed felt (space
stuff) I got from JC Whitney.
I glued the space felt in with simple spray adhesive, aluminized side
facing the engine.
I then installed cut to size pieces of aluminum sheet stock against this
material, and bent the holding tabs to keep it in place.

Next, I cut a section of the space stuff to fit as a bed liner under my
sleeping area. I bordered the cuts with duct tape, and laid the material
in, shiny side up. (Just as done with house insulation for best vapor
barrier results) On top of this, I place an old cotton mesh weave blanket
as an additional sandwich material.

WOW !! What a difference in sound reduction................ Big Time !!
