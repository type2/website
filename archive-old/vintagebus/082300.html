Subject: Re: [VB] Have to disable a bus

  After pouring molten lead into the case, and ripping out the wires, 
you could grind out all the Vin#s,  leave it a pick n' pull, and tell 
her she can pick it up for free there.

That would be a good April 1st gag



But seriously, I hope that 15 window gets saved!
