The Honorable List
    I am in need of the little squirters that go on the front of a splittie.
They look like little chrome tank turrets and I would like to block those 2
holes before the weather starts to pile up around here.  If you have the
whole water sprayer works that would be even better as I have none but I
need to get those holes covered and electrical tape is all I got now.
Thanks in advance as I know someone has got to have some for me.....PLEASE
