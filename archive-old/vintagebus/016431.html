I think you've over-simplified it a bit.

Home depot doesn't carry the correct stuff; neither species of wood,
grain or size.  You need European sized sheets to be able to do the
roof pieces, as 'merkin 4x8 isn't large enuf.  Also, you gotta give some
for the cutting and finishing.  RVB can be more specific.
