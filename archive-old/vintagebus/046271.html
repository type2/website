Sounds like bearing failure to me.  No amount of new gear lube
is going to fix that one.  Check around your local area for the
VW shops and find out where they get their rebuilt transaxles
from.   You might have a builder in your local area or you might
have to mail order.  If so, I can help or there are some companies,
such as Rancho, down in Calf. that have good reputations.
