&gt; A little rough and cut arches but it's a work truck for sure.

&gt; NQ

This is a perfect case of them really meaning that the rust is free. To call this a &quot;rust free&quot; truck and then show you all those pictures of the rusty bed
and rusted out rockers. Wow! I almost e-mailed them just make myself feel better, but anyway if you want a good laugh at a rust free single cab check it
out. It does look like a fairly cool ride. Especially like NQ said &quot;it would make a great work truck.&quot;
