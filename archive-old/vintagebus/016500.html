Subject: 36hp experiment, valve guide removal


Hi,

I am working on rebuilding a 36 horse power long block
for my '59 bus.  I will try to relate information and
lessons learned about procedures that I have had success
with and that I haven't been able to find much information
about in the archives.

On Monday, I removed all 8 valve guides from the 36hp cylinder
heads.  They came out cleanly with no damage to the heads.
After measuring them I will order the replacement guides and
valves.  This is a how I did it.

A few weeks ago, I related how I had glass bead blasted the
heads and how nice the valve seats looked and that the heads
are in very good overall condition except that the valve guides
are worn.

I have read various methods for valve guide removal.  I didn't
like the idea of drilling the guides with a step drill prior
to driving them out because I don't have a drill press and have
never been very successful at drilling straight holes.
Of the methods I read about the one that seemed best to me
was to thread bolts into the valve cover ends of the guides
and then to drive them out from the combustion chamber side.

36 hp valve stems have a diameter of 7mm which is different from
later VW heads for which the valve stem diameter is 8mm.  I went
to the hardware store and bought 4 8mm x .125 x 1/2inch long bolts
and a piece of 1/4 inch steel rod stock.  (in retrospect,
I should have bought 8 bolts and done both heads at the same time)
I used a 8mm x .125 tap to thread the valve guides from the valve
cover side down about 1/2 inch.  I used penetrating oil and 30 weight
engine oil to lubricate the tap.  This was probably sub-optimal but
it worked OK.  I think that dousing the guides in penetrating oil
may have also helped with the removal.

With the bolts threaded in place in the guides and most of the oil
cleaned up I put the head in a 425F oven.  While the head was heating
I cut a piece of the steel rod stock approximately 10 inches long and
cleaned up the cut end with a file.  Then I took the other, as yet
untaped, cylinder head and used it to set up my Sears Workmate to
clamp the head solidly, combustion chamber side up, and released the
clamp in preparation for the heated head.

After about 45 minutes (an hour might be better?) my kitchen smelled
a bit like burning oil but the cylinder head was hot so I used pot
holders to take the head out to the Workmate and clamp it in position.
Then, for each valve guide, I inserted the piece of rod stock in the
guide, set a heavy piece of steel on top of that with my left hand
and whacked it with a 3 lb. dead-blow hammer with my right hand.  Each
guide took 3 to 4 wacks (they were quite tight in the head) before
they popped out the bottom and fell on the ground.

The heavy piece of steel I used on top of the rod stock was the top
part of one of my jack-stands.  This worked perfectly for me but you
could use any nice solid heavy flat piece of steel for this purpose.

I like the dead-blow hammer (with loose lead shot in the head) because
it tends not to bounce and gives a nice solid thump.

The steel rod stock I used was soft steel and had a tendancy to bend
but worked OK in general.  A better solution would be to use a large
pin punch with a pin diameter of 1/4 inch or 7mm.  I didn't have such
a punch.  Perhaps the piece of rod stock I used could have been hardened
by heating and dousing with water but then I would worry about shattering
it.

Later I did the same thing with the other cylinder head.

After measuring the guides I find that 2 of them are standard size
with an outside diameter of 10mm and 6 of them are .002 inch oversize.
Fortunately, both of these sizes are available from Vintage Parts.
I plan to order guides and all new valves this week and will report
later on the process of valve guide installation, etc.

If anyone can tell me where I can get a 7mm valve guide installation
tool (VGIT) I would be interested.  8mm VGITs are easy to find so I could
buy one of those and have the 8mm end machined to 7mm or I can cut the
head off a new valve, and install the valve shaft into the end of a large
bolt to create a home-made VGIT.  I will probably try the latter if I
can't locate the proper tool.

Cheers,
