Subject: bleeder valve tweekage

Hey all,

Ben having a h*ll of a time trying to get my brakes ironed out.  Anyway went 
to take my front right bleeder valve out that I thought I over torqued 
yesterday...and it came out fine!  Upon putting it back in for another 
bleeding attempt, half of the metal donut housing around the valve broke off 
with half on the valve and half remaining on the backing plate.  Is this 
repairable or do I need to score a new backing plate!  It is now impossible 
to thread the valve back in.  I hope my dilemas offer some entertainment for 
the veterans in exchange for the lists priceless advice.

Learning as I go,

Eric
