&gt;&gt; Hi! There is a guy on the list, I believe in PA. He does transmissions. I
&gt;&gt; think his first name is Todd. I lost all my saved messages in a crash,
&gt;&gt; and now I need to find him, so i can get my 65 back on the road.


Thanks to all who responded! I can now hopefully put the bus on the road 
again soon.


Chris
