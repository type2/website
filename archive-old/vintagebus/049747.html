Subject: Re: [VB] generator polarizing

&gt;Hi:
&gt;Just installed my new generator.  Now I need to polarize it.  Can anybody
&gt;tell me how long should I do it or I don't have to polarize it at all(that's
&gt;what my FLAPS told me)?
&gt;Thanks,
&gt;Michael


From Robert Bentley '66-'69 Beetle Manual:

&quot;CAUTION-
Before it is installed in the car, especially after the armature or field
coils have been replaced, a re-assembled generator must be polarized to
give the pole shoes residual magnetism of the correct polarity.  This
residual magnetism provides the magnetic field in which the armature turns
when you start the engine.  In the polarizing procedure you run the
generator briefly as a motor.  The hookup is as folows: from the negative
pole of a battery to D- and DF terminals on the generator.  From the
positive pole of battery to D+ terminal on generator.&quot;

Curiously, Henry Elfrink does not mention this in his Volkswagen Technical
Manual, nor does Jud Purvis in Fix Your Volkswagen.

Autobooks' VW Transporter Owners Workshop Manual says:

&quot;It is possible for a generator to have reversed polarity due to crossed
leads or shortcircuits.  Before installing an overhauled generator, motor
it for a short time, using a battery of the correct voltage.  Connect
terminal F (or DF) to earth, the positive terminal of the battery to D+ (or
+) and the negative battery terminal to earth of D-.&quot;

Clymer's Volkswagen Servive Repair Handbook for Transporter 1961-1972 says:

&quot;CAUTION

Polarize the generator as described below BEFORE connecting any wires.
Otherwise the voltage regulator can be seriously damaged.

Polarizing

When either the generator or regulator has been disconnected, particularly
if the generator has been rebuilt, the generator must be polarized.
Polarizing ensures that residual magnetism in the pole shoes is of the
correct polarity; reversed polarity can burn out the regulator cut-out
relay contacts.

To polarize the generator, connect it to a battery of the proper voltage
(6- or 12-volt) as shown in Figure 3.  ['Figure 3' is pretty poor.  It
shows a line drawing of that appears to be a 12v generator, the type with
two unmarked spade terminals (big and small) next to each other in a
rectangular plastic molding.  The negative terminal of a 12v battery is
jumped first to the grounding screw on the generator, then on to the small
spade terminal.  The positive terminal of the battery is jumped to the
larger spade terminal.]  Note that the voltage regulator is completely
disconnected.  Install the generator as described earlier.&quot;

Well, Clymer starts out giving a somewhat better description of the reasons
for polarizing, but falls down in the execution, failing to tell the reader
how long to keep the wires connected, of even that they should be
disconnected at all!

The earlier Floyd Clymer Volkswagen Transporter Owners Handbook, Revised
Edition says (in the regulator replacement instructions):

&quot;Important: If a new regulator is being installed, connect wires as noted
above [normal installation connections], then remove the fanbelt and place
a jumper wire between B+ (51) and 61 for about 5 seconds.  This will cause
the generator to spin as a motor, establishing the direction of current
flow.&quot;

This last description seems flakey to me.  Note that he recommends jumping
wires around when the regulator is already connected.  He also does not
include this procedure in the generator replacement section, only in the
regulator replacement section, and he fails to mention the word
'polarizing'.  With the price of regulators theese days, I'm not ready to
take a chance of frying my regulator!

I am curious what the Bentley early Transporter shop manual says.  I just
ordered that expensive sucker ($59!!?!), but it hasn't arrived yet.

Anyway, between the first three sets of instructions, you should be able to
find your way.  Good luck!  :-)

P.S.  What does 'FLAPS' mean?
