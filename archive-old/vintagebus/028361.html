&gt; Had anyone noticed a significant degredation in performance when travelling
&gt; with a roof rack?
&gt; 

I got about 18mpg in my 65 kombi , 1600dp, 34pict3 carb with my
half-sized roof rack, tool box, and two bikes on the roof during my
mexico trip. I usually get 20 or so.
I'm thinking that there aint much you can do to make the
drag-coefficient of a split worse than it already is. 

Then again, there was a question of mexican gasoline.... and open
windows... but then splitty windows dont really drag that bad....unless
you take the whole frame out or open the vent wings..
