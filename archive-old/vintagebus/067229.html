RE: Arizona- Phoenix/Tucson Emissions...

If in the Phoenix metropolitian area go to testing on North Black Canyon Rd.
I-17 (East of the freeway) and (South of)Peoria.    23rd Ave?

As of 03/2002, testers at that location happened to be aircooled VW fanatics.
They mentioned that in testing, my 1967 Westy 1776 with dual Delortto 40's, if
they kept it in third gear with higher revs throughout the test that it would
pass nicely. If they either A.) were not familiar with driving that type of
vehicle and/or B.) shifted into 4th gear and even slightly bogged it- then the
vehicle would automatically fail. Without saying so they indicated that it was
theoretically possible to slightly tip the cards according to customer or
tester attitude. To cover thier butts I can say that I &quot;perceived&quot; that was the
message and stand to corrected if questioned.

They asked if they could keep it in 3rd and I agreed. What the heck, eh? It
passed with flying colors where as it had failed in the past.

1967 is the first year for Arizona's Maricopa and Pima counties (Phoenix Metro
and Tucson Metro areas) and must be tested every single stinking year. Testing
is progressively less frequent for newer vehicles.
