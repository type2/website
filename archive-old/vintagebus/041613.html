&gt; &lt;&lt; I am replacing my 30PICT1 on the 70 (suspect it has bushing leaks) and

&gt;  Next, how to adjust the beast?
&gt;  Adjusting the big idle screw on the throttle arm works to an extent, but I 
&gt; have to screw the thing in almost all the way.  And turning the idle mixture 
&gt; screw seems to yield no results at all (and yes, carb has been tanked and 
&gt; cleaned).  Let's not even discuss the great big screw lurking just next to 
&gt; it!&gt;&gt;

the screw on the throttle arm should be adjusted so that it contacts the
idle cam (in the unchoked position) _just_ before the butterfly inside the
carb touches the carb throat.  The butterfly should be as close to closed
as possible, but not touching the throat.

At this point, you adjust the small screw (fuel screw) on the left side of
the carb for
maximum idle speed, and then use the large screw (air screw) for correct
idle speed.  repeat these two steps until you get the optimum fuel at the
desired speed.  Then turn the small screw 1/4 turn clockwise to keep the
smog folks happy.

I haven't been able to tune out the 009 flat spot with this carb.  I'm
going back to a vacuum carb as soon as I find one in good condition or
learn to tune the stock dual-vac carb.
