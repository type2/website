Subject: My Day


&gt; Just wanted to keep you posted on what I've done for the past couple of
&gt; days.  We're going full steam ahead on the shop.  This involved removing a
&gt; tree so I rented a HEAVY lift from work and rose up to a height of 40' in
a
&gt; bucket in my back yard and lopped the tree off.  Making it even more
special
&gt; was that I towed it home with the bug.  It was so heavy that I spun out
&gt; trying to get it backed into the yard but by gum I did it.  Later my
friend
&gt; Eric with a Dodge Ram came by and I succumed to his offer to tow it back
to
&gt; the lumber yard.  Later a guy with a chainsaw appeared out of nowhere and
&gt; cut down the stump for me.  I gave him the job of hauling away the small
&gt; branches and I kept the logs for firewood.  He showed up this morning and
&gt; hauled it off.
&gt;
&gt; Since my friend Brian bought a Baja with a shelled engine for $275, I lent
&gt; him my engine.  We started at 11:00 this morning and pulled his engine
(very
&gt; very easy on a Baja) which puked 8 quarts of oil in a 20 minute trip.  It
&gt; was leaking bad!  The bug is in about the same condition as Rob's beater
&gt; yellow bug although Rob's is more mechanically sound.  We replaced the
input
&gt; shaft seal on the trans, all the tranny mounts, moved the exhaust over
&gt; (which is a near vertical stinger with a tractor flap on the exhaust to
keep
&gt; the rain out!), and did the whole shiftrod repair bit.  It's a beater bug
&gt; and will be fun to offroad in.  That's the plan anyway.  So I worked my
&gt; rear-end off today in the street by his apartment and while we are away
&gt; getting parts, a cop writes a warning for &quot;major car repair in the streeet
&gt; as per city ordinance.&quot;  Thank goodness for Brian's mother who stepped out
&gt; and said, &quot;The guy doing this doesn't consider this a major job - they'll
be
&gt; done in an hour - it's like changing a battery or tire.&quot;  Darn those cops
&gt; anyway.
&gt;
&gt; So finally after tracing down a BAD ground, finding a wire that fell off
the
&gt; starter, and having to push the bug around so it was facing uphill so as
to
&gt; prime the fuel pump, we finally got the bug running after nightfall.  This
&gt; is the engine that took my bus to Dan's house in KC a couple of years ago
&gt; and rode in Rob's bus to California - once it got fuel, it started right
up!
&gt;
&gt; So while we're working on the bug in the street this evening, my brother
&gt; stops by in the folks car and says, &quot;Can you help me with my Impala?  It
&gt; wouldn't start after work.&quot;  I told him when we were done, we'd go tow
him.
&gt; So we picked him after 10:00pm in my bus and drove downtown to tow his
&gt; Impala with the bus (which I already did with Mom's 1974 Impala a couple
of
&gt; weeks ago - darn those Chevys!)  Since I had towed the Baja earlier with
the
&gt; bus, the bumper at this time chose to brake a weld on the towing side.
&gt; Before I even got the chain hooked up, the bumper fell off in my hands on
&gt; the passenger side.  So we couldn't tow with the bus - all I had left was
&gt; the bug and it was at home.
&gt;
&gt; We went home, 4 grown adults pile out of the bus and into the bug and off
we
&gt; go back downtown (about a 2.5 mile round trip).  We lop the chain over my
&gt; ball hitch and onto Kevin's 1969 Impala with the 327 and we proceed,
without
&gt; any difficulty, to tow his car to the shop about 2 miles from the downtown
&gt; area.  The bug did great in 1st gear and 2nd was a bit much so we just
&gt; patiently poked along at about 2500 to 3000rpm in first and made it with
no
&gt; problems to the shop.  I suggested the battery might be dead so we went to
&gt; Walmart, Kevin bought his battery, we came back, hooked it up, and car
fired
&gt; right up.  He left it at the repair shop anyway because he's going to have
&gt; them replace the battery ends.  This car is so original, it has the
original
&gt; friction clamp terminals on it.  They suck.  They were just pinched on at
&gt; the factory - no bolts or nothing.
&gt;
&gt; We came home (the 4 of us - my brothers, myself, and Brian) and moved some
&gt; garage door panels, sawhorses, shingle ladder, antenna tower, and a fence
&gt; panel.  I took Brian home, came back home, wrote this and now I need to
&gt; clean up.  I missed church this evening but everyone understands that it
&gt; happens from time to time.  The main thing is not to make a habit of it.
&gt;
&gt; Feel free to post this around.  Alas, no photos as I'm too busy to stop to
&gt; take any.  TTYL.
