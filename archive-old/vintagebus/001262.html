Subject: Re: [VB] '54-'55 Bus crap FS/Wanted

&gt; &lt;&lt; The back of the lense is painted black and has a stud that comes out to 
&gt; mount it to the body. &gt;&gt;
&gt; Would that not be the forward side of the reflector, or are you mounting these on the front of your bus?  :)
&gt;
Yes, the reflector is mounted on the back of the Bus so the face of the reflector that faces toward the front of the Bus is black, effectively hidden when the item is installed.

Look through your stack,
Everett Barnes
