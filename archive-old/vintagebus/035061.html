Subject: 4,000 RPM at 55mph?
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com


With my new (old) tach hooked up and it says I am doing _at_4,000rpm's at 55 
mph.  I have small nut reduction boxes, unknown transaxle, and tires with a 
26&quot; diameter/12-1/4&quot; rolling radius.  The RPM reading seems waaaaaay too 
high.  Any thoughts as to what trans gearing would create this situation?  
Are &quot;Mountain gear&quot; reduction boxes big nut or small nut?

Thanks,
Dan
