if you are splitting the case anyway, i haven't had to use the special tool.   You have the case just about ready to split, right- all the tin off, heads ps, cs, oil sump circle under the motor, etc off, rightyou have the pump cover off and gears out, so undo all those nuts and bolts holding the case together, and then I use a piece of wood and a mallet to hit the protruding flanges on the case to split it a hair, one on top near the front, one opposite it near the oil pump.    with the case split a hair you can remove the oil pump easily.
