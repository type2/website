Subject: two old buses

Hello

We have a 1959 and 1969 VW buses.  I had a 57 vw beetle split tansmission
along with the 59 axels and reduction gears in the 59 bus.  Ran for alot of
years but was on the east coast this summer and the trani went out.  Scrounged
around for an old junked 65 transaxel and by mixing parts of the 59 with the
65 was able to make it back to MN.  I want to update the 59 with a new
transmission.  Have a 1600 DP engine, which I would like to keep but want the
highest gear ratio I can get to the wheels.  Also have decided to keep the
reduction gears.  Should I go with a new 65 trani with the 65 axels and keep
the 65 reduction gears or update that to a 67?  Does the 67 have a higher
overall gear ration for highway driving.?

The 60 van I am converting to an electric/sterling and would like the highest
possible gear ratio.  I am planning to get rid of the reduction gears by using
Bus Boys conversion, which will lower the back of the van by 3 to 4 inches.
Will then lower the front by using their axel lowering kit.  Also would like
to go with disc brakes on the front.  Anyone know where I can get a drum to
disc conversion kit.  Also anyone have any suggestions or concerns with this
project.

Thanks for any help

Dennis from northern MN
