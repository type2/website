&lt;&lt; if timing is related to the distributor, how do i know which distributor i 
have, is it stamped on it somewhere?  &gt;&gt;
Hi Kevin,
If you have a black painted distributor made before 1968 then it should have 
a oval shaped plate riveted to it with it's number.  If the plate has been 
lost so has the number.
Distributors starting about 1968 are silver colored and have the number 
stamped into the body.  Which when mounted in the engine might not be visable 
due to being on the forward side.   Eric&amp;Barb
