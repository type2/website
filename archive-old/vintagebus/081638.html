Subject: Re: [VB] re:tires

Here's what i'm running, and love them in a 195/75R14 size:
http://www.tirerack_dot_com/tires/tires.jsp?tireMake=Bridgestone&amp;tireModel=Dueler+A%2FT+D693&amp;vehicleSearch=false&amp;partnum=975SR4AT693OWL&amp;fromCompare1=yes

The speedo and odometer stay correct and the spare tire still fits in my
Westy cabinetry like stock. I was still able to get my bus stuck in a sandy
riverbed last summer, so they aren't unstoppable, but very much improved
over the tires that were on it when I bought it. I do a lot of camping in
the summer, so they are an added bonus for when we go off the beaten trail
to find our own secluded camping spot.

&gt; Take a look at:

&gt;
&gt; Seems that the smallest tire is a P205-75R15, Sorry about that if you have
&gt; 14&quot; rims. Looks like I will need to find something else to use for a spare
&gt; as these are too wide for the spare tire well behind my 2/3 front seat.
&gt; Anyone want to purchase an unused previously owned tire?
