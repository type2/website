Hi, All!
Thanks for all the wonderful responses to my original post. It's nice
to be able to vent my frustrations and receive feedback on the problems.
Well, I believe this one has ended with a victory of sorts...
I went ahead and sent a nice letter to the city code enforcement agent
about my bus being &quot;in the process of restoration&quot; and explained the
circumstances involved in the restoration and what I am doing and=20
asked for some &quot;leeway to enjoy my hobby&quot;.
It must have struck a cord, as the agent stopped by and we had a very
polite and productive conversation. He stated that the city considers a
restoration as taking no more than 45 days(where that figure came from,
I don't know, but...). He must have liked old buses as he simply said to
continue restoration and to contact him every few weeks with an update
about how the restoration is going (no time limit was given).  I was =
elated.
Maybe I just got lucky and had an understanding agent  ...no matter,=20
I am back in business!
Thanks again!
Oh, yea...for your enjoyment, here is the letter I sent to
the city code enforcement agent:
---------------------------
Dear Mr. ****

   I have received the Notice of Violation of City Ordinance #19-62 =
(copy attached) concerning the green&amp;white Volkswagon 'Bus' in my =
driveway at  ******.

I have also read the city ordinances, Sec. 19-61 through 19-66, in their =
entirety. =20

   I feel that Sec. 19-62  may not apply here as it also states &quot;This =
section shall not apply..to a vehicle being restored or repaired when =
reasonable progress is being made.&quot;  For your consideration, here are =
the facts: many Volkswagen enthusiast groups, one of which I am a =
member, have deemed the vehicle in question a classic and collectable =
vehicle. The engine has been removed and is almost complete in a total =
rebuild and restoration and will be installed late in August. As it is a =
older vehicle, some parts are hard to find and I had problems finding =
several of the parts to complete the engine rebuild, but that was =
recently accomplished.  The vehicle is on jackstands so work can be done =
underneath, such as cleaning, derusting, and repairs of controls and =
brakes.  The fuel tank was removed for cleaning and rebuild.  The =
vehicle has a tarp on the front to prevent further rust to one small =
roof area, until I am able to concentrate on the bodywork.  The controls =
and drive train come first. I also have current receipts to prove that =
money is being spent on this vehicle in an effort to save and restore =
it.

    I believe this fulfills the clause about &quot;when reasonable progress =
is being made&quot;. Please understand that what you  and the City of =
Stillwater may deem &quot;junk&quot; is not that to me and my fellow =
enthusiasts.it is a hobby and a love.  I also own, restore, and ride old =
Harley-Davidson motorcycles (these I keep in the garage!)  Restorations =
do take time.=20

    Something you may notice about the vehicle in question is that the =
tag is current.  I do this as a sign that I have all intentions to get =
this vehicle on the road.  What would be the logic of tagging a junked =
vehicle?  This vehicle was found last year and rescued from a farmer's =
field after sitting there since 1972. I applied for and received title =
to the vehicle in October of 2000 after much paperwork and legwork, as =
the original Oklahoma title could not be found by the State and the =
original owner could not be found.=20

   Please understand, Mr.****, that I am not trying to &quot;buck&quot; city hall. =
I am simply asking for a little leeway to enjoy my hobby.  I will =
endeavor to keep the yard and area around the bus looking good. You are =
welcome to come by anytime and inspect the progress of my restorations . =
 Thank you for your time.

=20
