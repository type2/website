Adrian,

Infinity makes one that would fit in there really well. It is a powered
sub unit that offers pretty decent low end. It will not give you window
shattering thump while cranking the Beastie Boys but it will round out
the bottom end of the 2112 Overture by Rush. Another option that I have
had good luck with are the Bazooka tubes. The amplified Bazookas are
pretty compact and offer really good sound for the amount of space they
take up. If you don't need the amplification I believe you save a bit in
length as well.
If you wanted to get really fancy you could do a custom fiberglass box
that fit the space perfectly and then you could probably do two 10's or
a 15 in there.

hope this helps,
Craig
