Subject: Wolfgang Disc Brake Conversion (or how I spent my Easter Vacation), Part 1

 Well, I finally decided it was time to install the disc brake conversion
kit I bought from Wolfgang International. I decided on this kit because it
allowed me to keep the stock wide 5 wheels, although the adapter sets the
wheels 1/2 in further out than stock (so I'm told). Saturday I removed the
stock master cylinder and installed the baywindow dual circuit M/C, using
the adapter provided. Installation went without a hitch. I used a Rabbit
reservoir (courtesy of Karl vonSalzen, thanks Karl). Some slight realignment
of the brake lines was required, but nothing major, and with a little
further adjustment I was even able to install the splash pan under the
pedals without modification. Well, that was enough exertion for one day.
Time for a beer and a nap.
