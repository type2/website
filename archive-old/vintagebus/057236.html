Subject: Re: [VB] Finding a bus on the west coast

The west coast is a big place.  You're better off finding
a candidate first, and then asking if there's someone in
the area who can check it out.

The best thing to do is ask for a lot of pix of the bus,
from all angles, top and bottom, before you send someone
on a mission.    And you need to be a stickler on the 
pix: I've found sellers will conveniently &quot;miss&quot; bad
sections of the car.  They they don't give you a comprehensive
set of pix, walk away.

&gt; I am loking for a pre-67 vw bus on the west coast. I
&gt; don't have any contacts out there so I have no one to
&gt; look the bus over to make sure I'm not getting a
&gt; lemon. I'm not able to fly out there either. Are there
&gt; any folks out there that can look a bus over for me
&gt; before I have it shipped? Thanks in advance for any
&gt; help.
