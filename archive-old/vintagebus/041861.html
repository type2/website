&gt; It's going to be a bit of a damp squib if it doesn't get better by the

&gt; are being a bit more mild-mannered about it so visitors to Euro should be
&gt; OK. I was planning to go to Vanfest but not now because I have no gas. In
&gt; fact I was forced to bike to work :-( 
&gt; 
&gt; What exactly happenend when you protested about rising fuel prices over in
&gt; the US? Is there much of a difference in price between states? Just
&gt; interested in how it panned out.

The politicians have made a bit of a show of talking about reducing gas
taxes and investigating the oil companies, but nothing is really done.
Our president has stated that he is doing everything he can to make sure
that heating oil reserves are full for the winter, but that is just to
prevent a big price hike right before the election.

Actually, I'm amazed that it took the Euros so long to figure out that
their governments are gouging them on fuel taxes and to do something
about it. Seems that a couple of hundred years ago a group of americans
became similarly annoyed about taxes and dropped a fair amount of tea into
Boston harbor.  Perhaps the French, Belgians, and Brits will follow the
tradition!
