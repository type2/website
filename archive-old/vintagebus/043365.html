&gt;Hi. I'm replacing some wiring on a 6 volt system, and plan to keep it 6v.
&gt;I was wondering what size wire I should use. I have some 12g which I
&gt;figure should be more than enough for most of the smaller stuff, but
&gt;what about headlights, and the starter? I don't want to use anything
&gt;that would not safely handle the load.

12 gauge is plenty for nearly everything on a 6v Bus.  There is a
fairly decent chart at http://users.utu.fi/slaur/awg_metric.html -
the first and third columns convert American Wire Gauge into square
millimeter cross section as marked on the VW wiring diagrams.  You
can get the diagram for your VW at 
http://www.vintagebus_dot_com/wiring/index.html .

I have listed the common metric sizes from the diagram for my '64
Standard along with the closest larger AWG number from the chart
mentioned above.  It is always safer to use a thicker wire (smaller
AWG number or bigger mm^2 number).

mm^2     AWG
 0.5     20
 0.75    18
 1.0     18
 2.5     14
 4.0     12
 6.0     10
25.0      4

The only problem with using bigger wire than you have to is that when
you get a bundle of said bigger wires, it may not fit in the same
places that the original bundle fit in.

As Eric&amp;Barb noted, using the correct color-coded wire will save
you and the next owner of your Bus lots of headaches.  If you can't
match the wire exactly, at least match the base color, and get some
colored electrical tape.  Mark the ends of the wire with a wrap of
the right color tape - in other words, say you're fixing the wire
from the flasher to the turn signal switch, which is black with
white and green stripes.  Use a black wire, and put a turn of
green tape and a turn of white tape on each end.  If you run
across a combination that you don't have the tape for (like
black with purple stripe) you might consider using a purple wire
and putting black tape bands at the ends.  Or, if you remember
grade school art class, use black wire and put red and blue tape
bands at the ends.   This still won't help if a wire breaks in the
middle of a run, but it will help identify the ends.

Most FLAPS carry an OK assortment of wire.  If you need to match an
odd color on your VW or just anything, try a NAPA store - they usually
have Belden wire (slightly nicer) in a wide range of colors and sizes.

I hope this helps!
