Thanks for all the suggestions. I ended up getting a group 24 battery
w/1 year free replacement, and I think 48 month warrenty. Works great.

I popped it in the bus and was off and running. This is after about 2-3
years of just sitting there so it was quite an experience. Lots of
squeaking and shaking.

I think the brakes and an eletrical clean up are in order next. The fuse
box fell out of place last night while I was driving around and I ended
shorting out a fuse just as I was pulling into the driveway.
