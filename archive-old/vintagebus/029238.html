&gt; Another minutia question, this one has to do with the 9 small hooks that hold up the mesh net in the rear above the rear deck.  Can someone tell me what color these are supposed to be?  Mine have been smeared with green paint, but they look like they were maybe black originally.  If so, flat, semi gloss, glossy???  If they aren't black then what?
&gt; 
&gt; TIA.
