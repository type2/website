Subject: Re: [VB] Converting Tank Size

I am sure that someone on this list knows more than me, but it seems I
remember reading that a Super beetle 15 gallon tank fits with very little
modification.

Subject: [VB] Converting Tank Size


&gt; How do I put a Bay window gas tank into my 1959 double
&gt; cab?  This would give me more distance on trips, plus
&gt; I can add a fuel gauge without complications.  Any
&gt; experience on the list?

&gt; My early bay tank holds just a skosh over 15 gallons.

&gt; &gt; Anyone know what size tank is standard equipment in
&gt; a '58 single cab?
&gt; The PO of mine said he put in a larger tank and I was
&gt; thinking Bay
&gt; tanks were 15 gallons.  I ran out of gas the other day
&gt; and when I filled up
&gt; I only could put in 15.  Didn't put in that much from
&gt; the gas can.
&gt; Anyone know?
