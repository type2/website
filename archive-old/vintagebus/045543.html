&lt;&lt; Nope, i think if the japanese/british want a bus bad enough to pay top
dollar for it AND pay to have it shipped to where they live thats their
privelege to do so. &gt;&gt;

I sold a sunroof clip to a guy in the U.K.
It was removed from a sunroof standard, skylight holes punched through.
Everyone bitched at the price I asked for it. 
I dont think ill ever find another one for sale I told them.
One day an english guy called, paid my asking price (EXPENSIVE), PLUS another 
1500$ to have it shipped overseas.
A trucking company came to my house, took it to the port, made a crate and 
sent it on the boat.
I wasnt going to STOP him from doing it. He too wants to save his bus.
I hope I get to see pictures of the bus after the surgery.
