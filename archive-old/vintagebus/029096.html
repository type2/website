Subject: Type IV Road Trip to Fresno VW Intelligencia

I mentioned a couple of weeks ago that I was heading up to Fresno for a
robotics training class and would be taking the '60 DC on its first real
road trip since the transplant of an upright converted 2L type IV.
Longest trip out has been about 90 miles round trip.  This was I guess
what could be called a medium length (one you don't do every day) of
about 230 miles one way.  I had a little over a 1000 miles on the engine
so I figured that it was time.

I hooked up with listees Harry and Karl and over the past week, I have
been exposed to basically a great time.  I hesitate to call the trip to
the VW only junkyard a junkyard but that was fun.  More old bugs in one
place than any person could drive in a coons age.  I know Harry has an
electric thing, but I have a suspicion that his next trip south to an
OCTO meet could be in a home brew powered bus.

I knew my DC was running rich and I've been fighting a false air problem
since I installed the CIS FI on the engine and the frequent trips to the
filling station were confirming my fears.  One of Karl's first comments
was something about my rich smelling exhaust.  Wednesday night, we dove
into it and not only got the false air plugged (rivet in the butterfly),
but got it readjusted, timed and back on the road.  Gas mileage to
fresno abt 12.5 mpg, fresno to LB, 19.88.  This is with covering the
grapevine, watching all the water pumpers blowing radiator hoses.

The engine is running better that I expected.  Smooth and plenty of
power.  Left Fresno today at 3:50pm and made it all the way to glendale
before hitting traffic at 7:20pm.  That's 210 miles in 3.5 hours with a
15 minute gas and soda break up in Tulare (its HOT in the central
valley)  That average speed includes slowing down for the 15 miles or so
of grade up and over the grapevine.

I got a lot of comments from those in the class when they saw the DC,
&quot;You drove THAT up here FROM Long Beach?!&quot;  was the most common.

Another piece of VW small worldism, Harry and I were talking and he
asked if there was a instructor  named Gary from Fresno State in my
class.  There was and his description matched Gary's.  The next day, I
walked up to Gary before class and asked how his '62 double cab was
doing.  He was confused and responded, &quot;oh is that yours outside?&quot;  (he
didn't have DC owner stamped on his head, so how would I know about
his).  I then asked about his battery powered bug.  Now he was really
confused.  Then I fessed up.  &quot;Remember that guy in the orange DC that
you pulled up to help while he was stranded?, I had dinner with him last
night&quot;.  Off we went yacking about aircooleds.

I could go on and on about Fresno, but suffice it to say that Harry and
Karl were great hosts and helped make what I thought was going to be a
nothing of a week into a mini vacation.  THANKS GUYS!

Tomorrow is bug removal day

Scott

BTW,
while in Tulare, I picked up a bottle of Jones Soda (multitude of
flavors) and there was a BW pic of an old bug covered in snow as the
label photo.  A browse to their site at http://www.jonessoda_dot_com reveals
that you can order their soda with your very own pics on the label.
Sounds like every bus owner should have a few bottles on the mantle with
a photo of their bus proudly displayed.
