Listees

I need to replace the metal on the bottom of my doors, and under the nose.
Have any of you used the Brazilian replacement metal for the lower 9&quot; of
the cargo doors, or the support panel and lower panel for the nose?

In particular, do the door metal parts fit very well. I've heard that some
replacement metal parts fit really poorly. What should I avoid?

Does anyone know of a source for these parts who has the sheetmetal in
stock (I need it quickly)?
