Subject: Re: [VB] Original, what does it mean?

I'm sure they're meaning that any replacement was done with original or
original-style parts.  My Beetle is original, not FACTORY orginial, but I
have only direct copies or literal replacement parts on it.  Sort of like
saying, the paint is factory paint, or the paint is an original color. 
Maybe sound the same, but are quite different.
