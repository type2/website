Hi all, I would NEVER do this under any other
circumstances...NEVER and I appologise for doing so
now but I would strongly warn dealing with this
seller.  His name is Tim Supriano I have bought a pre
`55 beetle sunroof clip from him and have a friend who
bought a front beetle clip.  They were extremely poor
transactions and we are lucky we walked away with
anything.  After he received our money he
disappeared...we had to chase him down at his work
address where he avoid calls as much as possible.  End
of the story 4 months later, numerous emails and long
distance call charges I got the sunroof clip.  It came
wraped in one piece of old washing machine carboard
and had come from a 'rolled'..yes you read that
right!...rolled beetle and the clip was near
unuseable...good for parts.  I paid $700 for that! :-(
was just happy to receive anything after 4 months of
chasing.  My friends front clip dealings came out even
worse.

Sorry for this negative post but just wanted to pass
the friendly advice onto fellow listees.

Tds
