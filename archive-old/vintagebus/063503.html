&gt; So what was decided as working the best.  I recently replaced the top door

&gt; Silicone Spray.  None lasted longer than an hour.  Any ideas???

Andrew,

What worked for me was to use wrap the seal with masking tape every six
inches down onto the window frame, and leave it on for several weeks - no
grease, no goop. This was recommended by the restoration shop that worked
on the bus. Several weeks later, I removed the tape, and the doors worked
with a bit of friction, but became normal after a short time.
