------------------------------------------------------
Was writ-----&quot;It's still always good to meet
listmembers in person.  It makes being 
on this list all the more fun, not to mention meeting
nice people with a common interest.
Long live the list, Buses and people that love them!&quot;
------------------------------------------------------

I second that!! Even with list members I had not even
met, they are willing to help out...Case in point is
list member Beto (Type2Guy_at_aol_dot_com)sending me a
Bus/Bug set as I could not find them locally. He sent
it to me without asking for the money up front!!  
Thanks Beto

Gotta love it.
