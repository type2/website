Subject: Dormobile Vents

Good news. :-)

I found my molds last fall to make new dormobile vents like i have been for 20 years.  I had been
told prices on molding had gone up but..... last week i got bids for a new run, and..... the
prices are approximately the same.

SO.... i am able to offer a new run of vents if anyone has broken ones or has been procrastinating
or i have told i am out.

vents come drilled or not drilled for original hardware, your choice.
they come individually or in sets.

Individual- $75.00 including postage
Set - $125.00 plus postage

They should be ready about the first of April and i am planning on going to Kelly park and BYOB so
could deliver if anyone needs them.

Thanks. 
susan
