Has it cracked on the inside?  Ie, around the big rivets that hold
the door to the hinge?

I had the same problem with the '60.  I fixed it by supporting the door,
then welding up the area from inside the door, around the rivets, then 
welding the skin to the hinge on the outside.

Yes, I know this isn't &quot;factory&quot; and is very un-kosher, but I was much
more interested in having a strong, functional set of doors, than having
a perfectly stock appearance.  The only &quot;blemish&quot; is that I lost the
gap between the door skin and the hinge.

My doors are *very* strong now.
