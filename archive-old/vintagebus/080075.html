Subject: re: mission accomplished

Great effort! I agree that a job worth doing is worth doing well, but on the
other hand a bus on the road is better than one in the yard...I often
hesitate too long waiting for the right amount of time to do a job on my
VW's, but too often it is better to just do something, than do nothing.

I couldn't find you photo's of restoration...only the damaged photo on
vintagebus....
