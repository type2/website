That position can't be good for reception!  That is in
just about the worst place to get anything.  At least
mount it so part of the antenna is above the roof
line.  Unless, of course, you're doing it for looks
and nostalgia versus practicality.  Then again, most
people would say it's not practical to drive what we
drive, either.
