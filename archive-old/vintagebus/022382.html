Subject: My hoopty engine
Mime-Version: 1.0

Moved the fuel regulator out of the engine compartment today and put it
near the gas tank under the bus. This is where the filter and pump are as
well. I was gonna adjust the valves when I realized the smallest feeler
I've got is the .008....no .006. So that'll have to wait til tommarrow.

I'm still trying to get the timing and carb set-up right. I don't really
know exactly where it's supposed to be timed. It's a '75 case with a vac
adv disty and a 34 pict-3 carb. I'm really green in this area so ANY input
would be great. Right now it's at 10.5 BTDC and it SEEMS OK. I'd just like
to know where it should be.

I seem to be having trouble with my auto choke as well. I had it hooked up
and the engine starts right up. But it sounds out of time when it's
running. When it finally warms up, it idles seems to run fine. I ended up
wiring it open and disconnecting the wire. I don't know how setup the
choke. What's the procedure for that? Idiot book says to disconnect it.
Haynes isn't much help. My shop manual is for the older engines...not what
I've got. I had one list member say it needed to be hooked up. So how do I
set it up?

Thanks for any help.
