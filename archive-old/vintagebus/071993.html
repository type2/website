&lt;&lt; Got the engine compartment opened this afternoon and I am 99.9%
 sure that NOTHING was done to my engine.  No rebuild, no new case.
 My engine when I dropped it off had a fine layer of dust from the primer &gt;&gt;


well, did find where you wrote the engine number and check it againt the 
motor in the bus?   That's the proof in the puddin'.    It's stamped on the case 
under the generator stand or if not there on the top by the case seam.
