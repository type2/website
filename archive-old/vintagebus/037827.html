Here's a &quot;can't see it worth a damn&quot; picture of Craig's '57 Deluxe off my site behind a truck he sold:

The rear wheel well is hidden by a tree, a few listees might not like that.  (heh-heh, inside joke)

Seriously, I'd sell my badass ex-daily driver '55 Barndoor Kombi for around $10K, with *all* my parts for it, including an extra 20- engine, Barndoor shop manual, NOS parts, etc..  I would then extend Craig an offer...
