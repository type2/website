I need to weigh in with Thom on this one and given the cost of the cooroloss 
you wouldn't want to apply it any other way.  However, my son, Christian, is 
using this stuff and although I haven't read the directions in detail he can 
and get back to you on it.  The stuff is really thick and seems to work 
beautifully for what Christians using it for but he is going down to metal 
for the most part and applying it.  If he doesn't post in on this one let me 
know and I will forward his P-Mail over to you but he is now on the list and 
should see this when he gets home from work later this PM (PST).

&gt;
&gt;For any type of rust preventative, you *really* need to get the paint out
&gt;of the way.  You don't put a band-aid on over your shirt, do you?

&gt; &gt; my rusted areas, which are small spots on the floor. Want to spray the
&gt; &gt; entire (sanded to 80) floor and the cleaned up rust (probably baremetal
&gt; &gt; spots) with one product, then paint to stock. Is POR or cooroless a 
&gt;better
