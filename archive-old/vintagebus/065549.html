Subject: Re: [VB] Distributor issues

Folks,

Look at that picture AGAIN.  That is a vac. dizzy, but it is rotated so
far left(retarded) that its a wonder it will fire at all. Look at where
the condenser is sitting! That vacuum can should be rotated at least 90
degrees counter clock wise to get even close to the ball park. 

Yes everything should work if its all lined up, but yours isn't. #1
fires at about 3-4 O'clock on the watch scale.  Reposition all wires
accordingly.  MAKE SURE you are at TDC for #1 and that the wires are
in/on the appropriate places.  Trust, me I've F'd this up before and
chased my tail for a bit.

I'd start there if it were me.  Then I'd time it the John Howard way an
leave it.  Ah...the ear is a wonderful thing...too bad my eyes are going ;-)
