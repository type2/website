I had one of our office staff carefully make a copy of the nice 53/54
manual. I didn't want to risk taking apart the '55 book and one of our VW
editors owns a nice copy of that manual. We also have two office copies of
the '59 manual. So I will doing some more Xeroxing of these other two
manuals that we have available to us here.

My current plan is to use these Xeroxes to see if I can come up with a
comprehensive early bus manual that covers all these years. Hopefully it is
do-able. I'm also hoping to spend some time on this during the last two
weeks of August when I'm out camping in my '81 on the Cape. The reason for
this is that I won't have a computer or phone to distract me, doing vintage
books is alot more fun than work, and I'll be camping with my good buddy and
early bus aficionado, Jim Phillips, who has a barndoor deluxe, a '55 camper,
a '58 camper, a '67 bus and a number of other VW project cars.

As you can tell these vintage projects don't really get top priority when
I've got manuals to make for Golfs, Jettas, Passats and currently, the Audi
A4. However, they are fun to do and utilize pretty simple &quot;camera-copy&quot;
technology to reproduce. In general I work on them in my &quot;spare time&quot; so it
can take awhile for it to happen. However, it does happen, as we have
increased our vintage offerings by 100% since I've been here. (We had two
vintage manuals and now we have four).

[...]

Thanks again and keep up the faith,
I really want to see us do an earlier bus manual
