&gt;
&gt;Someone in this thread mentioned a different way of setting the valves
&gt;which involved less turning of the engine.  Has anyone tried this
&gt;method and then checked the results using the &quot;traditional&quot; method?  I
&gt;wonder if the base circle of the cam is really that round?

I tried the lazy method on a brand new Brazilian case and crank then
checked the results using the 'traditional' method and the results
differed, so I reverted to the traditional method.
