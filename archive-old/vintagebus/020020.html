  I haven't seen the issue, but I was there with my blue 
and white '62. Had a really good time! Mostly american 
stuff but the two bugs in the drag races seemed to get 
the most applause and rooting! I guess people like an 
underdog - or so they think. 
  One of the bugs went up against a '64 Nova which was 
cool since my brother (Mr. &quot;no replacement for 
displacement&quot;) owns one. I got a great laugh at his 
expense when the bug beat the Nova with an 11 second 
run!!  Everybody cheered the bug on. The sound of flat 4 
howling down the track was mesmerizing, it seemed like 
the stands were in awe, all eyes glued to it...VERY cool!
  One of the drag bugs had on the hood: &quot;Youth and 
enthusiasm can always be overcome by old age and 
treachery&quot;
