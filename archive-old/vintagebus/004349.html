&gt;Gotta '62 Standard somone wants to sell me...it's a small window in the
&gt;hatch...has no engine....needs a total brake rebuild.  Several rust spots
&gt;where metal is rusted through but nothing that is too hard to fix.  He
wants
&gt;150$ for it...it's got all the interior all paneling and seats and
&gt;everything..everything on it is original 165000 miles on it and I'm putting
&gt;in a rebuilt engine.....Is it worth it?
&gt;
Well, if it'll help you out I'll give you $140 for the seats and then the
bus will only cost you $10. I don't even need to know what color. Sounds
like a deal now, right? Cool, drop me an e-mail and let me know when I can
expect them.
