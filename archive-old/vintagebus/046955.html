.. that's right, for buses intended to be exported to ancient Sumar, they came with an above engine access hole, but only the buses intended for export to Antarctica came with the access hole above the gas tank sender for the gas guage...

   Any regular US market or Euro market buses did not come with these holes, and they should be regarded as installed by a DPO.

 &gt; &gt; One of the PO's cut a really cool huge square hole above the engine, I
 &gt; &gt; guess so they could get at the engine from above.  I have found the
 &gt; &gt; panels to replace this hole, but on my '65 there is a 11&quot; or 12&quot; inch
 &gt; &gt; round hole above the engine.  Should this hole also be in an early '59
 &gt; &gt; or should the panel be solid.&gt;
