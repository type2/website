Hi Brain,
Up to about 61 or 62 the Westie child cot only used one round pole and slung 
the upper section of the front seat into a horizontal postion.  The round 
brackets mounted center above the front doors.
Then starting in 61 or 62 up to about 65 or 66 there were two round poles 
that had wider hooked ends than the later ones, to fit onto the round bar 
like brackets fastened to the body.
65 or 66 on used stamped half moon shaped brackets with the two round poles.
68 on were a U shaped cross section poles.  We are not sure if the hooked 
ends at this point got thinner.
Somewhere after 68 both U shaped poles where telescopic.  Possibly to allow 
installation in the pre-1968 Westies?   Eric&amp;Barb
