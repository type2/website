I was all psyched about breaking out of our self
imposed family seclusion and attending the Huntington
Beach Stationwagon/Woodie/Panel and VW bus show
&lt;Saturday, March 17th 7am-3pm&gt;.

Even had my wife convinced that our daughter was
totally able to travel. Had Paula prepped to be a
sport. Excellent humid overcast weather slated for
this weekend. Perfect for waxing/detailing the bus and
puck...

Then...
Realized that my new techno-classes start next Friday
from 4-9pm (in Phoenix). Damn! Have found that it's
nearly suicidal to miss the first night of a techie
class and/or drive all night to attend a California VW
event (from Phoenix) and fully enjoy it. Nearly slept
through two Familienfests doing that routine. I just
don't have that kind of reserve any longer.

I strongly encourage you all to go. Personally, I
*REALLY* want to check out that show and can't.
Hopefully a different flavor than the same ol' same
ol' VW bus show...
Oh well. Perhaps the September Woodie show/Santa Cruz
surf championships instead.
