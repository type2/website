Subject: Re: [VB] Clutch pedal removal

Hi Roger,
Did you:
  1. Remove the clutch cable?
  2. Take off the nut and the clutch cable lever?  Make sure to check the 
hole in the lever for wear from the clutch cable bolt.  We had that fail in rush 
hour LA traffic!
  3. Remove the clutch pedal from the clutch lever?

After all of the above it is a matter of swiveling the lever up/down and 
pulling the lever sideways to work it out.
