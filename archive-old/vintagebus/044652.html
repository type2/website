Hi John,
Might be possible.  Are you running without the thremostatic flaps?  What 
RPMs were you crusing at?  Yes, that type of sump plug sender is probably 
going to read low due to it's position in the engine.  How about buying a 
mechanical temp dipstick or one of those more modern temp meters.  Then you 
can calibrate the new temp sensor to boiling water and then check your gauge 
accuracy to at least the 212F point a sea level.   Eric&amp;Barb
