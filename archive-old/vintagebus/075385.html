Everything that's bolted on, and that you have room to store til you sell
it to us!

Popout windows with frames, wing windows with hardware, trim, door lock
assemblies, all bolts and small hardware, all front kick panel stuff -
9pin turn-signal box, turn-signal switch on steering column, ignition
switch, speedometer, all dash switches, fusebox, wiring and plugs for
headlights, pedal assemblies, knobs from heat control and e-brake, etc.

Consider saving all doors and hatch and engine lid - for sale to list.
Taillight assemblies, belt trim, you name it. It's needed by someone.
