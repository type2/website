Subject: Re: [VB] What ever happened to the five hundred dollar bus?

being somewhat of an ex-parts &quot;whore&quot;, i made an ok existence scouring the
country for junkyards to strip cars. i never had the $$ to do the entire
vehicle thing. some blame must be placed on the internet, obviously, and
the fact that there just aren't as many anywhere as there were 5 or so
years ago, not even in junkyards. 
i still don't sell parts for what people say they are &quot;worth&quot;, because i'm
still of the frame of mind i'd rather see people get the part that need the
part, rather than attend a swap meet and see what everyone has on &quot;display&quot;
for insane money. 
yes, money i make does go to tools and trinkets. i just got a practically
nos VW131A today via ups. it's a matra german bushing driver for bus center
pin bushings! can't wait to use it and try out that reamer! and that hazet
catalog never seems to go away...........
$500 busses/old vw's do exist, but $500 10 years ago isn't the same $500
today. plus anymore, most $500 vehicles are usually only good for parts.
unfortunate but true.

&gt; The extra money goes into tools, trinkets and NOS for the special
project, right?

&gt; The countryside is being scoured by the VW whores, who buy
&gt; all the buses out of people's back yards and turn 'em for
&gt; phat bank.  It's been happening for the last 10-15 years.
