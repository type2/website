Hello everyone,

In case you were wondering what happened to my friend
and his family (posted as &quot;URGENT PLEASE HELP&quot;) looks
like the oil pump quit on the new (4000k) motor in the 71
loaf he and his family were driving  while traveling
back to Petaluma CA from my house in Portland. After consulting
with the illustrious Mr. Bubble Head he decided to take advantage
of family member's AAA towing benefits and have the thing 
towed down to Ashland, OR  where he has friends and is able to 
barter mortgage loan costs for engine work. 

Thanks to everyone who called with advice/support, especially
MBH who took time out from digesting his Thanksgiving Pizza
to take a look at the bus. 

 
Jeff Golden
Portland, OR.
