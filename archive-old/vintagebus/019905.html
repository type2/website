Sounds like a possible adjustment issue or brake line issue.

I wonder if a pyrometer could be used to check the tem.

(ps: did you get the guages?)

&gt; passenger one SEEMS to be a tad hotter than the driver's side when i 
&gt; touch it.
&gt; 
&gt; I'm gonna check and make sure I don't have the brakes in a little too 
&gt; far on that one. Just wanted to see if there is some &quot;rule of thumb&quot; 
&gt; on this one...kinda like the dipstick test.
