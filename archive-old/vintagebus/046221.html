&lt;&lt; I'm wondering what this feels like. I've started to notice something like a
shudder when I shut the bus off. It's in the second after the key is turned
off. I have no clue what this is, but I don't think it's normal in any way. My
mind's eye says to think about that flywheel, but I kinda don't think that's
it. Don't feel anything abnormal with the bus running.
 
 Any ideas? &gt;&gt;

		Pull the engine and check.  It isn't that hard to do and if your right you
need to catch it quick.  I lost a flywheel about 10 yrs ago on my ghia.
Unfortunatly by the time I relized what was wrong it was too late.  The car
started shaking pretty bad only a block from my house.  I pulled the engine
and the gland nut had worked it way loose.  The 8 dowel crank and flywheel
were toast.  The dowel holes were wobbled and oval.  I had to tear down the
engine completly to get to the crank (obviously).  So PLEASE pull the engine
and check.  Worst thing that could happen is to waste an hour pulling the
engine.  Plus look on the bright side, concider it training for the next
engine pull competition. &lt;grin&gt;
