Shocks won't fix the problem.

Check:

* reduction box to spring plate connection
* tire pressure
* tire wear
* proper tire selection
* lug torque
* anything bent?

&gt;The back of our 67' bus is really loose.  When you turn it wants to keep on
&gt;going!  Thinking of air shocks in back and gas in front or heavy duty gas
&gt;shocks all way around.  Custom interior with a lot of woodwork so there's
&gt;more weight in back than usual bus..  Any suggestions  on brands or info.
&gt;pls help.  Also sway bar was mentioned to us.
