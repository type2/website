&gt;I looked under the back seat; it has the normal tubes running down from the
&gt;seat bottom but they aren't just clamped to the floor.  The outboard tubes
&gt;are each clamped to a gadget with a couple of levers on it and a longish
&gt;plate that is screwed to the floor.  It looked to me like the seat folded
&gt;in some way but I couldn't figure out how.




this is a Z-bed. i love them. seat looks normal (full width), but 
folds out into a bed. the company has some parts left, and will mail 
you instructions if asked nicely (they aren't very nice on the phone, 
tho).
