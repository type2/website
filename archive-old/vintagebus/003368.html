 Don't know why you had a problem Jon. You do have to wedge and push the
tank in. Once in it moves real easy. I made strap extensions with plumbers
tape. Never done a 59, only  57, 63, 64 panels. Ronnie has one in his 60
panel also. Just get down in there and kick the tank in. I even used the
hose and filler neck from the FC tank.
