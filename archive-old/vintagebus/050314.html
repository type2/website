FOR SALE:
A bunch of crap that's been sitting outside for a while.

3/4 Length Roof Rack for Bus
http://www.anet_dot_net/~mheld/Roofrack/Roofrack.jpg
Fits my '76, may fit splitties as well.
Originally white, now covered with an even coat of surface rust, but without
bad cancer. Minor dings and tweaks. Fully restorable. Does not include
tie-down clips. A stylish addition for anyone who wants to overload their
bus beyond a sensible limit. Makes parking garages an exciting experience!
Yours for only: $70.00

&quot;Best offers&quot; willingly entertained on all items.
Shipping possible, but not encouraged as its best to see these items in
person before buying them.
Located in Los Angeles, CA, USA, Echo Park area.
