Hey all,
        So....whats the story on the crescent moon looking indention that
can be found on pre'64 rear hatches?  I saw the most beautiful Double Door
Panel at BBTA last weekend and it had one of these hatches (got to ride in
the cargo area, too...very scary...no windows...and the driver was
intoxicated I think).  I had never noticed this before nor read anything on
them, either.
