&gt;&gt;&gt; with loose valves a clattering.
Loose valves not only cut down power, but as Stephen pointed out
earlier, a loose valve will not cool as well, because heat dissipation
onto the seat surface of the head will be lessened.&lt;&lt;&lt;

Think about this for a second......
A loose valve spends more time on the seat. Its the tight valves that 
burn. The loose ones are merely clattery power theives.
