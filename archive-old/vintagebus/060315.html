Bart-
You will need to install the oil tank
( 911 is dry sump system )
in the right rear corner. It's a snug
but good fit, and will have to be
notched in (remove the battery
plate) and relocate the battery
to the other side. You will also
need aftermarket air cleaners.

&gt; OK  Type IV's are all the rage now days. I have been wanting to go with a
&gt; 2.0 liter 914 for some time.  In doing my research I have discovered that
&gt; for about the same price I could put in a 2.2T 911.  Have already upgraded
&gt; my tranny in anticipation of the Type4.  No disc brakes, but have got
&gt; braided stainles hoses, new drums and there is no play in the pedal, so it
&gt; will stop.  Also have the new kyb air shocks all around.  My bus is ready
&gt; and I am pretty sure I won't have to cut for the oil sump.  Would like more
&gt; input on this.
