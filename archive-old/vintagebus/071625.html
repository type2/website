Subject: Re: [VB] guages - many questions

&gt; Oil pressure is higher when starting cold, warm idle about 10-20 psi,
freeway
&gt; about 40-50

Well, so far so good.  I got both my CHT and OP installed last night.  My
pressures seem in line with what everyone else has said.  This is good.
&gt;
&gt; only time I had a cylinder head temp sender was when I was doing the
cooling
&gt; tests for my physics project and I think it varied from 100C to 120C above
&gt; ambient, this was at ambient temps about 16C .  Depends on idle to
freeway.
My CH temps have been about 250 - 300F that is idle to highway (no freeway
yet)  I have a big hill to climb on my way home, so we will see what that
gives me.  How do head temps and oil temps correlate?  Or do they at all.

I am still looking for the best place to mount my oil temp guage, so if you
all have any suggestions (pictures would be helpful as well)   Thanks be to
all that have helped and answered my many, many questions.
