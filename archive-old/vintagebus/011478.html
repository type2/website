&gt; &lt;&lt;  The tranny in the '56 is fairly good;
&gt;  it's a rebuild by carters, although it's still a bit sticky getting thru

&gt; Hi thom,
&gt; The reason for your tranny being sticky is that you are using too high a
&gt; wieght of oil.  Which at higher temperatures the heavier oil has troubles
&gt; getting into the high tolerance areas.  It would be interesting to see what
&gt; 85/90 or 80/90WT Sta-lube would do.    Eric &amp; Barb

I was using 85/90 previously, and it was still sticky, and a lot
noisier.

The swepco is a lot thinner.
