Awesome report man.  The digital age is so wonderful - being able to send
live trip reports, pictures, etc.  I want to figure out a way to
cost-effectively transmit live video and sound to the net via a webcam.  If
some consistant way could be figured out on how to do this, we could all
virtually share in the events.

I just stumbled across an advertisement for a little $100 device that for
$10 a month, gives you a portable emailer.  It would be great to compose
reports while on the road and then send them off to a contact who could post
them on the net for you.  All it would require is that someone or someplace
give you access to a phone jack for a few minutes.

I love these trip reports.  Writing them ain't easy but the rewards you get
by knowing that you are satisfying hundred of hungry VW enthusiasts makes it
all the more enjoyable.
