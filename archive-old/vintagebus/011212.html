&lt;&lt; Hey all,
I have a 68 beam that I want to install in my 67 with 260,000 original miles 
on it's front end.
I need the straight dope on how much higher the bus will sit in the front 


.....

I had a 59 truck that had a bay beam in it when I got it.  It had all 14&quot; rims on it.  Yes it was noticably higher in the front, couple inches?  never measured it.  You could see a slant.
