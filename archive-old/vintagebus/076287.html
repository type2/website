Subject: Swiss Bus Travellers: update

The Swiss brothers (Patrick and Marcel) were here Friday and Saturday
night.  They were hoping to take a train to Alaska  but after we did some
research we found that is next to impossible.  They could drive to Prince
Rupert and take a ferry but the ferry only sails once a week in the winter
and they only had a few days.  So they decided to head back to Seattle and
fly to Anchorage instead.  The bus seemed to be running well, they did a
bit of maintenance on it here before they left.  They will be heading to
Montreal for the 20th of December (Sounds like a long cold drive to me) and
then plan to go down to Niagara Falls and New York.
Great Houseguests, really nice, positive attitudes...  it was great to meet
these two.
