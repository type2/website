&gt; Supposing Muhr is right, should I change the side trans seal also?
&gt; If so, can I go through without pulling the engine?

Hi MIZUTANI,
If there is tranny gear oil leaking around IRS joints the differential 
bearings of the tranny are probably worn out and just going to get worse.  
Slide under your bus and see how much the part that the inner IRS joints bolt 
to wiggle up/down, back/forth.  If you can only feel the tinyest amount of 
wiggle it's OK.  If it has so much wiggle you can easily see it the tranny 
needs a rebuild/replacement.  Engine removal is required for tranny 
rebuild/replacement.
