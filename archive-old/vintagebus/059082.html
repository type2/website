Subject: Time-Serts/Big-Serts

Thanks for the help, and that part number, a very good thing to have.
Three of the bolt holes on the passenger side rgb of my future
transaxle have been tapped 30mm deep for a 16mm (really it's a 5/8&quot;)
diameter bolt. The Time-Sert company is in Reno, maybe 2 1/2 hours
away, I am tempted to just go there busted rgb in hand and see what
they think. Isn't that a great excuse for a high desert in spring
camping trip?
