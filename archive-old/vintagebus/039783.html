for someone that is a &quot;list nazi&quot; and say's if the administrator of the
list is busy ,&quot;i'll step in and threaten to remove people from the list&quot;
and feels that way because they have been on the list since 93  you know
this doesnt belong on this list...you have been awarded 500 demerits and
cant threaten people for posting non VW related stuff for 2 years....8)
