Subject: [VB] Shipping from England


Hey all,

I'm having a tow hitch sent over from Southern England.  It will weigh
17.2 kg and measure 34X22X152 cm.  I'm getting a price of £50 (ouch) to
Southern CA via the British Post.  US post was a bunch cheaper, but no
office is near by the departure point.

Does anyone have any ideas of cheaper shipping methods??

I guess I'll have to pay it if I have to, since I can't find an original
one this side of the pond.

Thanks.

Steve
