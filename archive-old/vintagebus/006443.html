Hi folks-
My '60 bus dropped its fourth gear at the weekend.
still drives nice in 123.. but knocks the fourth out even holding it back -
jumps out and falls back - in a crash bang wollop.
gearbox and redux boxes are probably the quietest i've heard still.

not worked a gearbox before - and i'm assuming the thing needs a complete
strip down to fix - if indeed i could fix it, it'd take too long.

I have found a source for either a 63 complete back axle or a 65 --  the 63
is unknown quality.
the 65 aparently (one of them tales) came out iof a pranged dead bus in the
60s - so unless they toured the world in the bus in the fours years - it
looks like the one i'm going for --

compatibility question first then..  am i going to find it wont fit the same
as my 60?  assuming the 65 is a 1500 box my 60 would be 1200 and all.
if so is the 63 - from a big back window bus going to be right either?
the selector shaft has been gas axed off before the coupler (65)...  so that
needs replacing - will the shaft be the same as mine?......  is this in
itself a complete strip down job?....  how do i go about swopping this shaft
over if its the same?
if the shaft replacement is a strip down job... i may have to risk the 63
cus the shaft is there - its cheaper too.

obviously - the more expensive 65 box is what i'm having if theres no
problems to come.

more questions to come - but i need to know this fast - seller hot and
primed for a bargain if i can get it fast.
tia for any advice
