Subject: Photo of Green SC in Jackson Hole

I just got some photos of some shots I took in Jackson Hole around the first week in August.  I've got a nice shot of a green SC with a roof rack, white awning over the bed and American flag design on the emblem.  If it's yours and you want a copy of the photo, pmail me.
