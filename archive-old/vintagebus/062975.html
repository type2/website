Subject: engine bolts

i have my engine out now. the hole on the driver side top is threaded. this
is supposed to make it easier to install that bolt, due to the fact that you
dont need to be on both side of the bolt. the problem is-the clutch arm gets
in the way of the wrench-making for a very greasy, painful, and loooong time
trying to ratche this bolt in.

i was thinking of drilling out the hole-so it is not threaded, then just
having a nut inside the engine compartment. that way i could just slip the
bolt in, try to clamp a vise grip on it, then put the nut in from the engine
compartment side. this is what i need to do for the passenger side top. the
half moon bolt does not work with my starter/solenoid. i guess the 6volt
starter has a different shape.

does this plan make sense to you guys, or do you have any other
suggestions...

thanks
