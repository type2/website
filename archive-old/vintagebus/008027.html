I'm going out on a limb here with what limited info I have.

When you mail order a new tranny, they usually send it with a bug nose cone
since the bus ones are hard to come by.  If you had to replace the nosecone
with a bus one, then there is a chance that when you put it on, that you
improperly aligned the shift forks or hockey stick and as a result, have the
tranny locked in 2 gears at the same time.  Can you shift it okay?  If so,
then did you set the end play correctly with the thrust washers and fulcrum
plates?  A new tranny can be turned by hand - did yours turn by hand?  If
not, there is something wrong with the trans.

Sorry if I wasn't of much help but it's all I can think of...
