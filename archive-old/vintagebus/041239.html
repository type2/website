Well, 

I checked the archives and *they did* pull up the original post of Feb 8, 1998. I was a little skeptical then, as were some of the respondents to this post, but I've confirmed with many other non-scientist types that the substance I was referring to is in fact paint.

It'll take you a little while (like a day) to confirm or refute my suspisions. The paint is on the torsion arms right behind that torsion arm cover. I discovered this when I parted out a '65 bus; I took everything useable from the bus and was very surprised when I pulled off the covers and discovered the brown/red paint on the torsion arms was still wet, sealed inside the rear end, totally isolated from fresh air. Smelled like paint; felt like paint. Tacky, easily rubbed off onto something else, including your hands. I'm sure it's paint.

If anyone can prove me wrong, I'll send you an Internet dollar via e-mail. :) Joe
