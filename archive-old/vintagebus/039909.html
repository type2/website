I love the calendar idea though you are right about timing.  December could 
certainly be one of the decked out buses with lights... tastefull yet full 
of cheer kinda thing?  Other pics could be taylored to reflect the season 
and activities associated with them.  A SC or DC loaded up with pumpkins for 
October?  Course there is the October Fest approach also.  I like alot and 
would be happy to help in some way if any supposed talent could help.

Videos would be interesting but much more difficult.  I would favor pictoral 
spreads in detail for technical stuff in a step by step approach.  Offer a 
summary of the article with list member rating of what they saw and zip it 
for download to save locally to conserve on bandwidth from repeated 
accesses.  However, there is something to be said for a discussion/lecture 
approach which could offer much more depth that a pictoral method.  
Definitely something to think about!!

&gt;We (the list) could make one!  (Probably not in time for Christmas, knowing
&gt;printing companies, but maybe for next year!?)
&gt;
&gt;Also...we (the list) could put together a video of various buses with their
&gt;various owners doing things to, in, and around them....anyone with a video
&gt;editing station?  People could create &quot;articles&quot; on video...various
&gt;bus-related subjects, from fun to technical how-tos, and then they could be
&gt;woven together to make a special video (or series) that not only would we
&gt;enjoy, but people would probably actually pay for them at swaps/various
&gt;online sources, etc.
&gt;
&gt;Shut me up if I'm waxing geeky!
