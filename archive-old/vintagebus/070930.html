Subject: RE: [VB] My buses are going up for sale

My wife bought me my 59 double cab... which started my current
obsession.  I've been into cars all my life but that little gesture gave
me the go ahead to start (again) after a 6 or 7 year lull in automotive
dabbling through graduate school and starting my own biz (slim cash flow
with no time equates to no playing).  So now, I'm at 11 VWs and a shop
full of stuff.  I think she appreciates the oddity it gives us among our
friends and in our smallish community.  She very much likes to ride in
all the cars, rarely goes to shows, and never makes it into the garage
unless I drag her.  Basically, it keeps me out of the bars and the money
that goes into them is reasonably recoverable.  Hell, through these past
few years of economic down turn I'd say my collection has increased in
real dollar value while the money market cash that she has put aside for
the kids educations has done nothing but decrease.  I make it a point to
remind her about that every time a new set of wheels makes it onto the
front porch from the UPS man :-O

I think the big thing you need to do to appease a SO regarding any hobby
is to try and find someway for them to feel a part even if only minor
and to make sure time commitments don't over come *time for them*.  I
saw this thread last night after return from the Puyallup show (leaving
her at home) and I mentioned it to her.  At that point, she reminded me
just how lucky *I* was.
