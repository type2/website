&gt;The 2180cc is going to go in my '67 Sundial camper whenever the camper is
&gt;actually road worthy.  I really want to do some major traveling around the
&gt;country in the Sundial and was wondering if the 2180cc would be reliable
&gt;enough to make that happen.  Oh, yah, I also have a 1600cc dual port that
&gt;could work.  If anyone has any thoughts on hi-perf motors in busses, let
&gt;me know.

Cooling, cooling, cooling. The 2180 can be reliable, but it must be built
like a brick s***house. Even more so than a stocker, because the parts are
going to be harder to find on the road. The cooling system must be widened
to accomodate the stroker cylinders, fan shroud, cylinder tins, Kool-tins
and the leaks must be sealed up. A type IV oil cooler in a doghouse
arrangement is highly adviseable and keep the compression ratio down.
Balance the hell out of it, put a small sump on it, piece of cake. Of course
if it was me, I'd lose the dual carbs, but then I only like to set up a carb
once, not every couple of weeks. To each his own. Or, use the 1600.
