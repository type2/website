&gt; '70 1600 sp.  Feels like I'm on 3 cyl. but I checked all the plugs,
cleaned 'em, checked wires for broken ends (its happened), made sure coil
was all plugged in right.  Mechanic friend said check the fuel filter.
Changed it and tightened lines (little air leak next to carb).

Replace the points, cap &amp; rotor (particularly the latter). Do the easy stuff
first, the start thinking serious stuff like valves and compression.

Live fast, die young, leave a good looking corpse.
Oops, too late!
