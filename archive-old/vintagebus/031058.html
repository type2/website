Our gas gauge from a 74 bug speedo combination which we can read to a
gallon does change with low voltage / engine rpms, we have a generator.
We do have the little voltage regulator on the back of the gauge.  After
12.5 volts on the voltage gauge it is rock solid.  It follows that the
other could very a little with voltage.
PS you have been in a strange land with your gauges as of late
PSS this up down thought was the way we were thinking. good story JP

&gt;  And I was getting a bit over 21 mpg.  On the way back
&gt;  today, my temperature never got above about 220, and I
&gt;  averaged better than 25 mpg.  Break in the engine
&gt;  and it runs cooler?  Why the increase in mileage?
&gt; 
&gt; were you going generally uphill on the way there?      look idle- it reads 250.  rev it up - reads 190, let it idle, back
&gt; to 250. rev it up, back to 190.  boy it sure heats up and cools down fast.
&gt; why, I just dont trust those numbers.
