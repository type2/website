Subject: re: SV2s_dot_com

Just in from Scott, the webmaster of SV2s_dot_com...

  	&quot;Roger told me that some people mentioned that the SV2s website was down
(www.sv2s_dot_com).  Unfortunately we got hacked.  Well, our site didn't but the
server it sits on did.

	The SV2s website is on a server that is shared by a number of high profile
sites.  Some little scriptkiddy decided to spend his Winter break messing up
my life...These people were not very talented, but they were good enough to
get in to the box and mess everything up.  We decided to take the server
offline for a week, rather than risk having these losers attack other
servers through ours.
   During the downtime, we have upgraded our hardware so the site should be
nice and fast when it's back up. We've also upgraded all of the base
software which will allow us to expand our site considerably.

   We expect to be back up and running by Monday the 31st. Hope to see you
there soon!&quot;
