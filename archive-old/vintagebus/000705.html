Hi all, I have a 65 VW Martin Walter Dormobile that is entirely original but 
restored.The sleeping top not only is positioned differently than a Westy 
w/Dormo top it is also hinged from the opposite side.The Dormobile Club of 
the UK has a new website if anyone is interested: 
www.dormobile.freeserve.co_dot_uk.    For info there are 18 VW Dormies registered 
in the club. Of those 18 only 2 are splits and both are in the U.S. There are 
530 Dormobiles of other types[Rover, Bedford ,Romany,Benz etc.]  registered.  
   


Stu    65 Dormobile
66 Standard ,  67 Westy  and myriads of bugs
