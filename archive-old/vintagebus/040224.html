Hi all, I walked in from doing the morning chores to see (dateline?), maybe 
it was good morning america, but anyways, it was about this guy (who I think 
was islamic) and his wife was killed by a Timothy Mcvay (spelling?) bombing, 
and this guy, lives next door to where his wife (and he?) lived, and he left 
it the way it was when she died, and left her car as well, a 1969-mid 70's 
brown beetle!  I mean, it was sad, but it was cool to see the bug.  just 
thought I'd let everyone know,

see ya,

Matt
