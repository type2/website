a friend has proposed driving to Argentina from the US(texas), sometime next
year. another friend says impossible....you'll never make it through columbia,
and there are impossible deserts to cross...

he has an aircooled corvair van, and i have the '65 kombi. we are both
thinking that the vw would be better suited, due to parts being more easily
accesible, but his van's engine might be more durable....anyway i said i would
ask the list...

has anyone ever done something like this?
