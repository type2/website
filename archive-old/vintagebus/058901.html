Subject: A piece of busfullness

   On removing the rear bumper of a 67 Sundial (probally the nicest OG one I
have ever seen) there was a bracket between the 8 mm bolt and the little 4
mm bolt holding on the splash pans to the body. In all my years of busdome
this is the first time I have ever seen this little bracket. Another thing
that is there that I have never seen is a rubber drain tube on the driver
side battery? tray. Always learning new bits.

ronnie

ps. This bus is in for an engine compartment detail, new engine and trans.
