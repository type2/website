I like to pull off the bumper from the bus when I have to remove the engine.
It makes it a lot easier to get the thing out from under the bus :-)  I ran
into trouble when trying to pull the bumper off the Westy.  One, the driver's
side splash pan's mount to the body was spinning loose.  Two, the reverse
light wiring.  My Westy doesn't have the usual reverse light setup for '67,
it's got a set mounted on the bumper, installed by the dealer.

Some might remember that I posted to the list saying I had cut the wires,
thinking the lights a PO hack.  That's still true.  I was going to put it all
back, when I arrived at a thought -- why not put quick-disconnects on the 
wiring so I can take off the bumper without cutting the wires?  The thing is,
the disconnects must lie outside and exposed to the elements, because they will
not fit through the small hole in the body allocated for the wires.  I have
some &quot;insulated&quot; ones, completely covered in plastic that seem pretty tight
together.

Before I do this, does anybody have a better way?  I'm prepared to have to
replace these every couple years or so, but if there is a better solution...

It's just a single wire to each light.
