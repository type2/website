Subject: Garage Clean-up

I have the following used carbs - 4 28 PICT, 1- 28 PICT1, 1-28PICT2,
1-30PICT1 and 1-30 PICT2 that are surplus to my needs.

The thought of throwing them in the garbage is somewhat unappealing as they
could be used as cores for rebuilding. So if anybody has an interest in the
lot, I can be real flexible (and also knowing postage may be a factor). Let
me know if interested and we'll see what we can work out.

Thanks!

Scott
