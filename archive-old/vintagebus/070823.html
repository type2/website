Subject: bus (still) does not idle

List,

I spent the last few days removing the carb, cleaning it, putting it back on,
I even replaced the fuel lines ( they were old and nasty) The timing is
correct. The fuel cut-off is working.  Any ideas of where to look next?  the
bus starts and runs as long as you keep your foot on the pedal.  As soon as
you take it off, the bus winds down like you shut the key off.   The engine in
question is a 1600 DP with a brosol 30/31.  Anyone have any suggestions before
I give up and take it to the mechanic (I don't really want to.)

-Tom
