Subject: Parting out no-rust '60 Singlecab
Mime-Version: 1.0

I have found myself with a '60 Singlecab that I need to part out.  It is 
totally rust-free and solid.  Before you ask WHY I'm cutting it up, let me 
explain - in 1980, it was involved in a super NASTY wreck on the right 
front.  Someone started to section (ie hack) in the nose and right door
from a '67 
before they realized how bad it really was and gave up.  It has been
sitting ever 
since.  It's really mostly a shell, but the body is rust-free.  Don't ask 
for small bits like lights and switches, because they are long gone.  It's 
mostly sheetmetal, a rolling shell. 

What I have are: 

* Gates! - $350 
* Truck corners:  uncut taillight holes!  The right side is very nice, the
left needs more work, but both are saveable.  $100 right, $75 left 
* Treasure chest door - solid, with a couple of extraneous holes - $40
* Rockers, right and left - solid. - make offer, remembering that I have to
go cut the b*stards out.
* Bed - it's nice but I have no idea how it could be removed.  Plus you'd
have to come get it (and remove it). 
* '60 left door, good shape -$35 
* '67 right door - $35
* Front beam - drum to drum - make offer and come get it. 
* Steering box (needs rebuild, good for core) - $30
* Front bench seat, decent black upholstery - $40 

Sorry, the doglegs, lower nose and tranny/RGB's are spoken for.  Some glass
is there, but 
no windshields.  Anything else is pretty much up for grabs.  Small stuff I 
can ship, the rest you'll have to come pick up in Sacramento.  And you'll 
need to have some patience, as I don't have an unlimited amount of time 
available to spend cutting this thing up.  I can take pics of the stuff as 
needed. All prices are obo, of course.

Thanks,
