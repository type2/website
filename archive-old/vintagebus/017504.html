Several of you know that I have been tirelessly
marketing my very nice 1954 VW bus that no longer fits
our family's needs.
About mid-day (Tuesday) my wife called me at work to
inform me that I got a phone call from Japan regarding
the bus. The message on the machine was from a totally
unintelligible but overly polite caller speaking a
million miles per minute. WHY do any/all peoples on
this Planet insist on increasing the speed of speech
pattern when delivering complicated and
alpha/numerical information? All that I could make out
was &quot;I call from Japan, Please call right away- I
await your call. I saw your VW ad on internet, Very
desirable! You must email me at
adlfkjdskht49452u25_dot_com Send to me right away I wait
for message. Send FAX now to
#$%ddfki=e44w5456san_at_akdf=fj-$57^*&amp;$%_dot_com I honorably
wait for you.&quot; (otherwise totally incomprehensible).

After listening to the message for the first time I
knew from the root of my soul that I needed to save
that message!  I would play that message over and over
until the mystery was solved. I would sell this bus!
Save the message!

The phone msging svc at work uses 9 to
delete/disconnect and 7 to save messages.
Unfortunately I was calling remotely to my home~ you
guessed it... from work.

The lady on the US West/Quest
phone messaging service prompting message said &quot;End of
messages. To...&quot;

What did I do? In my haste, I immediately spiked the 7
key to save just as the lady on the recording finished
her sentence...

&quot;.._dot_delete the message press 7&quot;.

Instantly I saw my finger in slow motion coming off of
the key as the key returned to the UP position. The
room swirled, went dark and I heard the last climaxing
crescendo chord as heard at the end of the US version
of the Beatles song, &quot;A Day in the Life.&quot;

The USWest/Quest message lady continued in the
background, &quot;To save the message press 9...&quot;

Star 69 wouldn't work due to me calling remotely after
my call to the house and conversation with my wife.
There were other messages prior to and following that
message.

So if you or your clients are in Japan and trying
reach me please have them use email or call again and
speak s-l-o-w-l-y.

Slitting my wrists, ;-)

(If you'd like to make a call, Please hang up and dial
again. beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep...)
