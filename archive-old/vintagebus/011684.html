I have a lead on a '61 Crew Cab near Austin, Texas. I haven't seen it yet but have been told that it is restoreable, although there is quite a bit of rust. How complete? I don't know. If anyone is interested, let me know and I'll investigate further and try to ascertain condition, price, etc.

Russell
