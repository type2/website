Rob,
	The 009 dizzy should work without hesitation problems with your set 
up.  Try advancing your ignition timing.  Look for at least 32* advance 
running fast and see if you have over 10* BTDC at a slow idle.  On a low 
compression ratio 1600 sp engine I run 12*btdc at idle, via german 009.  
A big issue with the 009 is that those from Brasil often have problems 
and do not really represent the 009 very well.  A great SVAC dizzy that 
works fine on my dual port, pict 34, 1600 high compression motor in a 
'74 Super, runs poorly on my low CR sp 1600 in my '67 bus.   
Experiment.  Driving style and the use of your bus is an issue that is 
not universal.  Drive slow!  Gary Gibson
