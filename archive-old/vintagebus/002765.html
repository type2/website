Christian,

Thanks for the wonderful writing. Quite an adventure you took. Since I
live in California, I don't have a clear view of the political climate
in S. A. Things must be quite stable for a group to take such a long
trip on the open road. Can you enlighten us as to the political
situations down there?

Best of luck on the rally next year.

Chris

&gt; [trip report part 2]
&gt;
&gt; The rally organisers' mechanic, Eric van Rensburg, and his wife
Brenda took
&gt; us into their home and Eric gave me a corner of his workshop to work
in.
&gt; Eric runs an air-cooled repair and tune-up business from his home,
while
&gt; Brenda works in admin at Weiss Volkswagen, a Durban VW dealer and a
sponsor
&gt; of the rally. Weiss is that extremely rare creature, a VW dealer
with an
&gt; interest in air-cooled VWs.
&gt;
&gt; The next day, Sunday 2 July, I pulled the engine, and began the
stripdown.
&gt; The sump plate was a mess of white metal chunks, a very nasty sight.
The
&gt; heads were apparently undamaged, even though the spark plugs and
barrels
&gt; were blued from the heat. After the heads were off we found number
four
&gt; piston badly burnt on its bottom edge, while the others all still
looked
&gt; shiny new. Once the barrels were off it was clear that the engine
was indeed
&gt; seized on the crank. Number four small end bearing was also seized.
At that
&gt; stage I packed up all the bits and discussed my options with Eric.
He could
&gt; put me in touch with folks who could supply me with a used engine,
and he
&gt; also said that Weiss VW had a factory rebuilt 1600 single port
engine in
&gt; stock that had been ordered before the Beetle rally but not
installed in one
&gt; of the two Type 182 Kubels that Weiss entered in the rally.
&gt;
&gt; Since there was no guarantee that a used engine would get us back
600km to
&gt; Jo'burg we decided to go with the rebuild, even though I have a very
low
&gt; opinion of the local VW factory rebuilds, having suffered several
nasty
&gt; failures with them in the past. But Eric swears by them and seemed
surprised
&gt; to hear of the hassles I'd had with them.
&gt;
&gt; So I got the factory rebuilt unit, and thanks to Brenda's word, they
let me
&gt; pay it off over three months, and didn't charge a deposit for the
core, as I
&gt; didn't want to give them the cooked engine because it contained my
CW crank
&gt; and I still wanted the guy who built it to see it. Then followed two
days of
&gt; work, removing the SP heads from the rebuilt engine and fitting the
&gt; undamaged DP heads from the cooked motor. I also dismantled the
speedo and
&gt; lubed it up so it wouldn't snap the repaired cable again, and called
in an
&gt; auto electrician to sort out the remaining electrical problems. He
got the
&gt; warning lights working and showed me that I had been inadvertently
running
&gt; the bus without a regulator, since the alternator is of the external
&gt; regulator type. Between that and the bush mechanic's alt wiring,
it's a
&gt; wonder we didn't trash alternator and battery as well as the engine.
Oh, and
&gt; he also made a neat fix for the crusty main fuse connectors -- he
connected
&gt; a spade connector and short piece of cable to each of the main fuse
&gt; connections, and then fitted a Ford-type fuse to to the ends with
two more
&gt; spade connectors. Instant cure for overheating main fuse and a
must-do for
&gt; most old buses.
&gt;
&gt; Anyway, I learnt a lesson not to head out on a long journey in a
newly
&gt; rebuilt bus that hasn't been properly ironed out. But at least we
also
&gt; proved that you can completely renovate a bus in five weeks if you
have the
&gt; will.
&gt;
&gt; Once the bus was running again, we considered our options. One
possibility
&gt; was to rejoin the rally in an unofficial capacity, but we dropped
that one
&gt; pretty quickly. I wasn't about to rush anywhere with a new engine
and blow
&gt; that as well. So we chose instead to spend our remaining leave time
visiting
&gt; friends and relatives and doing some hiking in the Drakensberg
mountains,
&gt; after which we thought we'd make a slow trip back home to
Johannesburg.
&gt;
&gt; So we loaded up the bus and took our leave of Eric and Brenda and
chugged
&gt; inland, not exceeding 60km/h for the first leg of the trip, which
was only
&gt; about 50km to Hillcrest, where B's friends Barbara and Kenny stay in
a
&gt; rambling old stone farmhouse with 360-degree views from a commanding
&gt; position at the top of a high hill. Very cool people. The Zebra Bus
&gt; reawakened old memories for Barbara and she entertained us with
tales of the
&gt; many crazy solo trips she made in an old VW bus in her youth. Kenny,
a
&gt; master carpenter and cabinetmaker,  has an appreciation for old
machinery
&gt; and showed me his 1952 Vincent Black Shadow. The Vincent is a 1000cc
V-twin
&gt; British motorcycle of such outstanding engineering and design that
it makes
&gt; a Hog look like a traction engine.
&gt;
&gt; We spent a couple of days with Barbara and Kenny before firing up
the Zebra
&gt; Bus again and heading another 50km further inland via back roads at
70km/h
&gt; to Pietermaritzburg, where we spent another couple of days with my
cousin
&gt; Ingrid and visiting other friends around Maritzburg.
&gt;
&gt; Then we headed off again, still chugging along at 70km/h, into the
&gt; Drakensberg mountains for a week of hiking. We were planning on
heading home
&gt; after our time in the mountains, but then changed our minds and
opted
&gt; instead to return to Durban for the Beetle Rally prizegiving dinner
and to
&gt; hear all the stories about what we'd missed.
&gt;
&gt; By the time we returned to Maritzburg we had covered 1 000km on the
new
&gt; engine so I gave it its first service. There were chunks of white
metal in
&gt; the oil so I checked crank end float, to find a noticeable knocking
when I
&gt; pulled back and forth on the pulley. Hardly surprising, as the
engine was
&gt; supplied with a 0.5mm oversize pulley boss, suggesting the case had
been
&gt; align bored pretty wide ... Burned again by a Volkswagen factory
rebuild.
&gt;
&gt; Just as we headed out of Maritzburg I stopped by an
interesting-looking car
&gt; parts shop operating out of an old lock-up garage. I found this guy
selling
&gt; a treasure trove of used tools and obsolete NOS parts. Bought a
good, used
&gt; 46mm socket and asked if he had any VW parts or literature. I ended
up
&gt; buying four NOS Type1 camshafts (PN 113 109 015D and 113 109 021D),
as well
&gt; as two NOS Italian-made 34HP fuel pumps, all for less than the
equivalent of
&gt; US$70.
&gt;
&gt; Then we headed for Durban, driving flat out (100km/h) on the freeway
on a
&gt; warm windy day. When we reached Durbs I stopped and checked the
engine temp
&gt; (dipstick test), but it was running very cool despite being pushed
hard.
&gt; Next we pushed a little way up the coast north of Durban to Umdloti
beach,
&gt; where B's father had arranged for us to stay the weekend in a
beachfront
&gt; flat. Ahh, the lap of luxury after 10 days living in the Zebra Bus.
Our bed
&gt; in the bus was very comfortable, but several nights up in the
mountains it
&gt; was so cold we awoke in the mornings with the condensation frozen
inside the
&gt; bus.
&gt;
&gt; All the Beetle Rally folk were surprised and pleased to see us at
the
&gt; closing dinner, and we enjoyed the slide shows and story-telling and
&gt; prizegiving. Of the original 10 starters, there were five finishers.
Two
&gt; other engines blew, and one Beetle was rolled in Botswana.
&gt;
&gt; Then before dawn the next morning we loaded up and headed inland,
making for
&gt; Jo'burg by the back roads in freezing weather. As we passed the
Drakensberg
&gt; we saw it had snowed overnight in the mountains, and enjoyed crisp
views of
&gt; snow-capped peaks which we had climbed in warmth the previous week.
We had
&gt; to dress warmly in the drafty, unheated Zebra Bus, but the new
engine loved
&gt; the cold and sang sweetly at top speed all the way home.
&gt;
&gt; After a nine-and-a-half hour journey untroubled by any mechanical
problems,
&gt; we arrived back home in Johannesburg. We had cooked a very expensive
new
&gt; engine and missed the Beetle Rally, but we hadn't let it get us down
and had
&gt; still managed to enjoy two weeks of touring in the Zebra Bus.
&gt;
&gt; When we got to Jo'burg the new engine had developed a flat spot and
had
&gt; become very difficult to start. A tune-up revealed that ALL of the
valve
&gt; gaps had closed up. I reset them and the engine ran sweetly once
more. I
&gt; hope valves or seats weren't damaged by the overheating???
&gt;
&gt; First order of proceedings back in Jo'burg was to call my engine
builder. He
&gt; was surprisingly conciliatory and agreed that the engine failure was
&gt; probably due to a tight bearing or a blocked oilway, and in either
case that
&gt; would be his liability. He has the engine in his possession now and
will
&gt; hopefully strip it on Monday so we can assess the full damage and
discuss
&gt; the terms of his building a replacement engine. I'll keep the list
posted.
&gt;
&gt; And as for the over-bored end-floaty factory rebuild, I reported my
findings
&gt; to the parts counter man at Weiss Volkswagen and he got on to the
factory.
&gt; Their tech chief reckoned white metal in the oil is something they
are
&gt; liable for, but suggested that end float on the crank has something
to do
&gt; with a worn clutch pressure plate. I got his number so I could speak
to him
&gt; myself, but he was unavailable and hasn't yet returned my call. I'll
keep
&gt; the list posted on that one too.
&gt;
&gt; Next year's Africa Beetle Rally has been set down for April, and the
&gt; organisers have decided to reduce the distance to 4 000km, as this
year's
&gt; rally was too tough. I have been involved in planning next year's
route,
&gt; which will be entirely inside South Africa. But with some of the
stretches
&gt; I've included, the shorter rally will still be a driving challenge
as well
&gt; as a fantastic way to tour the country. Maybe there'll be some
listees on
&gt; next year's event? Check out www.beetlerally_dot_com for details of how
to enter
&gt; as an international team.
&gt;
&gt; Enjoy those ACVWs!
