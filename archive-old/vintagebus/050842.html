Subject: Re: [VB] Are you raising the front of your Bus?

Actually I am. I have a 60 crewcab that I am going to bring back up into the 
light of day.  Wolfgang in Redding totally rebuilt the beam with lowered 
spindles and DISK brakes, adjustable beam (you can drop it on the ground if 
you wanted too :) and all new german parts, bearings, wheel cylinders,  etc. 
Only 8k miles on it since the work was done. Got to be worth $600 plus your 
good beam to replace it. I prefer a beam that is correct for a 60 bus/truck 
with the dampener that attaches to the frame and maybe one that is 
adjustable because I want to drop it just an inch or so. This beam has the 
dampener that attaches to the beam. Located in Marysville just north of 
Sacramento. Email   vwbuslvr_at_saber_dot_net

&gt;
&gt;I'm looking to lower the front of the '63, and looking for drop spindles or
&gt;complete front end.. My 18 year old Son wants to drive away in the camper
&gt;this summer but wants it lowered first. The back already sags pretty good.
&gt;Anyone in Northern California looking to get rid of one?  Lloyd in Eureka,
&gt;Calif  Who wants his Son to drive away in a Splittie! Remember you never
&gt;forget your 1st car.....
