Subject: RE: [VB] VW denying their heritage?  More trademark stuff


I think the fact is that VW really considers AC their bastard child.
Since 1975 they have been trying to make it go away.  We are like fleas to
them.  A little bitty pain in the butt.  We don't fit in with their
wanting to make high priced very high tech cars.  I think probably the
engineers were tired of being looked down upon by the other big German
automakers for making the lowly aircooled.  They came back with a
vengance.  Too bad for us.  A car for the people?
Anyway we can be thankful that there are so
many people that try to keep us throwbacks on the road.  I don't care much
about the trademark symbol, as long as I can keep driving.  When they try
and take my bus from me they'll have to pry my cold dead fingers off the
wheel. They may have to do that to me anyway.
