&gt; I would certainly like to import these, as I am working on an interior
&gt; package which I plan to market later  this year, consisting of an oak
&gt; package tray, wood dash trim kit, console which really fits the bays and
&gt; a full underdash closure.

what I have seen but unable to find is an overwindow shelf for above the
front bay window, perfect place for maps and other &quot;things&quot; that you don't
want lost in a glove box.  if you or anyone knows where to find one, or
even the pattern I would gladly pay the ransom.

let me know when your other things are finished too
