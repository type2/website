&gt; The guy didn't seem to know buses, and I ended up with 1/2 of the
&gt; stuff for an early bus and half for a lagwagen.


This was Rocky Mountain Motorworks' fault.  I know this without a doubt
because I entered the order myself.  I ordered a pair of splitty door seal
kits, but they drop-shipped one splitty and one breadloaf kit instead. I
even went back later and looked at my order to them - sure enough, a pair of
splitty kits, not a single lagwagen part among them. Somewhere between
Motorworks order entry and Motorworks shipping department, the order got
changed.  Not that this changes the fact that the order was filled wrong
(which of course is ultimately my problem, since I'm the one who chose to
have Motorworks dropship that particular order), but unfortunately some
things are just beyond my control.  Okay, one solution would be to stop
dealing with Motorworks.  But then again, if I did, I couldn't be offering
door seal kits for $89. Check out my competitors' prices for the same kit
and you'll see the alternative.  So unfortunately, sometimes you have to
take the good with the bad.  And to be fair, Motorworks doesn't screw up
orders all that often, so this was the exception rather than the rule.

Now in the case of the front shocks in question, Dan did enter the order
wrong.  Plain human error, pure and simply.  The only reason Mari seemed
&quot;confused&quot; when you called was that she was surprised that Dan (who is
usually quite accurate) would have made such a mistake, and wanted to
confirm the error.  So even though the KYB distributor's book specified a
different shock, she opted to also check the KYB factory catalog just to
make sure.  Yes, both KYB books (and the Bus Depot computer) were correct
all along; Dan simply typed in a &quot;0&quot; instead of a &quot;1&quot; when he entered the
part number on the invoice (entering part number 4520 instead of 4521).
Simply put, he screwed up.  The correct shocks are already on their way.

It is regrettable, and I do apologize, that periodically an order gets
botched.  Sometimes it is an error on our end, sometimes not. The above are
good examples of one of each.  For every one that gets botched in some way,
a hundred don't.  Of course, if you're the &quot;one,&quot; that is little
consolation. We do our best...
