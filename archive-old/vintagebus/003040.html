&gt; I know this is an OTP but I think that in light of the recent discussions
&gt; here and there concerning the Texas 7 in Woodland Park, CO where Rocky
&gt; Mountain Motorworks is located, it might be of interest to you.
&gt;
&gt; My workmate buddy brother is a trooper in Colorado Springs.  He is also on
&gt; the SWAT Team and was called to duty to help with their apprehension.  He
&gt; put in 22 hours of overtime throughout the ordeal.
&gt;
&gt; Anyway, the part I found kind of interesting is that in the van that
hauled
&gt; the SWAT team members on site, one of the SWAT guys inadvertantly snagged
&gt; the pin to the flash-bang device and set it off in the van.  That guy was
&gt; the least injured - suffering ringing ears and singed vest.  The rest of
the
&gt; guys had hearing problems and various other maladies related to the
setting
&gt; off of an incedinary device in a confined space.
&gt;
&gt; I found it interesting to hear a story from the inside - one which we
might
&gt; have never heard.
&gt;
&gt; The ob-vw is that this happened in Woodland Park where RMMW hosts their
&gt; show.  I'm going this year - anyone else?
