Hello fellow listees,

Thanks to everyone that gave help in my search for cabinet trim.  Now I have 
a new problem.  I am currently in need of a water tank for my 67 westy.  I 
have never actually seen one out of a bus, but I know mine is missing.  If 
anyone has a lead on one or knowledge about a usable replacement, I would 
appreciate the info.

Thanks in advance for your assistance.

67 westy    (on the road again)
74 panel    (poor man's crisis)
