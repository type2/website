I'm posting this for a friend...so please contact him and not me!

I need to sell this bus today or tomorrow. I did a serious price drop. The 
bus is a great bus it wasn't supposed to be in america it was a german bus. 
It has a berg 1776 with weber 42 dcnf's on it. It also has safari windows 
and BRM's This is one sweet bus I need to sell to pay for medical bills or 
I would not be selling it. Please contact me if interested.  Asking $5000 
with the BRMs.
