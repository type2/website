Hey All:

I came accross a '66 Standard FS this past weekend.  Looks like original paint, I'm not sure of the correct paint codes and names, but it's white over teal blue.  The bus is pretty complete, no broken or missing glass, bumpers are there, missing the middle seat but the rear seat is there.  Headliner is there and in good shape.  Door panels in front and rear are all there, I think.  Wheel wells intact.  Supposedly everything works.  Minimal surface rust on the frame and chassis.  The body has numerous areas of body filler that have been sanded but need final prep or at least primer.  I'm not sure what was under there before, dings or rot.  From the interior there are no signs of deep rot or deep dents so I would assume dings.  Most of them are on the corners and front, a few on the sides.  The rockers seemed to be solid but I'd have to give it a closer inspection.  Cargo doors also seemed solid.  1600 SP ( I've been told) and fresh rebuilt tranny. 

Anyway, the current owner has had it one week.  His wife supposedly doesn't want it now after driving it once.  She's pregnant and it's &quot;too dangerous of a vehicle.&quot;  This guy isn't a *true* bus person so he doesn't know much about them.  Just wants to get his money out of it.

He paid $2,000, that's his asking price.   He wants me to try and help him sell it, like I don't have anything else to do.  But, people have helped me out so I told him I'll do what I can do.  If anyone is interested pmail me and I can give more details and hook you up with the seller.

Robert
