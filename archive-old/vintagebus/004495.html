It was a great event. Cybulski did a great job!

To all those that helped and gave input, I made it home! Three hour trip
took 8 hours but I did make it under my own power!

A great big THANKS to the club members from &quot;Good Old Volks&quot; from Kingsport,
TN. They stuck with me the entire slow trip home! Beyond the call of duty!!

Also a big thanks to Kurt Glatte and kids, and the Slaymakers. They refused
to leave until things were ok!

Thanks guys!
