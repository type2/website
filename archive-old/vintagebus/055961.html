Subject: Re: [VB] Steering box

&gt; &gt; I checked the net and some other sources and am looking at about $200,
with my core, before tax and shipping.
&gt;
&gt; Yup, they're pretty much the only game in town.  Bend over and squeal like
a pig, boy!
&gt; $200 bones is a LOT for ~$5 of new bushings, but you gotta grab the K-Y
unless you can
&gt; do it yourself.

Are the bushings the only thing that wears out? If so, how hard is it to get
the bushings? I have a press I can use to install new bushings.
