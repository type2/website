Subject: Whistling Heat

I removed the cancer pods from my heater system last year thinking I was
getting more than my Recommended Daily Allowance of asbestos and I can
really hear fan/exhaust noise through the heater vents, especially from
the windshield vents.

Has anyone else encountered this and more importantly came up with a
solution? I pitched the pods, so putting them back in is out.

Besides fixing that, I plan on tapping into the rear heater pipe below
the rear seat and run some tubing through the stock gas heater opening
in the furniture to keep my rear passengers somewhat warm. I considered
re-installing my BN-4, but my left side Kadron is occupying the space
required.  From what I've read, keeping the gas heater out my not be a
bad idea anyway.
