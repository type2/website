Subject: Re: [VB] New Listee Sticker Submission

Well, guys...I really like Everett's graphic.  I had done a detailed graphic 
that was similar and the vinyl guy had a lot of trouble with the details, 
since the stickers were small.

I am having 100 made to start out, and will have at least 50 for OCTO.  I 
would like it if some OCTO attendees would post comments once the stickers 
are seen in person. I am likely looking at selling them for 3 bucks....5 
tops.._dot_dependent upon the final price from the vinyl guy.  They are a two 
color sticker and have to be layered...thus the higher price.

They are approx. 5&quot; wide by 2.5&quot; tall.  Black and white.  They actually came 
out pretty cool because the windows are cut out so you can see through them.

I will finalize all the mailing/money info this weekend.  So keep you eyes 
peeled and I should mail some out next week.

I am really thinking about doing few various models (SC,DC,23,etc, etc)

So we'll have to see once I get a little more time.  First think is to work 
on the baywindow sticker for the type2 list.

I will keep you guys updated.....and If you want to see something 
different..let me know.  

Always open to suggestions...criticisms.....

Thanks for all the kind remarks...
