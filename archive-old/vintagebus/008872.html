I'm on the list (Aircooled.Net Inc.).

If it's &quot;OK&quot; to e-mail the lists, I'm all over it. I run a VW parts company
myself (Aircooled.Net Inc.)

However, I am the guy that bitched about getting SPAMMED; we have enough of
that already.

Perhaps the lists can provide a forum for list members to be added to
mailing lists where they have invited solicitations from VW parts vendors,
rather than having them forced on them (the argument of &quot;just hit the delete
key is #(&amp;#(^&amp;.

This is the whole issue of SPAM, and why it pisses people off. These lists
are information forums, not a place to get free and easy commercial
advertising, IMO. If it becomes known that we (the commercial
establishements) can freely e-mail the list members, the lists will
eventually become virtually useless as more and more small businesses (I am
one, right now) use them to try to &quot;catch up&quot;, and the &quot;big guys&quot; use them
to pepper the list members with &quot;deals&quot;.

Now, on the other hand, I am a VERY active participant of the RAMVA Usenet
group. I think the solicitation and information is much more tolerated by
CONTRIBUTING members of the lists or NGs, since they are members of the
&quot;family&quot; and not just coming in for a quick SPAM job, never to be heard from
again until the next one. If Wolfsden is an active contributor, then I may
have crossed the line. But, from the look of the list addresses, this wasn't
limited to one small group.

Now, I know this issue is going to stir up a lot of controversy, but it's
better to err on the side of conservative marketing, IMO.

Subject: mailing list question regarding SPAM


&gt; I have a question to the faithful members of the VW community.  I sent an
&gt; email out to the a few of the VW newsgroup lists of which I am a member.
My
&gt; question is this, did I just SPAM you?  Apparently, at least one member
&gt; thinks I did.  I am aware that conducting business via the VW lists is
&gt; against policy.  I've been a member of most of these lists for a couple of
&gt; years now, and have attempted to adhere to this policy to the best of my
&gt; ability.  I am also of the opinion that most listees welcome the
occasional
&gt; parts for sale, items for trade, or new products availability
announcements
&gt; that are posted.  When The Bus Depot announces that hard-to-find German
items
&gt; have, once again, become available, I applaud it.  (Ron, you can thank me
&gt; later for the plug ;o)  Or when new sheet metal becomes available through
&gt; Ronnie at Old Volks Home.  These guys notify people on the list because
they
&gt; are part of the &quot;list&quot; family themselves.  A lot of times, special deals
are
&gt; offered to list members only.  I know I offer discounts or free shipping
to
&gt; list members.  My earlier email was merely an offer to the list members
who
&gt; are not on my personal email mailing list.  I have this list specifically
so
&gt; I can send items specials, via p-mail, to those who are interested and not
&gt; compromise the integrity of the VW lists.  Unfortunately, my email may
have
&gt; been taken in offense.  I was told that I &quot;piss off more people than you
&gt; please by spamming them.&quot;  I was also told that any unsolicited email was
&gt; considered &quot;SPAM&quot;.  Well, I thought that being a member of a newsgroup
list
&gt; meant that you welcomed it's unsolicited email.  After-all, every email
you
&gt; get via the lists are &quot;unsolicited&quot; aren't they?  At any rate, I wanted to
&gt; pose the question to everyone out there.  If I've offended you or violated
&gt; any newsgroup policy, I apologize.  However, I'm sure the list admin.
would
&gt; have let me know.  Let me know what you think.  I don't want to make this
&gt; into another &quot;war of words&quot; on the lists, everyone knows we've had plenty
of
&gt; those.  So any comments can be p-mailed to me.
