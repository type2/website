Dammit, I knew I should have taken that advertising job in Yonkers, New
York, especially when they offered the restored '61 23-window as a signing
bonus.

Oh well, just another notch in my belt of bad decisions.

This is smart-ass Friday right?

 I received a call from some producer or something that is looking to rent
 a nice 21 or 23 window in the New York Tri State area for a show on the
 real bus vs. that concept thing.  Personally, I think they should use a
  Kombi or Panel or something that does some work, but I guess since everyone
 loves deluxes, they want that.  It would be for 1 day between the 23rd
and
 the 28th of April.  I have no idea what it pays.  All of you self promoters
 out there, this is your big chance to get the ol bus on TV, so call Tom
 Hayes at 212-486-3010.
