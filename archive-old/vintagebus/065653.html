Subject: Re: [VB] NOT a valve problem.

What is &quot;and gave me proper 'wipe' on the valve stem&quot; have not seen this 
  discussed before.
P &amp; C

 i suspect the lifter bore was at outside end of spec, and this combined w/ a .060 cylinder spacer


 and a heavy-duty spring caused just enough bind to bend the pushrod. the shimming of the arm


 altered stuff just enough to ease the pressure. and gave me proper 'wipe' on the valve stem 


 at 1/2 lift to boot! ironically, this was the ONLY step i hadn't done to the motor
