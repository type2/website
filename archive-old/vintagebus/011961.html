Hi guys!

After a two year hiatus, I&quot;M ALIVE AGAIN!  

And the '65 is almost on 4 wheels for the first time since November, 1993!

It is so red it glows. And the white is like pure light.  The only thing to
say about it is &quot;Oh my!&quot;

So all you show dudes get ready for the fights of your lives.

Cecil's back and he mad as hell!
