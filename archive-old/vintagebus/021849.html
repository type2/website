Thanks for the help!

I am 99% sure the sender is toast, but I am going to try the water bucket
trick to verify... Way too much free time on my hands :)

I converted to 12v and kept the stock fuel gauge and sender. From what I
have read this should not be a problem.  Since I did not get a reading on
the gauge I suspected the gauge was broke instead of the sender, so I got a
new VDO gauge....  And that did not read either.  Now I pulled the whole gas
tank and removed the sender.  Now I figure it was the sender the whole time.
I hope the stock gauge works when I put the new sender in :)

I was deliberating the bay window 15 gal switch...  But decided that my
stock tank is too nice to cut up and am going to stick with it.  Actually I
am high as a kite right now from the PUR-15 fumes from painting the outside
of the tank.  Seemed to be an industrial gray to begin with, but a very thin
application so a little rust is peaking through.  I will paint it gloss
black before I put it back in.

From my research on the internet oldvolks has the best deal on the stock
sender, but I wonder if it is German?  This is something I do not want to
change again, ever.  PITA!  Luckily the engine is out anyway for a head
retorque.

Thanks,
