Not sure if this got through the first time.  Sorry if it's a repeat.

OK, Here's my list:

1959 Westy SO-23, running fine.

1961 Flipseat Westy, 3.88 Freeway Flyer, I'm on my way to the shop in a 
minute to fire up the new 1776, big valve heads, 100 cam, (thanks Ronnie), 
dual baby Webers.  This engine is to replace the one I blew coming back from 
BBBV.  (Bad #3 exhaust valve!)

1961 Doublecab, originally 12V, now w/ '67 running gear.  Everyday driver.

1962 Panel, 6V, 40 horse, small nut trans.  Daily driver except it's in the 
body shop (seemingly forever) for extensive small rust repair and new 
original-like gray paint.

I gave my daughter the 1966 Westy for her college graduation.

1967 &quot;Grateful Dead&quot; bus.  Next project.  Hope to have it parked next to UJ's 
&quot;Bessie&quot; at Jerome if possible.  Maybe w/ the trans I won at BBBV!

1967 Riviera/American type camper (big picture window on the left).  Possible 
project, possibly for sale, possible parts vehicle.

1965(? - it's not that I don't know, just I forgot) E-Z(?) type camper.  Same 
as above, project, sale, parts.

And a few other VW-bus-shaped storage sheds.

Finally, my 1955 Ch*vy Panel Truck w/ a flatbed trailer that I haul these 
d_at_mn things around with.  Oh, yeah, a 1946 Studebaker flatbed truck 
(currently has a bunch of VW's in front of it.

There are more, but I'm going to go start the 1776!

PS the worst part is that everything that's running is registered and insured!
