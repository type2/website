Subject: Re: [VB] correct carb for 67 1500/scoops

I think they came with 30 picts.    But they should run fine with a 30/31 
pict.  Is there and issue with your carb?    They did come stock with a rev 
limiter, which keeps the driver from overrevving the motor.

re scoops, I think they are really ugly.  Are you having cooling issues?   
The best thing for that is to seal your engine compartent with new rubber 
seals, which really vastly increases air pressure in there and also the amont 
of air blown by the fan.  This is nice in winter (heat) as well as summer 
(cooling).  the other thing good for cooling is go to a doghouse cooler.

 owner)I even have the governer. sometimes it is fun because it 
 mechanically limits engine speed-in any gear. it will go 62 mph
