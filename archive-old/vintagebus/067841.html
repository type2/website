&gt; Some folks in my local VW club run the aluminum blocks and got good
&gt; product and are getting good service ..../ possibly another manufacturer?
&gt; I'd be interested in knowing at what rpm the knock appears first and did
&gt; it come and go or just get worse?

Craig's is the first generation of new aluminum 
T1 engine cases from the sole manufacturer,
Auto Linea Brazil. Theay have made significant
improvements since, (based on the profits they
made off Craig:)
