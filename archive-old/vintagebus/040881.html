&gt;
&gt;I noticed that my 65 double cab has 14 inch rims , are they
&gt;supposed to be 14
&gt;inch on a 65 , is that like that on all trucks?  because my 1960
&gt;has 15 inch
&gt;rims ,
&gt;help which ones are original , which ones are better , and what rims match
&gt;my speedometer .   john   thanks in advance

IMSM, 14 in. rims started in '64, so would be correct for your '65. They
should also be correct for the speedo, assuming that it is a '64 on. 15 in.
rims will give you a slightly higher maximum speed, maybe 15 in the back for
speed and 14 in the front for the speedo? No, wait, you'd have to carry two
spares or a bastardized rim spare.
