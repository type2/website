Subject: RE: [VB] Nerve shattering noises

[...]

A good and inexpensive source for miscellaneous relays, switches &amp; microswitches, motors, buzzers, etc. is American Science &amp; Surplus.  
&lt;  http://www.sciplus_dot_com/index.cfm  &gt;

===========================================

&gt;At the last swap meet I picked up a handful of OG relays, and also a
&gt;buzzer.  Some of those funny-looking one-windshield Buses have them
&gt;to let you know when you open the door with the key in the ignition.
&gt;
&gt;Anyway, it's a 111 951 307 A and has &quot;12 Volt&quot; marked on the side.
&gt;But it works just fine on 6 V.  I tried it all the way down to 4 V
&gt;and it still worked.  Makes a high pitched whine that is fairly
&gt;independent of voltage and that Muir called &quot;nerve shattering&quot;.
&gt;
&gt;Might be handy if you have a 6 V Bus and want a noise maker for some
&gt;reason - I've heard of people wiring buzzers in parallel with their oil
&gt;light for example.
&gt;
&gt;Unfortunately, the OG 12 V regular relays I got don't want to operate
&gt;reliably on 6 V.  They need about 8 V or so to work well.
