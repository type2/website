T-shirts for members of the Air-cooled Interstate Rescue Squad (A.I.R.S) 
are ready to be rolled out just in time for the Holiday Season.  The 
T-shirts feature the AIRS Logo (see www.type2_dot_com/rescue/main to see the 
logo and sign up) on the back and A.I.R.S. over the breast.  The T-shirts 
will be natural white and 100% cotton.  Sizes Available are S,M,L,XL, &amp; 
XXL.

Now the question that comes to mind is how do I order my AIRS T-shirt and 
how much is it going to cost.  Well all you have to do is send $14 per 
shirt (shipping is included) and the size(s) you want to:
