This takes forever, but it does work.  I did it once before I had the luxury of tools and when I had to have the engine in to get me to school the next day.  Get a comfortable milk crate to sit on and something nice to turn the engine with.  You do get tempted to just start the puppy up and then push it in.  Probably not a good idea though.  Good luck.

Richard
