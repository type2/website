Not willing to leave well enough alone, I replaced my windshield seals
yesterday- I got tired of looking at the amatuer-ish job done with
silicone everywhere on the front of the bus.  Low and behold, after
cleaning frame, and placing new seals in, drove to work in worst rain yet
and had tidal waves washing over me the whole way.  
I am thinking (?) I need to get some sealant inside lip and a bead around
outside.  I have at my disposal syringes to make this possible.  Can
anyone with prior experience help me out with a product and/or advice
before I drown?

Thanks,
Don Thompson
