 ...I believe that the crankstart was no longer standard equipment as of the sturdy bumper introduction, according to VW.  It could well have been an option after than.  But no it would not have been normal on a 62, even a European 62.  It is also possible that someone liked a crankstart and put it on the bus after it was bought, w/o informing their sister/niece/cousin of this.

&gt; &gt; Did the european market keep the crank  handle start longer? I've seen a 
&gt; &gt; european 62 that had one, and the little old lady who had it said it was 
&gt; &gt; original. She was not the original owner but one of her family members bought 
&gt; &gt; it new.
