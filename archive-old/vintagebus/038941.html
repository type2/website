I have found a bus an hour form me, a 79 claimiung to have a 1600 dp in it,
and a 4 sp, only needing a sunroof seal. I am about to take a look at it,
but want some thoughts on what that conversion would entail, and where I can
get a moonroof seal for a bus that new. She's cheap with a familair motor,
and currently running and inspected in my state, so she intrests me
slightly.
