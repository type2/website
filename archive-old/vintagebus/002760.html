Thom,

Thanks for the plug.  Since the subject was brought up I will now
provide an update on my progress. I have restored a couple of wheels
with my original mold and I am now making a hard mold that will make
the process much more efficient. The new price will be $275 outright
or $235 exchange. I am offering a listee price of $225 exchange.  If
you will send me your horn button, disassembled, I will also throw in
painting it to match your wheel. Contact me for the details. I will
have a production run of 10 wheels in about 8 weeks. Starting a new
business is full of dead ends and backtracking. I believe that I now
have found the freeway onramp and things should move along fairly
smoothly.

Chris
The Steering Man

All help
