Subject: Kabayo + chrome question
Mime-Version: 1.0
X-Originating-IP: 132.233.247.7

&gt;Kabayo
&gt;Had enough of being ruled by others?  Want to begin to regain lost
freedoms?  Check out the Libertarian Party at http://www.lp_dot_org, and the
Harry Browne for President campaign at http://www.harrybrowne2000_dot_org/.
&gt;
Since it's Friday, I had a question:

Isn't Kabayo slang for Heroin?  That would appear to undermine your position
as a proponent of an underdog political party.

Bus content:
On the scale of chrome quality, where does original Bus chrome rate?  I'm
curious what sort of quality is appropriate for a restoration. 
Triple-plating to be sure!
