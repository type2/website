Subject: Re: [VB] timing mark jumping around

I would replace the points first.

 I've developed a problem with my 67 Westy, 1600 DP engine w/PICT34-3 and 205M distributor.  It started
backfiring shortly after I tuned it up the last time and after tracing back through the things I had done I
came to conclusion it was the distributor.  I put a timing light on it and the timing mark was jumping all
over the place at 3000rpm.  I have since improved the performance by reinstalling the distributor and this
time making sure I had it seated all the way down, touching the clamp firmly.  The performance is holding
steady now but the timing mark is still jumping around within plus or minus 3/4 of an inch.  I now think the
distributor is the main cause.  Can someone suggest how to remedy this problem?  Do I need to replace the
whole distributor?
