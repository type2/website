&gt;I picked up a couple of Archer (Radio Shack) inverters at the last
&gt;&gt;VW show for $10 each. 
&gt;
&gt;My local Radio shack doesn't have any converters. 

They don't sell them anymore.  That's why I mentioned getting mine
at the swap meet.

&gt;The JC Whitney inverters cost $90, for a converter that provides 
&gt;26.5  watts, 6 volt input 12 volt output.  If I were to get this
&gt;type of converter, does that mean the radio I buy should only be a
&gt;25 watt/channel radio?

No, it'd have to be no more than 13 watts/channel into two channels
(26 watts total).  This also assumes that the radio is perfectly
efficient, which it isn't.  The practical limit is probably going
to be around a 6w/ch radio or so.  This also assumes that you will
have an inverter dedicated to the radio - no power being drawn
by your gauges.

You can't go entirely by the advertised wattage ratings, either.
Radio makers like to advertise &quot;peak power&quot; which can often be
double or more the average power.  The best way to tell is to
find out what size fuse the radio takes (add up the values of
the fuses on the main and memory power leads if it has both)
and multiply by 13 (12 plus a little slop) to get the maximum
wattage.

Just a thought...by the time you buy two of the mentioned inverters, 
you've spent $180.  This is quite a good start on a 12v conversion
for the whole Bus, or, adding a second (12v) battery, running the 
accessories from it, and charging it on a 120v charger at home.

I hope this helps!
