Subject: Re: Front Shift Rod Coupling: Why cut/weld rather than tap?

&gt;From: Claralw_at_aol_dot_com

&gt;
&gt;believe me, it is easier to cut the coupler than drill out the bolt.
&gt;The couple is fairly soft, for one thing.

I did this about a month ago on my '64.  I used a cut-off wheel in a
Dremel to make two lengthwise cuts (parallel to the shift rod) just
above and below the setscrew.  This left me with a C-shaped piece of
coupler and loosened it up enough that I could get the front shift
rod off.  Once it was out I made another cut on the other side to
get the C-piece off the front rod.

&gt;I had got a repro front coupler for my 61 (2 screw) from WW.   It 
&gt;worked, but the ID was larger than it ought to be.   For a piece of
&gt;pipe with a couple holes tapped in it for $8 I expected a nice fit.
&gt;Oh well, it did work.  Are the single hole couplers available?

Yes.  Pretty sure mine came from WW too.  The problem with mine was that
the ID was too _small_.  I slid under the Bus with it loose, figuring
I could just slip it over the front shift rod - no such luck.  Had to
come back out, stand the front rod on the ground, and tap the coupler
onto it with a hammer to get it on.
