Subject: Re: [VB] window seal fit? &amp; replacement ina 61

Here's my two cents worth.

When I replaced my Pop-out window seals, I had real trouble at first.  The
rubber would stretch in some areas, and therefore, be too loose in the other
areas.  I seemed to be forcing the Pop-out frame onto the rubber seals.  On
one side of the window, there would be a nice bead of rubber exposed between
the glass and the frame, and directly opposite on the other side of the
glass, the rubber would be pulled down between the glass and the frame, so
that the rubber bead would be 1/8 inch below the frame, leaving a valley for
water to collect.

I got a small paint brush and some anti-bacterial hand soap.  I know some
people use dishwashing liquid too but the anti-bacterial soap is thicker, so
it doesn't run as easily.  I painted the rubber on both sides real well and
the frames slid on pretty easily.  Then if the rubber was bunched up in one
area, (too big for the window), I could easily manipulate the rubber in that
area so that there were no wrinkles.  The rubber still wasn't perfect in the
corners, since the rubber that I got from Wolfsburg West is really just a
long piece of rubber glued together at the ends to form a rectangle.  I was
also able to move around the rubber in the corners so that it looked pretty
good.  Once the rubber isn't forced to stretch, it seems to fit pretty good.

Anyway, that's how I dealt with it.  Hang in there, be patient, and it will
work.

Good luck,
Ed

&gt;  &gt;[...] The WW seals seemed a little large and loose on the glass.
&gt;  &gt;Made it hard to get the glass &amp; seal in place- had to push really
&gt;  &gt;hard, but managed not to break any.  [...] Anyone have comments on
&gt;  &gt;these seals - or another brand that fit better?
&gt;
&gt;  I don't have any specific comments on VW window seals but I can talk
&gt;  about refrigerator door seals as I sold appliance parts in a previous
&gt;  job.  Ideally the door seals would be shipped flat on a big piece of
&gt;  cardboard the size of the refrigerator door, but that is bulky and
&gt;  expensive, so they are folded up a couple of times and stuffed in a
&gt;  long skinny box.  If you pull them right out of the box and try to
&gt;  put them on the refrigerator, you'll never get the seal to lay flat.
&gt;  If you dunk the seal in a bucket of hot water (not boiling, but pretty
&gt;  hot) first, it is much easier to work with.  Another option is to
&gt;  unfold the seal, tape it down to something, and let it sit out in
&gt;  the sun all afternoon.  A similar treatment would probably help
&gt;  with VW window seals, even if they are somewhat the wrong size.

&gt; these seals are sold as circles-   extruded rubber glued at ends into a
&gt; circle.  not crunched up.  the windows are much smaller than fridges,
after
&gt; all.   The thing is it seems that the circles are slightly too big.  With
the
&gt; rubber on the glass, it wants to pop off.  I squashed it into the window
&gt; area, but if the seal was slightly smaller it would not have been such a
&gt; bear.
&gt;
&gt; there is a metal area of the bus the window fits into.  the glass goes in
&gt; that area.  In between the glass and metal is the rubber seal.  seemed the
&gt; seal was too big.   I know the glass and metal window frame size had not
&gt; changed.
