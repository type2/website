Subject: Generator Light ON!  HELP
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

Just before I got to work today my generator light
popped on.  Pulled into the parking lot, opened the
lid and everything looks fine.  Belt looks gd,
generator spinning away, wiring looks gd.

Question is, how do I tell if it is a regulator or
generator problem?  Since the belt is still on and fan
working, am I going to hurt anything driving it 15
miles home to work on it?

As always, thanks.

Enjoy your day!
