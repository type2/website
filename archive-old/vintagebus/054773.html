Subject: Bustoberfest and VW pumkins

Don't miss out on one of the last VW campouts for the season here in the
midwest!!  This is a really fun campout with a group of great bus people.

The campout is sponsored by the Buskatiers, an internet based VW group with
members from coast to coast.  The &quot;club&quot; is not an old boys club as I bet
we have more women in our group by percentage than any other VW group!!
And at campouts, there are always a number of kids around too.

If you want to see some really cool pumkin carved busses, go to the campout
website at:

Hope to see some of you there!!!
