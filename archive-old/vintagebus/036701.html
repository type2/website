Hi list,

One of the things I read about in the Hoover sermons was about modifying a
Type 1 engine to run hydraulic valve lifters. Has anyone done this? If so
are the parts used in the conversion straight out of a Type 4 or are they
after market. 

As long as it wasn't an horrendously expensive exercise it would be very
cool not to have to mess with valve adjustments again.

Later 

Michael
