They're still threatening to apply some paint really soon on the '59 Westy, like this week.  Unfortunately I've heard that for the last 3 weeks.

We have decided to do it the *correct* way, i.e. paint the whole bus Mango Green first, then shoot the Sea Gull Grey from the beltline up.

One question came to my mind, that I never really considered before.  On two tone buses, is there a correct place for the two colors to meet at the base of the beltline?  On the sides of the bus and the rear hatch, it seems pretty straightforward; the seam of the two colors is at that bottom seam of the beltline, I'm assuming.  But what about the &quot;V&quot; on the front nose?  I'm guessing that *line* will continue into the front nose from along the beltline on the sides and just so happen to wind up in the right place on the nose.?  There's that small curve on the V itself where the lower color portion comes up to from the V, or the upper color portion.  The question is where on that small curve is the color separation?  Is it the center of the curve, the base of the curve, etc.  Is my question clear?  The other way to put it is:  Will it be obvious where the color separation is on the front V by following the line coming down the sides to the front?

Am I blowing yet another detail out of proportion?  I'm all ears for any advice, except from you Rex.  Rex loves to toy with my mind when it comes to this minutia crap I love to pontificate on.  I still love ya Rex!!!!
