Subject: re type 4 cooler

have lived and driven VWs in hell--{phoenix} for 20 years,--in around
100+VWs of all types--my &quot;new&quot; vw is a 64 doublecab with a complete gene
berg motor by clyde berg , built in 1996, sporting a 3.88 rancho tranny,
dual kadrons,--etc. fully balanced, previous owner said it ran a&quot;
little&quot; hot in his high altitude home?--valves were set at .04--might be
the problem--but a type 4 oil cooler is on the agenda for this truck, as
of now it has a deep sump, and spin off oil filter, running around a
total of 4 3/4 quarts of oil, previous owner was a certified vw
mechanic, his indication of running hot was the heat sensor in the dip
stick, that at a certain temp lights up your gen light--will i know the
inventor of this dip stick, even he admits there &quot;could be&quot; a margine of
error,-note, use an oil temp guage for the real story--when i have used
these dip sticks, all of my vws were running hot--but at least it IS a
warning light!! so that should get you to slow down--no doubt vw had a
great idea with the type 4 oil cooler,  use it, when ever you can--heat
kills!!
