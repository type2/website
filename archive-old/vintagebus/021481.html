 This is hopefully an easy question, but I could not find an answer in the 
archives.
 
 Does an early bay Z-bed fit into a split?  I think the interior code should 
be SO-44, the most common one, with the clothes cabinet next to the Z-bed 
with the yellow vinyl covers.  If I understand correctly the SO-44 ran from 
65 to at least 72.

yes.  I have one in my 61.  they are superior in their support system, 
actually.  and you dont need to put the trinagle bracket on theengine hump.  
go for it.  you just bolt it in at the floor with the seat type bolts.  So-42 
have the z bed s that go part way across and then have a blind spot cabinet, 
the SO-44s have the full width bed.
