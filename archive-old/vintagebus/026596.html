What I've seen done with these carbs before to remedy this is flip the
accelerator pump arm around... take it out...flip it..and reinstall.  you'll
know what I mean if you take a look at the thing.  I had this problem but
didn't want to monkey with it ...so off to the milling machine I went to make
my own carb adapter.  works pretty slick.  I use the long carb studs on it
that were originally used for governors (anybody want one?)  or you could
just take a governor (since nobody uses the damn things anways its not a rare
or valuable item) and stick it in there and adjust it so that it is so tight
it wont do any governing. hehe.  or take the brass guts out of it and stick
it in there...or cut the top off the thing.  either way...you get my drift.
all you need is about a 1-1/4&quot; lift...thats what I have... or whatever a
governor provides.  but that could be tricky as I assume your motor is a DP?
and that means a bigger intake manifold neck. so ixnay on the governor-eh?
but you get my drift.  mill yourself one out.  its kinda fun.  aluminum works
best for milling...steel gets kinda tricky sometimes...especially something
that small.
and don't even think of going to a FLAPS to get one.  they wanted to know the
diameter of my intake tube...and they laughed and said &quot;we don't have
anything that small nor can we order it&quot;  save yourself some
embarrassment...or joy.however you look at it....I just laughed at the truck
drivin dopes and thought &quot;at least I get more than 5mpg&quot; ;-)

YMMV
