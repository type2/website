Subject: RE: [VB] Advice needed-Deck Height. Short block-Shaved head


He problem is I will most likely need to leave this entire engine be, in
order to sue him. I imagine he would get it back after loosing, as
getting my money (hopefully) and keeping the engine would ential undue
gain in PA, so he'd have right to the piece of crap.
I do doubt the short block is crap (used parts, junk, etc), but I do
think deckheight is off from a block being decked, unless someone
actually shaved the head on the passside. Has anyone seen a head shaved
on a VW head rebuild, ever?
If I manage to fix it, I can sue him for the cost of fixing it, and keep
the engine, but I have a feeling it will be more than heads, I'll know
when I tear her down. I also fear teraing her down would reduce my
ability to recoup cash. I suspect I should have a pro shop do it to
document the issues, and act as expert testimony. UGH.
