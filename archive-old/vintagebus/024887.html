Its called Durasheath or Rmax and is carried by Home Depot.  They have a
bunch of
different thicknesses as well.
A link to look at the stuff is: http://www.rmaxinc_dot_com/products/p7.html

I had a look at this page, paying particular attention to the &quot;Warnings&quot;
and &quot;Limitations&quot; listed; and I would recommend others thinking of using
it do the same.  In general, it sounds like a pretty good product, but
is flammable, and designed to be used behind 1/2&quot; min. of gypsum (and
not in roofing applications at all), away from moisture sources, blah
blah blah.  I might use this product some day; but probably not in my
bus.
