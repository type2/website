Subject: Re: [VB] Forged or not

This is pretty good. Although I'm not planning on building a performance engine, it's still good
info.

One thing that baffles me is why they say that align boring a case will result in overheating and
low oil pressure. Align boring only increases the main bore in the case. The metal removed on the
case is just replaced with additional metal on the main bearing outer diameter. As long as the crank
journals remain standard, how would this reduce oil pressure or increase friction?

Do you think they are getting align boring confused with turning a crank?
