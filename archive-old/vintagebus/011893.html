&gt; &gt;A reminder: If you must (say if you are in East Armpit, Nebraska and
&gt; &gt;need to get out of town fast) use 195/75R14 tires you _must_ buy load
&gt; &gt;range D tires.  Load range C in this size has less capacity than
&gt; &gt;185R14 _passenger_ tires!
&gt; 
&gt; I find the entire tire industry to be Kafkaesque so this may well be
true.
&gt; Load rating spec for an early bay (splitty may be a bit less) is ~1500
&gt; pounds for comparison purposes.

Actually 1520 pounds, according to my '71 owner's manual.

&gt; In 185 the Yokohamas are around 1600 in
&gt; load range C, 1850 in D (the D is an 8-ply). 185s are not nearly so
easy to
&gt; get. I don't have specs for the 195s nor money for tires anyway but
&gt; whatever you get you want to be around or over 1500.

The 195/75R14 Load range C tire has a capacity of 1435 pounds, which
is a bit too low for my tastes.  I have a pair on the front of my bus
(followed the tire man's advice, bad choice!) but I wouldn't put them
on the rear, and certainly not on the rear of a Westy.  My theory is
that the lower-profile tire has to use more of its strength to
maintain its unnatural &quot;flat&quot; shape, so less strength is left over to
support the load.  The &quot;rounder&quot; 185 tires are more flexible and
therefore carry more load.  Note that this is a theory only!

&gt; As always you are not going to pop tires like this no matter what
you do to
&gt; them.

The major problem I've had is with tread ply separations in standard
load 185R14s.  Remember that the load ratings are the _maximum_
allowable and that you should run a comfortable (say 30-40%) excess
capacity.  Run the tires around at near their maximums and they will
give you trouble.


&gt; &gt;What French?  The last time I bought a set of XZX's for my D*tsun
they
&gt; &gt;were made in (1) USA, (2) Canada, (3) Taiwan, and (4) Belgium.  Yep,
&gt; &gt;four tires, all the same make and model, made in four different
&gt; &gt;countries!
&gt; 
&gt; Uh-oh. How many blew up and destroyed your wheel wells? 8) Michelin is
&gt; France's second biggest employer after La Cie.  &lt;-- Mac joke, leave me
&gt; alone!

None, actually, but a French-made one blew and reshaped the wheel arch
of my dad's C*evy van.
&gt; 
&gt; They go faster if you mount them with the white letters showing,

Dunno, I've never been able to drive and look at the tires at the same
time :)
