Subject: 40 hp okrasa setup for sale

before i put this stuff up on *bay, i would like to offer it to the list:
2 40hp Okrasa dual-port manifold heads... one exhaust stud was bent; was
removed, small crack filled, resurfaced flat and retapped.
this was done by a 30-year veteran of motorcycle, vw and porsche head work.
i do not see any cracks in the valve area.

1 set of 4 NOS 40hp exhaust valves - IVAM, prolly from early 70s
1 set of 8 valve guides, .005 over
(these are here just in case, heads look and feel fine, but i am not an
expert  head rebuilder)

COMPLETE dualport Okrasa standoff manifolds; these still have the original
red rubber hoses and metal clamps on the balance tube.
heads still have the manifold seals, in great shape

1 Okrasa COUNTERWEIGHTED crank - weights are not simply  welded on, are
integral - i believe it is a stroker 69.5mm  (i am not sure how to measure
this exactly, but the distance from the center of one journal to another is
roughly 70mm).
 bearing surfaces:
#1 54.72  #2: 54.84  #3: 54.77  #4: 39.71  rod journals: #1: 54.78  #2:
54.77  #3: 54.72  #4: 54.73
spec is 55mm #1-3, 40mm #4; 55mm for all rod journals.

EITHER 2 custom-built aircleaners (shown in photos) or 1 KNECHT round can.

photos are at:

this stuff seems to go for $800-1500 on *bay; let me know what it's worth
to you - i'd rather have it go to a listee!
