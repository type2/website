Subject: 67 master cylinder

Hello...

Hope someone can help me figure out what my master cylinder is on my 67
Deluxe walkthrough (vin 257076396)

First, the existing (bad) master cylinder reads &quot;VARGA 25IND.BRAS.VFCC 
IR 3066  0025-6&quot;.  Don't know if that will even help.  I don't have a
Bentley yet (would that even help?), but the parts catalogs I've looked
at say I should have a single circuit (one line coming out of it) master
cylinder.  The one I have has two lines - the front line T's off to the
two front wheels, the rear line T's off to the two real lines (T is by
nose-cone).

I've heard of people converting single-circuit brakes to double.  I
guess I need to know if this is stock or not and maybe a good parts
outlet to get a new one.

Thanks everybody,

Darin
67 Deluxe
