Subject: Re: [VB] Installing 40hp Muffler and Heater Boxes

&gt; &gt;&gt;  Do I need to fit it all together without tightening anything first?
&lt;&lt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; That is the best way.&lt;&lt;&lt;

Hey Volks,
I just wanted to say thanks for the advice on installing the muffler
on my 40h. I finally had a chance to get out and put it all together.
It fit nicely once I took the HEs off and installed them second. The
heat risers were a huge pain, but I kept my head so it went pretty
well.

All I have left is to set the timing once I verify TDC, then I can
fill her full of fluids and see how she goes, very exciting!
