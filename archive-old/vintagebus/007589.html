Now there have been a lot of talk about putting some extra lighting on your
Bus.  Some people wanted the original stuff but that tends to be pretty
expensive. Especially when you start buying things on eBarf. Here's what I
found. Set of Hella 500 series either Clear Driving Lights, Clear Fog Lights
or Amber Fog Lights for $79.95. Price is for a complete kit and I found it
in a catalog from Bimmer Parts Co. Their website
http://www.bimmerpartsco_dot_com
doesn't list these though. You can probably find these somewhere else too.
These lights look to me like something very close to original stuff that was
being installed on Busses and Bugs.

Just my 0.02
