Off the shelf can take more time than making the part. I just bought
some steal flat stock and bent it in the vice. Then drilled a hole at
the top end. To make it look better I cut the corners off of the end
with the hole. I then used standard turnbucles to tighten down the
rack. You need the type with the eye hooks on each end and then bend
them open slightly. One end goes around your rack and the other through
the hole on your home made hook. I put small diameter vinyl hose over
the feet of the rack and the hook to protect the paint. This hose can
be found at big hardware chain stores (I think it is for ice makers).
Make sure and paint any bare steal so it doesn't rust. I have been
using these clamps for at least 2 years now. The rack is on my Crew cab
so it is not full length and I do not push the weight limits. It
regularly carries my scooter and coke cooler to shows.
