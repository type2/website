Subject: 67 tranny and frontbeam into 61?
Message-ID: &lt;Pine.BSF.4.10.9907121110080.40223-100000_at_users.anet-stl_dot_com&gt;

hello all,

i am in the process of buying a 61 sans tranny, and a 67 tranny and front
beam to put in there...(the 61 has a beam, but i want f/r brakes to match)

the thing is, i am not sure what all i need from the 67...

will the shifting mech from teh 61 hook to the 67 nosecone, or is it
different?

are parking brake cables the same, or do i need some of the 67 parts to
get it all to work?

since i am going to 12v, i planned on getting the 67 wiper assembly
will it bolt right in?

i guess thats all my silly questions for now.

thanks,

Steve
