Erin and list:

  I too can't help but think about Josh this time of the year. He was my
best friend, and is the one that sparked my interest in this wonderful
hobby.  You all can imagine the impact he had on the lives here in Ponca by
the way he had an effect on this very list.  He was a great friend who will
always be missed, and never forgotten.
  I wish I could have been on the list when he was to see the lives he
touched via the net.  Thanks to Rob Dahlgren I did get a copy of all the
nice postings you all wrote after he passed away.  I was fortunate enough to
have met a few listees through Josh such as Rick Taylor, Charlie Ford, Rob
Dahlgren, and Ken Hooper. I also met a few members that came down for his
funeral like Dave Pierce, Art Long, and Bill Keating.  It was great to see
that Josh touched so many lives other than here locally.
  Josh and I started our adventures together going to Little Sahara state
park to ride the sand dunes.  We both had quads.  Eventually Josh decided he
needed a buggy because you could drink more beer and still drive one.  He
talked me into getting one myself.  Then he started to talk about getting a
bus.  I asked him,&quot;what do you want one of those damn hippie wagons for?&quot;
He just smiled and laughed.  It wasn't two weeks later he owned one.  We
went out in it one night and he let me drive it.  It was all down hill from
there.
  Josh knew I wanted a bus and he told my girlfriend Lori that he could find
me one when she asked him what she should get me for Christmas.  She thought
it was a great idea and told him to go for it.  Josh drove to memphis to see
Joe Fournier.  A deal was made and he drove back in the &quot;High Karma Westy&quot;.
He then worked his ass off on it for two months every night to make it
presentable for my girlfriend to give to me for Christmas.  Thanks Bud!  I
still own and drive this bus and it will never change owners until the day I
die.
  If anyone regrets not taking Josh up on his offer to ride the dunes in a
VW, let me know and we will go throw some roost!  The double cab Josh and I
rescued I was forced to sell to finance a driver double cab.  I needed a
runner so I could focus on the Westy.  If anyone would like to check out
Josh's website it is still up at http://members.xoom_dot_com/VWRodgers-.  Also
if anyone can make our Josh Rodgers memorial camp-out in Turner Falls just
south of Oklahoma City, you won't be disappointed.  Last year we had a very
nice turn-out, and had a blast!  Will post dates as soon as possible.  It is
held late summer.  Thanks!

&gt; It was 2 years ago this month that our bus loving friend Josh Rodgers
passed
&gt; away.  Although I never met him, I really enjoyed his emails and it pains
me
&gt; to think of what might of been - the shows we might have attended, the
&gt; caravans we might have went on, and the fun we might have had at Little
&gt; Sahara.  I will always remember those pictures of his baywindow with the
&gt; stars 'n'  stripes painted on the sides and that photo that was taken of
him
&gt; next to a junked out double cab found in a junkyard in Oklahoma (which a
&gt; listee now owns I believe.)  I thought it fitting that I should make
mention
&gt; of him in remembrance.  He had a strong personality that eminated even
&gt; through his emails to me.  Maybe a few close friends of Josh would like to
&gt; tell a little story about him and share a few thoughts in remembrance for
&gt; this cool guy.
