Subject: Electrical help needed no start. ground?

OK,
New motor in, ready to go, positive coil side hooked up to 15, checked hot,
cut off clicked on carb. Replaced new Brazilian Condensor with German new.
Replaced coil with known good. I did these two things after trying to start
her with no luck, coil threw a weak spark to engine tin when testing as per
Muir. My question is, can low spark, no spark be caused by bad ground?
Dumbass here forgot to by a trans to chassis gorund strap, and I hooked my
battery ground to body. I will def purchase a ground strap, but am worried
in the mean I am missing something. Could that be the sorce of difficult to
diagnose electric ghosts? And a no start? The engine and trans are basically
completely isolated by new mounts, new engine rubber, etc. I see almost no
way for engine to get ground at this point, perhaps throught front trans
mount, but the rubber is probably too thick.
Frustrated and hoping its something simple as proposed,
Al
