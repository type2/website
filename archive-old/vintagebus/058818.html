Subject: RE: [VB] 67 Double Cab resto

  I have more then 50 hours alone into the just the undercarriage of my DC.
The time included removing everything from the undercarriage, spending
countless hours wire brushing it, then taping off what I didn't want
sprayed, rust morting the under carriage, then painting it. This time does
not include any rust repair (none was needed) or straightening anything. I
now have a completely painted under carriage and figure another 100 plus
hours in rebuilding and painting the front end and trans, doing the brakes,
wiring harness etc. That puts just the undercarriage alone at $7500.00
dollars labor not counting any parts or materials. Thank god my labor is
free (or is it). Then I will add the estimated 300 hours in body work (again
no rust repair or metal replacement) that adds another $15,000 in body and
paint, again not counting materials.
  Then I have upholstery and interior stuff, that should be cheap I figure
$1000.00 dollars for that.
  So all in all I figure I will have at least $25000.00 or so in my DC, it
should be nice though and I would be lucky to sell it for $10,000.00 when
it's done.
  But at least I know I won't have probably 1/3 of what Dave has in his 59!

Ronnie  it'll be done some day

ps. all bassed on an average of 50 dollars an hour
pps; and it's not going to be VN stock

Subject: [VB] 67 Double Cab resto


I have never paid for a full on restoration but a close friend of mine
just got a bid on his 67 Double Cab and I was going to see if any of you
had some input on cost and maybe some other places he should look into.
He has all of the welding completed and the quote is for sandblasting
and then POR 15 the whole double cab and then bodywork and primer. The
bodywork is the smoothing process not welding in major panels as that
has been done already. The quote was for $4700. This would still need a
good paint job on top of that number. It seems a little high to me since
I know this guy is not looking for a show truck just a really nice
driver. Anyone have any recommendations for shops in the Seattle area? I
would bet he would be willing to go as far as Portland OR if there was a
good shop for the right price. He has more money than time, with two
little kids and a more than full time job so you can skip the learn to
do it yourself advice. We have done a couple together and I know he does
not want to go that way this time.
thanks in advance,
