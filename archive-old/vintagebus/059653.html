Subject: A ghostly problem and a reward (long)

I think my bus has a ghost.  If anyone can provide the solution, I offer a
sterling silver bus pendant (which I make)and a chain to wear it on. Even
have your choice of loaf or splitty.

History

I was running a stock 1600 DP, CW crank, balanced, vacuum dizzy, and 34
PICT3. Had always gotten lousy gas mileage, but the bus ran good (55psi oil
pressure, 210 oil temp, and 300/325 CHT _at_ 3800 rpm. One day my vacuum gauge
starts going crazy, flipping from 4 to 20&quot;. Did a compression test and found
#3 down. Checked the vacuum with the brake booster disconnected and gauge
did the same thing. OK says I, I've got a bad valve in #3.

I had a rebuilt 1776 with about 200 miles on it (sitting for 4 years) new
case,new Berg everything,new heads, and 009 with dual Kadrons and the dual
Dell's. The vacuum gauge still goes crazy at idle and this engine runs hot
(250 around the Cincinnati Outerbelt (my test drive).

So, I missed EB, missed CYW, missed Natural Bridge, and I'm going crazy
cause I can't find the answer to the erratic vacuum gauge at idle which I
believe is the underlying cause of my problem. I decide to put in my spare
rebuilt 1600 DP with Kadrons, extractor and 009 Guess what- vacuum gauge
still goes crazy and it is running hot.

On all three engines-vacuum readings were done with brake booster connected
and disconnected. Checked for vacuumed leaks on all 3 engines, have tried
new points, wires,rotor, CD ignition- Vacuumed gauge still goes crazy.

If anyone can solve this ghostly problem I will make them a bus pendant
(with stone headlights the color of your bus).  I really want to go to HCBF
next week so time is of the essence. THANKS for listening (part frustrated
rant and the rest a PLEA for help) TBear

Don't take life to seriously- you'll never live though it...
