Subject: Tips on nose replacement needed

No, I'm not talking about a plastic surgery on my nose but rather about replacing nose skin on my
Bus. For now it looks fair... well, sort of but is full of bondo and the &quot;A&quot; pillar is a little bent
out of shape... door doesn't shut properly and hinges are bent.

So..... all these parts I'm going to get from a donor Bus - whatever I want to replace (need to
replace the nose skin, the &quot;A&quot; pillar and part of the dogleg) and it was suggested to me that
instead of just replacing the nose skin I should go for the entire nose section including dash and
heat tube. What in your opinion is easier to do? What should be done to get the best final result?

For now it's OK but I'm getting a little cold because of the gap between the door and the pillar...

all you opinions will be greatly appreciated.
