Subject: Re: [VB] temp. question

I can see 2800rpm being a sweet spot that makes the engine run cool, but
what i'm talking about is at full highway speed, lets say, 65mph. Don't
worry, I don't drive my bus at 3800rpm in third or second gear. :-)

If you geared your trans to push your bus 65mph at 2800rpm, it will run very
hot, as opposed to if it is geared to run about 3800rpm while doing 65mph.
That's what i'm trying to say.

Do you run head and oil temp gauges, or just oil temp? I run both on mine.
It's nice to have info. I'm actually trying to get ahold of a two sensor
gauge that can be used to measure both head temp, and oil temp through the
dipstick. It is cordless from the sensors to the display (lets just say it's
not for automotive applications). Audible alarms are set to sound when temps
reach your preset levels. You can set the alarms to have the oil alert at
225 degrees, and the heads to alert you at 390. Being cordless, and having
audible alarms, you don't need to worry about having something on your dash
to keep tabs on your temps. You can leave it in your parcel tray if you
like.  I'll let you guys know how it works. If it does work well, i'll be
sure to let you all know.
