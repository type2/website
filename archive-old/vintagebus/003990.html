Well, I'm not going any higher than my bid right now since I found these to
be a very good repros. Others are more expensive...... no doubt they might
be better.......... I'll see......and as soon as I have some more time on my
hands I'll do some more research.

As buying on eBarf???? I do check prices before I buy......... it's selling
that makes me loose money once in a while.

Thanks,

&gt; Are you talking about the ones on ebay?  From the pix, they look
&gt; like they're either BusBoys or Wolfgang Safaris - I've not heard
&gt; of them making their *own* safaris.    It looks to me like they're
&gt; making themselves into a clearing house for various repro bits;
&gt; the deluxe trim they're selling looks like the stuff from CE, etc.
&gt;
&gt; As to the quality of the windows, I feel you're better served to
&gt; spend a little more and buy Izzy's or CE.
&gt;
&gt; Besides - why buy retail items on ebay, unless you know for *certain*
&gt; that you're gonna pay less than retail?  I keep seeing over-the-counter
&gt; items going for more than retail because people just don't get this
&gt; simple fact thru their heads.
