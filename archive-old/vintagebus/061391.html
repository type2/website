Subject: Re: [VB] Repair shop / engine builder in PA to avoid ....WARNING.....   LONG

&gt; 
&gt; Thanks for lending an ear and eye, and good advice.
&gt; I will post info
&gt; when we spec this engine out, and attempt to save
&gt; her, 


Wow, sounds like quite the nightmare!  Sorry to hear
about all you had to go through.  I had a similar
experience here in Idaho about 7 years ago and guess
what.... the guy is out of business now.  He screwed
enough people that it eventually caught up with him. 
I guess that however you do business it always comes
back to you, good or bad. :)
