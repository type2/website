&gt; I hope to make my maiden voyage to the gas station this week. I've
&gt; gotta do some work on the electrical first. Looks like I'm gonna have
&gt; to replace a brake cylinder at one of the back wheels. It's leaking
&gt; all over my fresh white wheel. It's a big nut. Does Ronnie carry
&gt; those? How much are those?
&gt;
&gt; Getting excited!!!

Does anyone else see a connection between Rex's posts and NQ's?  Its great to see
people getting excited about working on T2s again.  Way to go Rex.  Keep it up!
You and NQ keep me motivated.  Believe me, I need all the motivation I can get.
