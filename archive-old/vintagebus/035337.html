&lt;&lt; They make a head stud that has an over-sized, self-tapping thread on the 
'case' end, for just your problem. You double nut the 'head' end, and screw 
the other end into the case.  When you get it threaded into the case to the 
proper point, the double nuts are removed and a single nut is tightened to 
the proper torque. &gt;&gt;
Hi Volks,
Thes work great, but you have to do a few more thing to get longevity from 
your repair.  First measure or take in the old head stud for proper length.  
While taking out the old stud see if there was an oversized stud had been 
used before or even a case saver.  If so you are going to have to install a 
case saver or a next size up case saver to fix the problem.  Above all when 
tapping in the new threads into the case take back out the tap or especially 
the oversized head stud every turn to clean out the shavings to prevent 
galling the new threads your are trying to create.
If your repair pulls out soon after it is a darn good sign of an engine case 
that has been heated up too much and has softened the alloy.    Eric&amp;Barb
