Hi Dbolen,
The big problem with that is the engine is vibrating a lot more then the  
body firewall.  So if you have one end of the metal fuel line and the other  
through the body firewall the fuel line has to constantly flex more.   Resulting 
in work hardening, and failure due to cracking.  Just as a coat  hanger can be 
used umpteen times, and snap it goes that last time.
