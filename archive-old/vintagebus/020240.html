All of this talk of quickly getting to a given
destination makes me feel out of place. I am known for
keeping up with or leading the pack but getting there
in my own time. Tend to cool the engine and walk the
dog at length... Side trips and a bout with F'ed up
shift couplers have added to the reputation. Now that
the baby is on board we can just say,
&quot;fahgeddabowdit!&quot;

Phoenix to LA- 12.5 hrs
Phoenix to SanJose- 24 hrs
Phoenix to Jerome AZ- 5hrs

Total time getting to the Pre-Classic Crowne Plaza
Hotel in Irvine, California (formerly Irvine Holiday
Inn) from Central Phoenix in the old Barnambulator was
12.5 hours! Many rest stops, extreme head winds, 36hp
engine, fully packed like the Clampett's heading to
Beverly Hills and a four wheel drive adventure in
search of Rich Yost's place added to the time. 

In 1996 Paula and I spent 24 hours getting to the
Kelly Park event from Central Phoenix. We were driving
the high speed big deal dual carbed overly-touted
1776cc Westy Resto from Hell. (prior to owning the
trailer!) We pulled into a rest stop at the top of the
Grapevine prior to heading onto the long straight
Northbound I-5 Central Valley. I swore that I was not
tired. Paula made me rest. In spite of all of my
protesting and all of the Semitrucks and endless
comings and goings we woke up a full 12.5 hours later!
Sometimes sleep is like uncut drugs! I think that was
the LAST 12.5 hours of sleep that I've had.

Phoenix to Jerome is usually 1.5hrs if you drag an
anchor and drive on all flat tires. One year, we drove
Beto's '63 EZ camper prior to discovering that all of
the rings had lined up on all cylinders. &lt;no
compression&gt;. Plus we blew a shift coupler 1 mile from
the event and got dragged in by some kindly drunks
like a Mardi Gras float behind some miscellaneous Ford
Truck.

How slow can you go?
