&gt; baywindow tank from a 70 bus.  I have some questions that need to be

&gt; #1abc)  Will the 12v sender from this tank work with my 6v bus guage?  Will
&gt; I need a new guage?  Can a 12v to 6v resistor drop be used in anyway to help
&gt; with this conflict?

12v sender works fine.  it is just a variable resistor, allowing a
percentage of the voltage to get through..works fine.
 
&gt; #2)  Will a 6v sending unit from a split window bus tank fit in a baywindow
&gt; tank with no mods?

possbily, but you would run out of gauge before you ran out of gas.;)  and
there is no difference between a 6v sender and 12v.;p


&gt; #3)  Will the stock gas cap from a splitty tank go onto a baywindow tank?

only if you go the route some have went and cut the filler neck off of a
splitty tanek and use it.  (baywindows do not have the integral
fillerneck..)

if you can get the 70 neck and hose, then follow my instructions i posted
earlier on installing it,. the 70 tank should be idntical to the 69..

good luck.
