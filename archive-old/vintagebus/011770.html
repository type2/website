Subject: I crashed my bus
Date: Mon, 14 Sep 1998 12:34:24 PDT

Well, looks like I won't be putting in that new stub axle or fixing that 
horn wire, after all :-(  
Saturday evening I was on my way to dinner, after picking up a new stub 
axle, when I crossed through an uncontrolled intersection and got hit 
just behind the driver's door.  The cops say they expect my bus will be 
written off.  Damn.  I don't remember a thing until waking up in 
hospital Sunday morning.  Feels like I bashed my head into the window 
and my knee into the steering column.
Now all I can do is wait for ICBC (insurance corporation of B.C.)  to 
decide whose fault it was.  I think I had the right of way, but ICBCs 
rules do not reflect the law in many cases, as they like to decide 
accidents are 50-50 each person's fault so they don't have to pay out 
too much money.  Anyway they'll probably decide my bus was worth about 
$100 either way.  Sorry if this message doesn't make much sense: bashing 
my head into the window has made me kind of confused.
