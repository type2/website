While reading my M-code plate in order to add my bus to Thom's registry, I
discovered the option code &quot;002&quot;,
anyone know what this is?
Also, there's a rectangular adhesive sticker just below the M-code plate
which reads &quot;Samtgrun L512&quot; (with the two little dots above the &quot;u&quot;
I assume this sticker has to do with the color (38 38 83) on the M-code
Does anyone have an idea on the 002 or the sticker?
