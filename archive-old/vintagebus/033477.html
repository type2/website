I have one that bolts to the to the frame members where the bumper mounts 
and to the first cross-member fore of the tranny.
'course the mounting points on the cross-... are welded on, but I'm sure it 
wouldn't be hard to devise a different attachment method.
I would personally trust this setup to tow anything the truck could move. 
not much with a 40hp though:)
I can take some pics and send them to you if you want.

&gt;  Am looking for plans for a splitty hitch that is not bumper mounted or if
&gt;  you have a hitch laying around that would work too.  What are the list
&gt;  consensus (If there is such a thing) on mounting points for a hitch and if
&gt;  you have one that works good for you can you send the pics
&gt;  Thanks
