Subject: Translation needed for VW tool...

Hi again,

At the recent C.O.V.V.C. show in Columbus, OH I scored a rare VW Special 
Service tool from an older VW factory trained mechanic in the swap 
meet.  Made by MATRA, this is the tool made to quickly and precisely 
adjust/set proper toe-in on the front suspension of any early VW model.  
Very neat item, I can't wait to throw out my old yard sticks (ala the 
Muir method for setting toe-in) and put this SST to use.  There is a 
small calibration scale on the tool and the words on it are in German.  
Can anyone translate the words &quot;VORSPUR&quot; and &quot;NACHSPUR&quot; for me?  I'm 
guessing it's something like positive and negative, or more and less, 
you get the idea.  Thanks for the translation assistance!
