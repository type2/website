&gt;&gt;   Is just me or is
&gt;  &gt; it just sad to see all those Buses just wasting away out in the yard.


sadly, austin veedub has been known to crush a few jewels now and 
again! when i bought my s/c from them, it got lucky - a few months 
later they crushed ALL BUSSES except deluxes.
i go out there now and again and see what has come in recently and 
try and save stuff, but one can only do so much :P
last time they had just gotten a new american camper highroof with a 
PRISTINE gray interior... sink, bed, closets etc.

they left all the doors open on it.  water had already begun to ruin 
the laminated woodwork.
