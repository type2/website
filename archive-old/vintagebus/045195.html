&lt;&lt;can I use a paper filter in the oilbath aircleaner housing? Has anyone done 
this? I've read that in dusty climates you have to clean the oil bath filter 
every 1000 miles or so and I dont want to fool with it - is that so?&gt;&gt;
Just use the oil bath air cleaner.  The stock oil bath is self cleaning to a 
point, and for normal conditions only needs the oil poured out every 3,000 
miles.  Occasionally needs a wipe to get the settled crud out of the bottom.  
You would have to drive in very sandy/dusty conditions alot to need to change 
the oil every 1,000 miles.  To put a aftermarket paper air filter in the same 
area would be akin to trying to run in a marathon with all but one nostril 
taped shut.  Take a look at the later water cooled air filters.  Much bigger, 
and the paper element has tons more surface area to keep the breathabilty up 
even when used in dusty conditions.  If you plan on crossing the Sahara or 
some such dusty/sandy area look into finding the larger accessory oil bath 
air filter.  It looks alot like the VW Thing (Which was designed for off road 
usage!) air filter.

&lt;&gt;
Definitely check out the type2 library for the article we wrote on installing 
a 1972 and later dual MC.  Cost is about $50.00 total, and in the end if you 
blow a wheel cylinder, flex line or metal brake line you should still have 
half your brakes to stop with instead of no brakes you would have with a 
single circuit.  Plus this dual MC is availible just about everywhere.
