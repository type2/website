Subject: RE: [VB] Re: [T2] AridZona Full Length Bus Rack

I've considered this as well, on my 8 foot rack of conner manufacture.
Has anyone experimented with the wood, plus holes to drain water and
air? Kind of defeats purpose, but still adds some armor up there.

  The problem I have found with putting plywood on the roof rack is it
really affects the handling of the bus at 70 plus MPH, also I noticed
that in cross winds it is like a sail moving me all around. I did this
when I drove to NM and have since removed the plywood. Going to Jerome
with it loaded and slower made no difference in the way it handled.

  Did make a great photo platform though!
