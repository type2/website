I remember a guy named Lenny from the West Coast, it seemed as though he came
highly recommended...anyone know the guys number or how to get intouch with
him?

Also I was planning on redoing the pads, should i go with the original type
hair pad, or go with the new foam pad...what are your experiences with these
two different products. Or just any reccomendations on seat pads? What to do,
how hard is it to do myself?

thanks
