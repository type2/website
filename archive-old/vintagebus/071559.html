Subject: Re: [VB] Front Trans Mount Q

I bought a new one from Wolfsburg West over last Christmas, and it's not had
any trouble.  As for replacing it without pulling the transmission, I can't
help you there.  My transmission was already out when I replaced the front
tranny mount.  Good luck.

&gt; 1) is there a source for *good* front mounts?  I replaced
&gt; mine recently - about a month ago - and the new one already
&gt; broke!
&gt;
&gt; 2) anyone ever replace the mount without removing the transmission?
