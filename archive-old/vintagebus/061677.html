Subject: Re: [VB] pre-67 westy hammocks

The poles will be round with crimped and bent ends.  One pole will be
shorter than the other by a few inches.  I don't have mine handy to
measure just now.  The fabric will be a dark green heavy canvas with
dark stitching.  Not much more too it than that.

&gt; Hi everyone,
&gt; Is there a way to tell original material for the pre-67 hammocks.
&gt; What is the length of the rails also?
&gt; 
&gt; I just picked up one today that is supposedly original material and it's in near perfect unused condition. Told it came out of a 66 westy. But just want some list clarification.
&gt; The seller wanted $75, but took $50. I haven't seen an early cot in this shape before, much less the scarcity of early ones anyways.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks in advance,
