&gt; &quot;La Migra&quot; is the INS, those guys in the light green

Ellis sez:
It was all understood and written in an attempt of
what some folks call ~tongue in cheek~ humor. &lt;as in
Joke/attempted sly humor&gt;. It only appears that I'm
racist, anti-Semite and non-observant of over used
cliche' graphics affixed to and used to cheapen the
appearance of over priced vehicles. I am not
anti-Semitic by any means. 
Living in Arizona I am keenly aware of what &quot;La Migra&quot;
is. They are the folks who blocked my residential
street for two hours with two 40 foot tourist-like
buses with a police car in front and in back of the
buses. The street was blocked while 120 &quot;immigrant&quot;
law breakers used up my tax dollars while being
removed from one small residential home and prevented
me from driving my VW bus to my destination. I thank
them for dragging down my property value. This
incident has been repeated 360,000 times in Arizona so
far this year alone.
BTW: I did wave at them as I was finally able to drive
by. I got curious and similar waves back at me.
