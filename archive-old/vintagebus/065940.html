Subject: RE: [VB] Angle of Dangle

I had to do the same thing with my SC. Fortunately, all the PO did was lower
the rear be adjusting the spring plates on the torsion bars. I just followed
the Bently and readjusted them back to 20 degrees. I built a spring plate
compression tool just like the one shown in the pictures and a simple degree
plate. If anyone is interested in buying them, I made two sets and can part
with one for $25. It was a big help to me. If it's beyond anyone's meager
salary to own one, get with your local club and see if they want to buy it
for their members.

sitting or standing?

20 degrees with bus level. when I undid the lowering on my 15 window this
was slightly below the lower stop. set it at 20 degrees then used a floor
jack to lift the spring plate enough to get it on the plate and taped it the
rest of the way on.


&gt; One of the tasks ahead of me with my new double cab is
&gt; to un-lower it (lowering bits are spoken for).  This will
&gt; mean installing stock spring plates again.  What I need
&gt; is the angle of the spring plates, unladen by the reduction
&gt; boxes.  Anyone?
