&gt;&gt; I just bought a 6V Radio Becker that was in a deluxe split in France,
&gt;&gt; and i want to know if i just have to add a resistor on my 12 V system
&gt;&gt; to work !!

When using a 6V device in a 12V Bus, you do have to drop the supply voltage
to the radio to 6V or the device will get fried.  This is commonly done
with either a resistor, or a voltage regulator.

The resistor is best for loads that are essentially fixed - that draw
the same current under nearly all operating conditions.  The windshield
wiper motor is a good example of this kind of load.

The voltage regulator is better for loads that can draw varying amounts
of current under different operating conditions.  A radio is an example
of such a load - at a low volume it will draw less current, but at a
higher volume it will draw higher current.  If a fixed resistor is
used to drop the 12V to &quot;6V&quot;, the &quot;6V&quot; seen by the radio will actually
vary in value depending on the current being drawn by the radio.

For an example, consider a 6V radio that draws 1 amp at maximum volume.
At this point the radio is mostly equivalent to a 6 ohm resistance.
To run it on 12V, you'd put a 6 ohm resistor, rated at least 6 watts
(preferably 10 or more) in series with the power wire to the radio.
As long as you always play the radio at full volume, everything will
be fine.  However, let's assume that when you play the radio at half
volume, it draws half the current - 0.5 amp.  Now the radio is mostly
equivalent to a 12 ohm resistance.  The 12 ohm effective resistance
of the radio in series with the 6 ohm resistor gives 18 ohms total,
which will draw 0.67 A from 12 V.  The 6 ohm resistor will drop only
4 V, leaving the radio with 8 V - a 33% increase over its nominal
rating!

The most common kind of voltage regulator is basically a self-adjusting
resistor.  It continuously adjusts itself to supply the correct voltage
for the current its load is drawing at the moment, within reasonable
limits.  Mostly these come in two flavors: fixed and adjustable.  The
fixed ones have a set output voltage, and the adjustable ones allow
you to adjust the output voltage by using a small variable resistor.
You can &quot;trick&quot; the fixed ones into giving a higher, but still fixed,
output, by playing with what the device thinks &quot;ground&quot; is.

Some (electronic) part numbers of note are...

7805        fixed +5V 1A regulator
7806        fixed +6V 1A regulator
LT1085-5CT  fixed +5V 3A regulator
LT1084-5CK  fixed +5V 5A regulator
LT1083-5CK  fixed +5V 7A regulator

LM317T      adjustable 2-36V 1.5A regulator
LM350K      adjustable 2-30V 3A regulator
LT1084CP    adjustable 2-30V 5A regulator
LT1083CP    adjustable 2-30V 7A regulator

The reason why I list the 5V regulators is that they are *MUCH* more
common than 6V regulators.  (Lots of digital logic, including the
guts of the computer you're reading this on, runs at +5V).  You can
fake them up to +6V by putting their &quot;ground&quot; terminal one volt
above actual ground...a diode or two is the usual way.

If you want to go the other way - running a 12V device in a 6V Bus -
it gets more complicated.  The usual thing to do is to use an
&quot;inverter&quot; or &quot;DC-DC converter&quot;.  This is a magic box that takes
6V in and gives you 12V out.  Basically what it is doing is chopping
up the 6V DC input into about 6V AC, running it through a transformer
to turn it into about 12V AC, and then rectifying it to get 12V DC.
It's usually simpler to buy this ready-made.

As far as actually acquiring any of this stuff goes, you have to
realize that in electronic parts, Radio Shack is to a real electronics
supplier as the &quot;automotive&quot; shelf of your local grocery store is to
the Rocky Mountain Motorworks catalog for VW parts.  You can actually
get a 7805, an LM317, and the diodes and resistors you will need to
make it work at Radio Shack.  To get the fancier stuff, you can order
it from Radio Shack if you like spending money, or you can order it
yourself from a supplier like Mouser or Digi-Key.

You *used* to be able to get the 6V-12V inverters at Radio Shack, too,
but they don't sell them anymore - best chance for these is either the
swap meet (used) or maybe JC Whipme.

This is a simple introduction but hopefully will make some stuff
clearer.  Good luck!
