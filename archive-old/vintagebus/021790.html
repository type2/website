&lt;&lt; Is there really any point to trying to convince someone to drive their Bus
 year round?  Part of having a Bus is not having society's values crammed
 down your throat.  Unless I'm mistaken, owing a Bus is not even a 
pre-requisite
 to joining a VW club &gt;&gt;

Your just mad cause you know you dont drive your bus all the time.
