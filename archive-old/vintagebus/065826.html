&gt; Is a 1776cc just a 1600cc with larger pistons?  does anyone know what
&gt; size?  what stock parts are affected by the different engine?

Hi Tim,
Depends!  Cc can be increased by either or a combination of stroke or bore 
enlargement.  Increasing the crank stroke increases torque which is very good 
for a bus especially for hill climbing, increasing bore of the P&amp;Cs increases 
HP which is not as good for a bus.  Also increasing the bore of the P&amp;Cs 
above 87mm really requires boring the openings in the heads and engine case 
open.  Doing this really weakens the engine case just forward the # 3 
cylinder and often it cracks there to pour oil on the FW and clutch.

&gt; I need to get my locks rekeyed so that they all work, and with just one key, 
&gt; who should I see for that?

Either find an old fashioned locksmith who can cut you new keys just off your 
ignition key code.  He might also have the pins to change in the door handle 
tumblers.  Or try Gabrile _at_ GABVWKEY_at_cs_dot_com  or  (209) 475-0868.


&gt; I should be traveling to Taos for thanksgiving, is there anywhere between 
&gt; Stillwater, OK and there that I should visit?

Make sure to take a copy of the AIRS list!
