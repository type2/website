In a message dated 98-10-29 14:47:43 EST, was write:

&lt;&lt; Is there someplace I can find the westy code when almost all traces of the
 westiness are gone? this applies to my 64 as well as 68 both were originally
 non pop westies but alas now just kombis. &gt;&gt;

Well in the early 60s the camper # was stamped on the rear chassi plate to the
right of the engine.  The other problem is that not all buses that have been
found with westie interiors were westies.  In other words they did not make
the pilgrimage to the Westphalia factory to be converted.  We found a example
- ---  
and the westy kit style also shows up on the M code plate- such as B42 or some
such.  Except not on my 65 westy, which really is a SO 42 westy, but no stamp
on mcode tag.   And no electrical socket, but has tent mount points, is a type
23 with two tone paint from factory.     But many people have reported a westy
code on the tag.   Also on the tag on the fresh air duct overhead, for those
who have the tag on the fresh air duct.
