Actually I had one of those refracters in a '51 Pontiac Cheiftain that I
used to own because it came from the factory with a sun visor.  I havent
seen one since.  Now I will have the whole list looking for old Ponchos in
junkyards for refractors for their buses.  :-)

Hi Volks,
This brings to mind a broken devise we saw years ago that was a franell
(SP?)
lense (like a lighthouse has.) to refract the image of stop lights to the
eyes of drivers of chopped topped american lead sled!  It suctioned cupped
to
the dash.  Maybe someone on the list knows about this item or knows someone
who would and where to buy them.  Eric&amp;Barb
