&gt; Part     Description 
&gt; 211 129 612 (larger oil capacity) for M156, 42-44 HP

That one was bolted to the inner right rear wheel well and can be seen in the 
1963-67 Workshop Manual in section K-2, pages 11b - 12.

&gt; 141 129 613  42-44 HP
&gt; 
&gt; I do know someone who has a 211 129 613 without the B.
&gt; What would that be? 
&gt; 
&gt; And what's the diff. between the 211 and the 141 prefix?

211 129 613 B would be for Bastard 40 HP and very early plain 40 HP.  So 
without a &quot;B&quot; would probably be an earlier model like 36 HP.  
  211 is bus and 141 is K. Ghia!
