It is still Friday to me...
Delete now if you dont want useless ramblings...

So my 63 was happy, last month. We had nice weather here in the PNW, and
things were drying out. My bus leaks like crazy. Then the weather turned
hard and cold. Like ice and rain, my bus was cold agian.
The door handle on the drivers side (outside) broke, right off in my hands.
The engine sounds not so good, and the tranny is beginning to sound wrong.
Not sure, but wrong.
I have fixed the handle, look out you 63 or so people, the weakest link in
the door handle is actually the small metal collar for lack of a better
description. And be sure and examine closely your handle versus others for
replacement. The easrlier years and yours are not the same.

On another note, I helped a friend take out his broken 72 engine. What a
pain in our butts! This engine had sucked a valve, (I won a bet), and had
blown its way through the piston, and then had found its way into the engine
and popped out two holes trough the case before it finally became stuck in
the top half of the case. Took all day to get that engine out, mostly
because of the tranny which also went south, having the spline become
unconnected and pulled out with the motor, which we of course didnt know
till it was all over.
I am writing most of this crap to simply say this: Why the heck did VW
decide to close off the back of the engine compartment? WHY!!!! The two to
four bolts we sensible people take out to remove the deck lid, make so much
sense. Never, ever, not even on a bet, will I own some silly VW that cant
let me just take out 4 bolts and remove my engine!
Enough said.
I dont usually rant, but here it is anyway!
Jason
