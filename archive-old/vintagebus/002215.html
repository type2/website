Subject: looking for torsion arm rubber snub

Hi All,

I'm looking for an (or two) original (in good shape of course) front torsion
arm rubber snub.

I have one with a part number of 111-401-223 (or was it a 211-401-223?)

The parts book I have is unclear as to the actual part number for my 59
double cab (469869).

Can anyone get me these rubber snubs???

Also, I'm looking for a few correct tie rod rubber boots.


Thanks and always willing to pay!

David
