Subject: Re: [VB] Need a '65 wiper shaft

&gt; This is a true need--I've come out from lurking to ask if anyone has one
&gt; (OK two if there is that many, though only one is broken at this
&gt; point...) wiper shaft for my '65 bus?  It appears that only a '65 fits a
&gt; '65, and have not found it from Wolfburg West or West Coast Metric.  I
&gt; would truly appreciate the help!

This may not work for you, depending how similar the mechanism is to
a '67, but I improvised a solution for my '67 that's been working for
two years.  (Had to drive it home 400 miles in heavy rain and both
wiper shafts were frozen with rust and broken).

I discovered the threaded &quot;nipple&quot; pipe used with standard lamp fixtures
-- as in, table lamps with light bulbs etc -- is only a bit bigger than
the original tubes around the wiper shafts.  I found some steel rod that
was a close match for the shaft, and made bushings out of plastic tubing
since it was quite a bit smaller than the inside diameter of the pipes.
(Wrapping it with tape would also work.) Add nuts and washers to keep
the tubes in place in the body and on the wiper mechanism frame.  The
shafts are bent into an &quot;L&quot; shape and attached to the existing arms on
the wiper mechanism -- crudely at first but I later brazed them.  Once
you figure out where the wiper arm should attach to make the right arc,
file a flat spot on the shaft so its anchoring screw holds it there.

I even made covers for the ends of the tubes, to keep the rain out, out of
plastic soda bottle caps.  They're ugly but so is the rest of my bus.

All this was before I knew that there even _were_ replacements being made,
but this kludge has worked reliably for two years so I see no need to replace it!

good luck,

    -- Larry
