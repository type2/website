Subject: RE: [VB] Wobbly belt?

Did the pulley checks, even blamed my new motor for excessive endplay,
but no wiggles at either end. The wobble is only on the side of the belt
closest to carb, and is about 1/4&quot; in movement. Even disappears above
1700rpm, but slight and noticible at idle. Pulleys are lined up and
tight. Perhaps gen bearing had become eccentric somehow? No noises
besides a Volkswagen engine.
I am adjusting valves one more time since we now have 150 miles (just
did oil change 3)...Storage immenent for PA winter...
Found little particles of nasties in my oil, some more assembly lube at
drain pan bottom, think she's at all oil now! W0000!

 Would generator bearings be a good bet if my belt wobbles (vibrates
slightly in and out in the same axis of the pulleys), even though it is
tightened to 1/2 deflection. Vibration diminished at engine expansion
warmup, and is negligble at 1250+ rpm...I turned pulley like crazy when
tightening, she's not crooked. I learned that lesson, along with using
ALL the  &gt;&gt;

take the fan belt off.  grab the gen pulley nut- can you wiggle it? up
and
down or side to side.  Reach around the front of the fan housing and
grab
that big 36mm nut holding the fan to the generator and try to wiggle it.

It is not supposed to wiggle, if it does the bearing at the wiggly end
of the
generator is bad.   Usually there is a sort of whine associated with bad

bearings, and if the rear bearing is bad you can see the pulley wobble.
If
you start the engine up w/o belt and the whine is gone, well, that is
where
it was from.  Don't freak, it is okay to run the motor briefly w/o the
belt,
but don't leave it running or drive like that because of lack of
cooling.  If
you have bad bearings it will wear brushes and belts out, and get worse
until
i dunno it explodes or something, so it would need replacement.
