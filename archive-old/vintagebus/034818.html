&lt;&lt; ou actually ave to remove the fanshroud and the two vent tins to find the 
Hoover  L deflector.  It mounts to the cooler with the two nuts that hold the 
cooler to the adaptor, and has a L that Ls around to the right (windward) 
side of the cooler.   THere is a place for a screw to screw the front of the 
doghouse bit of the shroud to the L bit.  Have only ever found that screw 
done once.    &gt;&gt;
