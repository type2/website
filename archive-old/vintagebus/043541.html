&gt;they changed the configuration of the M code plate between 62 and 65-
&gt;I think for 63 or 64?  [...] the later style has day-mo date on top
&gt;line, and the colour is in code, you get a sticker underneath with
&gt;german writing the name of the colour(s) and the L code

The M-code plate on my '64 is the later style you described:
15 N
426 025 114
UF 2813 421781 1203065

This is a '64 built on 15 Nov. '63.  It also has the sticker under
the plate with the paint codes.

On Thom's &quot;confirm your Registry submission&quot; page, it shows you
what your plate should look like based on the data you input.  Maybe 
he knows the cut-over date?
