&gt; Dr. Joe Nodzak--Has left us--

Oh no.  Well I think it was him that I talked to on the phone a year and
half ago.  Had a deep voice as I recall - kind of gruff.

Well shoot, that pretty much takes care of the bus towbar business.  Is
there someone to step up to the plate and make them?  I wouldn't mind
getting ahold of the jigs and making them myself.

BTW: Jerry - when did Dr. Joe pass away?  He sounded pretty good on the
phone when I talked to him last...
