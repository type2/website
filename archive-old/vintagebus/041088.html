Thom,
Do you ever sleep? (grin) I log on first thing in the morn, and there you
are...bright and early, throwing awesome advice here, and slinging cool tips
there. Before I hit the hay, once again, I see you commenting. Very
impressive, 'ol boy. Thanks for the tips.
Jon

&gt; &gt;     but having driven type 1, dual-carbed, stroker engines for well over
80k
&gt; &gt; miles, i know for a fact that it can be done, with great results... and
no
&gt; &gt; need for chokes or vacuum advance distributors  :-)
&gt;
&gt; Wow - 80,000 miles - that's a lot!  Well, maybe not...
&gt;
&gt; .._dot_compared to the collective *billions* of trouble-free miles driven by
folx
&gt; with off the shelf, original, easily obtainable, stock parts, available
from
&gt; a number of sources, and not one little shop in SoCal; you don't have to
&gt; take out a 2nd mortgage to buy them; by people who like to do stuff
&gt; *other* than futz with their engine constantly; who haven't been farting
&gt; around with engines their entire natural life; and there's no magic vodoo
&gt; or endless experimentation to get the magic combo.
&gt;
&gt; But stock isn't sexy, and doesn't make for good &quot;tech&quot; articles on how
&gt; to make your VW more &quot;sano&quot;.
&gt;
&gt; You Berg disciples should be more low key - if more people were to try to
buy
&gt; their stuff, either the prices will go up even more, or quality will go
down
&gt; due to trying to increase production.  They will become a victim of their
own
&gt; sucess.
&gt;
&gt; I have no interest in making my VW go fast.  I'm just happy if it gets me
from
&gt; A to B in one piece.   There are other cars for going fast, which do this
very
&gt; well out of their own box, and generally for less money than it would take
to
&gt; *properly* get a VW up to the same level.   As an example, I hear the
GoFast
&gt; guys prattle on all day long about how &quot;stroked&quot; they are, and their
webber
&gt; 42 DNF (did not finish) carbs, yet I never hear brakes mentioned.
