&lt;&lt; but do 
 GRBs have seals?  I'm just getting to know my bus thats only 6 or 7 weeks 
 old to me and haven't tore into one.  The passenger side wheel has always 
 had stuff spewed all over it.  Wasn't sure if it was brake fluid from a 
 falty wheel cylinder or a gear oil leak...pretty sure its the later.  I 
 tightened the bolts on him the last time I fed the tranny Staylube but he 
 still leaks...I'm not even sure if its leaking form the split in the GRB 
 case.  Any ideas.
  &gt;&gt;
Rdeuction Gear Boxes (RGBoxes) do have seal, and can leak.

first, is the leaking stuff thin or thick.  DOes it smell like gear oil?  If 
not, you have leaky brakes.  If so, where is it leaking from- 

betwwen spring plate and RGB?  (rgbox plug leaking)
inside the drum?  (axle seal)
between the RGBox halves (unlikely)?

sometimes it will drip out the axle seal return drainhole, which comes out on 
the inside of the brake backing plate.

you can clean it off, drive around, and see later.   Usually it leaks from 
the rear axle seal, which means drum and brakes must come off, read about it 
in your John Muir Idiot Book and/or the Bentley book

so I would go buy some axle seal kits, set of rear brakes shoes, heck if you 
haven't got new rear brake hoses in the past 5 years do them too (safety 
first)  as they are more accessible with the wheel off and you'll have to 
bleed the brakes anyway, and fix that puppy.
