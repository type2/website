Subject: Re: [VB] Looking for Clamps for rack

&gt;I am looking for some clamps for my rack. It is hard to describe racks by
&gt;words, but here goes. It is a genuine VW rack, can tell by the sticker on it.
&gt;It is the taller of the metal racks and has no provisions on the rack itself
&gt;for clamps. It is made of thinner material that the &quot;conduit appearance&quot; of
&gt;the industrial racks. Bars run only from side to side of bus, no front to
&gt;rear bars. The clamps look like three pieces, a hook for the drip rail, a
&gt;&quot;two hook claw&quot; for the rack, and a threaded piece that joins the two
&gt;together and is tightened by a placing a screwdriver or something similair
&gt;and turning. Need these please, if you have any questions about what kind of
&gt;rack I have and you might have clamps, please P-mail me. I will try to find a
&gt;picture of what I am describing.
&gt;                    Mike


I need a couple of clamps and screws for my Westy roof rack.  Will PAY for
them!  :-)
