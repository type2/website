&gt; Has anyone ever tried mounting an antenna on the undercarriage of a bus?

Robert,
I just remembered about some hidden antennas that I had seen.  Generally, they are a short piece of wire that you stick &quot;somewhere&quot; out of sight and it is connected to an active amplifier that is tuned for the broadcast bands.  I vaguely remember seeing something in a hot rod mag for those
wanting tunes without sticking a hole in their vintage ride.  The very same thing is keeping me from poking a hole in my DC for an antenna until I get that sorted out.  Unfortunately, its about number 98 on a list of 99 things to do.
