I went over to a fellow duners house today to buy some gaskets from him.
While we were digging for them I noticed a torsion housing with a split case
tranny and motor on it. Upon closer inspection I saw the molded in generator
stand. I don't have any numbers but can get them if any one is interested. I
had heard that a 36er looked like this; I don't know any thing about these
boat anchors, I'm still too young for anything smaller than a 1600! He said
he would sell, I think pretty cheap! It is complete from exhaust to air
cleaner. Later on!
