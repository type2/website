&lt;&lt; I am currently looking for the piece that the engine lid bottom locks into 
(bolts into the outsider corner rear fenders) (I believe it is called the 
rear valance).&gt;&gt;
Hi Mike,
That is commonly called a rear apron.

&lt;&lt;Also I am looking for the handle assembly for the engine lid.  If anyone 
has or could point me in the right direction it would be greatly appreciated! 
&gt;&gt;
For the buses up to about 1966 the engine lid opened with a church key.  No 
handle back there just a chrome cover over the hole.   Eric&amp;Barb
