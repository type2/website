Hi,

I visited the SOTO meet for a short time. Brought the wife this time.
She liked the restored buses and thought the rust buckets were just a
piece of c%_at_p. The resto's gave her some good decorating ideas for my
bus. I didn't count but there were somewhere between 40 and 60 buses
there. And best of all I found a steering wheel for $2.

Chris
