Subject: Re:  [VB] Barndoor speedo p/n?
To: paulcwilliamson_at_yahoo_dot_com, vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com


Ok all...as the subject says, I'm looking for the part
number for a Barndoor speedometer.  I think I have
one, the part number is:

241 957 023

The strange thing is, it's stamped &quot;2/59&quot; on the case.
 There's also another letter/number combo (W .77), but
as previously discussed, I think that's the
calibration value or something like that.
- - -- - - - 
the part number is for a barndoor.    in my 63ed  list is lists that 
211 957 021 -speedo (km) up to 20-117 901
211 957 021D speedo (km) 20-117 902 up to 1 219 510
211 957 021F speedo (km) from 20-117902 to 1 219 510 M215, also  from 1219511
241 957 023   is speedo (miles) up to ch no. 20-117 901   M20

etc etc

there were more than one version of the barndoor speedo, and I think yours 
would be the 36hp (54/55) version.    for several reasons, the main being  
the part number you listed is the 54 on version.    the earlier version the 
needle swings the other way.

fwiw, in canada in 1957 that  number  speedo  would cost $17.90

yes the dated stamped should be the production date.  meaning that you have a 
speedo made after they stopped making barndoors- made as a replacement parts. 

re parts lists.  you do not need a &quot;barndoor parts list&quot; to look up barndoor 
parts.   each parts list lists part available at that time.   meaning some 
earlier versions were superceded,  but the 67 or 70 edition I am sure would 
have that part listed.  If you have a parts list, or look at the website 
where it is scanned, you will see what I mean.
