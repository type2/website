For those who has the Hoover CD, there is an essay on an absolutely ingenious
way to protect your bus that can only be easily be installed on a bus due to
its clutch and brake petal geometry, at least I THINK it's on the CD.  The
other two ways (mentioned below after this post) are pretty good, but I
guarantee that for someone trying to rip off your bus with this gadget
installed (only for busses with a front splash pan, BTW..) they will go home
crying and frustrated.  It involves disabling either the clutch (recommended)
or brake petal so that they can't pull it back up.  Its unconventionality will
absolutely stump any would-be thief because they are used to looking only for
the common things to do to a vehicle to steal it.  Most wouldn't have a clue
as to where to start to &quot;fix&quot; the bus to get it rolling again.  And if they
did, it would take them a while and they would be lying on the ground under
the bus to do the fixing - not the kind of envorinment thieves like, what with
all of the people walking by asking if &quot;everything is alright&quot; or &quot;can I call
the police or a wrecker for you&quot; going on.

By the way, how do you get a hold of that CD?  I had gotten all of the files
off of the internet when he was active on the list, but I lost them in a
crash.  Now I've heard that the CD is NLA for some reason having to do with a
dispute.  Anyone?  

TIA

Listees,

I've seen a few posts on &quot;protecting you bus&quot; and have some ideas, but how
do people keep their bus theirs? I have been considering a fancy alarm that
just kills the ignition. Obviously, it could do a lot more, but I'm just
looking for ways to prevent the vehichle from being started up. I have a
locking engine lid, was planning on *some* kind of ignition kill, and maybe
an empty distributor wire coming from the coil. Any other ideas? Thanks
for any suggestions anyone may have.

Paul
