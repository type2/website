If you keep mileage over a longer period of time,
the variances of fill accuracy and pump accuracy
diminish and a accurate average mileage can be 
calculated.

For diagnostic purposes, checking for trends of
mileage differences over time, just be consistent.
Same gas station, same pump, same fill level.  Using
the same pump and letting the auto-shut-off determine
the fill level is the easiest.  Don't let the pump
jockeys in Oregon top it off.

I5 in Oregon is one of the best places to calibrate
your odometer.  There is a mile marker every mile 
from California to Washington.  That's 305 miles
of highway to use.  My '67 Sqbk odometer showed to
be accurate to within .1%!  Speedometer is a little
tougher to calibrate, but after you do your odometer,
any long flat stretch of road will do.
