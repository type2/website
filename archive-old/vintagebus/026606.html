    I have a Hazet wrench which I bought from a VW mech..It has the 21mm. box on
one end and
the 17mm hex on the other.The best part about it are the offsets on both ends are
a perfect fit for the oil strainer, trans and r.b.plugs.My favorite and most used
tool in my bag!!
                        woody

ps. I always remove my wheels also!! Ever try to get gear lube off white wheels!
It actually stains the paint!

&gt; &lt;&lt;  Snap-on has a super neat wrench just for changing gear oil and engine oil.
&gt;  1 end has the 17mm hex and the other end had a 22mm box. It has a slight
&gt;  offset and you can remove reduction box plugs with tires on. It sells for
&gt;  aroung $50.00 but I think it is worth it. Check with your local Snap-on
&gt;  dealer.
&gt;   &gt;&gt;
&gt; make that 21mm on the other end, drain your fluids with one wrench that feels
&gt; good in your hand.  But I like the 17mm bit that goes on the ratchet, easier
&gt; to ratchet than  use a wrench, aren't I lazy?  Break it loose with the snap
&gt; on tool though.  Still remove tires, don't want geasr oil on them.   Poor
&gt; snap on guy, was all confused when I wanted to buy tools.
