Non- bus (but related...)

As someone that once worked for UPS in college for 2 years, I give the company
credit.  No, I am not replying coz I am offended, and I am sure that offense was
not meant.  Thom is right...  They move an enormous amount of material.

For example, when employed there 15 years ago, I was required to sort 35 pieces
per minute, and I would do this for 4-6 hours (per day) during the regular
season, and 9-12 during the holidays.  And there were 10 of us sorting in a rural
California city (Salinas).  We used to have 10-25 bob tail trailers a day coming
into our hub, loaded with packages.  Special handling was given to &quot;odd&quot; shaped
material, and we were &quot;written up&quot; by non-union supervisors for mishandling the
packages.  Packages could weigh up to 70 pounds (then).

By the percentages, some damaged packages are inevitable.  But believe me, they
work very hard to prevent losses and balance this with high productivity.  As
they ultimately pay for the losses and the inefficiencies.

Finally, I again agree with Thom in the key being in the packaging.

&gt; When you package something, you have to realise that it's going in
&gt; with several hundred other boxes, which have to loaded and unloaded
&gt; *by hand* very rapidly between the depot and the truck.  Your box
&gt; will end up under stuff that is much heavier, with several others on top
&gt; of that, and be handled quite roughly.  Face it, they are not going to
&gt; try and handle each package with kid gloves.  These guys have to
&gt; move thousands of boxes in a short amount of time.
&gt;
&gt; Knock on wood, but nothing I've ever shipped UPS has been broken, because
&gt; I overstuff it, knowing it's going to have a rough journey.  I think
&gt; a lot of shippers just don't give a damn once they have your money.
&gt; I got a tonka fire truck set one time that was wrapped in a single layer
&gt; of newspaper and set loose in a box!  Another time a 911 H5 headlight
&gt; assembly was just set in a box with NOTHING!  You can imagine what it
&gt; looked like when I got it...

&gt; &gt; EJ better hope nobody on the list works for UPS and delivers in his area...
&gt; &gt; he'll never get a straight panel again ;)
