Ronnie said
&gt; How many of us carry work clothes and a work mat in
&gt; our buses, or do we all
&gt; believe that our buses don't break and don't need
&gt; them?
And Everett said:
&gt; That's lame, I prefer to mess up all my good
&gt; clothes.

What are good clothes?  Ronnie got upset when I
crawled into Dawn's engine compartment at the campout
after OCTO to help w/ her clutch in the t-shirt I just
bought from him.  But when you're broken down, you
just need to get it fixed.  Almost all of my clothes
are work clothes.  Hmmm, guess I've got to buy
something to wear for my daughter's wedding...
