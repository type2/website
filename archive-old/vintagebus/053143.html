Subject: Nizza tents?

Hey everyone,

I saw Nizza brand tents on the second link below and was
wondering if anyone knows when they started making these? Were
they options for bays, vanagons, and euros? I have a friend who
has a couple of these and he wants to know what years of busses
they work best with. Any info would be appreciated!

I've had one of these on my '74 Westy for the past 6 months and
love it.  It
clamps to your rear hatch and allows access to the engine
compartment.  You
can also open your hatch with the rack installed.  This is a
great way to
carry 2 bikes.  The unique clamps will work with all types of
frames.

We also sell bus tents from $295.00
