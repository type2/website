Subject: bob hoover in the tittie mags!!

The new VWTrends has a cam article by non other than Bob Hoover!!  His
usual no-nonsense self, too, berating all the after-market crapware folks
whose ads fill the rag!



I must say, hats off to the mag for allowing the prophet into a temple full
of moneylenders.   :)

Sadly, they printed a NICE version of a degree wheel for TDC in the CENTER
of the mag, rendering it useless as a free thang you could xerox, cut out
and use.

Next ish has part two of cam-dialing/TDC - can't wait!
