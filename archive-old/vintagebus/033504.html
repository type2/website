Subject: Re: [VB] Tool #

Speaking of tools, got a Sears tool flyer today, had a set of about 7 
wrenches, open end and box end with -ratchets- in 'em. About $10 each on 
sale. No mention of metric or english. I'd buy a 17mm and 13 if anybody 
here says they're worth it.  Speaking of tools, I rummaged around at a swap 
meet and found a 19mm Hazet wrench. Pretty nice, feels great. Now I spend 
too much time staring at piles of wrenches looking for more. Karl and I 
found some big ones about a year ago, I kept the 32mm, he took the useful one.

&gt;Hey NQ
&gt;I just picked one up at Sears right off the
&gt;shelf...considering how often I would ever use the
&gt;tool, I'm fine with Craftsman on this one.
