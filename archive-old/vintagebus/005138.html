Subject: [VB] Cutting up 64 Kombi ?  (long)
Date: Thu, 2 Mar 2000 10:04:48 -0800
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

Have a parts bus for the front nose( UN hit ) and for the doors( no dents)
the W. Yard just put it on the driveway! I have some questions : When I cut
it up, is there a market for  the walk through seats and floor they sit on?
the back end I thought I could cut it in front of the corners over the top
in 1 Big section (roof is rusted out) the cargo floor is is good shape... I
could haul these to a swap meet  or is it a waste of my time?  Also what to
use to cut it up ?  I know my wire feed welder will cut up bus sheet metal:)
but I don't have a gas welder. How about a Circ. Saw with a metal cutting
blade? I have a sawzall but I think I would snap a lot of blades !  Any
Ideas would be a big help.       Lloyd in Eureka, Calif
