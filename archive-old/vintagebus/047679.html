Hi T Tacker,
Yes, tar is the best way to not only seal the window seal to the body, but 
the glass to the seal to prevent the white haze of water damage when using 
laminate glass.  It also is great because it lubricates the seal when being 
installed and repels rust!  Even if you live in a dry area it is a good idea 
to use tar so when the weather in your area decides to take a dump or you 
move or just take a trip to a rainer part of the country.   Eric&amp;Barb
