Subject: Re: [VB] high pressure/Oil filter/cold issues

&gt; It's even stated in
&gt; the Bently manual that 10w30 oil is rated &quot;All the year&quot;. The only thing
&gt; thicker that they recommend is 30w, but only in temps of 86 degrees
&gt; farenheit or higher. Not a whole lot of places where it's 86 degrees when
&gt; you go to start your vw up in the morning.

Not sure what you were reading when you wrote this....
I think you meant 40 weight?? If yes, the chart in the 68-79 says it starts at
20C / 68F.

From the 63-67 Bentley, section S-3, page 9:
from 0C / 32F = SAE 30
to     30C / 86F = 20W/20 or SAE 30

From the 68-79 Bentley section 9, page 5. There is a viscosity chart pictured.
SAE 30 is listed for temps from 0C / 32F to 25C / 78F.
The 20W/20 that the 63-67 listed as being the same temp range as SAE 30 is
shown on this chart differently.
Minus 10C / 17F to 10C / 50F.

From the back of a brand new bottle of Castrol 30:
&quot;Use above 40F&quot;
