however, you do not need a plugged heat riser for carb icing.  it will of 
course be then manifold icing as well with a plugged heat riser.   You can 
have a fresh clean heat riser and have carb iciiing.  At 60 F.  Or at 34F

 Correct, because what causes the freezing is the temperature drop that
 occurs in the manifold.
 
 Vaccum leaks will also cause this.
