Subject: Custom bus exhaust for sale

I need to sell my exhaust to finance another project that i'm working on.

It is a dual hide-a-way, where exhuast goes through one muffler, then through
another. Extremely good ground clearance, and super quiet. Virtually no
exhuast tone at idle, and very little while driving. Performance seemed the
same as with a single quiet pack on my 1600 running single carb.

Bad part about it is, you must remove muffler(s) to adjust valves (takes about
10 minutes to remove).

Here's a link to what it looks like for as long as geocities will let you in:

Too large to ship, but can take it to either Sacto or Vegas BOR (or pick up
here in SLC).
