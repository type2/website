65mph _at_ 3399rpm, 77mph _at_ 4000rpm.

Split Bus combonations converting to straight axles:

4.37 R&amp;P, .89 4th, and 195/50r15 (22.67&quot;) tires
65mph _at_ 3741rpm, 69mph _at_ 4000 rpm.

65mph _at_ 3537rpm, 74mph _at_ 4000 rpm.

3.88 R&amp;P, .89 4th, and 195/50r15 (22.67&quot;) tires
65mph _at_ 3333rpm, 78mph _at_ 4000 rpm.

Type 1 powered bay window buses (stock):

5.375 R&amp;P, .82 4th, and stock 25.7&quot; tires
65mph _at_ 3741rpm, 69mph _at_ 4000rpm.

Type 4 powered bay window buses (stock):

4.857 R&amp;P, .89 4th, and stock 25.7&quot; tires
65mph _at_ 3688rpm, 71mph _at_ 4000rpm.

Interestingly, even with the extra cooling of a T-4, the tallest VW geared it
was the equivelant of putting a 3.88 R&amp;P into a stock big-nut trans. The 1971
Bay window bus, with the 1600DP (pretty equivelant to us putting 1600DP's in
our splitties), is only doing 169rpm less at 65mph than the stock trans. A
stock big-nut trans only spins the motor 222rpm more than a T-4 powered bus to
do 65mph. Interesting info, seems VW had a &quot;sweet spot&quot; they liked to keep
these motors running at.

Other than 195/50r15's, I wasn't sure what other size tires people like to run
when they do straight axle/IRS conversions. If someone tells prefered tire
sizes and gear combo's, i'll add it to the list.
