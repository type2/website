Subject: RE: Sound Proofing

In my humble opinion, there is NO equivalent to Dynamat -- at least, not if 
by &quot;equivalent&quot; you are referring either to &quot;Brown Bread&quot; or &quot;Fat Mat,&quot; 
which are Dynamat alternatives.  The &quot;alternatives&quot; are thinner, harder to 
apply, less durable, more likely to peal, and just don't have the same sound 
deadening capabilities. I have used both in my cars -- and have ended up 
either pulling up the &quot;alternative&quot;, or only using them as a second coat 
over a layer of Dynamat.

For redoing the interior of my splitty, as part of my complete 
resto-customization, I purchased four, 36-sq-feet bulk packs of Dynamat 
Extreme and two boxes of Dynamat Hoodliner.  I literally double-layered 
every square inch of the inside of my bus, EXCEPT for the front doors 
(because they tend to collect so much moisture) with the Dynamat Extreme.  I 
then put a layer of hoodliner in the engine compartment and another on top 
of the Dynamat over the engine hump inside the bus, and then put a layer of 
insulation (NASA aluminum-coated felt) followed by a vapor barrier 
everywhere I put Dynamat.

The above, combined with dual quiet-pack mufflers makes for a VERY quiet 
ride.  And as far as the worries about anything rusting under the Dynamat 
goes -- as long as you properly seal, prime, paint, and clear-coat the metal 
(as I did) and don't expose it to undue moisture, you shouldn't have to 
worry about rust.  Again, the inside of those front doors are an exception.  
For them, I just POR-15'ed the heck out of them and used small strips of 
Dynamat to deaden the loudest areas of offense -- like the door locks -- 
take care to keep away from any of the drain paths for the water.

Good luck!

Richard
