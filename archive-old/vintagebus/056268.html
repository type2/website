Subject: Re: [VB] crew cab headliner

&gt; Also, the set I found has a little water damage on some of the pieces...
has anyone ever tried to steam and then straighten a panel before????  Also,
should the sheen of the panels be glossy or more of a mat finish?
&gt;
I tried to straighten a Type 3 door panel a looooong time ago by dampening
it with a spray bottle and then stacking some phone books all over it.  It
worked but not to the level I had hoped.  In retrospect, I think I needed
more weight on it.

The original panels on my ex-'54 Single Cab had a matte finish.

How are you going to mount the panels when the screw holes won't line up?
