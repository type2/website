Subject: re: engine black paint...

Hey David,
Have you tried Chassis Black from Eastwood? It is a semi-gloss paint and
is a Epoxy spray paint so it dries super hard. It is expensive but
Eastwoods marketing says something about &quot;high solids content&quot; makes it
cover more. It actually does. One can lasts a long time. It takes a
while to dry and you need to make sure that stuff is prepped properly
but it holds up well and is formulated to match the color and sheen of
the semi gloss chassis on alot of American cars.
hope this helps,
Craig
