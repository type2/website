Subject: Re: [VB] Re: Adjusting the Ring and Pinion

That is exactly the book that I am using to rebuild my tranny. The 
problem is the 3.88 is extracted from a 1973 (by memory?) transmission 
and the Bentley only deals with pinions that have the &quot;r&quot; number 
written on them. The 3.88 pinion contains absolutely no numbers. The 
ring gear only has the ratio stamped on it. I am hoping that someone 
has made a '67 or earlier freeway flyer before and has run across this 
problem.

&gt;&gt; I am installing a 3.88 Ring and Pinion into the tranny of my '67 EZ
&gt;&gt; Camper. What is the proper way to determine the size of shims that are
&gt;&gt; needed for the pinion gear and the differential housing?
