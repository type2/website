Subject: Confusing timing feedback...

I am trying to get my 60 Double Cab ready to drive up to the Vintage
meet in Seattle. It is almost a 300 mile trip one way so I need to have
it pretty dialed in. Anyway I was checking the timing and when I put the
light on the #1 wire it skips around from TDC to all kinds of various
places. When I put it on #2 it stayed dead steady at 180 degrees out.
The other side wires were the same. The piston _at_ 180 degrees out gave a
steady reading where the one at TDC bounced all over. I had a different
dizzy in there before but can't remember if it did it with that. I am
running a Pertronix in a German 009. It this an indication of a bad
dizzy? I don't see how it could be the Pertronix. The motor is a 1776
with dual Weber 40 IDF's. I am kind of in a hurry on this as I only have
today and tomorow to get this dialed. Any ideas would be appreciated.
thanks in advance,
Craig
