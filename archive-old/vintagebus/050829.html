Subject: Re: [VB] Buying bus parts



&gt; &gt; if you don't know what a part looks like or what it's called, why
&gt; &gt; are you even working on the car in the first place?

Because I love my bus. I love working on my bus.

I've pulled the engine, transmission, suspension, etc. put it back 
together and it worked fine. I'm doing it again ten years later - why 
should I have to remember the part names, numbers, etc. I've had my bus 
for 20 years, why should I trust some shop I just met! ;-)

I replaced the rotors, calipers and pads on the front of my Volvo 240 
wagon using my Bay Window bus manual. What's the big deal? It worked 
fine. Why should I take it to an expensive Volvo shop 'cause I don't 
have a Volvo manual?

I placed an ad for parts - the website is in Sweden! As a result I found 
a parts store in Denmark! How did I do this? The place had a website. 
They had parts I could use. On the other side of the world, using 
'thesamba_dot_com' I emailed a guy in Argentina - he's looking for sunroof 
parts for me.

When I first entered this market, I joined SOTO because that was the 
ONLY way I could find out about who sold parts. My dues paid for a 
photo-copied newsletter. (still have the newsletters if anyone is 
interested) As a result, I got a Bus Boys catalog (and still have it) 
and bought a steering box and replaced it on my bus - having never done 
it. Worked just fine.

And what an great resource this forum has been - all via email.

And as for Hoover's Sermons, they are archived on a website (and now on 
my hard disk):
