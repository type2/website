Subject: travel postcard from P &amp; C

Date: Oct 25, 2003

This leg of the trip seems to be our critter time.   We left Las Cruces and wandered up to the White Sands National Monument where we had to wait for tarantula crossings.  (see the postcard)   We wandered over to Carlsbad Caverns and explored the caves.  Catherine was surprised by a ring-tail cat that had come in a long ways into the cave.  We then sat out until very late waiting for the bats to leave the cave.  Seems they got a little shy and wanted to wait for cover of dark - or near dark.

In Big Bend National Park in Texas we took a primitive camp site about a mile off the main road.  The nearest neighbor was a half mile further down at the end of the road.  We drove down to Cottonwood area one day and stopped in the campground for a nap and to fix lunch.  At lunch  we were joined by a band of javelins and a turkey who would not say no.  Then next day we drove the eastern route and when we stopped for lunch we were joined by a turkey vulture missing a talon.  Later that afternoon we ran across a herd of burros playing.  

We left Big Bend Park and headed west along the Rio Grande.  What a roller coaster ride.  Had a 35% grade?  First gear and we barely made it.  We left the river and headed north to Balmorhea State park where the spring puts out about 1 million gallons of water an hour at about 76 degrees.  The pool is set around the spring and contains 3.5 millions gallons of water.  There were fishes to swim with and even turtles.
 
We are now back at Las Cruces with friends Bill and Janet.  We went to a Chevy show this morning.  There is a VW show tomorrow then we will be headed west again Monday morning.  Plans to stop in the Gila National Forest in west NM to test the hot springs then on to Flagstaff, AZ to pick up parts.  From there a stop in Lake Havasu, AZ and maybe a last night or two on the road in Joshua Tree National Park, then home?

We had such a good time at Big Bend National Park in Texas and as we traveled (and were so out of touch) that we ended up with 3 postcards.  The latest one is posted at

then click on Previous postcard to get to the other two.
