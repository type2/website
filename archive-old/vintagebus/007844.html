FWIW... don't hold out for a cheaper flight,, grab the good priced one Right
AWAY.... DON&quot;t ask me how *I* KNOW that they get way to expensive to book
one closer than 7 days to an Event ,,,an Event that I knew was coming since
Buses By The Balloons!!!

Make sure you have a great time.... write lavish trip reports that are full
of BS and rub my nose in it again!
Maybe I'll learn to stop procrastinating!!

Double Cab..... And I already Miss the WARMTH!! Grrr,,, I had a chance to
Git with the Wife in a double cab at midnight at Havasu,, to make up for the
fact we were apart on NEW YEARS!
