Hey all,

Can someone enlighten me on what all connects to the hot side of the coil on 
a 73 type 1 DP ghia engine in my deluxe?  I replaced a melted coil and fixed 
some wires to find one hot wire that fell off and seems to short to go 
anywhere.  My battery was pretty dead and finally got my bus running with a 
jump from my GTi but it ran rough! Seemed like mayby lacking a cylinder.  
Took the jumper cables off and it died before I could hit the throttle, 
couldn't get him to run after that.

The original wires to the coil were shady and I think the hot ones were 
grounding out...could this melt a coil?

Thanks guys,

Eric
66 Deluxe
