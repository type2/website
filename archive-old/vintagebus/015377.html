There was a big thread on this a while back.  The guy has a number of
different online aliases - which is a warning sign to me - and seems to
have outstanding issues with a number of different people.  He posted a
message to the list claiming to have solved one of them, and claimed the
people were stupendously happy with the outcome, but I'll bet a donut
they were just happy to have their bus back.
