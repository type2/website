Subject: Re: [VB] popin' outa 4th/vinyl einstein
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

When I bought My 67 westy walk through, it had started poping out of 4th 2 
years prior. the po, a man of many talents (Also very cheap) fabricated an 
incredible bracket to hold it in place. it bolted in place at 4 spots between 
the seats and had an arm that came up and hooked around at precisely the 
right spot, so you could pull the lever around it easily, but it diddnt pop 
out. when it finally did start popping out, I was able to tweak the hook part 
and make it work again. not as easy to shift into, but it still held. gotta 
love a bus.

 po also worked in a sign shop and applied vinyl graphics to the westy, 
Albert Einsteins face (Huge) below the belt line in white(to match the top) 
and imagination is more important than knowledge in blue( to match the 
bottom) down the belt line covering 3/4 the length of the bus. I would have 
to agree that for the vintage look, an old school sign painter is the way to 
go. vinyl is nice in that it can easily be removed for a buses resale, but 
just doesnt have the same feel. maybe some universal logos painted on, with 
the url in vinyl ? maybe not.
