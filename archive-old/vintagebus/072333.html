&gt; I'm replacing my old felt/metal grease seal with the new-type rubber seal 
&gt; and need to know which way to seat the seal.

Hi Scott,
Those and the later types are reusable.

  Does the cupped side with the metal  &gt; spring face towards the inner 
&gt; bearing/race or towards the spindle?

Bearing/race.

&gt;&gt;  Also, should that seal sit flush with he drum?&lt;&lt;

Should, but we have had some just barely stick out.  Measure the bore for the 
seal to see if it should be recessed.
