I've had the new bus for 2 days now and I'm making good headway with the
fundamentals--
oil change, valve adjustment, tire pressure, etc.  Unfortunately, I
think it needs a new steering box.  Today, as I was driving straight
down the road, I felt it tighten up.  I could still turn the wheel, but
it was stiff until I gave it a hard pull back and forth. Then it
loosened up.  When I got home, I played with the adjustment (tighter and
looser) but nothing seemed to help.  The cheapest rebuilt I've found so
far is $230 exchange (bummer).  I was also disappointed when, after
replacing the shift linkage coupler, I felt no improvement at all.  This
has got to be the sloppiest shifting vehicle I've ever driven.  Maybe I
should have started at the front of the linkage.  Oh, well!  Otherwise,
I love driving it around town.  I'm amazed how rattle free and smooth
riding it is.

I plan to formalize the restoration process using MS Project, mostly to
keep an accurate record of time and money spent in each area of the
process.  I'd sure appreciate any input regarding critical sequences
that someone doing this for the first time might miss (I can figure out
that body work and rustoration comes before paint).  Also, suggestions
about how to deal with the shift linkage and steering problems will be
appreciated.
