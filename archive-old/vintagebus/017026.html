Subject: After a year as a Bus owner...

I've been off the list for a while but I thought I just Post my word of joy 
for the day. One year ago yesterday I purchased my first bus. Six weeks ago 
I got it on the road finally and three weeks ago it put putt putted me 900 
miles from Indiana to South Dakota.(At 55mph :) I've learned from the bus 
that  being the slower vehicle is a much more relaxing driving experience. I 
don't have to worry or stress about passing others they just have to worry 
about me being the slow one.  It's been a happy year and a lot of fun.  The 
work on the bus keeps me out of trouble and who knows maybe it really will 
be a chick magnet and help my social life...If I can tear myself away from 
the garage long enough for a date. Oh well we can dream. ;)

Scott
