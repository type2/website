I use Hagerty as well. They are particular about pics and garage
construction details, but so far so good.

Subject: [VB] Interesting Insurance Issue



I signed up with Hagerty to insure the 60 DD panel, and
as part of the process I had to send them pictures.  I
raised some concerns with them, and they weren't going
to insure me, because of the &quot;VintageBus_dot_com - Unauthorized
Parts and Service&quot; written on the side!  They thought I
was using the bus commerically!  I had to talk the
rep into going onto the web and looking at my site, to
verify that it was *not* a commerical enterprise.

FWIW, its' $92 to insure it with Hagerty, vs ~$500 with AAA
