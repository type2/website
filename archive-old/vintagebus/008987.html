This is not for the vintage nazis, but I replaced my switches with new ones from a hardware store. Their are many different styles and sizes to choose from - just find one that looks good :-) I picked up a third one to fix a flashlight. OTOH, a fellow SV2s member is missing the cover for one of those Westy side lights. The opaque rectangular thing that the switch pokes through. Anyone have a source for these.....?
