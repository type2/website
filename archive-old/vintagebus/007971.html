I say - put what ever you want in your bus.  If you want to drive around
with a load of cow manure on a hot summer day - go for it,  I just can't
understand why you would want to!

My 60 has the original tranny and the motor from a 61  beetle,  it has P&amp;C's
of an unknown (to me) size but I'd guess it is no more than 1500 cc's - I
love it,  that's right - LOVE IT.  Maybe if I was in some big city with lots
of freeways I'd feel differently - but I don't think so.

I drive it really easily to maximize engine life and gas milage.  I get
approx 31 mpg (Imp.) on the highway.  I run the 28 Pict and I have no
interest in using any other carb.  I get between 50 and 60 mph (so the
speedo says)  and that's fine with me.  As soon as I get a good place to
work I plan on attempting to rebuild a motor - just to do it - and I want to
build one exactly like the one I have now.

If I wanted a V-6 I would just go and buy a t*y*ta, or a ch*v or something.
I seems to me that if you are so unhappy with your bus as to put a V-6 in
it, then you just shouldn't be driving a bus!

As well, consider - what would a V-6 powered bus be worth - I know, for me,
the closer to stock the bus is the more I would pay.  There is a Yahoo in
Winnipeg here who has an early bus body on, what looks like, a 4-wheel drive
chasis.  I passed by him one day and he gave me this big sh*t eating grin -
like he expected me to say: &quot;way to go dewd&quot; - I just looked away - what
would I say to someone like him? - what would I have in common with him?

But - it's your bus - do whatcha want - and good luck with whatever you
decide.

jdd - puttin' slowly along in the Mango Warrior ;)
