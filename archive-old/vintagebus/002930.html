&gt;I keep seeing claims of &quot;NOS, No Longer Available&quot; for bus wiper blades on
eBay,
&gt;which is setting off my BS detector.  The last time I was at the VW
&gt;FLAPS, they had them on the shelf.  Am I on glue, or are the ebay sellers?


Gotta agree with you hear Thom.  My BS dectector is pegged.  When it comes
to wiper blades for our old buses, you can get ones for an early jeep that
work just as well and at much less cost.  Heck, maybe that is what the guy
is selling as NOS - jeep blades.  Who knows?
