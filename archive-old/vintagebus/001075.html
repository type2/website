Looks pretty neat - I wonder how well it works. I purchased a Mighty Vac
vacuum bleeder from RMM and have never been able to get the thing to work
right. It just always seems to suck air bubbles, no matter how many times I
try. I finally gave up and went back to the ol' two-person method. I
couldn't get it to work on my motorcycle either, but bleeding that is only a
one person job anyway. Has anyone tried one of these Mighty Vacs? In
principle, it seems like it should work.

Hey all - on the vintagvw list, they've been talking about these
speedbleeders you can get for your bugs.  www.speedbleeder_dot_com
It really looks like a neat gizmo to have and I'd like to get set but I
didn't see anything listed for a pre-71 buses.  Does anyone know the
measurements off hand so I can submit them and see if they have something
that would work?  Doing brake bleeding always has seemed like a PITA to me
so anything to make it easier (and safer) I'm game for it.
