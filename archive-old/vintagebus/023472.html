&lt;&lt; Well, I took the heads to the machine shop, and it looks like a broken 
gasket
 is the problem with #3.  Unfortunately, the other head is cracked.  Both 
heads
 have been rebuilt before, and they say they might be able to fix the cracked
 head.  Is this sketchy?
  &gt;&gt;
are these SP or DP?    DP heads are generally cracked.   You should get 
uncracked cores to rebuild- if you have sp they are very easy to find, in 
fact the machine shop should trade you a pair of sp cores for your good dp 
core.
