I dont know about you, I went to Indy once, big beer drinkin, littering
crosscut of america that did not impress me, maybe when i was a 
teenager, but not now. Anyways whilz i was workin on my 10 window
(greenhouse), listenin to national public radio emanating from within
the fine acoustic properties of an oversize tin of luncheon meat, These
properties only exist when bus is parked, engine off :&gt;) Seems there
was quite a riot out in Reno this weekend with over 100 arrests, i 
did chuckle thinking we will have a first hand report here on the list.
In any case A Hot August night sounds like a cross between A Street
car named Desire and Missisippi Burning...maybe i am Gettin old  :&gt;)
                                                                                 Damon
