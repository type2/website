&gt; I am looking for the name of the peice that the
cargo door's bottom latches go into. I have enclosed a photo of the
actual spot I am looking for. It in between the 2 red lines. &lt;

Chip,

        If your cooler says &quot;Campmobile&quot;, it is from a Westfalia....no
question about it.  Now...whether or not the cooler is original to the rest
of the interior or not is a mystery for you.  I have pix posted of my SO-42
('65) Westfalia interior at:
http://ourworld_dot_compuserve_dot_com/homepages/JJRodgers1/library/so42.htm.

        One thing that I have noticed about the E-Z's is that they &quot;all&quot;
seem to be bench seat models.  Of course, that is based on a very small
test field......I mean....like maybe 5 buses.  Also, &quot;all&quot; of them where
originally PanelVans (VIN 21.....).

        On your sheet metal question, there are three parts to make up the
area that you need.  First, and obviously, the &quot;outer rocker panel&quot; (app.
$40).  It has square holes in the middle of it with tangs that stick up and
go thru the second part, the &quot;outer ten inches of the cargo floor&quot; (app.
$45).  The floor will have the &quot;check plate&quot; that you are looking for
prewelded on it.  Usually, when you replace the &quot;outer rocker&quot;, it is
necessary to replace the &quot;inner rocker&quot; (app. $15).  This piece is simply a
long, skinny piece of channel-iron-shaped sheet metal that tees into your
frame cross supports.  

        You can do all this work with a grinder and a mig-welder quite
easily.  Sometime, maybe we could get together and I could give you a hand
with it.  My labor is pretty cheap.._dot_usually in 12's or 24's.  All parts
prices are quoted via Wolfsburg West, but Das Bulli Haus makes heavier duty
sheet metal parts.

Take care and good luck,

Josh
