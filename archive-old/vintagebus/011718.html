Hi all, 

Thursday at about noon I ran out to the campground to park one of 
my Busses, and as I entered the area there were already about 25 
Type 2's parked, setting up and partying!  The event was already in 
full swing.  The D.B.G. Club had their &quot;Tavern&quot; set up and a electricial 
with the club was wiring their Bar for lights, sound, and for the &quot;band&quot; 
(and wedding!).  Charlie Ford could be seen showering in a &quot;outside&quot; 
shower near his campsite.  The first two arrivals got there Wed 
morning about five minutes apart.  Being the one who runs this event, 
I'm going out with my other Bus and Henry DeKuyper from VW Trends 
on Friday afternoon.  There should be many more Busses in place 
by then!  We hope some of you will be joining us this weekend, and 
if so, please drive carefully on you way.

Bill Bowman
