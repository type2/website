&gt; Sorry the link is bad now for some reason but hey I was able to download
all they had before it went bad. I don't get it but I went back and
found errors.
Anyway go here for your paper model of a truck and a samba
http://hannoverwerks_dot_com/VW_paper_models/
&gt;
I have one of the Deluxe models, I actually thought it was a real VW
brochure.  Maybe it is?  Oh well, I didn't pay much for it.  FYI, it is
printed on very heavy paper.  If someone could translate the instructions,
that would be awesome...

The previous link still works for me:
