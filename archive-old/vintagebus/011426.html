Subject: re organic mechanic / ambulance

I thought i would pass this on to whoever may care.

I ordered a few used parts from a guy in the slocan valley - interior BC
canada - and asked him if he would mind my posting it to the list - he
encouraged it so...

anyway he sold me a 65 bumper complete with overriders for $50 canadian
(that's like 20 cents US) - it does need work but not much in fact i found
a bumper shop that'll repair it too like new condition for another $50 - as
well i got door handles from him for just a couple bucks - he is a real
nice guy - he has an ambulance (i have absolutely no idea as to its
condition - tho i think i have the bumper :)) as well as lots of other vw
bus parts - my understanding is that he is strictly VW but i could be wrong

he is the ORGANIC MECHANIC phone # 250-359-7625 i spoke with Bob 

and to Bob - who, im sure will never read this, sorry i took so long to
post this - but procrastinator thy name is man 

jdd
59 std (or as barb and eric imply - a 60 misregistered as a 59 :)
