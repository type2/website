(I wanted to say feature, but in my line of work, that's bad)

Ever wanted to see your bus on the web, but didn't have the HTML skills or
web space?  Now you can!  Sure, there's other sites that will post your pic
if you send it in, but now you can post a picture and your commentary, and
view it immediately!
