Then one day the head 
&gt; of #4 intake
&gt; valve broke off at 60mph and destroyed the engine in about 
&gt; three seconds.
&gt; 
&gt; If a particular valve gap keeps closing up, take that as a 
&gt; warning that
&gt; that valve is about to fail. Pull the engine immediately and 
&gt; rebuild the
&gt; heads.

Hi George,

If that's the engine that fig showed me I would heed his warning! It was
UGLY.
