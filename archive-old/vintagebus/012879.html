Thanks for the tip.  I knew they had some sort of venting system built in but have no idea how it works or how to fix it.  I'll try the brake cleaner thing.

As far as parking goes, there isn't a hill for 30 miles and I think every time I leave the house I drive 40 miles.  It only gives me problems on left turns so I am thinking of modifying all of my driving routes so they only include right turns.

Thanks
Richard
