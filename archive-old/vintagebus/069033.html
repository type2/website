&quot;Why of course the people don't want war. . . . That is understood. But,
after all, it is the leaders of the country who determine the policy
and it is always a simple matter to drag the people along, whether it
is a
democracy, or a fascist dictatorship, or a parliamnent, or a communist
dictatorship. Voice or no voice, the people can always be brought to
the  bidding of the leaders. That is easy. All you have to do is tell
them they  are being attacked, and denounce the peacemakers for lack
of patriotism and exposing the country to danger. It works the same
in any country.&quot;
