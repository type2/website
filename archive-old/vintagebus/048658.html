Subject: Non-priority work day
Mime-Version: 1.0

Well, I spent the day doing non-priorty VW Bus work. I went ahead and
re-furbed the westy wood slat roof rack that I had picked up for free a
while back. I had already bought new wood and had also previously
clear-coated them. So I polished up the aluminum, bought a bunch of new
fasteners, and put it all together. It really came out nice!

Problem is I can't keep it on my Kombi all the time. My bus won't go into
the garage with the rack 'cause it makes it too tall. So the delima is: do
I park in the garage and don't use the rack, or do I leave my bus outside
all the time and ride in style with the rack on all the time. After A LOT
of thinking over the weeks, I decided that I'd keep the rack OFF most of
the time and put it on every now and then. That way I can keep the bus in
the garage and out of the elements at night and on REALLY bad weather days.
Just make more sense to me right now.

So what do you guys use to insulate the metal on the rack mounting points
and keep it from scratching your paint?
