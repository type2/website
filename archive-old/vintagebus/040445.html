Okay, it's my turn to ask a basic question. My '64 standard has a big red light to the left of the speedo on the the dash. I've seen this on many buses, but missing on my old '67. Is this supposed to go off with the emergency flashers?

This was a factory-installed indicator, wasn't it? Seen on too many buses in the same location not to be.

Thanks! Joe
