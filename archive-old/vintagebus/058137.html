Subject: 5 lug to Porsche EMPI adapters

Well this weekend I splurged and put EMPI wide 5 to Porsche pattern wheel
adapters on the rear of my '66 Bus.

Of course anything from EMPI is crap, so it did not fit out of the box.  The
Porsche pattern was fine (not perfect but close enough).  The 5 lug holes
were too wide and the holes needed ground in so that the lug bolts could
attach to the drum.  The Dremel would take all day so get out the regular
drill and some big grinding bits for this effort.

So after a little cursing and fiddling with the plates the wheels were
mounted.  I tightened all the bolts to 85 pounds.  

...  The tires (small 195/65/R15) are very very close to the fender lip...
Okay so one rolls freely and the drivers side tire rubs.  Tonight I will
yank the tire off and roll the fender lip a little bit...  Absolute worst
case I grind a little of the lip off.

Not sure why the EMPI adapters stick out so far, but I *might* be able to
put the Porsche center caps on which would be cool.  I was counting on
having to look at those ugly axle nuts for a while :)  There is no hope for
the 215/75R15 tires like I want though...  Until I put 944 rear brakes on it
at least.  Long term project in the works.

I placed really ugly tires and wheels from the '67 on the front to get me
motivated for the 944 front brake conversion...  More to come on that
project in the future.


Take Care,
