I am posting this for a friend.  So do not contact me about it.  A great
deal though located in Smyrna Georgia (suburb of Atlanta).

I built the motor with him from pretty good parts.  A perfect type 3 case
purchased from Dave Easterwood and built up from there.  New lifters,
bearings, generator, and clutch.  Used P&amp;Cs, rods, crankshaft, camshaft,
flywheel, and heads.  As a note the stuff was reused because the components
were new 100ish miles before the PO started blowing oil and parked the bus.
The PO decided to use the wrong size main bearings and a torn rear main
seal, which creates lots of noise and oil leaks.  The motor is a great
runner except for a leaky rear main seal, do not know why it is leaking but
could be fixed easily and probably will be for the new owner.  Also in an
attempt to make the motor look stock the 34PICT-3 will be put back on the
motor, too many questions from buyers on why a smaller carb is on there.

The new owner may want to spring for a vacuum advance dizzy which will help
the busses driving dramatically.      

Also it has great brakes and steal at $1000.  

Nuff said, here it is:   ( as a finders fee I will need to keep the Z-bed...

For Sale
1971 VW Westfalia Camper 
First $1000 takes it home.  Not negotiable, it is a steal at this price.

The Good:
	*	Disc brakes in front with new pads and rubber lines.
	*	New brake shoes and wheel cylinders in rear.
	*	New rear shocks.
	*	Good tires, 75% tread left.
	*	New Bosch generator &amp; Bosch voltage regulator.
	*	Rebuilt 1600 Dual Port universal case (type 3) engine &lt; 3000
miles.
	*	Uses the earlier and better 30-PICT3 Carburetor with the 009
Distributor.
	*	Has rare Westfalia child cot.
	*	Has rare Westfalia mosquito netting for camping with the
hatch open.

The Bad:
	*	Rust in the usual spots: front floor and rockers.
*	Needs new front window seal and usual touch ups.
	*	Sliding door rail has a rust spot that the door gets caught
in sometimes.
	*	Missing refrigerator and single person seat behind the
driver.
	*	The pop-top canvas is trashed.
	*	Minor front nose damage from an accident, just a little push
in.
	*	Power brakes are not hooked up, may be a simple job to
attach lines? 

The Ugly:  Just don't have time to work on it!

&quot;The tax man strode into most American lives after the bombing of Pearl
Harbor. To raise a war chest, income taxes - once reserved for the rich -
were extended to all Americans for the first time in history. The expanded
tax was supposed to be temporary, ending with the war.&quot;
Support the FLAT TAX movement.  And shutdown the un-Constitutional and
unfair IRS.
