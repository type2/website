Subject: RE: [VB] Case Bore Size?

&quot;B&quot; cases are 1970 ONLY, single port cases. these cases are unique in the
fact that they have the late style, large oil passageways, but have the
small 6mm oil cooler sized holes where the oil cooler attaches to the case,
and uses late style oil cooler seals. if building a dual port on a &quot;B&quot;
case, you need to drill the holes larger for the oil cooler to fit
(doghouse style). &quot;B&quot; cases also came with one year oil coolers with large
passageways. this was one reason for the need for oil cooler adapter seals.
the stock &quot;B&quot; case/&quot;B&quot; cooler use the late style oil cooler seals.
as far as the size, can't help too much, but it seems like a .010 cut to me
or needs to be cut, as stock new size is 2.5590-2.5597 in, with a wear
limit (on standard) of 2.5601 in. 
yes, the 1600 p/c's will fit fine.
good luck


&gt; [Original Message]
&gt; 1.) On a pre-1965 engine case with a &quot;B&quot; coded engine that was originally
a 
&gt; 1500cc, what was the original case bore size on the number 1 bearing? 
Our 
&gt; case is measuring 2.5745&quot;.... comments?
&gt; 
&gt; 2.) Can you use the 1600cc cylinder bores in a 1500 case without
machining?
