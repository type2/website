&gt; I certainly could stand corrected, but I think that

Jim...just to note, from what i can tell my 66 german delivery camper was
painted beige grey first, then the titan red was applied over that (there
for, the top half color goes all the way down..).  At lesat, for the most
part.  The red in the engine compartment (which may or may not be from the
respray..) does not have any beige grey under it...and the interior is all
beige grey.  Behind the door panels, if i recall (been a while since i had
them off..) it was all beige grey, except where the respray oversprayed in
there...

just what .my. bus has...who knows about all the rest!
