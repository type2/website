Subject: Re: [VB] Steering box seals

ah, I drained and refilled the steering box in my 61 2-3 years ago.   Then 
noticed a slip drip from it.  The other day I drained teh box (less than half 
full) (it was still clean, unlike teh first time I did it it had guck and water 
there) and refilled with a half and half grease/gear oil mix (or maybe I 
leaned a little more to the oil so I could squeeze it through the mustard squeezer) 
This seems to reduce ooze, but the bus does steer not quite so lightly.  Next 
time I'll do a 3:1 mix.  Just to make it thick enough to not drip.    I liked 
the lighter steering better.

cause I'm lazy and don't want to take it apart.

look in the archives - i'm pretty sure i posted a standard FLAPS seal 
# for that when i was tweaking with mine.
