I guess that means that unless someone gets all flakey and GIVES(like hell)
me a pair my new bus will wear the spare set from my '60 doublecab. The deck
on the kombi must be wrong cos it doesn't have the centre brake light or
holes where it was.

I've only seen three sets of the lights you describe and all of them were
still attached to complete buses so I don't rate my chances very highly.

Would it be true to say that a bus fitted with semaphores would not have had
turn signals fitted other than as an accessory?

Later
