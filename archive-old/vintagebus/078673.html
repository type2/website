Subject: VOLKSWAGEN BLUES, A KIND OF LONG LAMENT....

Hi Folks,
Not quite friday yet but thought to post this now. Goin' flying first thing in
the AM with
a buddy in his CESSNA. With this great weather can't stay on the ground any
longer!
Gonna go take some pictures.
Anyway, wanted to ask does anyone else sing these blues.....
or is it just my kharma......??
respectfully
Mike Turner


Volkswagen Blues

Here I sit a staring
at the toes of my old shoes
sufferin' with a case of
mail order
Volkswagen blues

It's Friday and
I'm sittin' here
with nothin' much to loose
so let me tell ya people
how it came to be
this sickness, this affliction
something you'd never choose
the long sufferin', agonizing
mail order
Volkswagen blues

It started 'bout three months ago
A bus bra I could use
a lady from a state
southwest of here cried
her service I should choose.

Just pass some cash
and the colors please
and I will do the deed
and before you know it
you will have
the bus bra that you need

&quot;sounds good&quot; I said
I can handle that
and so this very year
on the first of march
the bucks they flew
certified, and handled
with great care.

The days slipped by
in silence
with nary a mumbling word
the postal web site said
&quot;your bucks are there&quot;
but from the state southwest
not a sound was heard.

On 19 march
in some dismay
and feeling
great dispair
I e-mailed the lady
you know...
to see if she was there.

Ere the day was over,
her reply indeed came back
a great emergency at home
had caused her to lose track.

She had in fact recieved the bread
and furthermore, her message read..
A few more weeks and you'll see
the bra you so desire,
appear in front of thee

Todays
the 30th of April
I've waited patiently
no bra, no bread
I'm wondering
are my bucks history?

This ain't my only tale
of woe and misery
allow me to continue friend
and you will clearly see
why I sit here staring
at the toes of my old shoes
full of remorse and those awfull
mail order
Volkswagen blues.

Just a little while ago
on the Samba
what should I see
some really neat bus parts
they were just right for me!

To the e-mail I went
as fast as I could go
'cause you know how it is on the Samba,
some one else might want 'em
ya know?

A dozen e-mails flew
to this fellow I didn't know
somewhere down in Texas
exactly where it didn't show

It was all to no avail
no reply I ever got
I was left to wonder
was he in some Texas jail?
mabe sitting on a cot?

His ad remains in view today
still on the Samba for sale
but someone else will have to pay
'cause I gave up, he wouldn't reply
to me he'll never sell
I don't wish him ill
but I hope he rots in .........

Another story I can tell
of mail order
Volkswagen hell
in San Diego recently
again some parts I found for me.

I wrote the guy just to be sure
he had the stuff and could be trusted
&quot;Hey no sweat, my man&quot;
&quot;for I have never, ever, been busted&quot;
&quot;your absolutely good to go,
the moment I recieve the dough!

Hmmmm
so once more
by certified jet
the bucks they flew
now what would you be willin' to bet
after flyin' certified jet?
five days later I checked the U.S. postal site
the money arrived the previous night!
and what about my precious parts
well its been three weeks
still none in sight.

and so my friends
now you know
you've heard my tale
of misery 'n woe
why this Friday
my head hangs low

idly staring at the toes
of my old shoes
while sufferin' from
mail order
Volkswagen blues



Have a good week :-)
Mike
