The new ones if 4 pieces and doesn't seem as wide as the originals.  &gt; The old

Hi Volksvan,
We used that when we could not find any better, but not much differance 
between that and gluing in sections of garden hose.  Then we found Bus Depot 
had a sealed foam rubber type of one piece engine lid/ SC side door seal.  
The four piece you have is a rotten product especially because the monoxide 
and the hot engine cooling air behind the bus can easily be sucked into the 
engine compartment.
