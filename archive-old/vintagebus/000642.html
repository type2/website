&lt;&lt; I've got a few questions that I need help with.
 
 First off, my bus doesn't have reverse lights and there is a nice set on a
 bus in junkyard about 30 miles from here.  Is it possible to take the
 nosecone from my 66 bus and drill and tap it for a reverse light switch?

why not find a bus nose cone w/ reverse light switch?
...............................
 Next off, I wanted to know about the front shift rod coupler.  It's been
 giving me major problems.  What I have is something similar to but not
 exactly as Bentley depicts.  Bentle shows a longer tube with 2 screws in it.
 I only have one narrow collar with one twisted off screw in it.

sounds like the picture your have is of an earlier one

I've
 sucessfully drilled it out and proceeded to mash and mar the tubes up quite
 a bit just trying to remove them.  I've taken wd40, a torch, and an air
 hammer and have managed to poke a hole in my rear shift rod tube.  I guess
 maybe I should have just left the damn thing alone but it appeared to me
 that I needed to be able to seperate them so that I can get the front axle
 off when the time comes.  I'm thinking of just hacksawing the rods apart but
 that will really get me nowhere as I won't be able to put them back
 together.
 
 Also, how do the 2 rods seperate?  Does the collar come off or is it
 integral with the forward shift rod?  I think that knowing what it supposed
 to actually be removed will help me take this damn thing apart.  Thanks for
 the help..

 patience.  The correct way of dealing with these situations is with a torch 
and a bunch of water and alternatate hot and cold shocks on the coupler for 
an hour or three.     (why do I know?)   then hopefully the screw(s) 
(depending on year) can be removed without breaking them off.  

The later style forward coupler  goes over where the front shift rod, which 
is a tube, goes over the rear shift rod, which is a rod.  The hole in the 
coupler is threaded, the fwd rod/tube has a hole in it the, rear rear rod a 
dimple, the square headed bolt goes through the coupler, through the tube, 
and settles down with the dimpled rod.   All is happy and they thought it 
would happily ever after until you came along to separate things.  They had 
become very set in their ways and clung together and resist your attempts to 
part them.

yes shock treatment is a wonderfrul thing   After enough hot/cold shock and 
the screw is out, vise grips can be used to carefully rotate the two rods and 
twist them free.   the collar can be carefully tapped down one direction of 
the other.

greasing for reassembly? I repeat this repettitively and redundantly.   
Grease is good.  Chant mantra wise.

though I have seen that people have cut and weld these together, I dislike 
that mightily.   I also had a truck that suffered from lack or reverse until 
I fixed someones not stock shift repair.  A very slight difference in shift 
rod can make the differenc ein finding gears,   I like the stock unmodified 
un cut and welded shift linkage scenario.   I know I am boring, but that's my 
story.
