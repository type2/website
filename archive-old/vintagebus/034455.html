Can anyone tell me what a petrol heater out of a 69/70 camper would be
worth $? I have not seen it yet and owner wants to get rid of it.
he took it out of the camper and sold the bus without it.
Now he want's to sell it.
It has a vw part number and is supposed to be working.
also is this heater different from split screen buses? from bay window
buses?
Any info would be great,

vw sometimes put auxilary heaters made by Eberspacher in the buses.  Yes, the
bay window ones are different, but can be installed in splittys.  There are
12V and 6V heaters, so if your bus is 12V to match the later heater that is
good.  What isn't is that the ducting and control wires are probably gone with
the bus it came out of, which you need for installation, but something can
probably be rigged up.   You can test it on the ground with a battery and a
can of gas.     A working one is worth maybe $100 here (seen them for more and
for less, but that sticks in my head), but prices vary.  There are other brand
heaters been put in buses, I have also seen Stewart Warmers, (were those
deealer installed?) and maybe some other kind too.

They use a lot of petrol, (gas eaters (sic) John Muir), but are good for
camping and to get the inside of the bus warm and windows defogged quickly
upon start up.   Not a substitute for a good working stock heater system, or
you will pay in fuel prices, and also not a substitute for fixing drafty doors
and windows.   If it is a bus you will drive when it is freezing outside, a
gas heater makes life quite pleasant.
