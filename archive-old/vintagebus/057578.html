&gt;   Thom, what ever became of your trailer project. I never saw completed
&gt; pics?

It's in a perpetual state of &quot;almost done&quot;  I haven't yet got 'round to
installing the westy top, and I have to jump thru a bunch of rigamarole to
get it licensed.  The nice lady _at_ DMV told me I actually have to have to
arrange for CHP to come to my *house* for a VIN verification on it!

I submitted my plans and permit app for my new shop last week, so the trailer
is on the back burner for now.
