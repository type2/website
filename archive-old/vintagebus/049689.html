Hey Volks

This is a quick trip report on a short camping trip from a while back. I
wrote the report at the time, but I've just found it, unsent, in my out
tray. Just pretend it was last weekend ;-)
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
Saturday morning early I loaded up my 63 Dormobile and was joined by my
friend Adrian and his 5-year-old daughter Kaya in their &quot;Fleetline&quot; bus
(1975 South African-assembled Brazilian splittie).

We set out in convoy on the freeway to my sister's house to fetch my two
girls, Giulia (5) and Laura (3), before continuing in convoy north-west out
of Johannesburg on secondary roads, headed for the Magaliesberg mountain
range, about 80km (50mi) away. Adrian and I are usually climbing partners.
We'd both drawn babysitting duties while SOs did their own things for the
weekend, so we thought the children would enjoy a one-night camping
adventure.

Our destination was a private nature reserve and rest camp called Mountain
Sanctuary Park. The buses both ran well the whole, hilly way, including
over the final 15km stretch of gravel, which grinds up and over a
second-gear pass. When we got to the camp, there was a very clean, straight
late-50s Kombi already at one of the sites (it had 63-71 oval taillights
and fish-eye front indicators fitted, but still had semaphores). With our
arrival the place looked like an impromptu split-screen VW bus meet.

The camp has all the benefits of an organised camping site, as well as
being within easy walking distance of two deep kloofs (rocky ravines)
belonging to the Mountain Club of South Africa. We met up with some other
climbing friends on Sunday, so we managed our ulterior motive of getting in
some top-rope climbing practice while not neglecting our babysitting
duties, and the children enjoyed being out in nature and &quot;hunting for
treasure&quot; in the forest.

The journey back on Sunday late afternoon was accomplished with the usual
slow but determined VW bus gait, but this time in heavy, post-weekend,
going-home traffic. It was a narrow two-lane blacktop nearly all the way
back, with one particularly long uphill slog with few overtaking
opportunities. Inevitably we collected a nice queue behind us but, with a
gravel verge, many pedestrians and failing light, there was no way to pull
over for faster traffic. Once over the crest, though, the fun began,
because the buses could wind back up to the 100km/h (60mph) speed limit,
but there were still very few overtaking opportunities and a lot of
oncoming traffic.

But of course, there will always be the cowboys (who've had lots of time to
choke on bile while our buses slogged up the hill in front of them) who
*must* overtake, even in the face of oncoming traffic, and even though
right ahead of my bus is another car in a long queue of other cars all
maintaining the same 80-100km/h speed I am. Both Adrian and I had to brake
sharply more than once to make space ahead for some moron overtaker trying
to collide head-on with oncomers. We then watched them continue their
reckless antics up the line ahead of us, placing the lives of all around
them in danger to get another car-length up the queue.

We got the last laugh, though, because just before the single-lane opens
out to dual carriageway as one approaches the urban outskirts, the traffic
hangs up at a big crossroad with stop signs all around. Traffic going
straight had a very long queue, while we, bearing left, had a clear run. In
a moment we roared past all the maniacal passers as they waited in the line
to go straight, thumbing our noses as we passed. But they didn't show any
sign of having noticed how easily and safely we cancelled their advantage
in our slow old buses.

The rest of the trip home was on suburban freeways, and uneventful.

PS: For those who got this far. Anyone waiting for Part 2 of my 5 000km
journey in February? Got no response at all to the first half report I
filed in May.
