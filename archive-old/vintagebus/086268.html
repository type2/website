Subject: Re: [VB] LED bulbs was Re: [VB] Re: Speedo Cellophane

I posted about rolling my own LED bulbs some time back and got some
pretty good responses:

I just unsoldered the glass part from some old bulbs, cleaned out the
cement stuff with a drill bit, and soldered in the LED.  Generally the
- side of the LED will have a shorter lead.  For the current limiting
resistors, I switched to using 470 ohm 3 W resistors, and soldered
spade connectors to the ends (one male, one female) so that it plugs
in between the regular wire and the bulb holder.  I still have an
incandescent for the charge indicator.

If the object is to increase your visibility to other vehicles, I
think the best way would be to add some passive lighting in the form
of reflective tape.  I have seen busses with a strip on the bottom
part of the back window and bumper, which was pretty unassuming in
daylight.  There are also paint additives in the form of glass beads
that make paint reflective, so maybe a paint supplier could mix up a
batch of reflective L82 for bumpers and rims.  Fool the Concours
judges by day, and still be seen at night :)
