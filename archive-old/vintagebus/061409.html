Subject: putting together a transaxle

Just called today, and ordered some parts from Rick?,
I think. 
Very helpful, I heartily recommend.

...
&gt; I was searching on the web and found this guy in No.
&gt; Cal, Long Enterprises.
&gt; 
&gt; www.longenterprises_dot_com
&gt; 
&gt; He has some tech stuff and diagrams on his site. I
&gt; think he has all parts for trannies, too.
&gt; 
&gt; Never used him, just a reference.
&gt; 
&gt; Jason
