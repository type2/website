&lt;&lt; s the center section of my '64 beetle transmission compatible with my '66
 bus?
 In other words, will my bug trans swap with my bus trans (center sections
 only)?
 I know the axles are different on the outboard ends to accomodate the redux
 boxes.
 What about the nosecone?
 thanks for any help.

yes, it will  work, FWIW the trans case would have a bug part number in the 
bus.  

yes you must swap nose cones, the bug one will not fit on the bus.

after you take the bug axle tubes and axles off, you must undo the outer ring 
of nuts, and swap the side covers with ring gear side to side. Otherwise the 
reduction gears will cause you to have 4 gears in reverse and one forward.

count the teeth on the ring gear, to find you R&amp;P.  for the tunnel case 
tranny, the pinion has 8 teeth, and the crown gear has 35, 33, or 31 (well 
thats later beetle).  Divide ring teeth (say 33) by pinion teeth (8)  to get 
4.125 or whatever you have.

the center ends of the axles shafts and the crown gears and fulcrum plates 
are the same bus or bug.  Thus you can use the best fulcrum plates and crown 
gears, and compare, probably see that the bug stuff is much less worn.  

be aware that unless someone previously put a bus trans in the bug, you will 
get a lower 4th gear.  Buses came with .82, bugs with .89.  will make some 
difference,  bnut if you just want something to power you around, it'll work 
fine.  The tranny my 65 westy had when I bought it ended up being a 4.12 r&amp;p 
with bug 4th .  worked okay I thought.
