Subject: Re: [VB] Brake MC clarification?

According to cip1_dot_com they recommend the MC listed below to match the
adaptor.

ACC-C20-4100 (adaptor) and VWC-211-611-021-AA (master-cylinder).

The above MC is Brazilian and manufacture by Varga. It comes with a
manufacturer's warranty honored only in Brazil. It is meant to be used with
the brake booster on '72-later busses, but the adaptor plate (which, again I
have yet to purchase and, consequently, try out) is supposed to make up for
the added length of the push tube.

The adaptor is, I believe, manufactured by California Import Parts. I'd like
to know if anyone else out there is making them. Perhaps for a lower price?

&gt;
&gt; There is an additional problem with the adapter.
&gt; Due to manufacturing tolerances, it will fit one
&gt; brand of MC and not another.
&gt; I haven't made the conversion, and can't remember
&gt; the details. Anyone ?
