I meant the cab area...

For instance, if a panel was delivered in Dove Blue, would they have
just painted the outside, or was it common for them to re-paint the
inside as well?   I've seen very few original logo'd panels in person.
One that I can recall is dove blue on the inside and yellow on the outside.
