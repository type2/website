&gt; got a good one.  Getting ready to do the brakes on the Dor and I was
&gt; wondering what the best way to get all the black gunk outta the brake
&gt; reservoir might be.  The openings are too small to stick my finger in.
&gt; I tried swishing brake fluid around but didn't loosen much at all.  Any
&gt; answers?

You can drain it by bleeding the fluid out thru a cylinder, then use
a rag and blunt screwdriver with alcohol to reach in and swab the stuff
out.  YOu can't use anything but alcohol or brake fluid to clean brake
parts.
