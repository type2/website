Subject: Re: [VB] That Darn Vent Glass Seal
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

&lt;&lt; Does anyone have any tips on forcing the vent window glass back into the 
 frame with new WCM seals? &gt;&gt;

What has always worked for me, (although not with new seals), is the 
woodworker's type of Jorgensen clamp.  You just get the glass started, and 
tighten the two screws, and she slips right in!

PS Thanks to everyone who helped or just came to Busses and Balloons (P&amp;C, 
Dawn and Richard (hope you made it home OK), etc;  it was our best turnout 
yet, and that's without Ronnie or VWHoward!  I'm still recuperating from the 
show, including having to change busses to sleep in after my just-on-the-road 
'61 Flip-seat started leaking rain Saturday night!  And Philip, I still 
haven't driven my camper on the freeway!
