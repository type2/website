Hi Zac,
Unfortunitly there are brands of brake lining material have a tendancy for
squeel.  This can also be brought on by weather with high humidity.  Were the
ends of the lining on the shoes tapered?  If not you might want to put on
some grubbys an air filter mask and use a hose style vaccume in the immeadite
area while you file the lining ends (Not the sides!) tapered.  All these
precations are just in case you end up with old stock shoes that have
asbestos in them.  Not something you want to breath alot.  While you are in
there and if you did not have the drums turned check for too much taper.  If
too much taper or the drums are gouged in a ditch like groove then and only
then should you have them turned.  Out of round drums can be straightened by
gently applying the barakes for a week or two.  There is not alot of material
in the VW drums compared to U.S. cars.  Plus the added problem of finding
good replacement drums is not an easy thing.  There are Brazilian drums that
usually are garbage for fronts (Too loose of bearing bores that allow the
bearing races that are supposed to be pressed into the drums to rumble around
while driving.) and maybe or maybe not good for the rears (Too tight of axle
spline hole.).  We have heard recently that replacement drums made in Italy
are reasonably good, but you never know until you try them.  Eric&amp;Barb
