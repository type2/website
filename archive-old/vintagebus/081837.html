&gt;&gt;  oops you are right, got back to looking up some more , looks like the x 
at the  end is for a &quot;DO&quot;  case the &quot;X&quot; at the end means its a 40hp part ,  
basicly its a late
1600 case with 40hp cylinder holes in the case. I have  one under the work 
bench.
The only code i could find for your engine states  it as a 54 36 hp part, the 
same
part  for bug or bus. I didnt look at  my notes good enough before typing , 
oops

Hi Bryan,
Very interesting!  Though it is not our engine, but Vwhoward's.   For some 
reason your Emails are coming to us directly and not through the  vintagebus 
list, so we will pass your info back through the list.
