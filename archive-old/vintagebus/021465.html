I think I can shed some light here, I work for a fuel company in Phx. We haul 
for a lot of places, I was shocked to find out that Chevron is the only place 
that uses a set of racks, no one else can load from these racks, 76 has its 
own rack, and Arco has its own rack. Now Arco, and 76 both sell to any one! 
So you could be at a local &quot;independent&quot; type store and get 76 gas. Now this 
is my point! We have a set of racks called Kinder (Censored), we've hauled 
for 6 different stations out of this one set of racks.

The octane is the same for each different grades of gas unlead is 87 mid is 
89 and high grade is 96. Some times we will be loading and the octane alarm 
will go off at the minimal amount and will not inject any more then that, so 
the gas is at bear minimal as far as grade. usually u get a little extra, 
some times u get a little less! 

Now as far as bad gas, I don't think there is bad gas (persay) if u fill up 
within an hour of an unload u get water with your gas! The tanks drain 6 
inches from the bottom so the water can stay in the tank, but when the tank 
is filled the water is mixed around and suspended for a short time. Giving 
you &quot;bad gas!&quot; 

I can't say anything for the stations I don't deal with but I deal with a lot 
of them!
