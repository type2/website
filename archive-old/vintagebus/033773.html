      Does anybody know how many different markings these lens came with?? I
have 5 different styles (markings) and have just heard of another that I
don't have.

ps. if anybody has close up photo's of TL 58-61 vintage where the markings
are ledgable please send them to me and the year of bus they were on. I am
on a mission to figure out which style of lens came on what bus.
