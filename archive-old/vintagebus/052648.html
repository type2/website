Hi All-

I will soon be in the amrket for replacing the passenger side rocker =
(under the cargo doors)- has anyone used the repro rocker that Wolfsburg =
West sells and if so what is their opinion on its fit and accuracy?

As well the cargo floors have some surface rust on them. What would be the =
easiest (and hopefully least intrusive) way of attacking this rust?

Thanks
