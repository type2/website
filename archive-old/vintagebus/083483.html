Subject: Re: Media vs. Sandblasting

Wow, you're the second ones who have mentioned soda blasting.  I had never
heard of it?  Is it a lot more work or difficult than sand?  Is it easy
enough to get a hold of?  Most importantly, is there any special equipment
that has to be used with it.  Can it be substituted for grit with the
sandblaster?

Aloha, J.D.
