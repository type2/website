I have the generic h4 bulbs in both of my everyother day drivers,1 set has
been in for 3 years and 2 years on my other bus without a failure. The only
problem with these lights are if you are in a busavan, the guy in front of
you will get pis#ed off because of the brightness of the bulbs, so keep your
distance. I sell the bulbs (unit) for 15.00 a piece, have replacement bulbs,
but they are avaiable at any Wallyworld,K-Mart or your local flaps.

Subject: [VB] H4 Halogens on a Splitty??


Hi Everyone,

    I recently saw the article in Hot VWs about installing Bosch H4 halogens
on a '67 &amp; later bug.  That got me thinking, why not on my splitty??  I'm
currently running low-end incandescent 12V lights that don't throw a lot of
light, especially in the valley fog.   Does anyone out there have first-hand
experience installing these on their bus.  If so, how do you like them??
TIA
