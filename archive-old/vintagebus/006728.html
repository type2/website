Subject: [VB] Quality shift coupler?


Do any of you know where I can get a good shift coupler? The one I bought at
the FLAPS is crappy and just refuses to hold one of the bolts in tightly
(after very few miles). Any suggestions as to where to buy a good one (like
maybe one with &quot;VW&quot; stamped on it)? Or should I hit up the junkyard for a
used one? I've heard the ones with red neoprene are ok, but noisy? Forged vs
cast? 

Thanks,
-Wilder
