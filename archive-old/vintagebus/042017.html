&gt; &gt; I'll bet on a broken clutch fork or dropped throwout bearing retainer
&gt; &gt; spring.  These seem to occur on &quot;fresh&quot; clutches for some reason.  I
&gt; &gt; always weld up or replace suspect forks and safety wire the retainer
&gt; &gt; springs.  This failure seems to illustrate Murphy's law rather well.
&gt; 
&gt; Exactimundo.  I pulled the engine last night and one of the arms on the 
&gt; fork had bent away from the input shaft about 1&quot; at the end, with the 
&gt; release bearing sitting there loose.  The weld at the shaft gave way. 
&gt; Not exactly sure why.  There doesn't appear to be any other damage.

The forks were welded in two places and they seem to fatigue after a mere
30 years or so.  I usually weld them all the way around and I notice a lot
of replacement forks come that way.

The other breakage point on the old-style forks is the half-circle cutouts
where the bearing rides.  These get deeper and deeper until the end of the
fork breaks off.  You could weld up the opening, but a new fork is much
easier to do!
 
&gt; The arm looks usable if it were welded back, but I'm going to see if the 
&gt; FLAPS has one in stock.  What's the conventional wisdom on this - are 
&gt; replacement shafts shoddy?  Would I be better to have the original shaft 
&gt; welded up real good-like?  This is a stock vehicle.

Actually, the dune buggy folk have much stronger arms built for stiff
clutches.  They also have wider arms with the spring clip sitting in a
hole rather than a notch.  Definitely worth it if you're replacing the
arm.
 
&gt; &gt; I dug around and found some better clips (the kind that are like a 
&gt; torsion spring instead of just C shaped) and am going to wire them in 
&gt; place when I put it back together.

good.  The wire can go in the notch around the bearing.

BTW, if the bearing has been sitting loose on the shaft, it would be a
good idea to replace it.  They seem to get beat up and you probably don't
want to remove the engine again!

I also safety-wire the snap ring that goes around the throwout fork shaft.
If the snap ring comes out of its groove it can bend the fork another
removal hassle.
