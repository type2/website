&gt; i sent an e-mail earlier enquiring about buying a '65 splitty in blue and
&gt; white. any response to that would be greatly appreciated. (see 'i need
&gt; help')

impatience wont help much simon. ;)

do you really want to spend that much --  you can have my split in blue and
white if you like--- how'd you like it - stripes, zig zags?   - cool - i'll
buy three!

if you are spending serious money (unadvisable first timearound) you could
get it inspected..  but they just rip old dears like our splits apart - with
statements like - servo isn't working/ power steering insufficient /
demisters unoperable etc etc..

best to join clubs/take someone experienced with you to view --  if you
don't know what you are looking at you can be set to lose big spending like
that.  whatever you buy will still need work.
&gt;
&gt; also if i were to lower the suspension on a '65 splitty and wanted to
resell
&gt; it would i lose resale value
&gt;
yes!
simple as that. (imho)
