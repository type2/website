Subject: Re: [VB] Difference in Engine Lid Lock 66/67


From: &lt;Claralw_at_aol_dot_com&gt;


&gt; there is a dif engine lid latch for 66 than 67.  I thought it had to do with
&gt; having 2 vs three screws, but Im not sure.  some 67 freak should know?.  the
&gt; apron is the same, though, so there is a slight change in the lid between
&gt; 66/67.

I have a 66 and a 67. My 67 lid was bent beyond repair so I put an extra 66 lid
on it. I used the 67 lock, it works fine. The only difference I noticed between
the 2 years was the license light. 66 has the bulb socket attached to the lens.
67 had a separate lens and the socket mounted in the lid about 4&quot; away. Both
67's I have/had were like this.
