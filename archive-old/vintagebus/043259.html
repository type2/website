&gt; The inexpensive electric fuel pump sold by most FLAPS [Walbro &amp; several

&gt; and sort of round on the bottom, is _very_ susceptible to heat whether that
&gt; heat is generated internally or externally.  For this reason it's operation
&gt; is erratic and unreliable when mounted in the engine compartment of an
&gt; air-cooled VW.

I've been running those FACET branded small square (2 x 2 x 2
inch) electronic fuel pumps for years on both buses with no problems ever.
I mount them on the left engine compartment's vertical strut that rises
from the left wheel well. I cut a 3/4 hole in the left side firewall, run
a 1/2&quot; neoprene tube directly from the fuel tank thru it over to the pump,
then the smaller VW fuel line to the carberator. The pump is wired to the
ignition ON wiring. I grommet that 3/4 hole with a short length of split
VW fuel line. 

Been doing this for years. Solves the problem of tying off the fuel line
when removing the engine too. Just disconnect the line from the carb and
youre engine is free.
