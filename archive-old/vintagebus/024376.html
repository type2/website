&gt; Needed two tires for my '63 crew, the front were not LT and tread was

 I just plunked down $400 for tires yesterday. 
I had 4 very nice 15&quot; rims that I was hankering to run on the upcoming
Mexico trip, but I insisted on 205 or smaller and at least 6 ply sides. 
I found just such a tire on the net, infact, someone pointed it out to
me, a Nankang 205/75R15. I emailed back and forth with Nangkang to make
sure it was what I wanted, and when I asked for a price, they referred
me to Beggs Tire, local shop, who I had already talked to about my
needs, but who had not been able to help.
So I call Beggs and tell them about the Nangking tire. Sure they got em,
but they are a trailer tire. Trailer tire? I cant use that! Can I? Not
specified for anything other than a trailer. Whats different?  Cant say,
says the tire guy. Sheet! 
So I ask again what is available in a 15&quot; rim, 6- or 8-ply, at least 25&quot;
total height, preferably 25.5 to 25.75&quot;. Sure he says, Cooper makes
that. I'll oredr them up. Ok, says I, I'll take 5. ( I want to be able
to destroy a tire in Mexico and still have a set, as well as a
mismatched spare) So I show up, and the damn things are way too tall,
Like 27&quot; plus, and have a really really agressive tread. 
Tire guy was really nice, we talk about what I am looking for and my
options. 

I want: a tall tire, about 25.5 inches for teh final drive artio. I want
very firm sidewalls to avoid the tire wag. My thoughts were that a 15'
would be easier for this since that extra inch of wheel makes 1 inch
less rubber for the same overall height, which means less sidewall to
stiffen.
Well, says Mr tire guy, I have a really nice 14&quot; tire that is C load
range, 6-ply, but is stronger in poundage rating than a smaller 8-ply.
Hmmm says I, thinking I can maybe keep the decent 14&quot; rims I am
running... 
The tires are &quot;trailbusters&quot; ( made by Cooper?) and they are 25.6 total
height. They are 27x850, 6-ply, C load, 1900lb rated and have a decent
tread, fairly agressive, but not to loud for good highway running. I ran
them at 40lbs, but they can be pumped to 50 for really heavy loads, or
35 for empty running. 5 of them mounted and balanced ( and they put the
decent passengers I was running on my wife's chrysler for free and threw
out her baldies) for $405.

I took them out and ran them hard today and there is definitely a better
feel on corners. 

I guess I'll have to wait for the 67 westy's resto to try out my
beautiful 15&quot; rims....unless someone needs a nice set of straight newly
painted 15&quot; wheels.... dated 9/59....
