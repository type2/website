Subject: field bus revives

day 1
drag bus out of field.  po informs that the tranny is seized up, then that he drove it to where it was parked in 77?  78?
 
day2 
jack back of bus up, put in various gears, spin one rear wheel.   center shaft spins.   funny noises in first gear, like it's not all the way in.   shift coupler is trashed.  drain tranny oil, looks okay.  put 30wt in tranny/ rgbs.  
 
day 3
install rear shift coupler, find broken front shift plate.   replace front shift plate, install motor.  find a key to left of motor in dirt and spare bolts... it operates ignition and some (all?) doors.   bonus.  install new 6V battery, post breaks off.  install battery out of rental bus. engine starts with key, drive up down street.   all 4 forward gears fine, reverse funky / grinds/ :(   evidently that's what a seized up tranny means.   hmmmmm
 Drive to car wash and pull out interior (front seat), get $10 of quarters, wash bus inside and out.   get filthy, bus still looks dirty, leave big pile of crap that blew off the bus at car wash.   drive back, remove engine, replace drivers windsheild because of the bullet holes.
