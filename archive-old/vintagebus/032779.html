Subject: Re:  Things I need for my 66 bus.

Well I've been working on the engine for my 66 bus and thanks to all the
replies to my previous post, I've got it clearer in mind what I need to do
to get the engine going again.

I called up the guru tonight and poised some questions to him.  I told him
that I'll be running dual 40IDF's with ratio rockers and a full flow
exhaust.  He then said, &quot;Man you don't wanna run 6 volts with a performance
engine do you?&quot;  It kind of startled me to hear him say this so then all....

well, I think it is the contrast of fat motor stuff with 6V, as most buses 
are 12V.   However, whether it is 6 or 12  is completely  irrelevant to power 
to the motor.   really.    So that comment was an attitude thing, not a 
practical thing.   The dual battery system in relay  isn't something I've 
done but it sounds more tricky that just one battery.
;;;;;;;;;;;;

It seems that in the past, no matter what I decide to do concerning any
project, I've always got a handful of people asking me why I don't do this
and don't do that or why in the hell I did this.

yup.   that's about right.  If I had a dollar for every time someone aked why 
I haven't painted the front bumper on my westy I could have paid someone to 
proffessional make it perfect and powder coat it.
;;;;;;;;;;;

with the extra torque that my 1600DP will have when coupled to a 3.88 trans,
I better have a good clutch in it.  The old 6v flywheels had a 180mm clutch
and I think it'd be best if I had a 200mm clutch installed.  I've heard/read
someplace that for about 6 months, VW had produced a 200mm 6v flywheel.  I
need one so where do I get one?  Can anyone help me here?

well, the tranny won't make more torque, but whatever,  the bigger clutch is 
clutchier.  Yes there is a 200mm 6V FW, just gotta find one.     Or you can 
use a 200mm 12V FW with a 12V starter and 6V solinoid.

Ps   I got me a 59 truck last summer, and promptly converted it to 6V.    
When someone saw it was 6V and told me I could make it 12V (duh), I give em a 
big smile and tell them I converted back to 6V.    :)
