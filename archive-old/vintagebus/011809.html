 Lyle gave credit where credit was *NOT* due. Thanks, but what I have is a
barndoor Ambulance which has been camperized. Definitely not a Westfalia.
The layout is similar but more closely resembles one of Mike Brady's house
designs. Definte &quot;Brady Bunch&quot; interior. I mean come on, a poptop Barndoor!
&lt;eep!&gt; now THAT's whacked! =) The Vintage Nazis would not approve, we know
it's not &quot;correct&quot; and won't ever be. Oh well, we like it for what it is.~
as it is...
(16&quot; spare mounted slightly off center on the windowless rear hatch and all!)
Thanks anyhow Lyle =)
