&gt;remotely be a problem would be if you ran your CR so high that the older 6V
&gt;starter would have a difficult time turning over the engine.  I saw nothing
in
&gt;your post that mentioned drag racing CR.


Nope, it's just a stock 1600DP so I think I'll be set.  Thanks for
mentioning it though - it would make a difference if I was running a higher
CR.
