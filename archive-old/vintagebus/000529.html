Subject: [VB] Midwest Swap meet &amp; Bus gathering / mini-campout
Message-ID: &lt;0.aa06002f.254c5228_at_aol_dot_com&gt;

MoKan Volkswagen club will be holding a swapmeet on Sunday November 7th at 
Proctor Elementary in Independence, Missouri (Just east of Kansas City)  
Starts at 7:30am and ends around 3:00pm  Call Dan at 816-254-3255 or 
816-796-6800 for details and directions.

KC Kombi's chapter of Neato will hold a Type 2 gathering and mini campout the 
night before - 4 doors away from the swap site.  The gathering will start at 
6pm but some will be there earlier, some later so just hop in you bus and get 
there.  There will be a simulated river crossing (Busses crowding on to a 
ferry) in the driveway and reenactment of the VW / Time Life ad with a bus in 
front of every house on the block...and LOTS of bus talk.  Once again, 
contact Dan for information.
