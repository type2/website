Subject: baywindow tank progress / Q's

Hey everyone,

A quick update on how my bay window fuel tank swap is going.  I have seen 
lots of posts on doing this, so i decided to give it a try.  I would be 
willing to write up a procedure as I do it, if anyone would be interested, 
pmail me and I'll see if there is an interest.

Went to the pick a part, and found a pre-71 bus, once I pulled off the panel 
that hides the fuel tank, i was surprised to see what great condition the 
tank was in.  Putting the tank in a compartment separate from the engine 
seems like it was a good idea.  I got the tank, sender, filler neck, 
ventiliation tubing (see below) and the hold-down steel strips for $45.  I 
was satisfied.  Cleaned out the tank, its drying now, and I will seal it 
with POR-15 tank sealer next time.  I cut the filler neck off of my old fuel 
tank, I will hose clamp it onto a section of rubber tubing (fuel grade, of 
course) a la No Quarter.  That seems to me to be the best way of doing it, 
especially since that's how the baywindow tank was set up in the first 
place.

Finally, my question.  The baywindow tank has a vent on the top that conects 
to some tubing that vents into the filler area.  I'm assuming that is for 
ventilation / pressure relief.  I believe that the VW engineers were pretty 
smart guys, so just plugging the hole probably isn't the smartest thing.  I 
am thinking about welding the vent tubing to the overfill metal tubing in 
the filler area of my splittie.  Other ideas?  It would be easier to close 
the hole, is this a bad idea?

Next question.  I measured the wraparound distance of the two tanks (the 
distance the steel holder oner straps will have to be to bolt the tank in) 
and I got a difference of 4.5 inches.  Meaning that I will have to cut and 
weld an additional 4.5 inches of steel strap into my existing straps to make 
them long enough.  Does this measurement sound right to anyone else that has 
done this?

Thanks!
