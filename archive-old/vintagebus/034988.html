&lt;&lt;  He has sent me many
 pics, and it is a beaute! One clue is the sticker in the rear hatch
 window for what I presume is a bus club: North Shore Bulli Boys. Is this
 a hawaiian club?  &gt;&gt;

North Shore Bulli Boys is a chapter of NEATO in western Canada. Actually they
are in British Columbia. You can contact Barry Guscott at 604-734-7383.
