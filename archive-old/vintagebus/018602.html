I think they all come from the same place.  I have a set of the repros,
and a set of the modification piece that Kelly (aka metwiz) makes to
convert them to &quot;tall&quot; doglegs.  I got mine at a swap meet; I think all
of the mail order places carry them.

On the repro set I have, to make them work, I'd have to break the spot welds
on the back side, the ones that hold the lower channel to the back of
the &quot;face&quot; and re-weld it farther down so the top would be properly squared.
