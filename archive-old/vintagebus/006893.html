In all reality if my memory serves me right it was #!$% MAD MAN MUNTZ. I'm
almost positive he was the pioneer of the four track decks, I remember going
to his store over 31 years ago to pick up my new 4 track deck after I kept
scratching the 45 records on my under dash record player, I think his
downfall was the big screen TV, this MAD MAN was way ahead of the times. I'm
not a good web search guy but MUNTZ logo was as memorable as Felix the Kat
or was that Fritz the Cat, oh my poor memory!

&gt; &gt; That was Marantz,(the crazy).  Craig made a 4 track player that mounted
&gt; &gt; below the dash about the same time.  Each tape held a album, 8 to 10
tunes,
&gt; 
&gt; I remember my first car deck back in the land of 1969 was a Lear, or
&gt; Learjet 4+4.  It played 8tracks or 4 tracks.  When a 4 track was inserted
&gt; the pinch roller would pop up into place, with 8 track it didn't.  

Now we're getting closer to the origin.  As I recall, Bill Lear was the
inventor of the 4 (8?) track tape, as well as other trivia such as the
business jet.
