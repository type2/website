Subject: Thermodynamics

Given the air cooled design, which I am told runs at a head temp of around
650F - what keeps this from running down a hot dry road and suddenly up
ahead it has been raining for awhile and you encounter large puddles. How
does this extremely hot motor cope with copious amounts of cold water
without cracking the block? Or it already common knowledge this is bad?

Deep thoughts for the eve,

jt
