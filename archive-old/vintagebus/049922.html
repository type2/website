&gt; &gt; Do We need a special adapter for where the nose cone mounts when switching

&gt;
&gt; ... If your bus original came with a split case tranny (ch # 469 xxx and
&gt;earlier) you need a mount that adapts the nose cone to the bus.   If you
&gt;have a bus that came with a tunnel case you don't the nose cone is the
&gt;same.
&gt;  The RGBoxes bolt on just the same bignut or little nut.
&gt;
&gt;  do realise that if youstill keep the 63 and earlier suspension you will
&gt;change the front to rear brake ratio, as the big nuts have bigger brakes
&gt;than the samll nuts.   This can cause problems in emergency braking
&gt;situations.    Though the big nuts do help with achieving freeway speeds.
&gt;
&gt;  So Do consider doing the front suspension swap if you do the rear.
&gt;Also, brake cylinders are cheaper for the 64-67 front  than the63 and
&gt;earlier.
&gt;
&gt;  earlier front beams do not have the handy dandy lip on the axle nut dust
&gt;cover like the late ones do, in case you are not sure which kind you have.

The early buses are rated as 3/4 ton vehicles, the later ones ('63 up) are
one ton.  The later ones have larger torsion bars as well as brakes, and
perhaps the wheel bearings are larger also?

One modification I did on a '62 I once owned was to mount the front
anti-roll bar off of a '67.  It all fits w/ the '67 mounting hardware.
