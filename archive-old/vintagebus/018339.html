VanBondo sez,
What? No, just a basic errand boy for the bigger boys.
I suppose he drives a &quot;Vee-Dubya.&quot;
His smarter brother and covert, (the real slim shady)
Dad got him the job at Greyhound. Thin resume and
clueless as hell but he's got a mean streak and is
apparently in charge of the loading dock. Keep an open
eye on the increase of import business and oil spills
around the dock... Does Greyhound still ship weapons
to distant locations? Travel tickets on the busline
are apt to universally go up real soon.
