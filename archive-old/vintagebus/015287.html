Subject: carb vs timing?
Date: Mon, 21 Feb 2000 13:30:43 -0700
Sender: dworkin_at_village_dot_org


I just swapped out the carb on the '60 with a new one 
(freshly rebuilt with new bushings, etc).  Now, I'm having ignition
problems that are very reminiscent of the timing being off.  These
problems did not occur with the previous carb.

The question is: can sufficient mal-adjustment of the carb cause
timing-like symptoms, or have I just managed one of those coincidence
things?

Thanks.
