Hi all,

After noticing a growl getting louder from the final drive of my '65, I
decided to bite the bullet and drain the tranny and redux boxes. The tranny
was OK (just the normal metallic mud from 4 years of use) so I refilled it,
but sadly there were some sizable chunks of metal from the right side redux
box.

good thing to do- change the tranny oil.  I recommend it every year or 10K 
miles, for tranny longetivity.   I use the slick 50 oil-   which seems to 
make it quieter so i figure its a better lube.

Weird thing is, when I drained the redux box it wouldn't stop draining! It
seems like it's draining oil from the tranny, down the axle tube and into
the redux box. Anyway, I plugged the redux box and attempted to fill it -
which took forever! It was like the oil wouldn't pass the gears or it was
draining from the redux box, back down the tube to the tranny. I hadn't
overfilled the tranny, but after it was all together again a checked the
tranny level and it needed an extra litre!!! Had none of these problems with
the other redux box.

well, that is exactly what it does- they are connected.  

 perhaps there was a slight slope and the uphill side didn't do what the 
downhill side did.   I drain the center section first, then plug it, drain 
one side, plug it, fill it , drain other side, plug it, fill it, and last 
fill the center for that reason.  

so it does not make sense to change just the center section- all should be 
done at the same time.  Or it is like draining part of the oil ot of your 
motor, and topping it off.
...................

What stops tranny oil flowing down the axle tube to the redux box? Is there
a seal in the tranny/tubes to stop oil going down the axle tubes? I mean, I
should be able to drain the redux boxes without topping up the tranny,
shouldn't I ?

no- the tubes enclose the axles and oil can flow through the tubes.     For 
the same reason, it is best to change the tranny boots when the oil is 
drained, so you dont have a mess when you pull off the old boots.

so, when you have the rear wheel off the ground, wiggle the shaft the big nut 
goes onto.  There shouldn't be any noticable play.   If there is you have bad 
bearings, and it will only get worse.   I know a woman who had loud growly 
noises from the back of her 66, and kept driving.  3 weeks later she was 
going up  a hill in seattle and the bus wouldn't go anymore.  the engine ran, 
but the bus didn't go anywhere.  Turned out the bearings got so bad on one 
side that a gear chewed a hole in the RGBox housing, and all the oil went out 
everywhere, inside was a mess of shavings and about a cup of oil.    And the 
axle shaft actually snapped, guess from heat stress.   I kept part of it.  
Wish I'd have kept the chewed RGbox housing.   So the moral is fix it before 
it gets bad, or it is a lot more hassle.  

Which is why I took the 61 off the road, as I was getting metal shavings in 
one RGBox after one year (which was  about 3K miles for the summer driver), 
and decided to get it sorted out before it chewed mass shavings into the 
tranny and damaged it.  among other things needing fixing.
