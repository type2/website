&gt; Tell you what.  All I have been doing is relaying info about AridZona Bus

sellers

Volks,
	Let's not let this get out of hand. I believe that dan (who
questioned 
the post from UJ) was simply questioning if such posts fell under the 
ebay clause, and will vouch for dan being an upright guy (although 
technically I think his bus is a pancake engine ;) UJ is a total gem to 
the VW community and I suspect that dan meant no disrespect. I will say 
in his defense that the past several posts from UJ have not contained 
descriptions nor any indications of what the link went to. So that the 
list member &quot;has&quot; to check out the link just to find out what UJ posted 
about. I for one usually just delete the post if it has no description 
of what it is, however I can say a description would make me more prone 
to checking it out. Either way, to be honest I feel UJ should get a bit 
of leeway on the list for the simple fact he is such a large part of the 
VW community in the western US. Well enough of my blabbering.
