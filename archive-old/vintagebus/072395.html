Subject: Re: [VB] Hippie Bashing

and a pot leaf hat by Calvin Kline. Oh, you can get pretty well done up
in the latest Punk Rock fashions too only a few racks over!

Whatever it takes to become a hippie ...............
I must have gotten it worked out pretty good, my neighbors normally only
stay a year or two and they're off the get one of those big houses with
Brick on the front with vinyl siding on the sides and back.
Great life driving an hour to work, it justifies any amount you want to
spend on any car.
Wonder which State claims the most HumVee owners?
Texas claims the most GM Suburbans. Strange name for a car.
