&lt;&lt; Save some time by getting a turkey baster (big syringe like tube with

Or you could get a nasal syringe (I think it's called) from the drug store - 
it's a rubber bulb thingy with a long end to suck out fluid.  You might have 
to lengthen the end w/ vacuum or fuel hose.  Much less unwieldy than the 
large turkey baster.
