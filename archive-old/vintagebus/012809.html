ah exuse me were did we last leave our hero? in a sanantonio hospital
yah?
and how did he get there? why he drove there with no clutch.
 on acount of the fact that he smoshed in the front of his poor kombi.
 said clutch was inoperable even though the cable was fine.
our hero drove from 70 mi. outside of san antonio TX to tucson AZ
with no clutch. but that's another story for another installment.

smarty pants aloha

our zero er hero
