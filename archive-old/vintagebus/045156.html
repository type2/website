Subject: Ride needed to Puyallup from Eugene, OR
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

Hey there list,
I'm a new student _at_ the U of O in Eugene and really want to make it to the 
Puyallup, Wa show next weekend. My bus is in IL and this would be my first 
PNW meet. I'm looking for a ride from Eugene, OR to the show and would 
happily pay for gas round trip. If anyone has any other ways of possibly 
getting there, suggestions are welcome. I really want to meet some people 
I've been looking forward to meet up there and am excited. Does the Greyhound 
run there? Amtrak?
I'd love more info as to dates and times (I know I've gotten it before, but I 
seemed to have lost it).

FWIW, I'm 18 yrs old, a real nice guy and really into VW's. I wouldn't be 
sketchy to give a ride to as I'm courteous and respectful:) Too bad my '59 is 
2500 miles away...

Thanks for all the help,
Pete, new location the beautiful PNW...
