Subject: FS '66 Westy project
Mime-Version: 1.0

Last night I got a call and went &amp; looked at a 1966 bench seat pop-top 
Westy *project*.

The kid that has it for sale moved out of his parent's house and now 
they say he has to get it out of their garage.  

The body is in reasonably straight shape and some repairs have been 
started.  The nose appears to have bondo in the nose at the tip of the V.
The cargo doors are dented &amp; need to be replaced.  Very minor dents and 
dings in other spots.

The cargo floor at the cargo doors has been replaced, as well as both 
inner &amp; outer rockers under the cargo doors.  I guess they thought they 
needed even more support here, because they welded in a bed rail or angle 
iron there too.  The front floor corners have been replaced also.

I can't really comment on the quality of the work done, because the garage 
was poorly lit and there was stuff packed all around it where I couldn't 
make a fair judgement.  Looked &quot;ok&quot;.

He says it is complete, but I did not see the icebox.  I didn't see the 
fiberglass pop-top either, but he says he knows he has it somewhere.  The 
bumpers are the earlier &quot;slash&quot; style.  I did not unpack the bus to check 
the condition of everything.

In a nutshell, this would be a good *project* bus for someone who knows 
what the hell they are doing (it is completely taken apart, including 
steering box &amp; pedal assemblies), just plan on spending several months 
putting it back together.

The price is right for what it is at $500, and it is in the Vinings/Smyrna 
area in Georgia.  It would have to be trailered.  His parents want it gone 
in 2 weeks.  Serious inquiries can be emailed to me &amp; I will put you in 
touch with the owner.

Dave
