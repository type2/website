How about a big fat relay,70A?We do this on the second battery on the
vehicles that are running Data acquisition systems,or a master cutoff switch
mounted through the bulkhead either engine compartment or rear seat area.How
about a nice high pressure ball valve on the rear brake line to hold
pressure to the rear brakes when parked,we did the opposite of this to fail
individual corners during brake testing.You could also do a fuel cutoff
solenoid like was used for SW gas heaters,might get them a few blocks before
stalling and most likely abandoning the vehicle.

Just use common sense and an understanding of what you are doing before
attempting anything like this.


In my area I don't worry about theft just the cops declaring it an abandoned
vehicle and towing it even though it is current and registered to the house
across the street and parked legally.

&gt;&gt; If you're really sure that the far right fuse is good, look at the top

&gt;
&gt;Speaking of that big fat red wire, recently I've had my front kick panels
&gt;off (fancy simulated wood grain paneling) and have temporarily been taking
&gt;that wire off of the fuse block as an paranoid anti theft measure.  I plan
&gt;to install a kill switch.  should I wire it to that main hot, 

No.  That wire has a fair amount of juice going through it and it would
take a rather beefy switch.  I'd figure it could have up to 75% or so
