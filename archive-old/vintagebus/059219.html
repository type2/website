Subject: Re: [VB] Turn signal switch 6/8 wire

&gt;From: &quot;Hulme, Charles&quot; &lt;cahulme_at_nps.navy_dot_mil&gt;

&gt;
&gt;What's the difference between the 6 wire and 8 wire turn signal switch?

Two more wires.  Hope this helps!

Seriously, the two extra wires are probably for the headlight dimmer,
especially if they are brown.  One was originally grounded and the
other one went to the dimmer relay, which replaced the floor-stomp
dimmer switch.  These two wires are connected when you pull the turn
signal switch lever towards you.  Otherwise, the 8-wire switch should
work the same as the 6-wire switch.
 
&gt;Also its in pretty bad shape, is it conceivable to take it apart and
&gt;re-solder(sp) disconnected wires inside the switch?

Probably, if you are slow and careful.  Use rosin-core solder; acid-core
solder (as used for plumbing) will eat up the connections.  Also try
some contact cleaner (_not_ WD40) in the switch; electronics stores
sell this as &quot;TV tuner cleaner&quot; or &quot;switch cleaner&quot;.

Good luck!
