Subject: RE: [VB] spring plate bolts

this is challenging, take your time. we just did a tranny swap this spring. 
all the bolts will need to be loose when trying to get them all started. you 
just have to wiggle and fight with the axle while starting the last one or 
two. be careful not to strip them. they also should be tightened in a 
certain order per the Bently.

&gt;
&gt;Just replaced trannie, bolted spring plates up, all but two bolts will
&gt;not line up. Is there a trick to get all bolts started?
&gt;Thanks
