Subject: VintageBus Auction: proxy?
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

Thom, list

So how is proxy bidding working on VB Auction?  Are all bids still sealed 
until the end?  What are the increments that a winning bid will pay over the 
next highest bid?  You know something like this, right?:

$0-5 = $.25
$5-25 = $.50
$25-100 = $1
$100-1000 = $10
$1000 up = $25

I think the proxy is the way to go too, so the winning bidder does not &quot;leave 
a lot of money on the table&quot; as we say in the construction industry.  When 
bids on a building project come in, say $5,000,000, 4,900,000, 4,950,000 and 
$3,900,000 the low bidder is said to have left a million on the table.  Of 
course high bids win in auctions, not low bids, but you get the idea.  The 
construction industry would love it if they had sealed proxy bidding.  Humm, 
maybe that's an idea to attract bidders in tight times.  The owners would 
hate it.

PS.  Just in case someone is keeping a count, I am completely with Thom on 
the New Bus thing, VW is raping the vintage enthusiasts with lawyers and no 
service or parts support and then using the nostalgia of the vintage to drum 
up more sales.  Beyond Thom, I would not like the &quot;New Bus&quot;, no matter what 
it looked like or how much it cost.  As long as it was manufactured by the 
modern day Nazis that run Volkswagen, a slime ball company imHo, I would not 
want one.  Okay if it was hydrogen fuel cell powered or ZEV I would maybe 
think about it, but then where would I fill it up?  After brain dead takes 
over, we are going to make LOTS of progress on that front!  Flame offlist 
please.  Okay now that I have cooled down, I retract the &quot;Nazi&quot; thing, please 
replace with &quot;Ahole Jerk Bastards&quot; (that's right their mother's were not 
married).  They are not killing us with gas, just raping us for a quick 
thrill.  Yes you can consider me a closed-minded bigot who owns no &quot;modern&quot; 
vehicles.
