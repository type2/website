&gt;Then we talked about an AIRS decal for
&gt;members to put on there buses, I think that this
&gt;decal would cause people who don't know what Airs is
&gt;to ask

I think this is a good idea, just let us know when
they  are available!
The AIRS site does include info such as if you have
camping/parking/sleeping space available, and for how
long, but maybe this, along with a person's
willingness to hav VW owners stop just to visit, could
be emphasized, if necessary.

of room for bus owners to camp for an evening)
