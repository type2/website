You asked about do-it-yourself camper modifications.  I recently had the joy 
of traveling from Florida to Kentucky in a modified Riviera Bus.  The 
interior had been gutted by a previous owner leaving only the Cabinet/stove 
combo sitting directly behind the drivers seat.  The man I bought it from 
simply built a platform out of plywood that extended from the rear decklid 
over the deck until it lined up in the cargo area with the sliding door 
opening.  The edge was flush with the sliding door when it was fully 
retracted.  He then built a brace and a kickplate at the front effectively 
creating a box that served the same purpose as the Westy pull out bed but in 
permanent pull out mode and much sturdier.  He covered this box in carpet and 
threw a thin but comfy futon over top of it.  He now had a bed that could 
double as a second tier cargo area when camping was not in the plans.  He 
also cut into the platform about two feet from the front and put in hinges 
creating a lid se he could access the area underneath the box (where the 
bench would have been) for storage.  On my trip I stored all my clothes and 
gear inside the box and slept on top of it each night.  I'd send you a 
picture but I left the bus in Kentucky with a friend.  
Also since the box practically held itself in place due to the size and 
weight it could be easily removed if the owner were to come across an 
&quot;original&quot; set to reinstall.  No damage to the interior.  

Hope this helps or gives you ideas.
