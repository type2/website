Subject: [VB] I need some wiper arms (NOT BLADES) for my 66 bus.

Does anyone have a set of wiper arms for my bus?  The one arm that I did
have was not an original but I'd really like a matching set.  They don't
have to be original - just functional.  I can take care of getting the
blades myself.  Thanks for the help...
