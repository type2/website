&lt;&lt; Can someone tell me what the correct decklid would be on a 57 single cab?
 I've seen them in photos with and without the 3rd brakelight.  Which one is
 correct?
  &gt;&gt;
depends on when your bus was made.

the center brake light (only, not third) was dropped in favor of two brake 
lights as of  5th april 1957 at chassis number 246 964.   The deck lid used 
for about 100 000 more buses was flat above the liscense plate area, not 
humped like the 59 and later ones.
