?!?!?!?!?

I .think. the 25/36 engins had smaller cranks, but the 1200/1500/1600's
are similar.  There is a difference w/ that crazy o-ring that i never
fgiured out, but..

i've done quite a few 6v&lt;&gt;12v flywheel swaps.  From 40h up.

Right now i have a mexi-case-once-all new (70ish thousand miles
ago..built for a 69 that was all 12v..) 1600sp with a 200mm 6v flywheel.

i think you missed something this time steven.;)


later...david
