All that water is going to come out of the tray at the next turn anyway,
and it will end up in your lap *and* on the floor.

I understand about the floors - I'm thinking of applying the same treatment
to the low spots in the front floors, giving the water a path all the way 
out of the car.

&gt; Thom, I'd rather have water (or in my case, mud) in my dash tray than on the 
&gt; floor.  Dash trays screw in, and I have a bunch of them.  Floors require 
&gt; welding to replace the rusted holes!
