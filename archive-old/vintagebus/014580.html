Hi Jamie,
First off would be a through cleaning of the carberator.  Then see if the
engine works right.  If not it is probably the choke that is running the idle
when the engine is cold.  When the engine warms so does the electric choke
element in auto chokes from 1961 VWs on.  When the engine is warm the pilots
jet and air fuel mixture screw keep the engine idling.  So if all else fails
and the air fule mixture screw still does not keep the engine running then you
might need a bigger pilot jet.    Eric &amp; Barb
