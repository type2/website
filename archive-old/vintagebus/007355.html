Hi all
Something I have never seen on the list is a List Name Tag
I have seen ,,, see me at the Yellow bus at 10..  etc,, but what if the
Yellow Bus is forced to stay in the parking lot and the Listee walks right
by you,,, you'd never know..
So ,, My question, is there a  &quot;Hi , My Name is  Mr Bus Driver &quot;   tag
available?  :-)
or is there an artistic Listeee that could create a image that could be
printed out and pinned to our proud chests?
I was trying to design one that would slip into a clear plastic sleeve with
a pin .. the kind you get at trade shows etc,
