Subject: Wide 5 converter plates for late model discs

When I bought my current project bus the PO had already converted the rear to IRS and mounted later model discs and drums from Bay buses.
But along with the bus also came a whole stack of wide 5 rims that were originally on the bus.
I was a little sad that I couldn't use these due to the change in stud pattern and have thought for a while that perhaps adapters may be an answer to this.
However the obvious offset issues are there.
Will skinny rims fit easily on the front &amp; avoid rubbing on the guards?
Can I get a set of wide 5 rims widened for the back that compensate for the offset created by the adapters?
Is there another solution or for practical reasons am I just going to have to put up with the Bay 5 stud pattern &amp; the fact that far fewer wheels are made for that pattern?
I'd be thankful for any hints or opinions.
:o)
Cheers &amp; God Bless
