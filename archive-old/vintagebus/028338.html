Hello Stephen
I live in Greenville, have all my 36 years of life. Actually Steve White VW
has only been around for a few years at most, our long time ago VW dealer was
Leroy Cannon Motors, so no vintage dealer tag frames from Steve White VW!
However if any one has a dealer frame from Leroy Cannon, Greenville SC I would

love to buy it.

Meredith

&gt; license plate frame etc. from this dealer, i'd love to acquire one.
