Subject: Re: [VB] rear hatch removal

I ended up going to Sears and buying an impact driver to take the screws 
out. And I must say WOW!! It was so easy with this little tool, it even took 
out the ones I stripped. But I have a new question. Where can I get new 
screws? I have searched the local hardware stores and can not find a match 
in size and threads. Any online vendors sell these?
