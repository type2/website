Subject: Re: [VB] Repro taillights - update

What has worked for me with a frozen switch is WD-40.  Just spray it into
the switch (right around where the knob connects to the switch), grab the
knob (get an old knob that you're not going to use any more for this) with
some pliers and just start working the switch.  It worked for a frozen
headlight switch for me.  Good luck.

&gt; I'll see if I can just piece these together and then just go over the
wiper
&gt; switch... I don't want to brake it... I'll have to remove it somehow and
see
&gt; if I can loosen it up a bit.
