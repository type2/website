 It looked like it was pretty well made inside to my machinist eyes.
 
 I'll take this at face value and assume that you are a machinist, or have 
some experience. I understand almost all other aspects of engine building and 
running well enough for me, but this one still boggles me. Say that one crank 
throw was down .002, #2 maybe. What would have to be done to make it all 
right again? Also, If the places where the bearings go were worn, would it be 
possible to only use different size bearings and reduce the need to regrind 
the crank? Or is weight a major factor? Sorry if these questions are a little 
prying and not well worded, but I'm curious :) I was down at my local (only) 
VW store and asked about getting my crank reground and was quoted a price of 
67 dollars for shipping, etc and it could take two weeks
 to get back. I guess he does not have the ability to do it there, so he 
contracts it out to someone. All the other machine shops around here are only 
set up to do V8's, which I'm sure is a problem other places too. All of this 
piqued my curiosity and made me wonder if it wouldn't be profitable to be a 
machinist myself, but I gotta learn about it first. &gt;&gt;
Hi Brad,
Good question!  The Porche folks do this all the time.  Since thier cranks 
are not as abundant as ours ($$$) it is not a big deal to them to use two 
sets of main and/or rod bearings.  So that they could get away with only 
having one bearing journal turned down to the next .010&quot; and just have the 
rest fo the journals polished.  They seem to not have any problems with 
vibrations.  Since we are using stock VW cranks the idea of tieing up a 
hunderd or more dollars in main bearings is not really financially reasonable 
unless you are running a rare crankshaft.  Though running different sized rod 
bearings would probably be reasonable for even the most common crankshafts.  
For the $67.00 that your VW FLAPS has bid to do your crank is a very good 
price.  Just make sure to give you crank the ring test to make sure it is not 
cracked in the first place.  Then when you get it back all reground check to 
make sure that they radiused the corners where the bearing journals meet the 
webs.  Also a good idea to buy at least a 6&quot; dial caliper to check the crank 
before and after you get it.  After all you do not want to turn in a STD/STD 
crank and get back a .040&quot;/.040 ground crank, or even one that has been 
reground with tapers on all of the journals.  You never know what kind of 
night the machinist had before working on yours, and/or if the fellow is 
getting OJT on your crank.  Lastly it pays to check the crankshaft journals 
sizes and make sure the bearing you were supplied are correct for it!  BTDT 
and ended up building one of our first engines with .010&quot; too big of main 
bearings.  Gee honey we can not keep the oil pressure light out at idle!  The 
bearings came from a major manufacture in Germany and were plastic shrunk to 
the cardboard backing from the factory with the correct size marked on the 
cardboard!  Remember that even though folks can be professionals they are 
human and make mistakes.  Unfortunitly since producers of stock VW parts do 
not have the huge inspection system that VW had back in the 1950s-60s those 
mistakes fall right through the cracks and right into your life.  Eric&amp;Barb
PS.  Yes, I (Eric) trained as a machinist in the USAF at the Army Aberdeen 
P.G. in MD USA for 6 months.  Next based at Dyess AFB working mainly on C-130 
Hercules cargo aircraft and air field equipment for three years.  Plus three 
two month TDYs at Mildenhall AFB GB, where I was working on Lots of cargo and 
midair refuleing aircraft.  Plus was on duty to fabricate/repair parts for 
two SR-71 based there, and spent one long night on sudden 12 hour duty due to 
AF-1 being just almost a stones throw away from our WWI machineshop quansit 
hut.   Eric&amp;Barb
