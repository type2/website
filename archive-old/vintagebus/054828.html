Subject: RE: [VB] Another Engine Question


I have been told that the Mexican engines also use a different selection of 
parts for the Oil Pump, fuel pump etc..  True? False? Sometimes?

&gt;
&gt;In the 3 NEW VW Mexican engines I have disassembled there were NO gaskets
&gt;under the cylinders, maybe they forgot on these?  These had GREEN silicon
&gt;(or substance of some origin) under the cylinders.
&gt;

&gt;
&gt;ps. I have taken the heads off of 1 new VW Brazilian engine but failed to
&gt;look under the cylinders on it, but did notice that the heads on these are
&gt;cut like a type 4 (shallow) and will not work on any other VW engine and 
&gt;the
&gt;fins on the cylinders go almost to the top of the barrels, thus, no other 
&gt;VW
&gt;head will interchange on those!

&gt;I'm confused, if VW doesn't use paper gaskets anymore, then why are they
&gt;STILL under each and every cylinder that comes out of Argentina, Brazil, 
&gt;and
&gt;good ol' Mexico where all the models are still built. Even the commercial
&gt;aircooled VW engines still carry the paper gasket, it is still in the VW
&gt;service manuals, and every gasket kit from every country of manufacture
&gt;still includes them.
&gt;just a thought

&gt;
&gt;There is a service bulliton that states from VWoA to delete the paper
&gt;gaskets from under the cylinders. They say to use silicon VW part number
&gt;******** I will try to find it if I feel like going through all my books.

&gt;Gene Berg told me years ago (Gene did tell you!) that VW no longer used
&gt;the paper gaskets between the engine case and cylinders.  I don't use
&gt;them.  Gene is gone now but I am still afraid of going against his
&gt;&quot;suggestions&quot;.   Gary Gibson
