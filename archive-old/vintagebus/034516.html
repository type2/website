&lt;&lt;  install the generator but don't hook up the regulator yet.  Make sure the 
generator body is grounded, either by being mounted in securely or by running 
a
 temporary ground wire from the generator housing to battery negative.  &gt;&gt;

Hi Volks,
Also make sure to leave off the fan belt to allow the generator to spin like 
an electric motor while it is polarizing.   Eric&amp;Barb
