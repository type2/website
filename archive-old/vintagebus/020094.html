Unless you talk to every single buyer (and they are honest...how many of
us fudge on the price we pay for things??) how can you be sure of the number??? 

Just because something sold fast does not mean that it sold for (or even  
close to) the asking price. Especially for some of the extremely inflated asking prices that show up in the classifieds. How many &quot;REDUCED&quot; ads
do you see week after week on cars/busses that started out WAY high??? 

Sure lots of things sell, but I think many things have the appearance of
&quot;high&quot; price when behind the scenes, the really sell for much less (see ribbed rear bumper at OCTO fame). The &quot;oldbug_dot_com&quot; oval rag not withstanding. 

The site is fantastic though Everett...keep it up!!
