Subject: [VB] Bearing Measurement

&gt;Well, I'm going to be tearing apart my motor and will need to be
&gt;measuring the crank bores.  Any recommendations on a gauge to do this?
&gt;Type, manufacturer, place to buy (on-line maybe?).  Keep in mind I'm, as
&gt;Ronnie refers to me &quot;one of those cheep guys&quot; ;-).  But I guess I
&gt;shouldn't cheep out on this critical piece of test gear.  So any tips??

Harbor Freight has a cheap set of bore gauges (  $10 ).
These are Tee shaped tools of various sizes that telescope to
fit and by lightly locking , then &quot;rocking &quot; once through the hole, they hold
the size of the bore and can be read with a quality measuring device
for a very accurate measurenent. There you go.
Dave
