Subject: RE: [VB] RE: New bus book/not for the purest

  The book is published in England so I am sure that Dave from
Ceative-engineering (a real inovator) and Ricki James, the KING of lowered
Barndoors had a lot of input in the book

Cool...  Maybe cool.  Some of these &quot;hot rod&quot; books are more fluff and 
&quot;might could be done&quot; than actual good advice.  Or they show you how to half

do a project and still leave you stranded.

Not sure what the book will be like, but I have to have it anyway :)

Take Care,
Adrian &quot;bus down for electrical upgrades&quot; Pillow
