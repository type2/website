Subject: Re: Redux Boxes?

&gt;From: &quot;Andrew Strom&quot; &lt;the-andyman518_at_charter_dot_net&gt;

&gt;
&gt;Well, I was talking to Jake Raby at a show a few months ago, telling him
&gt;about putting a type 4 in my bus; and he said that I would need to do
&gt;something about the redux boxes because the gears aren't all that strong
&gt;and will shatter with all the torque that a type 4 engine has.

I don't know.  As has been said, you can get an idea of what's going on
by looking at the parts involved.  On many RGBs, you can see the gear
teeth when you take out the fill plug.  Also, on pages H-4 4 and H-4 11
of your Bentley, you can see a good exploded view of the RGBs.  At least
on page H-4 4, the OD of the driven gear shaft (what the brake drum
slides onto) is 30 mm, to calibrate your eye.  On page H-6 6, there is
a picture of the transmission gears, plus other pictures on the following
pages.  The sectioned view on H-1 3 is also good, but the transmission
and RGB pictures are at different scales (RGB about 4.7:1, transmission
about 3.5:1).

I _think_ the Safari/Thing/Type 181 used the same gears as on a late
split Bus, and the same 1600 DP as the Beetles of their years.  If so,
each RGB was handling about 23 hp SAE.  By comparison, the Type 4 1700s
from 1970-1973 made 34.5-42.5 hp SAE per side -- around 50% to 85% more
than the 181.  (Numbers from the '73 &quot;Without Guesswork&quot; manual at the
doc project.  Add about 3% to the 1700 figures for the 2000 figures.)

Again, I don't _know_, but I have a little trouble believing that VW put
in parts that were only running at 55% to 65% of their capacity.  On the
other hand, these did go on the Buses, which were always a higher cost
model.  Also, reports of RGB gear failure seem to be relatively rare on
the lists - it seems like the bearings go, or the shaft splines for the
brake drum get worn out - well before the gears go.
