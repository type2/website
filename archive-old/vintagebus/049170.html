List:

I'm about 98% sure that this bus belongs to (used to belong to?) Dana Nye from So. California.  He's the guy that bought my '65 Double Cab.  The colors of the bus are Titan Red/BG, correct, but he went with a clear coat so it might cause an odd color in photographing.  I believe he (this Bus) won best of show at the 2000 Kelly Park.

I have to agree with everyone else, it's a sweet bus but whoa!  Although, we should be rootin' this guy on.  If he gets his price think of what it does to the value of a few other nice buses.   Ahh, I gotta remember we're aren't in this for the money, we're in it because of the love affair.

I guess here goes another bus on the slow boat across the Pacific.

'59 Westfalia (no price is high enough)
