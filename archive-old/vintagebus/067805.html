Subject: Re: [VB] inside the aluminum case from hades

yeah, stan w said that as well... oddly, it turned ovah like buttah! 
i've got the mic specs around here - ok, my cam measured 0.984&quot;  and spec
is  .9837-.9842. so that should be ok. i have to fool around and see what
tools i can use to measure the case bore.
----------------- Clip ----------------------
If you had a problem with the cam gear alignment that caused a glitch I
tend to think that the thrust surfaces on the elephant bearing would show
some of the severe wear (no picture of that) so I figure it looked OK to
you. Is there any way possible that an oil slinger or other shim/spacer
was left off the crank or improperly assembled?
I would expect to see some minor appearance of wear on the thrust surface
of #1 main. More so on the interior than the flywheel side.
While evaluating this situation you might want to lay the cam in the well
lubed cam bearings and give it a spin sitting in each half of the case
with a dial gauge riding on each journal.
If you've got some used cam bearings laying around, bolt the cam up in
the case using the new bearings and then try the old bearings and see if
you get any resistance.
In my assumptions and opinions I assume that this about a 5000 mile or
less new engine.
