&lt;&lt; &gt; Lastly the TO (release) bearing now spins really easily.  As I remember,
 &gt; this is a sign of needed replacement.  True?

 Doesn't matter. You have the motor out, replace it. That is, of course,
 unless you plan to pull it out again soon.
  &gt;&gt;
well, they are supposed to spin freely.  if they don't it needs replacement.  
If you are worried, take it out, place it on a clean rag on the floor, step 
on it and do the twist.    If you feel it crunch and grind, toss it, if it 
twists smoothly, its a good one.  I just hate to spend that money when it 
isn't broke.  Cheap VW people.
