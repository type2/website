Subject: Re: [VB] 66-67 rear shift rod help!

According to the parts list,  the rear shift rod you want is 211 711 171B 
(from ch no 835 088)

this means it's the same from mid 61 model through 67.  If you get one from a 
junked bus, don't cut or thrash the front rod, those tend to go more often 
than the rear rod does.   Unfortunately you have to pull the tranny to pull the 
rear rod.   That is, unless you cut the nose off the bus.    

Where are you located?    I have an extra but they are pretty long, might be 
easier if there is one local to you

specific enough in my earlier plea for help.  The part that I need is 
the rear portion of the shift rod itself.  Mine somehow rotted in half.

Does anybody know if the 66-67 shift rod rear portion is unique, or 
will the rear portion from any old bus work?
