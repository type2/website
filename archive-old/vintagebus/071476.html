&gt; I think that her tranny needs the typical usual work, I don't think it's
&gt; necessarily a 'junk' tranny. The engine, however, apparently, needs a new
&gt; case, and prolly the whole nine and a half yards by the time she's
&gt; through.

Typical usual work to be performed at the current shop ? :)
Did you see the engine support brace welded to the frame 
to &quot;fix&quot; an &quot;oil leak&quot; ? This should destroy the transaxle soon.
The &quot;clunk&quot; previously attributed to broken &quot;motor mounts&quot;
could be high mileage axle shaft fulcrum plate wear,
if not broken transaxle mounting blocks.
The engine was &quot;rebuilt&quot; under &quot;warranty&quot; without disturbing 
a layer of primer dust from paint sanding two weeks prior.
It leaks the same, and evidently needs another &quot;rebuild&quot;.
It never got to the first 500-mile &quot;inspection&quot;.
The brakes were installed such that she could not move
the pedal an inch. This 67 bus also got a &quot;12-volt conversion&quot;.
The shop installed a fuel sender bur deferred the gauge wiring
to a &quot;professional &quot;. They don't do electrical work:).
There are so many bogus repairs in  this scam it is hard 
to keep up with the history. Remember the steering problem ?
Muffler installed through holes drilled in the bumper ?
