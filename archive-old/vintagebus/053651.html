&gt; &gt; Has anyone tried this?

&gt; Not that one yet, but I have tried the Hoover recommended TSP (tri
&gt; sodium phosphate) method.  If you do this it is best to do it outside on
&gt; the BBQ or gas fired burner.  Use REAL TSP not the &quot;substitute&quot; that the
&gt; big orange box likes to sell.  That stuff does not work at all.

The big orange box says &quot;TSP&quot; on it in big letters.  In tiny print it says
that it doesn't contain trisodiumphospate.  False advertising?

The real stuff comes in white bags hereabouts.  Usually placed right next
to the fake stuff, and about half the price.

George
