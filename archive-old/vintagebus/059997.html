Hi all,

There was a recent post referring to the &quot;Bastard&quot; 1200cc 40hp motors installed in Busses from
around May of 1959 for about a year or so.  They were supposedly recalled and replaced by your local
dealership with the newer version of the 1200cc engine.  My question is, does anyone out there have
in their literature collections any original VW literature, VW technical bulletins, or workshop
manual references about the &quot;recall&quot; program and the procedures a dealership would follow when a
customer came in with a &quot;Bastard&quot; motor for replacement.  I have a June 1959 Double Door Panel that
originally came with a Bastard&quot; motor that was long ago removed.  It now has a mid-July production
Factory rebuilt replacement motor in it (and it's doing just fine, thank you!).  I, as well as
several other late 1959/early 1960 Bus owners out there, would really enjoy the chance to have a
photocopy of any VW paperwork about the &quot;Bastard&quot; engine recall program for our information and our
files.  Can anyone out there help me (and others) out with the info?  I'm not having any luck
finding any of this info in my own literature collection.  Thanks in advance for any assistance!
