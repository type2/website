I've met Jeff in person......he's the guy who has the 59 westy stuff for sale.
He's a little bit out there......, think about it...how many people forget to 
set the parking brake and wreck their 50K mile 59 westy?
I'm not so suck I buy the idea of the stuff being sold for 20K.
I've tried to get some parts off him for the past two years....hes hot and 
cold when it comes to selling that stuff.
20 grand for a damaged set of cabinets and some bus accessories?
Too far fetched to believe.
Might as well drop my wanted list in here too.

&lt;&lt;   And we thought buses were expensive, how about just the parts off a Westy

for 20 g's. I don't know if any of you caught the ad on VW Planet, but a guy

in Washington was selling everything off of his wrecked Westy. I got hold of

his mother to try to buy some pieces for my Westy and she told me the story

of the bus. After numerous e-mails to her son to try to get the prices on a

few parts, I was informed that all the PARTS were sold to Japan for $20,000

dollars. This was not a whole bus but just the parts, interior, mint tent,

sh#t bucket, all original almost mint interior etc, So I guess all our

Westy's have just gone off the scale in the overseas market, (I didn't break

the Friday rule Thom).

   Being that I didn't get any of the parts I need, does anybody (I heard

you do RD) have a couple of clamshell interior light holders and 1 lens, and

I know this is a long shot a hatch top rod? I got the original table I

needed at OCTO where an almost complete Hatchtop Westy interior with tent

sold for $1300.00, just think if the PO had run into the same OVERSEAS

fellow, he would have easily got the original $3500.00 he was asking.


ronnie   az.   looking for a few pieces for my 1960 Westy.
