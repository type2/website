Subject: &quot;1500&quot; decklid
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

Hello list---
I just got a package of various parts I bought from a guy who was clearing 
some stuff out. There is a church - key decklid in the stash that has an 
emblem just above the license light area that says &quot;1500&quot;(but it's a 
different &quot;1500&quot; emblem than a bug--It's squarer  like the volkswagen emblen 
on the back of later year splits) ---it is an original paint decklid and the 
emblem even has those stock little O-rings on the inside. Is this a decklid 
an original for those 1500 optioned busses in the earlier 60's-(it is a 
church key lid?) It's interesting and I just wan't some info?
BTW, isn't it funny that after you search for a lid for months and spend more 
than you want to on one, another is practically given to you. I had the same 
thing happen on the NOS 58-61 taillights I bought a while back! 

thanx
