Subject: V-dubs on TV

    Last night I caught &quot;20th Century w/ Mike Wallace&quot; on the History
channel.  He was talking about &quot;Subcultures&quot; had old newsreel footage of
various groups and events.  He was talking about Hippies, Jesus Freaks,
and finally Cults.

    It was amazing to watch footage of Woodstock (I got within 11 miles
of the site before I got stopped by the NY State Police...  I was 14 at
the time &lt;&lt;G&gt;&gt;).
    Alot of the film was shot from traffic helicopters... MILES &amp; MILES
of V-dubs!

    Next they covered &quot;Holy Rollers&quot; &amp; &quot;Jesus Freaks&quot; quite a few roamed
the US in the '70s driving VWs...

    This segued into &quot;CULTS&quot;... Jim Jones (VW Busses at his compound in
Guyana) and David Koresh in Waco TX (poignant picture of the lone
Baywindow in front of the buildings as the FBI stormed the compound)

    Yet, in the hour or so that I watched not once did he mention the
multitude of Volkswagens...  Vows are everything from good
transportation to a &quot;Way of Life&quot;... maybe should have done Us (V-dub
folks) as another Subculture &lt;&lt;G&gt;&gt;, one that has tied most of the others
together and has evolved through the last 50 yrs...

        Sorry for being so philosophical this early &lt;&lt;G&gt;&gt;

driver/ good transportation status)
