Subject: Going to Jerome. Need a Ride?

Hi,

Anyone in the L.A. area and on out to Phoenix interested in going to the 
Jerome Jamboree and arriving in style in a 64 Double Door Camper? Pmail me. 
My wife is bugging out on me. Its a long drive, company would be nice. 
Starting in Torrance, CA my route will be the 91 to the 60 to the 10 and on 
out to Phoenix on 9/13. Meeting up with the caravan to Gold King Mine on 
9/14. That's the plan for now. May be meeting up with Jim Thompson in the 
Beaumont area.

Chris
