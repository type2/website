Actually, not to start a war but I rather enjoy those posts.   I hate 
sifting through e-bay cr$p and like it when others on the list find things 
of interest to the vintage bus group.   I would rather spend my time reading 
posts to the list than searching e-bay every day!

May I propose that these sort of messages stop unless it is your stuff for 
sale?  No one has complained here yet but we had this discussion on another 
list because people hated getting hosed on things they may have gotten for a 
fair price.
