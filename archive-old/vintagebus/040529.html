I had on eof the mechanics from the local VW shop come over and look and 
listen to my bus, and he said that the header bolt has either come loose or 
broke, probally the later. He said there is a chance that I might be able to 
simply re-torque it, but he thought that was improbable.
But thanks for all your help.

&gt;&lt;&lt; loose flywheel? &gt;&gt;
&gt;Hi Allbug,
&gt;That would be a possibility, but the engine would run (If it would run at
&gt;all!) for only minutes before destroying itself.
