Subject: re:rhino lining

I have just begun to do a little web research-it appears as though Rhino =
and
Line-X are both polyurethane...jason suggested epoxy-do you just mean a h=
eavy
epoxy paint?

the bsic difference i can see between line-x and rhino:
rhino is softer-this possibly allows for more flexibility upon impact, an=
d
supposedly more traction

line-x is harder or more brittle, it is applied at a much highter tempera=
ture
and pressure-this allows for a 3or 4 second set time, as opposed to rhino=

which could be closer to a minute. this shortened set time i think allows=
 for
a more uniform thickness, and less drip sags etc. Imagine your bed with i=
t's
high and low points...a longer set time will let the rhino stuf ooze down=
 to
the low points.

i am still reading more about it. Both places have forums where people ca=
n
write in questions-there are a few questions about comparability-that is =
where
i got this info.
