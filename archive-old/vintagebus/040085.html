This is not the engine you were asking about but I thought you guys might 
like to know.

My friend Jeff had his stock from factory 1600 single port go 200,000 miles 
in a 69 bus. No rebuild. Would have lasted longer if he knew how to drive a 
bus when he got it. Drove it like a bat out of heck. Way to fast on freeway. 
Most mileage by PO was from Issaquah to Cali, hence freeway miles.

Dylan rebuilt his own engine to a 1641 and got 300,000 with mostly in town 
miles.

Can be done.
Jason
