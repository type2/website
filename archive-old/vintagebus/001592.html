I was trying to think of videos I could rent that might have VW buses in
them, and I thought of that song &quot;Convoy&quot;. It has a line in it that goes
&quot;eleven long haired friends of Jesus in a chartreuse micro bus&quot;.  Has anyone
seen the movie?  Does it have a VW Transporter in it? Heh, and even more
important, when they &quot;wrecked the gates doing 98&quot;, did it keep up with the
convoy?

Thanks,

Kevin Sullivan
