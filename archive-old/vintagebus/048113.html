yes, I'm still tripping.

l seem to have also lost track of time.  Oh, well, these thingshappen.   Drove
down to Santa Cruz, California, from Oly the Tuesday after Vintage Meet.   (we
took Monday to do nothing,  I think, or try to do nothing. Had to unload a
bunch of stuff from my 61, and figure out what was going to California and
what wasn't.)

The plan ws for me to get the 59 my Dad found, make it run, and drive it back.

Anyway, the first day of the trip was uneventful.   I was so beat I kept
wanting to fall asleep.   Chris had slept all afternoon the day before , and
seemed in better shape than I was.   We drove through Wasj\hington, and all
the way through Oregon, over the Siskiyoos, and arrived in Redding where we
visited Steve of Wolfgang, International, who is a really nice guy.

The next day was the central Valley.  Booooooorrring.    And hot, of course,
but not as hot as it could be.    about 75-80.  

hm- to relieve some of the monotony, I decided to try an experiment and see
how hot the engine ran at different rpms.   This was in Chris' 65 which has a
big motor, and had a roof rack, and was still somewhat laden. The road was
flat.   We stayed at each speed long enough (at least minutes) to feel that
the engine temp had stabilized.   Temps of the engine oil will of course vary
from vehicle to vehicle, depending on what if anything is on the roof, hills,
or lack thereof, oil cooler type, etc.   Weather is a factor, not just
temperature, but humidity.   And other things.   I am saying this as a reason
why I hesitant to post these figures,as they do not reflect your vehicle in
specifics .   What I do believe to be applicable is the curve.   I talked
before about on the one hand, heat produced by the motor goes up with rpms.
And on the other hand cooling also goes up with rpms.  The gripping hand is
how these factors combine  

 SO...

What does that mean?   

as the rpms rise, heat produced and heat blown away does not happen at the
same rate.   


RPM        OIL TEMP
2200           210
2400           210
2600           205
2800           210
3000           215
3200           220
3400           225

I may have this slightly off, as I am reciting from memory but the gist is the
same.

Though amount of air being blown rises , at a certain point the heat produced
rises more.    It seemed that 2600 RPM was the optimum cooling engine speed.
The engine ran a bit hotter  at lesser rpms, and also ran hotter at higher
rpms.    Max torque is higher, about 2800 rpms.  

So, if you are runnning hot, don't back down to 2000 rpms, go to 2600.   

This could be more fully figured out, as there were other rpms we wanted to
explore, but it didn't happen this time.    If anyone else has a temp guage
and rev counter in bus, I'd be very happy to know what your's reports.

Stopped by my Dad's to look at the Truck,  Truck is a bit of work.   Ball
joint front suspension, large nut tunnel case tranny in back, dead 40hp motor
with half an inch of end play, the shifter set up is way funky, and the
electrics are pretty messed up.  But... It does have a pretty nice body, very
little rust, minor dings but no big dents, and even has the VW emblem on the
nose..... and then on to Santa Cruz.

The story of reviving Mr. Truck (buildt in Dec 58) comes in my next report.
