Subject: Re: [VB] How to date a front beam?

 I noticed my front beam on the '61 Double Cab is missing the steering 
 dampner. I also noticed that the beam has both mounts on it, while 
 the bus still has the mount on it to accomodate the proper year beam.
 
 So...what beam do I have? The drums look like a '66 beam I've got a 
 little. Is there a number or something so I can tell what it is? An 
 other way to know for sure?
 
 Is the steering dampner the same for all years? Is it the same as a bug one?

if the dust caps are hard to pry off (no lip) you have a 55-63 beam (little 
link pins).  If the dust caps have the convient pry off lip, you have a 64-67 
beam  (unless you have the 1 ton spindles, or a ball joint beam, but lets 
ignore that)

If I remember right, the early buses had one end attach the beam, one end the 
bus, while the later (64-67) buses  had both ends on the beam.   

the steering dampner 211 415 901 F is the same for early and late splitties.  
Even for barndoor if they have the extra option of a dampner installed.  (63 
ed parts list, early versions NLA).  Bugs ones are different.
