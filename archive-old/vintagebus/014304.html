I don't think it came across that way - I think people saw it as
&quot;I'm putting some stuff on ebay, so I can make a mint and retire early,
neener neener neener!&quot;

Maybe you should have written something like:

&quot;I have a standalone tent fs.  I'm trying to get $xxxx.  If I don't
get any good offers by xx/xx/xx then I'll put it on ebay.&quot;

I'll take those NOS RHD BD floors you have, befor eyou put them oneBay!

&gt; They can make their own decision but only if they have the info.
