Being we have been on the subject of fuel, how about
what Grade of gas do you use and what is your TRUE (a
lot of dreamers out there) gas mileage.
*************************************

I run a 1600DP with a 34PICT3 new Mexican engine (from
Ronnie, shameless plug) and check my mileage on a semi
regular basis. On a daily basis type of driving, I
average 19/20MPG and fully loaded with gear and family
with a full Westy rack I average 23/25MPG, wind be
willing. I have checked my mileage on a trip where
there was a strong tail wind and got as high as 28MPG.
I normally drive 'staying alive 55'
I burn regular grade gas. I have tried burning the
'better grade$$' and have not noticed any difference.
