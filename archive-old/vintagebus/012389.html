This is not about the front door panels, but the door panels that are for the
back area. (Not sure what you call those doors)
My existing door panels go from top to bottom of the door, with a hole cut out
for the window. As far as I know these are original panels.

I noticedon Thom's rebuild that his panels don't go all the way up.

One of my panels is staring to deteriorate, turn to mush. It is some type of
pressed board with a faux veneer. I was planning on replacing it. Did the
stock panel go from top to bottom?
