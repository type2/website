&gt; The problem with putting your hot oil in front of the cooling air for the 
&gt; rest of the engine is that it raises the overall temp of the engine. The

&gt; around the engine.
&gt; If you pre-heat the air you defeated the purpose.

Hi Ray,
Definitely!  Plus it restricts the flow of cooling air even more because a 
vaccum never will be a powerfull as a pressurized flow.  Thus the big reason 
VW designed the cooling fan to push the air through the cooler and engine 
fins instead of trying to suck it through.
