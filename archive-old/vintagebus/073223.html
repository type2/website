&gt; Besides, until everyone straightens out and calls ragtops by their right names, I'm going to refer to them as I see fit: saucepans.

heheh.  hey, i have one of those saucepans... even if i'm not sure if you mean a sunroof or a convertible when you use &quot;ragtop.&quot;  i guess that's the point.

this morning i endured an argument on a work-related (library) list about what area north america covered.  the list is for an organization with north america in its title but with international membership.  anyway, two geographics wanted to know if they (hawaii or greenland) counted as part of north america.  the best answer came from a librarian who quoted one of the rulebooks.  you'll be happy to know that according to rules, hawaii and greenland are both in north america.  the geographic area code lists north america as [n], greenland as [n-gl] and hawaii as [n-us-hi].  so there, no arguments.  &lt;grin&gt;

now back to buses, is it spelled &quot;buses&quot; or &quot;busses?&quot;  also are there standard terms for old vehicles and what we do with them?  do i have to call in the librarians?  &lt;grin&gt;

personally, i like to refer to my vws as 111, 141 &amp; 261 - the drivers and 151 &amp; 251 - the non-drivers.  i don't think i'm likely to start fights that way.  &lt;grin&gt;

cheers,
