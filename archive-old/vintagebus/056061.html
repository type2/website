Subject: Re: [VB] Body work tool -- shrinking

Here is a page that briefly describes it.

http://www.type2_dot_com/library/body/shrink.htm

Shinking is done with a stud gun using a special shrinking tip. You just
press the tip to the area you want to heat and press the trigger and it
heats the area to a red glow. After this, use air to cool the area to cause
the area to shrink.

&gt; Where can I go to read about metal shrinking?  I will need to be doing
some
&gt; soon.
&gt;
&gt; Could someone describe how it is done with the stud gun?
&gt;
&gt; Thanks,
&gt;

&gt;
&gt; OK this is my opinion, i like the stud puller and have used one, but i use
a
&gt; regular slide hammer dent puller which the end screws on and is tapped for
a
&gt; 1/4 thread. I take 1/4 bolts and weld them to plate of 14 ga. steel the
&gt; width i need, i tack that to the body and use it to pull by, works just as
&gt; good as a stud gun and you have a better selection of tips ready at hand
or
&gt; at your local hardware. Another point as well the 1/4 bolt will take more
&gt; abuse than the studs will. I like the shrinking tip though alot that thing
&gt; is fat. Later when funds are better i will get a stud gun setup but at
this
&gt; time i have tools i need worse..later
