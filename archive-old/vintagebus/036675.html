&gt; Yes, these 
&gt; vintage EMPI filter/pumps seem to be from the very late 1960s 
&gt; and/or the very 
&gt; early 1970s.  Definitely before VW issued the dual relief 
&gt; engine case.  To 
&gt; use one of these EMPI pumps in a dual relief cases requires 
&gt; machining of the 
&gt; oil pump outlet to match the case oil passage.

How do I determine if I need this machining done? I am running a 'universal'
case so that would make it a dual relief. Do I measure the diameter of the
oil channel in the case and machine the pump outlet to match. Can I do the
'machining' with a dremel or a drill with a small grinding bit or is this a
send it back to the machine shop exercise?  

&gt;   If anyone has anymore of these EMPI oil filter/pumps they 
&gt; would like to get 
&gt; rid of please drop us a note!    

If I ever do come across another I certainly will. It is unlikely though
since there was very little interest in tuning VW's in the 60's and 70's in
South Africa. Those people who wanted their VW to go faster usually just
shoved in a high revving waterpumper and let rip. 

Thanks for the info - again!

Michael
