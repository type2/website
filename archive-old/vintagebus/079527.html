What I really wish would happen with Ebay is that
there would be a different category for USED parts and
NEW parts, then you may be actually able to find a
deal on some used stuff, because lets face it, you
virtually never find a deal on anything NEW.
I think it's scummy to use an ad picture of a new or used part on a vintage 
box, you know, the cool blue boxes with VW hatching, giving the impression it's 
an NOS part.
