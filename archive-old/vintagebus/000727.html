Is there supposed to tbe a ground wire there goin to the body or sumthin? I

Hi David,
Well they will work, but if you can install a set of ground wires to these 
points it will help keep down grounding problems in the headlights/parking 
lights in the future.  Adding grounding wires to the rear bulb holders is 
doubly important for the tail lights!  Which interstingly enough became a VW 
bus change in about 1968-70ish to factory install a grounding system for the 
tail lights.
