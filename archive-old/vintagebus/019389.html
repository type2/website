The repros are not very good, at least not the set I'd received.  The
radiusing on the corners wasn't anywhere near correct, and didn't even
match corner-to-corner.  This isn't an AR correctness issue, but a
very fundamental *fit* issue; I think you'd have a hard time fitting
glass into those frames.  Unless someone else has gotten into the
popout market, both places were selling popouts made by Wolfgang.

&gt; I was just wondering if the after market pop out window frames were any

&gt; have experience with these? How is the fit or quality of them? Or can
&gt; someone explain how to get rusty ones apart ? thanks
