Subject: Gas gage issue

Hi all;
When I turn on the lights in my 6v bus, the gas needle goes all the way to 
full no matter how much gas is actually in the tank. When the lights are off, 
or on but with the dimmer all the way towards low light, the gage works great. 
Interestingly enough, the same thing is happening in  both of my buses, so I 
figured there was a big chance that someone else had experienced this and knew 
what is happening.
Both of my buses are 6v originally, but one of them has been transformed to 
12v. Both of their gages are 6v. I did try a 12v gage on the converted bus, 
and the symptoms are still the same! This is not the way it should work, 
right?
Thanks for any help solving this puzzle,
Cris
