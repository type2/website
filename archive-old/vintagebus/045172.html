&lt;&lt;  &lt;&lt;Anybody have any thoughts or suggestions. All the mechanics 
around say a  minimum of $1000 to replace/rebuild the tranny. I think 
I could R/R it, but  the reduction gear boxes scare me. .&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;

With:
 
&lt;  you an get a rebuilt,box to box and end to end  from a reputable 
rebuilder  such as Rancho or Carters for about 650.00 plus 150.00 
to ship. &gt;

Sounds like $800 plus core and then either R&amp;R yourself or pay 
someone $200+ to do it for you.   Right at the magic $1K mark.

PS- a complete rebuild of a redux box trans for $650 sounds a 
bit light if they are using quality parts.  $800 for that type of job
maybe a more realistic price.  Both Rancho and Carter have
excellent reputations for rebuilt transaxles. &lt;/PRE&gt;&lt;/HTML&gt;
