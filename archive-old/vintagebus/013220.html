&gt; Looking thru the july vw trends I found an ad from Kustom 1 Warehouse with a 61-67 bus trans for &quot;only&quot; $195.00 each. Has anyone ever bought one of their units and if so was it a good unit? Any other sugestions.

Well, if the $350 Carter's gearboxes are crap, how much better can
one for $195 be?  I bet the normal disposable parts (ie synchros, gasket
kit, etc) for a VW tranny cost more than that.
