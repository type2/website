Subject: Re: [VB] oil change - part two - should I worry?

&gt; &gt;It kinds sounds like a spacer washer that goes under the distributor

Hi Jason,
Yes it does, but those washers are in the rear compartment of the engine case 
where the cam gear and rear of the crank are housed.  The washers can not 
move from in there to the oil sump area!  The oil drain passages from there are 
too small.
  They can be checked/replaced by removing the distributor, the distributor 
drive, and fishing the washers out.  If you drop a washer you have to remove 
the oil pump and get them out or risk the washer/s getting between the cam and 
cam drive gear on the crank!!!!!
