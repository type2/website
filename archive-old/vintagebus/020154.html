Subject: Fr brake noise
To: &quot;vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com Vintagebus&quot; &lt;vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com&gt;

Was written about front brakes from Jim Ellis

*************The answer that I got from the shop is
that due to the lack of asbestos and increased metal
content in the shoes &quot;they all howl like that&quot;.*******

I have replaced the front shoes and have turned the
drums on three of my busses in the last two years and
never had a problem with any noise. Sound like BS to
me.
