Subject: RE: [VB] ARC vs. MIG - torsion bars

According to the 63-67 Bentleys, the welded end torsion bars are the
replacement for the separate leaf bars. Separate leaf bars were to be used
until stocks ran out, but the welded end bars were preferred.

&gt;
&gt;one set, i believe the uppers, are cracked at the welds on both ends,
&gt;so that the leafs can be separated into 3 smaler groups. the lower set
&gt;is cracked only at one end, and only for 2 of the leafs.  [...]

I only have the '63 - '67 manual as a reference, but it seems like if
the leaves were originally welded, they need to stay welded, _unless_
you change to the later torsion arms that have a washer in the end to
keep the torsion bar leaves from working outward.
