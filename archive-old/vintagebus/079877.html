Subject: Vacumn leak

Hello list -

		I had believe my motor ( single port, 009, 30/31, AS21 case, blah blah ) has
a vacumn leak.  It has never idled well unless fully warmed up, and I _think_ I can hear a sucking sound on the 3 &amp; 4 cylinder side.  

      So.. tonight I was fiddling around with things and I was pulling off the spark plug wire on each cylinder 
			If I pull off cylinder 3 &amp; 4 spark plugs wires, the engine hardly changes idle.
			If I pull off cylinder 1 &amp; 2 spark plug wires, the engine will stall.

			Do I have a vacumn leak? If so, were do I look for leaks, I tried tightening down those pesky nuts on the single port manifold to no avail..

			thanks
