Subject: Trailering Bus

Hi All-

I am going to be renting a trailer to move a 65 bus a good 800 mile and =
need to get a few spec's on what sort of trailer would be required. So my =
questions

1. How much does a 65 Bus weigh (this is just a regular van- doesn't have =
all the camper equipment in it)
2. How &quot;wide&quot; is the bus (i.e what sort of width would thr trailer have to =
be)
3. Finally would a double axle trailer be sufficient or would a tri axle =
be preferable?

Any other tips for a realtively inexperienced trailer tower would be =
apprecaited.

Thanks

Michael

Honest to God, I'm telling you the truth, you can do it yourself. For the
big money you will spend with a pro, you can do a pretty darn nice job in
your garage. The products these days go on easy and dry in about an hour. =
If
I was going to pay for anything, I'd pay for the body work. That's where =
all
the time goes.
