Well Volks,

When I took the whole fam damily down to Oz for sabbatical back in '85
for six months, we took a month of it for &quot;Holiday&quot; as the locals are
want to say.  We travelled all over the place in Vic and NSW in a '74 3
seat Holden &quot;station sedan,&quot; I think they called em.  Rob?  Andy? 
Correct me if I am wrong.

Anyway, with a big family, that can be challenging, as previously
attested by others.  Solution?  Play &quot;Spotto.&quot;  When you spot a VW, any
VW, you shout &quot;Spotto&quot; and point it out.  Pop is the arbitrator for
&quot;close calls.&quot;  You keep keen count of your &quot;spotto's&quot; for the day and
the winner gets a treat or something at the last fillup or whatever. 
Sometimes we'd break into teams, as older eyes are sharper than younger
ones . . . well, to a point, anyway.

Worked for us, with 7 kids ranging from 16 down to 18 months back in
'85.  In fact, even with most of them now married and on their own, we
still play it on the freeway up to SLC when the boyz and I  go up
together.  You can do it with Merecedes Benz's too.  BUT, to play Spotto
with American car models is absolutely HERETICAL.  

Curt
