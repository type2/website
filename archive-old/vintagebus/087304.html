Subject: Re: [VB] What ever happened to the bus boat?

Gary, I've visited a number of fiberglass shops and many of them will 
build custom molds.  You might look around your area for shops which 
build boats, race car bodies, campers and anything else made in 
fiberglass.  I'm sure if you put up the cash, someone will build you 
a mold.  I made a mold for a fiberglass canoe while in college.  It's 
not rocket science, but you do need to know a few &quot;tricks&quot;.

I would think you could sell a few if you get someone to make the mold.


&gt;The boat you are talking about was sold with the 23 window bus about 
&gt;15 years ago. Haven't heard about that one since.
&gt;I have owned a bus boat for about 13 years now.
&gt;I have been looking for someone who can help me reproduce them but 
&gt;haven't found anyone yet.
&gt;Is there anyone out there who can help me?
&gt;Gary
