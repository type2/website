I doubt they will fit with UPS's size restrictions.  I recently shipped a 
set of single cab gates from CA to Oregon, and they were too big for 
UPS.  The buyer had a &quot;Pilot Air Freight&quot; account, so we used that.  I 
think it cost him about $50, and I had to drop the gates the their hub here 
in Sacramento and he had to pick them up at the hub in Oregon.  FWIW, the 
set of gates, packed, weighed in at 103 pounds.

&gt;Does anyone have an educated guess on what the cost is to ship a complete
&gt;set of Double Cab gates?  Assume for the purposes of this exercise that
&gt;it is cross-country - CA to NY.
