I am in no way connected with this site first of all.  However, I love the 
idea!  It is completely FREE to post items up for auction as long as it is 
VW.  Pretty cool if you ask me.  BTW there is only one thing for sale right 
now.  Post stuff you don't want.  Like that ol' bus out back!

Check it out!
