Subject: RE: [VB] overseas transport??? there's a free, abandoned bus!

I just paid ~1200 to ship a single cab from Belgium to Tacoma WA.  Also, I
spoke with the Oregon dmv and they wanted *all* the paper work which means
some form of title in order to register it here in the states.  Make sure
you get some paper work for this 'abandon bus' before you get it shipped
over here and find out they need to hold on to it until you get the papers.


Which reminds me, it will arrive on Thursday 12/6... so anyone in the area,
go down to the docks and look for my green '67 tipper!!!

I'll be up to pick it up the following week sometime, AFTER the USDA steam
cleans it... a new 'requirement' for all used vehicles coming into the
states from Europe or so the lady claimed... $150 to do it!

is a 64 Kombi, right side drive, green on green,
hard-top camper in above average condition abandoned
on a street near me. I saw the owner come into the
city a coule months ago, seemed to drive well (the
bus), and pull the tags off. Under Italian law after a
given amount of time (that has already passed) you may
claim abandoned vehicles at no cost (none!!) I return
to Annapolis, Md. in about three weeks...I like
free...does anyone know approximately how about much
shipping costs would be, where I can find that out,
and/if there are any laws pertaining to both a
&quot;claimed&quot; vehicle and a right-side drive vehicle
entering the United States?? Any info you have would
be great! thanks, J.D.Wilson
