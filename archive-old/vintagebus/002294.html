Hi All,
I know this sounds like I need to sign up for the 12 step program but I need
a few small screws; I've lost mine you see ;-).

2 front turn signal indicator screws (4x10 mm) with the correct clear (no
threads) start portion on the screw
4 4x6 counter sunk raised head screws to connect pop out latch to window.
4 6 x 12 fillister screws for connecting pop out latch to body.
1 carriage bolt to fasten double cab rear bench support to cab (I have the
washer and wing nut)

Also,
1 striker and bolts for double cab rear door (is this the same for a regular
cargo door?)

You see, now that I have a copy of the official parts manual for the type 2,
I can make sure that I have even all the correct nuts and bolts!!!  Totally
retentive eh?

Thanks in advance.

David
