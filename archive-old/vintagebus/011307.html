Hello All,

    Well I have a problem and need some advice. I've been trying to get
my old side mirrors off my bus so I an install new ones. I've been using
penetrating oil for awhile now and things were going pretty well. Both
mirrors were starting to move more freely and
then.....................SNAP!  The arm on my passenger side mirror
broke off. It is now flush with the hinge. On the bottom there is about
half an inch sticking out of the hinge. What on earth do I do now? I
just shot some more oil on it, but how do I get the darn thing out of
there without causing any more damage? At least any more than is already
done. I really would like to have 2 side mirrors on the bus before
heading out to BNNTA in Sept. In advance thanks!!!!!!!!!!!
