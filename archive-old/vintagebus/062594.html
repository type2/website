Subject: RE: [VB] That 70s show bus



I though it was a 67 13 window, cumulous white, sea blue.  I remember 
because my bus should be that color!  They showed it exculively when Hyde 
put a dead phish in a dome cap!

Speaking of famous bus',  I saw an 1973 flick called 'Electroglide in Blue'  
A motorcycle cop in AZ hassled a hippie in a 63 standard.  Also notice in 
the newer flick ALI, Will Smith is in South Africa or something and there is 
a bill board w/ a Kombi!

Survive the Monday!
