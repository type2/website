Well folks, I am signing off till I get to Florida.  California has been
great but it's time to move on.  If you see a Budget moving van towing a 63
Doublecab along I-10, give us a honk and a wave.  If you see a Budget moving
van towing a 63 Doublecab broken down on the side of I-10, give us a hand
;-).

I am heading out on May 1st.  My dad has graciously offered to fly out and
drive back with me.  I am picking him up on the way to Florida from LAX.
The poor guy is flying out to turn right around and drive back.  I love that
man.

I just got done checking out the T.B.B.A.C.S. (Tampa Bay Air Cooled Car
Society) and S.P.A.C.E. (St. Petersburg Air Cooled Enthusiasts).  I was
worried that leaving the west coast would leave me devoid of VW pleasures.
Actually it looks quite the contrary.  Bulli Brigade and Bug Jam seem to be
about the same caliber as The Classic.

It was great meeting several of the listees living here in Cali.  My wife
and I have decided the Cali is our kinda livin so as soon as the Air Force
gives me the boot (hopefully not too soon) we will be back in VW Mecca.  To
all the people I have met, thanks for the VW memories.  Matt and Mandy
Souza, Don Boneau, The crew from Fresno and the infamous Arizona volks just
to name a few.  If anyone is planning on going to some of the Florida shows
look me up.

I will certainly be back on the lists as soon as we settle in.  If there is
anyone in the Tampa area please p-mail me and let me know what's going on at
chuck.jan_at_cyberdude_dot_com.

I think I have had one too many Sam Adams so I'm going to bed now.  Be back
in about a month.
