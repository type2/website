Subject: RE: [VB] accel. cable cut tranny case

Splitties DID come with a Bowden tube. I have one FOR a splitty. You can
use/mod Bug Ghia, and others and have them work. Might have to just trim
them for total length to avoid binding.
AL


 I am not sure  that the splitties came
with bowden tubes, but you can use one off a bug and it makes the gas
pedal
firmer.
