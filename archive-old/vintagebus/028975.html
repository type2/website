&gt;from a 55 (?)  (the cover page with date is gone, but the post bd bus has
bakelite interior light bulb holders, and the wierd big cover intake manifold)
 owners manual:
&gt;
Just a bit of info, I have both a '55 and a July, '57 owner's manual and
they appear identical, as far as I can tell.  VW reused the '55 photos...

What's a &quot;weird big cover intake manifold&quot;?

I looked at the pics of the my '57 manual at:
http://thesamba_dot_com/vw/type2/literature/manuals/manuals57.htm
and couldn't figure out what your statement meant.
