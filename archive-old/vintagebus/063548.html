Subject: Gas Heater trade or other parts

Hey Y'all,
I have a complete working B2 gas heater I'd like to trade for some bug parts.
I originally bought the heater to rig into my 71 Westy, but since have decided
that I don't want to drive the bus on these salty Ohio winter roads anyway. 
What I need is a front left (driver side) fender for a 66 bug, and tail light
assemblies for same bug. If you have the parts but don't want the heater, I
alaso have a myriad of other bug and bus parts including bug bumper parts,
rear fenders, and door rubber. And I have two 68-71 front bus doors in very
good condition.
I am located in Ohio and can ship most of the stuff.

Peace, John Baker
