Thanks everybody for your suggestions. I didn't fix anything today,
too busy driving my bus instead. Sure was fun zipping along on the
freeway, only occasionally glancing down and laughing at the tach
which has now chosen to read 6000rpm at 60 and 5000rpm at 50. Yeah,
right. Could be I can adjust the tach right, but really I yearn to get
rid of it and just trust the bus. I just can't figure out a place to
put it that doesn't ugly up my dash. If someone can help me with that
I might just keep it, but I am at a loss and so maybe is the tach.
I will do that turn of the engine turn of the wheels comparison
sometime soon just to learn more about my (big nut) tranny. But my
newfound path is just not to worry about it. My engine is fine, my
tranny will be fine for now. The bus feels fine at 60mph, so that is
where it will cruise until it lets me know otherwise. When I find
myself concerned about rpms I will just start thinking about global
population explosion and dwindling natural resources instead until it
doesn't seem so important anymore.
I still think I have a mismatched part on the oil bath air cleaner
setup. The fitting I have for the top of the carb, when viewed from
above, looks very much like a comma (,) and I think I need the mirror
image of this. This one I might be able to make work by means of a
funny bend in the hose between carb fitting and air cleaner, but the
mirror part would allow me a nice straight hose to the air cleaner,
which seems like it ought to be. I will look at that show next
weekend, and do what I can with what I find. The chrome dish must go!
I'll try that points adjustment again, this time going with the
tach/dwell meter and see what that gives me in feeler gauge land. Then
I am going have a go at fixing some of my rear bumper alignment
problems with the big hammer. I figure that is a great companion
project to messing about with a precise little points gap.
Sorry to the list, my bus, and busses everywhere for the comments
about overvalued scrap metal, rust, and the bottom of the river. I'm
OK now. I need to remember to stop wrenching sometimes and just drive.
I hope you all had a good weekend,
Joel and the 1964 Sundial, friends again
