thinking the accelerator pump volume? &gt;&gt;

Hi Jon,
Yes, it could be or too much fuel is being delievered.  Could also be your 
accelerator nozzle is partly clogged and/or too big or small of main jet.

&lt;&lt;Also, my case is a rebuilt one, so I don't have the number to look up what 
the timing should be, are all dual relief cases set the same?&gt;&gt;

Timing is only due to the distributor used, not the case number.
