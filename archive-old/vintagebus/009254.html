Hey Volks

Here's the first report from a young Norwegian, Espen Svensen, who is
driving &quot;Mabel&quot;, a stock 1959 Kombi, from Cape Agulhas to North Cape, the
southernmost point in Africa to the northernmost point in Europe. Enjoy!

&gt; Greetings friends all over.
&gt;
&gt; Well, here we are at Masai Camp in Arusha, 7646 kms from Cape Agulhas.
&gt; Arusha is located 80 kms west of Kilimanjaro which is the highest mountain
&gt; in Africa (5895 metres). The country is Tanzania if anybody wonders. And -
&gt; we are NOT climbing , we leave that to those who can afford it.
&gt;
&gt; Trip Report no. 1
&gt; ------------------------------
&gt; Wernher and myself started in Pretoria (South Africa) 11th of April after
I
&gt; spent about 1 month getting the car ready for the trip. After the Cape
&gt; Agulhas - Pretoria leg, I noticed that Mabel (that's my car) used a lot of
&gt; oil which she spat out through the tailpipe. New pistons and sleeves went
in
&gt; under the supervision of Werner Alker, whom I stayed with in Pretoria. I
&gt; also put in a new clutch because of some heavy vibration. With new parts
&gt; installed, but not yet tested, we set off for Norway.
&gt;
&gt; Because of the rather hostile situation in Zimbabwe, and the fact that you
&gt; have to wait a couple of hours to get a few litres of petrol, we decided
to
&gt; go through Botswana and Zambia to get to Malwi instead (Find yourself a
&gt; map). The rain that caused the floods in Mozambique had also hit northern
&gt; parts of South Africa, and only two borderposts were open. We chose to use
&gt; Groblersbrug which would give us the straightest route through Botswana.
&gt; Before we left S.A. we stocked up with biltong and droewors (the last
proper
&gt; meat for a while), and crossed the border into Botswana. When we filled
&gt; petrol in Palapye we noticed that Mabel was using a lot of oil again. Not
&gt; being able to find any leaks, I filled up with 1/2 litre Prolong and 1/2
&gt; litre oil, hoping that things would settle themselves in the engine. I
have
&gt; not filled a drop of oil since then. That first day we drove until 3 am,
&gt; covering about 1100 kms, before we pulled off the road to sleep.
&gt;
&gt; We got up at 7 am to cross the border to Zambia at Kazungula as early as
&gt; possible, but after lending tools and assistance to a broken down truck,
and
&gt; having to look for petrol in Kasane for an extra hour, we crossed on the
&gt; ferry about mid day. Customs and immigration in Zambia went easy, and 20
kms
&gt; later we found ourselves at Jungle Junction.
&gt;
&gt; Jungle Junction is a must if you are in Zambia. It is an island about 60
kms
&gt; upstream from Victoria Falls - on the Zambezi river. From the village on
the
&gt; mainland you are paddled/poled in dugout canoes (mokoro) downstream to the
&gt; island, going through some pretty hefty whitewater rapids. As you enter
the
&gt; island, time stops and all you can do is to RELAX. (This is where we
changed
&gt; to Africa time).
&gt;
&gt; We stayed 2 nights on this paradise island before we drove to Livingstone
65
&gt; kms down the road. It was too late in the afternoon to go to Lusaka, so we
&gt; spent the night at Jolly Boys to have an early start the next morning.
&gt; &quot;Early next morning&quot; became 11am before we headed off north-east. What we
&gt; remember of Zambia is:
&gt;
&gt; Police controls (11)
&gt; Potholes (1000's)
&gt; Jungle Junction (1)
&gt;
&gt; Sections of the road is quite OK, but we spent almost 3 days driving the
&gt; 1200 kms through Zambia to Malawi. In Lusaka we stayed at Chachacha
&gt; Bacpackers, where we met 4 norwegian girls that was studying HIV/Aids as a
&gt; part of their doctor studies in Norway. The next stop was a campsite in
&gt; Sinda, only 120 kms from the Malawian border.
&gt;
&gt; We passed the border early in the morning without any hassel. Wernher
wanted
&gt; some material to make pants, and the best place to buy that being the
market
&gt; in Lilongwe, we crawled through the roads of the capital city of Malawi in
&gt; search for material. I had an idea of where to find the market, but it's
&gt; hard to lookfor things and at the same time avoid the crazy taxis, so I
just
&gt; stopped the car on the side of the road while Wernher went out shopping.
He
&gt; came back 1/2 hour later with material and we were ready to continue
towards
&gt; Cape MacLear, which was our plan that evening.
&gt;
&gt; In Malwi it is hard to keep any high average speed, partly because of bad
&gt; and bumpy roads, and partly because of people. People everywhere. On the
&gt; road, in the road, at the road, crossing the road. Every few kilometers
you
&gt; find yourself slowing down because of a mass of people in the road -Bus
Stop
&gt; - men, women, children, goods, goats, cars, bicycles; everything moves
away
&gt; two seconds before you pass to let you through. I've only hit one rooster
on
&gt; all my visits to &quot;the Warm Heart of Africa&quot;
&gt;
&gt; It was already getting quite late in the afternoon when we turned off the
&gt; nice, bumpy surfaced roads, to find that the main dirtroad at Mtakataka
was
&gt; washed away. We were directed to the next turnoff (Golomoti) by some
locals
&gt; at a road-stall. The road, if you can call it that, was passable at
approx.
&gt; 25 kms an hour for the first 30 kms, sometimes having to stop because of
&gt; washed away sections and ditches across the road. It was an hour after
dark,
&gt; when we finally got to see Cape MacLear where we were going to stay for a
&gt; couple of days.
&gt;
&gt; The first evening we spent with old friends, Morne and Marinda, in their
&gt; house on the beach. We got to know their house very well on the first
&gt; evening, when Espen, rather intoxicated on Dan's whiskey, wanted to move
the
&gt; car to the front of the house, and forgot about the resently installed
&gt; roofrack. The next morning revealed the damages: The roof of the house was
&gt; moved a bit (1mtr) and the roofrack was bent. We got some local guys to
help
&gt; us push the house back in position, and put up two poles to support it.
The
&gt; roofrack needed welding, and that was arranged with Kayak Africa, whom we
&gt; spent the next 6 days with.
&gt;
&gt; From Cape Agulhas: 5163 kms (10 days)
&gt; From Pretoria: 2876 kms (7 days)
&gt;
