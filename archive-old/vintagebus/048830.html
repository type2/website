Subject: Re: [VB] DD Panels

I've always liked panels...especially DD. I favor the commercial vehicles.

My favorate models in order are:

Single cab
Panel (preferably DD)
Kombi
23 Deluxe

Even though I think double cabs are cool, I don't really like them 
for myself. I actually passed on one I found recently and gave the 
tip to a buddy of mine here who owns a shop. He immediatly bought it. 
So now we've got a Double-cab in town.

Oddly enough, I'm gonna sink the most money into the 23 deluxe I've 
got. I guess 'cause it's &quot;generally&quot; considered &quot;most desirable&quot; and 
I want to *look cool* ;)
