 What was the color and texture on the corner panel below the windows but
 above the engine tray? &gt;&gt;

The side that wrap around in the luggage compartmet/rear hatch area should be 
grey.  Just the same exact material as the front door panels/divider panel in 
the commercial busses.  The top of these panels also had a piece of plastic 
beading stapled to it to seperate from the headliner material.  The panels 
also had the round holes for the rear seat mount screws and the cut-out for 
the gas tank filler.

My 57 has these same panels with it but they are light brown to match the 
interior.

Hope this helps.
