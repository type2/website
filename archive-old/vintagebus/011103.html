Subject: steering column colour?Re: [VB] touch-up paint

the white steering column in a bus, is that the white of the interior of the 
bus, like say a 65 westy with blue white in the cab, is that the steering 
column colour, or did they have a satck of steering columns blacked black and 
a stack painted white they threw in.  the latter seems more likely, think the 
column was painted before installation,

 but what color white?  matched the bumpers silver white?  would the white be 
the same on say a 61 and a 65?
