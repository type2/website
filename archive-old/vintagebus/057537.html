Subject: Seat upolstery was Re: [VB] FS - Costco Shed

So, what you're saying is that when new, it cost about

$175, but for just replacement panels its $200?  Are 
you paying someone $25 to take it away? LOL!!  Put it 
up on ebay, you might actually be able to sell it.

On a bus related topic, what is the material 
underneath the seats in between the horsehair padding 
and the springs?  Also, when reupolstering, should 
I go with OEM-style horsehair padding or something 
more modern?

Thanks,
Paul

&gt; &gt; I just submitted my plans for a permit to build my
&gt; new garage,
&gt; &gt; and won't be needing the Cozmo tarp-shed setup
&gt; anymore.  The
&gt; &gt; existing panels are toast, but the poles are in
&gt; good shape.  It
&gt; &gt; comes with brand new (NOS!) panels and NOS
&gt; dingleberries to attach
&gt; &gt; them.  It was almost $200 for the new panels! 
&gt; Also - it comes with
&gt; &gt; an extra end panel (NOS!) so that you can fashion
&gt; a door.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I'm in the Sacramento area and can deliver
&gt; locally.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; New, I think they're $175, when they have them in
&gt; stock.  Make a reasonable
&gt; &gt; offer.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I also have some other various bus parts FS that
&gt; I'll be liquidating
&gt; &gt; over the next couple of weeks - I have to pay for
&gt; this garage somehow!
