Subject: Re: [T2] Re: Rear Hatch Seal Fit?

Bus Depot had German or Euro seals on sale for $59 for a long time but by 
the time I decided to spring they went up to $79.
The compressing-stretching technique makes sense. I think I have it stitched 
too much in some places and compressed elsewhere.

&gt;You actually aren't far off...

When I did mine, I had to compress some sections and stretch others to
line everything up correctly. You'll notice there are several joints
where the pieces are glued together. Be careful stretching there. You
may even want to yank on the seal to separate those on purpose and
re-glue them with better adhesive because they may come apart as the
seal shrinks and expands over time.

The seal is molded with humps where they go over the waist of the bus.
I started there on both sides and massaged the seal to line everything
else up.

Where did you pay $80 for it? I paid $25 just over a year ago!!!
