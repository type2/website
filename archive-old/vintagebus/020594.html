Subject: Sacramento Samba Society _at_ Pescados
To: list bus &lt;vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com&gt;

I am taking a whirl at running the NEATO chapter here
in Sacramento. I will be trying to get a gathering at
Pescados on Fair Oaks Blvd next month. This is the
same place the Bus Farmers had there meeting and in
case you didn't know, they have a side of a bus
hanging up inside the restaurant (can be seen on
Everett's). So if you don't care about the club, but
haven't seen the bus in the restaurant, then come by.
But remember, come in a bus, or don't come at all. If
you need more info p-mail me.

Mike
