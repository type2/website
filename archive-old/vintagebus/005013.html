With my Izzs safari's I had the same problem the rubber &quot;appearing&quot; to be
too long.  When I first put them in, I had 4&quot; of extra rubber I couldn't get
on the rail.  Turns out I was pulling (stretching) it just slightly enough
to give me all that excess.  Don't pull or stretch it at all. Actually, try
and push it &gt;together&lt; at the corners and it should fit.

 Also, I noticed that the rubber seals (WCM) stretch quite a bit and I
always
 ended up with extra that could not be crammed into the rail... even though
I
 soaped everything up real good.  How do you do it right?  But then again,
 maybe this happened since my glass is the wrong size.
