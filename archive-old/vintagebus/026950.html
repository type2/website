Subject: getting off my lazy a$$

well...after a little sickness spell I'm back on my feet...
I don't know why...but I've been looking for another (running...or very
near running and driving) bus to buy... I think because my &quot;reliable&quot;
transportation ('90 Ponti_at_c Gr_at_nd Pr!x) is getting sold out from under
me... and I'm getting some money from it... so after 3 failed attempts
to buy a bus (all were sold already) I said FUNK IT! and headed over to
the shop to do some work.  I made my nose look presentable...thanks
bondo!! (yeah...bondo..I'm a sinner...but I don't have $$ for a new
nose..or time to weld one in) and I banged out a big nasty dent so that
it looks somewhat better...not a whole lot...but its not as bad as it
was.  I'm leaving all dents the way they are... dented (I had to use
bondo to seal a gash in the nose :(   it adds character.  I painted a
bunch more tonight too...  I've got another night or two of body work
ahead of me after I order my metal... then I'm on to the other stuff...
This bus will look great.............20' away:) and then people will
step up and see it and just frown...HAHA!! I could care less.  Its my
bus...and thats that.
so next is welding (still have to cut out a rocker and a bit of the
cargo floor... and then welding in of stuff.  Then I get to do the
wiring....then the seals...and then the motor.... then the brakes... etc
etc...

2 hrs tonight got a LOT done.... I'm pleased...now I'll stop looking for
another bus and get my rear in gear and work on the one I have.

Just a little informative note....
I think now that I have some more motivation... I can keep going on
this... 2 hrs per night gets a lot done...pretty fast.
