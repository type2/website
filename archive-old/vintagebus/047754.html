 until the sump is cold to the touch. Is this unwise? &gt;&gt;
Hi Michael,
That should work just fine if you mean cold by outside temp in the shade or 
room temp if you are talking about inside the garage.  

&quot;The valve clearance can be checked and adjusted when the engine is cold or 
up to a maximum oil temperature of 50C (122F).&quot;  From the 1963-67 VW bus shop 
manual.
Interestingly the VW shops had a fan device to suck air through the rear 
bottom of the engine to cool the engine enough to properly adjust the valves. 
 This same fan system was used to suck air out of the interior of the VWs 
with the heaters open and the fan opening blocked.  This would create a low 
pressure inside the VW replicating highway speed conditions.  With a 
repairman inside looking for leaks and another outside spraying the VWs 
windows with water that would be sucked in around any window seals which 
showed where more body to window seal sealant was needed.
