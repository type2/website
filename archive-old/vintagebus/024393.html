&gt; Would you mind sending me their info?

Yikes!! I've gotten LOTS of pmail requests for this company's
mailing/contact info.  Before I do that, I would like to verify that the
screws are as they claim and are a reasonable if not exact match for the
original ones.  They said that they would try and get the package out to
me in today's UPS shipment.  If all goes well, I should be reporting back
to the list as soon as this weekend.  At that time, I will provide their
contact info and even the name of the nice young lady that took care of my
order.

One of the listees sent me the name of a company called Fastenal and they
happen to have an outlet about 4 long blocks (1 mile) from my office.  I'm
going to swing by there tomorrow (Wed) and see if they are also a source
for these screws.

Updates will be on their way, I promise.
