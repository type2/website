Subject: Mufflers and hitches

Hey everybody! My crew cab has one of those mufflers that goes up into the
fender and then tucks back down behind the rear bumper. I need to put a
trailer hitch on it to pull my little pop-up camper, and I think the header
is in the way. I think the stock type bus muffler looks good, but a friend
of mine says he went back to one and lost power. I need all the power I can
get since I will be pulling a trailer. I'm running a 1600 DP with dual
Kadrons. Who sells the stainless bus mufflers, has anyone had any experience
with them? Lastly, does any one have some good pics of a hitch or one for
sale? I'm in the metal trades so if I had an idea of how they are built I
could fabricate my own. Thanks for all the help people!
