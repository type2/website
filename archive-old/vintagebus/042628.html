Subject: [VB] archive down tire/rust remover question...

hello all,

i have a set of 15 inch rims now and want to buy tires for them (yeah i
know, i still dont have a split but am working on it)

first question:
what readily available modern tire (read cheap i/e 195/75 15??) comes
closest to achieving the same rolling diameter as the original tires
fitted to the bus and will still fit in 62 or older wheelwells? (or 63 and
newer if that is a different spec.)

second question:
my rims need some minor rust removal, i plan on using a convertor... kano
labs (makers of kroil) sell a rust conversion liquid.  I am pretty sure
its just phosphoric acid, but i am unsure what strength to get if i just
go to a chemical supply place and ask for a 2 gallon jug of phosphoric
acid. (i checked the library, the author of the article there was unsure
of dilution/strength to buy too...)

the main reason i wanted to get the kano labs product is i dont want to go
through a chemical supply house and get straight phosphoric acid and have
it be so strong it burns my clothes off, or so weak it does nothing to the
rust... anyone have any ideas? or any experience with the kano labs
product? (im sure going through a chem supply outfit would be cheaper, so
i'd prefer that route...)

thanks,

Steve
