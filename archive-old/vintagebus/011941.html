&gt; &gt; I have never had any experience with torsion bars. Rumour has it
you can
&gt; &gt;  &quot;crank them up&quot; to compensate for sagging. Has anyone done this?

&gt; you can set them quite accurately to within less than a degree
&gt; (measured on the spring plate, with the plate pulled out past the
&gt; lower bump stop).

&gt; We just did this with my truck, a '59 single cab) to very good
&gt; effect. You DO want to use a protractor, though, and I can certainly
&gt; recommend the electronic ones as being quite effective. Take your time
&gt; and measure a lot and you'll do fine.

That's a lot of bux for a simple job!  I used a simple $1.00 plastic
protractor, a piece of thread and a nut for a plumb bob.  Worked just
fine and gave me 1/2 degree accuracy, which is better than the 40
arc-minute adjusting steps of the torsion bars.

My bit 'o advice:  Pay close attention to the specs and get the bars
set right.  Avoid the temptation to crank in a bit extra twist, as you
will end up too high and with strange handling.  Level the bus
front-to-rear before starting.  Be sure to hold the spring plate up to
take the play out of the splines when taking measurements.  Hit all
the bolts with penetrating oil for a couple of days before starting.

Have fun!
