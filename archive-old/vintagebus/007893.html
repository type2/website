&gt;...I am going to sell my '53.  In away I kind of hate to, I really like it.
But bottom line is it rides like a John Deere tractor which all but rules it
out for long distance trips...
&gt;
Grease the front end A LOT, if you have a small grease gun, I'm talking like
100 pumps for each of the 4 main zerk fittings.  It will ride nicer.
Barndoors need to be greased every 600 miles for the link pins and tie rods
and every 1200 for the main beam.

&gt; I will be putting this on Ebay Thursday night.
&gt;
So are you taking offers until then or are you just a tease?  ;)   Just
curious, I would like to pass the info on to a non-listee here in Phoenix.
