&gt; &gt; &gt; Then you also have to take into account that it is a climate controlled

&gt; &gt; No, it's better.  The &quot;real world&quot; is a horrible place to test chantes in
&gt; &gt; engine configuration.  Too many uncontrolled variables.

&gt; No, it's worse. I don't know anybody that drives thier bus in a climate
&gt; controlled booth during a road trip. Do you?

The advantage of a controlled environment in evaluating changes
is obvious.  It's a luxury I would love to have, and I have a lot of
respect for someone who goes to the all the expense to create it.  There
is value in &quot;seat of the pants&quot; testing, but no researcher would turn down
the opportunity to experiment in a well-controlled environment if that
opportunity existed.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Then I have people say that it probably isn't smart to remove the front
&gt; tin.
&gt; &gt; &gt; They say things along the lines that it's not a good idea to second
&gt; guess
&gt; &gt; &gt; the German Engineers and all that jazz.

&gt; &gt; Well, opening the engine bay up for hot air recirculation doesn't seem too
&gt; &gt; bright to me.  The &quot;dryer duct&quot; idea was much smarter, provided that the
&gt; &gt; ducts were carried far enough forward to get them out of the dust kicked
&gt; &gt; up by the front wheels.

&gt; Who said anything about hot air recirculating? Tell you what, George, I
&gt; daily drove my 64 delux while living in Vegas with temps well over 100
&gt; degrees with no &quot;recirculation&quot; issues with that tin removed. 34 mile drive
&gt; to work, half highway, half gridlock on the side streets. Never a cooling
&gt; issue with my motor. I ran oil and head temp gauges and monitored what was
&gt; going on with my motor.

Look, you have a big fan pushing air out the botton of the bus.  If you
have a big opening nearby pulling air from the bottom of the bus into the
engine bay the air is going to take the path of least resistance, which
means that the air will be recirculated unless there is a big slipstream
to carry it away.  In addition, the airflow around the rear of a vehicle
isn't as smooth and predictable as we would like.  You may have gotten
away with this, but that doesn't mean the the people who follow your
advice will.

More about recirculation below.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Well, anyone that sticks a doghouse
&gt; &gt; &gt; cooler into a split bus is second guessing the german engineers and how
&gt; the
&gt; &gt; &gt; split bus was designed to run.

&gt; &gt; Well, the engineers would have put a doghouse cooler in the split bus if
&gt; &gt; it was available.

&gt; Obviously.

&gt; &gt; They might also have increased the intake area to match.

&gt; Even more obvious. Look at the Type 1 as a comparison. Watch the progression
&gt; of the intake area for the engine through those years as they went to the
&gt; doghouse.

The counterexample is the Type 2, with no changes in intake area when the
doghouse was introduced.

&gt; &gt; Even with the stock intake area the doghouse is a good idea, since
&gt; &gt; there is always a little tolerance designed into every system.

&gt; Check for the &quot;tolerance&quot; with the split window bus. There is no tolerance
&gt; built into it. I've done the tests, and share the information i've gathered
&gt; from that. If you choose to ignore it, that's up to you.

Yes, you've done the tests but what was the engineer's intent for the
acceptable pressure drop through the intake ducts?  Unless you have
happened upon a VW cooling engineer's notebook I doubt that you know any
more about that than the rest of us.

&gt; &gt; &gt; The split bus was not designed to have and
&gt; &gt; &gt; engine that pulls as much air as a 1600 dualport with a doghouse shroud
&gt; and
&gt; &gt; &gt; run cool. By the time VW put a doghouse in a bus (1971), they had
&gt; scooped
&gt; &gt; &gt; the intakes to relieve engine bay vacuum to assist in cooling.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Not really true.  Take a look at those &quot;scoops&quot; and you'll see that the
&gt; &gt; plane of the opening is about 60 degrees from the fore-aft axis of the
&gt; &gt; bus.  They face more sideways than forward!  The outer lip only extends
&gt; &gt; about 3/4 inch out from the bodywork of the bus, which means that it is
&gt; &gt; completely within the boundary layer
&gt;
&gt; What did I say that wasn't true?

&quot;...to relieve engine bay vacuum.&quot;

&gt; You might want to re-read what I wrote. As
&gt; for the &quot;intake&quot; on a bay window bus, yes the &quot;grill&quot; over the opening is at
&gt; an angle, but simple physics explains that it's going to be how far the
&gt; scoop sticks out from the car rather than the angle of the intake grill that
&gt; will dictate if air will &quot;ram&quot; into it.

Exactly, and the baywindow scoops don't stick out enough to get out of the
boundary layer.

&gt; You need to take a close look at the
&gt; intake design of a bay window a lot better than you have. From the main
&gt; bodywork, they protrude a full 1 1/2&quot; for the opening from the edge of the
&gt; body line. Then look inside the scoop and you'll see it slopes inward quite
&gt; aggresivley. This allows the air to follow the bodyline and take even more
&gt; advantage of the &quot;scoop&quot; effect. You're way off on your thought on this one.

Get out your ruler again.  At its _maximum_ extent, the &quot;scoop&quot;
extends _one_ inch from the body, and most of the scoop extends less than
this value.  I'm being generous here and measuring to the outside of
the rounded lip, not to the inside of the opening.  The &quot;scoops&quot; are
located at the far aft end of the bus, ensuring that the scoop is well
within the boundary layer.  Since you're a &quot;try it yourself&quot; guy, I
suggest that you stick your finger one inch outside the window while
driving your bus and see how much slipstream you feel.

The shape of the inside of the ducts has nothing to do with the pressure
gain.  It's just a plenum, and its shape is determined by the exterior
contour of the bus.


&gt; Quick fix? I've driven my buses like this for YEARS. And believe me, the
&gt; 25,000 miles a year I rack on my buses i've been in every situation you can
&gt; think of. Head winds, side winds, tail winds, grid lock in 120 degree heat,
&gt; fully loaded, floored for 600+ miles at a time, long dirt-road driving (80+
&gt; miles),

Sorry, but I just can't believe that you would recommend dirt road driving
without a front tin.  Even with a well-sealed engine bay more dust than I
like will infiltrate during dirt road travel.  Without a front tin a huge
amount of dust will get into the engine bay, cooling ductwork, and air
filter.

&gt; etc, etc. A &quot;quick fix&quot; does not keep and engine perfectly cool for
&gt; years of hard use. Yes there is a risk of pulling in a bunch of leaves into
&gt; the fan, or a plastic shopping bag, but you also risk that with getting
&gt; something sucked onto your side louvers (I've had a plastick shopping bag
&gt; suck onto the side louvers of my bus before (back when I ran the front tin)
&gt; so I see no difference.

My experience is different.  I've never had anything bigger than a leaf
come in through the stock cooling vents.  The chances of something getting
in via a missing front tin is obviously greater.

When I said &quot;quick fix&quot; I was referring to the simple discarding of the
front tin.  I have much less problem with well-engineered modifications,
such as cooling air ducted through the front tin from the front of the
bus.  At least in this case, the modifier considered a way to achieve the
desired result without causing other problems.

&gt; But what it comes down to, George, is that you have ZERO experience in
&gt; testing for engine bay vacuum, ZERO experience in testing for what effect is
&gt; has on the cooling system, ZERO effect on monitoring fan shroud pressure in
&gt; regard to head temps and engine bay vacuum, and ZERO experience in testing
&gt; how a bus engine will run with the front tin removed. But you try to hold an
&gt; arguement against actual results that I have gathered with ideas that what I
&gt; have done. The results i've gathered so clearly knock out the points you try
&gt; to argue that I can't understand what ground you are trying to hold.

I suggest that you check to see what work I _have_ done before making
such accusations.  This topic has been discussed previously although
the discussion centered upon missing engine bay seals, not discarding
the front tin.  I measured the difference in inlet and engine bay
temperatures and found the delta T to be about 3C under the
same conditions with good seals.  The important result was that missing
engine seals make a _big_ difference in engine bay temperatures, on the
order of 10-15C, due to recirculation.  Whether you acknowlege it or not,
recirculation can occur.

I haven't and don't intend to test my bus without a front tin, because I
understand the function of that tin and I have no intention of running
without it.  I'd just as soon go without the windshield.

&gt; Do me a favor, George. Do the same testing I have done, then come back to
&gt; this discussion with your results. I've gone through the hell of trying
&gt; every combonation I could think of with my buses and am sharing my findings
&gt; with fellow people in the bus community. To reply to someone elses actual
&gt; experiences and shoot them down acting as if they have no credibility while
&gt; you have no experience of your own to base anything on is incredibly
&gt; insulting.

I'm sorry you feel that way,  but the fact is that you are promoting
radical changes in the cooling system while ignoring the obvious
downsides.  If my pointing out these downsides causes you distress there
is little I can do about it.  You may have had satisfactory results in
your particular situation, but those results may not be realized by
other bus owners, and in fact your changes may cause severe problems
for them.  They can read all sides of the discussion and make their own
decisions.

George
