Subject: My newest Veedub!

Howdy,

Wanted to share with the list the newest VW I picked up, a 1963 Single cab.
A year and a half after getting my '66 Deluxe, I now think I have the, 'the
more VW's the better bug'.    The SC is in need of mucho work, but a fun
project it will certainly be. So, if anyone has extra SC parts sitting
around collecting dust, let me know, I need just about everything.  
Thanks a bunch,

Gary
Round Rock, TX
