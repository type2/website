&lt;&lt; Plus, anyone who travels freeway speeds with an old bus in tow is
 just asking for trouble no matter how they tow it short of using a
 trailer.... &gt;&gt;

Doesn't anybody worry about the antique reduction boxes on our busses when 
we're picking up a bus that hasn't rolled in ten or twenty years?  I never do 
more than roll a bus onto my trailer until I've gone thru everything (or at 
least topped up the trans and reduction boxes (not to mention the front 
beam)).  

OK, with the Jerome raffle bus, or another that is of a known quality, fine, 
but most of the busses I pick up have been sitting a while - no way am I 
going to trust 20+ year old grease or an amateur axle nut torque or bearing 
adjustment!  Trailer 'em until you KNOW!

My trailer may weigh a ton, but there's no way I'm going to wreck a reduction 
box or lose a vehicle to a locked front wheel bearing if I can help it.  
That's why I still own and insure my Ch_at_vy truck and heavy trailer.
