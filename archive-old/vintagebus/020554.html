Ah, yes Jim, the but the same thing is happening to
our GREAT &lt;:~( American IRON,. My wife's Astro is 12
years old and they are many parts for it that are NLA
and it becomes a wrecking yard nightmare to find these
mundane parts to keep it on the road.&lt;snip&gt;So you see
it's not just the VW's where parts are getting
inferior and more pricey but to the Great American
iron also. You see it's not just VW parts but all
parts for all cars in general.
sh#t just seems to keep happening...
------------------------------------
All understood. Didn't mean to get totally all gloomy
and stuff but in general hate to see it all
deteriorate. Primarily posted the piece as a
conversation starter and playing the Devils'
Advocate/provocateur. I am the first one to apparently
be potentially guilty of my reference to the ex-Jocks
reminiscing about the recent good ol' glory days. VW
parts and car/buses availability are not the same but
stuff happens and life goes on. 
The costs and problems relating to other vehicles are
kind of expected-they are only vehicles. They &quot;ain't&quot;
aircooled VWs! =) Even with my kvetching, aircooled VW
parts are understood to be realatively inexpensive
compared to other marques, models or other generations
of vehicles. Keep in mind that the '93 non-vw that I'm
always teasing about is the newest vehicle that I've
ever owned. Even it has 155k on the clock. The other
one has 162k on the ticker. I'll be stepping up to the
parts counter along the way for sure.

Like I said in the last post- Thanks to you, Ron
Salmon and all of the many, many, other vendors,
suppliers and show promoters for supporting our
collective interests and helping to keep the (VW) love
alive. =)

Now about those parts that I need to order...
