Subject: Re: [VB] Hackboy wants to play games, again.

who's a hack??  Last time I checked, a Behr scoop is an original VW
accessory, for barndoors i might add. What about you hacking up late NOS
ribbed bumpers just so you can be &quot;correct&quot; and have the right length ribs
for your 55 westy?  Im sure that doesn't count does it Hackboy, you'll
prolly deny it anyway, oh well.

I *should* hack in the walkthru, id like a barndoor walkthru anyway. Plus,
I now have a birth certificate from the official VW museum of Germany,
*hand* signed by Dr. B wiersch and Chr. Neefe, proving that it is an
original walk-thru! sweet
