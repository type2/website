Hi everyone,

I'm planning to redo all the paneling and woodwork in the back of my E-Z Camper that was &quot;re-done&quot; by the PO.  All of the original cabinets are unusable and will be replaced with new ones of similar design but I will be making a few subtle changes to help make it a little more personal.  I'm not going to get all anal about staying OEM since an E-Z is a &quot;factory done Hack-job&quot; anyway ;-)

My questions are these:

1.  With the original side paneling long gone and some cheesy stuff in it's place, what direction does the woodgrain go??  Up/down or front/back??

2.  I'm planning to do all the wood using birch plywood of various thicknesses with the cabinet doors and trim pieces made of solid birch wood.  Is 1/4&quot; recommended for the cabinet shells or would 3/8&quot; or thicker be better??

3.  Has anyone successfully gotten the left side paneling to bend around the back corner??  If so, how did you do it??  A steam cabinet or similar??  Or do most just add a small cabinet in that corner and forget trying to bend it??

Well, that's all I can think of for now.  Thanks in advance,
