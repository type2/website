It is definately kinda tough to  find parts in Alaska,luckily there is alot
of type I stuff around,but anything for a splity is pretty unheard of.I have
tracked down 5 others in anchorage and those folks dont have any parts
either!There is one aircooled mechanic in Anchorage though,the guy seems
like a real ass, but he has been around for years and seems to know his
stuff.I do have two extra single port 1500's floating around for some spare
parts.When you make it to anchorage feel free to look me up even if you dont
need any help.
