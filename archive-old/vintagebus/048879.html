Subject: Door alignment question

Hi list!

After 9 months in the body shop, anxious to get my DC back, I 
foolishly agreed to reinstall the front windows and frames.  Now I 
know how hard it is to put those puppies together!

My question is: The doors seem to be sagging a bit in the rear - 
which of course I didn't notice before the bus was painted. I was 
considering installing a washer or two on the inside of the lower 
door hinge, in hopes of regaining the proper alignment for the door. 
Anybody done this?  Will it work?  Better ideas?
