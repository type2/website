Hi Sam and all,

Please put me on the list as interested in a &quot;Vintagebus List 2001
Calendar&quot;.

Also, for the event listings on the calendar, the event that I host near
St. Louis, MO, called &quot;Busses Nowhere Near The Arch #17&quot; will be held over
the Labor Day weekend in 2001.  It is the largest gathering of Type 2's in
the Midwest!  The dates will be August 31st  thru  Sept 3rd, 2001, and it
will be held at the Indian Creek Recreational Area&quot;s group campground on
Mark Twain Lake, about 30 miles from the city of Hannibal, MO.  

Thanks for listing the major Bus events, it's a great addition for year
round planning, which is what a calendar is all about, isn't it?
