&gt; Man that sounds like a lot of work!  I'd rather work on the bus than scan pix almost any day... (which is why my site doesn't get updated as frequently)

Not really, the term &quot;idiot savant&quot; has been used.  ;)

I work on my Notch more thus no Vintage Bus messages, anybody have a Binz to trade for it?  I'm dead serious.  Dammit, where's that super rusty one that was on eBay?!?  (Bus content)

Let's see, what have I done on my Bus lately?  Nothing that merits a report.  I sold about $1000 of parts off, that was nice of me.  :p

I worked on other people's Barndoors, which then either got sideswiped ('52 Panel) or they blew their engine ('53 Std).  Jim Ellis, you better get your '54 blessed or something, it's going down!

'55 Kombi - needs middle seat spring assemblies!
