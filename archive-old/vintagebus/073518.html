Subject: Re: [VB] Bigger rubber bump-stops on axels...how do they mount?

&gt; I have both rubber bumpers that sit on the axels, but one came off in my hand.
&gt; 
&gt; Was there a shaft or something that was in the center of 
&gt; the dish that the bumper sat one?
&gt; 
&gt; If there was, said shaft is no more.

ya, there cae with a sort of dish with a bump in the middle.  You could squish the hole in the bottom of the bumper over the bump on the axle tube.

The bumps can rust off.

also, theses were only added ~ 65.  so there are 64 axle tubes around that do not have places for the bumpers to stick on.  

so either you can try to stick something in there, or not worry about it.  I'm not sure how much they do anyway.
