Subject: Re: [VB] steering

&gt;I have been asked many times and never had the answer to what went
&gt;around the steering column at the floor.  [Found on 15-window Deluxe:]
&gt;Mind you it wasn't a grommet like bugs have but a flat piece of rubber
&gt;fitted around the column sealing the gap between the column and the
&gt;floor, held in place by the floor mat.

I just checked my Bus ('64 Standard, built Nov. '63) and it has this.
It's a flat rubber ring about 10 mm bigger in diameter than the steering
column or 5 mm wide all around.

&gt;ps; there is also a rubber plug in the floor under the clutch pedal
&gt;about 3/8 of an inch in diameter.

I have this too, and I have two guesses about it.  One, it gives access
to something on the bottom side (like part of the clutch linkage, maybe).
Two, some countries or customers might have asked for a clutch safety
switch (starter won't run unless clutch is in), and that looks like a
good place for one.  I've never seen one of these - it's just a guess.
