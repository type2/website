For cleaning paint guns which are aluminum, soaking in carburator
cleaner is the best. It takes the paint and junk right off and is not
corrosive like acid is on the skin. Just don't expose yourself too long
or you might have problems. Case halves should be boiled from what I've
heard but carburator cleaner as a first step might be good to get the
gummy build up off. Then boil with water.

&gt; &gt;#4--brand new case,, It has been machined for bigger jugs,,  I usually
&gt; &gt;have my used cases professionally cleaned but have been told I can clean
&gt; &gt;it myself.  What cleaning fluids have you guys had good luck with ?
&gt; 
&gt; I remember this guy who had a Peterbuilt with aluminum wheels. He used to
&gt; use some kind of acid to clean them, but you had to be very careful with it.
&gt; Anyone know about cleaning aluminum with acid? How about cleaning magnesium?
&gt;
