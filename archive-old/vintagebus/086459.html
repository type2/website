My '66 13 Window celebrates the Big 4-0 next month, I'm thinking of having a
get together, inviting everybody I know, drink a few beers and just hang
out....kinda fits in the spirit of what our old buses do for us and others,
bring a smile to folks.

Well today my 66 westy turned the big four-oh. I put a CDI ignition 
system in it a few nights ago for a bday present. It's been a great bus 
for three years to me and I hope to see it turn many more milestones. 
Just thought I would share.
