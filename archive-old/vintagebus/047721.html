A quick note...Tempered glass CANNOT be cut.  The slight amount of heat
differential, as well as the spreading of the crack, will cause the whole
piece to explode.  Dont believe me?  Find an old, fogged, piece of
tempered glass you dont care about.  Take it to your belt sander, and
slowly begin to try to polish the edge.  Be sure you wear gloves!

tempered glass doesn't fog.   fogging is in between the layers of laminated
glass
