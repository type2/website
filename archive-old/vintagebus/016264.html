Hey all,

Got a 66 13 window deluxe about 3 weeks ago.  Drove it home 2hrs and would 
miss out from time to time and running hot.  Finally got home changed the 
oil and has been a dependeble daily driver 30miles a day to work.  2 weeks 
ago drove 2hrs both ways on a trip and was great.  Last weekend with last 
weeks confidence tryed a 4hr trip, fine there...On the way back would miss 
out intensely after about 1hr on the highway at 60-65mph.  Acted like it was 
hot but really wasn't.   After stranded for a day took it to vw shop and got 
a new fuel filter, fuel pump, plug wires, and points.  The points were 
pitted and was told my coil could be running hot or something.  She drove 
good yesterday and today notice symptoms of the same problem is occuring.  
Looking for any advice to cure this.  Just changed the oil with Castrol 
straight 40 and changed the oil in the tranny and gear reduction boxes.  
Should I check my points and get a new coil?  Sorry about the detail but I 
don't know the bus that well yet so I'd though I'd give you the whole thing.

Thanks,

Eric
