I bought a bus with one of those steps on the passenger side that hook up into
the jack points.  It was rather rusted in there so I beat on it and it came
out easily.  But I think I'm missing a part or something because I don't know
how it stays in there without rust.  How are they locked in there?  Any help
would be appreciated!
