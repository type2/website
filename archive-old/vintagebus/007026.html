I will disagree here, especially since it is Friday :)

If you have no experience doing brakes on any vehicle, it isn't intuitive at
all.  I've watched experienced people like Ronnie do it -- and I can follow
along, but knowing what to do entirely on my own is not trivial.

In fact, ever VW Bus I've worked on to do brakes had complications... '63
and earlier my drums are over worn and hard to find NEW replacements; 64 and
later the rear axle nut takes special tools (or special strength)...

And it isn't just me, at least one PO (who was a listee) had trouble :)
Thom F can vouch that when I first got my '63 Double Cab -- I pulled up to
his house with the front brakes almost in flames :)  PO just adjusted the
brakes, and it was my first time driving a split -- so I didn't realize it
wasn't right... lucky Thom offered to help me get the truck ready for my 800
mile trip (which went without further incident), otherwise I would have had
a very non-fun trip.

And Ronnie can vouch how my fouled up '67 Westy metal brake line between
top/bottom cylinders on the front wasted him at least 1 hour, let alone how
long it would have taken me (novice) to realize that something wasn't right.

  -- My point --

If everything were perfect in the first place, routine brake maintenance is
within grasp of a novice -- but when the bus has 30 years of mismatched or
abused parts, plus the fact the brake systems are not very strong in the
first place --- Paying someone $700 for a FULL BRAKE JOB isn't out of
reason.  Ronnie's estimate is right along my experience talking to people
who have done the full job.  And mind you, this isn't major oddball stuff
like the '67 MC, new drums, etc.  Of course, I would request a very detailed
estimate before agreeing to $700 - line item of every part and every task,
none of that &quot;three lines of chicken scratch&quot; garage receipt.

  -- Yes, do it yourself --

There are good reasons to do it yourself... especially the knowledge gained
so when the brakes have problems out in the middle of 1500 mile trip -- that
at least I have a clue what was going on.  Doing the work yourself, at least
you likely know the cause of a problem :)

P.S.  Friday PS... http://www.oldvolks_dot_com/ is getting 5 to 1 Internet
Explorer browser users over Netscape Communicator browser users.  Are any of
you Netscape users having problems with the home page?  I've tested it with
Linux + Windows 98 + Windows 2000; If you use Netscape and don't mind
visiting the site -- let me know if you encounter any errors on the pages...
I don't think there are, but it is a surprise to me how few Netscape users
are hitting the site.  If you follow-up on this, please email me direct and
don't post to the list.

Make your way to Albuquerque and hook up with JP
Henrikse at the Bus Co-op &lt;JPHenrikse_at_aol_dot_com&gt; or
order a Bentley's Workshop Manual 1963-1967 and do it
yourself. Doing a brake job &quot;the right way&quot; is not
hard even for a novice mechanic. It is *very* basic. A
few tricks help but is basically watching how parts
come apart and replacing them the same way.
First determine/isolate the systems' fault(s) prior to
abitrarily replacing everything just for the fun of
spending money. Repair and/or replace the offending
problem or part(s). I do agree that brakes are not a
system to skimp on. Make sure that the system is solid
prior to driving your beast! Keeping your health is a
priority. 

Don't be afraid of anything exception being the ripoff
artist who floated the $700 bid. There are only five
million VW bus lovers in New Mexico. Swing a dead cat
on a short rope and you'll probably hit one.
