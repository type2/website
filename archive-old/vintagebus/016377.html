Hello All,
Another understanding wife story.  As most of you realize, not all spouses 
understand our VW affliction.  My wife has always tolerated my obsessions 
with a sigh and that &quot;well I knew you were this way when I married you 20 
years ago&quot; look.  It is usually me with the wisecrack so this struck me as 
funny.
  A couple of weeks ago I had the poptop off the Westy getting ready to have 
it refinished.  I told my wife, &quot;I'll have the top back on by this weekend&quot;. 
  She just looked at me and said, &quot;Why not just leave it off?&quot;
I looked back at her with a buslier than thou smirk and asked.  &quot;Why would I 
leave the top off a poptop bus?  She calmly replied, &quot;It would make it a lot 
easier to pour you money into it&quot;, and walked away.
