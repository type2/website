Actually, no, it isn't.  I'm not a big fan of it.
There is a guy there who happens to make drums.  He does real good work 
from what I can see, and has about 10 finished ones lying about.  I'm 
not a drummer myself, in fact I'm not that great at it at all.  They 
were just there and we picked em up and banged on em a bit.  It wasn't 
like we had a &quot;circle&quot; of 20 people or anything. I guess its just fun to 
bang on stuff :)

I don't consider myself a &quot;hippie&quot;, maybe a closet hippie.  I mean, 
short hair, don't smoke dope, &quot;normal&quot; clothes.  But hey, I drive a bus 
and hit drums every once in a while, so there has to be some hippie in me 8)

&gt; OK, this has got to be a euphemism for smoking pot...no??  I guess I must
&gt; fall somewhere in-between the OG and new wave hippies.  I just have never
&gt; had a hankering to go in a do a bit of hand drumming.
