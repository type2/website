Subject: inverters/converters/capacitors/fuses

as per list reccommendations i have been to the local radio shack and not
only did they have the 8amp fuse, but they had a fast acting and a slow blow
version of the fuse. any recommendations either way? i assume the slow burn
is for devices that have spike surges-but don't want ot blow the fuse all
the time...

I also picked up a 470 microfarad capacitor to try to repair the second
inverter i have. this one does not have an arrow on it, so i guess it is
non-polarized, so I could hook it up either way, right?

The third purchase was a 4700 micrfarad electrolytic capacitor, 35WVDC
maximum, axial leads. as matt suggested-for $4.99 [so you were off by 99
cents matt ;)] This has an arrow, with what appears to be a negative sign in
the middle, on it. i was a little confused about your instructions for
hooking this up matt. you suggest &quot;Connect the positive lead to the wire
between the inverter and the radio and the negative lead to ground.&quot; that
sounds like three wires would need to come out of the capacitor. If I take
the power lead from the inverter-got to the capacitor positive, then hook
the capacitor negaive up tot he ground, where do i hook the radio up again?

thanks for all of your insight....
