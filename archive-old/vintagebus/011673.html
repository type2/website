     Okay, I admit it.  I watch Batman everynow and then.  Seems that  that campy 60's show from my childhood is packed with various VW's.  Batman and Robin are doing some serious hauling ass to catch the dreaded Egghead (Vicent Price).  Screaming thru the streets of Gotham City, but what is that behind them?  A bullet nose Bus, and it's right on their tail, and it stays there for blocks.  Could it be the secert BAT BUS??
  Peace, Love, and Robin--To the BAT BUS!!
