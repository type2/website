Greetings guys,

Your post got me hopping. I have been meaning to get an oil temp gauge on my
relatively new motor since it was completely new and as usual I have some
questions. 

The parts counter guy at the local VW flaps tells me that there are TWO
different oil temp sender units for Golf 1's(these are the only water cooled
VW's that I know that came to South Africa with small removable gauges that
weren't part of the main instrument cluster). They apparently operate in
different temp ranges. So I will need to take out the sender appropriate to
the gauge that I harvest. Where would I find this on a Golf 1?

Can the oil temp sender be tested like a water temp sender ie. by putting it
into a pot of boiling water to determine its accuracy round the water
boiling point? 

BTW harvesting a gauge and buying a new sender from the dealer(which has
gotta be the most expensive place)is still about a third of the price of a
new VDO kit.

TIA 

Michael
