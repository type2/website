Subject: RE:[VB] franklin mint bus for $10.00
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

Hello all,

My FM bus has been damaged a few times during moving and now it's more like a 
parts bus. I think it's still worth hanging on to. Never know, it could be 
the next rear loading Beach Bomb.
Luckily, I have a Franklin Mint store at the local mall and the manager let 
me part out the one they had on display. Theres looked like it had been 
dropped a few times as the cargo doors wouldn't shut, the axles were bent, 
and it had a few other structural problems. 

Have a good weekend everyone,
Dave Barnes
63 15-window
60 ragtop bug

Parts needed:
Passenger rear corner deluxe trim for the 15 window
Turquoise middle seat kick panel
