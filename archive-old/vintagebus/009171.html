Hi,

The numerals  10 9 reside at the top of the tag.     I guess
it was built on September 9. Is that correct?

I have the  big hatch, whew. Also the engine lid had the
articulating/locking arm until some big galoot at a service
station crushed the lid closed one time. Don't know about
any spring.

thanks,
Chris

 Hi,

  I believe the chassis number is 1164691. Found that on the
  plate in the engine compartment. Also found UF 2153 424280
  1164691 on the plate behind the front passenger seat.
There
  is also a sticker under that plate however it was painted
  over. I will unpaint it sometime and find out what it
says.


 sounds like an early 64 model- it does have the big hatch-
right?  what is
 the top line on the plate behind the front seat- that says
date of
 manufacture as day- month (not sure if you get year on
there too)

 do you have a spring on the engine compartment lid?
