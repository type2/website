You know it.   All the big hippy towns have large residual bus populations.
  I don't think I could name a single grateful dead song, but I've been
accused of being a deadhead more times than I can count.   I have seen a
lot of kiddies buy buses not for the sake of the bus, but because of the
ambience it added to their dope experience.

But we do have the hippies to thank for distributing buses all over the
place.  I'm not sure if any of them bought the buses new...
