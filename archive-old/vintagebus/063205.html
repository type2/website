Subject: Re: [VB] RE: rhino liner

I'm sure you'll be happy with it. But for applications like the floor of a
bus or sealing a surface that's out of sight, the epoxy material takes much
more abuse than the polyurethane. I've seen the polyurethane chip off, tear
off, or form air bubbles under it. But chances are you'll be ok. If I were
resurfacing the floor of my bus or the pan of a bug, I would use epoxy.
Line-X looks nice though.

&gt; Curious as I have recently put line-x in my truck. If you have time, why
&gt; none of the newer stuff?

&gt; My dad is in the Rhino Liner business. I've seen it since day 1. I would
&gt; steer clear of it.....if you want the really good stuff, get the old epoxy
&gt; spray-on bedliner. It's not as pretty, but it's much harder and longer
&gt; lasting. Ziebart should still carry it.
