You take 2 surface mount speakers and put the upside down on each end of the
parcel tray. This is a dead space area that even us big fatties don't use or
creep into.

***********
could you explain this a little more for me ....what is a surface mount
speaker? is that an exposed type of speaker, where you usually only see the
speaker grill, as opposed to one that comes enclosed? how exactly are the
attached at the underside of the parcel tray without changing the parcel tray?
