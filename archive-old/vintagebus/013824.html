To all you helpful vintagebus members out there,

I know this is probably asking for the impossible, but does anyone out there 
have a westy SO-35 interior they would be willing to sell?  I found a pretty 
straight '64 Kombi that used to be a flipseat westy.  The partition behind 
the front seat was not a walkthrough, but not a bench either.  I think I saw 
a post awhile back about flipseats that they were converted from bench seat 
kombi's.  The partition was cut, and it was not a hack job.  The bus also 
had a submarine hatch, and a mostly intact headliner. The westy interior is 
gone.  Tragic.  Another question, the tag from the engine bay reads:

23-35
1176847

I know that 23 means a kombi, but what is the -35?  Anyone out there had any 
experience &quot;re-creating&quot; westy interiors?  I wonder how hard it would be to 
rig up a flipseat for the front....  just thinking out loud.  Any help on a 
flipseat interior would be greatly appreciated.

TIA,

Mike Anderson

No bus as of yet....
