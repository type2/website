I have see two threads go by saying the archives are not working.  Anyone
care to detail this?

Other than some brief outages (10 minutes) due to some server work, they
have been up.  The search does have to be formatted correctly, perhaps this
is the problem?

Anyway, please drop me e-mail if you have any archive problems.
SGutknecht_at_i405_dot_com is my primary e-mail address.  I did not get a single
e-mail today relating to problems (hint hint).

Thanks.

P.S.  The archives are moving to a faster system and faster Internet
connection in the next 10 days if things keep on schedule.  Also upgrading
the software over the next 30 days too.  There will be some outages, most
under 30 minutes and not very frequent (2 or 3 a week)... so if you can't
get to them, try again a short time later.
