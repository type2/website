&lt;&lt; Next step, completely rebuild your sliding windows so water does not get
 there in the first place.

Hi Steve,
Well the only way to rebuild the front door windows so water does not flow
through them and still keep water from flowing inside the bus is to weld sheet
metal panels over the windows.  Since that is not a reasonably safe thing to
do to you driving visability we do not advise this.  Unfortunitly VW designed
all of thier VWs for some of the water from the front door window areas to
drain through the doors, except for possibly the Thing.    Eric &amp; Barb
