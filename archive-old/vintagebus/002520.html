Hey all, I'm missing the rubber bumper on the left side of the rear axle. It's that thing that apparently absorbs some extra shock from the shock absorbers. What are the replacements like? I don't see anywhere where you could just screw a new one on. Do these come with the steel attachment plate?...the one that's welded to the axle tube? How do you go about replacing it?

Thanks,
