&gt; I believe that the pitman arm in NOT supposed to be removed and reindexed.
&gt; Seems to me that the splines are sometimes made (on some cars) with one

I'm not sure, but i've had the arm off of my 66 before, and I do not
recall there being a flat spline.  But thats not the point of this
message.

&gt; I believe that the CORRECT way to center your wheel is to loosen all of the
&gt; tie rod end clamps and rotate the tie rods with a pipe wrench or similar
&gt; tool.  Each tie rod has a right-handed thread on one end, and a left-handed
&gt; thread on the other end, like a turnbuckle.  This means that turning the


No.

People, refer to your bus Bentley here.  

A bus, unlike most cars, has an additional linkage piece, called the drag
link, that is similar to a tie rod, and connects the pitman arm to the
swing lever.  this allows the steering box to be ahead of the rest of the
steering mechanism.


From the factory, the bus (at least, 63-79..before that I am not sure..but
i suspect it is the same.) came with only .one. adjustable tie rod.  the
other is a fixed length.

After correctly setting the toe-in (which does not require a centered
steering wheel, nor a centered box.  you can even do it with the drag link
disconnected..) drive the car forward a few feet, on a level smooth
surface, and stop using the parking brake (using the foot brake could
cause the bus to pull to one side, do to uneven front braking).  This also
assumes that your caster and camber are correct. (with caster correct, the
front end will self-center itself..)

Now, disconnect your drag link from the pitman arm. (the arm that is off
ofthe steering box).  crawl in the drivers seat, and find center of .your.
box.  Turn the wheel till it just hits full lock left, then count the
rotations to full lock right.  Do this a few times, back and forth, and be
sure you get the same numbers. You will likely have a fractional rotation
to deal with, as well.

Now take that number and divide it in half.  Say it took 6 1/2 turns
(random number) from lock to lock.  Go to lock, turn back 3 1/4 turns and
stop the wheel.  The spokes on the wheel should be ~ parallel with the
front seat.

Crawl under the bus, and unlock the locknut on the (one) adjustble end of
the drag link.  Now spin the drag link end in and/or out until it lines up
with the pitman arm as close as you can get. (it requires one full turn to
get the end to line up, so you may not get it exactly there..) get it as
close as you can.  While you are under there, you may wish to mark the
pitman arm/shaft/box with something so you have a future reference for
center.

You should be done.  reinstall the drag link end intot he pitmnan arm, and
drive across that flat level parking lot a few times...Does the wheel look
straight when you let it center itself, and when you are going straight?
great!  If not, double check your alignment, and readjust the drag link
whichever way you need to to get the spokes right.

On later buses (68+) the wheel/column shaft is splined and not keyed, so
you may have a wheel that is .not. centered with the box at all. (63-67,
at least, are not splined, they use a morris tapered shaft, and a woodruff
key)  So do the lock-to-lock checks, and find center..if your wheel is not
centered, continue on withthe rest, and if the bus runs straight ahead
after the drag link is adjusted, with the wheel int he same position that
you find with the lock-to-lcok test, go ahead and pull the wheel and
center it on the splines.


good luck.
