&gt;     But ever have a favorite wrench?   my favorite 13mm... forget the brand, 
&gt; but it has a distinctive V notch cut down into it.   It just feels nice

i have a favorite wrench.  it's an old heyco made for mercedes.  i like it because the handle angles outward and prevents me from cracking my knuckles on the crank pulley when i'm taking the generator nut off to adjust the fan belt tension.  it also feels good in my hand.  i got a set of hazet wrenches for christmas (along with a hazet tool box that's the bomb!) and they feel good in my hand also.  i think that maintenance and repair jobs on german cars are quicker, smoother and more successful when german tools are used.  as i add to my toolbox, i intend to add german tools, namely hazet.
