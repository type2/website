 &gt;If we had archives, I would tell you to go read my engine autopsy posts
 &gt;from last summer, but we don't, so here's the short version. I use
 &gt;Castrol Syntec 5W-50 and a Purolater filter and change both at 10,000
 &gt;miles. When my engine dropped a valve (my fault) and I had to rebuild
 &gt;it, I found so little wear on the parts in the bottom end it was
 &gt;amazing. I checked my bearing clearances with plastigage. I didn't find
 &gt;a single bearing worn out of the new engine specs. I could have reused
 &gt;my old rod bearings. The cam and lifters looked like new. &gt;&gt;

I dont know about the oil difference, but definately having an oil filter 
will improve and extend the life of the motor,  The bearings will last 
longer.  The rod bearings wont get those fleck marks , as the particles that 
caused them will be sucked up by the filter.
