&gt;&gt;  1 Oct 1964   215 036 379   All 1500s are 1-ton (Doliwa)
&gt;
&gt;So is this why my '65 &quot;1500&quot; Single Cab had 15&quot; wheels originally??

According to the data I have, yours &quot;should&quot; have had 14&quot; wheels from
the factory.  The last models to change over were apparently mid-model-year
1964 models, starting in late December 1963:
 
  5 Aug 1963     1 145 427   14&quot; tubeless tires for 1-ton models (Doliwa)
 19 Dec 1963     1 222 026   14&quot; tubless tires for 3/4-ton models (Doliwa)

From the Registry, you have a VIN of of 265 010 042 and a build date
of Aug 1964.  That number is consistent with the first part of August.
This is apparently well after the change-over to 14&quot; wheels.

On the other hand, maybe it was different for trucks as opposed to
the fully-enclosed bodies.  Not sure why that would be so but it
might account for it.  Remember, the books and lists are not always
100% accurate.
