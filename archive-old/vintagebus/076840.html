Subject: Re: [VB] RGB Gunk, brake backing plate

Ya when you pull that seal holder thing in the center off, gear oil will fall 
out.   The gl-4 I've found is staylube.   I use staylube 90 weight gl-4 gear 
oil in the gallon jug..    
Like veewee111 said, might as well drain the whole habitrail (tranny &amp; 
gearboxez) and after you're done putting new seals and stuff on refill w/ new seals 
at the stub axles.    Unless you recently changed the oil and it's all clean, 
that is

When removing the backing plates
from the parts bus, the center square plate-type thing
that covers what appears to be some sort of bearing
part of the RGB(??), A bunch of fluid starting pouring
out of here. I am assuming this is just gear oil from
the RGB, but I want to know how to deal with it before
I take the thing off of the good bus.  So, can I just
replace any fluid that runs out in the process at the
fill plug on top of the RGB. Do I use generic 90
weight gear oil in there or something else?
This is the first time I have dinked with the RGB's so
i am really pretty clueless.
