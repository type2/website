I can definitely say I don't miss the dust at BBB, much more comfortable, 
here behind the laptop on the sofa, watching the highlights of BJ on 
SPEEDVISION.

But where are all the Deluxes??

The only pic we have been able to find is of the mailbox. Although very cool, 
not something the neighborhood ASSociation would want to see in my driveway.

Come on guys, there got to be at least one!!!!
