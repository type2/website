&gt; just went to install it, got everything off and the studs that held the old 
&gt; pump on are 6mm and the bolts that came with the CB pump are 8mm. I have an 
&gt; H case in my 63 and am completely at a loss. I can only think of one solution 
&gt; and thats to take out the 6mm studs then drill and tap the holes to match 
&gt; the 8x1.25 bolts that came with this pump. 

hello Seth  There are three ways to solve this.  First see if there is a pump 
that has the 6mm stud holes.  second they make a stud that is 6mm on one side 
and 8 mm on the other,  you will have to look for these.  third  drill and 
tap to 8mm using an air blower or vac to rmove all of the shavings. Vw quit 
putting 6mm studs on the oil pumps after 1967 .  68 and 69 H cases had the 8 mm 
studs but they also had more problems with the  head studs pulling and cases 
cracking than the early H cases. I think they got the alloy mix too weak on those 
cases  later  Mark Dearing
