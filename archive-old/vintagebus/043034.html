&gt; bushings
&gt; for the reservoir base that push into the cylinder and a rebuild kit or
&gt; I need a
&gt; whole new master cylinder it bleeds like mad!  Can anyone help with a
&gt; company name that might make a rebuild kit or replacement!

Eric,

Wolfsburg West sells the 'bushings' (seals) and the last I saw, they did
have some of the master cylinders too. That was a while ago. 

Your (our) cylinder takes 22mm cups, just like the wheel cylinders. They
may NOT be the identical things though  - I DON'T vouch for that. If you
disassemble the MC, remove and compare carefully with any spare 22mm cups
you might have from front wheel cylinders. Might work. 

If your cylinder's bore (it's wall) is not corroded, you *may* be able to
carefully sand it down by hand using fine emery, or by using a cylinder
boring tool which attaches to your drill motor. 

there used to be MC rebuild kits for our 67 MC. I have one from 12 years
ago, still unused. Sorry, it's part of my spares. It consists of new
rubber cups and small hardwares and clips,etc. 

If you replace the cups in the MC, be sure to properly orient their flared
end exactly as the parts you removed. 

clean everything up with alcohol when done. Internals must be
*immaculately* clean. You can then lube it for reassembly using clean
brake fluid.

PS: If WW doesn't have what you need, ask them where, or try Ron Salmon
here on the list (Busdepot_dot_com).
