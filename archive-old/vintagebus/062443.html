Subject: RE: [VB] Single wheel trailer Q's

Damn, wish I had a FLAPS around here. 

I'm still struggling to come up with a shock for my slam-o-matic that is
short enough. All the local stores keep asking for an application. I
take the bug lowering shocks with me and say &quot;I need something about 2
in shorter than this&quot; and they ask &quot;what's it for&quot;. I'm really tempted
to tell them &quot;Your mom&quot; but know that won't go anywhere good. The
concept of digging through a few boxes is _completely_ alien to anyone
and the standard bus shock is (obviously) about 16&quot;. Grrr...

Frustrated, but still looking. Anybody know if old Mini shocks are very
short?

Take the ones you have out and take them to your FLAPS on a slow day.
They can probably fix you up with some that will work.  Just have them
look in their paper bearing catalog - the trailer won't be listed in
their computer.
