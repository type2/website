  1.  &quot;Rear Cargo Hatch Seal, 64-71 Bus    I haven't found it for less
than $90&quot;

You can actually buy them Cheaper in England  even with postage.  I have
used them and they are great--Find a &quot;Volksworld&quot; magazine for details--also
try a bone yard and you can use an old one--If the climate was kind --
