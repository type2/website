&gt; There were some pin head sized shavings stuck to the magnetic plugs, 
&gt; but nothing big and chunky looking.  The more i've tinkered with this, 
&gt; it really seems like fourth is not getting fully engaged.  I've also, 
&gt; since the post, had a similar, but much smaller incident getting into 
&gt; 2nd.  Is there any other way to test all four gears without driving 
&gt; around and stopping to adjust the shift plate?   (That's the wishful 
&gt; thinking question)
&gt; 
&gt; If indeed just 4th is shot, what would you recommend I do with this 
&gt; tranny?  Is the whole tranny now a lost cause?
&gt; 
&gt; Again, thanks for your help and honest opinions

Hi Don,
Sounds like you might need to slide the shifter slight forward to engage 
second and fourth farther.  Driving is the only real way to test a tranny.
Glad we could help,
Eric&amp;Barb
