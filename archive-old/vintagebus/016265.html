Subject: [VB] No oil pressure

I finally made it out to Bremerton, WA two months ago, but ended up with the 
oil pressure dummy light coming on.  I hooked up VDO oil pressure &amp; temp. 
guages, and found that after first starting up when cold, pressure is 40psi. 
  Once temp. reaches 120, pressure drops to less than 20psi when driving, 
and a hare above 0psi when idling.  I checked the oil pump for wear, play in 
the crankshaft for worn bearings, tried a thicker oil, cleaned the screen, 
and checked for leaks.  None of these seems to be a problem.  Oil temp. 
stabilizes at 180F.  Any ideas?  Happy driving--Chet

A bus is a lot like a good dog: it's always there for you, constantly 
demands attention, and always with on camping trips.  My bus doesn't leak 
oil either- she's just marking her territory.
