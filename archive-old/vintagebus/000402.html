Hi Steven,
As in one side of the bulb connected to the positive output of the regulator 
and the other side connected to the idiot light connection.  It will not work 
quite like it would in the bus.  When you first start the engine the light 
will come on and go off when the generator gets up to speed.  Then when 
shuting it down will flicker just a bit then turn off without battery being 
connected to the positive side of the regulator. 
  You are welcome,   Eric&amp;Barb
