Lou, Super neat bus, First one i've seen as a standard dd , Barry has a DD 
bench Kombi, He's driving it to Jerome with me driving my 62 DD panel.
I hope your driving it to Jerome so I can check it out. 
Rare middle seat for damn sure.

&lt;&lt;  HI Volks,
 A friend of mine Tom here in Havasu just bought a '63 DD Standard Microbus.
 It's 'very' complete, inside &amp; out.  I posted a pic on my web page, sorry
 for the slow loading page I'm just learning how to 'thumb' pics.
