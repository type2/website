Subject: Re: Nothing to winch to (correct subject)

A shovel and a friend to hold it will get you out of many 'no anchor' 
situations.

Push shovel as deep as you can facing stuck item.  Put strap as low on 
the handle as you can.  Have friend hold handle, pulling away from 
stuck item.  Winch slowly.

I've unstuck 6k lb. Chevy Suburbans using the technique.  The key is 
work gentle.

&gt; forget how long it was to also have a metal pole and
&gt; driver you can set in the ground and pull against so
&gt; when there are no trees you can still come along your
&gt; self out.  good idea if you spend a lot of time in
&gt; isolated areas cuz even if you can make cell signal
&gt; calls to 911 sometimes they aren't clever enough to
&gt; find you.  
&gt; i watched the search plane fly over me but they never
&gt; got to me on the ground.  come a long didn't help in
&gt; that situation.....
