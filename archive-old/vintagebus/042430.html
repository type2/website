&gt; Man, you're not kidding.  I wore it on my hands and forearms (latex gloves, 
&gt; which I doubled, ripped) for about ten days.  I had to answer all sorts of 
&gt; questions in that time.  (Also, it might be nice to wear a faceshield, 
&gt; goggles still let it get on your forehead.)
My under the car por15 outfit:

coveralls

rubber gloves that are for chemical work.  they are thick and go up to
past your forearms... keep you from getting a gap between your glove and
coveralls. (i think i spent $2 on a pair from home depot, have used em 6-8
times, and they are still in good condition.  Dishwashing gloves are
pretty much the smae thing, but are usually pink, heh)

Spraying sock.  This you can get at good auto body stores.  It covers your
head like a ski mask but has a big enough face opening to allow a
respirator in.  its also thin enough not to overheat you.

goggles/facemask

If i happen to get any on my body that i dont want there, i try to wipe
off with a rag SOON.  If it wont come off, i use a tad bit of lacquer
thinner on a rag and rub it off my skin.  I have been told that lacquer
thinner on skin is a really bad idea, so take this FWIW.  it might be
better to wear that black, dunno.  If you wait too long nothing will get
it off.

most people that drip paint a lot when brushing, the drips come from right
by the ferrule from having the brush too overloaded with paint at the end
closest to the handle.

How to avoid this:  Clean off the brush on the inside of the paintcup
until all the paint is more or less unloaded from the bristles, (dont just
mess around, mush the bristles so that they go 90 degree angle to the
ferrule)  then just load up like the tips of the bristles (maybe last 1/2
or so.. you will get a feel for it...) then work the brush back and forth
to get complete coverage. If you find you have to go back to the cup too
often, get a bigger brush! (or as you get a feel for it you can load it up
a bit more...)

FYI, foam brushes stink, spend the extra $0.50 and get a disposable
bristle one. the one time i por-15ed with a foam brush i made the biggest
mess.  you just cant control those like a real brush.

peas,

Steve
