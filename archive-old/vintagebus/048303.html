My 57 owners manual says 2.0 liters for the center and 0.25 liters in each 
reduction box.
Not sure if its the same for youre bus or?

&lt;&lt; Ok the manuals are in the mail but the tranny is drained and we want to
hit the road tomorrow so.....  Help!!!

Can we fill from center only or do we have to fill each RGB seperately?
The bus is on a hoist so the wheels are hanging down.

How much total to fill including RGB and tranny?  Would like to know
when we are getting close.

Appreciate any help
