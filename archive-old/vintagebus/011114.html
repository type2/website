&lt;&lt; how can i get gland nut loose without an impact wrench?
  &gt;&gt;

Well first off you'll need a flywheel (sold at most FLAPS ) to keep the 
flywheel from turning while your straining your guts at the end of a long 
cheater pipe. The pipe will need to have a large enough diameter to it over 
your breaker bar. I use a 6. foot section of fence pipe. Then you'll need 
some means of securing the engine so it doesn't move. I've heard of all kinds 
of things, to include chaining it down to anchor bolts embedded in the 
driveway. I usually get a few friends to stand on one end.
 Lately I haven't had to deal with that method though. I bought a torque 
meister from KYMCO , which converts torque through gears.They advertise being 
able to apply 30 lb torque and convert it to near 300. Its really the way to 
go and no staining oyur guts out.
