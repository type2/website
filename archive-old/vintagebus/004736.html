    It might be a relief valve... when fuel pump output pressure reaches a
preset amount, a valve is lifted off of its seat and allows fuel to flow
back to the fuel pump inlet line...?
    that *could* be tested... ;)
    quite possible that it was an earlier fix for the mysterious exploding
fuel filter (twixt the pump &amp; carb...) problem. ??? who knows...
