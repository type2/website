Subject: Re: [VB] king pins

  I would just get a set of rebuilt spindles from www.bus-boys_dot_com. A lot cheaper then buying the kit and a lot less labor on your part. They usually have them in stock ready to ship on an exchange basis.

Hi Jason,
Yes, but did you notice that the steel needle bearings are not in that kit! 
This is a Brazilian bus kit and has brass bushings instead....
