Subject: Re: [VB] doglegs

oh, no, chopping up a corner window bus for metal.  Is it that one in the 
junkjard near you that needs TLC but is definately restorable?

Don't do it, man, don't do it.

 Okay folks... Let's just suppose that I found a '59 or so 19 window. 
 Let's further suppose that there's *no* rust in the doglegs.  Supposing 
 that someone wanted such a thing, where would one cut to remove them? 
 And, what would a fair price be for them?  (Rust free, passenger side a 
 bit bent at the rear...)
