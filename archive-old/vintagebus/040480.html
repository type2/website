You would think that ALL WalMarts would have the same price, but they dont. 
The ONLY things that are the same price are what you see in the flyers that 
they put out. Prices are dictated by location and WHO they are in compition 
with in that area.

How do I know....I worked for them for 7 years. Why dont I still work for 
them...thats another story. I learned a lot about retail and there is a lot 
I wish I hadnt learned.

Here in Florida, I have been paying 12.97 for the bus/bug setup.

&gt;Dear List,
&gt;I purchased the bus/bug/trailer combo at a Western Michigan Wal-mart,
&gt;and paid $17.95 for it.  I had mentioned to another list member about
&gt;the great range in pricing in different parts of the country.
&gt;Has anyone else paid this much?
