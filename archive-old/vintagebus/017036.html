The other problem with the restos is that they tend to lose the 
crispness of the original molding due to the wear on the original wheel and
the subsequent sanding to clean it up.  I was going to buy a Koch-restored
wheel, but when I actually looked at the one he had available, I
declined.  The little ribs across the arms were almost nonexistant, and
the ridges on the back were uneven and very worn.  While it was
very shiny, it just looked really worn up close.  *And* they wanted $200,
not including horn button!

I think it's more cost-effective to buy one of Chris's wheels, which is literally
akin to buying a new wheel, and the only &quot;old&quot; part is the metal center.
Dont' get me wrong, Koch's does a great jobs on their wheels - I have a barndoor
deluxe wheel that they did that is absolutely beautiful, but they can only do 
so much with a crappy starter wheel.  I got lucky with the deluxe wheel
in that they had a nice wheel to start with.

This is one of those rare cases where a repro part is as good as the original.
Put me down for one!

&gt; Essentially he breaks them down to the cores and puts them into a mold
&gt; which he fills with the correct plastic. Doing a resto on a steering wheel
&gt; will look great for awhile, longer if your bus is a garage-kept trailer
&gt; queen....but it won't last forever. Well, these probably won't last FOREVER
&gt; either, but they'll last a lot longer if you actually use your bus.
