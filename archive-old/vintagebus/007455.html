Subject: Re: [VB] First time non-greeting from ACVW

&gt;  Did you actually wave, or did you flash a peace sign?
&gt; Do you have a peace sign painted on your bus or maybe
&gt; flowers painted around your headlights? Any and all of
&gt; that will most likely make me turn my head and act
&gt; like I didn't see you when I am on the road.


Hey, hey, HEY!

Show a little respect for those of us who have actually been driving splits
since &quot;those days&quot; and are not ashamed of it.
I have always showered and washed my (long) hair daily, not to mention being
productively employed.

Peace is not a dirty word.
