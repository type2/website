Subject: Re: [VB] help for the new old guy

I think an AE case is a '71 but I'm not sure either. I'd pull all the top end stuff of and give it a good cleaning, change the oil, clean out the carb, re-check all timing and valve settings and see if you can get it started. 
When you drain the oil check for metal traces and/or shavings. Let's see some pics!
