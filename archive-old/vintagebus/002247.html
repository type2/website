Just a note to everyone that I'm planning on pairing up with Dan Buser in
Cameron, MO Thursday/Friday and we're going to campout at some KOA around
Springfield.  I'd like to meet up with Bob Hufford (the only name that comes
to mind from down there) and any other listees who are planning to attend.
Just look for a big guy in overalls.  We won't be driving a VW (as last year
the heat damn near killed me and Li'l Red) but as restitution, I will be
bringing my guitar as a distraction.  This way if I'm asked where Li'l Red
is, I can just burst out in song and pretend to be drunk or something so as
to avoid answering. :-)

Hope to see you there.

Erin
