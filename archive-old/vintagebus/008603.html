As a result of a very nice phone chat with Bill this morning on the phone,
we worked very close together to find the EXACT location of the campout on
www.mapquest_dot_com

Go to the online directions at
http://home.ispi_dot_net/~elassley.bie/bnnta/bnnta.htm and read the directions
before clicking on the link.
I did a little custom work on the map so I hope you pass this info around to
those who wish to make it to the campsite.

The original URL was a ball park online atlas of the nearest town of Monroe,
MO which is where the red star is still located.  You want to follow the
little blue push-pin for your directions.  Enjoy!
