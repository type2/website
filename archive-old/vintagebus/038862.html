I don't think it has anything to do with the the engine parts / cleaning and
so on.
Someone there told me that it could be the lead in the fuel.
Unleaded engine gets hotter then lead engines.
I had to put lead into the fuel, when I drive in Germany (only sell unleaded
fuel) and maybe I did't put enough (I just mean that I put enough).

Is't better to put a little to much lead into the fuel,than to less ?
