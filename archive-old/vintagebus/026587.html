&gt; Hi Boyd,
&gt; The Sapphire III &amp; IV were for the 1966-67 VWs.  The dealerships would
&gt; install a resistor for the 6 volt models to install into the 12 volt VWs
&gt; until the 6 volt stocks were used up.   Eric&amp;Barb

That's strange.  The one that I'm looking at right now is a Sapphire V. I guess
this one would be late...except the bus is an early 67...oh well.  It is an AM
only and is 12V.  It is most definitely original to the '67 hard top Westfalia
I removed it from which is in the drive.  The radio looks like most of its
other cousins in the Sapphire line.  Two knobs that are black with dished
chrome centers.  Left one is on/off and volume as well as a secondary tone
control behind the primary knob.  Right one is station selection only.  There
are five preset push buttons that are chrome plated plastic.  The face plate is
cast metal and is chrome with black crinkle finish on the flat inner parts.
There are two protrusions that are on the ends of the face plate that stick out
about .5 inches.  They are part of the casting. Seeing that the 67 radio hole
is a one year only, I figure this is a special one year face plate too...not
sure though.

There are 4 wires exiting the chassis.  Two speaker (brown) and a positive 12V
and a ground.  One is blue and the other one is green (not sure which is
which).  There is also an antenna port in the rear of the chassis and directly
below it is the antenna trim above 1400 kc (kilo cycles) screw

There is a ID number stamped on the top and bottom.  Not sure if it is a
specific to this radio serial number.  The number is 15D43170A04.  Also
engraved on the top of the radio is this text &quot;Designed and built exclusively
for Volkswagen distributors in the United States of America&quot;

That's about it.  This one came out and one of the Radio Shack ones went in
because this one needs a tune up and I wanted some FM.  BTW for 35 bucks the RS
radio is an easy fit and works great....no cutting required.

Anyone have a speaker bracket they'd like to sell or have the dimensions to
build one????

Steve
