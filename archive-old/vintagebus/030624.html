Knowing Brian (I do). He'll probably make his Single into some water proof
sub-like thing. Make some type of air recycler out of old O.J. cans to
circulate the exhaust back into the carb. Mount up his trusty snow chains, put
on an air tank an drive his Bus down there to see it!!!

That guy ain't right!! That's why I like him..................
