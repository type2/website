Subject: Re: [VB] Members in Atlanta area coming out west?

Without knowing all the details of your situation, I would like to suggest that he ship it through
Greyhound, or similar.  Greyhound is cheap and has delivered everything that I've sent/received
through them safely.

Why would he accept your purchase if he doesn't plan on shipping it?  Again, I don't know all of
the details, here, but if it was purchased through Ebay or similar there are ways to get your
cooler to you.

best of luck,
T

&gt; I recently purchased a *large* Coca-Cola cooler from a guy in Atlanta
&gt; for a song. Unfortunately, he will not ship and has asked that I have it
&gt; picked up. On the off chance that there are members in that area that
&gt; might be travelling out toward Cali, I wanted to see if there was a
&gt; chance I could &quot;hitch a lift&quot;. Halfway is fine too, I just want to get
&gt; it moving from where it's at now.
