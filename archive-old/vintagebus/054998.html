&lt;&lt; Does the &quot;local manufacture&quot; only cover tools that are supposed to fabbed 
locally via a pattern (as the name would imply),&gt;&gt;

Hi Michael,
Yes.

&lt;&lt; or does it cover all those crazy items that pieslinger (sp?), matra, 
gedore etc. made specifically for vw over the years? &gt;&gt;

For that info you need the Sonderwerkzeuge or Special Service tools catalog.  
Our 1964 copy was supplimented up into the 70s, but even though it is stuffed 
full of pages of this info, it is still incomplete!   Eric&amp;Barb
