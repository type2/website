Subject: Shifter rod boot on tranny?

Hi,

Is there a boot or something on the tranny shift rod?

This is the thing sticking out the front of the tranny
that goes to the shift coupler.

My old tranny didn't have one, but the older tranny
I'm putting (why would I freak if I said sonething
like this about my now departed Honda, but its ok for
my bus?!?!) seems suspicously clean in this area, as
if protected by a boot.  I have a spare boot that goes
from the frame member to the sifter linkage on the
front side of the coupler which doesn't fit on the
tranny, but could me made to work...

Thanks for any tips,
...Markus
