Subject: re:soundproofing

Sounds to me like you guys are talking about the stuff called &quot;ice and water
shield&quot;. I think that is the name, it is basically a dense rubbery type
material, that is peel and stick. It is very sticky. I imagine this would
work well in a bus for soundproofing.

I think you need to determine a few things first:

Where is the noise coming from? 
-engine
-wheels
-transmission
-wind
-road
-other?

What type of noise is it?
-high pitch (treble)
-low pitch (bass)

Based on the answers to these, you should be able to determine which type of
insulation you want to use, and where to put it.

I'm not a sound engineer-but I believe for the low end of the 'sound
spectrum' you want more mass(think dynamat, or lead), to absorb sound. For
the higher end you just need a break(think pink fiberglass).

Hope that helps.

If you go to mcmaster_dot_com, they used to have a pretty good section
explaining sound attenuation(not sure if it is still there), and the correct
materials to use and where to use them. Not specifically for vehicles, but
for sound in general.
