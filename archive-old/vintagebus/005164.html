&gt;&gt;long these same lines, has anyone used the 3 point dolly approach?  This
entails making a single caster dolly that mounts to the tranny horns in
back(with about a 1 foot extension between the mounting angle iron and the
caster).  In front, basically the same caster approach, except that a plate
is bolted to the front beam frame locations (one for each side)and it (the
plate) is welded to a notched pipe or square tube that is welded or bolted
to the large caster.

We thought of this but I wanted good access to the front beam area and I
might still have it on these jacks when I go and mount the tranny (but not
40&quot; in the air).  Also it would be hard to raise and lower it via some form
of jack... wouldn't you need to get it up there somehow and then bolt it in
place?
