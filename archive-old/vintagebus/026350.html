If you say something is for sale, give a price, and advertise it as
such, I believe you are morally obliged to sell it when someone meets
the offer. As long as it isnt a scrap dealer, I don't see how it matters
that it is going to Japan. It is a Euro Westy, so when it came to
America it had already left it's original market destination. The folks
in Japan who are shelling out the Big Yen for buses will in all
likelihood take good care of them.

Putting a bus up for sale then not wanting to sell it when someone takes
you up on it is, in my mind, akin to the folks who put out all their
neat stuff at the swaps not to sell, but just to show that they have it,
and be cool. If it aint for sale, don't put the for sale sign up.
