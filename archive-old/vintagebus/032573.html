since we're on the subject.  DON'T BUY REPRO HUBCAP CLIPS!! they don't have
the same contour as originals, causing either a very poor fit, or easy
breakage (all that work for nothing).  you can go to the DEALER and order
original, german ones-part numbers :  111-601-131 (clip), and N 13 407 1
(rivet--may be &quot;013&quot;, have them look on the microfische on like a '70 bus
or mid 60's bug--THEIR SYSTEM DOES NOT HAVE LISTINGS FOR SPLITTY BUSSES!,
unless they have and old fische machine gathering dust and a splitty card.)
the prices are cheap, about $1.10 each (clip/rivet), which isn't much more
or depending who you get them from, cheaper than the junk repro ones. 
plus, if you're patient, you won't have to pay shipping and you'll have og
stuff.
