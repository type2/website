Subject: Looking for vent window frames
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

A friend of mine has had no luck in locating some rust free vent window 
frames locally for his 60 DD Panel. Anybody have some they could part with? 
Don't need the glass but it would be nice. Will take complete top section too.
Let me know,

Thanks,
Brian
