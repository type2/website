Subject: Fixing Oil Leak

Is there any way to stop oil seepage from the seam between the case halves?
I have a 1600DP which I had out, stripped down and retorqued, and thoroughly
cleaned of its oil and gunk coating.

There was no trace of leakage at the pushrod tubes, the valve covers, the
doghouse oil cooler or the flywheel seal. It just seems to seep out of the
seam on the bottom surface between the case halves, near the front (FIF) of
the engine and just behind the sump filter plate.

Is there anything that can be applied to this seam to stop the seepage, or
am I just going to have to live with it and keep the drip pan under the bus
in the garage? The case nuts are already torqued up to the spec. Any help
appreciated!
