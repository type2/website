I've always thought that asking permission to link was kind of a way of
begging to be linked :-)  I don't think it's _necessary_ to ask before
placing a link to someone's site unless they say so on their page (some
people do).  It's a courtesy thing, I guess...for me though, I rarely tell
(not ask ;-)) people they're linked, mostly because I'm sure they have
better things to do than read &quot;Hey, can I link your site?&quot;  It also keeps me
from being on &quot;you scratch my back, I'll scratch yours&quot; link lists.  Just
one dude's opinion...you don't have to ask me :-)  Of course, like most
webmasters(?) I enjoy receiving comments about the site, and if there's a
mention about a link in there it doesn't bother me one bit!

I have a lot of buses on my site!  (bus content)
