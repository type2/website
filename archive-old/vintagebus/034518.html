Are spindles rebuildable or do you just replace them. A friend of mine just

they are rebuildable, but it isn't simple.    directions in your bentley.   
You can get rebuildt ones from Wolfgang in Redding, I have and they were 
good.   But you'll eat the  not insignificant core charge.  What year is your 
bus?

Now I am trying to figure how the bearing messed it up that bad, where the 
inside of the the inner bit goes on the bearing , it should not even wear 
there.  Is the kingpin good ?
