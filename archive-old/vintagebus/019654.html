For any type of rust preventative, you *really* need to get the paint out
of the way.  You don't put a band-aid on over your shirt, do you?

&gt; I have noticed/read that POR-15 doesn't like to go over paint. Is coorless

&gt; entire (sanded to 80) floor and the cleaned up rust (probably baremetal
&gt; spots) with one product, then paint to stock. Is POR or cooroless a better
&gt; choice?
