Oop's the last list was for newie bus wrong one I got the right one this
time I think.
let me start again got the answers to my q's in the other lists though haha


    My name is Charles and im a vw addict! I have owned 3 vws first two were
bugs 65' &amp; 59'
my last one (probably not my last) I just got a 63' panel  bus. It is in
half way good shape I paid 400.00 for it (that is why I have it, it was a
good deal) it runs I received no keys with it, the back door was locked and
the engine was lock with no handle(and the lock was broke could not get the
door open I did though I need some new hinges anyone!) there is some rust
through out the whole thing nothing to bad though. might have to replace by
feet though! I live in California, Dublin that is.
there is a show in Vallejo this weekend I believe, just a reminder.

hope I can help anyone with the knowledge that I
have it has been awhile since my brain has been on vws but it still has
something's in it .
