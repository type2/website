I just posted some pictures on ebay of some really cool hemp seatcovers and
jack bags that my wife and i are making, if any one on the list is
interested, here are the links.  i can do the jack bag for $20 delivered to
any list members, email me if you are interested, the seat covers are $60
delivered.  They are both very nice and washable.  The seat covers go over
the existing vinyl and are held nicely in place with snapes and elastic, to
protect you investment .  The jack bag has front pockets to hold all the
jack tools and is lined with corduroy , it is really nice.

We are working on a full line, we will have 1/3 2/3 soon, we also do late
model westphalia stuff, OF course all the money is going right back into our
vws, :o), Ive been making door panels that are covered with hemp fabric and
i will post pictures soon .

CHeck this out:

They make a corrugated plastic/vinyl  that comes in 4by8 sheets, they
usually have it at art stores for $10-20 a sheet, its like a cardboard box
material, but its plastic,anyway it comes in a lot of colors, perfect for
kick panels if you need them.
if you cut it just a little big it fits nice and snug without screws!
Imagine that kick panels for $10?
its lighter than the wood stuff and its easier to cut.Use a sharp razor
blade and go slow and then you can shave off the extra for a perfect fit.
Also you can cover it with material for door panels etc and save alot of
cabbage!
