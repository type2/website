   I would sell all 7 of my vws for $50,000 and then buy a
 real &quot;barndoor bus&quot;.  Now I'd buy a 1971 barndoor single
 cab, (split windshield right?), pickup with the double
 opening barndoors on both sides but they have to be  the BIG doors!  I just love the big engine lid on barndoor
 pickups!
