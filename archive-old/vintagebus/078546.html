Subject: [VB] Re: [T2] RE: [VB]fuel sys mod

&gt;Okay. Noticed last night my late baywindow doesn't have a threaded 
&gt;tap. Just welded (?) to the bottom of the tank. Short rubber hose to 
&gt;the valve?
&gt;Ciao!

hmmmmmm - mine had a small fitting which the nipple was ATTACHED to. 
actually, passed through, but the point is that there was a piece you 
could screw off, replace that nipple with the BD fuel tap.  possible 
that vw went to something else later; karl, you da king, did they 
change this?
