Was writ..
&gt; Driving habits have changed.  I see messages every week about people going
&gt; on cross country trips in their bus... and we joke about 50MPH &quot;just pass&quot;
&gt; but there are a lot of people out there wanting to go 65MPH so they can at
&gt; least keep up with the 18 wheel trucks!

Stephen et al,
    If you are a restorer then you are stuck with it, at 55 you will go. I
felt endangered almost always in modern traffic and did the following to my
66:
Kept the nice tight 1600, put a doghouse cooler and a mechanical advance
distributor on, spent money on decent extractors,then (all restorers forgive
me) took out the running gear and replaced it with type 3 Station wagon
complete.
Now I have IRS 14&quot; wheels and a top speed of around 70 something MPH  (no
tach yet)
I Love it . It goes, it handles and with the 1970ish bolt in disc brake
front end it stops too.The old hubcaps fit and I can still climb the kerb if
need be without tearing the underneath.
Saving up bux to get it painted and de-rusted next. Heaven.
    Barry Wright
