Subject: misplaced engine list post

Hey list.  Did any one save that superb breakdown of
engines available for type2s and their hp ratings?  I
would like you to send it to me for future knowledge. 
For those of you on the list who take the effort to
look up parts numbers and prodution dates, thank you. 
For those of us without libraries you are an
irreplaceable help.
