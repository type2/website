Message-ID: &lt;370b6b38Why is Backfiring (Timing...stiff Engine)*_at_m400gw.wiley_dot_com&gt;

&gt; on reassembly, my dizzy drive shaft notch didn't line up like the books say
at TDC.  It was off by
&gt;about 20degrees counterclockwise.  I've tried puzzling out the geometry in
my head and it *seems*
&gt;like this is not a problem,

It's not necessarily a problem, in my opinion.

&gt; but to get timing right at present, the notch on the dizzy rim points sorta
towards #1 cyl.  But it's the relationship
&gt;between dizzy cam and #1 plug wire that matters, right?

Bring the motor to  TDC for #1 by looking at the #3 valves or with coat
hanger in the #1 hole, or by whatever method
you use. Now look where your rotor is pointing - that's your number one. Now
swing your
distributor notch around counterclockwise until it lines up with the rotor,
maybe just before it. Now when you put your cap
on, your number one wire should go on the hole above the rotor &amp; notch, no
matter where on the clock your rotor and notch
are, thats where your number one goes. everything else will fall into place
around that. Time is statically per Muir, when the
test light winks on, tighten your distributor clamp.

&gt;starter will barely spin it -- and it's not the starter; I can barely turn
it with a crescent wrench on the
&gt;crank pulley bolt.

Remove the plugs, tighten the fan belt and spin the motor with a spark plug
socket on the gen pulley. Do you hear loud
hissing noises that indicate real good compression? Do you hear metallic
noises? You might want to squirt a tiny bit of oil
into the spark plug holes and keep spining - but only if you suspect the
pistons and rings are dry from the motor sitting rebuilt
but unused through a winter or something.
