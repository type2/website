Ted,

Thanks - I got a reply saying the same thing earlier. About 9 years ago,
when my bus was new (to me) I accidentally reversed the wires to the front
left headlight and melted the jacked off all the wires in the area.  In my
haste to repair it, I wrapped all the bare wires (that I could see) with
electrical tape, and she's worked ever since (until now). So I bet a new
short has developed somewhere deep down in the left corner  - I'll replace
the wires in that area and hopefully be on my way!

BTW, I agree - it can't get much simpler than the old VW electrical system.
And Thom's diagrams are great.

With all the fuses pulled the dash lights still work and the starter trigger
wire will still have power if you turn the key.If you look at the wiring
charts on Thom's page you will see that the ignition switch and light switch
are NOT connected to a fuse,they connect to the hot side of the fuse
block,so there may well be some parasitic draw from these two switches as
well as the clock if you have a delux.Also the front park lights are unfused
off the switch so look close and long before you start hacking a good
harness.The VW wiring is a piece of cake to work on compared to lets say a
late model F*RD or a vehicle with LUCAS electrics.LOOK at Thom's wiring
charts they work and you can run down to Kinko's with it on a disk have it
printed,laminated in the size of your choice.

Ok, my test meter doesn't read amps, so I'm going by the sparking method
(carefully). The problem is, even with all fuses removed, I still get the
spark at the ground strap. The only way I've found to get rid of the spark
is by disconnecting the wire that runs from the starter to the front of the
bus (disconnect at the starter end). That's as far as I've got on this -
that wire looks about as hard to replace as the whole harness, so this may
be the route I take.

Thanks,
Wilder
