I saw a Mexican watercooled bus on I35 in the Austin, Tx area a week or so
ago. It caught my attention as we drove up behind it. I was thinking &quot;man,
that's a nice looking loaf.&quot; As I got closer I noticed the mexican plates.
Sure enough as I got to the front...radiator. Pretty strange looking. Wish
I'd had my camara handy. 

Also saw on TV one day  when I was home sick that &quot;David&quot; from &quot;Eight is
Enough&quot; drives a spit-window camper.
