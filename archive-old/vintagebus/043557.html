&gt;no, but I do have this small stud DP motor that I think is out of some late 
&gt;bug and there is no road draft tube. 
&gt;not only that, but the breather tube off the oil filler is much bigger.   
&gt;And the intake manifold has this thing pointing out towards the back of the 
&gt;motor (crank pulley side).  then this other thing bolts to it with two 10mm 
&gt;headed long bolts.  and a tube from that goes down to the left side of the 
&gt;tin, another junction and it runs underneath where at some point someone 
&gt;pinched it off.  what the hesshus is that?

I bet you a nickel it's an AH code engine.  My dad has one like that in
his '74 Bug, it's original.  The bigger breather tube goes with the
paper-element air filter and plastic housing that was used on those
cars.  The extra plumbing on the intake manifold is EGR, exhaust gas
recirculation.  Stock, there is a threaded fitting on the left side
muffler flange.  A filter screws into this.  A metal tube screws into
the other side of the filter, and runs up through the tin to the EGR
valve.  There is a small vacuum hose from the top of the EGR valve
to a port that sticks out of the carb (34-PICT-3) to the rear and 
about 30 degrees above horizontal.  The EGR valve has a square metal
base that bolts on to the manifold and a round top.  If you want
to get rid of it, just make sure you cap off the fitting on the carb,
and that it doesn't leak.  If it does leak, take it off the manifold
and you will see the two bolt holes with a bigger hole in the center
that goes into the intake manifold.  Make yourself a little cover
plate to fit over this, put some RTV on it, bolt it down with
shorter bolts, and there you go.

&gt;And then it has this alternator that has 4 yes FOUR places to plug 
&gt;in?  what can I do with that?  looks like it needs an external
&gt;regulator or something- says VW and has the Motorola symbol on it
&gt;and says made in the USA.

My Dad's Bug has one of these too.  The regulator is under the
back seat.  Stock, all the terminals are in a big round plastic
plug that fits onto the top of the alternator.  Look at
http://www.vintagebus_dot_com/wiring/bug-74+75-a.jpg
Three of the connections go to the regulator - one is also the
dash light connection.  The other connection goes to the battery.
You can probably make it work if you can find the late regulator
to go with it.

Let me know if you need more info and I'll try to borrow my Dad's
Bentley for his Bug and get a better wiring diagram.
