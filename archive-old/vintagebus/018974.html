Here are the regulations for importation of a
non-native vehicle into the main 48 States of the USA.
Thought that it would be valuable for someone's info
archive. This was mentioned on another email list. 

Yeahbutt clause: I have not had my lawyer glean it for
Clara-fications or +yeah but+ aspects that others may
raise. Deal with it as you see fit. I didn't go
through a registered import agent when I dragged in
the 54 Bus. The info is important for vehicles less
than 26 years old (25 years to current).

Yeah butt- my second Stepdad's third wife's secret
metaphysical new age lesbo-channeling girlfriends's
three legged dog sort of knew someone who thought that
he heard that you could do &lt;whatever&gt; so your are
wrong, man!
