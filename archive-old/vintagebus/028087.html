Well, I bought a new 1972 bus. I went in to a dealer
(out of town), and said I want this! pointing to a picture
in a brochure. When can I have it here? He said three
weeks, I said OK, arranged the financing and left!
That was IT!!

&gt; I recently went and bought a 2000 jett_at_ at the VW dealership. While I was
&gt; test driving, I approached a speed bump .&quot;SPEED UP!!&quot; yelled the salesman.&quot;
&gt; FASTER! FASTER!!!!!&quot; I hit the bump goin about 50, barely phased the car.
&gt; &quot;Hahaha, nice eh?&quot; he said.
&gt; The sales guy then tells me to stop in a parking lot. He gets out and climbs
&gt; up on the open door. he then starts jumping up and down as hard as he can
&gt; with all his weight on the door and says &quot;look! doors wont sag or break!
&gt; welded hinges!!&quot;. He then proceedes to the front of the car, and kicks the
&gt; headlights as hard as he can. &quot;these babys arent breakin either!&quot; . He then
&gt; asks me if i like what i saw so far and if im interested in this vehicle. I
&gt; looked down at speedometer &quot;hmmmm 60 miles? You expect me to buy a car that
&gt; has had 60 miles of you beatin the sh!t out of it?&quot;....the salesman didnt
&gt; know what to say.
&gt; Could this be the reason some of our beloved VW's seem to have so much wear
&gt; and tear on them? sagging doors, worn out hinges, worn front end, the list
&gt; goes on. Perhaps there was a water test where they drenched them with a fire
&gt; hose to show they wouldn't leak, hence the rust plague! =)
&gt;
&gt; Anyone here ever buy a new 60's bus from the dealer, what were the selling
&gt; tactics?
&gt; Did the friendly VW salesman give it the old strength test a few hundred
&gt; times before selling it to the owner?

&gt; =)
&gt; P.S.S. fiance' forced me to buy a new VW. Wouldnt take &quot;restored bus?&quot; for
&gt; an answer. Im still workin on her.
