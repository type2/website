 Is there a set of instructions, step by step, on the web 
 anywhere, that I could reference?
 
 Thanks. &gt;&gt;

Hello,

No, there isn't any reference material like that that I am
aware of.  You stated that you have disassembled a
transaxle 5 years ago but did you also reassemble it?
If so then you do have the required tools to take the
gearbox apart, put back together, and adjust the shift
forks?  You do have the 3.875 ring and pinion, the '67
or '68 8-bolt swingaxle differential so the 3.875 8-bolt
ring gear can bolt up,  the 1.217 3rd from a swingaxle
Type II and a .82 4th from a '68-'73ish 002 Type II IRS,
and all the various shims to properly set the pinion 
depth and backlash, and the shims to properly set the
diff housing side bearing preload?   Its not a overly
complicated task ( I think that most people who can
rebuild a motor can also do a transaxle ) but do you
just want a slap together job or a long lasting one?
Good luck with your quest- I have a couple of these
3.875 conversions to do this week.
