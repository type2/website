&gt; you got to figure its safer in germany and france than it is here.
&gt; They are against war. So who are the terrorists gonna go after?
&gt; Id be more nervous about travelling to Washington or NYC.

That was my point exactly.  She's got some bizarre fear that people in
Germany will be protesting Americans.  

Look, I know its paranoid, but I'm trying to come up with some concrete
reasons why it will be safe.  I realize it 10,000 times more dangerous
to drive to work every day, but when someone is irrational, what are you
going to do?

Just looking for some Gov. sites that have reasons why/why it will be safe.

Women....pfft!   (No offense Clara :-)
