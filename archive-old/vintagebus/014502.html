Hi Tim,
We would stack a framework under the bus forward of the tranny out of 4&quot;X4&quot;s 
for more security, and more stability.

 48:
 49: 3) Remove rear rocker panel.&gt;&gt;
           Hmm, sounds like he means the rear apron to us there.

 50:
 51: 4) Place trolley jack under rear trans mount bracket.
 52:
 53: 5) Loosen lower shock mounts and remove four bolts holding each
 reduction box to spring plate.
 55:
 56: 6) Remove front tranny mounting bolts and nuts holding rubber mount
 to trans.
 57:
 58: 7) Disconnect shift linkage.
 59:
 60: 8) Remove two huge rear tranny mounting bolts. (Engine and trans are 
resting on trolley jack, remember)
 62:
 63: 9) Using crowbar (protect trans case w/ block of wood), gently lever 
engine/trans backwards until you have just enough space to remove old mount 
and install new one. Engine/trans will pop back into position when you let go 
the crowbar because clutch cable etc will pull it back. You may have to guide 
the studs through the holes in the trans.
 68:
 69: 10) Reassemble in reverse (or preferred) order.
 70:
 71: 11) Check all your work and that your levering engine/trans hasn't 
popped something out of place.
 73:
 74: 12) Drive to work on Monday morning.
 
 
&lt;&lt;Does this sound right?&gt;&gt;
      Yes, except he left out disconnecting the accelerator, clutch cable and 
fuel line.  Which you will have to do if you remove the engine completely.  
We would go ahead and disconnect and plug the fuel line either way this was 
done to avoid having the engine/tranny shift to one side and pour fuel all 
over you if the line was pulled off.  Removing the accelerator cable and 
clutch would also make moving the engine/tranny back far easier, and less 
chance to get your fingers caught between the tranny nose cone and bus body 
if you slip with the crowbar.  We have done what this fellow is talking about 
and it does work, but is not without it's dangerous draw backs.  Especially 
having the VW fall on you if you have to pry real hard with the crowbar with 
the VW on jackstands only.
 
 &lt;&lt; I need to change my fuel sender, so I'll probably pull the engine anyway, 
but if it seems like it might work, I might do  it right away and wait to 
pull the engine to have it out this winter.  Any details missing? (where to 
mount the mount first; trans or frame?)&gt;&gt;
Removing the engine would make things alot easier plus you can check the 
clutch to make sure it is doing well, add grease to the throwout bearing, and 
make sure it is even in relationship to the input shaft, and so on.  Removing 
the engine will only cost you an hour or two of your time.  If you are going 
to just replace the front mount then leave the rear frame on the tranny.  
Just take out the two lower bolts out of the frame horns to allow the tranny 
to slide backwards.  If decide you are going to remove the tranny/engine from 
the bus completely you might want to first check if you can remove the 
forward shift linkage coupler bolt/s. If you can remove the rear section of 
the shift rod while the tranny is out and down you can clean out the shift 
tube, clean the rod, and check the shift rod bushings for wear and tear.  
Replace the rod bushings if necessary, grease like mad the rod and it's tube. 
 You will not believe the differance in shifting ease!

 &lt;&lt;Thanks again!!! - Tim Gartman - 67 westy  &gt;&gt;
You are welcome,  Eric&amp;Barb
