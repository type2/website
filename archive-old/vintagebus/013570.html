Subject: Stuck in 4th transmission
Message-ID: &lt;19991004102512.9352.qmail_at_nwcst289_dot_netaddress_dot_usa_dot_net&gt;

Thanks, all who responded to my plight (sp?) on the &quot;stuck in 3rd&quot;
transmission.

I had a friend shift through the gears to make sure the linkage was OK. I have
to make a correction, though - it is stuck in 4th gear, I think. The reason I
say that is that is because when I put it in each
individual gear, the transmission will lock up except when I put it in the 4th
gear or if I leave it in neutral. Then by looking at the ratio of the clutch
plate - to wheel rotation, it appears to be in 4th gear. The other gears feel
perfect, but when I try to put it in 4th, it feels mushy and it never &quot;clicks&quot;
in. I haven't changed the oil nor have I ever driven it. I don't know the
history of this bus, so I'm just going by what I feel in the gear shift.  For
the benifit of all, I'll keep you posted in what I find.

Thanks!
Paul
