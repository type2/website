&gt; Yesterday I yanked the enging, yes the flywheel is

&gt; they fun to get off?).  When I push and pull on it
&gt; there is about 5 millimeters worth of play.  Is that
&gt; normal or should I go through more of a engine rebuild
&gt; than just a flywheel replacement?  Maybe I just need
&gt; some shims/washers to take out the play when I put a
&gt; new flywheel on?  

5 mm worth of play? that's...like um..... bad. That could very easily
be the reason your rear seal is leaking. spacers will not take out
this endplay. if you want it fixed I feel pretty sure you will be
doing an rebuild. I suppose it's possible for the flywheel to be
actually installed incorrectly and not seated on the crank, but in
either case you will be giving that engine a good looking at.

&gt; My other question is about the oil.  Would the oil
&gt; sneaking by be caused by the warped flywheel or should
&gt; I replace a seal?  Any pointers toward a good resource
&gt; for doing that task?  I haven't looked in my Idiots
&gt; guide or my Bently yet for this info.

it &quot;could&quot; cause a warped flywheel, be letting the clutch spin a lot
creating extra heat, but if this engine is as far out as it sounds
from the endplay, it might have just been warped to begin with and
never resurfaced.
