&gt;  install of a new to me light switch, I was able to get most of the stuff 
&gt;  working (thanks for the diagram Thom). No turn signals and no brake lights 
&gt;  still though. I hope that replacing the switch at the master cylinder will 
&gt;  fix the brake lights but I'm lost on the signals. 

try attaching the wires together and see if that makes them work. (key on)  
if it does your switch is bad.  if it doesn't see if you have power at one of 
the wires- they are the same colour so check both, one should be hot with 
ignition on.   If not you have to trace it above there- fuses ok?


&gt;  marking, so the instalation was a breeze. but still no signals front or 
rear.
&gt;  
&gt;  The rear bulbs I know are good the fronts I cant get the lense off of due 
to 
&gt; 
&gt;  a stuck screw on each one. these are soaking and hopefully will come off 
&gt;  tomorrow. The switch on the column feels good, Holds well at least. Are 
&gt; there 
&gt;  bits inside I should clean?  Are the non functional brakes/signals tied 
&gt;  together somehow?

...jump a hot wire from the battery to the taillight terminals.  if no 
lights, then maybe you have a bad ground or bad bulb holder or bad bulb or 
combination of these.   I like the bay window bulb holders with push on for 
extra ground, works better.
