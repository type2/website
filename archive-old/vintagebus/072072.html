&lt;&lt; I want to do some work on the steering.  I have replaced only the drivers 
side tie rod end so far ( not to fix steering but just to be safer ).
 The steering is a bit sloppier than it needs to be.  What's the best order 
of toubleshooting.
 
 I was thinking of replacing the drag link, then the steering damper, then 
adjusting the steering box.  WW sells a swing lever kit that looks like it might 
tighten things up a bit, what kind of job is that anyway?
  &gt;&gt;
the first thing to do is get out your idiot book and read the 'shimmies and 
shakes' chapter.   then get a friend to wiggle the steering wheel while you lay 
under the bus and follow the steering from the steering box to the drag link 
to the swing lever to the tie rods to the spindles. wiggle at the joints means 
a bad end.   Then jack the front up  (2x4 on jack under the front beam just 
behind the swing lever is a good place, ebrake on) and shake each front wheel 
at 6 and 12 , then at 3 to 9 o clock, like muir says.   this should diagnose 
your steering as to where the slop is.   now as the bus is jacked up, grease the 
suspension till clean grease comes out.  wipe the extra grease on where the 
moving parts in the brake cables and accerator linkage etc are.   adjust the 
link pins, which takes two 17mm wrenches and is easy.   drain and refill the 
steeringbox, and adjust it as per muir.   when I drained the 65s steering box, 
some water came out.   bad.   note that I am not telling exactly how all this 
stuff says what, as muir does a great job.

if your bus shimmies when you hit a bump, and wiggling the wheel takes you 
out of the shimmy, the steering dampner is bad, replace it.
