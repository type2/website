I posted about the irs conversion, and I guess I should step back a minute 
and say anythings possible, and what you want to do to your bus is your 
business.

But what I really want to get accross is that for people lacking the skills, 
time, and money, there are ways of making that swing axle perform better 
then stock with out such dramatic changes. No, I have not personally done 
anything to my busses, but I have seen some changes that can help. You can 
get a rear stabilzer bar, this helps. Urethane tranny mounts can help too. 
Wheel/tire combinations, such as 15 inch rims with low profile tires can 
help.

ETC, ETC
