	Well I bought a 1968 bus the other day and the PO said he thought
the tranny(gearbox)  was wasted. I got it home and tried to turn it
over....It seemed like it was stuck in gear and when ya put the clutch in
it would force yer foot back up while starting it. I tried to start it in
gear with the clutch up thinking that it would lurch forward...but
nope...

	Today I pulled the motor off...First time, used the Idiots
guide..which on VW Buses and cars in  general I am...Came off rather
easily but some metal pieces fell onto the ground when I pulled it off.
Now Johnny baby didn't mention little rods of metal falling out... so I
thought &quot;this can't be good&quot;. And from what  I see I don't think it is.
The flywheel is separated from the engine and stuck inside the tranny
section...I assume the gland nut snapped off and is in there too. There
was four holes that are now oblong and shredded on the motor and
flywheel....Inside these holes were three (used to be four at one time)
little round pins.. Now i think at one time they used to be welded but
not anymore... Also for the life of me I can't get the flywheel out of
the tranny section...It is supposed to come out of there right?

	My two questions are...is this easily fixed and...If the tranny
is locked up could this be caused by the PO trying to restart it...I
would hate to replace this stuff and go to restart it and snap it off
again cause the tranny is bad. Or is this a weak point in the motor and
happens due to wear...

	Any feedback appreciated.
