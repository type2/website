buses and ballons was a blast. my pop-top off to
route 66 splits for a great time, and good bsussing
if you like a true bus camp-out, bsussing, a hellofalotof
ballons (700 or more hot air) some good swap and
just one kick back time,. go next year!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!.
cruised there and back average 65-68 mph
had a semi let me draft him for a few a coupler hours
as my over loaded bus (due to stuff found) had a case
of the hilly blues, 1776 single port going in now, vwhowards
bus ran flawlessly with his 1776 duel port, hated following me
due to my speed changes do to terrain (got him back finally)!
could tell hours of stories, but your probally bored already,
so vwhoward i'm sure will finish


1200 miles later vwhoward and i got home
no problems except a lost shift coupler bolt(mine), but that lead
to finding the1 owner (church bus) 65 deluxe (hardtop)
in extremley excellent shape, apart from the thieves over the
years who stole some parts, the bus was parked in 1977 (i think
thats what the owner said ) when it developed a rod knock, still
has the complete original engine, never been out? with govener and all
f/r bumpers, trim etc. original paint(highly faded) with a perfect
headliner, oh ya 3 beauty rings!, vwhoward didn't wanty it, so i am
going to purchase it for my wife, (you'll be hearing from me now dougless)
since i don't know didley about deluxes, love them commercials though.
we also found some other stuff to be talked about later,
was a good trip for parts and buses, to bad it took 1200 miles to find this
stuff.
PS this buses only rust was at the bulkhead floor being 2 pop-outs being
stolen
otherwise RUST FREE, the owner knows what fair market value is, and i
agreeded
to pay it, so it wasn't a STEAL, just a nice clean bus to drive at a fair
price

PSS  the famous swap panel is for serious sale now
have to many buses and to many more to get

as far as flat fours abarth/empi 4 tip muffler, it will fit
a bus only with beating the crap out of your rear valance
prying and screaming, bitching and moaning, they really need to
upgrade there jigs and whoever is doing there copying of exhust!
after fighting the abarth/empi copy, sent it back for a refund, but
settled for there &quot;&quot; bus header&quot;&quot; instead, even worse, i may
have got prototypes, or it was a friday and there underpaid
import labor was thinking of tequilla and tacos, sent it back
for another header and it sort of fit, but o well!! now their wheels
and steering wheels are real nice though.
