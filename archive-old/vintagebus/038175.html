Subject: Do side scoops work????
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

OK....I know they are not stock BUT......

the bus will have 2-3 runs from LA to Sacromento  or San Jose in the next 
month going up Interstate 5......thats a 4000 ft climb,,,,,,and it can be HOT 
100 degrees plus, 400 miles each way.......

not sure what size the motor is as it came in the bus......1600cc or larger
The bus already has the holes for the scoops .......

so has anyone really tested these scoops ? or is it &quot;old wifes tales&quot;

and no I am not going to cut out the wheelwells and put chrome reverse Chevy 
rims with adapters.............Or a big 8 track in the dash.............
