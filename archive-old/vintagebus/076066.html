Subject: Re: [VB] the Scoop on Scoops...

&gt;if the asking price
&gt;  wasn't too bad, they were probably worth buying. just make sure they
&gt;  weren't just sending you the book of technical articles :P
&gt;  --  &gt;&gt;
&gt;................
&gt;I think that is what they were offering to send me...
&gt;
&gt;is there something wrong with them?  I haven't seen the book of tech
&gt;articles, what's it like?  Sounded interesting, but i didn't send them money.
&gt;

no, nothing wrong at all with them... very informative, in fact. it's 
just that what YOU would be after are the graphs and notes gene took, 
rather than the articles where he says things like &quot;x makes engine 
runs hotter - i tested it, and that's what i say the results are.&quot;  i 
don't doubt his conclusions, but i'd like to know the testing setups 
and the numbers he bases his opinions on.
