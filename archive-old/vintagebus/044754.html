 Hi All,
 
 A few days ago I posted a question regarding my vin and engine type for my
 '59 double cab and got a response from Clara:
 
 She said
 &quot;thanks for including your VIN, as it was a mid year change.   The &quot;modified
 36hp&quot; motor aka bastard 40hp was introduced at CH # 469 447 on May 19 1959.
 There also changed at this point to the tunnel case tranny from the split
 case tranny.  So, yours is one of the very first post 36hp buses.   In the
 36hp buses it is a bit tricky installing a motor with the later heater boxes
 as they tend to hang up.&quot;
 
 Well, I just went and checked and I found the following:
 
 - VIN 469869 (all three tags match i.e. the screw on one in the engine
 compartment, the stamped one by the engine and the one behind the seat)
 - Engine number 3047914 (with cast generator stand... so it's a 36 hp
 right?)
 - Also it appears to be a split case transmission (i.e. there are bolts
 holding the two halves together).
 
 BTW, the tag behind the seat reads 361, UP 265 BLUE (Dove Blue I presume)
 
 So gurus.... what's the deal?
 
 Thanks
 
 David

The engine number with the cast in gen stand would be a 36hp motor.

1 of 2 things happened

either you bus came with the split case tranny and 36 hp motor, and the 
factory change numbers are slightly off (I have found places where this has 
happened, though yours should be the 422nd bus w/tunnel case/bastard 40hp, 
according to the VW book my 61 should be in the first 50 buses with rounded 
speedo pod, but it has the pointy cornered version)  or

someone retrofitted your bus with the 36hp/ split case tranny set up.   Look 
at where the nose cone of the tran bolts to the body- if there is an adaptor 
plate this has happened.

I personally like the split case tranny.  Remeber with it, however, you must 
be at a full and complete stop to engage reverse or first gears, no switching 
gears when you are rolling or expect the crash and grind.

I have seen a number of buses that came with a split case tranny having been 
retrofit with the tunnel case version, however, have only once seen it done 
the other way around.

Another thing I noticed is that on the earlie buses w/o M code tag, the body 
number which is stamped where the M coide tag later is placed, on regular 
models the numbers (body and chassis) are very close, but on unusual models 
such as sunroof buses or 23 windows the numbers are further apart.     What I 
can exptrapolate from this is that the body number is stamped much earlier in 
the production lline, and it takes the unusaul models longer to go through 
the process of manufacture, and thus when the vin got put on the difference 
was larger.    Perhaps this is why my 61 m 130 deluxe w/ options has the 
pointy corners pod, as it was put on when the normal buses on the line would 
have them, but by the time the VIN got attached, the buses had gone to the 
rounded version, it being just at that junction time.  I suppose something 
similar could have occured with your doublecab, and unusual model that would 
have taken longer on the line than a panel van.   It is surprisingly close to 
the switchover.

Hope this makes sense.

Clara
