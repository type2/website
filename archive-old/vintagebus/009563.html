The problem with installing the sender using a T-fitting at the OP sending
unit is that there is not any oil flow going past the sender.  Once the
engine
is running the T-fitting is a dead-end for the oil.  Once the fitting is
filled with oil the pressure will keep that same oil in the fitting.  The
temperature that you will be reading will be from the fitting which will
come from part oil and part engine case.

The oil pressure sender location will read 50 degrees or so low.  The sender
is well isolated from the case and out in the breeze in addition to being
out of the main flow path of the oil.
I like pretty much any location in the sump area myself.  I figure that's a
meaningful reading whether in the drain plug, relief valve, or dipstick.  If
you are mainly concerned with when the oil is getting too hot, not the exact
temperature at all times I highly recommend the Berg over-temp dipstick for
$10 and running a separate wire and light for it.  I have checked these
things with a calibrated Fluke temp meter and they are more accurate than my
temp gauges.  They start to flicker in the 225 degree range.  They  have
found that the sender that mounts in the T-3 block off plate can give too
hot of readings from exhaust temps if you use merged headers, but most folks
on this list shouldn't need to worry about that.
