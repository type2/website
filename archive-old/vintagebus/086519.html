&gt;  I use a little more flexible fuel line than needed between the tank and

&gt; undo the fuel line from ABOVE
&gt; which keeps it from dripping on me at all.   :)   YAY!

I just put ballcock shut off valves on mine, twist and disconnect. only
fuel that escapes is the few drops between the valve and the engine and I
just let that drop into a small can and throw back into the tank

&gt; Jules,
&gt;  I got sick and tired of having gasoline running down my arms and into
&gt; my eyes and being a potential fire hazard. It didn't seem to matter
&gt; whether I had a good clamp on either end or not as there is always some
&gt; residual gas in the lines.

Bob
