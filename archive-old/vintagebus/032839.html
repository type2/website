check the rear shifter linkage.  It is just in front of the tranny.  Lie 
under it with a flashlight while you have a friend shift the gears.   The 
linkage piece should not flex or twist, it should hole the shift rod firmly 
to the hockey stick.  If it is bad, replace it.   you can also check to see 
if the 8mm square headed screws are snug.  and they should have wire through 
the holes, tosted around the rod to keep them from backing out- make sure the 
wire is arranged so the bolts don't back out.

&gt;  I started having shifter problems, which I'll attempt to describe...
&gt;  
&gt;  Basically, if you can get it in first or second, it's hard to get it in
&gt;  third or fourth.  If you can get it in 3rd or 4th, it's hard to 
&gt;  go back to 1st or 2nd.  
&gt;  
&gt;  I messed with the plate, experimenting with it every which way, including
&gt;  upside down, but I can't make it shift any better.  How tricky is this
&gt;  adjustment?  And/or, should I be looking further back for my problem?  
&gt;  
&gt;  Messing with the shifter is definitely a grimy, aggravating business.
&gt;  I pretty much stopped trying to fix it and parked the bus until I can
&gt;  approach it with some understanding,  somebody to hold the shifter 
&gt;  from above the floor, and maybe gloves.
