Subject: RE: [VB] Air backpressure

Hi Mike,

The short answer is no.  To keep the cylinders cool you need two things to
happen:

First and foremost the cylinder must wick and radiate heat out to be
&quot;caught&quot; by the passing air.  The better the cylinder material the better
radiating that can occur.  Cast iron is what most VWs use, which is fairly
poor at this task, but given the horsepower output of a VW it does not
matter much.  Some people paint the cylinder flat black to help keep rust
off and provide a good bed to wick heat away.  Then the high rollers move up
to Birals or Nickies, http://www.lnengineering_dot_com/ (the best!  just bring
your wallet.).

Secondly, airflow.  The more air you can pass over the cylinder the better.
So the more CMF you can get the better the heat will be moved away from the
cylinder and more cool air that will pass over the hot cylinders.  Look at
the 911 and see the mass quantities of air that go over the cylinders, lots
of heat too because the engine is tuned higher than any ACVW.

*Third, one to grow on information :)  A lot of people like to compare the
911s to the ACVW motors... Sometimes this is a good thing and sometimes bad.
For the example of cooling I think it is most always a bad comparison
because of the cylinder material differences.  When comparing the early 911
to an ACVW you can draw some similarities, but not the later Birals or
Nickies (which are awesome and waaay better at dispersing heat).  Heck the
early 911s with cast iron cylinders sucked just as bad as the ACVW at
getting rid of heat.  Once the 911 moved to the Nickies later in life the
power potential was unleashed and at least in the 911SC model the P&amp;Cs can
live upwards of 400K miles untouched (no joke - documented by many
people)...  When you run Nickies I am sure you could toss the Blue Book
(Berg) and add a few more points to the CR as well due to the better cooling
:)  Muuuuhahahaha

Also to note in the 70s Mahle made a bore in 88mm P&amp;C set for EMPI that was
of biral design... Not sure why it died off.  You can read about it in Bill
Fisher's book if you care to. 

** As a side note to the previous discussions on the 912 pulley upgrade be
sure to take care of your fan as to not let it explode due to the higher
RPMs it will be turning (Eric&amp;Barb reminded me to mention this in an
off-list e-mail).  I will be welding the tabs on mine before installing the
pulley.  I think Berg still offers a welded fan if you do not care to weld
one up yourself.

Doesn't the slow down effect of cool tin force more heat exchange from a
larger
area of the cylinders?

&gt; I think John Connoly said it best in this snippet:
&gt; &gt;Narrowing the tube increases the velocity, but decreases the volume
(engine
&gt; would run hotter from LESS air). Think of a garden hose; do you get more
or
&gt; less water when you put your thumb over the end? How MUCH air you get is
&gt; what cools your engine off, not how fast it's moving.
&gt;
&gt; John&lt;
&gt;
&gt; The T3 tin although good for stock I think is not good for additional
&gt; airflow given John's explanation above.  The key to cooling will be volume
&gt; over pressure.
&gt;
&gt; For what it is worth, this is, as far as I can recall, the first issue I
&gt; have come to disagree with Bob Hoover on.  Usually his stuff is as good as
&gt; gospel :)  (One person you should never question unless you really have a
&gt; clue about what you are talking about)
&gt;
&gt; Lets take the same amount of work (which you have to do for any bigger
&gt; engine) and do it to the T1 tin and I think the T1 tin will be better
given
&gt; a higher air flow.  After all each tin can only butt up against the
cylinder
&gt; fins so close no matter if it is T1 or T3.  The air is shot down the
middle
&gt; of cylinders 3/4 and 1/2.  Now how do you get sufficient air to the outer
&gt; sides of the cylinders?  Less pressure on the sides to create the pressure
&gt; drop to flow air in that direction...  Otherwise it puddles in the middle
&gt; and straight out the bottom.
&gt;
&gt; One thing that Hoover mentions is the pressure drops at the heads... In my
&gt; view this is over simplified.  Take into consideration the veins in the
fan
&gt; shroud that direct some air to the heads and some air to the cylinders and
&gt; you are not talking a pure clump of unmanipulated air pressure.  The air
&gt; directed to the heads mainly will stay at the heads even with a severe
&gt; pressure drop somewhere else.  Given the old theory that an object (air)
in
&gt; motion tends to stay motion in the direction of its given energy path
&gt; (severely paraphrasing the theory here).
&gt;
&gt; Examine the T3 tin closely and someone please explain how &quot;about 1360 cfm
_at_
&gt; 4000 rpm.&quot; (per Hoover quoting a VW manual) will fit through the tinny T3
&gt; bottom holes?  Of course lets say half of that gets used for the heads
&gt; (maybe more).
&gt;
&gt; Lets see how the early Porsche 911T accomplishes the same thing:
&gt; http://www.pelicanparts_dot_com/914/Parts/914-6/914-6_sheet_metal_big.htm
&gt; Look specifically at part 21.  (note to you all out there running T1 911
&gt; shroud look kits #18, air veins! - no T1 kit I have seen addresses this at
&gt; all.)
&gt;
&gt; So what can we tell from the 911 lower tin... I am not sure.  Simply it
&gt; looks more like a T1 tin setup, but has the curved ridges on the sides
&gt; similar to the T3.  I would consider it a hybrid between the two unless
&gt; anyone has a better observation than me?
&gt;
&gt; Whew... fingers tired.  Please anyone feel free to comment on observations
&gt; of your own.
&gt;
&gt; Take Care,
&gt; Adrian

&gt; &gt; Okay since we are on the maximum fan air issue with pulley ratios...
Lets
&gt; &gt; talk air flow :)
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; It has been reported by a few very knowledgeable people that the T3
bottom
&gt; &gt; tin &quot;super cool tin&quot; modification that a lot of us perform is counter
&gt; &gt; productive to maximum air flow.
&gt;
