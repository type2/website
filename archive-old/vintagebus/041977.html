&gt; when I tlked to the man about this it had something to do with torque and

&gt; I guess. They do not run at a costant 4500 rpm that is just the max at what
&gt; they take the RGB too. He is sending me the blueprints and specs on this
&gt; along with all the VW part numbers they use in these airplanes. The original
&gt; plans stated &quot;go to your nearest VW Dealer and get the parts you need over
&gt; the counter.

The main reason that the airplane folks use reduction units is that auto
engines tend to produce their best power at around 4500-5000RPM while the
speed of a typical propeller is limited to less than 3000RPM because at
higher RPMs the tips of the prop go supersonic, creating noise and
reducing efficiency.  The only other solution is to go with a smaller
diameter prop, also bad for efficiency.
