I didn't catch the original post but I had a similar problem with my oil and 
found that it was a misadjusted carb. (Weber progressive)  For me no amount 
of tinkering and readjusting fixed the problem.  I changed over to a 34 PICT 
3 and have loved the results.  There was no change in performance except my 
oil quit smelling like gas and my gas mileage went way up. A good solution 
in many ways.  Just a thought.

Scott
