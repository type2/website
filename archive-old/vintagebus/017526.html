&lt;&lt;Has anyone used or heard a system using such an
antenna?  I'm curious of the
reception, though I assume it's as good as a home
stereo which uses much the
same type of antenna.&gt;&gt;

I went down to Audio Express (car stereo chain in az)
a few months ago and asked for an antenna alternative.
 They carry one that sticks to the windshield and is
about an inch or so wide.  It was just a tad bit
taller than my windshield.  I decided just to stick it
on the passenger side A? pillar.  It sticks right to
the metal and hardly anyone notices it.  No drilling
required.  The reception however is very directional,
and is not nearly as good as a traditional antenna.  I
do pick up the strong stations  though.  I'm not sure
about AM stations...  I have a cd changer too, so I
don't listen to radio that much anyways.  Antenna ran
about $30 or so.  If you want radio reception but
don't want to drill holes, this is the way to go.  If
you are attached to your radio and don't have a tape
or cd deck, then you may want the strong signal
reception of a traditional antenna.  Hope this
answered a few questions.
