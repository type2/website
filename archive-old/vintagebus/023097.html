I took the liberty of equipping my bus with a great stress relief device.
No, not a bed, but a siren!  When I come up beside some jahoo jabbering on
the phone and not paying attention to the phone, I give a quick blast,
which so far has shut every single test subject up!  Of course, I don't
think they could hear well enough afterwards to continue their conversation
anyway...
