Subject: Stock paint color Q's.  65 Samba

I have been preping all my parts for painting on my 65 Samba.  I was
grouping them by color yesterday and came accross some that i was not
sure about.  Can anyone out there help?  I am looking for the color the
Factory would have painted them back in late 64/early 65.

Shift rod
E-Brake handle
Front belly pan
Turn signal switch housing
Steering wheel
Windshield Wiper arms
Steering column
Steering Column support bracket

Anyone know what these parts may have been painted?  L-Code or name.

Thanks
Matthew
