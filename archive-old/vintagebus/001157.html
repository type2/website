I've got a good used gas heater for sale.  It is 12v and originally came out
of a 71 Crew Cab if I'm not mistaken.  I don't know what model # it is for
sure but it's that torpedo looking thing with a red plastic fan that goes on
the left side of the engine bay.  I bought it from a kind listee overseas in
the summer of '99 and was told it was functional but needed to be gone
through so it is safe to run.  Since we are in the winter season, I'm asking
$200 obo.  Please - no wishful thinkers - if you want it and you've got the
dough, I'll send it out pronto and you send me the money pronto.  Please
direct offers to silent_at_beatricene_dot_com - the highest bidder gets it.
