I did this too, basically due to George's recommendation when I was
fighting that last summer/fall. What I did was not tighten the wire too
darn much, so flexing was possible, yet the TO would get saved from
wasting the input shaft.
I have the pre 63? HD to shaft, with the full arms and holes, not slots.
I went throught the small grove in the TO, by the tubes the clips go in,
then through the arms holes, and twisted it off to the outside of the
arms, then cliped it even and bent that back halfway, as to not touch
anything. Then I worked the arm a couple times to make certain it didn't
bind or hold up the TO, as I figured it would just bust the wire quick
then.

We can not picture this safety wire routing, do you have a pic? Does
this then flex or bend with each clutch depression? P &amp; C

I also safety wire the springs in place.  Run thin stainless safety wire
through the holes in the spring clips and around the groove in the outer
race of the bearing.
