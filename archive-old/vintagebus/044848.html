 &lt;&lt;  Turning engine pulley in 4th gear to determine transaxle gearing? &gt;&gt;
 
 Here is the procedure for determining what gear ratios you have in your 
transaxle: 
 Start with one rear wheel jacked up and the other firmly on the ground. Put 
the transmission in the gear you want to check. (This works for all four 
gears) If the engine is in the car it will be easier with the spark plugs 
removed. If the engine is out put a clutch disc on the tranny output shaft. 
Make a mark on the clutch disc or the engine pulley, and make a mark on the 
tire as well. Rotate the tire 3 times and count the number of engine 
revolutions to the nearest 1/8. Divide engine count by axle count then 
multiply by 2. Convert this to a decimal and look for the closest value in 
the chart:  
 For example: 8-2/8 engine turns divided by 3,  times 2  =  5.5.  The closest 
thing on the chart is 5.52, so that would              
                         be a 1.26  3rd gear with a 4.38 ring &amp; pinion.
          example: (5-7/8) / axle (3) x 2 = 3.92  closest thing in the chart 
is 3.89. That would be an 0.89 4th gear with a 4:38 R&amp;P

    The basis of this chart was provided by Chris Zarzycki, published in the 
Formula Vee Newsletter June 1992. He provided the information on the first 
two ring and pinion columns (4:13 &amp; 4:38). I've added the 3:88 freeway flyer 
R&amp;P and the numbers for the reduction box combinations. You may have to check 
more than one gear to be sure of the result as some of the numbers are very 
close. Although I have no doubts about Mr. Zarzycki's figures, mine on the 
other hand are open to debate.
