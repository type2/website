Subject: Another idea concerning the 6v/12v dilemma
Message-ID: &lt;000901beafd1$e8d2b020$2bcb83ce_at_elassley.bie&gt;

I was talking with my grandfather today about the 6v/12v dilemma I'm having
with the bus.  Well, I'm not really having it anymore as I decided that I'm
sticking with 6v.  He agreed that I could go ahead with the 6v and then
convert to 12v later if I really wanted to.  I was however, lamenting the
fact that I had a couple of good used 12v alternators in the basement as
well as a good spare 12v battery that I wished I could use somehow.  I made
some comment about maybe shelling out some bucks to get one alt. rewiredfor
6v.  He then said something that I hadn't thought about and I thought the
idea was kind of neat.

He suggested that I go ahead and run the 12v alternator with 12v battery but
on the main power lead for the lights/radio/clock/etc., running a big
resistor (in this case I'd either locate a nice big finned resistor or some
commercial means to handle the drop) to handle the drop.  The resistor would
be located in the engine compartment for &quot;cooling&quot; air and then if I wanted
to run 12v items, it would merely require a 12v lead run up front.  I guess
this would make the bus a &quot;half converted&quot; bus but hell, they run multiple
voltages in military vehicles so if it works for them, it works for me.  I
think the only thing I would need to replace would be the voltage regulator
by doing it this way.

So of course, I've already ordered the XR700 coil from JCW in 6v and it
appears that it would be best if I went 12v on the engine, 6v for the
accessories in the bus.  And duh, I guess this makes it a 12v conversion
then doesn't it?  Oh the tangled webs I get into sometimes!

Anyone interested in a 6v XR700 brand new?  I'll sell it for what I paid for
it so I can get the 12v and you'll have the added advantage of quick
shipping (no long JCW delays) once I get it.
