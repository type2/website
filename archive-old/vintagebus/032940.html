&lt;&lt; Any ideas on the best way to change to a single res. single switch m.c.

Hi Jack,
Best not to!  The dual MC is alot safer.  If you blow out a brake line or a 
wheel cylinder you should still have about 50% of your brakes, instead of 
none in a single MC system.  
  If you are trying to keep cost down install a 1972-79 bus MC instead.  
Check out the article we produced in the type2 library on installing this in 
pre-1968 buses.  Cost total is about $50.00 for the new MC, and some parts 
from a local wrecking yard.
