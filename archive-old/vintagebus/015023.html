No, no. I don't want to get rid of it. As a matter of fact I was even
looking at one that was on eBay just before I brought this baby home. I
saw one somewhere else for like $125.00. Pretty expensive, ha? And it
might be true about it being replaced later on.

&gt;Hi, There's nothing wrong with having a unique bus! Although, if you
&gt;want to get rid of that KM speedo....I would gladly send you my MPH
&gt;speedo and some cash$$$$. I live in Canada, and would love to get my
&gt;hands on a KM speedo..
&gt; As far as the bus coming from Canada, I would say no, because we 
&gt;were
&gt;still in MPH in 64. I think we switched to metric in the mid 70's
&gt;Hope this helps
&gt;Mike
