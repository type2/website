the beam will not bolt up--the holes are spaced differently.  you'll need
to get one from a 68-69 and swap spindles after that to get disc. 
sorry........sort of.....for your bus!  what about running a vacuum line,
or are you not going to put the power assist on?  good luck on the rear,
too!!!!sounds like way more of a PITA than it's worth to me.
i personally dislike dual circuit brakes.  they always feel mushy to me.
anyway, good luck.

&gt; In a greater effort to enhance the braking power of my '66 I have decided
to
&gt; attempt (notice the word attempt) to put a front beam from a '75 bus into
a
&gt; '66 bus.  Apparently this is a fairly straight forward process, but want
to
&gt; run through the steps with you all before I miss something huge. 
&gt; Also if I have the '75 rear brakes is there any updates I can do to the
rear
&gt; brakes of my '66 while I am at it?  I hate adjusting those darn drums!
&gt; 
&gt; A special thank you goes to John Baker for giving the '75 up for adoption
in
&gt; the first place!  Thanks, it is being used to help save a '71 and upgrade
a
&gt; '66!  Hopefully it can help others in the long run by more parts donations
&gt; for the needy busses.
