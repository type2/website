Subject: Bus roofs?

Hi Volks,
Does anyone in the Oregon/Idaho/Wash are have one or two 1955-67 bus roof  
sections.  Looking for at least a left rear quarter of a roof to  fix our 1962 
SO-34 Westie that was DPO flipped on its side.  Another  for a friend who has 
an original camper converted panel that the conversion  place stuffed foam 
rubber in the roof for noise, heat insulation, and so has  rusted out the roof 
behind the front seats.....
  We will be traveling soon, so perhaps can arrange to  pickup.
Thanks,
Eric&amp;Barb
