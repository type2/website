&lt;&lt; Oh please. I have been known to hop in the limo at 1 in the afternoon in
 August when it is 110 in Phoenix and drive 2 hours to Havasu where it is 120
 just to drink cheap beer at John Howards and buy parts from Ronnie. It's
 only hot if you think it is.

I agree,  Everyday I have to jump in my 67 kombi and drive to east gilbert 
from west phoenix in the aftenoon.  It gets so hot that I cant open my 
safaris because i end up looking like a roasted chicken.  But just to make it 
easier I found tha having a clean bus (at least inside) will do wonders.  
Probably lowers the temperature mentally about 20 degrees.  haha!  Also i 
noticed that unlike a NEW car, i dont have to hide plastic thingies under the 
seat.  Just doesnt get as hot.

I love driving my bus and the heat will NEVER keep me from that!
