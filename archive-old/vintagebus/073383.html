Subject: Auxillary battery

Hey Y'all,
This weekend I took a 4 hour trip in my bus with a 5
year old and a 12 year old. After I yelled &quot;keep your
hands and other body parts to yourself&quot; for about the
90th time, I decided that I need to purchase a 12 volt
tv\vcr combo for these occasions.  I also have plans
of adding a gas heater.
So would electrical requirements for these things
dictate that I hook up an auxillary battery??
In the T2 library, found an article about hooking one
of these up, but the reading wasn't very
user-friendly. I will never have a need to run a
fridge off of this system, only small 9 inch tv\vcr
and a gas heater. Anyone have any advice about an easy
set up to do this??
So does someone sell a kit to add this, I need easy
install and clear directions.

=====
Peace, John Baker
