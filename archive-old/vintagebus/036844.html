&lt;&lt; So, do I expect that in such situations I should worry about doing a 180?&gt;&gt;
 
 P.S.  We won't even get into the engine braking thread on the VANAGON list,
 which would also have similar 180 degree implications?  &gt;&gt;
Hi Stephen,
Yes, would have to say that that is a possible senerio.  As for the
Vanagons(They do have the engine up front?  We do not deal in stuff that
late.), as long as a vehicle's weight is more on the front rather than the
rear then during braking that front is going to get even more of that wieght
and the rear will lift up.  My stepbrother just got a japan made front wheel
drive car and when we asked him about the problem he said he was told to just
speed up to regain control.  Personally the last thing we would want to do is
to speed up to regain control when there is some accident or other trouble
ahead that caused us to try to stop in the first place.  Have really loved the
old ACVWs for the fact that if you start to have the rear slip and slid while
in a turn or trying to stop all one has to do to regain control is to let up
on the gas while the VW is in gear.  Next thing you know you are in control
and slowing down.    Eric &amp; Barb
