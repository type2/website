&lt;&lt; Correct, they made only 1,000 westys from `51 to `59....estimate that to
 about 100-200 produced each one of those early years...you can come
 across a dozen or so barndoor deluxes before a barndoor westy...only 2
 are currently known to exist....one in Florida and one in France...like
 wise the early 50's era westy are also extremely rare.

Whew!!!!!  Chalk one up for the big man, Rusty Van Bondo, he has a westy
barndoor. I think he even has some pics scanned.
