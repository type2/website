Hi Paul,
No offense taken.  We just wanted to squelch the sniggers of those who really 
do not travel in thier VWs long distances.  We average 20,000 miles a year on 
just our 1960 panel camper.  Even though you are never far from anywhere you 
will encounter times that if you had a part you could have been back on the 
road in less than an hour rather spending the next half to whole day trying 
to get the part you suddenly need.  We are not suggesting that one must 
always carry all of these parts, but one would be wise to look these lists 
over and consider at least some of the part/tools.  Unfortunitely as time 
passes finding not only finding shops, but wrecking yards that carry parts 
for our cars is very much getting harder and harder.  Thusly volks have to 
get more reliant on onboard spare parts in addition to keeping a well 
maintained VW.   Hope we did not offend you, Eric&amp;Barb
