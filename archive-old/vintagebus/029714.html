Check straps are to stop the doors from opening fully, primarily to stop
interference with the front doors, not to stop them from hitting the body.
 Rubber stoppers are to prevent body damage when the check straps are disconnected.

Deluxes have the rubber piece in the middle of the aluminum trim, when the
doors fully open the rubber pieces hit each other.

If you want to know about rubber bumpers on trucks, ask Wade &lt;BG&gt;.

[...]
&gt;List- Please help me to answer this question (its bring driving me crazy
&gt;for 
&gt;several years now): you know panels,kombis, standards,and probably others
&gt;
&gt;were equipped with rubber bumpers mounted to the side of the vehicle that
&gt;
&gt;served to protect the body from damage when one of the vehicle doors was
&gt;
&gt;opened AND were also equipped with check straps on the side cargo doors.
&gt;On 
&gt;the other hand, DeLuxe buses were equipped with the check strap ONLY to
&gt;
&gt;obviously protect the side of the vehicle (in this case the aluminum 
&gt;beltline molding) from damage. Now my question- why were the non-DeLuxe
&gt;
&gt;buses equipped with BOTH rubber bumpers AND check straps???
