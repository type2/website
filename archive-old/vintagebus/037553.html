&lt;&lt; I have an extra big nut tranny layin' around and need cash so I thought 
I'd sell it.  A guy offered me $100 but I thought that sounded a little 
cheap. &gt;&gt;
Hi Adam,
It all depends on wether you know if the tranny is good or not, and that the 
gearing is not screwed up!  Otherwise an unknown/hopefully rebuildable center 
tranny section core is about $30.00, and the price of reductions depends on 
who and where you are!      Eric&amp;Barb
