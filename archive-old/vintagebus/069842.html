&gt; hm... I thought that they kept the recommended top/ cruising speed at
about
&gt; 3500 rpms.   This for a 25hp bus though later uppright VWs.   Where did
you
&gt; see something different?  Just curious.
&gt;

I've seen figures at and slightly above the 4000rpm mark for top cruising
speeds. I'll see if I can find the source for those....
