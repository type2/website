&lt;&lt; Thanks to Roger Nang I have a cargo door.
 But I have found out there are significant differences,
 I have a 63 single cab and it has the door prop not the spring holder upper.
 I believe that the spring went into use in 65.
 My 63 has 3 louvres that point out, the door off the 65 in the Sacramento 
 junk yard has two louvres that point in!
 
 So I have a repairable cargo door from a 64 single cab and want a 
 repairable/good door that is correct for a 63 singlecab.
 
 Any helpers
  &gt;&gt;
the spring was used as of ch 1 222 026 - dec 63 which is early in the 64 
model year 

the larger rear window was intoduced for the 66 model year truck, and they 
moved the air intake vents- believe they were then made innies not outies, 
and it is possible they changed the louvers on the treasure chest doors at 
the same time.

on the 67 trucks the square key is no longer used, the door has one hole for 
key rather than two holes- square key and regular key
