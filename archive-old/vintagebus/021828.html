Hi Volks,

sorry for crossposting, but I'd just let you know that the detailed 
invitation to our German bus meet is online now.  Point your browsers 
to

http://members.tripod_dot_com/~t2ig/calendar_e.html

BTW, our Web site is going to move soon - we've acquired the new 
domain www.bulli_dot_org for it, but not for our club exclusively.  If 
you'd like to move your Bus-related Web site there too, contact me 
via p-mail for details.

Thanks, and have a good weekend everybody!

Yours,
    Erik.
