&gt; Distributor cap.  That's an integral part of the ignition system.  The
&gt; wrong cap might not contact the rotor, therefore no spark.  Eureka.  If
&gt; you still have the old cap and rotor, put them back on and see what
&gt; happens.  If you were close I'd bet ya a Dr. Pepper.
&gt; 
thanks dave!  this evening i'll stop off at the shop and retrieve the old
distributor cap and give it a try.  i should say that while the cap did get
me home, the plug wires were just sort of resting on the cap - there wasn't
any grip.  also the next morning after driving it home, i could not get it
started.  it wasn't until just this last saturday that i tried using a
different (and correct) cap.

as suggested (thanks tom and kyle!) i did not match either cap to the rotor
but i did pull the rotor out of one of my beetles and my buddy compared the
clearances.  he liked the original better but neither rotor did it.  he was
over at my house yesterday messing around solo.  i don't know what he did
beyond trying different cap/rotor combinations but he was unsuccessful.
perhaps i need to give both the rotor and cap a try from one of my running
beetles.

hmm, upon reflection maybe i'll just bust on home and get that cap i've got
on the truck's engine and match it with a rotor at the shop this evening....
