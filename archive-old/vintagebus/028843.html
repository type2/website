    what andy said is correct.. in the sphere of most heavy trucks. different
systems from our buses.... the shoe is similar, but it doesn't entirely fit :)
    (though is it probably a good general guideline for all...)
    brake fade.... is the loss of braking due to excessive heat build-up, and
occurs in the following ways:
    1. When the brakes reach a high-enough temperature, the bonding material in
the brake linings begins to melt and rise to the surface. This fills up the
hills and valleys and lowers the coefficient of friction. As the driver pushes
harder on the brake pedal to try to compensate for this, more heat is generated.
As the rotor or drum overheats, its shape will distort and will result in less
lining to drum/rotor contact.
    2. When the temperature exceeds the boiling point of the brake fluid, the
fluid boils. While fluid can't be compressed, gasses can, so now the driver has
a low spongy brake pedal and no matter how far the pedal is pushed, the brakes
have no stopping effect. This is obviously a very dangerous condition.
    3. As the brake lining heats up it gives off a gas. This gas is normally
carried away by the drum or rotor. If the lining overheats, gas is produced
faster than it can be carried away. This will actually *prevent* the lining from
being able to touch the rotor or drum.
    disc brakes were developed due to the need for a brake that could dissipate
heat more rapidly than a drum brake. they have much more resistance to fade than
drum brakes.
    of course, if you are using organic pads in the place of OE semi-metallics,
you'll likely have problems with brake fade... probably also if you are one of
those people that does not have drums and discs turned at reline time. this
helps to restore the coefficient of friction when done properly.

&gt; I'm not buying this at all.  Not even for a dollar.  You get brake fad just
&gt; as easily with discs; where do the discs expand to?  If they swelled, then
&gt; you'd get more brakes sooner!
&gt;
&gt; My definition of brake fade comes from the racing guys over on the 911 list.
