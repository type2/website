&lt;&lt; Hi List, I just got back from the first day of the &quot;Great Canadian
 Bugshow&quot; in Toronto. I scored a couple of NOS Type 2 taillights:

  I'm not quite clear on the correct application. Am I right in assuming
 that one is the North American edition, and the other is the European
 edition????
 TIA
 
 Michael in Toronto...
  &gt;&gt;

the one with the flat glass and the thinner chrome bezel is a taillight for a 
post barn door brake light decklid semaphore bus (euro)   the one on the left 
is barndoor or post barndoor BLDL non Sempahore bus (N am), is it has two 
screw terminals (turn sig and taillight) it is the latter, one (just 
taillight) then it is BD.

pretty
