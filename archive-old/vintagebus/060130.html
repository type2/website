Subject: Help, red light on

Hey Volks

When reinstalling the formerly leaky engine in my Dormobile, I accidentally
cross connected the DF and earth cables to the generator (12V) and then
started and ran the engine for a short time.

Since then the red light has stayed on. It stays on with either of two good
generators fitted, so I suppose it's the regulator?

Any ideas on the problem and fixes?
