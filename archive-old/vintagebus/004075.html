Hey Folks, While driving home from my first show with my new bus, the engine
siezed (its a 1500).... After towing it home, I was able to free it up. It
seemed to turn over with no problems, so I decided to start it. I ran for a
few minutes, with no smoke or noise, but &quot;seized&quot; up again. One more time,
then it started to knock..
          Well today I pulled the heads to see if I could figure out if the
problem was in the top end. After looking at the at the heads and cyls. I
could not find any problems. The only odd thing I saw was a mark on one of
the connecting rods. Check out the pictures at

Does anyone have any ideas?????? Maybe a cam follower problem????
TIA
