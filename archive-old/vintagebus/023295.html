Wolfgang carries some of the bits.  Kelly (metwiz_dot_com) sells better

&gt;decide to make a Camper out of my 67 Panel, since I can't find one
&gt;reasonalby priced that I like.  The thing has been hit on the left nose and
&gt;need most of the corner replaced.  If I can replace it and take most of it
&gt;out.  I can straighten the nose panel.  This thing is just to solid

&gt;them for to with Windows. Oh by the way, I've looked at Rocky Mountain and
&gt;Wolfsburg.
