Yes the filter pumps do work and clear, no problem, I have one on my bus and
have installed on many others. Another option is CB performance filter sump.
I have 1 of these on my wifes stock 65 Beetle and on some of my previous
buses.

Subject: [VB] Oil Filtration Question


Hello!

I have been informed lately that I have to use a special oil pump and cannot
use my stock exhaust if I want to put a spin-on type oil filter on my
engines.  Is there a way to get around this?

Any suggestions?  I'm just running 1600's and I feel that a filter would
lengthen their lives.....

TIA
Gene
