In a message dated 98-10-23 11:09:40 EDT, you write:

&lt;&lt; The book goes to great lengths to say that the engine must be lined up
 with TDC and that the slot on the drive pinion is in a very specific
position.
  Upon reflection, is it REALLY that important that the slot is lined up
exactly?
 If its not lined up exactly (like off a few degrees) can't the distributor
merely be turned to point at #1 to compensate?  &gt;&gt;
Hi Markus,
It does not really matter where you have the drive aligned as long as #1
cylinder is at TDC when the rotor is pointing to the notch in the distributor
that marks the #1 cylinder saprak plug location.  Never time by #3 or have
your #3 cylinder plug hooked into this notched mark area of the distributor.
