Subject: Re: [VB] time to fix this leaky tranny

I buy the tranny oil by the gallon jug-  sta-lube.  You can also buy the 
pump, that screws to the top of the bottle.  To fill a splitty tranny RGB to 
RGB take 3 and a bit quarts- just under a gallon.     

Where is it leaking?

&gt; ouple little questions, as I'm planning to finally get in there and fix
&gt;  that leak this week sometime.
&gt;  
&gt;  Anyone know how much gear oil the tranny holds?  GL-4, right?  Last week it
&gt;  took 1.4 litres to top it up after about 2500 miles of driving.
&gt;  
&gt;  I keep reading about people squirting the oil in with some type of gun or
&gt;  something??  What is this exactly?  All the grease guns I can find look 
like
&gt;  caulking guns and take tubes of grease.  I'd really like it if there was a
&gt;  better way than trying to defy gravity by squeezing the oil out of the
&gt;  bottle into the transmission while it oozes down my arm.  Ahhh.. eau de 
gear
&gt;  oil.  attracts boys like flies.  not.
&gt;  
&gt;  Wish me luck,
&gt;  Diana
