Subject: Engine update and a couple of questions

Hello Friends!

Got my 1776 fully assembled today. Replaced all tin that was mangled or
missing, painted it low gloss black. Replaced the left side heater box,
as my old one was missing the tabs on the bottom for the sheet metal.
Mounted the 40mm Webers. I had to fab a short bit of linkage that I
couldn't find (I bought the carbs used), and got everything wired and
plumbed nice and neatly.

Started the engine with a blast of starting fluid, until the float
chambers got enough gas to run on their own. It fired right up on the
first rev... very nice!

Here are my questions: The engine doesn't want to idle, and I'm not sure
how to tune dual carbs. I've got the vacuum tool (I forget what it's
called). The carbs have adjusters on the linkage to adjust the closed
position on the butterfly, and each have a spring loaded screw on the
carb. Is the spring loaded screw for idle? A short procedure for
adjusting dual carbs would be very greatly appreciated...

Secondly, I've got a Kadron header on it right now, from one of my old
1641 engines. It is especially loud on this engine, I suppose because it
has a lot more going thru it. I don't like giving The Man excuses to
pull me over, so I'd like something a lot quieter... any
recommendations?

I've decided to keep the vac dizzy with the 1641, which is going into my
son's 67 deluxe, so I'm running an 009 (also, I'm trying to keep the
engine compartment as clean as possible, with as few hoses and wires as
possible). Normally I max the advance at 28-30. Is this applicable with
this engine?

Here are the specs again: 1776, CW stock crank, 110 cam, 40mm dual
webers, 009, compufire ignition, Kadron header (for now).

Thanks in advance,

david
