Subject: Re: [VB] &quot;Slightly Custom&quot;

While it's pushing it a tad, I still think this bus &quot;looks&quot; mildly 
custom. The roof is what pushes it for me. But the overall feel of 
the bus is mild custom in my opinion. Obviously people will disagree 
and I don't want to argue about it, but just wanted to chime in.

I think this is a fine looking bus and would easily be worth the 
money for someone looking for something like that. I do agree that 
making a custom bus for profit is harder to sell than a stock one. 
And many times don't fetch the same price. But I don't think this one 
is too far off for what it is. It's a nice bus. With very fine 
workmanship.

My opinion for the record.
