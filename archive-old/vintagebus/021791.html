&lt;&lt; To which I must reply: GET A GRIP. The installation of non crow's foot
 wheels on a truck or crow's feet wheels on a bus will not send it over a
 cliff. You have my personal guarantee. I know this may shock you, but a lot
 of people are running around with (gasp) bug smoothies on their buses, and
 amazingly, Porsche alloys or aftermarket rims which were not hand fabricated
 by Ben Pon Himself. One would presume that if this caused the vehicles to
 suddenly pitch over tall cliffs this would be a self regulating population,
 however I have seen no evidence to suggest that these people are involved in
 any greater incidence of cliff plunging than the general population. I never
 suggested that the crow's feet were a 'significant reinforcement for trucks
 and panels only' or that the difference was so huge that in your view the
 parts book would surely have indicated it. I mentioned that I had heard they
 were for trucks.&gt;&gt;
Hi Kyle,
We were just trying to illustrate that if they were a truck/panel only this 
would be for a reason not just to look good, and if so the parts book would 
most likely be listed as truck only.  

&lt;&lt;  I think Frankiehil said that he believed they were just made by a 
different manufacturer, which sounded perfectly reasonable to me.&gt;&gt;
which is what we think happened!  We just can not see any justfication for 
truck/panel only theory.

&lt;&lt;When you came in saying that they couldn't be for a different application 
because your parts books didn't list a different number for them, I pointed 
out a well known discrepancy with parts numbers being the be-all and end-all 
of what went for what. I have no idea where or why you came up with the rest 
of this stuff and don't care, but don't twist my words to make me look like 
an ass. I am perfectly capable of doing that for myself, you can ask anyone. 
&gt;&gt;
Slow down and take a breath.  We were not trying to make you look bad just 
talking this out.  Sorry to hear you take it so badly.  Eric&amp;Barb

&lt;&lt; For an example, did you ever consider than maybe all of the pre-1960 non 
crow's foot rims in the PNW rusted out?  Try coating them with tar next
 time. 8^)&gt;&gt;
 Yes, but we cover alot more territory than just Western Washington!

&lt;&lt;No hard feelings, eh?  I know that you have a sense of humor in there 
somewhere.
 &gt;&gt;
Never!  We always put it out with a sense of humor!  You just took it wrong.
