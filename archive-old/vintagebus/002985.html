What a pleasant surprise this weekend when so many Busketiers showed up at
the Wabonsi camp out!  Originally it was Wade and Daisy W/ Hippie bus, Keith
and family, Dan Buser and Bryant with his Colorado Splitty who said they
could come. I went down Thursday and rented  4 of the flattest and best
grassed spots in the camp ground for my beloved fellow Busketiers.  But
those who felt they could not commit, still showed up any way.  ( If you
rent it they will come!)  The first pleasant surprise was Steve Hughs With
his Philosophy, stories and his double cab. He had caravaned with Dan Buser.
The next surprise was the when caravan from Omaha showed up with Rob Lafoon
&amp; single cab w/canvas, Terry and Linda W/split window Westy &amp; The Hubcap,
Bindi and Shelby W/baywindow camper &amp; friends and Byant W/ Colorado splitty
who had caught up with them at the exit! :)  We had a fine hootenanny
Saturday night!  All weekend Busketiers enjoyed the best that the Loess
Hills had to offer in mother nature and the best that the Midwest had to
offer in people. Saturday after noon we escaped to the Swap meet in
Brownsville NE, and Sunday we escaped to ride and walk the rails to trails
Showboat trail from Nebraska City to Peru NE.  We scoffed at the people with
the five and six digit $ campers that they just sat in and watched TV and we
enjoyed every thought, smile and insight offered from the youngest (Keaton)
to the oldest in the group.  The Hub cap was the Link to the Bus world that
made the camp out seem more than just a Mid-west event. Even though Glen
Hadley couldn't be there his Westy was there (thanks Glenn) and Dan enjoyed
camping in it three nights :)  We all decided to have our pictures taken in
front of Glen's Westy since he wasn't there.  What a fine bunch of people
and lovely bunch of memories. :)

Thanks,

Kevin Sullivan
