First, I drained and refilled the RGB's and tranny.  Now both boxes are 
leaking from what looks like behind the spring plates.  Is this common for a 
bus that has sat for a long time?  Should I just drive it and refill it 
regularly or take the time and pull them apart?  What seals would be leaking? 
 Is it the plug on the back of the boxes?  Both stub axels have very littly 
play(almost none) and spin freely.  There were no chunks or filings in the 
drain plugs...just fine metal paste. I think they are in good 
condition...speedo says 87K seem about right.
Hi Steven
Well my single cab sat for about 4 years and the RGB leaks on the right side. 
 It is the plug.  I am letting it go as long as it doesn't get up inside the 
drum and contaminate the brake shoes.
&lt;&lt; Lastly, this 67 does not have back up lights.  Does that mean it is an 
early 67?? &gt;&gt;

I've owned two 67's neither with back up lights.  Both were early, one even 
had a single circuit MC
