&gt; Might be better to figure out the Bay switch, you'll be smarter when you do. 

there are a few problems with that switch. First it's quite large
(physically). Also I was unable to find any two contacts in the switch
that would actually close w/ the timer on and open w/ the timer
finished. That leads me to believe that there is a relay inside the
timer that needs power to operate. However it could simply be busted
:(
