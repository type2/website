&gt;&gt; If a Jetta is too small, then this may not work, but if you want mileage
&gt;&gt; and reasonable room, do like I did and go buy a Toyota Prius.  I get
&gt;&gt; about 42-46 highway and about 44-48 city.
&gt;
&gt;Before you get carried away on this concept, do a bit of math.  It takes a
&gt;lot of miles to reach the breakeven cost point where the fuel savings
&gt;equal the cost premium of the vehicle.  My students did a cost comparison
&gt;of the Honda hybrid versus a Honda Civic using EPA mileage numbers.  At $2
&gt;a gallon, the breakeven point was 700,000+ miles.  To get a breakeven point
&gt;of 100,000 miles the cost of fuel would have to go up to $12 a gallon.

The same calculation for the Toyota goes like this.  The Echo is most
comparable in size to the Prius - it has 2 less cubic feet of passenger
volume and 2 more cubic feet of trunk volume per the EPA.  Both cars
are 4-door and automatic.

Assumptions:

Prius  52 city  45 highway  48 combined  (EPA, www.fueleconomy_dot_gov)
Echo   32 city  38 highway  35 combined  (EPA, www.fueleconomy_dot_gov)
(EPA combined is 45% highway, 55% city)

Prius base MSRP  $20,450  (edmunds_dot_com, includes destination charge)
Echo base MSRP   $11,780  (edmunds_dot_com, includes destination charge)

Both cars take the same grade of gas at $2 a gallon 

Calculation:

Price premium $8,670

Break even, using the EPA combined numbers, is:

Price premium = ((Total miles / Echo MPG) * gas cost) - 
                ((Total miles / Prius MPG) * gas cost)

8670 = ((Total / 35) * 2) - ((Total / 48) * 2)
8670 = ((2/35) * Total) - ((1/24) * Total)
8670 = 0.0155 * Total

Total miles = 560,000

Gas cost to make a 100,000 mile breakeven is:

8670 = ((100,000 / 35) * gas) - ((100,000 / 48) * gas)
8670 = (2860 * gas) - (2080 * gas)
8670 = (774 * gas)

Gas = $11.20 / gallon

Conclusion: 

Toyota is charging less premium than Honda.  :)

Discussion:

In case you don't agree with the percentages in the EPA combined
estimates, you can get upper and lower limits for the total mileage
figure by running it with the city and highway MPGs.  This gives
361,000 miles city and 1,060,000 miles highway.  The gas cost
for 100,000 mile break-even is $7.21 city and $21.20 highway.

This analysis also assumes that the only way to recover the price
premium is in the lower gasoline cost.  In terms of money coming
directly out of your wallet this is accurate.  However, it does
not consider things like the lower greenhouse gas emissions
(per EPA, 4.0 tons/15,000 miles Prius and 5.5 tons/15,000 miles
Echo, CO2 equivalent) of 56 tons over those 560,000 miles.  This
is hard to assign a direct cost to, but it has been done, for
example with &quot;pollution credits&quot;.  (I wonder if I can get pollution
credits for driving a Prius rather than my old Ford?  Probably
not, I haven't given enough money to re-election campaigns.  :) )

&gt;Better to restore a bus, and with the money you saved from not
&gt;buying a new car take a few trips around the world!

Before you get carried away on this concept, do a bit of math.
A couple of years ago there was a thread on RAMVA about the cost
of restoring a Bug.  The answer at the time seemed to be about
$6,000, including buying the car and all parts and materials.
This also was doing most of the work yourself (it assumes your
labor is free), including rebuilding the engine, bodywork,
painting, interior, etc.  Other people on the list can better
advise what a comparable figure is for a Bus.  

Assuming you could restore a Bus for $6,000, you have saved
$5,780 over the cost of a new Echo.  (Obviously it doesn't make
any sense to buy a Prius).  Assuming that you can buy gas
everywhere in the world for the US price of $2/gal, that buys
you 2,890 gallons of gas, which at 20 mpg would take you 57,800
miles.  At the equator, this is only about 2.31 times around
the world.  At European prices of $4/gal you only get 28,900
miles, or 1.15 times around the world.  This also assumes that
you sleep in the Bus and that the boat passage you will need
to do this is free.  :)
