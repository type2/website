Subject: Interesting find  - Split Window &quot;movie&quot; bus
Message-ID: &lt;59314ab8.24357206_at_aol_dot_com&gt;

Went to see a bus today. Mid 60's split. Been inside over 30 years. No rust.
10,000 on the odm.  Original paint very shiney! Belongs to a old eccentric
who said he bought it to play his old movies?? The guy bought it in germany
and thinks VW made a &quot;movie&quot; model. Give me a break.

He has had in the family room of his very large (mansion) house all these
years and wifey making him get rid of it. He says he starts it every once in
a while to see if it runs and does fine. Who knows? The guy is pretty old.

Anyway, I bought it for cheap and gonna make a camper out of it. Anybody want
the insides? He says it all works. I will like the extra headroom.
