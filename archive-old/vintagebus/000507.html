funny enough, reading this story of trouble heading into Canada, I never 
have.   Crossed the border numbers of times, usually in a VW bus, often a 
ratty splitty looking dispreputable and same with my companion(s).   However, 
the Canadians were pleasant and polite.  Have a nice visit. they'ld say.

Those %^^$^%%^ Americans!    Once (in the bug) was not searched.  Always when 
in a bus.    Standard operating prcedure AFAICT.    They really want to bust 
us for smuggling drugs.  Unfortunately for them, That's not my line.   Got 
annoyed on one trip where we zig zagged cross the border a few times for 
various reasons, and decided to go as slobby as possible.   The officials 
looked in the bus and didn't want to go in in their starched white shirts.  
:)   Of course, I thought the dirty bits of metal in the bus were wonderful, 
guess they didn't.  One kinda tweaked the back hatch of the 61 M 130 deluxe 
trying to yank the hatch down w/o lifting the hold rod out of the stay notch. 
 Thanks.

Clara
