&gt;The bidding is _at_ $500+, but I can't see $500 worth of parts on this car, even if you cut the whole thing up and ebay'd it a piece at a time...

I've seen the roofs for $500...

If I had a really rusty but complete Deluxe, I'd get the eBay shell media blasted and transfer everything over.

&gt;&gt;IF YOU ALREADY HAVE A MICROBUS BUT IT IS NOT A DELUXE YOU COULD MAKE IT ONE WITH THE ROOF FROM THIS BUS.

No you can't!  Blasphemy!

Jeez, I hate it when people type in all caps.
