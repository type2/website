Subject: drove the truck to work

I drove the '61 Double Cab to work this morning. First time since I sold my 
'59 Kombi that I've been able to drive a Type II VW. I don't have a 4th 
gear, which sucked a little bit, but the truck did good and was a blast to 
drive. It's a nice familiar feeling.

Now, we'll see how much I like it when I go to drive home this afternoon in 
the Texas HEAT!
