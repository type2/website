Subject: 58 westy parting +link to pix
Priority: normal
X-mailer: Pegasus Mail for Win32 (v3.01d)

well I decided to part out the 58 westy(or take it whole??)
as you can see from the pix in the folowing there are lots of good 
parts remaining!!  I would prefer to sell the interior whole so that is 
could be saved and transplanted into another bus! but if there are 
no takers after a few weeks I will part that out too..I just need to get 
it all done fairly soon (like within the next month)all the important 
handles/fasteners are intact along with curiain rods and coat 
hooks..etc..
parts requests will be sold on a first come first serve basis-cameron

p.s. the bus is located in port orchard,wa
