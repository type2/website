Finally a solution to the starter problem that has dogged me since the
engine rebuild. The starter bushing I installed while the engine was out
over the winter is the culprit.
When I pulled the engine out this morning and pounded out the steel bushing
I had installed, it was all chewed up and worn out of round in the inside. I
don't know why. I installed a new brass bushing from MOFOCO, and while I had
the engine out I drained and refilled the transmission oil.
Then rolled the engine back in, buttoned it up and when I hit the key the
starter spun normally, the engine caught right away and I've started it
eight or nine times since, when the engine is hot or cold it spins and fires
just like it's brand new.
Tomorrow I'm going to change the oil in the redux boxes, and fix a problem
with the brake pedal stop which causes the brake lights to stay on. I'm not
sure if it's up to the drive to effingham next weekend, but I'll be there
bus or not.
Thanks to all list members who've offered tips and encouragement during this
problem. As soon as I put the tools away I headed into the house for a
shower and shave.
Just in case Brian's in the neighborhood.
