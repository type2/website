Subject: SW gas heater help UPDATE..

Sorry to keep beating this horse, but I don't think
it's dead yet;^)  Anyway, this SW heater I just got
has a problem, I have discovered that the heater fires
and gets god and hot at first, the thermal switch on
the side of the blower seems to function correctly
(when it gets real hot, the white plastic thingy turns
and shuts off the gas) HOWEVER after it does this a
couple of times, the gas will not come back on or
comes on in a very limited quantity (even though the
plastic thingy on the thermal switch has rotated back
to the correct position), so the heater begins to cool
off and the air never realy heats back up as it
should.
Alright guys, what part is suspect??
