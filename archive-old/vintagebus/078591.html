I had mates that used to race 2 stroke offroad bikes. They would
periodically 'decarbon' by heating the pipe as described and once it was
glowing red at one end they would blow o2 in. I was always leery of
being around when they did this but no-one ever died. The process would
release a LOT of smoke and once complete the pipes were good and clean.
