Subject: Re: [VB] Re: [T2] AridZona VW Show

Ah, called out again.

Yes I am carrying 2 jars of specially preserved cherries, homemade by Ted 
himself. Wife and I both sampled one at Ted's shop.. Kinda make you wish for 
a beer to chase it down with. Ted said it takes about a week to have them 
fully cured, so all of them are still happily swimming around in the jars. 
Hope I make it there to present the punchy little greetings from Cincinnati!

On top of that I would like to donate something small but interesting for 
raffle or for auction - an aircooled VW beads from Mardi Gras. Nothing big, 
but was not an easy find (we combed thru the French Market with no score, but 
found it eventually.) It has 2 splitties and 2 bugs in the beads. Sorry, no 
pics at this time, but it is pretty cool. No GEX engines in any of the 4 
cars! ;-)
