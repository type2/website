Your problem is the rust is in the *metal*; it's not as simple as polishing
out faded paint.  The paint film has been compromised and must be replaced.
There are lots of ways to deal with the rust, but unless you want the sysyphian 
task of doing it over and over and over, you *will* have to throw down with 
new paint on the areas you treat.

&gt; I just picked up a low mileage Euro Single (white) that all in all is in

&gt; like to sand, blast, rub, whatever the rust down and or remove some of
&gt; it. Any ideas???
