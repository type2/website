&gt; Just seems foolish to schedule an event in same

Just FYI, this is the SIXTH Annual BnB campout, I am
not even sure that the Michigan show was the same
weekend when this show began way back in 2000. 
Anyway, the OVT campout has always been the Weekend
before Memorial Day, mostly because of renting
camground space for exclusive use is impossible after
Memorial Day, and Ohio earlier in the season is too
unpredictable! So, you may say its foolish, but thats
your opinion, I assure you the dates were well thought
out and have been consistent since 2000!  Maybe I
should be upset that they scheduled that show the same
weekend as ours!! (just kidding ;^)
Anyway, if you like shows go to Michigan, if you like
camping and canoeing come to BnB!!

&quot;So we got into the red VW microbus with the shovels and the rakes and the implements of destruction and we headed on to the police officer's station...&quot;
