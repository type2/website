I just got back from another great VW swap in KC.  This time I picked up 
several near mint pieces of dealer litureature - all of it type 2, nothing 
newer than '61 or '62, most of it is from the 50's (no barndoor stuff though) 
 Can anyone out there give me some help putting a market value to this stuff? 
 ..hoping I didn't pay too much, but it was in such great shape I couldn't 
resist (Yes, it is original, no repops)

Thanks,
Dan
