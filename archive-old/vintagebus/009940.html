GAS PRICES TO HIT $3 A GALLON

DINA TEMPLE-RASTON, USA TODAY :

by regional company representatives to get ready for the possibility of
$3-a-gallon gasoline this summer.

Bob Oyster, who owns 26 Shell and Chevron service stations in Northern
California, says representatives from both companies told him to &quot;be
prepared for $3 gasoline the early part of the summer&quot;.
