&gt;Just some input, we have a 1997 chevy silverado pick up, z-71, etc etc, all 
&gt;the works, : 29 mpg highway (pulling an 18' trailor with a 20'x4'x3' bin 
&gt;(for soybeans)going from Pittsburg to York Pa., over all the mountains, etc. 
&gt;And, it gets 32 highway, without the trailor. this is 100% true, (its an 
&gt;automatic) we have measured the gas mileage 6 times.

Maybe you got a really good pickup but I find this really hard to believe.
I drove an '85 GMC 1500 for a while, 305 v8, stock Rochester carb, and it
would get 15 to 20 mpg empty.  The archived EPA estimates at
http://www.fueleconomy_dot_gov/feg/findacar.htm don't have the &quot;Silverado&quot;
name, but show estimates all around 15 city/20 highway for the 2wd gas
V8 1500 and 2500 models.  Of course these estimates are the classic source
of &quot;your mileage may vary&quot; but I find it hard to believe that you are
getting around 50% better than the EPA ratings.

Bus content?  Well, it's Friday in Germany...let's see, though...here are
the numbers I get for the grandchildren and great-grandchildren of our
splitties...

'85 Vanagon, 1.9L 4 speed, 18/20
'91 Vanagon, 2.1L 4 speed, 18/19
'93 Eurovan, 2.5L 5 speed, 17/21
'01 Eurovan, 2.8L auto, 17/20
