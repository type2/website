&lt;&lt; -where do they mount (in the bead?)&gt;&gt;
Hi Pete,
Correct!

&lt;&lt;-do i need to mount them when I get my tires mounted at the tire shop?&gt;&gt;
Yes!

&lt;&lt;-If so, will a tire shop install them for me? &gt;&gt;
Hopefully!  They are really a pain, and often one, or another fall off.  You 
might instead find out if there is a paint that would do the same trick.  
That way you could do it yourself, and retouch them when needed.  Eric&amp;Barb
