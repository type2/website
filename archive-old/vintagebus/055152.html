Subject: Re: [VB] Sunroof Barndoor Kombi special?

. Not too long ago
&gt; there was a decent barndoor on the samba for 7k that
&gt; was way more complete and restorable.

There still is!
Its mine....will be at pomona if I find a trailer.....

I think 4K for that bus is CHEAP.
I've only ever seen/heard about 3 barndoor standard or Kombi sunroofs.
ROTR!!!!!!

&gt; Here's my two cents.
&gt; Four grand for that is way too much. Not too long ago
&gt; there was a decent barndoor on the samba for 7k that
&gt; was way more complete and restorable. I would love a
&gt; brandoor but they are pretty expensive. have you
&gt; priced a 23 window lately? How about a middle seat?
&gt; Ambulance fan?ect ect ect
