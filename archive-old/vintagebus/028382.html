&gt;&gt;In a message dated 3/23/01 8:39:15 AM Pacific Standard Time, thom_at_calweb_dot_com 
&gt;&gt;writes:
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Why are all the early parts &quot;ribbed&quot; or &quot;grooved&quot; ie bumpers, inner 
&gt;&gt; door handles, semaphores, etc.   Is there some Freudian gag that
&gt;&gt; we missed?
&gt;
&gt;Probably for the same reason they call the 55-61 blinky front turn signals 
&gt;&quot;nipples&quot;.

We do, here in the puritanical States (you know, where somebody shooting 
someone on prime-time network TV is OK but two people making love is
not), but in Germany, they just call those &quot;wart blinkers&quot;.  (The later
ones are &quot;frog eyes&quot; or &quot;fish eyes&quot;).

&gt;Though it seems like the guys don't like to use grease when 
&gt;assembling things, they just don't understand the importance of lube.
&gt;(ok, who's blushing?)

Not me...as someone I know once said, &quot;when the lube is dripping from the
ceiling, you've used *almost* enough...&quot;
