Subject: Re: [VB] Tom Conners' Roof Racks!

&lt;&lt;you can actually get up on the rack and lounge?&gt;&gt;

Yes!... Tom told me 350 lbs.  But I've had my 190lbs up there moving
stuff around and felt stable.  I didn't get his ladder yet.  I step on
the hinge on the left cargo door with my toe and pull up.  Then just jump
off.  I only sit up there at the beach, so the sand takes the fall.
