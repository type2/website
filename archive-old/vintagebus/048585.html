&gt;30 buses and only one driver? Volkswagens want to be driven every day.
&gt; Sounds like 29 buses with a lot of down time. the karma on that smells a bit
&gt;funky to me.

But if I hadn't saved them, there would be no karma at all!!  Which is
better, a bus resting under a roof, nice and dry, or a bus crushed down to
3 feet square?  You decide.
