Well, yes and no.  I knew how to drive since I was about 10? or so....I really
started driving a lot when I was 15.  I used my mom's Pont!ac Gr_at_nd Pr!x to drive
around then though.  I got my first car and first bus (Stella - 71 weekender) when I
was 15... 2 months before I even got my license.  I knew how to drive stick already
when I got her, so that was helpful.  But, that was MY first car.  All I've ever
owned are buses, and the 71 is the 'newest' one yet.  I towed it home and worked on
it for quite a while out in the driveway to get her roadworthy... a great learning
experience, really.  Now of course I've driven other vehicles and borrowed the
parent's cars... but those aren't my daily drivers.  I currently drive Stella about
60-70 miles/day....and thats back and forth to school.  (No, not a private school or
anything...I just hate this town's schools...so I went to a different one...from
where I used to live...and grew up)  But...I'm done with that as of January 11th!
Wahoo!!  Watch out all you PNW folks, I'm headed your way!!!

Anyways...I don't know if that answered Scott's question, more or less a little
rambling of mine.  Good thing its friday.

Last campout of the year this weekend!  Should be a hoot!  Last year we had some
snow...

Well...anyways...
Later,
Isaiah
