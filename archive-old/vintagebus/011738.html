The

scrub a high-quality metallic-based anti-sieze compound into the

Fire?  Me?  Never!

A few years back I would have agreed with you, Bob.  I never
lubricated the splines on the mainshaft beyond whatever oil film was
left when I wiped the shaft prior to assembly.

What changed my mind was acquiring a BMW motorcycle.  Beemers have a
reputation for reliability that appeals to folks like myself.  My
R100RT touring bike went 114,000 miles before it needed a valve job. 
The cylinders and bottom end were still in &quot;like new&quot; condition.

While getting the heads back from my local BMW shop (which is a
holdover from the past, with parts people who actually know what they
are talking about), the parts lady asked &quot;have you checked your
transmission splines?&quot;  I hadn't, but since the bike was mostly apart
I went ahead and checked them.  There was definite wear in the input
shaft splines (which are configured in automotive fashion)  Seems that
unlubricated splines are subject to &quot;fretting&quot; wear caused by
microscopic reciprocating movement between the hub and shaft splines. 
The BMW service bulletin that addressed this problem suggested that
the splines be greased at 30,000 mile intervals.  This problem would
never have shown up on an ordinary motorcycle, since very few of them
see 100K miles.

Since I consider my VWs to be &quot;forever cars&quot;, It seems prudent to
lubricate the splines sparingly whenever the engine is out.  At the
least it will prevent the shaft from sticking to the disk, and there
is the possibility that it might reduce mainshaft wear as well.  

My choice of distributor point grease is due to its high viscosity. 
Anti-sieze would probably work as well, but I'm fearful that this
relatively thin grease would get onto the clutch disk.
