I just inherited an inexpensive &quot;floor jack&quot; (on four casters, you pump up 
and down, the small hydraulic cylinder pushes against a parallelogram, 
other end goes up, screw-type release valve) that doesn't work.  My source 
said it did work until very recently, can't be bothered fixing it.

Well, I'm not proud.  I added some oil.  Still no go.  Can anyone advise on 
the theory of operation one one of these?

OVWBC:  I'm going to use it to jack up my '67 standard so I can get to 
work.
