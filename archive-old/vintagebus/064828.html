Subject: barndoor deluxe in factory primer?

In this months Hot VWs in the Collector's Corner (Rich Kimball) there is a mention of a Barndoor Deluxe that is &quot;delivered in factory primer&quot; What is up with that? Is it a found in a barn mint condition original special order find of a lifetime or is it a restored special order bus. After searching Everett's gallery a found a few pics of it but no mention of it being factory primer.

Any of you that went to the OCTO/Classic have any info on it?



Thanks,

Brian
