&gt; I'm blowing a lot of oil and air out my breather tube and oil filler when
open. Compression is good on 3 cyl., one is 15 lbs. low. Power is good. Karl
sez it's time for new rings. I don't know the mileage on this 1776cc with an
Engle 100 cam and large dellortos and want to drive it the 8 hours to Lake
Havasu in 10 days. Any insight, psychic or otherwise? Guess I'll tear it
down and be prepared for rings or p &amp; c's this weekend.
&gt;

Just go into it planning on doing the P/C's. You can't re-ring VW engines.
Well, you can physically, but what a waste of time. Do the rod bearings as
long as you're that far in. This is what I call the 'Presidential' rebuild.
Private joke. Anyway, it goes like this:
Pull the engine and strip it down.
Remove pistons and cylinders and rods.
Check endplay and adjust as necessary.
Get size for rod bearings and head to the parts house. Get the P/C's, rod
bearings, push rod tubes, all new exhaust valves, a flywheel seal and a
gasket kit.
Go back to the house, remove the rings from the pistons and install the rod
bearings and rods while someone else washes the pistons and cylinders. Give
the cylinders a light shot of black lacquer and start installing them
according to Hoyle, Hoover, Fisher, et al. Start drinking heavily as you
start torqueing the heads and then remember that you were going to replace
the exhaust valves and besides you forgot to put on the pushrod tubes. Good.
Go ahead and torque them to 7 lbs and leave them on overnight. This would be
a good time to start on that Type IV cooler conversion while the cylinder
sealant is drying. Get the cylinder tin to seal up good, fit the fan shroud
and fit it up to seal good too, then start cutting and welding the doghouse
to fit around the cooler. Continue drinking on into the evening. Wake up
early in the morning, pop the heads (careful not to disturb the jugs), pull
the old exhaust valves, lap the new ones in and install the heads and
pushrod tubes and torque everything up the Muir way. Set the valves and then
re-install it in the bus. Fill her up with the sorriest grocery store brand
of non-Pennsylvania oil you can find, hook everything back up but the coil
wire, crank til the oil light goes out, hook it up and light it off. Scream
it like Ellis' newborn for a few and then settle down and see what you got.
Drive it fifty or a hundred miles then dump the oil and refill with your
personal favorite. This is not a rebuild, but it does extend the motor a few
years for under $200 and the new exhaust valves are cheap insurance that
your new P/C's won't grenade in a hundred miles. YMMV
