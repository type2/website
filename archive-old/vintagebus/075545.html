&gt;
&gt;At the 2003 Bad Camberg I bought a beautiful NOS switch, but it turns out
&gt;that it is a European spec. Bus switch without a terminal #57 and with two
&gt;terminal #30.  Anyone know if it can be easily converted or wired up
&gt;to function like a USA spec. switch?

If you connect the wire that went to 57 on your US-spec switch to 58 on
the Euro-spec switch, the parking lights will work, but they won't turn
off with the headlights.

You could probably make the US-spec switch work like a Euro-spec one by
adding a relay.  Coil positive to 58, coil negative to 56, common contact
to 30, normally open contact for the wire that went to 57.  In &quot;park&quot; the
relay coil is powered by the rear parking light circuit and grounds through
the headlight bulbs.  In &quot;headlight&quot; it's still powered but loses its
ground and turns off.  Or, if you have a relay with a normally-closed
contact: coil positive to 56, coil negative to ground, common contact to
58, normally closed contact for the wire that went to 57.  This connects
57 to the rear parking light circuit, except when the headlights are on.

Given that you're asking for NOS, you'll probably need a 6 V relay.
These are a little hard to find new; the hazard relay from a '63-'65
US-spec Bus will work.

You might be able to do it without a relay if you can figure out how to
isolate the grounds on the parking light sockets in the headlight buckets.
Connect the 57 wire to 58 at the switch, and connect the ground wire
from the parking light socket to the low beam wire.  This grounds the
parking light through the headlight, making it turn off when the
headlights are on.
