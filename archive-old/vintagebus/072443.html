Subject: Re: [VB] Hippies- One last clarification, it wasn't them!!

&gt; I *personally* know x-hippies who *borrowed* the tools
&gt; to cut the wheel arches on their own buses.  When you're
&gt; driving all over the country for whatever reason, it's
&gt; nice to have a little high crusing speed.

you said &quot;High Cruising&quot; dude huh huhuh huh


well actually crusing but Im making a leap of faith
