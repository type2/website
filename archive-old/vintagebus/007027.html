Subject: The $700 brake repair, one more point... having stuff on hand
Date: Fri, 28 Jul 2000 20:34:26 -0700

I guess one big point I was thinking but didn't articulate... having a
professional do it has one real advantage -- they have great tools and
hopefully all the parts on hand.  I hate NOTHING MORE than starting
something like a brake job, breaking a bolt or who knows what -- then not
being able to get the part.

After doing this again... and again... I dumped a lot of money into
purchasing extra parts, just in case... a lot of this was because I could
only do work on weekends and at night -- and finding a part I needed on
Saturday really sucked.

Yes, there are shops who screw you -- say it will be 1 day when it takes 8,
charge you too much -- but a GOOD shop has the advantage of on-hand parts
and good tools that is very hard to duplicate.  It isn't just skills and
experience...

Of course, having friends (list members) like ThomF or Steven Howell who
have lots of good tools and parts also works too.  Especially something like
brakes where you can likely drive it there.  A botched engine install...
well then you ask Steven Howell to drive his motorcycle to your house (45
minutes 1 way)!

The list is the best resource, better than any shop!  It is like having 5
shops!

If everything were perfect in the first place, routine
brake maintenance is within grasp of a novice --

Agreed, then again it took me 18 months of constant
repairs to get my 63 EZ camper stable. It about drove
me nuts. EVERY weekend both days doing and redoing
each system until I got all new parts. Clooging on the
cheap sucks dick. I suggested the do it your damned
self method because that is the budget that I have
been on since Adam was a puppy... Yeah, having
everyone else do your work for you works great as long
as you have a choice.
