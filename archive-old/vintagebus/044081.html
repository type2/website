&gt; &lt;&lt; Question; When did VW change from the thick to the thin cargo door 
&gt; latch  rods? I am not talking about the early ones with the notch, but 
&gt; the later  ones with the screw that holds them to the latch. When going 
&gt; through a pile  of them I have, I noticed 2 different thicknesses of 
&gt; these rods and have  never noticed this before! Parts book demons&gt;start 
&gt; your fingers walking. 

Something timely on the list as always.......I was looking at a similar 
subject last night. I have a pair of panel van cargo doors - 211 841 
081C and 211 841 091C. I checked my parts list and it said from chassis 
no. 705 620 (Dec '60) to 1 019 924 (Oct '62) The next revision listed 
for these part numbers was F - which said for 'reinforced locking bars' 

Does this mean that the locking bars (latch rods) changed in '62? What 
happened to D and E part number revisions?

Thanks for any insight.
