Subject: Re: [VB] New List Ebay Policy - Please Read
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

I dont mind listening to it.
I dont have the time to search ebay night and day, sometimes its nice when 
people point out the &quot;cool&quot; items.
And besides, dragging the email from one side window to the delete key isnt 
all that tough.
Most of the time, you do it with 99% of the list traffic.
And if its *THAT* bad, there is always the idea of unsub'ing to the list!

&lt;&lt;Before we get into a long-winded debate over wether we should allow
ebay posting or not...

There has to be a happy medium.  Granted, most of the people here *do*
surf ebay, and are familiar with what's out there.  So it's not necessary
to post long lists of stuff you find out there.  Most of it just isn't
that interesting.

But, there are some things are are interesting on ebay, and I feel it's 
important
for them to be discussed for the broadening of the knowledge base.  The
dual generator stand is a perfect example.  This was a part that is not
seen very often, and the discussion of the details of it's uses 
were generally helpful to the list populace.  Even if most of us will never
own the bus  (or bug) that that went to, it's a good piece of knowlege to
have.  Now if you just happen across one at a swap meet for $5, you know
to grab it...

If you come across a bus part on ebay, and have questions as to it's 
application to your bus or authenticity - this seems to be especially 
critical when it
comes to purported &quot;barndoor&quot; parts - by all means post and ask.  With eBay,
knowlege is more important than money - there's shysters all over the place
trying to take your money by misrepesenting parts.

But don't flood the list with every used voltage regulator and bumper
bracket that comes up FA.
