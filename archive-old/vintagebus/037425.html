Hi Lee,
Sure we have one of those.  How about 271 941 205 and what is the difference 
between it and the &quot;A&quot; model?  Or 241 857 513, or 244 857 521, and why are 
they left and right only when all of the others we have delt with are either 
side items?  There also is 211 857 551, and 221 857 551.  Has anyone seen any 
of these?
