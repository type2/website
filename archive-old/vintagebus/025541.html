Hi - I'm having trouble with the front brakes on my 67 westy. The stopping power is way down in front, pads and adjustment ok, so I went to bleed the system because they do better with pumping. When I went to bleed the front, the flow seemed restricted on both front cylinders regardless of bleeder screw looseness or pedal pressure, not much fluid came out at all with each stroke. Could the &quot;front brake&quot;part of the master be bad and the back-part be fine? Could it be the braided steel
lines in front?
Now no matter how many times I bleed the system the pedal goes way down.
