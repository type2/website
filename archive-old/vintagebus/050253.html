Subject: [VB] VW Historical Dealer Calender
Message-Id: &lt;v04011700b47aff99e8e9_at_[192.168.0.9]&gt;

Unfortunatly I don't have a VW dealer near me. Is there any way someone who
plans to get a historical calender from the dealer could pick an extra up
and mail it to me? If your game, let me know via pmail. I'll send you the
$$$ for the calender and shipping as soon as I know how much. TIA.
