Subject: non-Bentley manual for older buses
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

I remebered to look at the English shop manual for
older buses that I mentioned a few days ago.  Here is
what I found on it- my copy is hardbound with a
plastic finish on the covers.
The title is &quot;Workshop Manual for the Volkswagen 1200,
1500 Transporter 1954-67&quot;, by Keneth Ball, Autopress
LTD, Brighton, England, copyright 1970.  It is one of
the &quot;Autobook&quot; series of workshop manuals.  It is 161
pages long, including index and list of other manuals
in the series- about 150 pages or so of actual bus
related text.  The transmission chapter has a couple
of pages on non-synchro trannies, 5 pages on 3-synchro
trannies, and 6 pages on tunnel case 4 synchro
trannies.
Hope that this helps someone.  I have seen softcover
(paperback) copies of this, not xeroxes, but I can't
recall where I saw them.
According to the original receipt that I found in the 
book, it cost $7.95 in 1971.  I got it in a used book
store in the 1980's.
