 Things that happen to a VW Bus...That you have to

&lt;&lt;there was no leaking until I pulled the drum off. 
What does this say to you?  I'm not sure if it goes
away when the drum is torqued back on or if I should
be hunting around for a new seal rebuilt kit 6 days
before I drive to MT. 
&gt;&gt; 
Hi Adam, 
Retorque the drum back on and it will press the spacer
that rides inside the axle seal inwards against the
O-ring you put on the stub axle before you installed
the axles seal and the inner spacer.  DEFINITELY get
two axle seal rebuild kits for the road spares.

File...Or the buyer beware list.....
I flew to LA to pick up my '64 Sundial, which the
seller assured me was in fine running condition and in
plenty good shape to drive back to Hood CA. He even
took it to an LA VW mechanic for a tuneup and lube.
The mechanic didn't see anything amiss. I drove it
around LA a bit, and indeed it seemed just fine.
Compression, oil pressure, etc. was all good, and I
thought I had nothing to worry about. But less than
100 miles outside LA disaster struck: rod through the
case. Why? When I finally got the bus home (trailer)
and started tearing into the deceased engine, I found
the spaces between cylinders to be just packed tight
with a hardened mixture of motor oil and sand.
Rust-free desert bus, you see. Had I trailered the bus
home in the first place I could have saved that
engine. I had a hellish journey home (hitch-hiking in
USA just plain sucks) and wouldn't wish that upon
anybody. Good luck Joel.........Thanks Joel...Mark
here....Moral of the story? Have the bus X-rayed
before purchase of course!! Pay close attention to
X-Rays of camper types and Carry-Your-Potties..
 ..... I am no expert...Thats for sure!!!!!!Is there a
list of things to &quot;Watch Out For&quot; in the files
somewhere? Sounds like a good idea to me to have a
handy printout for newbies(to list and Bus care) like
me....Any ideas? Want to add to list?...Fix
list?..Forget list?.Have a better list?(I
hope!)...Ok...I'll go sit in the corner now.....
