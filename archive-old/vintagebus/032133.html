Subject: more roofrack questions
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

I picked up the 2 racks I've been woorking out a deal on...
1 is a 13 slat, sloped, sub-hatch rack...
The other 1 is a 13 slat more common pop-top rack...
They're restored...

question 1?
The wood is stained and new... I would like to put a &quot;clear&quot; type finish over 
them to protect them from the elements. Should I put a gloss, semi-gloss, or 
satin finish on these and what is a good wood sealer type clear?

question two?
Where should the tags be placed and with what (brass nail is what Greg Noble 
told me... thanks Greg!)... On the outside, side of the outer slats I 
suppose, but, where...
ie. measurements etc.

Also, can you run ambo fans on 12v? I've got my set of chrome ones I want to 
install in a while (I'll prob be asking for wiring help later!)

Thanks!,
Pete
