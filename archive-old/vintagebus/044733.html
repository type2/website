Yes, there IS a difference between Turn signal switches.  I ran into this
when I was resurrecting the Tinkertoy.  After ordering a couple switches
&gt;from various vendors I finally did my very best to clean the contacts in
my existing switch.  It now works really good except right rear turn
signal is a tad hard to find.  I saw little difference between the 2
switches, just a couple extra wires soldered to the 12V/1967 switch.  I
wonder if there's a listee out there clever enough with free electrons
running along the outer surface of a conductor to figure out the
difference and let the world know how simple it is to fix 6V switches to
fit a 67 Bus!

After all this typing I realized you were asking about HEADLIGHT switches
and not turn signal switches.  Oh well, my question still stands!

6V or 12V doesn't matter for the switches.  The 66/67 turn sgnal switch is
differet as the high beams are activated there, so the 66 turn signal switch
is not the same as a 65 one.
