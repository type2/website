Subject: Re: [VB] pulley leak

Hi JT,

Leaks at the pulley can be from several causes.

First, the oil slinger must be installed facing the correct direction.

Second, oil level must not be overfull.

Third, excessive blowby can force oil out.

In my case, a high compression engine build was aided by installing
the bugpack oil breather system. This reduced 95% of my oil loss
through the pulley.

A worn pulley can allow more than usual oil loss because the reverse
screw becomes less effective.

Installation of a &quot;sand seal&quot; can help here. If you have an aluminum
degree wheel pulley, it must be sleeved with steel to prevent the seal
from wearing out the pulley.

 Got an oil leak at the pulley, and am on the second pulley.  First was a
 used original, second was a used degree pulley/  I'm sure I know the answer,
 but, what is the recommended best hold in the oil pulley or method to make
 the oil stay in?  Please don't explain the PFM way the pulley keeps the oil
 in.
