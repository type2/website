Subject: Makes me want to puck/friday rant

  &quot; The VW bus was never just a means of transport, it has always been a
emotive cult object &quot;  A quote of Dr. Pischetsrieder, cotb of VW AG.
   It's looks like VW is playing with the true enthusiast, using what we
have been doing for years to justify and promote the next ugliest VW after
the 411, maybe they should reclassify the NEW MICROBUS the 911 model!!!! 
   Now if they would only support the ones that created  &quot;THE CULT&quot;


ronnie

ps. microbus is now recognized in spell check, is microsoft in bed with VW
now!!!
