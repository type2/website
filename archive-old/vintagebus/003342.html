VW buses! VW technical info. VW stories and experiences. VW help and advice. VW restoration. VW clubs and shows. VW friends. VW ebaying. VW parts swapping. VW road trips. This stuff is awesome! I love it - this is what makes this list so great! But politics? Please! We may all have our own (and different) views as to how this world is run (among other things), but besides all that, aren't we talkin' about VWs here?

Just my opinion :-)

&gt; Sonds like a free counrty all right.  Ever notice how rarely you hear the
&gt; expression &quot;It's a free county!&quot; anymore?  On some level, most people know
&gt; that their freedom has been lost.

&gt; Or outlaw everything, and then they can act like they're doing you a favor
&gt; when you are permitted to do anything.  That was once called
&gt; 'totalitarianism', but I guess that word is out of fashion now.

&gt; This is the scariest thing of all.  When others get to decide what offends
&gt; them, and then use the force of government to stop you from carrying on
&gt; your 'offensive' behavior, then you are no longer free.  Just like the
&gt; speech codes on college campuses.

&gt; Had enough of being ruled by others?  Want to begin to regain lost
&gt; freedoms?  Check out the Libertarian Party at http://www.lp_dot_org, and the
&gt; Harry Browne for President campaign at http://www.harrybrowne2000_dot_org/.
