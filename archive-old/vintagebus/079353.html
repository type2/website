Subject: Re: [VB] (bad leak) too much oil?

Is the bus on a slant?... I suspect so cause you said the oil ran 2 feet down 
the drive...If the nose of teh bus if pointed up it'll look like there's more 
oil in it than there is. check with oil with the bus on the flat for a more 
accurate reading.

Odds are the main seal is old, and it's just time to replace it.  IMOPBO oil 
cooler seals should be replaced if  the main seal is getting replaced..

I got my 67 bus (H case 1500 all-stock i.e. no
sump,filter etc.) tuned at the local aircooled shop 2
weeks ago.
A reputable place.
Drove it 90 miles total to OCTO and back, that's it.
Looked outside the other day and there's an oil
puddle, looks like about 12 to 16 FL. oz. of oil,
leaked enough to make about a 10-inch wide stain, and
run about 2-feet down the drive way. It looks like
it's leaking from between the engine and tranny. I
smelled it, it smells more like engine than tranny
oil, so I checked the dipstick and the oil line is
about 1/2 inch above the top (second) line on the
dipstick. 
Is that too much oil? How would that happpen? And do
you think it resulted in the blown main seal?
Should I be pointing fingers, or writing checks?
