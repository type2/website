Subject: re:westy interior

it's a 65 microbus that I found here in dallas when I was looking for a
camper. I kept running into the owner and looked at it. It had zero
rust, the interior was gone, and another freind gave me a z-bed that he
found in a pile of junk, so I bought it for $700 with a couple of bad
cylinders. So I decided to make my own camper. I am not sure what year
z-bed that is in there. The seat is that yellowish color and it looks
like what I have seen from the  sixties , early seventies camper seats.
The seat does have the westy serial number plate on it; can I decode it?
Otherwise I can only guess it is from a SO-42.   Is there a difference
in size for the different year z-beds throughout the years that they
used that yellow naugahide stuff; can I use a early bay window bus
closet. Thanks for the picture sites , I am starting to get a better
idea what it is going to take if I make it.
