Hello Everyone

    On the Idle of the bus has anyone mention that the carb might have one
of those Idle sensors on the side of the carb the plugs onto the coil. Sorry
if this has been mentioned already. I had this problem with my bus not
idling due to the connection from the sensor to the coil it had a bad
connection. My carb is a Pict 30/31 the sensor was on the left side closet
to the Coil.
