hello everyone,

Still trying to figure out what in the world PO of my bus did with the 
headlights.  Originally, my dad was helping me with the bus one day, and I 
asked him to take the headlights off for me.  I wanted to take advantage of 
free help while I had it, so I had him take them off while I was doing 
something else.  Consequently, I didn't get a good hard look at the 
headlights until I took them out of the bag for a look last night.  First 
off, the buckets do not appear to be a matched pair.  Stamped on the back of 
the buckets, on the inside side (imagine the bus looking at you cross eyed, 
the numbers are where the eye would be looking) there are 2 part numbers, 
one started with a &quot;113&quot; and then the number below was a &quot;211&quot; numbers.  I 
didn't write down the numbers (doh!) but I remember that they ended in 
&quot;037A&quot; and &quot;037B&quot; which leads me to believe that the buckets are left and 
right set.

However, the cut outs for the parking lights are not in the same place on 
the two buckets.  One of them is more forward (FIF) than the other.
Next strange occurance, on the headlight rings, one of them has adjusting 
screws at around 2 and 7 o'clock, and the other has the adjusting screws at 
7 and 10 o'clock.    Both of the buckets have been &quot;fitted&quot; with sylvania 
halogen sealed beam assemblies with sheet metal screws and the like, and the 
headlight rings have been painted black.  Ugly, ugly, ugly.

First off, can anyone out there help me identify what I have here?  I have a 
sneaking suspicion that it is probably a mish-mash symphony of type I and 
type II parts.

Second, and the answer to this question makes question #1 irrelevant, Who 
has the best deal on complete headlight assemblies?  i'm thinking it's time 
to chuck the nasty ones and start afresh.  Euro spec or american spec it 
doesn't matter.

TIA,

Mike Anderson
