I'm not a big proponent of S*TO, but the did have one hell of a nice shirt (white though) at their last CA event.  It had a post 61 pearl white double cab (3/4 front pose) on the back.  I had to have one.  

I wear it descreatly though :-|

&gt;I've looked at every website and catalog and magazine
&gt;I could find, and haven't found what I want yet.
&gt;I'd like to find a nice tee shirt with a realistic
&gt;splitty double cab on it--no cartoonish
&gt;caricatures--and I'd prefer it to be a colored shirt
&gt;
Izzy's used to have a cool blue shirt with a Double Cab...

Their web site address escapes me, for the moment.

Everett
