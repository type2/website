&gt; What was the original color of the cargo door check strap mounting bracket
&gt; that screws into the cargo door?  Black?  Color of the lower portion of the
&gt; Bus?  Different for early Westies?  I'm at that point with the Westy and
&gt; inquiring minds need to know.

Just looked at my '67 Westy (feel's so good to say that) and the bracket on
the door is black and the strap is green, both worn and faded and orginal.
The inside bracket with the removable pin is the color of the interior.

If it's worth doing, it's worth doing
yourself.
