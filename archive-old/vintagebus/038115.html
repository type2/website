Hi everyone,
I think that the time involved in putting something like this together is
pretty long, but it's gotta be the funniest thing I've read on friday's in a
long time.
When I got my 63 deluxe, it had about 10 of those M-codes VW forgot.
But I've seen just about everyone on other busses in my time.
Gotta love them all
