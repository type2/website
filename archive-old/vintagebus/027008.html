Subject: Roof Rack #

Anyone know what a roof rack with this number is for specifically?
ZVW153204

Is there a web sight that has Roof Rack info
like the Tent one which is awesome! And speaking of Tents I would like
to thank a list member for selling me his
at a great price, we will use it and take care of it with Love just like
we do our busses, sorry to those I scared when you thought I wanted to
use it for a Kennel :-)

Looking forward to seeing all you Moonies this weekend on Edisto Island!

As usual, thanks to all who read my post!

Meredith
