Subject: Re: Drag Link Question

You only need to ream the center pin bushing if you replace it. I have the reamer and vintagebus_dot_com has a write-up showing how to do it. It's not that hard at all but you have to remover your front shift linkage (I think) in order to ream it. 
Having someone turn the wheel as you look at it to see if it moves up and down is how you determine if it needs to be replaced.
