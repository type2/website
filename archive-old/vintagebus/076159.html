Subject: RE: [VB] Re: The Empi Truck

&gt;If you don't like the price, don't respond to the ad.  Either the price
&gt;will drop (or be mentioned) or it will sell.

It'll sell. You can count on it. And he'll get a good sum of cash for 
it too. Nothing wrong with it. Wish I was the one who found it for 
nothing. I wouldn't sell it though. I'd keep it with all my other 
basket case busses.

&quot;gonna fix up that truck one of these days&quot;

At least the deep pockets who do by it will actually fix it and put 
it back on the road. Look for it to be in the mags 3-4 years from now.
