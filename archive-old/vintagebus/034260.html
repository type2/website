I don't believe the legal issue is that big a deal, someone developed the
3.44 R&amp;P and the .77th 4th.

I think &quot;too small a market to justify expense&quot; is likely contributor to
reason.  Producing catalogs, stocking, production, explaining people what a
product is for all add cost to an aftermarket product...

4.  Legal problems.  If one of your new axles or gears were installed 
incorrectly so it failed and everyone onboard that bus was injured or killed

you would have to deal with law suits galore even though it was not your 
fault that it was installed incorrectly!   Eric&amp;Barb
