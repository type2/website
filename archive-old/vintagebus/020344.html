&gt; Tell Everett high for me, I hope you don't have to
&gt; do a tranny swap, he does
&gt; have one though!!!!

Ronnie, you keep sending me these people!  Actually, I
was glad to help him.  He's on his way (I hope) w/ a
fresh clutch.  Apparently, he &quot;adjusted&quot; the pressure
plate assembly ala Gene Berg, and lost some of the
pressure or something.  His clutch disc was very
glazed, but only on the outer 1/3 of the friction
material.

As he was finishing up, we thought of a good question
for a Friday topic. How many of us (I have) have left
our vice grips on the clutch cable after an
adjustment?
I you're embarrassed to tell the list, p-mail me, and
I'll just post a number to the list!
