Importance: Normal


1) rear camber. Wheels point in at top visibly. I assume this is spring
plate adjustment? Might also be the wrong bearing covers the DPO used,
getting to that real soon. No I am not driving her, wish I was/could. Rear
config is Type II 68 trans, with stock wheels 195s and adapters. Type II
brakes.
2) Front axle, the trailing arms of the tubes appear rubbed at front by the
nuts. Is intense toe in at each side a possibility? the tires are 14 195s on
stock rims. Is this rubbing a issue with lowered spindles? I havne't pulled
front tires yet, taking some vacation to play with her soon. The brake hose
bracket appears to be tie wrapped to the steering arm on the spindle.....I
am assuming this is not correct for the lowered spindles.
Any help is appreciated....
Al
