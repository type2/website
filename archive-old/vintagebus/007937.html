Subject: Some measurements for you to chaw on.

Well gang, I spent a few hours in the garage tonight and double checked all
my measurements.  I got the cc's within 1 cc of the previous measurement so
I'm going with the first set of measurements because there was no residual
water in the heads and by virtue of the fact I lost 1cc instead of gaining.
The first shot must have been the most accurate.

Here are the cc measurements for the heads:

#1 - 49.5cc
#2 - 53cc
#3 - 54.5cc
#4 - 54cc

Looks like #1 will take some hogging to bring it up to where it needs to be.
I also pulled off all the cylinders and measured their length and they are
all a solid 4.430&quot; long.  Each cylinder was checked 5 to 10 times and this
was by far the number that came up the most often on the calipers.  This
points to either a rottenly machined case or rods of different length as the
culprit in my mismatched deck heights.  I absolutely refuse to tear the
engine apart at this point to check rod lengths and all that crap.  I wished
I had known about this before - I could have measured the rods and and did a
test fit of the cylinders and case halves and set all this up before the
final case mating.  Kind of stupid to tear it all apart now to chase after
thousandths of an inch when the factory doesn't even strive to get this
close.

Oh well - considering how bad things have gone so far, I should expect it.
