Subject: Re: [VB] Safari's in a Westy

The sliders closest to each front vent window are in the way of the front
cot pole. With the windows closed, I just unscrewed the &quot;butterfly&quot; bolt
from each slider and lifted the slider up to rest on the top of the front
curtain which I had closed up. Installed the cot and worked just fine....

'67 Westy


&gt; Planning on installing a set of safari's in my 67 westy. Was wondering if
&gt; the child's cot can still be used if the safari's are closed? Will the
&gt; safari's mounting brackets and sliders be in the way of the cots front
&gt; pole?Any input would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance...
