Subject: Double Cab Project

At the end of the last episode, my new double cab had been bonked
pretty good by the tow truck on the way home.  After discussions 
with the tow company, I decided to let them fix it.  They picked
the car up on Tuesday, worked on thru Friday, and were going to
bring it home Friday, but the mix of weather and workload didn't
let it happen.  They dropped it off this AM.  They also sent me
digipix before they laid any filler, and to get my approval before
the delivery. The fix is OK, but the whole corner needs to be 
bent out another 1/8&quot; on the left side.  I shoulda send the apron
and engine lid with it.  Oh, and I should have removed the emblem -
it wasn't bolted on, and it bounced off somewhere along the way.

Here's a link to pix: http://vintagebus_dot_com/cgi-bin/gallery-search.cgi?string=cat%3D61dc

It needs work, but overall it's not a huge project.  The biggest
challenge will be to undo the &quot;fall-through&quot; modification, and I already
go the pieces I need for that from Greg.

The radio hole was hacked, but I have a replacement piece.  There's
some rust holes in the cargo floor, and the front floors are rusty.
Easy fixes.  It's been lowered by pulling springs in the front.  I'm
going to clean up one of my spare beams, replace the pivot bushing
while it's out on the ground, and swap.   I also have new tie rods,
a rebuilt steering box, and some other goodies just laying around.

The bed is in nice shape.  The gates have some rust, but not too bad.
They're pretty straight.  Still waiting to take delivery of the rear
gate.

Anyone have the proper wheel arch sections laying around they wanna sell??

I also need some spring plates.  I have a bus I could get some from,
but it would make it impossible to move it around, which would suck...

I'd also like to find a bay-window tank.

I do have some double-cab questions though:

* I don't think this rear seat is correct: 
http://www.vintagebus_dot_com/gallery/image/2001871.JPG - it's reminiscient of
the flat seat that was in my '55 westy.  The bus came with another seat, 
which is more like the one in my 60

* what is this tube?
