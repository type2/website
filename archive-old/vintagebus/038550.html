&gt; Conversation starter?? Are you serious, like your bus isn't interesting
&gt; enough and you don't have anyone else to talk to anyways?

I was refering to us splittie folk.  You know us that have seen most
everything and a cool plate, especially a YOM, sticks out as being different
and leads you to meeting other cool folks like us that are not on the list
and one thing leads to another and you talk about each others splits and
then you go for a ride and then there's that first kiss and
..............well I'd better stop there, it's just a license plate anyhow
and who would get hot over that.  I guess if you really wanted a
conversation starter you could have the plate .. TLK2ME.

If it's worth doing, it's worth doing
yourself.
