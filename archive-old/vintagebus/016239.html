I have a picture of one of those in my gallery section, under accessories.
They're commonly known as &quot;ambulance steps&quot; although we've seen them on
other models.  A friend of mine has a '59 standard that has one, and I've
seen them on deluxes as well.  I have heard of westfalias having them,  but
can't recall seeing one.  It's a bolt-on item, so theoretically any bus
could have one.

THere are two types; one for buses with belly pans, one for normal buses.  
There's also versions out there with the pedal on the other side, for buses 
with the cargo doors on the left, and, ostensibly, for westfalias with
iceboxes, to facilitate operation.

&gt; Hello list,
&gt; I am looking for information on a slide out spring loaded step that I have 
&gt; removed from a 63 deluxe.  Could a 67 Westy have come with such a step? Does 
&gt; anyone have info or pictures of this step they could share? The step is very 
&gt; rusty but can be repaired, I am just unsure how it should look and operate.  
&gt; As always thanks for any help.

Thom
