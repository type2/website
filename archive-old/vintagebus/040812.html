It's a bench seat, two part, but the connection between the front
and back is the only one.  There is no distinction between the back
and the bottom, thus I can't look behind the seat.

Jeff,

If it is the original seat, it should be in two sections.  1/3 (driver)
2/3(passanger).  Its a bench seat...right?  The passenger seat will tilt as
a
unit forward hinged at the base of the front part of the seat.  Grab the top
of the seat (2/3rds section) and tilt it forward. Look closely and you'll
see
how it works.  The spare is directly behind the seat.

&gt; On second look, I think it's a standard.  It just doesn't
&gt; have the pop-outs for the 2 door or opposite windows, but
&gt; it does have middle and rear seats, unlike a combi.
&gt;
&gt; I can't find a way to get behind the front seat, as the base
&gt; of the back just won't come up.  Oh yeah, I don't have a VIN
&gt; on paperwork, as there wasn't any paperwork.
&gt;
&gt; Now that I take a closer look at some details, the windshield
&gt; wipers are locked in one position, straight up!  Nothing
&gt; short of breaking them will make them move however, oh well.
&gt;
&gt; It does have totally clear front turn signal lenses tho.
&gt; Odd very wide front license plate holder, standard shape on rear.

&gt; presented as a Combi
&gt;&gt;
&gt; &lt;&lt; I just got fixing my new bus!
&gt;  It was presented as a '66 Combi, with a two
&gt;  tone paint job, white over red.  The interior panels
&gt;  are the cheapo ones, no pop-outs, so it's a kombi.
&gt;  No uprights or overriders for the bumpers either.
&gt;  The right mirror arm is broken off, but the original
&gt;  driver side one is round.  It has all of the seats!
&gt;
&gt; Strange muffler that starts correctly out the side,
&gt; but then goes straight back.  Oh well.
&gt; One wiper arm is a little bent too.
&gt; All of this for just seven and half!
&gt;
&gt; I had to do some dis-assembly &amp; re-assembly to get
&gt; the front seat re-installed properly, but it went
&gt; pretty easy.
