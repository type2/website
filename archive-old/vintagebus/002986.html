Nah, I got one out once. Take the plasma cutter and drop the floor off.
Stand it up against the fence so you can get at it. Take a cold chisel and
the BFH and cut the two ears that the pin goes through right off of there,
then take the whole assembly to the bench vice. The pin taps right out.

&gt; I think its one of those urban VW legends that some one, somewhere,
removed
&gt; that pin from the lever arm.  I don't believe its ever been done ;-)  I
know
&gt; I wasn't successful.
