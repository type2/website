Subject: Re:  [VB] difference between 1500 and 1600
To: Vwbus58_at_aol_dot_com, vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

You have an H case?  it may not be a 1500, it may have already been changed 
to a 1600.  The ps&amp;cs fit just the same.   The 1600 cylinders have a slightly 
larger ID and slightly thinner walls than the 1500.  But the OD is the same 
where it fits the case and the heads. Sort of like a 1641 set will fit too, 
which has a slightly larger ID and slightly thinner cylinder walls than the 
1600.    The heads fit the same.      You can buy a new case if you feel like 
spending the money, but an H case will work fine as a 1600.  The older alloys 
are more susceptable to damage from over heating, but I had an H case in my 
first split and it drove great for years.   dunno if it was a 1600 or a 1500.

I am in the middle of rebuilding my engine and suddenly realize that it is 
one of the last 1500 cc and not a 1600 cc like I thought that I had  .

will 1600 single port heads also be 1500 cc heads ?
does the engine kit that i bought for a 1600 cc single port fit corrrectly?

what are the differences
shall I just buy a new case for a 1600 with dual reliefs and install my 
single port heads?
