Subject: RE: [VB] power converters

Buy a honda power inverter, put it on the roof rack and use it to power the
heater. High wattage inverters run down batteries real fast. 2500 watt
inverter will run down 6 RV batteries in about 6 hours under full load.
That's what they told me next door where they sell those units.

Subject: [VB] power converters


hi all. you know those 12v to 110 power converters?
well, here's my idea. i have a space heater at home
that needs 1500 watts to run and it heats my 20 x 14
room in about 20 minutes. my current power converter
cannot not power this beast. so iwas thinking of
getting a power converter that could put out 1500
watts. now my question is, will that put too much
strain on the battery/generator? would i have to go
for an alternator at that point? and if so, what is
the cutoff point for what a generator can handle
safely? thanks for all your help.

in Minnesota, heat is a valuable as water on Arakkis
(sorry, i just watched Dune ast night).
