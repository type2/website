Produced by a very cool and generous retired Engineer named Jim Harvey of
Scottsdale AZ.
Contact Jim at (602)585-4745. 9am-5pm only please. Although &lt;guessing that
he is&gt; in his mid to later 70's, he has to be one of the most ingenious guys
that I've ever met.

The purpose of this metal &quot;hatch stick&quot; item is to extend/prop open the rear
hatch of all generations of buses (in parked mode) yet keep it secured. The
prop distance is approximately 8&quot;-12&quot;. The prop stick is neat for keeping
the rear hatch cracked for ventilation. Each end of the stick latches right
into the OEM latch mechanisms. Sticks are produced for Vanagons and older.
Ask about Eurovans if interested.

Jim and his wife Pat, are members of the NEATO affiliated SWATO bus club
based within the Eastern Phoenix Metro area. Everything that Jim does is top
notch quality. Tell Jim or Pat that you heard about this from Jim Ellis and
the Arizona Bus Club via the internet.
