&gt; I'm new to vw's and building a 1776 for 67std. I know that sp will run
&gt; cooler than a dp, but really do not know pro's &amp;con's of each. Any help
&gt; will be greatly appreciated.

Hi John,
SP will deliever more torque, while DP will result in more HP at much higher 
RPMs.  For a bus the SP and its resulting increased torque over DP is 
absolutely needed.  At least this seems to be the rule of thumb for engines 
up to at least 1776cc size.  For even more torque go with more stroke of the 
crankshaft and less bore.
