Subject: Re: [VB] odd tin/ firewall grommets

&gt;
&gt;What's up with the front tin with the buildt in porch/ thingy for the
doghouse
exit.  I've got one like that and though it odd, usually the doghouse front
tin has just an opening there, no covered exit.
&gt;
That's the tin from a '66 Type 3.

Yes, the rubber wears out.  In this particular VW, that is the 2nd bushing
in the car since 1966 so they last a while.  The original bushing is still
supple, just torn in half.  Check it when you check/replace your fuel lines.
