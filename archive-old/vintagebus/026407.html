Aloha,
   I've recently been trying to fix up a 67 kombi that I just became the
proud owner of.  However, I am a little new to VWs(and this list), and
was wondering if someone could help me out with a tran/engine
question..........Am I asking for trouble by leaving my transmission
with the reduction gears?  Are the gears able to be removed and still
use the existing swing axle transmission or does/can the newer kind IRS
have to be put in its place?  I plan on putting in a 1641 or 1776 engine
as I am constantly driving across the island to surf and enjoy hitting
60+ in order to maximize my before work surf time (uphill Kam hwy when
you're late for work is a bitch).  Any replies and experience would be
greatly appreciated.  
  Oh yeah, what exactly makes a Frwy Flyer Fly?  It sounds just like
what I need.   
  Thanks,    JD
