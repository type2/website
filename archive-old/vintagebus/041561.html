&gt; Something I've always wondered: those of you who do these road-trips-from-hell -
&gt; how do you afford that?  I can't imagine taking 6 months off to
&gt; go fart around the countryside.  Not having any recently deceased rich 
&gt; relatives, if I don't work, I don't eat, and my buses don't eat.

Well, Thom, what I did was get a BS in engineering.  Then I went back to
school, did some graduate work, got a teaching credential, switched jobs,
took a 35% pay cut, and acquired 2 unpaid months of &quot;summer vacation&quot;

All in all, a good trade.  money one can get, but each of us has only a
limited amount of time.

As Malcolm Forbes said:  Money isn't everything, as long as you have
enough.
