I'd like to gather suggestions from the list on things (tools, parts etc.) to 
have along on a highway trip.  Items you were glad that you had, or wish that 
you did, when that inevitable breakdown happened. I'm sure that the collective 
experience of the list can produce suggestions that will help some less 
seasoned road warriors to happier trails this summer.
