Subject: was/ New welder-A done deal/now our heeps!

  I really don't think that &quot;it's nobody want's to work on them anymore&quot;,
it's just as the cost of living goes up, wages, insurance, gas, overhead
increase, nobody wants to pay the mechanic an honest wage (to work on the
air cooled). I get the &quot;I only paid 500 for my bus, what do you mean an
engine is going to cost 2 to 3 thousand dollars&quot; or 700 to a 1000 for a
COMPLETE brake overhaul, notice I said OVERHAUL.
  It has come to that point to where the average Joe cannot afford or
doesn't want to pay a mechanic what it cost (parts and labor) to fix. That's
why you need to do it yourself.
  I have a lot of friends in the VW repair business and they quit working on
AIR COOLED all together. It's easier and quicker (and you make more money)
tuning up a Jetta then an air cooled VW. As we all know tuning a air cooled
VW is a precise endevor and time consuming (to do it right) and needs to
charged accordingly. Customers of mine can't figure out why it cost twice as
much money to tune their VW then their Toyota pick-up!


ronnie   we are a dieing breed.
