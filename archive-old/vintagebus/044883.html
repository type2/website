&lt;&lt; A friend of mine wants to know if early Bus 15 inch wheels will fit his 68 
Bus.  We know that the bolt pattern is the same,but does the different offset 
cause any tire rubbing problems with 165SR15 size tires?  &gt;&gt;
Hi Skid,
Doubt it!  Plus you probably would be able to go up to 235/75R15s as we can 
do on the rear axle of our 1963 SC.   Eric&amp;Barb
