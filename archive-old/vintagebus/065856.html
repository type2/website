&gt; What to replace?  Anything worn.  plate on floor under shift stick? new
shift 
&gt; bushings in front, and middle?  to get to the rear bushing you have to
pull 
&gt; the tranny.  I'd remove the cables, clean out the tubes, install fresh
cables 
&gt; with grease, and install the rubber dust covers at the ends of the cable 
&gt; tubes.

Well I definately need new parking brake cables - whoever resprayed the
interior painted the hand brake with two pack without removing the cables.
I rethread the cables and managed to get the nuts off but I don't fancy
putting them back.  These did not seem to have tubes - well at least they
didn't to where they go through the front cross member.

I think I am going to have to take a look at a friends bus which is
relatively original having sat in a barn for 14 years to see the way each of
the cables should go from front to rear.

Thanks
Paul
