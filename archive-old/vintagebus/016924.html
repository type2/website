Hey all,

For all of you at work today like myself....I'm sorry.  Well had a intensely 
productive weekend.  Put in new front wheel bearings, all new shoes, new 
flex lines, and 2 new wheel cylinders (sanded out the ones left.  Bus stopes 
really good, but is now pulling to either side from time to time.  Hopefully 
some final adjustments will cure that.  Saturday made a 280 mile round trip 
to pick up a nonwalktru cab divider panel THANKS JOHN!  Sunday ripped of my 
fiberglass 70s style wheel flares with much excitemnent (I hated those damn 
things!).  Ran out of time last night so my bus is kickin it frankenstein 
style with one propper wheel in with only half the beads grinded down and 
one just gapping open!  Should have both of them in and grinded and primed 
tonight.  Just thought I share some of the positive feedback my bus (sprout) 
has decided to shed.  Have a great and safe holiday!

Eric
