Hi,

Don't know for sure about the Sundial crank windows. Take a
close look at them. All the Hehr windows I have seen have
the name stamped into the metal around the rim. The
distributor told me that Hehr no longer makes the louvered
windows and has not for many years. Hehr is located in LA.
You could try to call them.

I will need to dig to find that number again. It has been
several months since I went down that thread. The
distributor is in Holister, CA however.

Chris


&gt; Does Hehr also make the Sundial style crank out windows
that fit into the
&gt; stock window openings?  If so, gimme the number of the
distributor!!  : )
