Subject: Very Cool Find
References: &lt;199807191758.KAA30545_at_yiff.azaccess_dot_com&gt;

One of my customers told me about a bus that he had found about an hour
and a half from where I live. He said it would only be good for parts as
it was totally rusty, but it was only $20 for everything. He had found
it at a garage sale way out in the country. My customer didn't write
down the address and didn't get a phone number of the guy who owned the
bus. He knew the name of the country road and thought he remembered the
address though.

Well, today was another 100 plus degree day in the my part of the SF bay
area and the area where this bus is (which is near the coast), was going
to be a lot cooler, so, what the hell. I decided I would try and locate
this $20 jewel. After all, I am a VW nut and the prospect of a new find
always gets me excited.

I set off with some really limited info on where the bus was. I finally
found the country road, but the address numbers didn't go up as high as
I was told and every house had a gravel road like the one I was looking
for as well. It looked pretty hopeless.

I saw a guy working on his Harley at a farm I passed and stopped to ask
him about the clues that I had to locate the bus. It turned out that it
was right next door. The helpful Harley guy said that at one time he was
totally into VW sand rails and hot rod motors and eventually told me
that when I was done stripping the bus, to come back and he would take
me to look at an early bus that he had that he might sell to me. What a
coincidence. He had bought the bus for the engine it had in it and had
stored it at a friends farm for about 6 years.

I went next door and the parts bus was really in terrible shape. About
the only good part was the nose and I couldn't string electricity out
the 1/4 mile to hook up the Sawzall. The bus was a '66 Deluxe. No front
end. No trans. Filled with pine needles. Totally rusted out. The front
seat frames were there but even they were not usable. Same with the pop
out windows. Same with everything else that was on it. The owner had
sold parts off of it many times. I left with only a rear cargo door. It
was free. It was a beautiful day though.

I went back to the Harley guys place and he showed me some very cool
engine stuff. 15-20 years ago, he had lived near Gene Berg and Gene
helped him accumulate these parts to put together a 19??cc engine. The
crank was a 1600 Okrassa unit. I have never seen these before. Also he
had a set of aluminum cylinder Ps &amp; Cs that were 90. or 90.5s.  He said
that at the time he bought these that the crank was $1,500 and the Ps &amp;
Cs were $1,200. Has anyone ever heard of this stuff. He seemed to have
all the rest of the parts to put it together including a set of brand
new Weber 48s. The Okrassa crank was very interesting.

Well getting back to the cool find, we headed out further into the
country to another farm. Down a really wicked mountain road to the
middle of nowhere. We stopped and got out. I still couldn't see any
buses. Just tall weeds. We walked into a thicket and in the middle, it
cleared out a bit. Lo and behold, amongst the PU trucks and 18 wheel
cabs was a lonely bus. It had an early ribbed bumper on the front but it
wasn't a barndoor. It also had cargo doors on the driver side. Looking
very cool. I was getting pretty excited. Got closer and noticed that it
had some weird body modifications.

It turns out to be a lunch wagon bus. The passenger side long wall
didn't have normal doors, but one door that lifted up to show an all
stainless steel roach coach counter. The rear hatch was a no window
hatch that lifted up to reveal some coffee spigots and some warming
cupboards. On the driver rear side was another no window rear hatch that
lifted up to reveal more coffee spigots. The double doors opened up to
an area where the carbonation bottles and propane tanks are stored.
Every door opened up to show all stainless steel construction
everywhere, even on the doors themselves. The bus was rusty but the
stainless was perfect and complete. I was so excited I almost peed my
pants. I have never seen a bus like this in my life. I have seen
pictures of some really simple candy and ice cream buses, but never
anything like this. It even had ambulance fans.

Needless to say, I am going back to pick it up next weekend. Does
anybody have any pictures or info on these coversions?
Sorry to be so long winded, but it was exciting to discover something so
unusual.
