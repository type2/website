I've had bad luck with resleeving brake cylinders in New Zealand.  They
leaked.  The only reason people in Austral-Asia resleeve is because new
parts are so overpriced if even available.  You don't want to even know
how expensive any car part is in New Zealand!  Though, Robert King is
right, some day we will have to resleeve when new parts are no longer
available!   Gary Gibson   Tucson
