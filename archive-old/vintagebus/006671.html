You think it's expensive here, I just got off the phone to a friend of mine
in England, the cheapest swap spot there is 350.00 U.S. that's just to swap,
a vendors spot cost 1200.00 so I guess we really don't have it that bad at
some of the shows here.

Ya know, Thom, sometimes the truth hurts...

So in his spare time he plays with American Iron, but for his full time gig,
he does VW customizing?  Isn't it ironic?  So VWs are the bread and butter
of what he does, but he can't make a living doing the hot rod customizing?
I don't really see why he would have gotten upset in the first place.  Funny
how little things get people's underpants all twisted around!

I wouldn't attend the classic even if I could!

Paul
