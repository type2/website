&gt; George asks,

&gt; &gt; I installed the new belt (is it me, or are the Continental belts getting
&gt; &gt; tighter?).
&gt; 
&gt; Was that  a new OE 9.5 x 905  Conti-belt, and are their very few if any
&gt; shims left for future adjustment?  Yes. You may want to put the 11,3X912
&gt; Conti belt on for a better fit and adjustment.

Hmmm, that's my experience.  I added an extra shim to get the proper
tension.  I think that they're labeling 10mm belts as 9.5.
