Subject: re:[VB] UHaul Horror Story?- F Uhaul!

Mr. Heron asked:
Has anyone else had dealings with UHaul concerning this and how were they
(hopefully) resolved? I want to sort this nonsense out before I get to the
UHaul store to find out that they may not have what I reserved.

YES! During 2001, I had an oppty to rent a two whl dolly for local hauling of a
low dough bay unit within metro Phoenix AZ area for minimal hours and minimal
miles. Called several local UHaul outlets with no success. Popularity of folks
leaving California for Arizona/Oregon/WA like lemmings going off a cliff caused
a local shortage. Big hassle. Finally found success and made the reservation
for Sunday AM. Clock ticked 5PM on that Saturday afternoon... All locations
closed for the day... 
Phone rang about 5:30-6PM. It was the Uhaul Corporate reservation center
calling and TELLING me that my reservation was yanked to accomodate a long
distance customer. I was told that my Credit card would be credited with/not
charged with  the amount quoted on my &quot;reservation.&quot;
The good Lord  and this list knows that I could go on for paragraphs but...
Bottom line is that I was charged the full amount for the tow dolly, it took
several months to get the charge reversed, was charged interest by VISA for
something that I didnt use and was left in a lurch by a money grubbing
corporation who hires smart assed unprofessional reservation agents.

I happily towed the fatchick via &quot;Scooter Pete's&quot; two whl dolly that was
missing all evidence of lights, tsignals and license plates for the cost of a
6pack of premium beer. I gave Pete a 12 pack and a hardback of red and white
filters which made him happy and more willing to lend me his dolly of future
South Phoenix black ops. Pete and I quickly turned the 12 into a 10 pack! 
All is well and F U-haul. (not to be confused with F y'all) ;-)
