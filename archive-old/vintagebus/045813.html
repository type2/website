I used a bunch of milk thistle seed extract tinture when painting my 65, and 
it really helped me not mind the toxic fumes.  It is a liver tonic, and 
actually I am less sensitive to them than I was before.    Make you own  or 
buy it in tincture form.

 Our plans for the bus color are now L87 Pearl White on top and L360 Sea Blue
 on the bottom (even though it's a bug color, it'll still be cool).  As far
 as the color matching goes, I hope, since I will be using cheaper paint,
 that I can get the magickal Sea Blue that I had on my '66 bug.  That was the
 greatest color....it shifted in different light, and always had a really
 indefinable quality about it.  If anyone has any suggestions on how to get
 matches from photos, please let me know!
------------------
sea blue L360  was also used on buses
in 1965, it was used with bluewhite L289 on standard and deluxe micros
for the 66/67 models years it was paired with L680 cumuluswhite

someone had a link for recipes from PPG from the L code- I thought I had 
saved it but I can't find it.
 ................................
 Also:  Does anyone have a good technique for removing glass without breaking
 it?  I cut out all the old seals, except for the rear hatch.  The seal is
 actually in great shape, and it would be a shame to waste $20....unless I
 broke the glass trying to get it out!
  &gt;&gt;

you can used wooden popsicle sticks to pry back the rubber. From the inside, 
and then push the glass out  to be caught by the person standing on the 
outside.  A bunch of popsicle sticks.  Metal screwdrivers will chip the 
glass.  with sekurit glass (which you back hatch should be) the glass can 
flex a whole bunch, but laminated/sigla/delog glass it will crack before it 
flexes.  I removed the back window this way when painting my westy, as I had 
just installed an NOS seal with nice molded corners a couple years before and 
wanted to reuse it.   It's kinda neat to see how the glass flexes.  I was 
really surprised.
