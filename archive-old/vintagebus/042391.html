hi all,

a couple of years ago on the lists, everyone was recommending that if you
have a busted windshield on your split, just go get one cut to fit and
drive away....

Nowadays, everyone seems to be spending a lot of time looking for thses
items... and even when you find em they are usually
chipped/scratched/white from the edges etc.

Why does no-one just get a piece cut anymore?  Its cheap. its easy. its
quick.

I guess maybe its the whole vintage thing, everyone wants a logo i
suppose...

peas,

Steve
