Thom,

Thats generally why i havent felt any special need to add seatbelts to my
61, once you hips are held down, getting rear ended with great force
will snap your spine instead of ejecting you with gret force headfirst
onto whatever is in your cargo area...

Since i have a nice soft westy bed back there, i've elected to take my
chances....

take care,

Steve

p.s. the best way to make a split safe is to a) remove the engine and
b) buy a volvo. If you were sufficiently motivated i'm sure you could put
in a nice roll cage with forward impact protection, 5 point belts, and
seats with adequate head support, but it certainly wouldnt look original
afterwards, hehe

p.p.s. really the driver is 90% of safety.  Avoiding collisions is better
than surviving them almost every time.
