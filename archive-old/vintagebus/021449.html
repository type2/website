 Thats good! ?
 Compression was 105 110 105 110
 Sounds good.
 All plugs but #1 looked &quot;black&quot; .

 Any input?

 &gt; Just as I pulled into Everybus, I noted that there was a little more smok=
e
 &gt; that normal, but have a leaky oil cooler, so was not concerned. Spent the
 &gt; weekend socializing and losing the chili cookoff, and losing the best
 &gt; campsite prize. :-)
 &gt;
 &gt; Topped off the oil, lost about =BC quart on the trip down. Sunday as I
 pulled
 &gt; out all started ok, no worries.
 &gt;
 &gt; Got gas at about 10 miles and had a little start problem. Humm???
 &gt;
 &gt; 30 more miles and started noticing a loss of power. Looked at the trees.
 Not
 &gt; that much head wind. Then &quot;the smell&quot; hit me. Hot and pulled over. Ouch,
 &gt; VERY VERY HOT. Dumping a fair amount of oil.
...
 &gt; My question: What did I do to this engine? Got really hot. Jamie shot his
 &gt; thermometer at it and was 240 on the case and 350 on the heads, but that
 was
 &gt; after cooling down and 10 miles of flatland going 40 to 45mph. My plan is
 to
 &gt; check the valve clearances, then compression, then jank it to put Urge's
 (71
 &gt; bus) engine in. What would you do?
 &gt;
 &gt; After cooling down, I estimate the engine was running on about 75% of
 normal
 &gt; power. Hills I take at 38 in third were struggling at 30 or going to
 second
 &gt; gear.
