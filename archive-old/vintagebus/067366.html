Subject: Re: [VB] re:heaters

Keep your eyes peeled for a gas heater, there are plenty out there, swap
meets, the samba and ebay are good places to look.  Just pick one up, then
start gathering tune up parts and a manual.  Before long, you'll have a
blast furnace for your bus that will melt your propane heater!!

Don't get me wrong, the propane heaters are nice, but with the moisture in
the air and the fear of tipping or knocking it over, a gas heater is much
more long term and safer.  And with the gas heater, you don't have to fuss
with those little expensive propane bottles that seem to run out all the
time.

&gt; Thanks to everyone for all the responses, the stewart warner or southwind
&gt; heaters sound great, but for now i think i will go with a procat heater. I
&gt; can always find another use for it if I install one of the other heaters,
&gt; but I don't think I am up for installing one of those heaters this winter-no
&gt; time, and space is difficult to get this time of year. I usually work on
&gt; mine in my driveway, but not at these temps.
