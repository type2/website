Subject: Re: [VB] shipping a bus

&gt; does anyone on here know a good place to go thru to have a bus shipped
&gt; from  oregon to the east coast?

&gt;Try Dependable auto shippers.  They are on the net.  I had a bus
&gt; shipped from  california to new england.  Cost approximately $850 to
&gt; $1200.


I agree DAS is good to deal with. Shipped a porsche from Sacto to Detroit
in acovered trailer paid just over $1000. Try Joel 800 826 1083 x668 out
of LA very nice guy. Not the cheap est but I would use them again.
