Subject: Re: [VB] RE: Tires Question




&gt; Where is the best place to buy Kleber145r15 tires in California? I know
&gt; Coker tire is in TN and their the ones that make and sells them. My bus is
&gt; with out two tires and the weather is nice right now so I like to be out on
&gt; the road.

Oops.....they are spelled Kleber.
They are made by Michelin, not Coker......Coker only sells them.
I just searched 20 pages on Google for Michelin tires or Kleber tires but came
up with zilch in 145 r15 size...
