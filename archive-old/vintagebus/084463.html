Subject: Re: [VB] Speaking of Oil...

when I blew out an oil filter on my 65 the pressure was off the  scale.  
However, normally in winter the initial pressure is off the scale,  so I don't 
know how much higher than 'safe' it had to be to blow it... and yes  that filter 
had the internal relief thingy!!!!  And it was below freezing,  one of the 
colder mornings, maybe 25F, 20F  not just 30F
 
I used to run 30 wt in winter, 20/50 in summer as the 20/50 is thicker (as  
Everett said, that's better for worn engines with flickering oil lights at  
idle)
I once drained the oil after the oil temp got over 230 (laden summer desert  
driving) and the consistency was weird... thin and gloppy... So I stopped 
doing  20/50 after that.   Though some people feel 230-240 is  okay, and say  the 
glop never happened to their oil,  well..  it was a shock to me.   Now I just 
run 30wt all the time, except the  engine in the 65 (phat oil pump).

We  do not remember the pressure, but it was more than the 30 WT we   used.  
So 
thusly our comment that it acted more like 40 WT when  cold.   We also had no 
problems with our oil/filter pump and 30  Wt. oil in  colder wether.  Till we 
blew out two oil filters  without internal relief  valves!  That is another 
thing one  learns just to avoid if possible.
