I was wrong about that code - I get that 374 and my 388 mixed up.  I
remember when I was having trouble finding out what 388 was someone else was
having trouble finding out what 374 was.  The person who figured out 374
also told me that 388 was for the pop-out latches, you would think that I
could remember my one option code - oh well, at least I was right about that
bad boy's birthday.
