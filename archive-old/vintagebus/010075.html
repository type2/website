I went out to Walmart tonight and on the top shelf in front on the bottom
(slightly hidden from view) was another Walmart show stoppers bus and bug
set.  The first person that wants it just needs to email me.  It cost me
$13.80 and then shipping will be 2.5 pounds from the 68310 area code.

First come first serve.
