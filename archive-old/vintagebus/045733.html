there a mid sized one for that style shifter or is it the same as the later 
models? &gt;&gt;
Hi Doug,
We can only find one shifter holder in the parts books for bus.
211 711 105  Ball housing - Gearshift lever.
This compared to four front gearshift rods, and three gearshift levers used 
up to 1968 model year.
