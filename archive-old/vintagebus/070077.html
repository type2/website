Subject: Re: [VB] Seat Belt Installation

Which type of inertia reel belts did you use?
I have a set off a 75 Microbus that I'll probably fit
in my 67 Panel.
Was it difficult to get the angle correct?
:o)
Cheers &amp; God Bless

&gt; I bought an inertia reel seat belt and mounted both
&gt; the reel and the end of 
&gt; the belt on seat platform (wheel well). The seat
&gt; belt end went into the 
&gt; original lap belt mount, and I made a large backing
&gt; plate for the reel mount.

&gt; Lots of work, works well.
