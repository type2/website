Subject: Funny Story--But Almost Caught My Lunch--

I rarely report on any any PM type items I have performed on any of my
vehcles--but this one takes the cake- and is a warning to any of you
screwing around with gas lines under your vehicles.

Thursday,I decide to do the winter PM on my 85 GL--it's the winter
horse, and I want it to run , when I want it to run--so it's tune up
time, and gas filter and clean the K&amp;N air filter time.

First the under belly work--

I clamp off the outbound fuel line from the tank--and udo the clamps on
the filter, and yank it off--some of the residual gas in the other side
of the line dripped out (I guess) and the trouble light, which was
laying behind me on the floor must have caught a bit of the gas---BANG
!!!!

The light bulb blew out--the gas caught on fire--and in a ball of flame
I BLEW out from under the Van on my creeper with my left sleeve of my
work shirt ablaze---running to get a fire extuinguisher--with the bottom
side of the Van --SMOKIN', as well as the floor below. 
3 ft. flames were bellowing out from under the Van--I think--oh shit--I
just loaded the tank up full of gas on the way to work--

I got the fire out pretty quick--and other than the plastic fuel filter
housing being a bit deformed, everything else was just ducky--no fire
damage--

My buddy who was servicing a Mack on the other side of the shop,
casually mentioned he has never seen me move so fast since he met me 29
yeras ago--and laughed--sick puppy---:&gt;)

Anyway, the moral of the story here sport fans--( and I've had no
problems with gas and a drop cord ever ) move the light waaay behind you
and outa the way prior to screwing around with any gas line--or filter--

This caper changed the color of my jockeys for sure--:&gt;)

Take Care--
