Subject: [VB] RE: 21K bus

Is this bus/trailer combo originally from Florida? Was this combo in a
magazine?
Was this combo ever previously presented at the Barrett aka slash
Barrett-Jackson auction? If so I have some opinions. In my old age I have
somewhat mellowed. Also I have no idea if it is, in fact, the combo that I
remember.

God bless them for getting that kind of dollar~ especially in this market.
AND especially if it is the combo that I remember. HA-hahahahaha...

The BJ Auction has had some really nice buses run through it. But I have seen
some real honkers. One was a 23 from Texas that looked like a Sonoran hack
together and the fools who ran it through turned DOWN $24.5 (1999) I bet they
wish now that they had taken it at that time.

I will not climb on the annual post Winter auction season bashing. Knowing your
market, recognizing quality and enjoying life when it's all done are factors to
consider. Pffft! I will crawl back to my $200. Dasher and be happy. hahaha
