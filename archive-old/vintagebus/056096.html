Found that the
&gt; 1971, 72, &amp; 73 &quot;Without Guesswork&quot; manual that we got last year states
that
&gt; the bore diameter for the tandem master cylinder used from Chassi No. 211
2
&gt; 000 001 (1971) has a bore diameter of 23.81mm.  Checking our 1963-67 VW
bus
&gt; shop manual, it list 22.2mm diameter bore for the 1955-67 MCs

According to the RMMW catalog, admittedly not as accurate as Bently etc.,
the 50-67(66?) bus MC has a 22.2mm bore.  Both the 211 611 021Q for '68-'69
bus and the 211 611 021J for a '70 bus also have a 22.2mm bore and are
non-servo units.  Has anyone tried either of these?  The local shop doesn't
carry these in stock so I could not physically compare to see if the
mounting is the same.  If someone could look at them and let me know which
looks to be the best match I would be willing to try it out and report.

Would be nice
&gt; if someone who has more education in brakes could figure out how much leg
&gt; pressure or at least % differance it is.

Probably 7%.  The other thing is you are pushing more fluid per &quot;x&quot; of pedal
travel.  Your leg can push different amounts based on the angle of the bend
of the knee.  So there is another variable for you.  Of course that will
vary for each different driver.  In real life I doubt either the change in
pedal travel or the minimal bore size difference are anything to worry
about...unless you rear end someone and their lawyer finds out you messed
with the brake system.  8-)  Thom?
