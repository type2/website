Subject: Solex 30 PICT 1 electric choke/stepped cam (long)

Hi All,
We're back on the list after a 5 year absence and it's good to see some
of the same old faces-or is it names?

The reason we're back is our newly-rescued '61Standard. Found her
sitting in a parking garage building in downtown Santiago, where she'd
been since 1973. You can't even begin to imagine the layers of soot :-p
everywhere, inside and out. A couple of thorough washings and a can of
rubbing compound later, the beautiful original mango green and seagull
grey paint shone through. I wish i could say the same about the mohair.
Haven't dared touch that yet in case it dematerializes like a vampire
exposed to sunlight.

A nephew of the previous (and only) elderly owner decided to sell her
because he was paying too much, year after year, for the parking space.
He also owns 70, yes, that is seventy, 2CV Citrokns. He figured he
could squeeze 2 in the space taken by the bus.

A hair raising drive (bad brakes, soaked linings) to the mechanic who
had tended to the bus innards since new (he started out sweeping floors
at the VW dealer and IMHO should have stayed at that) for a detailed
history, new brake seals and linings, flush and change all liquids,
lube all fittings, replacement of fuel lines and wheel bearing repack.

We got done late, and in the middle of our first fall storm, headed out
through atrocious nightime rush-hour traffic (chileans drive like
romans, but most are not as skilled) and flooded streets to the
highway. Thanking the teutonic gods for our ground clearance, we waded
past fleets of forlorn peugeots, hyundais and hondas adrift in the
avenues which had turned into rivers. Other than the occasional
broadside soak from the huge yellow and white urban busses which
insisted in maintaining their standard practice of racing each other
three and four abreast to the next bus stop, competing for passengers,
we remained, in the main, dry. The safari's original rubber held well,
but the side window seals were not as effective after 42 years of
service.

An hour later we reached the highway and faced a 40-50 kph headwind for
the hundred kilometre drive home. The PO had changed the engine to a
new 1500 in '67, so we were able to maintain about 55kph into this
headwind. It helped to tuck behind trucks when available. Great
headlights!

A stop at one of the chilean petrol company's huge gas
station-restaurant-shower-laundry, convenience store, etc. stops to
fuel up and tighten (by hand) the little brass nut on the windshield
wiper which had worked loose and reduced us to a mere inch and a half
of wiper travel and we were on our way.

An obstacle on the way home was a 7500 foot pass up and down a windy,
windy (ventilated and twisty) narrow road which they only got around to
paving last year.
The bus took it all in stride, mostly in third, and the really steep
sections in second.
It got quite cold near the top of the pass and no amount of twisting on
the heater knob would yield anything but ice-cold air. Luckily, the
H78-15's were new, and we did fine on the sleet. The descent into our
home valley was fun, wiping the condensation on the windscreen with one
hand, steering the bus with the other, chasing a Eurovan past the
trucks which crawled down in low gear. Later, i was to learn a trick
the long haul bus drivers here use: smear some shampoo with a wet
sponge on the glass and let it sit. the bubbles clear up right away and
no more condensation.

Somewhere on the way down, trying to brake for a horse that was
skittering around on the road, blinded by a truck that had just passed,
the engine got stuck on open throttle. we hit the ignition switch,
trying to remember whether or not there was such a thing as a steering
lock on a split bus.

After coasting to a safe pull over spot (not many available on this
mountain) we ran around, church key in hand, pulled up the tailgate,
stuck our head in and promptly got a terrific whack on the back of our
neck and shoulders when a gust of wind blew the tailgate back down (so
that is what that funny angled piece sitting behind the battery is,
thought it was for a single cab treasure chest...) which helped a great
deal with our fumbling around in the dark (no engine compartment
lightmake note to install one of those really bright ones like the two
pair in the cabin) trying to trace the path of the accelerator cable
from the tin to the carb. This was our first contact with the subject
of this obnoxiously long missive. The stepped cam had lost it's rolled
pin and had swung down and back up to lodge under the idle screw.
Today we fabricated a pin out of a piece of brass wire terminal and
stuck it in there, restricting the cam's movement to the arc of the
slot in the cam.

Now here is the question: what is the method by which the electric
choke communicates with the stepped cam? the choke spiral has it's tab,
which engages the arm coming off of the choke (axle? what's the word
for that?) and pulls it shut when cold, then relaxes as it heats,
allowing it to open. The stepped cam fits on to a brass bearing which
pushes into the carb body, supporting said axle. A thin nut on the same
axle holds the cam on the bearing, but the cam rotates freely on the
bearing, so if the axle is actuated by the choke, the cam does not
respond to this movement. What is is supposed to do? The DPM
(aforementioned mechanic) had put a glob of 'sillycon' on the cam,
between the farthest two steps from the axle and adjusted the idle
screw in so that it idled way out there.

Here is another question: the tube which encloses the accel cable in
it's passage through the tin is loose, and moves back and forth
together with the cable. The grommet is split, so the rear (RIR) half
is still on the end of the tube as it moves. What should hold the tube
in place? The grommet?

Well there are more questions, but i think this list (or was it the
alfa list?) had a length limit so we'll leave it at that.

TIA,
Andres
