Hi Mark
I am told if you reach behind and unplug the wire on your sending unit and
turn your key to on and the gauge reads empty and then you ground out the wire
and it immediately goes to full the gauge is ok and the sending unit is shot.
If you here of a way to change the sending unit without removing the engine
please let me know as mine is toast.
