Subject: Re: Nickle-chromium filament wire

&gt; We need to find a source for .002 nickel-chromium wire.

That sounds really fine; it's smaller than 40 gauge.  On the other hand,
I haven't pulled a Bus sender apart before.

&gt; I believe the proper resistance value of the filament to be 87.5 Ohms.

http://www.nls_dot_net/mp/volks/htm/fuel_ga.htm implies, but doesn't come
out and say, that a Bus fuel sender is 100 ohms.  It also shows how the
sender works.  The last time I looked I think a Bus fuel tank is around
8&quot; to 10&quot; high, so there are two about 7&quot; to 9&quot; pieces of wire in there.
14&quot; total is 1.16 feet, and 18&quot; total is 1.5 feet.  If the 100 ohms
figure is correct, then you need wire with something between 85.7 and
66.7 ohms per foot.  According to
http://www.wiretron_dot_com/nicrdat.html , 40 gauge nichrome wire is around
67.6 to 70.2 ohms per foot, which is in the area of what you need.  So
maybe the 0.002&quot; isn't so weird (40 gauge is about 0.003&quot;).

There is also more than one kind of alloy for nichrome wire.  You
probably need to figure out what the sender resistance should be and
the total length of the wire, then look for an alloy that gives you an
ohms/foot value closest to that.

&gt; Does anyone know if the resistance of n-c wire is the same for 30 ga?

30 gauge NiCr won't be the same as 30 gauge Cu (copper), for sure.
Also, any wire will have a different ohms per unit length value as
the gauge changes - this will be especially pronounced in the smaller
gauges.  According to the chart above, 30 gauge NiCr A is about 6.5
ohms/foot.  Going up to 28 gauge gets 4.1 ohms/foot and down to 32 gauge
gets 10 ohms/foot.  Another way to put it is that if you wanted a Bus
sender to have 100 ohms total resistance, and you had 30 gauge NiCr A
wire, you'd need to get over 15 feet of it inside the sender somehow.

Wiretron doesn't have a price list and I've never dealt with them, but
they claim to sell small quantities.  Another place (that I also haven't
dealt with) is http://www.arcorelectronics_dot_com/ .
