That was Marantz,(the crazy).  Craig made a 4 track player that mounted
below the dash about the same time.  Each tape held a album, 8 to 10 tunes,
just like the 8 track tapes.  I have 60 or 70 4-track albums.  8-track tapes
had the pinch roller built in which caused tape speed problems whereas the
pinch roller in 4-track was part of the player and lock the tape into place.
Also the 8 track players ran at a slower speed cramming more magnetic
information closer together.  These two differences made 8-track less
expensive so more popular among buyers.  Kind of like the VHS vs. BetaMax.
Beta is better and is now the industry standard but VHS was cheaper.

If it's worth doing, it's worth doing
yourself.
