Subject: RE: [VB] First time non-greeting from ACVW

The wetwesties list serve just got off this thread... the census was most
*normal, conscience* bus drivers try to wave.  We all have mind lapses,
hopefully if you don't get a wave back, it was just a bad day for the
driver.  Maybe waving made the person feel a bit better after he was passed
and realized what had just happened!

Keep waving!
