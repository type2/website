Subject: RE: [VB] What is the toughest climb you ever drove?

From the California Classic in Irvine, in a westy loaded with another
partial westy interior inside,vw parts and my 250 lb bro over the Cajon
pass, and then all the way to Georgia in 3 1/2 days days by myself in 1995.
Also up to the top of Tahachapi in California over paved and dirt roads to
get some type 4 heads rebuilt at stephens machine shop (if youve ever been
there you know it's way up there), back at ya list.

Subject: [VB] What is the toughest climb you ever drove?


In my rant about my bus I was trying to remember the worst, most extreme
climbs I ever drove.

I came up with:

East out of Salt Lake City, heading to Cheyenne, Wyoming.

North out of Bishop California. I think I was heading for Lake Isabella.

Reno, Nevada to Grass Valley, California.

I-5 at the Cal- Oregon border (honorable mention, not too bad)
