I had a simular problem with the DD (1960, 12 volt) what it turnrd out being
was a bad connection of the hot lead at the light switch, the wire into the
spade connector (was converted from screw on) had worked loose so it wasn't
makeing good contact, caused many weird problems, I fixed this at the Red
Barn swap before Kelly Park, 1 thing everybody should have in there road kit
is a large yellow spade connector, nobody there had one in there road kits,
finally someone came in would had 1!, now I always have a few in my road
kit.
