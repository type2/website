Subject: Re: [VB] pop out window hinge
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

&gt; im going to install pop out windows in my 59' can anyone
&gt; give me any tips on welding the piano hinge to the body?

Yep, pop rivets. Usually when they are removed folks drill out the spot
welds. When you get everything measured up and are sure it is right, drill
out two of the holes and pop rivet the little rascals in. Go through all of
the trouble to install the window frame so you can check the fit and
alignment. If everything is good, go ahead and weld it in. If it needs
adjusted, drill out the pop rivet at that end, move the hinge and drill one
of the other holes and pop rivet it. Once you get it as you like it, weld.
You can drill out the pop rivets once you have it tacked in and then weld
those holes shut. Lots handier that trying to hold it in the right position
and weld it, you can actually check out the fit this way.
