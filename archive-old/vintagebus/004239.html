Before you sink $2800 into this bus, get under there and evaluate the
condition of the steering components.  If the swing arm lever bushing is
shot and the tie-rods marginal, then you are out some cash.  $330 in parts
from Ronnie plus the $200 steering box, tool rental from the bus boys,
sandblasting, POR15ing, and the whole front experience set me back a $1000.
$500 is what it takes if you do a sh*tty
I-don't-care-what-it-looks-like-when-I'm-done approach.  If your kingpins
are shot, that will be more as mine were okay and didn't need replacing.
Good luck finding a new set too if you need them.

As for the rear end - new trans $400 (+shipping) and a completey new set of
reduction box bearings are $380 to $400 in your favourite oriental flavour.

I'm not impressed with the body although it looks like low rust but maybe
high bondo content.   Interior did look nice though - wish I had it in mine.

If the mechanicals were all redone and sweet as could be, $2800 would be a
bargain.  If you need to replace the mechanicals or work on them, this bus
would be worth about $750 to $1000 tops.  If the mechanicals in one end are
fine and shot in the other, then it becomes a $1500 to $1800 bus TOPS IMHO.
$2800 is too much for a Westy that needs mechanical work done.  You can
really find better for the money.  I see them quite often.

Keep in mind that these prices I've quoted for my bus repairs is with me
doing the labor - these figures are just for the parts.  Double those
figures if you
want to factor in paid labor.  Don't believe me?  Go get some quotes for the
SAME
amount and quality of work I did.  It'll open your eyes fast.
