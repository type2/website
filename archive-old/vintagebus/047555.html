THe mesh platinum really can change dramatically with age.  The silvery 
colour turns tan. or copper, sometimes even a deep burnished bronze.  Think 
it depends on exposure to sunlight.  One bus will show variations in the 
colour, even in the same panel.  I was surprised when it was pointed out to 
me how silvery it really was originally, from those bits tucked behind.

I think that TMI made it more coppery/tan than original on purpose.  kinda 
wierd.
