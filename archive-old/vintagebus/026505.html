&gt; As for Todd Hill, I thought he had gotten square with everyone before he

&gt; owed should be the only folks with any right to be slamming him???

Jack,
I'd sure like to get my $300 back from Todd and I know of others that are
waiting for their money and/or transaxles to date and I still have that line
in my signature file.  Also, I hope what I have done has not come across as
&quot;slamming him&quot;, only presenting the facts.
