Subject: [VB] steering arm fix help


To the list

I have been examining the front end of my 66,  I think I have located the 
major problem of my streering wheel play.

The steering arm that comes from the box and goes to the drag link has a tie

rod on each end.  The tie rod that connects to the steering box is 
adjustable the tie end that hooks up to the drag link is pressed on.

This brings me to my problem, I need to replace this press on tie rod end, 
it is worn badly. How does one do this?  Is the hold rod replaced?

Thanks for your helpful hints
