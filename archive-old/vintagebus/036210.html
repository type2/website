&lt;&lt; Depending upon how badly the crank and flywheel were mangled, a
 machinist might be able to drill new dowel pin holes in the crank and
 flywheel, or you might need new parts. In any case, a complete engine
 teardown is needed. &gt;&gt;

Chances are when things cut loose the flywheel danced on the rear main bearing
making future attempts at setting the end play darn near impossible.  Skip
short cuts and drop a crank in it.
