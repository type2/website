Looking for info here. =20
1.Is it true that a double cab truck has no 'treasure chest' under the =
bed?  It appears the rear bench would be in the way, but did any years =
have a small place to stash stuff?=20
2. Is there a double cab-specific roof rack available or do dc owners =
just adapt standard racks?=20
3. What is the deal with the metal around the DC rear window?  kinda =
looks like 4 triangle stamps in the metal coming to a point.  Is this =
finding a  factory marking or some custom crap?
4. Are safari windows any better than they were 10 yrs ago? When the =
repros came out, everyone complained about them cracking if you drive =
with them even slightly open.  Are there any good ones available today? =
When closed, is leaking a problem in the rain?=20
5. Does anyone have a nice 58-61 double cab they would like to sell to a =
good home?=20
Thank you!
J
