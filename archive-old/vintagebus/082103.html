Subject: Re: [VB] Re: tires

Nobody ever talks about cheap tires.  I go to my
Peerless Tire Store and get their cheapest (used to be
second cheapest) tires in a 205/75R15 with a load
rating over 1700 lbs.  It's called a President II.  In
ten years or more of driving thousands of miles, I've
had one flat and that was a road hazard deal.  People
can tell you that I drive all over the country and
never have had a problem.

I really appreciate a set of tires that are under $200
maounted and balanced.  (When I first started buying
these I didn't even balance them.)

My main problem is that I drive so many different
busses, they're more likely to sun rot than wear out.
