&lt;&lt; The last time I &quot;restored&quot; a set, I simply took them to the chrome shop,
where the chromed them without taking them apart - looked like 600 bucks
(the price of NOS ones) when they were done.
 &gt;&gt;

600$?
Is that the same world where binz's sell for 15K and rusty deluxes sell for 
25?
