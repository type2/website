&gt; Hello again!
&gt; 
&gt; I finally got my muffler on the Bus.  I ended up buying a tiny (2 ton
&gt; rated) bottle jack.  I put the muffler over the right side head studs
&gt; and put a nut on loosely to hold it.  Then, I put the bottle jack
&gt; between the left frame rail and the left muffler flange casting, with
&gt; the ram on the frame rail.  I pumped the jack until the flange holes
&gt; lined up with the studs, then used a hammer and a drift (OK, a
&gt; screwdriver) to push the flange down over the studs.  Put the nuts
&gt; on all around and it tightened up just fine.

How much pressure did you have to put on the muffler to get it into place?
I'd be a bit worried that the continuous force on the head might cause
a problem if it is 100+ pounds  the barrel studs aren't under that much
torque, especially with small studs.

I had a similar problem with a manifold (mexican, never again!) getting
the heat riser to align.  I ended up heating and bending the left
connection to make it align properly.

Personally, if it was an alignment problem involving the cylinder studs, I
would have seriously considered rejecting the part.  There's just no
reason for this part to fit badly, since it is easily constructed on a
jig.
