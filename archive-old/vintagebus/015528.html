I saw one at the spring BogORama.  $10, laying in the hot sun like
and unfortunate flounder at low tide.  &quot;What would I ever need a panel mat 
for?&quot; sez I...

&gt; I think they made it in two pieces and glued them together, rather than in one piece like the originals, and yes you can tell it was made that way.  Then again in spite of it not being perfect, at least there is something out there.   And just try finding an original VW panel van cargo mat.  I have seen a couple.
