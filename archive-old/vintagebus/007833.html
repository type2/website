A listee gave me the information to answer my question, it is in fact a
50-52 Barndoor Bus ebrake cable, was NOS but a friend attempted to put it
into a '54 Bus, where it was too long.

Anybody need one?  Trades?

I was also informed of another party with an NOS pair of 50-52 cables that
are still available, in case a set is needed.

Thanks,

&gt; Hi, I have an NOS e-brake cable in my possession that I am trying to
figure
&gt; out what it fits, I measured it as ~3257 mm (128.25 inches).  It is the
&gt; early type with the grease fitting on it.
&gt;
&gt; It is pretty close to:
&gt; 211 609 721 - Cable - rear brake (length 3264mm) - up to Chassis _at_ 20 -
041
&gt; 711
&gt;
&gt; That would be a cable for a real early Barndoor, up to December, 1952.
&gt;
&gt; Maybe for a Split-Window Bug?
