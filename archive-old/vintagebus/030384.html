&gt;... should check out the UK based '51 Standard on Everett's site.
At today's exchange rate the price is $6,555.73 plus shipping to the US.

Ummm, http://finance.yahoo_dot_com/m5?a=3650&amp;s=GBP&amp;t=USD says that L3650 is
US $5332.28

(Sorry, I can't make the right L at this time)

Did I miss something?
