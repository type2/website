Hey, anybody know wher I can find the 55-63 front wheel cylinders (part

#211 611 069/070) for less than the usual $30-$35? Are there any rebuild

kits for these things? What is the part number if so, and where can I get

these if I need them? Just a few questions I know somebody else is

wondering about too.

in 90 or 91 when I was driving my 59 bus &quot;Gus&quot; around Oregon the brakes were
acting funny.  I was on the coast, after going down 199 from grants pass to
Crescent city and down hwy 1 or 101 or whatever it is and just north of Arcata
the brakes completely failed nope nothing no pedal all fluuid gone.  Well, I
had a hand brake and limped into town, annoying the people piled up behind me
that I only went twenty mph, which is all I felt safe with with just the hand
brake.   anyway the long and the short of it is that at that time I was able
to get rebuild kits for 55-63 front wheel cylinders- the local shophad to
order them from the warehouse in another town so it wa sthe next day I got
them but we met some people and went berry picking and it was good fun.  and
oh yeah the rubber hose front right had clogged and burst !!! so  I learned
about rubber brake hoses the hard way.  good thing it wasn't when I was going
DOWN the mountains.   So look around.
