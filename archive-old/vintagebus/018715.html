F is the end.

(0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 a b c d e f)

Or am I the only one who talks this way?

&gt; Not to get off on a tangent but 9 is the end and 0 is the beginning of
&gt; any numbering system. At least in this known universe. Hence 2000 is the
&gt; starting point and when 2001 comes about, the 21st century will have
&gt; completed it's first full year. Like fractions. You start with 0 then go
&gt; through a fractional series in order of one decimal point greater than
&gt; the last to get to 1.   i.e.  0, .25, .5, .75, 1.0. Time is no different
&gt; in numbering than any other measurement. :)
