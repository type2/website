&gt; Is there a site with descriptions or pictures of wheels for Busses?  Sort of 
&gt; a &quot;Wheels Through The Ages&quot;? 

Hi Jeff,
#1. All VW stock wheels have a manufacture date code stamped on them and ealy 
rims have even the manufacture stamped on them.

#2.  All 15&quot; wheels were for later half of 1955 through early 1964 model 
buses.  Though there were some 15&quot; rims made later for replacement parts.

#3. The only main differances between 15&quot; bus rims is the crows foot rims 
made before about 1960.  Non-crows foot rims do not have the raised 
strengthing ribs in a radial pattern outward from each lug bolt and each have 
a differant length slits between the inner and outer portions of the rim.  

Where are you located?  We have plently of 14&quot; wide five lug bus rims for 
trade!
