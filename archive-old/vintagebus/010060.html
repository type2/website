&gt; I like having magnetic plugs in the bottom of the RGBox, though.

Same here Clara.  That's one good thing to salavage from old trannies that
have bit the dust is the plugs.  I've saved these plugs over the few years
that I've been into VWs.  I changed tranny fluid in the bus last night and
all 3 bottom plugs are magnetic.  The reduction boxes didn't show me any
wear but the trans had a little metallic sediment in it.  Nothing but normal
wear.
