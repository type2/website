Are you kidding me!?   John and Jill Uphill.  Is this a updated nursery
rhyme.  Hope you plan to camp with us at the Buskatier campout for the MoKan
show.

&gt; Hi people,
&gt; Are the Johnson&quot;s and the Moore's buses planning a trip to the Bug
&gt; Blitz/Bus Blast on Memorial weekend in Kansas? Whew!
&gt; Would like to meet you bus people.
&gt;    I hope to be there, although I need to be in NM or Colorado kayaking
&gt; and mountain biking.
&gt; What type of transaxle and engine are you running?
&gt; Enjoy your buses.
