motor and pull over to the verge.  ^#%&amp;^*#! Grab the church key and a rag
and head towards the back. Oil is coming out!  from around the oil
cooler.  hm, unscrew filter all the way (there is already a puddle of
oil, WTF)seal didn't blow out, quickly screw it back on, tighter, and add
a quart of oil to bring it up to level.  Carry on, seemed okay.  Guess
the filter worked loose?   Had last changed it at the end of July, using
30 sae Castrol. 2000 miles ago. On these cold mornings the pressure is
pretty high- like pegs the 70-psi guage above idle.

Is there a relief valve to bypass the filter when the pressure is too
high?  If not, there should be one built into the filter.  Perhaps the
filter isn't the right one?
