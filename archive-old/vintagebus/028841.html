It is not unheard of for the t/o bearing cross shaft to fail.  Another
possibility is a stretched clutch cable.

&gt; The weird thing is this:  When I do manage to get it into gear, it feels

&gt; down, and ugly noises ensue (some of them from me).  Once in motion, the
&gt; shifting is almost normal, (I do rpm matching to the best of my ability
&gt; anyway), but there is still some feeling that the clutch isn't disengaging
&gt; the tranny from the engine.....  Has anyone else ever felt this?
&gt; Is it possible that my clutch/throwout bearing have some kind of latch on
&gt; the input shaft?  There is something unnatural going on when the bus is in
&gt; neutral and I push in the clutch....T/O?
&gt; BTW the howling I was hearing before I changed the tranny oil (85-90 wt
&gt; GL-4) has lessened.
