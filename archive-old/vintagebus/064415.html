Subject: Fw: [VB] JCWhitney or Harbor Freight

VWBill on the VintageVW list used to work at or for the company in Chicago
 that is JC Whitney.  Until a few years ago there stuff was kaka but he said
 last year that there quality had gone up considerably since and this was
 after he had quit and moved to CA.  But myself haven't ordered anything but
 eyebrows and rain guards (chrome) for my bus.  I do have a 72 westy fat
 chick!! (Thank Kyle for that one) along with the 61 23 and the 66 SC

 All journeys end when we reach our destination
 but the journeying remains a thing apart,
  unique unto itself.
 Most of us make life's journeys without
 understanding that the
 journeying is a separate thing.

&gt; &gt; I've NEVER seen anything from JCWhipme that I would
&gt; &gt; buy sight unseen, and I'm embarrassed to say that I
&gt; &gt; have purchased a few things from Harbor Freight since
&gt; &gt; they opened a store in Albuquerque, but only upon
&gt; &gt; personal inspection, and still was upset at my
&gt; &gt; purchases about half the time.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Why aren't people willing to spend the money for REAL
&gt; &gt; tools???

&gt; &gt; PS Got my tie-rod end puller from
&gt; &gt; hazetguy_at_earthlink_dot_net for a substantial amount, but
&gt; &gt; it hasn't failed me yet.
