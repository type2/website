&lt;&lt; Hey all,
 
 Hope everyone had a good weekend.  How difficult is it to change a tranny 
 boot with the engine still in (66 bignut)?  Also how much have people seen 
 side steps going for.  Sorry for that question, I'm sure I'll get heckled, I 
  &gt;&gt;

well, put you cap on, slide underneath with a drain pan, rags, a screwdriver 
and a razor blade.   put pan under axle boot, undo the two hose clamps, cut 
old boot off with razor blade, wiper tranny where boots go on clean with rag

get new boot with ittle washers and nuts/bolts, attache to bus, a fashlight 
doesn't hurt.  wrap boot around axle, insert and screw on nuts/bolts/washers, 
turn the seam at a angle up, not straight up or flat.  attach hose clamps, 
and tighten bolts but not too tighte.  some people use sealer at the seam.

repeat other side.

it is easier with motor out, but you can do it with motor in.   You may want 
to change your gear oil if it has been many 10ks of miles, or if you feel 
like there are other reasons to pull the motor (engine to body seal, new fuel 
line, maybe your main seal or oil cooler seals are old) do that.

haven't seen a lot of side steps going recently.  I sold one probably cheap 
at about $50, at least it went as soon as I unloaded it at the swap.
