Subject: Re: [VB] help on engine black paint

David-
I use a high temperature powdercoat
product for engine tin application.
When paint is required, consider
PPG DP-90 epoxy primer.
It is standard shelf material.
DuPont doesn't have a match.
It is a quality product suitable for
a finish resistant to oil and gas,
and has the factory look.

&gt; I'm getting ready to paint some engine tin and I went down to my paint
&gt; friends shop yesterday to discuss the possibilities.  Powder coating is
&gt; definitely OUT of the question as I really dislike the plastic coat look.
I
&gt; asked him for something gas and oil resistant and he suggested some Dupont
&gt; product but continued to say it too ended up quite thick.
