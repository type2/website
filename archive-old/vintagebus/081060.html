Subject: jerome... dog friendly?

ok, from what i can see, jerome is basically a flat spot of dirt 
where you camp. any one bring dogs in the past, and was the heat/sun 
a problem? is there shade at all? i would rather leave the dog at 
home, but the last time i left him for a weekend, he panicked - vomit 
and poop ALL over the house. plus a $400 vet bill for emergency room 
rehydration and a follow-up.  so he might have to come, convenient or 
not. he's well-behaved, so that's not the problem; but a black dog in 
the AZ sun is not always a good idea.
