&lt;&lt; hello group!
 
 I am getting ready to replace my freeway flier with a stock geared trans
 and was wondering, do i need to take apart the reduction boxes to get
 the axle tubes off the axles?
 
 ive pulled trannies before, but i always kept the axles on, but now i
 need to pull the axles and put them on the new trans, and have heard
 both ways (you can leave them on, and, you have to take the redux boxes
 apart to do it). but no for sure answers from anyone.
 
 any things to look out for?  it seems like a pretty straight forward
 process, but if i can get away with leaving the boxes alone, i'd prefer
 it (they were completely gone through about two years ago when my father
 was holding the bus ransom)
  &gt;&gt;
yes you must take the RGBoxes apart to remove them and the tubes and axles 
from the tranny center section.  If you are going to do this (and if you have 
changed a transaxle why not) I remcommend getting a copy of the bentley 
reprint of the transporter workshop manual 1963 edition, covers 63-67 buses 
and shows in detail this procedure.   Also get a pair of -big- snap ring 
pliers for the circlip holdiong the thrust washer and crown gear in the 
tranny.

It is fairly straightforward.
