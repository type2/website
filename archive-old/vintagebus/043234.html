Tom you're right...my reply was TOO generic....I'm stuck in the early '60s
to mid '50s.  The 40horse crank won't fit 12V flywheels.
A bit of machining and it's a go.
Is that better?
Thanks

&gt; NOT TRUE!!  The difference is in the crankshaft diameter between a 40-horse
&gt; and a 1300/1500/1600.  The 40-horse has a larger diameter crankshaft than
&gt; the later engines.  Just b/c a flywheel is 6-volt, doesn't mean it's
&gt; necessarily off of a 40-horse.
