Subject: Re: [VB] Rear Hatch Pin

From: &quot;Chris Sullivan&quot; &lt;csullivan_at_oceanit_dot_com&gt;

&gt; Anyone out there know where I can get a pin for the rear hatch
&gt; ('65/equiv) with that rounded rectangular head on it?  And if there's
&gt; any tricks for getting those torsion springs back I'd sure like to know....

There is a long one and a short one.
Which one do you need?
I went thru the 'replace the broken spring' fun about 6 months ago. I think I
wrote about it and it may be in the archives.
