Subject: Re: [VB] &quot;funny&quot; little engine noise

Dave,
This is very close to our failure on the way to the Red barn a year and 
a half ago.
[VB] Dead on the road 4/9/2003 12:10 PM
&quot;Turns out the gland nut backed off the front of the engine and has 
wallowed out the 4 dowel holes in the crank and flywheel.&quot;
End story
[VB] P &amp; C back on the road again 4/10/2003 9:35 PM
&quot;Well long story short, we had minimal damage.  Dan, of Bug Man in 
Templeton, was able to surface the crankshaft and flywheel, install new 
dowels (yes they were pretty snug and not oversized), replace the shims 
(we can show you the concave ones we removed), and torqued a Super HD 
gland nut to 400ftlbs.  The engine went back in nicely with no further 
mishaps and started like a trooper.  ..... and head for BYOB.&quot;
Look in the archives for longer story.
We have completed many a mile(s) on that 'Temp fix'

the engine and found the flywheel was loose!
