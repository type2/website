&gt;  I've seen some ads on the samaba for fleetlines recently,
that were in africa and they seem to be 74s or 75s, ya a 15
window '74 splitty in south africa.

&gt;
&gt;  So some were made in africa in 74? too.   and then in 76
in brazil they went to the hybrid bay nose on a splitty body
with the high hinge barndoor style but sturdy and reinforced
cargo doors?  how long were those made?
&gt;
&gt;
All the Fleetlines I've seen advertised for sale online are
from the South African production. VW Relics in the UK
www.vwrelics claim to soon be getting five of them. I know
they have a couple of scalpers working for them out of
Pretoria; buying up all the buses and parts they can lay
their hands on. There are a lot of nice old cars in
Pretoria, where they appreciate old things and the climate
is high and dry.

I think some of the SA Fleetlines are claimed to be 74s
because the registration papers note the year of first
liability for registration, not the year model. Most people
here, including licensing authorities, VWSA, and so-called
air-cooled experts, really haven't a clue about old buses.

The bay-split hybrid was built here from 76-78. SA-assembled
German-built bays were sold here to 1981. I've heard
production figures of 2000 Brazilian bay-split hybrids, but
that may include the 789 splits or may not, or may even be
totally wrong. I get the figure of 789 '75 Fleetlines from
an old copy of the locally compiled Commercial Vehicle Data
Digest. VWSA have no historical or production records
available whatsoever.

It is possible that some Fleetlines may have been assembled
in Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe) in the mid-70s, but I've never
been able to verify this. I do know that there seemed to be
quite a few of them in Zim in the 80s. They may also have
been assembled in Nigeria, but those would have been LHD.
And only the South African production were saddled with the
meaningless name of Fleetline. I'd love to know how VWSA
came to calling them that.
