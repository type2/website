Subject: extrabeepy horn fixed
Cc: type2_at_type2_dot_com

A loooooooooong day resulted in my finally fixing my too-noisy horn; as
some may recall, it had begun to beep when the steering wheel was turned,
and I had ALREADY done the replace-the-wire-and-even-put-straws-on-it
thing.

As crazy as it sounds, I was right: it was the ignition switch;
specifically, the ignition lock.
There is  - or was  - a plastic bushing that fits betwen the steering shaft
and the column that the steering  shaft resides in, and that has a little
hole where the column lock protrudes; this had gone The Way Of All Things.
The column lock (a small metal bar) was making a ground between the shaft,
the column and the housing for the ignition switch when the wheel was
turned, as the lack of this bushing (and resulting wear on the others)
allowed the whole assembly to flex. Figure 9-12 of the Front End section in
my Bentley shows the various bushings; the ignition stuff isn't in the
Bentley, I found pictures in a reprint of a VW parts manual, and in the T2
library (&quot;early baywindow ignition switch&quot; or some such).

I took the entire ignition assembly out ( a pain) and removed the column
lock by grinding it off. This was a little odd, as I prefer to keep things
stock, but I never liked that little thing anyways. Locked the wheel up on
me once when I went to restart the motor while driving :P  Next, I took a
sheet of THICK rubber and cut a 2&quot; tall section of it to fit the column;
this was glued to the column, and the ignition housing, bearing, bushings,
turnswitch housing etcetc were put back on. Even got to take that little
bit of misalignment outta the steering wheel's positioning :)


No horn beeps except when I want them, turn signals cancel properly...
nothing caught fire when I hooked the battery back up =)

I found that a key factor was having the steering housing screwed TIGHTLY
to the support that resides beneath it; the slightest looseness will cause
the column to flex, the bushings to wear, and the horn to beep.

If this all seems coherent enough, cool... maybe it should be added to my
description of how to fix the horn wire in the T2 Library?
