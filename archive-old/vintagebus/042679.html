&gt; I took a drive in a *****NICE**** 65 firetruck....that bus drives like its 
&gt; BRAND NEW!!!!!
&gt; I was amazed, It is also currently for sale on the VW planet website. Too 
&gt; cool.

Not that it matters much....

But this bus was recently purchased by the seller for just over $4,000 US

Im sure he could have put $5,000 into it in the past 3 weeks, but i kinda
doubt it.  if you want to buy it maybe that will give you some room for
negotiation.

anyway, that is all...
