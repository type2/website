Hey all, I've had this 40 hp longblock on my shelf for a couple of
years. I have everything for it except a 28 PIC carb. (I'm using that on
the VolksAir) I have an aftermarket 2bbl intake manifold and the
original intake and a brand new in the plastic bus muffler. No heater
boxes. The generator has a new VR still in the box. It's nice and clean,
a little dusty, but needs a new home since it's the last 40 hp on the
shelf. It's a 65 by the block numbers. I'm asking only $300 for it and
am throwing in a box of 40 hp tin and parts with it. It's in the Puget
Sound area (Seattle) and I might be able to deliver it if it's within 50
miles.
