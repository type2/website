Subject: Re: [VB] Speedo cable lube

Hi Harry,
Also adding some graphite mixed into the white lithium grease helps to keep 
things lubed even when the grease eventually turns to so much clay and no 
longer lubricates properly by itself.  WD-40 should only be used as a 
loosener of stuck parts and once moving a heavier oil or grease or 
grease/graphite is needed to keep lubricating after the WD-40 has evaporated 
about a week or less!   Eric&amp;Barb
