well, then, here are my stats.  I took longer than John Howard did, but I was 
also visiting family in the Bay Area.  on the way down the roof rack was 
empty.  On the way back, I had (still have) a bunch of stuff on the rack, 
including a Sunfish sailboat.  This made the bus corner with considerably 
less verve and elan, in fact dern badly when in SF.    I drove mostly 60mph 
on the way down.  And out of concession to the the ambient heat (above 85) 
from California's Central Valley through southern Oregon on the way up, 
closer to 55. (of course excepting up the steep mountains)

miles.. 1904
gas..  79.6 gallons
average MPG   23.9
gas cost $140.96

best gas milage was going S 101 between Eureka and Ukiah (26.3), worst was 
from driving around the Bay Area,  short trips kind of  thing. 

I may do a long boring trip report including the backroads camping, the slow 
leak in the tire, Visting Gene and Michele, jamming to janice and watching 
wildflowers, fixing my right taillight, playing leapfrog with the truckers in 
the mountains, losing 1st and 2nd gears,  etc etc etc.     Oh ya, a couple VW 
shows too, but you can go see the pics now.  But I just got home, so the long 
version waits.
