Subject: Re: [VB] Bottom tin opinions - Revisited

I guess i should clarify,
when i said 'useless' it was in reference to me and the other guys
discussion as to wether or not it actually *cool's* the engine and if it
would cause overheating if removed along with the thermostat.

&gt;
&gt; if VW didn't think there was a need for the
&gt; engine to have tin below the cylinders, they sure as he!! wouldn't have
put them
&gt; there. think of the millions of $$ they would have saved over the years
by not
&gt; putting them there. who cares what they do?
&gt;
&gt; i'd rather have a $2 piece of tin stopping rocks
&gt; rather than a pushrod puking oil and not knowing it until it was too
&gt; late.
&gt;
&gt; i (personally) also think they help cooling by
&gt; actually directing the air somewhere (away from the engine) rather than
just
&gt; having large, open spaces underneath for the air to go nowhere. if it
were an
&gt; issue of keeping the engine &quot;warm&quot; for the thermostat, they would have
only put
&gt; them on the one side, again saving $$. i mean, c'mon, every aircooled
engine had
&gt; the darn things, even industrial engines which don't see much rock
throwing.
&gt; they are obviously there for a reason!
&gt;
&gt; geez, call me a vintage nazi, but it's
&gt; ridiculous not to run them. why not just get a ceiling fan, wire it up
for 12V,
&gt; mount it above the engine, remove ALL cooling tin and cool it that way
&gt; instead.
&gt;

&gt; Looking for opinions on the bottom tin...the pieces that attach to the
&gt; case
&gt;
&gt; and the heater boxes.  The local shop owners believe them to be
&gt; gravel
&gt;
&gt; guards to protect the push rod tubes from flying rocks.  Others
&gt; think you
&gt;
&gt; have to run EVERY piece of the tin in order for the complete system
&gt; to
&gt;
&gt; work.
