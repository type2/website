Subject: RE: Praise for The List and it's Keepers

&gt; I just HAVE to tell all of the people who are instrumental in keeping
&gt; this mailing list going what a terrific job you do.
-SNIP-
&gt; going on there! They have no moderator so ANYTHING GOES! All week they
-SNIP-
&gt; Anyway, just had to give plenty of praise where it's due. You guys
&gt; (Thom, Ken, Stephen et al) make this list what it is. THANKS!!!
&gt; 
Sorry, I know this is a Friday topic, but I'm playing catch-up and this
wanted to underscore Michele's message. You guys do a great job with
this list, and I appreciate it. For any of you listees that have not
subbed to other lists, it can be _really_ bad. Some lists are down all
the time. Some of the moderated lists are really somebody's little
dictatorship to make them feel important.

This list is WONDERFUL for content and only occasionally do the admins
step in to control the discussion... I hope I don't get &quot;moderated&quot; for
posting this on Sunday. 

Thanks again for the List, to the Thom, Ken, Steve (Type2), George, and
to all of you that contribute the content (I'm also on some _really
slow_ lists!). And MERRY SOLSTICE, CHRISTMAS, HANUKAH, or whatever you
choose to celebrate to y'all!
