&gt;Installing my 1776 this evening. It'll have a pict 34 on it, jets
&gt;drilled out by Fisher Buggies (not sure which numbers on my reciept mean
&gt;what). Will my '67 oilbath work, or will I need to use one of those
&gt;tacky aftermarket paper filters?


By any chance, do you have the sizes that they bored your jets out to?
Sounds to me like that would be some good info to have in case anyone else
wanted to modify their 34PICT to work with a higher displacement engine.  As
for oilbath filters, the dual horn setup should breath adequately.  You are
only going to be able to pass so much air through that carb anyway...
