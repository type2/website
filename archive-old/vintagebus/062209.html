Subject: Re: [VB] Someone stole my engine?

I once repossessed a motor out of this guy's bus.  In broad daylight, with 
neighbors around.  We had a deal in which he had got my spare engine, but he 
kept lagging on handing over the cash, so I took the engine back.  Funny 
thing was he had a locking engine compartment, but I got around that. 
:)
