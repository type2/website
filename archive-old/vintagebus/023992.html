Subject: 51/67 Chrome Front Emblems

Clara, I know I might be wrong on years, but I don't care because this
can save some money for people. Richard and Cindy from Vintage Motor
Works, Inc ( the nice folks who repoduce the VW tool boxes and the BUS
front emblems ) are having a VWHOWARD sale on their Chrome VW bus front
emblems ( 3 pin or 4 pin  ). They will sell 2 chrome front
emblems 3 or 4 pin for $60.00 plus $5.00 S&amp;H for both until Sept 15,1998
The normal price is $39.00 each plus $5.00 S&amp;H. You and a friend or get
2 for yourself can save a bunch. These are repo but try and find a
perfect original chrome front emblem for $32.50 each! with shipping 
included ( If you get 2 ). I am not involved with VMW,I. I have bought
from them and the quality is great and the price is right. Plus richard
said if the VWHOWARD sale sells 500 emblems he will give me 1 for free.
He is committed to this price untill 9/15/98 so mention the VWHOWARD
sale for the good price. Contact them at: www.roundboxtools_dot_com and say
VWHOWARD sent you and I will donate my free chrome emblem at the Jerome
Jam 8 raffle. Thanks
John Howard
