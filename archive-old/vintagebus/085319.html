Subject: A new engine.

Hi,

Not sure too many of you folks will like this one. I am looking into doing a 
Subaru engine transplant into my 64DD delivery bus/camper. I'm just tired of 
the noise and vibration of the air cooled. First criteria is that the engine 
must fit without cutting any metal off the engine compartment in case I 
don't like it and want to go back. The exterior of the bus cannot be altered 
either. I will have to cut the bolt in rear skirt to fit the cam pulleys.

Anyone out there have experience with doing this sort of transplant? I am 
looking into an EJ22 engine. 2.2 liters, 140hp.  I will get a beefed up 
trans with a 3.44 r&amp;p to handle the extra power. I have found a fair amount 
of info on the web, especially from the Ausie mates. Seems they have done a 
few of them in bay buses. Two problems as I see it, the radiator and heater. 
Where do they go? A custom radiator could be installed on the side opposite 
the battery, however air flow could be a problem. I would not know until its 
installed and run. Being a DD, there is a belly pan that eliminates the 
underside for the radiator. The hollow area under the floor are actually not 
a bad location in a non-DD.

Outback Motor Sports (www.outbackmotors_dot_com) is not far from me and I have 
talked to them. They do dune buggies and specialize in Subaru's modified for 
hi power.

Constructive comments please.

Thanks,
Chris
