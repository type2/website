today I was pleasently supprised to find that&gt; regular
gas has dropped to&gt; $1.50 a gallon, last week it was
$1.69 at the same&gt; location. Does anybody&gt; else see
this trend in falling fuel prices. If they&gt; keep
dropping I might&gt; make even more long distance road
trips to VW shows.&gt; &gt; &gt; ronnie&gt; &gt; &gt;
