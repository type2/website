Subject: Re: [VB] 56-63 wheel cylinder symposium

Hi Steve, 
The original brake cylinders sold on VWs and through VW up to about 1970ish 
would have a VW symbol cast into them.  ATE made them for VW and those made 
later without VW symbol would be also NOS.  The former would be NOS VW the 
latter would be NOS ATE for VW.
