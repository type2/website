&lt;&lt;  I noticed that I am missing one of the bolts that bolts the spring plate

Hi JDD,
Best to drill and tap the holes deeper and install bolts.  Because the stock 
bolts have been loose the RGB threads are worn even more and now most likely 
will totally fail if you retorque in the stock 24mm length bolts.  If we 
remember correctly we install 35mm long ones in ours and any others when 
taking apart or installing RGBs as a standard practice after having way too 
many times at least one if not two stock length bolts strip out when 
installing RGB bus tranny after tranny.  
  If drilling and tapping deeper still strips out the threads you will have 
to redrill slightly bigger diameter holes and get a 12 x 1.5mm insert kit and 
inserts from Time-Sert:  http://www.timesert_dot_com/sprksert.htm   .  They had a 
30mm long special order inserts we were able to get one time and another time 
we inquired they were out of these.  Hopefully they have them again and if 
someone finds out we would like to know so we can stock up on more of them.
   With the stock RGB to swing plate 24mm length bolts and 5mm thick swing 
plates and at least 1mm thick lock washers you only end up with about 18mm 
length of thread on eacdh of the four bolts per side holding the entire rear 
of the bus up!
  With the 35mm length bolt and same thickness lock washers and swing plate 
you have 29mm length of threads on each bolt!  Which is over 50% more threads 
and thusly more holding strength.     Eric&amp;Barb
