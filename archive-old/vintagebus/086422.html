.......  Now buses have a high nostalga factor

Yes, but w/ inflation in 10 or 20 years $20-30K probably will be like buying
a $1500 project bus now?

&gt; Without having done any research at all - I bet - the price of a desireable
&gt; car - say a 57 chevy does not go for what it did a few years ago - that 40
&gt; to 60 demographic has passed - or is passing by.

Tom-prices never seem to go back to where they were 5 years ago.
