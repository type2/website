In a bizarre turn of events, our trip to get a single cab or 2 ended up with
not getting any single cab and an excercise in bleeding the hydraulic clutch
on a Mazda B2200.

I arrived in Omaha Saturday evening around 7:30 to the light of a big bright
full moon.  Zac and Amanda Robbins were my hosts and so I prompt ushered
inside and fed a great spaghetti and tomato sauce meal with salad on the
side and a deliciously topped ice cream with Zac's secret recipe.  It's neat
that after all the times I've treated listees out, to have the favour
returned in such a gracious way.  I enjoyed the company of Zac and Amanda -
and I hope they enjoyed mine (I pulled out the guitar and forced them to
listen.) :-)

Zac and I read some email, played an arcade game he has in the basement (I'm
a child of the 80's and love the old arcade games!) and later got a game
plan in action for how to proceed Sunday morning.  I slept like a baby and
on the coldest morning yet this year, we departed after an awesome
organically based pancake and syrup breakfast totally prepared by Zac.  I
can live with this kind of treatment. :-)

The trip to Des Moines was a quick 2.5 hrs while Zac and I told fish stories
about the VW that got away, etc.  We also came up with some good ideas for
home made dual carb setups - amongst other things.

Upon arrival, we checked both single cabs out.  The road worthy one is mild
to rough shape but the major problem are the redux box bolts.  The passenger
side was missing one bolt and the other 3 were 3 different sizes of which
one was 9/16&quot;  Removing the only stock bolt in this side revealed that the
whole box was loose on that side.  Zac started feeling some bad karma about
the bus and so he made the decision to not buy the bus.  The other bus is a
total basket case.  It's got the 15&quot; rims but there is major major rust and
sections of the body have been hacked out.  This is what a parts bus is.
The redux boxes on it though appear to have never been touched which is a
good sign.

Anyway, we made the trip home but not after having to replace the fluid in
the hydraulic clutch assembly on the Mazda (we were mislead into thinking we
had fluid in the reservoir when in reality, it was the stain of the old
fluid we saw.  Hydraulic clutches do require fluid in order tow work.) :-)

After we got home, I called Rob Laffoon and Terry Wolfe and met them both at
Terry's house (but not after I made a ton of wrong turns getting there.)
Terry's bus is something now that makes me jealous.  A TON of time has been
spent on this bus - he's got new cargo floors, out riggers, all jack points
are kosher, etc.  I took some pix which will get posted - it looks like this
65 is lucky to have Terry for it's owner.  Words alone won't do justice for
this bus.  You need to see how it was before and compare it to now to
appreciate just what Terry and Dick Bozarth have done - it's a VERY pristine
and fine job.

So we said our good-bye's after cutting the visit short. I wanted to spend
more time at Terry's but obligations and time just wouldn't allow for it.
Rob was kind enough to lead me all around Omaha so we could find his house.
There I spent my 2nd night and enjoyed a belly full of Taco Bell, saw tons
of Robs VW toys/accessories, played guitar with Joe from down the street,
played the drums, piano, and xylephone, and surfed the web and looked at
pictures until at 2:00 a.m., I couldn't stay awake.  I was escorted to a
waterbed and that was the last I saw of Rob.  Both he and his son Justin had
to leave early so I had the house to myself this morning.  I finally left
about 9:00 and went to Zac's to get some stuff I forgot and made it home
this morning at 11:05.  It was a nice change of pace to kick back and enjoy
bumming around with Zac, Rob, and Justin (Rob's son.)  Justin is a neat kid
and will be the next generation VW nut.  He's an 8th grader and is always
with dad where ever he goes.  I always look forward to meeting Justin
because he's a really bright kid and we share a mutual interest (aside from
VWs) in LEGO engines (see my web page for an explanation.)

I feel privileged to have been well boarded and fed by Zac, Amanda, Rob, and
Justin and to have been in the company of all of them plus Terry as well.
I'm looking forward to the next trip up there.  VW people are cool.
