I agree: a good chunk of the value of these speciality
cars is having all of the pieces that make it such.

For instance, I have a 1955 westfalia.  But is it
really a westfalia?  Doesn't have much, if any, of the
real westfalia stuff, so in cold brutal honesty it's
a 1955 kombi with a hatch on top.  I've even considered
welding up the hatch and making it into a kombi if
I can't find any of the westy stuff.

ya- which is why I paid a lot for a rusty outside tatty inside not running 53
bus- it was pretty durn complete.   You can spend a lot of time and money
accumulating the parts.   

Well, a westy is a combi with some cabinets in it.  but the hatch s cool.   If
you did weld it up we'd point and laugh.  :)
