Hello -
While working on a bus for a friend....

I jacked up the front tires to adjust the bearings yesterday and noticed
that there is vertical play in both front wheels. Not too much, but
noticable. I eliminated the possibility of loose bearings per Muir and
then tightened the link pins and lubed them. Still a bit of play, a
little less,though.

My question is whether SOME play is OK, I have not found mention of
tolerances with regard to the King Pin in any book.

If I have worn bushings,then, what is the best route for replacing them?
I found Wolfsburg has rebuilt ones on exchange. Anyone found a great
deal? Is it best to do rebuild them myself?

Thanks - Tim
