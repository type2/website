Subject: Re: [VB] re:overheating

&gt; So I pulled the tin from the motor that straddled where the engine and trans
&gt; meet and repeated the test. I had to get just inches away from the louvers
&gt; before it pulled the shop towel toward the louvers.

thats a bad tin to pull from a doghouse though because the hot air dumped
through the cooler to the front of the engine will be pulled back in
rather than passing under and out.
