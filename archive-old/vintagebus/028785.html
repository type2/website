Subject: From CA to NW Vintage meet...anyone???
References: &lt;20000703154354.72313.qmail_at_hotmail_dot_com&gt;

Along the lines of the previous post, is anyone driving from Southern (
Fresno/Bakersfield or parts South) CA on up to the NW Vintage Meet???   I'm in
need of some shipping help.  It would be a '62 front bench seat  that I would
need brought down.  I'm getting it from Clara, so you'd get to meet one of the
nicest listees on the West coast to boot.  I'd be more than happy to help with
part of your gas bill or a charge to have you bring it back.   P-mail me
directly if you can help me out.  I appreciate it immensely.

Thank!!

Steve
