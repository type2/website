&gt;compared to the other cylinders due to it's position.  If one times the
engine
to the proper degree for #1 using the #3 lobe all your cylinders will be
moved
up 3 degrees and which will cause overheating and possibly detonation in
all
cylinders.&lt;

Eric,
        Thanks once again for all the great info that you provide!  I must
request the next part of the question.  How is this corrected?  I have run
into this twice myself and both times it was on a T3 case that was
converted to a T1.  Is there a design difference in the longblock/dizzy of
the two?

        The way I picture it, there is only two times the #1 cylinder
reaches TDC.....one on compression stroke (both valves closed...waiting for
fire from dizzy)....and the other at the exhaust stroke (piston pushing
exhaust out open exhaust valve, closed intake valve).  Being TDC for #1 is
only reached twice....the dizzy will only have the rotor bug pointing at
the rim notch twice (that the drive will slip all the way down in).  At
least, this is what I thought.  I have found when I rotate the engine to
TDC #1, with both valves closed that the ONLY way the dizzy will go in is
with the dizzy bug pointing at #3 in many cases.  

        Why is this such a common confusion?  I mean...I understand why we
dont want to just rotate the wires on the cap and go on.

Thanks again,

Josh Rodgers,
Ponca City, OK
