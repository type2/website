My old 67 pop=top (yes pop top) Sundial was also made from a kombi and the
pop top was a little different then a Westy, it only had 2 sizzor arms
holding it up but had 4 zippered screen windows.

Hey Chad,

I used to have a Sundial that was made out of a Kombi. A lot of the
&quot;off-brand&quot; campers where made out of panels because they were cheaper to
start with. I've also heard that if you (the dealer) bought 5 commercials,
you got a Westy thrown in the deal. That's why Riviera's are almost always
panels (and dd panels!) Because the dealer bought in mass quantities for
the cheap Westy. Then he took the panels and had them converted as cheap as
possible. I got this info from VW Howard, by the way...see John...I do pay
attention when you talk! :)
