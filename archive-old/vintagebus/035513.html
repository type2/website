There is a murder mystery, &quot;Murder Crops Up&quot; with a splitty on the cover, dog 
in the passenger seat, peeking over a fence.    The main character (who is 
framed for the murder of course) has a blue VW bus in the story its a 69, on 
the cover it's a splitty.  By Lora Roberts, if you like mysteries.

Saw WinterSleepers last night, by the director of Run Lola Run, good movie, 
and early in the movie you see a nice mid sixties black bug, ya I know its 
not a bus,  but it was there.   The bug reappears.   Driven by an odd person, 
as most VWs are, stereotypically.
