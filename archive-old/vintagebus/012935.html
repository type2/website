Well I am about 3/4 of the way there, I have got to plan these trips a little
better. I left about 5 1/2 days after I wanted to leave, which meant for a
rushed trip. First leg made it to Bucaneer state park, just over the border of
Mississippi(sp). I remember stopping there going the other way, and I loved
teh beach near there. All these wooden piers sticking out in the water, each
one with a slightly different construction method, and a very different gate
on them. (hey I'm an architect I get into that sort of thing)
Unfortunately it was pissing rain, as it has been for almost the whole trip.
So I didn't get to go for a dip or hang out on the beach like i wanted to(I
love taking photos, but my camera doesn't like the rain) (although rain is an
awful excuse for not swimming).

Anyway next stop Atlanta. I was hoping to meet a 2nd cousin of mine there, but
had been unable to get in touch with him, until Wednesday morning. I actually
had not met this guy for ten years(literally). So I call him up, tell him
where I am and when I plan on getting to Atlanta. He says great, my two
daughters are coming home, you can meet more of your relations. So the time I
set up to meet him is ok, except I forgot about the time change. So I am
running about 30 minutes late, plus the hour time change, then my fanbelt
snaps. Luckily it was right near a exit ramp. So I walked up called my cousin,
told him I was running a little late. Fanbelt snapped, and he says, &quot;well how
long till they can fix it...&quot; I loved being able to say, &quot;well actually I am
probably going to fix it myself, i just thought I would call you while I
waited for the engine to cool off.&quot; I should have replaced the one that was
inthere, instead of just tightening it last week. I think it probably
stretched out over time, and that is why the rupture.

The solenoid is also acting up-I am going to look into that starter relay
installation upon return to Boston. I also met a broken down bus en route to
Atlanta(another reason for my delay). I pulled over to give the guy a hand,
but he said it was a lost cause. Nick was waiting for a tow truck, I forget
what it was that broke, but lots of oil everywhere. So all I could do for him
was stop at the next rest stop and ask for a tow truck to go out and get him,
he didn't want to leave the bus. I notice he and his wife used a squeegee
inside the bus, I think I got to get one of those, I had some pretty hairy
driving, with the windows all fogged up.

Get into atlanta, great dinner, find a place for a great guinness(can't get
that in houston). Next day up for a run around the park, off to a suburb north
of Atlanta called Big Canoe. My cousing works there, so I thought I woul check
it out. That was quite a drive, a lot of steep hills, and sharp hairpin turns,
riding out Rt53. Kind of fun for a while, but Idon't think the bus liked it
too much.

Eventually tried to make it to Greensboro to meet up with a listee. Called
early in the evening, and got a machine. Didn't actually make it to their city
until 12:30 or 1 am. Crashed at a rest stop. I thought I might try the next
morning. Next morning still pissing rain. Sorry I haven't met any listees yet.
This rain is driving me crazy. Oh yeah I forgot to mention...my front
windshields leak like crazy when on the highway in the rain. So my feet have
been swimming for the last couple of days, and I think my gas gauge got water
in it, a it is now all fogged up. First task upon return:fix the windshield
seals.

Well now I am in DC waiting around before heading over to an old
friends...hope he is home by then. like I said earlier I need to plan these
trips better. I was supposed to be here on Monday, I guess I  just need to
call my friends and let them know my arrival give or take a week.

Well I think the next stop is New Jersey, reunion with old architecture
friends...wait till the see the splittie(i hope it mkes it)

well I'll let you'all know what happens on the last legs...
