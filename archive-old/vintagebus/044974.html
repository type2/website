Steve &amp; the list,
Just a thought on putting gauges in the parcel tray. Gauges are good for
giving you more information and to do that they need to be reasonably easy to
notice. the further that they are away from your sight line, the less you will
notice them while driving and the less good that they will do. I am six foot
one, and with some 50 year old eyes and presbiopia, the parcel tray would be
in terra incognita for me. (I have mounted left over seats from a Porsche in
place of the stock seats and they are a little taller than stock.) Instead,
from where I sit, the space just above the windshield is just above my sight
line. I normally have to duck a little to see overhead stoplights. I removed
my visor on the driver's side and mounted a VDO three gauge package on the
headliner directly above my seating position. now I see the gauges (Tach, oil
temp and press) in my peripheral vision all the time, and just a glance up
gives me exact numbers. I had to take the hard rubber VDO mounting block and
angle miter it to get the gauges to be level. used a piece of wood for
practice to get the angle right, and screwed it right into the wood panel in
my Westy. I ran the wires above the wood panel (someone had previously mounted
a speaker in this panel which gave great access) and ran the wires down the
door pillar to the left of the driver's windshield. the lights fade with the
fader on the headlight switch. Works for me.
