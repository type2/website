Subject: RE: [VB] Crusty Door Seals

On the same topic, which parts of the door seals do you glue in and what
glue do you use?

Subject: [VB] Crusty Door Seals



I'm spending the evening (or whats left of it) trying to replace my front 
door and cargo door seals.  The old ones are hard and crack when I push on 
them.  I can get most of them out, but there is a thin layer of seal/glue 
still stuck to the sealing surface.  Is there a good way to get this off 
without wrecking the paint? 

Thanks, 
Isaiah
