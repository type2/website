I would assume you need a little wiggle to prevent the bearings from seizing
up once they get warm.  Places where there can be wear is in the bearing
itself, the bearing housing in the redux box (if for some reason it's
wallowed out), and even if the bearing sits loose on the stub shaft.  I
checked this stuff on my boxes and the bearings were just a tad too loose
for comfort in the redux housing so I peened them in a little bit.  I
expected them to be a little loose as the boxes have well over 210,000 miles
on them (went from California to Panama and back again twice.)
