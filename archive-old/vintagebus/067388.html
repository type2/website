Hi Stan,

To be honest it is tough to tell what is in there until you take the motor 
out.  I assume it is a T1 IRS tranny and not a Bay tranny?

Really on a IRS tranny it is hard to tell because there is an early and late 
style which is not interchangable due to the throwout arm and TO bearing 
differences.

But the engine should slid right out the rear as normal w/o needing to pull 
the tranny.  Now the oil lines and fuel stuff might be more complicated in 
your situation.

Good Luck,
Adrian Pillow
