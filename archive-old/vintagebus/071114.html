Subject: Shift Coupler - HELP!

Alright, I had to replace the shifter coupler right at the transmission on
my bus today, and I've run into a little problem.  After replacing the
coupler, I only have reverse, 1st, and 2nd gear.  Anybody have any ideas?
Is there anywhere to adjust this?  Please help, I'm supposed to go on a road
trip in my bus in about 13 hours!
