Subject: Re: [VB] Re: [T2] 71 engine into 65

...Mounting is carried out by the D bolt through the starter
two studs on the bottom of the engine case and the mean and nasty
upper left engine bolt...

Some time back, someone on this site suggested J-B welding a nut to the back
side of the engine flange to receive that &quot;mean and nasty' bolt.

Last week when I had the engine out of my '63 SC, I did exactly that. It
worked like a charm.

It's still hard to reach the bolt, but at least I didn't have to reach in to
hold the nut.

Incidentally, I'm sure many of the people on this site will know exactly which
years and models had this, but the engine I pulled out of my KG originally,
had that nut pressed into a boss on the flange.
