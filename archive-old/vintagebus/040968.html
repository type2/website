Hi,

I am new to this list and new the the vintage bus scene, although I have a
66 Beetle, 70 Cabrio &amp; a 99 New Beetle already.  Last week I purchased a
1955 Single Cab pickup at the MOFOCO show in Union Grove, WI and drove it
home to Chicago.  It runs great and I plan to use it as a work truck for
awhile (I buy, rehab and resell properties) and fully restore it in a year
or two.  The owner said that it has an early 60s 40hp engine and I must say
it is one of the smoothest running VWs I have owned.  I had problems getting
it into reverse at first and the seller told me that it needed a shift
bushing &quot;same as in my beetle but easier to get at&quot;.  Now I lost 4th gear.
:-(  So I am going to change the bushing and hope it is not the trans.

Since I dont have any bus manuals yet, is this an easy task and should it
solve my problem?  When I shift to 4th there is no noise (feels like
neutral) so I am being optimistic here.

Also, how rare is a 55 pickup and what is the range of prices, before and
after restoration?  Even in its current state it still turns heads here in
Chicago.

Thanks.
