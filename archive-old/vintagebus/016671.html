Hey all,

I was wondering if someone could give me the normal and maximum shifting 
speeds/ranges that people follow running bignut trannys and freewayfliers.  
I've got a 66 bignut and don't have much to compare to.  I have been 
following the muir 15 25 40 marks as redlines.  Same deal with the tics on 
the speedo.  A friend with a bus says he'll wind 3rd up to 48mph or so no 
problem.  Would like to figure out if I possibly have a freeway flyer.


Thanks,

Eric
