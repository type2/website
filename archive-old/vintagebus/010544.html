Subject: VIN decyphering

I have been using busted bus to find out as much as I can about my 66
Westfalia!  Some info I have found some I have not.  Thanks for everyones
time, I know this _at_#$#_at_  gets repetitive!
The identification plate says:
27 5
430 B42 C98 080 108
UT 2312 523907 6160780

VIN: 236160780

What I got out of this is:
Born May 27, 1965 or 66
US Dual circuit brakes
camper w/poptop, tent &amp; roof rack (I want a roof rack and tent) can I
pretend my 70 tent is legit, close but it has a floor (just kidding I know
how lucky I am to have my 70's tent!)
left hand walkthrough
108- has camper interior
USA port ???
Color?
Color?
Color?
I was expecting 4242?? because it sure looks like it was originally lotus
white all around!  
Last is Chassis #6160780

Thanks all,

Patrick Flynn
66 Westfalia  (looking for an original front bumper!!!)
75 Campmobile Deluxe
