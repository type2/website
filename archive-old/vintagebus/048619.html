&gt;Ive traveled a
&gt;quite a bit in TX, LA, AR, OK, NO BUSES:( Dont get me wrong, theres a
&gt;&quot;few&quot; but not like the bus population you coastal people have. Of
&gt;course we know why there arent many left in KS, right Rick?&lt;lol&gt;

I'm kinda proud of that fact!!  I've worked hard to corner the market on
busses in this part of the world.

I think it might have something to do with the type of economy we had, the
distance there was to travel between cities and the size of population.  In
a big city, it would make sense to own a bus if you had to carry kids and
the like around, but on a farm, you just don't want to put all that stuff
inside that you can carry on a truck.  And with the low power, they just
can't pull too many hay wagons and farm equipment around.

I know when I was working out in home-stead country (Emporia Kansas) at a
VW dealership in the early '70s, we didn't sell many busses to farmers and
very few to small town people.  When the dealership closed, no body would
work on VW's.  Red neck mentality, they wouldn't work on anything that
didn't say &quot;Made in the USA&quot; on it.

I think the people on the coasts are just a bit more open minded to new
ideas and VW's were a very new idea in the '60s and '70s.  Dang old timers
around here still give heck about my &quot;VW farm&quot;.
