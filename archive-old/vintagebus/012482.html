I seem to be able to get everything except the thermostatic flaps.
Now, some say leaving them out is a small sin similar to removing the
thermostat from a water cooled motor and that the only thing to
concern myself with is the slightly longer warmup period. I dont know.
Can I have some advice please?
&gt;
I don't know the answer but I just put all the warm-up stuff on my
engine this weekend so, of course, I took a look this morning when I
got to work to triple-check that everything opened correctly, etc..  I
was surprised to notice that the thermostat didn't even open all the
way.  This was after a 10-mile highway drive then 1 mile on city
streets at 50 mph with outside temperatures of 65 degrees F.  So the
engine was still warming up.

I could swear I can feel more power from the the engine now,  too.  Of
course, with only 36hp, I thought I had more power when I added
padding to my front seat.  :p

If you are talking about removing the thermostat on a water-cooled VW
engine, you are reducing the life of your engine.
