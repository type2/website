&gt;&gt;  I agree.  VW would have to do some major tire licking before I would
show up.  Why should we help out VWoA with a show when they won't even allow
us to have their damn letters?  &lt;&lt;
----------------------------------------------------------

Since when are they &quot;their&quot; letters?

Last time I looked &quot;V&quot; and &quot;W&quot; were two of the letters of the alphabet,
which predates &quot;Volkswagen&quot; by many centuries.

The word &quot;volkswagen&quot; isn't even a &quot;real&quot; name  -  it's just another German
term/phrase made up of a combination of individual words that by themselves
have existed for centuries.  It's in the same category as &quot;einspritzmotor&quot;,
a German term for &quot;fuel injected engine&quot;.

FWIW.....
