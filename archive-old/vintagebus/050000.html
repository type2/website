Subject: re:temp. shelters


&gt;	Just wanted to add my vast knowledge of temp. shelters to the fray.  We
&gt;bought a shelter from Sam's Club a year ago for $200. It had a metal frame
&gt;and silver tarp with elastic strap thingies to hold the tarp on.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Herein we will advocate the welding of galvanized metal pipe. In order to
weld this stuff you have to burn the zinc off of it or else the welds will
flake off. If you breathe the smoke from the burning zinc IT WILL MAKE YOU
VERY SICK OR KILL YOU so don't breathe it, jah?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

We've had to deal with this in making a huge collapsible awning beneath
which Erin sells tie-dyes, safe from the sun. 8) If you have access to a
welder you can save a lot here (this might come in cheaper than the PVC too
considering the very long runs you can make with the metal pipe). All this
stuff comes from Home Depot:

--top rail for chain link fence. This is over with the lumber fencing. It
is thin-walled galvanized pipe, I think it comes in 10 foot lengths.

--1.5&quot; electrical conduit. In the electrical department. Note that the top
rail will slide nicely into the conduit like a hand in a glove. Nobody in
the Home Depot store knows about this phenomenon because they are two
different departments.

--tubing bender for the big conduit. You need to make &quot;joints&quot; for the
corners which the long top rail spans will slide into. The smart way is to
use the bender to take care of the angles in dimensions 1 and 2, then weld
on a piece 6 to 8&quot; long for the third dimension. Otherwise you have to try
to cut the tubing at the correct angle with a chop saw and weld it up, what
a pain (ask me how I know). You'll deal with three dimensions at the
corners of, and the peaks of, the roof.

--tarpage, nice big grommet kit (tool department, back with the protractors
and such), and those circular bungees that are loops with a plastic knob
(they're with the tarps).

--nuts and bolts, one pair for each terminated end of each joint. Say you
have a &quot;T&quot; joint, you drill a hole near the end of each section in the T,
then you weld a nut over the hole, then you can put a bolt in there and
clamp on to the pipe inside. It makes no difference what size these are
although smaller is cheaper, if you have a ratcheting box wrench in your
tool box then make it match that because that wrench works nicely to put it
up/take it down.

Draw it out on paper, mainly know how much pipe you have to buy. I doubt
you could spend more than $80 on materials for a 20' long one but check me.

When you're drawing the roof you have to deal with angles. Any angles you
like, steeper pitches make for more pipe and tarp expense but better
ability to shed rain. It's easy, just remember your Euclid, the three
angles of a triangle MUST add up to 180 degrees; these are isosceles
triangles so determine one of the three angles and the other two are
inevitable.

Euclid can also tell you what lengths to cut the pipes, if somebody really
wants I'll dig him out and go through the proofs.

If you've done some camping you've seen how the Pace-Arrow 50' motorhome
crowd is afraid of rain. At the first sign of rain they scurry outside and
take their awnings down. (down!) This is because their poorly designed
awnings tend to pool water in their centers until they finally succumb to
the weight and collapse, dumping water all over the picnic table and the
Yahtzee game. So either get some pitch on that thing or leave an un-bungeed
trough in the middle so the water can run off. If you close off the sides
with tarps, make the sides separate from the roof so water can drain off
inside the structure (but off of the bus). If you intend to have the sides
and roof all made from one tarp you better have some serious pitch and keep
it taut.

If you're welding this with a MIG you have to heat this shit WAY up, cut
the wire speed back and make everything glow bright, go slow, you're
burning off the galvanizing and until you do nothing will stick. It would
be smarter to do this with a flame in two passes. There is a very good
reason why you have that big wire brush. Really, it is very irritating to
have to go back and do it all again and I have, so take it from Hoop, make
that metal glow bright.
