I didn't tape that one But I did tape a 1955 German Grand Prix at the
Nurburgring 500 mile motorcycle race and it had an awesome shot of a
Palm Green and Sand Green Barndoor standard with a sunroof plus ovals
splits and a vert and a back shot close up of another Barndoor. Watch
Legends of MotorSports you're bound to see a lot of buses.

I saw the one you were talking about it was a Dove Blue panel on a
transport truck.

&gt; Anyone catch the show on Speedvision last night about the 5 most important
&gt; cars of the century? It had some great footage of the VW plant showing a
&gt; bunch of ovals, convertibles and even some barndoors! Among the other cars
&gt; were the model T, Citroen DS and the Austin Mini. I just caught the end of
&gt; the VW section so if anyone out there taped it I would love to get a copy of
&gt; it. Peace.
