Listmembers,

I've got a little pint can of POR-15 that I have been using on misc. parts 
(bus content).  I followed the instructions on the label to put a plastic 
baggie between the can and the lid so that the lid doesn't get sealed onto 
the can.  i can't get the lid to stay sealed on the can now.  A coupla taps 
of the hammer, and it has gone on in the past, but it won't go on now.  Any 
suggestions on how to keep the lid on a can of paint when it doesn't want to 
stay?  Should I try to bend out the &quot;lip&quot; on the lid with pliers, or what?

Thanks!
