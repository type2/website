Greetings.

I hope I am posting this to the right place.  One of the local dealers has a
81 Westy bus for sale.  Its white, has 134,000 miles and he want $5995
Canadian for it.  Everything is there and it looks in pretty good condition.
No tears in the canvas and the seats have got seat covers on them and look
fairly well taken care of.  Its been well serviced, but will probably need a
new set of tires soon.  Its in Kelowna BC so if anyone wants any more info
let me know.

James
