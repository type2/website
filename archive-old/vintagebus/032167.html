Subject: What year is this?
Message-Id: &lt;4.1.19990317073508.009c4790_at_nala.qualcomm_dot_com&gt;

I am kicking myself right now for loosing all the M-codes and the vin
number I wrote on a piece of scratch paper yesterday.

I went to the back of this paint shop yesterday to inquire about this bus
that I have seen from the road on the way to work for the last year.  One
of the guys that works there owns the thing and had painted it himself but
never put it back together because he had recently started a family and
didn't have the time(he offered to sell it to me for this reason).  In all
this excitement I forgot to ask him what year it was  but that didn't
matter because I wrote down all the tag numbers and I could figure it out
on Thom's and/or NEATO's web page when I got home.  As I said, I lost the
piece of paper, so here go's the question (it may be a wide range of years,
I'm not sure).

What years did the bus have the small round taillights, the latch to hold
open the rear cargo door instead of the spring,and full overhead vent up
front?  That is all of the details I can remember, other than it had nice
paint job and zero rust on the undercarriage (didn't ask how much body
filler was used for the repaint).

Any answers or guesses would be much appreciated,

Harry
