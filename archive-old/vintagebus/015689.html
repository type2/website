Calf. DMV will register YOM plates on vehicles from 1962 or older (25 
years).  This is subject to authentication of both the vehicle and the
plate.  YOM plates after '62 must be the plates that were orginally issued
with that vehicle.  Use DMV form REG 352 and a check for $35.

If it's worth doing, it's worth doing
yourself.

&gt; There is no magic to keeping black plates on a car that already has them;
&gt; you just can't put them back onto a vehicle that's been &quot;upgraded&quot; to
&gt; later plates. I'm sure they love to collect the old plates from people,
&gt; as it measn they can now sell that # to someone for a boutique plate.
&gt;
&gt; As an aside, I wonder how much of the $$$ for an &quot;environmental plate,&quot;
&gt; as they're called, actually goes to the environment.  You know, like
&gt; the California Lottery and schools.

&gt;&gt; I have black and gold plates on my 65 and have never had any hassle from
&gt;&gt; DMV.  I just pay the thing by mail, no face to face interaction, that's
&gt;&gt; the key.  BTW only $34 last year woohoo!!
