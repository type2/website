Subject: Re: [VB] Bus Puzzler - Need Help


[...] that sounds exactly like my bus - I'm gonna try this
 http://www.type2_dot_com/bartnik/relay.htm
as soon as I can locate the relay.

 jdd 60 std

&gt; Here's a puzzler that I'm living with right now:
&gt; 
&gt; '67 deluxe. runs great. starts up just perfectly when cold.
&gt; 
&gt; ride around for 15-30 minutes, and when I shut the ignition off, it 
&gt; will not restart. no noise, no starter, nothing.
&gt; 
&gt; battery is fine. lights work.
&gt; 
&gt; I let the bus sit for 30-45min., try it again, and it starts right up!
&gt; 
&gt; does this sound familiar to anyone? any suggestions? I have replaced 
&gt; the keyed ignition switch, but it doesn't prevent this from happening.
&gt; any help would be much appreciated!
&gt; TIA,
&gt; -DB
