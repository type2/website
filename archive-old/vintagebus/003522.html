How about a Busses By The Bay at either Sandy Point state park near
Annapolis, MD or Hemmingways in Stevensville on the other side of the Bay
Bridge?  I'd love to orgainze something like that for late September early
October.  Please p-mail me if you are interested and based on the response I
get over the next week or so, I'll let everyone know.  I need to start the
flyer distribution at the latest by the Atco, NJ event - I think that's
early July sometime - and will continue to do so until the last big event of
the season before the event is scheduled.
