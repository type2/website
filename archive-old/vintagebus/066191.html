Subject: Re: [VB] Disc Brakes on Front??

Anyone looking for some serious braking options check out www.germanlook_dot_com 
or www.oldspeed_dot_com and talk to Russell.

The front 944 brakes on my bus are incredible.  The stock bus brakes are 
good for one or two good pulls, but get on a mountain road and start heating 
them up and the 944 system will just keep grabbing again and again. No fade.

... Soon to be rear discs and IRS as well.

Note that none of these changes are for the faint of heart or wallet as the 
conversions done right are not cheap.

Later,
Adrian
