Subject: RE:  circlip pliers

Joe, Cal,  others,

Ditto here this weekend too.  Only I paid 7 bucks more . . . I made the
mistake of buying a set of Taiwanese crap &quot;Pittsburgh&quot; from Harbor Freight
before busting them clean (both pear)  trying to put in the big snap ring
that holds the paddle end of the axle in the side gear.   You live and
learn.  Ah Sears Craftsman tools!  Maybe not the BEST, but darn near it,
and easily replacable for free when they do break.

Curt
