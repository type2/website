&gt; I have a '63 single cab that is a white color.  It's whiter than my Pearl
&gt; White '65 camper.  The plate inside merely says WHITE.  When I entered this
&gt; into the vintagebus registry, it translated out to &quot;Lotus White.&quot;
&gt; paintscratch_dot_com
&gt; says there was L84 White, L87 Pearl White, L82 Silver White but no Lotus
&gt; White for that year.  Any thoughts as to the true color?
&gt;&gt; 
&gt; I think WHITE = Pearl White.
&gt; 
&gt; I've seen and owned original paint Pearl White vehicles that were different
&gt; production years and did not appear to be the same shade.  Some looked more
&gt; white, some looked more tan/pearl.

I'll second Everett on that.  My 63 DC's m-code says its pearl white, but
the og color is a lot whiter than other &quot;pearl white's I've seen.  Go
figure.
