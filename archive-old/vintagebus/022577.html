&gt;I recently (about a month ago) replaced the boots that go on the rear axle of

&gt;hlld them together. I don't remember which manual I read regarding their
&gt;installation, but it didn't mention anything about lubrication wiht the
boots.
&gt;How does this area get lubricated, is it from somewhere else? Did I screw up,
&gt;should i have put some lubrication grease in there?

Nope, no need to grease 'em like you would CV's - they get plenty of fluid
from the tranny, as you'll soon find out when they crack...
