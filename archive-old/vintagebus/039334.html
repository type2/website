&gt;Well volks, it's been a blast reading your rants and raves and such. I've
&gt;sold my bus. 'Twas a dark day, but it was time. I'll miss it and will miss
&gt;you all too.

&gt;Bus-less, first time since 1968
&gt;

I am going to reply to this even though hes gone. I too am soon going to 
leave this list.
My bus will soon be traded for a bug. Sorry to see it go but thats the way 
it is.
1963 1 ton option, freeway flier leaves me. The bus is  a bit more then I 
can deal with now (its mechanically sound, but leaks around all glass, bondo 
everywhere, ugly really) and out it goes. I really liked this bus though.

So what am I getting?
The straightest and most rust free 1960 bug I have seen in a while. It has 
been modified a little, mostly in the engine and tranny dept. Oh this ones a 
sleeper, but look out! A 1835 engine with a posi tranny, it was a 
competitive drag car. 13 second quarter mile passes. But outside its all 
original with glass brake lights, a real show car. Needs paint to return it 
to the original ceramic green, but thats alright by me.

I havnt had a bug since 1985 but I am happy to get a little comuter. I still 
love busses, and would like to get another, but this is just too good to 
pass up.
The new owner looked my bus over, and really knows what needs to be done and 
how to do it. I think we all can appreciate that this bus will no longer be 
headed to the grave with a slow silent rust death and will be reborn as the 
camper it could be in the right hands. Maybe thats the best thing after all.
