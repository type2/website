 Sigh, I know this has been beat to death, but know I find myself the victim
 of the wont start syndrome. '66 Sundial, when I bought it, it had a 8volt
 bat and a Ford relay for a hot start. 'Course I want it correct so new 6volt
 bat. ditch the Ford relay, new solenoid and rebuilt starter. Wont start,it
 does if I cross the solenoid, faint click as the key is released from the
 start position. Trying Eric &amp; Barbs tip, I've been cleaning the fuse box
 terminals. Still no go, any thoughts ?

There's nothing wrong with an 8v battery. You never can tell -- maybe the PO 
has put
some odd wiring in the circuit. I'd advise you to go back to the 8v system. 
It won't hurt your starter yet will make it turn over faster.
