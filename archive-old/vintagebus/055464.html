Wheel cylinders-
I've never heard of reasonably new German ones blowing out.  I have heard
several stories of Brazilian ones blowing within a year or so.  I don't
get around that much though.  I have been given the idea of buying
Brazilian and then installing German rebuild kits.  (Don't know if they are
still available) Seems like a way to save a little money.
As far as M/C I haven't heard of much troubles with either country.

I seem to remember getting a new ATE cylinder and it was made in UK.
OK by me as long as it's not Lucas.:)
