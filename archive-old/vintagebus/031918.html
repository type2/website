Subject: Re:  [VB] Parting out 64 sundial camper
To: Claralw_at_aol_dot_com, vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

Heres the headline so people who don't like to read long emails can get the 
reason for the 64 sundial getting hacked:
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;But the REAL REASON ITS GETTING BUTCHERED, I need parts to restore my 56 
westfalia and noone seems to be helping out without assigning ridiculous 
&quot;crack head&quot; prices for &quot;bread and butter&quot; items. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;


And the complete email:
I knew someone was gonna try and make me think about my consience (sp?). =)
O.K., Here goes it:
No wheel wells front or rear.
No engine.
Trans unknown, steering unknown.
No brakes.
Shotty tires.
Missing front overrider.
Hit *HARD* on drivers dogleg at bottom....fixable.
HONESTLY.......It could be restored.
It's better than some of the POS's I see still roaming the streets.
But the REAL REASON ITS GETTING BUTCHERED, I need a left rocker and some 
frame areas to restore my 56 westfalia and noone seems to be helping out 
without assigning ridiculous &quot;crack head&quot; prices for &quot;bread and butter&quot; items.
Anyone want to drop off a left rocker complete in good shape, the left rear 
outrigger, and two jackpoints, and 600$ cash and haul this menace away?
It's even got a pink slip, clear title.

&lt;&lt; sorry, but why are you parting it out?   even though it's not a 21 window 
or 
DD panel, still- is it that terminal- why not find a buyer for a bus, no 
motor, battery not included, some assemby required?
