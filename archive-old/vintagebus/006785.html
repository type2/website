1200 miles later I'm home, on my trip I only saw 3 splits, 1 on the road by
San Diego, 1 at the beach in Malibu ( a real surfer dude bus) and the other
I saw sitting in the back yard of one of those million dollar mansions in
Thosand Oaks , it was a 60 or 61 hatch top Westy, My friend is going to go
back and ask if it's for sale, said it's been setting there for the 2 1/2
years he's lived near there and it hasn't moved.
     Another observation I made was that the Vangon is the bus of choice for
the yuppie generation in the Thousand Oaks/Malibu, Cal. area, there seemed
to be one everywhere I looked, parked next to there Mercedes SUV, but I did
see at least 20 to 1 Vanagons to every other VW Bus I saw.

ronnie  &quot;1200 miles in the As#ro van&quot;, but still prefer my buses
