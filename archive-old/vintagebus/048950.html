I still can't believe I'm reading this.

I can't really say anything more than what others have expressed about Josh.  He was a honest, genuine human being.  He'll be missed.

&quot;My time coming, any day, don't worry about me, no.
  Been so long I felt this way, I'm in no hurry, no.
  Rainbow's end down that highway, where ocean breezes blow,
  My time coming, voices say they'll tell me where to go.
  Don't worry about me, nah nah nah, don't worry about me, no.
  And I'm in no hurry, nah nah nah, 'cause I know where to go.
  California, preachin' on the burning shore, California, I'll be
     be knockin' on the golden door,
  Like an angel, standing in a shaft of light, rising up to paradise,
     I know I'm gonna shine.&quot;
              Estimated Prophet      Barlow/Weir
