Hey guys, 
I am 15 years old and am hoping someone has some of these parts for a resonable price, so here it goes:
    I need all the seals and rubber for the front windows, ALL doors and door windows, and all side windows.
    I need a very back seat.
    I need seat upholstery for front two seats and very back seat.
    I need headliner.
    I need ALL of the door panels.

Thanks a lot!
