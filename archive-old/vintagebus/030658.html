&gt;Actually, we're almost there; 25hp P/C's will run you a cool $600, and
I've seen 36hp P/C's  in the $400+ range.  An NOS 25hp &quot;big hole&quot; fuel pump
would probably run you well over $100
&gt;
I've seen an NOS 8mm &quot;flat-top&quot; 25hp fuel pump for $175, which is, of course,
insane.  I temporarily choked on my own bile when I heard that.

I have an NOS early 36hp fuel pump that I tried to sell for $100 a couple
times.  Of course, it's in a VW box with an NOS fuel pump base and seals
and factory instructions.  It's a real cool display piece.  I wouldn't actually
use it.
