&gt; Hello Everyone!
&gt;
&gt;     Has Anybody heard anymore news on the Radio's that were be
reproduced. I
&gt; believe the gentlemen that were making them were making them for 6v
buses
&gt; and they were in the works on a 12v version as well. Has anyone
heard more
&gt; on the 12v version's and were they going to fit the 67 radio plate?

On low-current accessories like radios (&lt;2A or so) it's no trick to
use a 6V accessory on 12V.  All you do is hook up a simple voltage
regulator chip and it'll produce a reliable 6V for your radio.  The
voltage regulator can be either external or internal, if there is a
bit of space inside your radio.

Turning 6V into 12V is a bit tougher!
