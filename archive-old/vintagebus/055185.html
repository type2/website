Subject: RE: [VB] Highroof Camper

  That highroof has been sold and resides in Cali. somewhere now. The new
owner was at Jerome with it, he stopped by there on his way back from
picking it up. He is a friend of Dave Sweanhagens (spelling) who's in
Phoenix, Az. At least that who he was camped with.

List:

Does anyone know the owner/seller of the Dove Blue Highroof with the German
camper conversion?  It was for sale about a year ago, it was on Everett's
site for awhile in teh vehicles for sale area.  I think the seller was
Nick.?  He brought it to Solvang, then drove it back to Florida if my memory
serves me correctly.

If anyone has any contact info please pmail me.

TIA.

Robert
