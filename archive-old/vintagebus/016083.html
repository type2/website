&gt;I used to do a lot of link maintenance, but I don't anymore.  Why?
&gt;Because most pages people put up are transistory.  They get a
&gt;500 hour free AOL CD, throw up a page, and in 499 hours, it's gone, 
and
&gt;now I have a dead link.

I used to not put up any Geocities pages for that same reason.

&gt;One of my background projects is to implement a link maintenance
&gt;script of some sort, that could validate links on a regular basis,
&gt;and traverse and index valid links.

Why invent? Modify! There's tons of good link scripts out there that 
have validation built in. Take a peek at the system I have on 
http://www.sv2s_dot_com. I've modified the heck out of it, but the basic 
functionality is still there. It has validation, auto response emails 
plus the ability for users to modify their own links. It's worked out 
great so far. If you want to use the script I have, just get the link 
from the bottom of any page on there.

Happy weekend all! See you at Bob Baker if you're in the area (VW 
content :^) )

Scott

btw- Thom, as soon as you have something in place you'll discover 
that the link to Strictly Vintage Type II's is horribly out dated!
