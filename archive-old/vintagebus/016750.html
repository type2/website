It seems that the original vs unoriginal is more important for 
passenger models.  You don't take as large a hit on commericals.
It also depends on how far you stray; that metal-flake perl paint job
will be harder to unload than a basic solid color.  Try and
stay away from metalics - they don't look right with that
much surface area, and they get dowdy-looking *fast*.

If you do have the color changed, have it done *right* - do the jambs,
dash, engine compartment, etc.  It looks tacky if you don't.

Otherwise just paint it the original color.

&gt; Hello everyone. Quick question. I am greatly considering getting my bus 
&gt; painted. Right now it has the original paint on it which is in good 
&gt; condition. It is Pearl White/Green color scheme. I have always liked the 
&gt; Chestnut Brown/Sealing wax red colors and I am considering these for the new 
&gt; paint job. How will this affect the value of the bus in the end? I do plan on 
&gt; keeping it but you never know what could happen. So, original or unoriginal?
