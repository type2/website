Subject: Re: [VB] Carb woes / flat spot and over heating continued

Sounds like the low and mid range curcuit in your carb has restrictions.
Not always will a simple carb rebuilding take out restrictions.  In the
past, I have had to remove soft plugs on the carb where they drilled the
passages, clean the passages out then reinstall the plugs.

You might also check your timing, it may be a bit slow.


&gt;Symptom: dreadfully bad flat spot at low rpm. I thought was due to 009 but
&gt;as bad if not worse with vac advance dizzy. Rebuilt carb made it worse yet
&gt;and today at idle, parked, when I stomp the gas is the thing nearly dies. I
&gt;have to pump the petal to keep it running. Is fine at higher rpm. Ran great
&gt;in this 60 degree weather going down hill!  :-(
