Another way to lengthen your cable if it's long enough is to use an extra 
barrel clamp (might have to use a longer bolt) and a length from the end of 
another cable.  Tighten over both cables and &quot;voila&quot;.  However, if you're 
going to buy another cable for the ends, might just as well replace it!
