Subject: Re: [VB] E brake cables

Hi Richard,
If you can not find early E-brake cables you can have 1961-63 cut down and  
new front ends swedged on.  The only problem we had with doing this was the  
new ends were longer then the stock ones.  If we had figured this out we  would 
have cut them down in length first.  Instead when we tried to install  the 
modified 1964-67 cables in our 1960 walk thru panel camper conversion we had  to 
slightly bend the ends so they would pass through the curved sections of the  
body tubes.
