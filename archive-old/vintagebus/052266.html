Subject: Window seals, wiring

--=_B2EFBFB2.60016338

I was able to do the rear window alone. The roofing patch was thick, and a =
prop held the hatch in the up position. Had to flip it down a few times to =
push and used a spritz of WD-40 in the tight spots. I'll use a thicker =
cord next time, thin nylon cord digs fiercely into your hand. I brush the =
tar into all the sealing areas of the frame and on the edges of the glass =
before putting the seal on the window. Lubricant in the frame groove is a =
good idea. I slop enough in while handling the rubber and cord.=20

If you're going to put in a guage or tach go see your favorite computer/net=
work guy and get some stranded (not solid!) shielded twisted pair cabling. =
Most of the stuff laying around is 8 conductor, plenty for oil and cyl =
temps, tach, etc.  Use a terminal strip or a spare fuse block at both ends =
and wire from there to your guages and senders.=20
