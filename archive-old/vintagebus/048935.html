Stephen &amp; List:

I say do the rubber yourself.  I also say do it after the bus has been painted, but if that isn't going to happen in the near future, it might be your best option.  New rubber isn't cheap, and a lot of it can't be reused.

Most of the rubber is easy, but can be time consuming.  Aside from the windshields and rear window (which take two people) you can do it by yourself.

It's the prep that takes time.  Getting the pop-outs apart without breaking  the glass and stripping the screw heads is a task.  You'll also need to take the front window frames apart and pull the vent window.  Typically you won't need to replace the vent rubber, but you will want to replace the vent weatherstrip, which is the one piece rubber that fits into the window frame.  The only critical thing I found when replaceing the scrapper on the window frame is to make sure that the channel that the scrapper fits into is straight and not bent in.  You can stragihten it by taking a thin flathead screwdriver and pulling up the areas that have been depressed.  I don't think I've ever seen the top of a window frame that doesn't have a few small depressions in the scapper channel.  This will save you a lot of time and blisters by getting it straight ahead of time.  It's also critical to do BEFORE painting, otherwise you'll chip fresh paint off when straightening it later inorder to get the scapper to slide through.

I would guess that prep time and installation time for windshields, rear window, both window frames. door seals, cargo door seal, you're looking at 10 to 20 hours of work, all depending on how smoothly things come apart and go in.

If you are going to repaint the bus, I'd wear a warm coat and try and keep it out of real heavy rains in the meantime.  It's too expensive to do twice in one or two years.
