Subject: RE: [VB] frozen door handles

My cure all for door locks and push buttons is to heat them up thoroughly with
a hair dryer to get them good and dry and real warm. I push a tooth pick to
hold the &quot;key door&quot; open so that I know the warm air got into the tumbler
area. After good and warm and dry I liberally spray down with Silicone based
TV tuner cleaner, a Radio Shack product. The silicone gets into the pores of
the metal and stays there. I then use LPS lubricant, not WD-40 which
evaporates off, and spray the button and tumbler down again. No problem after
that. I first learned that with my moms new 67 square back. M dad did all the
locks and latches and then did the family 65 bus.

my door handles keep freezing(the little button becomes impossible to push).
I had used the lock de-icer stuff, sprayed wd-40 all over everything...any
other ideas? I was thinking that I might take the door panels off this
weekend and heat the mechanisms up with a heat gun to try to dry it out,
then spray a ton of wd-40 in there.

open to other suggestions...thanks

oh yeah-my seals are always seeming to stick, making it difficult to shut
and open the door. I have heard of using talcum powder(i assume just baby
powder will work fine) do i just put it on my hand, and wipe it on the
seals....

thanks again.
