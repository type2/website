Subject: Re: [VB] NON vw 1500 muffler

Is anyone familiar with a German muffler with a logo stamped into the
rearward side that looks something like an F underneath an L inside a
circle?  On the front-facing side it has 'Made in Western Germany'
stamped in it.  I have an NOS one in my parts stash.

&gt;   There are 4 different manufacturers of European mufflers out there (that I
&gt; have dealt with). 2 being  made in Germany and the other 2 in Denmark. I
&gt; have found that the Leitzritz (German) fits the best with the J and P
&gt; (Denmark) being second with the Dansk the most inconsistent of the 3 (people
&gt; will say the J and P and Dansk are the same, but they are not)and the Ernst,
&gt; the worst fit. I think the Ernst are made in Brazil and sold as German. As
&gt; far as import the southern country, the OEM Mexico fit excellent with the
&gt; OEM Brazil a close second, the aftermarket Mexico next and coming in a
&gt; distant last the aftermarket Brazil. The choice is yours.
