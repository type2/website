Hi Matt,
Sure looks to us like damage from having the wrong clutch arm the rear end of 
the clutch cable passes through!  You will have to remove the engine to 
really get a good view of the alignment.  Are you using the straight or 
curved arm?  Was the cut through the boden tube on which side of the tube?
