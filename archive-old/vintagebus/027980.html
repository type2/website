Dave,

Nice engineering,

but.....

You can go to Radio Shak and buy a $10 dc power adapter that plugs into the
cigarette lighter and has adjustable voltage from 3vdc to 12vdc. If the radio
doesn't have a dc imput then cut off the ends of the adapter wire that would
plug into the radio and attach an alligator clip to each wire. Test to make
sure which is positive and which is negative and clip the wires to the inside
of the battery compartment where the batteries would connect. Plug into
cigarette lighter. Turn on radio.

&gt; I found a D cell in the trash because I couldn't see buying one just to
&gt; measure.  They are 2 3/8 long and 1 1/4 in diameter.  I went to the local
&gt; hardway store and browsed for a bit, finally leaving with (3) 'leftover'
&gt; pieces of 1&quot; schedule 40 PVC _at_ $0.50 each, and (2) 3/4&quot; copper pipe caps _at_
&gt; $0.49 each.

&gt; I'd post pictures but the digicam needs batteries..... ;-)
