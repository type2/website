&lt;&lt; I'm interested in the front mount.  And need to do it without pulling the 
engine out.&gt;&gt;
Hi Chris,
It really is best if you could remove the engine to lessen the extra wieght 
you otherwise are going to have to fight against.  

&lt;&lt;Someone told me to put the car on jack stands and put a rolling floor jack 
under the engine/transmission.  Why the jack stands?&gt;&gt;
If you do not take the wieght off the rear wheels, when you pull/pry the 
tranny backwards you will be fighting to twist and slightly shift forward the 
rear tires against the pavement.
 
&lt;&lt;How long will this take to do?&gt;&gt;
It depends on quite a few factors of how many parts you remove and loosen 
will make a differance in how easy it is to move the tranny backwards.  We 
have done the replacement of the forward tranny mount in a 1960 bug with only 
removing the rear engine tin and .  Result was extremely hard prying and 
looking back, very dangerous.  If you can remove the engine, rear apron, rear 
bumper, engine, and disconnect the clutch cable, rear tranny mounts, block 
front wheels, release E-brake, put the rear on jack stands, remove/install 
the front tranny mount and replace everything back you should be able to do 
all this safely in about four or five hours.  Eric&amp;Barb
