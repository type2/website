Subject: RE: [VB] Roof Racks

&gt;Volks Cafe in Santa Cruz, CA (831.426.1244)has the Wood slat roof racks
(made in China) at a real good price.

I am not saying this is a good or bad product...  But &quot;made in China&quot; does
not get my $ vote.  Remember they are still a communist country.  Or have we
all forgotten about Tienamin Square and the recent plane events.  Also I
have not seen China helping NATO in this time of need, maybe they are on the
other side?

I think it is worth a few more bucks to get a &quot;made in the USA&quot; label on my
products...  Or at least not in China!  And sometimes you, as a buyer, have
no option but to get &quot;made in China&quot; which is sad.
