&gt;After spending 10 minutes in a guilt ridden state of mind, I quickly
decided the thought of a conversion wasn't the greatest of ideas, and
probably not too affordable either.  Afterall, a 1959 15 Window Deluxe is
pretty cool in and of itself.  I'm content, I feel better.  My kids college
fund stays intact.


Hey Robert,
Don't worry, I'm sure that college fund will find it's way into that bus
just keeping it running as a 15 window.  And once you talk about making it a
21 window then you think about well why not a 33 window.  Why not make it a
42 window bus.  Yeah, you'll need transmissions, engines, reduction boxes,
new expensive rubber for 15 windows, plenty of things before you need to
worry about EXTRA windows to leak.:)
Has anybody ever seen a VW canvas sunroof of any kind that doesn't leak in
heavy rain?

John
58 panel, and haven't got around to all the leaks just yet.
