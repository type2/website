&lt;&lt; The heat riser tubes coming from the exhaust are there to counteract

 sure the heat riser tubes aren't clogged...  &gt;&gt;
Hi Volks,
This tube that is cast into the stock intake manifold do well to heat up the 
lower section of the manifold.  For keeping the vertical section of the 
manifold just below the carb from icing up in temps below 70F and especially 
in high humidity one must have the Intake Air Preheating Paper Tube hooked to 
the air cleaner.  Used from about 1961 on up the air cleaner has a counter 
balanced valve flap in it's intake snout that closes off the outside air at 
idle RPM to allow the hot air from one of the stale air heaters or off on of 
the rear cylinders in later fresh air heated engine to warm the carb and 
upper manifold free of ice.  Then when one accelerates away from idle the 
valve opens to let in outside cold air and shut off the flow of hot air ftom 
the Intake Air Preheating Tube.   Eric&amp;Barb
