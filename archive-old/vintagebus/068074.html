&gt;winshield seals in it along with a lot more goodies  A couple more items on
&gt;the way are early style mirror arms for the round mirrors, these are EXACT
&gt;cpies of original 58 and later (not wide base). Another item in the works
&gt;are 58 to 61 Aussie style tail light lens in orange and red!!
