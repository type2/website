My '59's pads are in great shape as well.  To test them, I cleaned out under
the seats real well, replaced the seat and sat on it... (I tried to get the
wife out there to help move around with me on it... hey wait, this is the
type 2 list serve)

Anyway, my pads didn't shed any great amount so I'm keeping mine.  The PO re
did the seats sometime in the late 70's so I'll replace the vinyl with the
appropriate material which is?????  Anybody know where to source it?
