The paint code is the second number:
5=Special Color
23=Kombi Model
654=?

I keep the NEATO Old Bus Registry codes.  I have recorded 96 codes
and know what 74 of them mean.  Yours is one of the 22 still unknown. 


What I can tell you is that Eric Allred from Nevada registered his
bus on the VintageBus Registry and he has the same color on 
his 1966

His is a Kombi as well, perhaps a Dormobile, so it could be
a color set up for Dormobile conversions.  Just a guess.  We'd love
to know if you find out anything.  Is there a paint sticker under the
metal plate with the M-Codes on it?
