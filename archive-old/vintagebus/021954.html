Subject: Side Awning Do it yourself
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

Want to know how many of you have made your own side awning. I m interested 
in a decent looking awning that will go over my cargo doors. Lets forget 
about blue tarp! I want to hear material, design and quality that people 
actually &quot;show&quot;.
