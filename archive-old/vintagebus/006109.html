No, 74 went to 57 1/4''. 68 - 73 was 56 1/4'', and I have boatload of 56
1/4'' 3 sided galvanized bars. The change over from round to 3 sided, as far
as I can deduct, was about the middle of 69. VERY tough to find 57 1/4''
74/75 bars, 2 years only. But the 76 to 79 collapsibles are even harder to
find....


&gt; i believe they went to the square galvanized poles in 1974

&gt;  68 - early 69 were round and black. They were 56 1/4'' long.
&gt;  They bent very easily.
&gt;  Sometime in early 69 the bars changed to 3 sided galvanized. They were
&gt;  stronger. From 68 to 73 all were 56 1/4'' long. They stored up on top of
the
&gt;  pass. side cabinet. Yes they hung over the edge, but VW stapled a grey
vinyl
&gt;  pouch to the top of the cab for the ends to stay on.

&gt;  I had a 73 westy, which had its childs cot (and rear hatch bug screen and
&gt; westy owners manual etc) and it was kept above the closet, and did not
hang
&gt; over the edge.  There was a little vinyl strap with snap I'd clip around
it ,
&gt; the strap was screwed to the top of the closet cabinet there.
&gt;
&gt; never saw a grey pouch thing.
