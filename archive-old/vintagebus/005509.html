    I feel his pain... having hacked a shift rod before. Hindsight's got
20/20 vision on that one. If you haven't done it, don't.
    anyways... there is a little doodad available for just this kind of
thing.
    Sold by the usual people... called a &quot;shift rod adjuster&quot;.
    Several pieces, it is.
    One welds up to the shift rod, the other screws into it and has the
dimple drilled in it to accept the set screw from the shift coupler... there
are also some lock nuts to keep the adjustment still.
    You can adjust the length of the rod as well as the effective angle
setting... handy to be able to do that, but it would be good for a few
points off if the show judges ever saw it ;)

&gt;&lt;&lt; Is it possible to take the nosecone from my 66 bus and drill and tap it
&gt;for a reverse light switch? &gt;&gt;
&gt;Hi NQ,
&gt;Sure, if you weld the area thicker, mill the top of the weld flat, and then
&gt;drill, tap.  To bad you did not cut the front shift rod with a hacksaw
blade,
&gt;after scribe marking it for twist.  Then using the hacksaw blade as a
measure
&gt;of how much material was removed, and the scribe marks to align the two
ends
&gt;you could have easily welded it back together.  Eric&amp;Barb
