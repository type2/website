Need some side mirrors to get legal, and these are what my bus came with. I
have access to a rusted set, but would like a nicer set if avail, if any one
has a pair that they want to sell. These are the style that mount above the
vent and on the door, not the long arm towing mirrors that mount only to the
door.
