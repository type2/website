Subject: VW graveyard/Pomona/600 miles

On my way to Pomona I stopped by the VW graveyard I was told about to see
what was there, it was a shame, ovals, converts and bugs all made to Baja
bugs and other unknown types of somewhat off road vehicles, it's seems that
the owners son decided to make all the VW's to off road monsters, looked
around  couldn't find a salvageable part off the bugs, 2 Ghias one being
made to a slant nose and the other totally stripped with part of the L front
fender gone. The early bus (barndoor) mysteriously disappeared Sat. morning
as did any other salvageable VW that was on my list. The only split left was
a beautiful all original 66/67 double cab without an engine, it was still
there because they probably couldn't get it out. You see, the deal was these
people rented the property and hadn't paid rent for a while, so the property
owner took possession of these vehicles to sell to get his rent, didn't want
to throw the people out then have to dispose of all the junk there, exp.
10X20 fenced cube where 20 yrs of trash has been thrown and piles of hacked
cars and parts. I tried to buy the DC but there was a title problem, who
knows that deal might still happen, I took photos and will try to post them
once I learn how to use the digital camera download stuff.

Pomona, dead, good parts, few and far between. did meet a couple of closet
listys though, the one's that read but don't post and it was good to hear
that their buses were almost on the road and thanked the list for the advice
that they have read!

600 plus miles r/t 100 plus temps 90 0/0 of the way, cruised 60-70 mph,
18-20 mpg, don't know if I was heating or not, but no lights came on, even
at idle.

ronnie, feeling good after a good nights sleep,  volks
