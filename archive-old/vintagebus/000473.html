&lt;&lt; the fuel line came out of the carb. i am talking about the lil brass 
looking line that your rubber line hoos up to.i pused it back into the carb 
and it seemed to pop back in.is this a common problem on a 34 pict 3 carb?and 
if so is there a way to stop it without changing the carb? &gt;&gt;
Hi Mike,
As a quick fix in an emergency (Or just if you have not had any problems yet 
and want to keep it that way!) you can just center punch around the hole that 
the pipe is seated in.  You only need four to six center marks to shrink the 
hole enough to make the pipe/hole a press fit again.  One step better though 
is to file a couple of marks into the pipe before reinstalling at a point 
that would be just inside the hole when reinserted.  Then center punch around 
it to not only press fir it but make the surrounding metal bit into those 
file marks you made.  Warning do not make any marks go full circle around the 
pipe or it will possibly cause a breaking point!  
  All of the above info is not only a good idea to do to your carb, but the 
fuel pump outlet and if you have the non-threaded inlet pipe to do the same 
there.
