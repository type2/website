Hello all,

I purchased one of these tents from Steve Lashley a few weeks ago.  I finally got a chance to go camping with it and took some pictures.  You can see the pictures at:

Haven't had a chance to get out since, but am planning a week-long trip in August up to Washington (one wedding, one new nephew), so I am sure it will get more use then.

I posted this to all three lists - I have a '65 and an '88, and the tent works with both (wife won't let me buy a loaf - yet - but I don't see any reason it wouldn't work either).  If you have any questions, my home email is kgpayne_at_aol_dot_com.

Greg
65 Camper Conversion
88 Westfalia
