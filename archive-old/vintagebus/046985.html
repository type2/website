387  195   -    387 ?N Am specs,  195 is a mystery.  as I posted earlier, I
don't think anyone knows what this means, and I would love someone to prove me
wrong.   Seems to be on 62 and 63 buses.  Could be  electrical.  Could be an
optional larger rear view mirror.  who knows.

US    sent to USA at  port &quot;S&quot;
  211    panel van cargo doors right, LHD
  red    - ruby red
1028858-  VIN

......
The wird thing is the bus is registered as a '63 and the serial number
doesn't seem to jive with what my records show.  Any input here?
 -- - - - -
the vin does seem to be correct for a bus made in mid November 62
  as  the last bus made in Oct 62 was  1 021 182
and the last bus made in Nov 62 was 1 036 923

as the 63 model year started part way through 62 rest assured that it is
normal for a november of 62 made bus to be registered as a 63 because it is a
63 model year bs.
