&lt;&lt; I'm not the best at describing things... but I ran into what was described
 as a &quot;rear view mirror for early type II&quot; that was round, 3 or 4 inches in
 diameter.
 
 A round rear-view mirror?  Any idea what this is, if it is accurately
 described (even for a type II?).  Any idea on value?

 My sister and her husbands 60 kombi came with a outside mirror mounted on the
inside of the bus. They drilled a hole and a thin rod was put threw this hole,
and a round mirror attached just like normal. Sucks for the hole, but the
mirror stayed real nice on the inside of the bus!
