Subject: Re: [VB] 6v bus &amp; 12 v gasheater

&gt;Hello again :-)
&gt;I have a 6 v bus and have just bought a gasheater with 12 v, how do I get
&gt;this you things to work together, when I don't want to convert the bus to 6
&gt;v ?


Back in the days when 6v VWs were common (here I go dating myself again),
there were often 'voltage converter/inverter's used to run aftermarket
stereos, fans, etc.  You used to be able to get them fromm Radio Shack, JC
Whitney, and large auto supply stores.  Does anyone know if they're still
available?  I'd like to use one (or two) to hook up a nice stereo in my bus
after I convert it back to 6v.
