Subject: Trip report

Hey y'all:
Good to read almost 120 e-mails after 4 days on the road, mostly all bus
content. 

 First, Merry Holidays to all of you.  May your lives be peaceful and
fulfilling.

As subjected, trip report.  Got home from work Thursday am after 24+
hours of saving people from themselves.  Wife and kids has everything
packed up as they promised.  I ran around looking for my notebook of
items gleaned from the list and other important sources.  Having found
it in the last place I looked (because I quit looking after I found it),
into the Tinkertoy we jumped and off we chuffled.

Having been up for over 28 hours, I asked the wife if she'd mind driving
once we could no longer see Miami in the mirrors.  We were heading west
on Alligator Alley (aptly named).  As she settled in and we chuffled
away from the pulloff spot, I closed my eyes.  Instead of sleeping (too
much coffee), I found myself listening to the tinkertoy chuffle.  All of
a sudden it began to miss and lose power.  No warning, an instantaneous
cutoff like someone had turned a switch.  She caught again and continued
on as if the switch got turned back on.

Switch.  Hmmmmm.  Been spending lots of time trying to get the burble
and splutter out of the carb by jetting, rejetting, and finally asking
for help from the list.  Couldn't be the ignition, had that Pertronics
in there since I installed this engine.  It never has really run right. 
10 MPG

Hmmmm.  Switch, pertronics since install, never ran right, carb
adjustment's not making any significant impact.

Christmas morning,  Can't sleep.  6:30.  Campground's nice and quiet
except for the clink of wrenches and rasp of ratchet.  In 25 minutes,
the dizzy's been out, pertronics yanked, points (always carried in case)
installed.  Dizzy reinstalled, timed just right a-la St. Muir.  BJ the
Dog and I go for an extended walk so I won't turn the key and wake up
the world.

8:45, time to head to Mom's for x-mas breakfast.  First x-mas with Mom
in 19 years.  2 taps on the gas.  Turn the key.  INSTANT start.  fast
idle.  no skips, misses, no indication of anything wrong anywhere. 
After a few minutes warmup, ease into gear, let slip the clutch.  No
chuffle!!!  SMOOTH.  POWER like never before!

I'm grinnin' like an ugly man in a whorehouse with a fistful of $100's.

After x-mas morning with Mom, off we go to Disney.  Effortless 65 mph,
oil temp 195 pressure a steady 42.  Made it to the campground in
Kissimmee on 1 tank of gas.

Gave myself the best present I could get as far as 'stuff' goes.  Like
Bob Hoover, I have all I need without the stuff.  I have a healthy and
loving family.  I have inner peace that some call serenity.  I have
friends all over the country.

But I've also got a good runnin' Bus ;-)

&quot;So nice of you to visit me in my loneliness&quot;  The Wicked Witch of the
West
