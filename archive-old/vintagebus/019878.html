i have a 30 ton press(usa) but it came without a jack,
so i stole the 6 ton jack(china?) from my pickup
truck(usa), and had no difficulty. it is just a press
fit. i built a jig to align the king pins during
reassmbly, and found that the larger diameter rear
torsion bars(bus?), cut in half(i had a spare laying
around) are the proper size to use as dowels to push
on. probably as important, as how big the press is,
would be the spread between the rails on the table.
the 12 ton will probably do what you will need.
