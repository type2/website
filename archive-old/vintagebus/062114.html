Subject: Elephant glass?

Hey everyone,

I picked up some VWOA original elephant ear side mirrors at a swapmeet this
weekend... Minus the glass.  The assemblies are great, even the rubber
edging, but no glass.

Is it easy to get repo glass for this or take it to a framing shop to have
custom glass cut?

Any ideas are greatly appreciated.

Worst case I guess I can take some el cheepo repos and get the glass out of
them to put in the original bodies.  Then again it is probably crazy of me
to think the repos are even the same dimensions :)

For essentially trading a $10 part for them I cannot complain. Imagine that,
an actual swap at a swapmeet!  LOL

Thanks,
Adrian S. Pillow
