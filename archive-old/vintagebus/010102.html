After losing 3 relatively new wheel cylinders in as many years I now carry a
handy little kit to seal off the brake line in situations like this.  It
fits any _female_ brake line connection.

To securely seal the fitting/connection you need a 3/16&quot; steel ball bearing
and an M 10X1 bolt.  The ball bearing seats nicely in the taper inside the
fitting, and by tightening the bolt on top of it a large amount of pressure
is applied to the ball bearing/internal taper interface.  No sealer or joint
tape [Teflon, etc.] is needed.
It will not leak.

In a pinch a larger ball bearing could be used, but that would only allow a
few threads on the bolt inside the fitting.  My experimentation showed that
a ball bearing smaller than 3/16&quot; _might_ be forced into the orifice in the
fitting, damaging the fitting.

FWIW.....

&gt;&gt;  After three or four hours said the hell with it and got a beer.  Put the
old hose and vise grips back on and enjoyed the rest of the weekend.

Drove home with it (even participated in the Parkway Carabus), lots of
following distance and compression braking.  &lt;&lt;
