I've had a set of Izzs in my 67 since the begining of summer.  After
installing them, I noticed (with the clamps locked) that from certain angles
in the lower corners, the frame doesn't touch the seal!  I suppose it could
have been my install, but I've heard of this problem before from others.  I
figure, no biggie, it's summer and they're way cool in the summertime.  Now
that it's raining they suck.  Leak while your standing still, even more when
your moving.  I'm contemplating putting the stationaries back in til spring.
One of the windows is showing little hints of rust where the safari frame
comes together after less than a year.  I thought powdercoated metal wasn't
supposed to rust??

 So... I have heard different stories re Safari Window quality and longevity
 from non-list members and now I want it from the *experts*, from those who
 care.  NOS would be nice but how about the aftermarket ones like Busboys?
 And the thread asking about Izzy?  Any opinions on who's are closest to
 original and have the best performance... as in going the distance?  Both
 front and rear ?  I am starting the planning on my 1963 15-Window
 restoration and although not original to this unit I like the idea alot.
