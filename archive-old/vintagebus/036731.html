&gt; FWIW i've been told that the MC attached to the body, not the beam so
&gt;  wether one used a 67 or 6? front beam, the MC and brake lines would be
&gt;  mounted as the shell requires, not the beam.

true, we just swapped the front beam in our 65 to a 67 beam (same thing, just 
the 65 was lowered and the 67 wasnt) and the MC wasnt affected at all.  It's 
attached to the body, not the beam.  the only place the brake lines encounter 
the front beam are where the metal lines screw into the drums/backing plates.
&gt;  
&gt;  on my 67/61 swap, to simplify pullign parts can i just swap everything
&gt;  from the arms out from teh 67 to 61, or are the front beams different ID's
&gt;  in the bore?

should be a straight swap.  We switched brakes (drums/shoes/brake cylinders 
etc) becasue the 67 beam had been sitting for a while and the brakes on the 
65 beam were brand new.  if the condition of the brakes on the 67 beam had 
been known to be good we would have kept em and saved ourselves some time.

remember that we went from 65 to 67, not 61 to 67, but from B&amp;E's suggestion 
to go with the bigger brakes on the earlier buses it shouldnt be difficult at 
all.
