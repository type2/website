Subject: Franklin Mint Bus

I got one a year ago Christmas. It is truly awesome. I even used it to
help me identify how some of my sheetmetal went into Frodo =8) It has so
many moving parts it is hard to believe. Sliding ragtop, all doors and
hatches open. Slider windows open. Steering wheel turns the front
wheels. I'm afraid to handle it to much. I'd hate to break something but
it was an inspiration to see what a completed bus could be when mine was
in parts scattered across Omaha in several garages. I just wish it was a
Westy instead of a Deluxe. My daughter talked my wife into buying it for
me for Christmas after seeing me drool over it at the Mall. Now my
daughter wants a real one and I have to explain that mine will not be
available for SEVERAL more years. I told here she can have Frodo when
they peel the keys out of my cold dead fingers. I'm not sure what the
funny smile was about but she is living in Athens Georgia so I feel safe
for now.

By the way I have a Quicktime VR of the campground at BBB V on the
website. I don't know if this is NQ's or Roberts' but it is kind of
cool. You will need to have the QTVR plugin installed to view it. You
can get the plugin for free at www.apple_dot_com. Follow the links to
Quicktime downloads. Can be a bit of a download on a slow connection but
in addition to my QTVR there are lots of sites that you can view. Like
most things on the web use at your own risk.
