&gt; There are some truly outstanding [and inexpensive] modern 
&gt; tents out there
&gt; that would be terrific for a camper tent.  What's lacking is a
&gt; connector/adapter to tie them into the side door opening on a 
&gt; Westy, etc.,
&gt; to provide weather protection and privacy as is the case with 
&gt; the standard
&gt; Westy tents.

I agree wholeheartedly. For anyone who wasn't trying to get a 100% repo but
rather a functional tent it would be hard to beat the modern stuff suitably
adapted.

I am a junk store trawler and have seen caravan side tents in good condition
going for substantially less than the cost of the zippers that one would
need to buy to make them.

A mate of mine used a side tent from a caravan and adapted it to fit his bay
window. The tent came with a couple of add ons and he used these to make up
the adapter bits. The tent cost him the equivalent of $30 in total.   

Later 

Michael
