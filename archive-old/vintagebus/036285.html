&lt;&lt; er- isn't that mixed up- the bus has a .82 4th and the bug has a .89 4th.&gt;&gt;
Hi Clara,
Whoops!  Correct you are.

&lt;&gt;
Bet our 3.875R&amp;P with .82 fourth tranny with 1641SP will do almost the same 
RPM and MPH as his bus in fourth.  It is just a matter of perception, some 
volks just do not like to have to shift out of fourth at all once they get 
there.  Since with our third gear the engine hits 3,000RPM _at_ 44MPH, our 
fourth gear becomes in a way a fifth gear.
   Thanks for the correction, Eric&amp;Barb
