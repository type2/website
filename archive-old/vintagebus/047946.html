Subject: Re:  [VB] Another Panel Bus Question
To: charles_at_thebugbox_dot_com, VintageBus_at_type2_dot_com


Did ALL panel vans have the upper vents in the body? Because mine doesn't

have these, and it doesn't look like they ever had them. What gives? I've

seen busses both earlier and later model busses (1964) than mine with the

vents. Is it because mine is a double door?


Thanks in advance

they didn't have them if they were walkthrus.
