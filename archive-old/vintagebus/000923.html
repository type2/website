jb,

I deleted your question about the air scoops, but the difference between
smoke blowing out of an open window and air coming into the engine
compartment is due to the fact that the cooling fan is sucking in air and
blowing it down and out through the heater boxes; also (but less
significantly) the engine is breathing air and blowing it out the exhaust.
This suction causes a nice flow of air in through the air scoops (or vents)
and out through the bottom of the engine.

I once had a '64 beetle that was missing the right rear floor panel for a
while (had to warn passengers to keep their feet up!) and air would not go
out the cracked window - it would come in the window and go out through the
floor.

By the way, if your keyboard estarts espeaking espanglish, you could
probably pick up a new one for only a couple of dollars more than you're
paying at the Salvation Army :-)
