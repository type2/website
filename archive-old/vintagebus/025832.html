Subject: New VW Club in Akron/Canton Ohio Area
Message-ID: &lt;37FF868F.30B7_at_earthlink_dot_net&gt;

Just wanted to let everyone know there is a new club (Air Heads VW
Club) forming here in NE Ohio.  We already have a lot of bus owners.  We
put out our first newsletter already and we are having our first
meeting/pinic on Oct 16th in Louisville, Ohio.  I hope some listees can
make it.  Since ther are no VW clubs in the area, we really hope to get
people organized for some wholesome VW brotherhood.  You can contact my
self at:
                        Aaron Badertscher, Newsletter Editor
                        125 Kirk Ave.
                        Orville, Ohio 44667-1818
                        (330) 683-3231
