Ok, my contribution to the speaker resto thread was the nail polish bit,
   but I never used it on a cheap $6 bus speaker... Anyone know how to
   restore a throwout bearing?

OK - I'm the instigator of the speaker bit so I thought it appropo that I give
a suggestion on the throwout bearing...

If the two nubs on the thing aren't worn too badly, just pop out the metal
dust shields, wash in solvent, pack with wheel bearing grease, and put the
shields back on.  Some might think that this is penny wise and pound foolish,
but the job is so easy that it is almost ashamed to throw out a good bearing. 
(The bearing can't be making grinding sounds when you start this... I don't
think you can add material to a bearing, you know..)  I do this everytime I
pull an engine.  Never had to replace a throwout bearing.  (Disagreement suit
on..)
