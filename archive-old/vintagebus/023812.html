Patrick, split campers `65-`67 with the SO-42 Walk thru interior (what you have)
indeed have a jump seat....though it is completely different then its bubble
window cousin's jump seat.

The split's jump seat has NO legs, it actually slides in between the ice box unit
and the rear facing small (behind the driver) seat.  It is held up via two small
wood runners, attached to each of these interior cabinet pieces.  It does usually
have the same yellowish vinyl upholstery on it that the bubbles do....but here in
ends its similarities.

In actuality, most everything in a `65-`67 SO-42 westy interior is NOT
interchangeable with its `68-`73 counterparts....so be careful that any parts you
pick up for you bus are actually split westy not bubble...Good Luck

&gt; a walk through, the only thing that appears to be missing is what the online
&gt; manual says is a jump seat, which I am assuming is the AKA four leggged
&gt; stool, because it has the passenger camper seat behind the drivers seat.
