Subject: Opinions Wanted: Seat Cover Material

Since this is a borderline weekday topic, I waited for friday on this one.

I was searching for something to cover up the big rip in the doublecab rear seat
and drafted an old wool blanket that I picked up in Mexico back in 1978.  Nice
patterns and surprisingly enough it looked &quot;just right&quot; to me.  It got me
thinking (dangerous) and I started searching.  The link below is the material
that I'm planning on using to cover my seats, both front and rear.

I know its a far stretch from original, but I was looking for something to give
my truck a little additional &quot;character&quot; or &quot;flavor&quot;.

Comments?
