&lt;&lt; I have a stupid door question--A friend of mine wants to sell an extra set
 of front doors from a splittie he is having restored.--This set of front
 doors are complete--handles--windows, etc. everything is there--Except, for
 some stupid reason, &quot;The Restorers&quot;? --Went and cut off, On Both front
 doors, the Top hinge. Ergo,both doors are missing their top hinge--No doubt
 this does decrease their value. Other then the missing top hinge--both door
 are fine. Do not want to make an issue about this as to the &quot;Why&quot;?--But it
 happened--If you have any ideas just e-mail me, and I can relay the info to
 the owner of the two &quot;Topless Hinge&quot; doors--
  &gt;&gt;

If the hinge is cut on the bus side of the pin, no proplem, take the old door 
off at the pin/mirror arm and install new door.

if it was cut off at the door side of the pin, welding is needed.  Doable, 
but PITA.
