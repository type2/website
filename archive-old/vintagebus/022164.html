Craig, 

The NEATO page is down for a week being re-done.  It should go back up 
next Friday...

&quot;NEATO Net... a webpage barely alive... We can rebuild it... Make it 
 faster... stronger...&quot;  ch-ch-ch-ch-ch (cheesy 6 million dollar man 
 sound effect)

I got the checks for printing the newsletter last Thursday, so the latest 
Old Bus Review will be in the mail next week.

P-mail me your address &amp; I will make sure you get your copy.

The rest of you should join NEATO if you are not already a member.

Editor, NEATO's Old Bus Review
