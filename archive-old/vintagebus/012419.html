&gt; some friends of mine (okay they are my parents age and I've known
them since I

had since
&gt; I can remember.  They rented it out to some people who wanted it to
film a
&gt; commercial and it came back with the suspension all messed up as
they had
&gt; driven it up and down curbs etc and generally abused it.  It cost
the entire
&gt; rental fee to fix it.  So if you do rent out your dear old bus, be
sure that
&gt; in addition to the rental fee they know how to drive it, open doors
(non bus
&gt; people have trouble with the cargo doors) etc. and agree not to
thrash it and
&gt; to pay for any repairs needed due to their (ab)use of the vehicle.

good point.  I've a friend who rents his Harleys to the movie people,
and he insists that they hire him as a &quot;vehicle maintainer&quot;.  so that
he can be around to make sure that his bikes aren't trashed.  This
also leads to some side money as a stunt driver when they need him to
drive one of them on camera.
