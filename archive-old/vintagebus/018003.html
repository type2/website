Hi all, 

I recently bought a unusual NOS metric torque wrench from someone on eBay. 
It is made by a company whose trade mark on the tool is the letters &quot;VLC&quot;
and was sold to VW dealerships through the Zelenda Metric Tool company, a
long time and still current provider of specialized tools to VW dealerships
and mechanics.  It can be seen being used by VW technician/mechanics in the
Split-Bus Factory Bentley Manual, generally on parts and fasteners that
seem to require presice, but very small amounts of torque.  You can see a
photo of this wrench in the &quot;Steering Gear&quot; section (V-9) on page 9.  There
it is shown being used to properly adjust the steering taper roller bearing
with a torque value of only 2 to 3 cmkg.  It can also be seen in the
Transmission section (H-7) on page 4a, bottom photo being used to check for
proper torque on the pinion assembly.  The shaft for sockets on this torque
wrench is 1/2 inch and it reads in torque values from 0 to 35 cmkg (not
mkg).  Can any of you machinists or engineer types out there point me to a
conversion chart that converts &quot;cmkg&quot; to &quot;ft. lbs&quot; and visa versa?  

It's obvious that this &quot;cmkg&quot; scale is used for smaller or lower levels of
torque than the ft. lbs. scale we are more used to.

Let's say that you didn't want to over torque some fastener on your Bus
that VW has placed a small or low torque value on.  For example, I seem to
recall that VW calls for a torque value of 5 or 6 ft. lbs. for the six &quot;cap
nuts&quot; that hold your oil strainer plate to the bottom of your engine.  If
you wanted to use this torque wrench to get it just right and not risk
stripping out those small, fine threaded studs, what value in the &quot;cmkg&quot;
scale would equal 5 to 6 ft. lbs.?  There's got to be a conversion chart in
print somewhere, or perhaps on the internet somewhere.  I just haven't
stumbled upon it yet, so can anyone help or point me to it.  I'm obviously
interested in putting this wrench to good use around my garage pretty soon.

Thanks for any assistance you can provide!
