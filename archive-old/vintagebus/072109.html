Subject: Re: [VB] undercoating ?

Hi Kevin,
Go with the high content zinc primer.  Must be at least 85% zinc content or 
you are wasting your $$$.  Without the zinc against the metal POR 15, and any 
other type paint will just cover spreading rust from any chips or scratches in 
the finish, and rubber, plastic undercoating do even worse becoming a 
greenhouse for the rust as water works in.  Paint and then a thin coating of roofing 
tar, and apply chainsaw oil to places like inside lower nose, doglegs, rockers, 
lower doors, etc... after throughly washing out and let dry.  The stuff Stan 
is talking about sounds interesting, but we do not know if it has the same 
rust repelant action as tar.
