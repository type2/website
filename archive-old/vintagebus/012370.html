Good point here.  I haven't seen this happen, but I wouldn't doubt
that it does.  I hope that this bus has a current registration, which
would make this a moot point.

Another poster stated that the trip permit was $10, which seems a
small sum to pay. (and darned profitable for California!)

California DMV offices, particularly in urban areas, can be a real
pain to deal with.  &quot;Take a number and wait for hours&quot; is a normal
operating procedure.  If you are a AAA member, you can do a lot of DMV
transactions at a AAA office, where they are a lot more likely to
speak a language you understand.  I believe that the CAA and AAA have
a reciprocal agreement so you might be able to use this service to get
a trip permit.  Check with them first, however!
