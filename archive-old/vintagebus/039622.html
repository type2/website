&gt;I've been informed that Bug Fest in Normal, IL has been canceled. It's not
&gt;what I wanted to hear. Another thing; any of the IL and WI Bussers have any
&gt;idea if VW junk yard that was in Addison, IL been moved to it's new
&gt;location? Anybody have any details on this??
&gt;
&gt;Thanks,
&gt;

Well i guess i cant tell you if Spencers Home of the Battered Bugs in 
Addison has relocated yet. But I can give you his # 1-630-627-7228. I have 
not been down there in some time. If anyone is looking for some project 
split window buses that are located in the IL let me know. I can most likely 
help you get one.
