It is my impression that the Walk-through panels do not &lt;in general&gt; have
the upper vents. Bench panels do have the vents due to the cab divider. My
panel conversion is &lt;obviously&gt; not a Kombi based body, is a walk-through,
and does not have upper vents. With VW I never say &quot;always&quot; of &quot;never&quot; when
it comes to how it was delivered from the factory. I can only speak in
general~ and specific to what is in my driveway.
