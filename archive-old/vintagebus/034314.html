Last night at 8:02 Central time, the 18th torsion spring on my 66 was gently
persuaded (ball peen) to enter the die cut in the center of my top axle tube
thus ending about six hours of ruined clothes, cursing, primal screams and
countless postings on this list.

Thanks to Clara, Kyle, Eric and Barb, Ronnie, Wade and all other listees who
helped me through this thing.

For the record:

You must strip everything down to the axle on both sides.

Clean out the tubes with a broomstick wrapped in an old towel to see the
light at the end of the tunnel.

Install them in order starting with the skinny bottom one. Putting a work
light on the other side will help you see what you're dealing with.

The top 2 springs may need help. You get so you can feel them trying to
enter the die cut. Help them with a few light taps with a hammer.

If any of your springs are twisted or broken BFI sells complete new spring
packs for $50 per axle. The whole pack probably slides in easy and may be
worth the investment. I'm was too cheap to buy them preferring to ruin $75
worth of Levis instead.
