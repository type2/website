Stephen, 

The issue is not an one of upgrade but that of servicablity or replacement
if servicing should fail. 

&gt;If you already have a DC '67, why would you want to upgrade?  A well tended
&gt;MC should last for some time.  I believe I have my original on my '67.
&gt;
&gt;Plus keeping it original...

Speaking of original.....You helped Ronnie get the pics of the Church Bus
up. Are you helping him with the pics of TMIs  fabric?. I am excited that
the Platnum Mesh is being repopped and Ronnie had said something about
getting pics up. The '67 has no fromt door panels and I would like to see
what how the fabric looks.

Thanks
Chris
