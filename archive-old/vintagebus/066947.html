Subject: Re: Sheared RB bolt - clues?

&gt;
&gt;I sheared a reduction box bolt last night :(. I'm looking for clues to
&gt;make my life easier during the repair.

Bolt removal techniques that I have actually gotten to work:

* Cut a slot in the stub with hacksaw or Dremel and back out with
  screwdriver.
* Heat.  My back lug bolts were stuck in the drums until I took a
  propane torch to them.
* Smack the bolt perpendicular to the threads (like driving a nail)
  with a hammer/drift to loosen things up.
* I have used an extractor once, very carefully, and it worked OK.
* I have had more success with taking a punch to the edge of the
  stub and driving the stub counterclockwise and out.  (This is
  similar to Muir's &quot;how to loosen a big nut with a chisel&quot;.) It
  may help to first try and drive the stub a little bit tighter
  before loosening.

Other advice: use the right bolt when replacing; I think the RGB
bolts are grade 10.9.  And smile - worst case you have to replace
the whole RGB which is still cheaper than replacing one bolt on the
Porsche.  :)
