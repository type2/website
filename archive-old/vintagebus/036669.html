While I was in a rush when I last did mine and tore one of the lips I didn't
use the string. I used silicone lubricant and one of those rubber covered
baby feeding teaspoons. Suppose that sounds a bit dodgy doesn't it?  

Tearing lips with silicone lubricant and rubberised teaspoons eh?
Really officer, all I was doing was fitting my windscreens. 

Later
