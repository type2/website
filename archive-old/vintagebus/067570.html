&gt; After replacing the engine  in my 65 bus and it was running great to BBB and
&gt; around town,  I heard a snap and lost all gears.  Pulled the engine again and
&gt; the clutch release bearing LEVER is broken on one side.

Quite replacable!

Procedure:

1. remove clutch cable wingnut
2. Remove snap ring from shaft at base of actuation lever.
3. Pry return spring off of lever as you slide lever to the left on shaft.
4. Remove lever, return spring, and other parts from shaft.
5. Remove set screw from housing forward of left bushing.
6. Carefully tap and slide the bushing out of its hole.  This bushing is
fragile, so be careful with it.
7. With the bushing out of the way, you can pull the clutch shaft slightly
to the left, disengage the right end, and then remove the entire shaft
from the vehicle.

Reassembly is in the proverbial reverse order.  Make sure that the hole in
the bushing matches the set screw before tightening the set screw.

I safety-wire the snap rings with thin stainless wire to made sure
that they stay in place.  I've had to pull an engine to fix an errant snap
ring and it wasn't fun.

I also safety-wire the clips that hold the throwout bearing in place.
Cheap insurance.

Dune buggy houses sell &quot;heavy duty&quot; throwout arms that are stronger than
stock.  These are a good idea.  Make sure that you get the one for a bus!
