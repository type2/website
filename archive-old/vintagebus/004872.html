BINZ &amp; Co. Coachworks in Lorch/Germany were founded by Michael Binz already
in 1936. Nowadays BINZ stands for first class innovative special purpose
automobiles - from rescue vehicles to stretched limousines. Companies like
Daimler-Chrysler, Volkswagen and others rely on the BINZ' know-how and
closely cooperate with this manufacturer in the South-West of Germany thus
serving as solid base for steady and continuous success of the BINZ
trademark.

BINZ engineers transform good automobiles into even better ones. By
stretching, enlarging and creating new designs or installing special purpose
gear, an ambulance vehicle comes to life or a mobile clinic for medical and
humanitarian operations. Or, by applying the very same care and experience,
they stretch limousines which are unparalleled the world over.
