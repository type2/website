Subject: Re: [VB] body panel removal

Cut the corner up to about 1mm fromt he seam, and then you can drill
the welds out frm that point, without all the extra metal in the way.
Or, if you're a good welder, just section the piece you need.  Not
having seen your project (although there's a vintagebus_dot_com gallery
section just for projects!) I can't advise further.

&gt; I am ready to take off a rear corner panel on the 1960, but I don't know 
&gt; how. Are these pieces spot welded and can be drilled out? I have never done 
&gt; this before so any suggestions are welcome.
