Subject: Roadcow update

   The new trans showed up and by now Britt should almost be done and on the
road. Now thats what I call a hard worker. If everything goes according to
plan Britt should be arriving in Havasu around 6 or 7 am. I was planning on
leaving at 6 am (to the classic) but if he is near I will wait for him.

go Britt (and the roadcow) go

ronnie

ps. again thanks to all that has helped him out
