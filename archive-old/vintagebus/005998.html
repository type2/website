HI all
Things have settled down a bit for me, so I thought I'd take a few minutes
to update
Here is a short version,,, the longer one with pictures will be at

Auburn Hills Mi  Vintage show was a great weekend for My Daughter Vicki and
I. We arrived in Pontiac late friday night, finding a warm campfire with a
great group of people mostly from Wisconsin!
Mostly members of the DBG, waiting up for more members! Vicki and I recieved
a warm welcome and very quickly, I had a dark beer handed to me, fitting
right into the circle of friends!  Thanks DBGer's!
All weekend was fun meeting internet Listee's and Carabusing with splitties
and bugs and a GTi, around the Auburn Hills area.
There was a tailgate party,  a banquet meal after, and more time at the
campfires!
I met up with Chris Huff of the Great Bus Tour fame, and chatted a bit about
her Long drive! All the way from Atlanta!
John Hartranft and Chris Huff did a splendid job of setting up and
decorating an information tent! They had  wonderful splittie bus logo name
tags for Listee's to wear!  What a great Idea!
I spoke a few words about the Great Bus Tour from the emmcee's microphone
and then I accepted respondsibility for the Hubcap from John Hartranft so
that I could take it back to CANADIAN soil!
After the show, A few people joined in a caraBUS to escort the Hubcap to
Canada!  I even talked a few into spending the night  on North side of the
border! Unfortunately they didn't have the time to make it all the way to my
house, but I am sure they had a great time!

As we travelled towards home, Vicki opened the travel box and started to
investigate, there is so many subtlties in there! She asked me to play the
&quot;travel tape&quot; of songs recorded to pass some time.  It could be just that,
until you open up the case to see what the song title and artists are,, and
see a picture of Chris S.,,,, hmm,, praying to the Gods,, or maybe so elated
that he finally accomplished some part of an engine change,, I am not sure
really! But It is hilarious!
Other things you have to look for are the picture of the  Dog driving a Bus,
a phone card provided for emergencies, a flashlight with possibly the same
thing in mind ,,a breakdown in the dark!  The box of all the VW parts that
never break! it is empty! ..and the great story of Charlie Ford and the
Mothership!
Somehow a Hotel Key has found it's way into the memorabilia! I hope that
person was done with it and didn't need back into their room!
There are so many real neat additions to the memorabilia! You can see it at

Ongoing Hubcap saga

Yesterday, June 3 2000 My family and myself attended Cambridge Volkswagen
Dealer Cruise with the hubcap. My Dad was also there with his 66 Rambler
Marlin.
Many people stopped by to chat about the camper and were really impressed by
the intent of the Great Bus Tour!
The Dealer had not anticipated the Bus crowd that showed up, but were
impressed enough with Our Westfalia and the Tour display that they gave us a
Trophy liberated from the Beetle class!  So we got first in The Bus class
and Second overall the cars at the show!  They gave first to a real nice
SHOW '67 Bug.  And 3rd to a GTi.
We are getting the times and places sorted to make the next handoff so the
tour can continue!
