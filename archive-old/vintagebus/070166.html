Subject: Alternators and Carbs

[...]
The carb for an alternator equipped motor and for a generator equipped 
motor are different.  Actually the carbs are the same, the lever that 
runs the accelerator pump is different.  I've run into this more than 
once. ;).  For a work-around, you can grind clearance in the alternator. 
You also might get lucky (as I did) and find a friendly VW dealer parts 
department that will supply you with the right lever.
