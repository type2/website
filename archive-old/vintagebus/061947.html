Subject: RE: [VB] How do they do it??

You're best answer to that question is to get a small scissor jack from the
wreckers and jack the spring plate down so that the drum sticks out from
under the wheel well more.  This should solve your problems and you won't
have to remove the drum everytime you take your wheels off.

&gt; Can't wait to get a flat and have to pull half my rear suspension to
&gt; change the tire. &lt;rolling eyes&gt; Anybody out there have any suggestions
&gt; on how to get around this? Please spare me the &quot;put it back to stock&quot;
