(Selling) All of your chit? Say it ain't so, Joe!
Once you get the $15k in your pocket from the
barndoor, hopefully you'll change your mind !!!

Ellis asks:
So is that an offer that I hear? So when do I expect
the check?

Selling my chit doesn't include Paula's '67 Westy and
the Puck. We intend to do alot more camping... I just
want to conform to the norm be a happy techno
robo-tron and go lease an SUV for too many dollars
each month with a fat balloon pmnt and no equity at
the end. ;-) Actually a different job within a few
miles from my house and a dependable bicycle would be
much prefered over my current job/commute from hell.
Not to worry, VanBondo hasn't totally lost it. Just in
dire need of a camp trip or go visit my busclub buddy
Earl at work. &lt;inside joke&gt;
