Subject: Re: Autozone locking gas cap

I went to our local Autozone and sure enough they list a nonvented
locking gas cap
for a '67 Transporter, $9.96 out the door.  It is a common Stant cap -
part no. BG763  11563  or 5763 in the Autozone catalog.  These Stant
caps should be available at Pep Boys or Kragen, too, but I haven't
checked them. Tried it on our '67 and it is too small.  The gas filler
opening on our bus is approx. 1 9/16&quot;, but the cap fits something
around 1 1/2&quot;.  Are '67s different than earlier years or maybe ours has
been changed?  Eveything appears original, including a missing seal in
the original gas cap.  They have other caps so I'm going to take my old
one down to Pep Boys and look for something else that fits.

As for venting of caps, my '70 Ford just has a dimple at the top of the
filler neck which I would not recommend doing because of sparks.  I have

seen other vented caps with a 1/16&quot; hole in the little plate that has
the seal
on it.  A small hole anywhere will do.  On the Autozone cap the rubber
seal is
such that there is no plate to screw thru. I think drilling a hole thru
the rubber at the top of the rubber ( if you take the cap apart you can
see what I mean - 2 screws, just watch how it comes apart, not
complicated) and inserting an appropriate size pop rivet (SS would be
best) with the shaft removed will provide a hole thru the rubber.  The
head of the rivet should keep it from dropping into the tank.
