&gt; &gt;The first is the fix-a-flat-in-a-bottle aerosol can, and it generally works 
&gt; &gt;great. It will get you from some awkward place to where you can remove the 
&gt; &gt;tyre to work on it.
&gt; 
&gt; If you think you might be taking the tire to a shop for fixing after
&gt; using this stuff, hang on to the empty can.  Some tire places won't
&gt; work on tires/wheels that contain an unknown type of fix-a-flat.  Some
&gt; older kinds used a flammable propellant that apparently caused much
&gt; excitement in the tire shops.  Recent fix-a-flat cans have a safer
&gt; propellant but unless you have the empty can they can't tell what
&gt; you put in the tire.

I've seen shops that charge extra to work with tires that have fix-a-flat
in them.  I don't blame them at all!  Another thing that fix-a-flat can do
is to cause patches to let go, a concern with tubed tires and with
tubeless tires that have been fixed properly with a patch inside the tire.
Seems that the fix-a-flat stuff attacks the adhesives of the
cold-vulcanizing patches commonly used these days.
