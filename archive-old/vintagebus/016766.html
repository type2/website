I had the *exact* same problem with the '60.  Luckily Tom who was 
helping me install the engine diagnosed it *immediately* and calmed
my fears.  After a couple minutes of running, the noise was gone.
The next time I had the engine out, I could see two small spots
near the starter and the throwout shaft (can you dig it?) where
it had rubbed.
