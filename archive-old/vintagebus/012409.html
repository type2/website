  Hello All. I have a question on a bus that we found here that no
local VW places can identify. Its a '62 or '63, non-walkthru(I really
dont know how to tell the difference between models) The interior has
been completely gutted except for front seat. The unique thing about
the bus is the &quot;pop top&quot; that it has on it.
Going to try to give a good description... imagine someone cutting the
top off of a bus 4 or 5 inches from the drip rail, all the way around.
Then a giant rectangle baking pan,upside down, 5 or 6 inches deep,
slapped on top. Then a rectangle hole cut in the baking pan, 4 or 5
inches from the outside of the pan. Lost ya yet? Heres the getter, in
this hole in the pan, running on the sides, is two flip up half moon
shaped things. Ya flip these up to make the sides of the pop
top.(these have small windows in em) Then for the &quot;ceiling&quot; is these
aluminum slates that are retractable &amp; pull back, connecting to the
sides to create this weird &quot;pop top&quot;:) On the pass side, in the back,
on the &quot;baking pan&quot; is thas rather large tag that reads
&quot;Travel Equipment Corp, New York, NY, USA&quot;. The intire structure is
made of aluminum.  
  The reason I need to find out about it is that it would really be
easy for me to aquire(I have some VW toys he wants real bad:) But need
to know more info, especially on the interior. 
  If you think this wouldnt be of interest to the list, please pmail
me if ya have any info.

Thanks
