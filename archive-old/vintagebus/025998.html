&gt; Does anyone know how to operate the

&gt; what looks like a tiny red light. I'm guessing this the heater control.

Larry,

It is imperative that you check the fuel lines on the Eberspacher BEFORE you
try and fire it up.  The braided lines cover a rubber hose that is almost
always cracked and will spray fuel all over the engine compartment.

Check the T2 web site library under heating.  Look for the pictures of the
early 6V Eberspacher I restored.  Ron Van Ness posted them for me.  The heater
is a Stationary 56 and was made in 1960.  Chances are that is the Eberspacher
you have.  There should be a bowden pull cable and a red indicator light in the
cab.  To activate it, you simply pull on the cable.  That opens a vane and
engages the on/off switch.  The heater should come to life.  Again, I strongly
urge you to bench test the heater out of the bus.  No sense burning down such a
cool Westfalia.

Contact me privately if you need more info on the heater.  I have some copies
of a installation tech bulletin that Ron gave me.  Congratulation on the new
bus!

Steve
