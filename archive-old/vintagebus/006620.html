when I tlked to the man about this it had something to do with torque and
stall, the reduction boxes helped create more torque which helps in climping
I guess. They do not run at a costant 4500 rpm that is just the max at what
they take the RGB too. He is sending me the blueprints and specs on this
along with all the VW part numbers they use in these airplanes. The original
plans stated &quot;go to your nearest VW Dealer and get the parts you need over
the counter.

&gt;   I just got an interesting phone call from a company that builds
airplanes
&gt; looking for RGB (big nut). It seems that for the last 30 plus years they
&gt; have been useing VW Big Nut RGB's in airplanes powered by Corvair engines.
&gt; The interesting part of this is that they turn these at 4500 RPM's at the
&gt; axle shaft, I'd like to figuare out what MPH that would work out to be.
All
&gt; this talk of handgernading RGB's by turning to many rpm just went out the
&gt; window. 

OK, figure a radius of 0.3m, which works out to a circumferance of 1.9m.
At 4500RPM, this would be 8500m/min or 8.5km/m or 510km/h.  for those
stuck in the English system, that is 315MPH.

Now, if the 4500RPM is the input speed, you'll have to divide by the
reduction box ratio to get the output speed.  4500 seems a bit fast for a
prop, unless you want to send the tips supersonic!
