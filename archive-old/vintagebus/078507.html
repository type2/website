Subject: Re: [VB] Rubberized Coatings - an Interior Rust Preventative?

&gt;All that tar on a bus in the Texas heat....don't think it would 
&gt;smell too good! Doesn't sound like that would work down here.

works just fine... and i even went nuts and had like 1/4&quot; thick in 
some places to kill noise. does stink for maybe one hot summer, then 
is done outgassing. stink was not that bad, either; no eye-watering 
or anything. just a tar smell.
smelled much better than houston!

does get a little softer in the heat, and i did have some problem 
with the rubber mat sticking to it on the rear deck and cargo floor, 
but nothing horrible.
