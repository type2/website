Oh now let's not forget what Thom has to say about himself in his &quot;about me&quot;
section on his page:

Most of my free time is spent restoring my bus or working on my computer.
I'm still single, and looking for a nice, down-to-earth girl who can put up
with my hobbies and eccentric humor. If she could surf and play volleyball,
that would be a major plus. I also like to play volleyball; I optimistically
rate myself a &quot;B&quot; player. Usually at least one night a week I can be found
at the Volleyball Cafe.

Now let's modify it a little bit:

Surely a new &quot;wife&quot; is just around the corner. :-) :-) :-)
