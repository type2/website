Subject: Re: [VB] Turn signal switch part 2

Wrong switch. I have a '63, and I may be wrong, but from my experience I can
tell you the turn signal switches are extremely rare and are not made in the
aftermarket.

The switch I have was sworn to be the  right switch. It fits nice and tight
around the column and looks perfect, but the give away is the bright
headlight ability. The '63 has the button on the floor. All I had to do was
re-arrange the wiring and everything works fine. Steve at Wolfgang helped me
make it work.

&gt; Well, I've got my switch rebuilt and looking nice...we'll see how well it
&gt; operates.  My next question is, how does it clamp to the steering column,
is
&gt; the a bushing of some kind that goes between the switch and the column?
&gt; When I screw both halves together around the steering column, it's too big
&gt; to stay up, it just flops down to the brace.  What gives?
