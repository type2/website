Congratulations John!  You will love the simplicity of the splittie over
those other VWs you have ;)

Ditto everything Bob and Clara, and here are some other additions.

I agree it is probably the rear main seal, but how big is a puddle?  If it
is not horrible just leave it alone because it seems all the VW motors cry a
little oil anyway.  I say leave it alone because it is a PITA to get the
gland nut off (usually goes to a local shop with a good air gun) and then
re-setting the end play if necessary.

Tranny Oil:  Always take the filler nuts off first and then drain the oil.
If you cannot refill it then you have a problem if already drained :)  Same
with the reduction gear boxes.  I would strongly suggest getting Swepco 201
80W-90 tranny fluid.  This stuff is liquid gold for trannies!  It is about
$35 for a gallon, but well worth it.  Remember to get the pump for the juice
also.  Swepco can be found at any good Porsche parts shop or you can order
through www.pelicanparts_dot_com, check it out at
http://www.swepcousa_dot_com/lubesite/products/h201.htm

Do all the normal maintenance...  Oil, valves, adjust brakes, fuel filter,
change brake fluid, etc...  Check lights, boots, brake lines, etc.

On the fuel line be sure to get the original cloth braided line or splurge
and get the SS braided line.  I drilled a whole in my rear apron and put a
pipe piece back there so the rubbing on the sharp tin ware would be
non-existent, Home Depot plumbing department should be able to offer many
solutions.  If you do nothing else, replace the fuel lines.
