In the correcting of the height of my 63 singlecab I have replaced the 135
15's on the front.
Does anybody want them, they are tiny and make your speedometer read at least
10% fast.

Chris Canterbury says there are sidewall cracks but I do not think they are
major, and the price is right.

If you have a singlecab treasure chest lock chrome cover thingy I would
appreciate one.
