&gt; Wow
&gt; Man am i sorry i said that!
&gt; I have recieved about 20 or 25 emails about the step i'm not trying to weasel
&gt; out but i only have one and to be fair I woulnd'nt know which person to send
&gt; it to.
&gt; I'm gonna hold on to it fo rnow till i can figure a fair way to do it.

The easiest way would be to do one of the following:
1. Put all 25 names on individual index cards, shuffle them up, drop them in a
hat and pull one.
2. Send all 25 an email, &quot;I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 1000, what is
it?&quot;
    closest one to the number gets the step.

just my 3 cents worth (and I'm not one of the 25)
