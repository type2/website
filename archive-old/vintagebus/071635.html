Subject: Re: [VB] screws, oil and misc.

There is no seal at the pulley, just the grooves on the pulley that 'sling'
the oil back into the case. The leak is most likley coming from the oil pump
cover.

Correct &quot;cheese head&quot; screws are avaliable new here:

----- Original Message ----- &gt; 1) there is a bunch of oil right below the
pulley where the oil pump cover is.
&gt; Could this be mearly a gasket issue or more like a main seal from the
pulley?
&gt; It does not look like the oil is coming from the pulley area (pulled the
&gt; pulley to get the sheet metal off)
&gt;
&gt; 2) Screws. I am missing a buch of the tin screws, Is there a source for
these?
&gt; Is this something I can get at Lowes or something?
