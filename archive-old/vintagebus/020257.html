If the combined unit is unusual in the States, there's a chance that it was the 
one installed in VW Campmobiles in Australia (not std Westy Poptop, BTW). If 
so, it could be the same as mine, I have a 3 way fridge (12v/240v/propane), 
plus the two burner gas stove in mine. 

NB: Does the van look anything like this

&gt; &gt; hey, i know some of you have late model campers.  i found a 74 or 75 westy
&gt; &gt; with a really cool propane refrigerator/stove combo.  it's the size of an
&gt; &gt; earlier icebox unit and goes in the same location(right inside the sliding
&gt; 
&gt; Unless has been modified, the fridge is 12v electric.  these buses have a
&gt; 110&gt;12 converter in the vicinity of the rear/side seat that would run this
&gt; on shore power.
&gt; 
&gt; The stove is propane.
