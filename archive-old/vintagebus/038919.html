I just got a tranny done, it's on the way back from CA now. Shipping a whole
unit redux to redux is 240 lbs with a pallet at about 150.00 bucks.
The parts, with a new case was 780.00, and 380.00 in labor. I got alot of
extras, like a new pinion bearing, which I was told by many rebuilders that
that is not regular rebuild practice, welded 3 and 4, 4.12 r and p, new case
(mine was too corroded, long live NE winters), all new syncs, bearing all
around, reduxes redone, one piece boots, completely assembled, and they even
redid my brakes to protect the stubs on the way back, saving a junkyard set
of drums. This was done by transaxle engineering. I will post a report when
the axle is back and in, approx a month from now with the undercarriage
stuff I am up to.
I would also strongly consider Rancho, especially through Ronnie, as his
prices seem great. I must admit I could have got a unit outright from
him/Rancho for a better price, depending on where you are and how bad off
your unit is, that might be your best bet, saving shipping.

Hi all,
Looks as if I'm in need of purchasing a rebuilt tranny for my 67 splitty.
Any suggestions as to where to find the best quality / price?
Thanks,
John
