&lt;&lt; seems to me your knee would hit the driver's side gauges &gt;&gt;
Hi Everett,
We have ours in the same place on the other side of the speedo/steering 
column so both the driver and passenger (Which has saved at least two of our 
engines!) can see them.  Also we bolted/mounted the gauges only on the side 
nearest the speedo so if hit they easily fold/pivot away.   Eric&amp;Barb
