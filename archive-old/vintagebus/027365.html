Subject: typeIV cooler

If you look at the coolers side by side it should be pretty clear which
will cool better. The type IV has extra rows of cooling with very
similar spacing. In this case more surface area should fairly simply
dissipate more heat. As for hacking up all that tin to put in the type
IV cooler, it is really not that involved. The other thing to remember
is when was the last time you wore out your tin? Once you build this set
up it will last for as long as you want. Simply replace the coolers when
you do the engine. I agree with E&amp;B as I can't see a difference between
the type three cooler and type one other than that pressure sender.
You talk to your &quot;reliable source&quot; and find out exactly what difference
he knows about. It would be interesting to know.
Hope this is helpful,
