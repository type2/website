&lt;&lt; Stop by &amp; say hi if you get a chance.  I'm camping at Hanna park Friday 
and Saturday nights if anyone wants to get together. &gt;&gt;

I should be there with the Binz and some kind of camping trailer.  Probably 
won't show up till Saturday.  Can you give me a phone number to the 
campground and your site number?
