Subject: Re: [VB] Unacceptable

First and foremost let me say that in no way am I
defending the Mechanic.

however If I understand correctly you paid $600 for a
&quot;rebuild&quot; that ended up being just a band-aid.

Well $600 will get you just that, a band-aid, However
your mechanic should have made that very clear , that
$600 would get you only that.

Working on other peoples VWs is a pain in the butt. I
tell every one that inquires about buying one to be
prepared to spend lots of $$ of to do all the work
theirselves.
 Running a repair buisness is exspensive, and a
mechanic has to make a living too , just ask anyone on
this list who is a mechanic for a living.

If you truly belive that you were taken advantage of
or that the work done was not what you agreed to then
by all means make your complaints. Unfortunately I
doubt that it help in your case. I would suggest you
buys tools a Bently and start wrench'n your self.

Good Luck,
Bryan
