drive it to the docks with a stamp and shipping address painted on the top,
silicon the doors and places where water can get in, find a ship bound for
england, tie a rope to it and have it towed over, any questions, tell him it
sailed.

ronnie,az

ps, I'm delivering a bus to the docks friday bound for england, it cost
$975.00 to ship. That's cheaper then shipping a non runner cross country.

we sold a 21 window bus in original cond. at the beggining of 
october to  a guy in the u.k. he sent the payment but has yet to 
make shipping arrangements,I don't know what he expets to happen 
but I made it clear that the bus needed to be picked up within 30 
days after the sale.I also informed him that he will need to pay 
storage per day after that..but still nothing and he now owes over 
$500 in storage...what should I do next???-cameron
