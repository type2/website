 &gt; your reality it means the failure of Western civilization. Of course, how
 &gt; silly of me not to have seen it at once. I was reading through all of the
 &gt; pithy economic treatise on your site and I of course felt ridiculous for
 &gt; having thought that it had anything to do with VW buses.
 
 Nope, Its about VW busses, just has nothing to do with yours. ;) sorry if
 I misunderstood your message &amp; you were just kidding.
  &gt;&gt;

what !!!! you used the word Westfailure for a web site that is not about The 
Westfailure?    Well that sounds like a lot of misdirection to me.  I thought 
your web address was a sort of shrine to that bus.  hm... why not?
