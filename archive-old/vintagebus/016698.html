This has been beaten to death over and over and over and over and over...

Look up the Hoover sermon on it.  He has a lot of experience with 
both aircraft *and* VW's *and* synthetic oil *and* dino oil.

The latest-and-greatest isn't always best for a given application.
GL-5 isn't that great for my bus's tranny.  Windows 2000 probably isn't
the best OS choice for a 486.

I tried synthetic in my 911, and it leaked like a seive!  Synthetic
finds it way thru places you never imagined!   I basicallly wasted
$250 worth of oil.
