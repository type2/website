&gt; I don't like running without the same tyres on - and over here(UK) it is

Hi Paul,
We know how you feel about not having the same sized tire for a spare!  There 
are several routes out here in the USA you can go about one hundred miles 
between gas stations let alone find a tire shop, and lots of towns out there 
that close at sundown!
Our modern spares here only allow you supposedly to do 50 MPH and only drive 
on the spare for 500 miles.
