Subject: '59 Kombi...maiden voyage

Well I made it back from a trip Sunday with enough time to hop in my 
bus and take it into town for our VW club meeting. The bus still 
doesn't have emergency brake and isn't inspected, but i drove it 
anyway.

I got a lot of positive feedback on the bus even though I'm not 
totally done with it. Before it was all said and done I had put over 
60 miles on the bus. This was the maiden voyage and boy was it a 
blast!

I found out with the help of my wife that when my speedo says 40mph 
I'm actually going 45mph. So it looks like my bus will cruise fine at 
55-60mph and could possibly go faster. Daytime driving was great on 
the backroads and around town. Nighttime driving on the main highway 
was nice too. Not a lot of traffic and a nice cool evening. Fun Fun 
Fun!!!

Today my emergency brake cables came from Ronnie at 
http://www.oldvolks_dot_com , so I'll try to get them installed ASAP. 
Then I SHOULD be able to pass an inspection.

I had a little trouble with second gear. Tranny grinds going into it. 
If I'm REAL carefull and baby it into 2nd with low RPM's and slow 
smooth shifting, it's fine. So is this an old bus thing? Or do I need 
to start saving for a tranny while this one is wearing out?
