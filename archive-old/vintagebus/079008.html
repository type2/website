Subject: Re: [VB] lil' pivoting window seal replacement

So - I got em together OK .. unfortunately I broke both rubber things
because one of my frames was a little twisted ... fortunately there was
enough rubber left to work with.  Jig smig - I just used lots of soap and
pushed em in and then snugged em in like Flynn -  nicely with a couple of
pipe clamps and two blocks of wood.  But ... how do you cut the excess
rubber off behind the swoosh ... that is going to be almost impossible ...
my 60 has the big swoosh so ... how do you reach in there ... do you just
cut near the edge and then pull out the excess by tearing the rubber?

TIA
