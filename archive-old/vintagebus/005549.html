Well this afternoon I was trying to balance the carbs on this engine and was
getting nowhere.  All of a sudden I just stopped the engine, and sat back
and just thought for a minute.

The engine obviously has problems.  If I have low compression on the 1 &amp; 2
side, then how do I ever expect to get the carbs to balance?

At this point, I just put all my tools away, cleaned up the shop, and then
started dismantling the engine.  I went from a fully assembled engine to
nothing more than a long block minus the heads.  I'm debating whether to
rebuild an engine since I need the experience or just do a long block swap -
$695 exchange at CRAM in Omaha.

Anyway, as usual, I'll keep you all posted.
