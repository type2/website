I've seen these chrome &quot;covers&quot; at swaps before.  They look
like they just drop right on top of the lense.  Pretty slick
if you ask me, and a damn sight better than the faded 
silvering on the insides of the lights.

&gt; I was looking in the Bentley Transporter manual and noticed

&gt; on most buses.  The ones in the book look like a glass lens
&gt; with a chrome metal band around the outside, mounted to the body.
