Just got my copy of Hoover's Sermons on CD and man, this thing is *WAY
BETTER* than I thought it was gonna be.  Bob's initial comments set the
stage for this info packed encyclopedia.  True, there are no pictures, no
frills, no flashing lights or fancy sound, but neither will you find this in
a shop manual, which this basically is except with a human touch and with
explicit explanations for just about how everything works on a VW - it's
great!

The first thing that hit me is that there are *WAY* more sermons than I ever
had collected or that I known had existed.  Also, they are all organized so
you can get to the info you need pretty darn quick.  Another good point that
is worthy of mention is that in the introduction, Hoover mentions how in a
shop manual, everything is shown on new, factory fresh vehicles - what sets
this CD apart from those factory manuals is that when you are fixing 20, 30,
40 year + vehicles, not everything is going to be as it is pictured in the
book. This is where Hoover's Sermons come into play - he deals with VW
problems and repairs with the age factor figured in.  I think if someone had
mentioned this aspect of the CD to me sooner, I wouldn't have hesitated to
buy it.

Thanks to Ron at the Bus Depot for his quick delivery of the Sermons and
those awesome $12 Venezualan VW Bus mudflaps - they're cool!

BTW:  I'm not associated with the sale or promotion of the Hoover CD's - I'm
just bestowing my initial reaction and opinion to the list in case anyone is
unsure of purchasing them.  I'm gonna hang on to this CD forever...
