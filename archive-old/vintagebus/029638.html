What about the guy down the street. What's so different about him.
There's no difference between a celeb or the guy down the street that
wants to buy a bus and get into it. Should he not be alowed to join in
just because lots of people know him? That smells of separatism and
elitism. Who cares I think it's cool!

&gt; Oh great!  Another celebrity wanna-busser.  The ultimate in me-too-ism.
&gt; Who's next?  Leno?  Maury Povich?  Regis? George W?

&gt; &gt; Well OCTO came and went with one great find. Eddie Van Halen! He showed
&gt; &gt; up looking to buy a bus and seemed determined to buy the right one.
&gt; &gt; Everyone around at one point went crazy and I will have pics up in the
&gt; &gt; morning of the whole show so you'll just have to wait. How cool is that!
&gt; &gt; Eddie Van Halen driving a 23 window! He's got taste.
