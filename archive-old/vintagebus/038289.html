Thanks Thom and others for the responses. The motor which I would like to
protect is a stock 1600 DP so I would like to go a loooot lower than that. I
wil probably need to go ahead and fit a tach. My dash had a dealer accessory
fuel gauge fitted and since I am a non Vintage Nazi and I'm cheap I have
replaced my crappy old bus speedo with a bug unit that has an integral fuel
gauge. I can therefore fit a small tach in the fuel gauge spot and it
shouldn't look too much more freakish.

Later

Michael
