&lt;&lt; What does that actually mean? Does a '66 or '67 have a subfloor? I've

Hi Jerry,
The sunroof buses and double door buses both have subfloors in them to 
stiffen the frame/body.  In otherwords you need a sunroof bus or a double 
door to install a sunroof roof on without any other work.  Any other type of 
bus would require installing a full subfloor first.  Eric&amp;Barb
