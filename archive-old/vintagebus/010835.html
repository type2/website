ps. I also found some seal which might solve the Safari leakage problem,

stay tuned as I'm going to try these on my DD as soon as I install my

Safari's.  Still looking for weld in tabs and wing nut's.




your safari's leak in Arizona?  WHere people throw out their wiper motors? 
Let me guess you use a hose to check :)
