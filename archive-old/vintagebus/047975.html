&lt;&lt; As for bearings? I have no idea what they are talking about, I have never
had
 that problem. &gt;&gt;
Hi, 
Think we figured out your problem understanding our statement.  The bug and
type3 have only one bearing out in each of the rear axles that carry them.
The pre-1968 buses on the other hand have 4 bearings in each axle.  This is
due to the buses being 400 lbs. heavier than the bug.  Plus the 1955-63 bus is
rated to carry about 1600 lbs. and the 1964-67 a full 2,000 lbs., so the
wieght nessatates having more bearings.  Like we said we put 100,000 miles on
our bus every 5 years and that is when you can start to say if things work or
not.     Eric &amp; Barb
