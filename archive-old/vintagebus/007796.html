Has anyone purchased in canada that will be driven in the USA? Was it
difficult to have the bus pass the EPA requirements, bumper safety
requirements, headlight requirements, etc. Are there exemptions for older
vehicles? How old does the vehicle have tobe to qualify for any exemptions,
if applicable.


Thanks
