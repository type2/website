&lt;&lt; Hi everybody,
 This is Diana from Vancouver BC, I'm currently in Tennessee, back where I got
 my bus from originally. 
 We're getting close to 4000 miles right now, headed on to Georgia, then New
 Orleans, then Las Vegas, then home.
 
 Bus has been running not too badly since my recent rebuild, but I do notice
 recently a bit of sluggishness and the gas mileage is dropping, from 25-27 
mpg
 at the beginning of the trip to about 21-23 mpg now.  This is especially 
strange
 since we're not in the mountains like we were for the first week.  I notice
 I'm smelling gas a lot but can't find a leak anywhere.  Oil temperature has
 been pretty high the whole trip, up around 260 - 280.  On sunny days I have
 to keep it at 50 mph or less or the temperature goes over 280 and I'm trying
 to avoid that.  
 
 It's been pouring rain the past few days so I haven't managed to do anything
 to check for problems but I plan to do another tune-up soon (did one in 
Colorado)
 so maybe that will shed some light on the subject.
  &gt;&gt;

260-280!!!! Those are some pretty high oil temps.   Really too high.  I would 
do the tune up ASAP, wonder why it runs so hot, try thicker oil?  Adjust 
valves, check to see if somethings in the fan, new cap etc adjust timing.

Berg says that above 225 oil degrades and loses its lubricating properties.  
I have noticed that when my oil gets hot like that, when I drain it to change 
it the old oil has a weird drippy gloppy consistancy.   I was checking out 
the Berg website  and interestingly it says that the stock tin does the best 
for cooling, and also that having the thermostat flaps also helps.   These 
are people who have run motors for decades and 100s of K miles.  kinda neat.

BTW, I do wonder what oil temps people run. (freeway hauling, not around town)

I hear some people run 230-250 hauling on road trips.  Some people tell me 
they run 160 in the desert on road trips, and I do believe them (thousands 
wouldn't).  How's the oil spit test for boiling temp show people?  

I tended to run 190-210F  (90 to 100C)freeway speeds when I was south in the 
warm, dry, in well loaded bus with stuff on roof rack and typeIV doghouse 
cooler AE case 1600sp stock muffler, thermostat installed,   engine ran 
cooler at  3K rpms than 3500rpms.  Hotter when going up long grades, it did 
get up to 230 a few times up long grades in the heat of the afternoon. I 
figure I was happy when it stayed at 100C.

Driving around on Sat it was cool here in the PNW, and freeway driving I went 
about 160 miles engine oil temp was at 80 C (about 175 F)
