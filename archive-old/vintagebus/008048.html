Well Volks, here's the latest (not much to say though.)

I've sent the engine case off to Painter's Grinding in Denver, CO in my
custom built wooden box just for engine cases and my parts should be here
any day now.  I also found out that the guru has a really nice used set of
90.5's that still have the cross hatching in them that he'll cleanup, mic
out, and hone for a grand total of $70.  So I'll have this brand new set of
P/C's to send back.  I would consider selling them for what I paid for them
though if someone is interested.  They will be cofap 90.5's I'm pretty sure.

Later
