Hi Thomas,
  If one can remove an engine they can remove a tranny, though it is  easier 
to have a friend to help.  Figure at least $600.00 to have the  center section 
rebuilt properly.  If you want to go Freeway Flier you will  need two other 
types of core trannies or more $$$$.   Then if your RGB  outer lower roller 
bearings are in good shape figure 200.00 for you to replace  the other RGB 
bearings, brakes, etc...
  While the tranny is out.  It is wise to have the rear  shift linkage 
removed out the rear to have its bushings, front &amp; rear seals  replaced, and the 
tube it rides in cleaned out and regreased.  Makes for  MUCH smoother and tighter 
shifting.
  With the RGBs apart you should have the mounting bolt holes drilled  and 
tapped deeper to allow for longer bolts to keep them from pulling  out.
  We went with FF tranny and 1641SP engine, and are now saving quite a  bit 
of $$$ in just gas savings by getting 23+ MPG _at_ 60 MPH on our long  trips.
  Gary Zinc in Maple Valley does tranny rebuilds, and if you are  interested 
just Pmail us and we will send you our Modified Tranny Info about the  FF.
