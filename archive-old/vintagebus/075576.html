&gt;So, as everyone knows, tail lights on an early bus are kind of a joke.

I dunno...keep the connections clean and tight and they're bright
enough for me.  If you've gone to 12 V, you can get higher-wattage
bulbs, but don't get too crazy or you'll melt lenses.  Might be
smart to install cheap repop lenses with the higher-wattage bulbs.

&gt;I have a set of 70's fog lights new and still in the box.  If I used em
&gt;as brake lights would the fact that they are yellow fog lights be an issue?

It might be confusing to people behind you.  Normally two yellow rear
lights on at once would be hazard flashers.  They will probably figure
it out if they come on with your brakes, but you don't want people to
have to figure out your tail lights...you want them to _know_.

The US feds (FMVSS) say brake lights are supposed to be red; your
province's motor vehicle laws may also require red lights.  Fog lights
also tend to have a wide but not very tall beam pattern; you may want
to aim the lights up a bit instead of straight back.  Finally, wiring
these in parallel with your existing tail lights might be a little
much for the brake light switch and turn signal flasher.  The best
thing would be to install two relays, one on each side: the coil
goes across the hot wire and ground of your existing bulb, one
contact goes through a fuse to the battery, and the other contact
goes to the new light.
