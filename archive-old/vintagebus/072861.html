Subject: Re: [VB] Wide 5 converter plates for late model discs

When I bought my current project bus the PO had already converted the
rear to IRS and mounted later model discs and drums from Bay buses.
But along with the bus also came a whole stack of wide 5 rims that were
originally on the bus.
------------------------- Clip ---------------------------------
I had a full set of very nice BMW rims and I started looking for adapters
and found that everything was &quot;off road only&quot;. I also had the same
problem with a set of Mercedes alloys, adapters 'yes' but off road only.
It wasn't any problem getting the adapters, just that they carried the
warning of off road.
I've seen some very nice Split window busses with the EMPI wide five
wheels and lowered about 4&quot;.
I recently bought a Porsche with FUCHS wheels.
The PO left the car outside and somebody picked the wheels off of it one
night.
He had full coverage insurance and claims that the OEM wheels and new
tires were over $2000.00 to his insurance company.
I had a 356c with a set of FUCHS wheels and it's the first and only set
of wide five FUCHS wheels I've ever seen.
All this seems to be beating around the bush but the 66 I had was
converted to IRS with a sway bar and had a late model ball joint front
beam with sway bar.
The fellow that did the conversion may have known something that I don't
but he managed to keep the wide five brake drums.
It does seem like it might be worthy of the expense and wheel track
change if you could get disk brakes on the front and wider drums on the
rear.
I've seen conversion kits to accomplish both the front disks and the IRS
but never seen anybody do this from donor parts.
