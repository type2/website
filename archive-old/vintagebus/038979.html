&gt; &lt;&lt;  Is the alternator THAT much better??? &gt;&gt;
&gt; Hi Mark,
&gt; It depends on how much wattage used over how much time while camping, and how
&gt; many miles of driving between, how many batteries in your camper, and what
&gt; type and size of batteries to really figure out if an alternator would be
&gt; absolutely nessasary for you.  We have had friends go to alternator to find
&gt; they are more likely to burn out due to wiring problems/mistakes, but if you
&gt; make sure your wiring is in good condition that should most likely not be a
&gt; problem.  Also the alternator requires a special fuel pump which you can not
&gt; rebuild, a special shorter fuel pump push rod, alternator stand and probably
&gt; the fanshroud to alternator tin.    Eric&amp;Barb

Also be sure to grab the voltage regulator (and enough wire to splice it
into your harness or construct a harness for it).  The regulators are
quite different.  The Bug's regulator should be under the back seat, at
the far edge of the driver's side.

I transplanted a '73 Bug alternator setup (65 amps) into my 67 kombi
(already 12V), because it puts out more current and needs less
maintenance.  The brushes run on slip rings and last almost forever.  Do
be careful with the wiring -- it's worth putting some split-loom or
spiral wrap around the wiring harnesses in the engine compartment (and
just about everywhere else!) to protect them from abrasion.  Those are
available at auto parts stores.

It's also a good idea to carry a spare fuel pump since since as E&amp;B say,
it can't be rebuilt and the new ones I've seen are junk from Brazil.
If in doubt ask for the pump for a '74 Beetle, since that's the first
year where they all had alternators and the last year before fuel injection.
I'm not sure if the tin disc is different, since I transplanted the tin, fan,
and whole doghouse fan shroud along with the alt.
