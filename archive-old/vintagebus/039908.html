i know ive bored you  guys with this before... but here in Ohio i had a ONE 
TIME fee of $17.50 to display my YOM plates. they were actually registered 
on my last bus i parted out, so as to avoid the hassle of the DMV i just 
switched the vin tag and m-code tag... numbers match. the vin in the engine 
compartment has appeared to be covered or something.
