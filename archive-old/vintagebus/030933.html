On Saturday I purchased an original paint Green/Green '58 Standard from
VW Howard of Lake Havasu City, AZ.  It's a sweet Bus - some rocker rust,
a little floor rust, a nasty crease in the passenger rear corner but 77K
original miles with a dealer-installed gas heater, factory ambulance step,
front folding steps, and 6 pop-out windows.  It's about 90% complete with
all bumpers, seats, floor mats, engine parts, etc..  A wanted list will
be coming soon.  ;)

Early Sat. morning, I hooked up with another listee, Andy (PO of a '56 Westy)
who was heading out to Lake Havasu to look at Ronnie's (http://www.oldvolks_dot_com)
1958 Single Cab. Everything went smooth and we arrived in Havasu about noon.
 We made a quick stop at VW Howard's residence to check out the Standard,
then headed over to Ronnie's shop where he gave us the grand tour.  There
was a NICE 21-window there that both Andy and I were salivating over, along
with Ronnie's collections.  We then made the quick trip over to Ronnie's
house for the Truck viewing.  Ronnie broke open the Capri-Sun stacked fridge
in his garage so you know I had to down a few while Andy checked out the
Truck.  Once the Truck business was taken care of, it was back over to VW
Howard's house.

Once there, Ronnie &quot;king of window installs&quot; reinstalled the windshields
with the 4-year old semi-dried out WCM rubber I brought with me.  He popped
them in like nobody's business, loaned me a safety chain for the tow bar,
and we were on our way.  We noticed the driver's front tire was really weather-checked
and made a mental note to check it every time we stopped.

About 5 miles out of Havasu, I heard a clang and Andy informed me that the
front emblem had flown off the Standard.  We made a quick visual marker
of where we were because there was no where to make a u-turn in sight. 
15 minutes later, we were back to where we *thought* it had flown off. 
I jumped out and starting walking along the highway edge, looking for it.
 I walked about a 1/8 mile when Andy pulled up ahead of me and parked to
help look.  Right as he stopped, I see the right rear hubcap go flying off
into the dirt.  I started running and grabbed it and we both began walking
up the shoulder looking for the emblem.  About 15 minutes of walking along
the highway edge yielded nothing so we began walking back.  We were about
1/2 way back to his Truck when I noticed a collapsed tree.  I figured I
better dig through it just in case.  No luck in the tree but just as I turn
around to come back up the ridge to the highway what do I see but the emblem
laying there face down!  Total luck!  Apparently if you take a light green
emblem, fade the paint, slap on some surface rust, and throw it into the
desert sand, it is pretty good at camoflauging itself.

Everything went fine for the next couple hours but some harsh winds kept
our traveling speed down to 45 mph.  We were about an hour away from my
house and the sun had just set when we came upon the last back-roads freeway
junction leading up to my house.  I'd been the way once before and I was
sure the ramp connecting the 2 freeways was a smooth transition but as we
approached it at about 35 mph, it turned out to be a 75 degree turn with
a big concrete curb to &quot;help&quot; you make the transition.  Needless to say,
the turn was underestimated. In addition, someone had decided this was good
place to lay down some loose gravel so as Andy slammed on the brakes and
the front end of his truck skidded off the road, I flipped around and waited
for the &quot;pop&quot; sound of the tow bar popping off his hitch and my Bus either
laying over or yanking us around.  But luck was with us and even though
the truck ended up 90 degrees to the road, the Standard made the turn with
no trouble at all and was sitting nicely still on the pavement.  Andy was
totally freaked but we found no damage to the Bus or any of the towing equipment.
 Even the weather-checked driver's front tire was ok.

We took it real slow from there and made it to my house about an hour and
a half later.

Thanks go out to VW Howard for selling me the Bus and installing all new
brakes, Ronnie for putting the windshields back in and hooking me up with
Andy in the first place to get the Bus home, and Andy for pulling the Bus
back for me.
