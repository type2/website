Now I will say this!

In the past ten days I have been in the hospital three days.  I have an
inner ear infection so damned bad I am seeing double.  I am taking 5
different drugs that fight one another and make the sickness even worse.

My business is suffering because I have not been able to open my doors in 14
days.  I would not have been able to open them today had it not been for two
buddies.  They did everything while I laid flat of my back trying to avoid
hurling what little I have left in my body.

To top it all off a 25 year old young woman gets brutally murdered only a
couple hundred miles down he road after recieving help from one of the AIRS
members, a group that I had the major hand in creating and forming.

I am tired folks.  I am sick, and looking at losing most all I have aquired
since trying to rebuild my &quot;normal&quot; life after my travels around the
country.  Right now I am putting all I can into lots of things and to be
honest I don't need to read this argument, niether does the list.

I can tell you all that changes may come to AIRS but it is not going to
happen soon.  The fact is that nothing has happened yet to move it to go
private.  

If NEATO/LIMBO suits your needs best, then take your name off the AIRS list,
it's that simple!  This argument has already been played out and discussed
and until the majority of the AIRS membership says to go private it will
not.

Right now, let it rest till it can be reasonabl addressed.  Wade didn't
mention any name in his post.  Damn man, the guy is getting married today.
Let it lay!

Please kill this thread, if ya got something to say about AIRS p mail me at
cjford_at_altamaha_dot_net.  I will reply in time and address the issues you have
with honest forthright thought and opinion.  If you don't believe me, try
me!

Andy I love ya like a brother and you know that, but chill till I get back
on my feet.
