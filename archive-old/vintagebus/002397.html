Subject: Re: 10mm nyloc nut in engine case?

&gt;Changed the oil in Zorm's new engine yesterday and found....  a 10mm
&gt;nyloc nut and a washer (for a 10mm).  I've been racking my brain trying
&gt;to figure out what it's from and just can't resolve it.


I'll bet you a dollar to a dog turd it's the nut that holds the pickup
strainer down. My single cab had a four quart deep sump when I bought it. No
strainer in it. It dropped that nut and sucked it up into the oil pump,
broke the driven gear, so no oil pump. Seized the motor before the oil light
came on, since it wasn't hooked up. Had a pressuren guage, didn't check it
often enough, apparently. Lucky guy, you are. I used all bolts on the sump
plate when I rebuilt. Heads to the inside of the case. I might strip the
threads, but I won't pull one out of the case. Got a strainer now, too. The
nut can be replaced without disassembling, but it is a bear. Here's the hot
ticket: Select a bolt for the job, about 1&quot; long, roughly. Get someone with
a MIG welder to strike a bead and let off, thus tacking the wire to the end,
opposite the head. Feed out some wire and clip it off, leaving about an
inch. Get you some tiny needlenose pliers and a bunch of patience and get
that bolt up in the case and get the wire stuck down through the pickup tube
bracket and out the case hole. Spin the wire with your trembling fingers
until it's down snug. Double nut it to tighten it against the pickup tube,
clip the wire off and congratulate yourself. A stud you can't pull and a nut
you can't lose again.
