 I think you are right there.
 
 I am familiar with the differences in gear rings on the flywheels and
 starter gears and also the busings and holes in the trans case.... I
 had, until you and E and B pointed out, believed that the 200mm 6v
 flywheel was the same od as a 12v 200mm.... with the corect gear teeth
 for a 6v starter.  And that isnt even getting into o-ring differences
 and paper vs metal endplay shims...
 
  So what did the trans case look like for the 12v option buses? In
 comparison to the 67 and later 12v flywheels and the 67 and later trans
 cases? 
   &gt;&gt;
now will the listee with the original 12V 65 bus please stand up?
