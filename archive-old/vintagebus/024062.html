Melissa,

My personal opinion with regards to buying parts at a swapmeet is this. 
SUSPECT EVERYONE...TRUST NO ONE!! I know this is highly cynical, but
believe me (hey...I'm not selling you anything), if you trust someone
you don't know to tell you what you are buying, you're bound to get
taken.

Know EXACTLY what it is that you want and EXACTLY what it looks like.  
I even take a parts # book with me sometimes when I'm looking for
something I'm not sure about.  Unless you've got wads of cash to spend
you should find out the going price of the parts you're looking for.  
Knowing what things are worth allows you to pass on grossly overpriced
things as well a snatch a good deal when you see it.  Believe me I've
had my share of BAD purchaces and a few good ones too.

With time comes experience.  Go to as many as you can.  BTW non VW swaps
can be good places to find stuff too.  It just takes a lot longer to
sift through the junk. 

Personally, I look for one major part that I really need first (for me
its Westy stuff) making mental notes on other stuff.  I go through the
whole place once, and then back a second time to see if the &quot;B&quot; stuff I
need is still there and in my price range.

Lastly, have fun!  Even if you buy nothing, hopefully you'll learn
something and meet one or two good people along the way.  Good hunting!
