Subject: Old &quot;newbie&quot; VW message

Found the message below in the Google newsgroup archives. Probably 
was my first attempt to find info about &quot;vw vans&quot; on the internet. 
Have come a long way in 7 years!

I was wondering what year was the last year the vans had the 'V' shape
across the hood. I believe they had split windows in the front as well.
What about the 21 window buses?

   Also, can engines from the bugs be put into the vans of this type? I've
got a '73 super beetle with a great engine in it, but the body is trashed.

If anyone can help, or point me in the direction for help, I would
appreciate it greatly.
