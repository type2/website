&gt;
&gt;So I was driving around in my 1962 DC today, and I figured I'd pull over 
&gt;to adjust the load in back.  As I stopped on the side of the road, I
&gt;turned on the hazards and turned off the key.  Now here's the problem:
&gt;the engine kept running in time with the hazards.  It was keeping time
&gt;with the click from the flasher relay.  Later, I tried to replicate the
&gt;problem and noticed that it would only keep running when I had my foot
&gt;on the brake with hazards on.

After looking at the wiring diagram I think this is inherent in the
design.  (Wiring diagrams at http://www.vintagebus_dot_com/wiring , thanks
Thom!)  When the turn signal switch is off, it connects 54St (wire from
brake light switch) to HR and HL (rear light wires) so the brake lights
will come on when you step on the brakes.  When the hazard switch J6
is on, it applies pulsing voltage from the flasher J to HR and HL to
blink the rear lights.  When you step on the brakes with the hazards
on, this closes J3 (brake light switch).  Current flows from the
hazard switch through HR and HL to the turn signal switch, through
the turn signal switch to 54St, through 54St and the brake light
switch to the second-from-the-right fuse, backfeeding circuit 15,
the ignition/hot-with-key-on circuit.

Normally that second-from-the-right fuse is fed from the ignition
switch and the current (*) flows the other way: from that fuse, through
the brake light switch, and to the turn signal switch.

&gt;Also, only my rear lights work on the hazards.  I never was able to get 
&gt;the front lights to work right.

Sounds like a problem with the hazard relay J1 or the connections to
it.  This relay is used to connect both front lights together and to
battery voltage when the hazards are on.  This way the flasher only
&quot;sees&quot; the load of the two rear bulbs instead of all four bulbs.
On my '64, this relay is on the bottom front edge of the parcel
tray, behind the right kick panel, halfway between the heater duct
and the passenger door.  To test it, make sure terminal 30 has
battery voltage all the time, and terminal 86 has pulsing voltage
when the hazards are on.  If this is OK make sure it's well-clipped
to the body; this is the ground on the relay I have.  Run a jumper
wire from 30 to 87 and make sure the left front light comes on, and
try it again between 30 and 87b and make sure the right front light
comes on.  If all this checks out, the relay is probably bad - if
not it's probably a broken or disconnected wire.  Be careful when
hooking the jumper to 30 - it's an unfused feed straight from the
battery, so don't let the other end of your jumper ground out on
anything!

Good luck!
