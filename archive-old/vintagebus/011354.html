&gt; &lt;&lt;Extensions do add inaccuracy to the torque, as they add to the

&gt; I have to disagree with everyone here.  The length of the extension
makes a
&gt; lot of difference in the amount of torque applied.  It increases the
length of
&gt; the wrench, and thus the amount of torque

&lt;good explanation of lever arm's effect on torque snipped&gt;

OOPS!  I feel so misunderstood!

The extensions I was referring to are the ones that go between the
wrench and the socket, not the &quot;cheater&quot; extensions that change the
length of the lever arm.  Placement of an extension between the wrench
and the socket does not change the torque at the socket if you are
careful to keep everything lined up and to apply force in a direction
perpendicular to the plane of the wrench and extension (in other
words, you need to support the end of the wrench that to which the
extension is attached).
