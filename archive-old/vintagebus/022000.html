I am looking for a group of busses to head to havasu with on friday.  I will 
be followed by a nice big red c*_at_$! truck in which those of you who need it 
may throw your tools and stuff in.  Will be bringing the tow bar in case 
anybody breaks down.  Which hopefully wont be me ;) but if you dont have 
enough space in the bus let me know!
Big stuff welcome!

Hope to EVERYONE there

look for the guy with blue hair!  thanks to my freaky girlfriend and major 
lack of sleep.
