Subject: Binz question

Alright, now Im sure ALOT of you guys have seen the binz double cab 
advertised on ebay.
I talked to a few guys who have seen it personally and say it is BEYOND 
wasted.
That they feel unsafe sitting in it because the frames THAT far gone.

I also have been told that binz made those as early as 1954.

(assuming this binz is beyond wasted in terms of the frame)

I was curious what it would take to do the conversion on another singlecab 
(Im serious! Stop laughing!)
I was thinking a non-barndoor 55 singlecab.
European, semiphores, barndoor front bumper, flat lenses, etc. etc.
Am i dreaming or is the conversion fairly simple?

John howard?
Anyone?

Regards, Greg Noble
