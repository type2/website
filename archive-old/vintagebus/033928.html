Subject: cruising down the freeway
To: Vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

I know it's not friday but I read half a million threads about bus music and 
not one mentioned the alltime best bus driving song, The Who's &quot;Magic Bus!&quot;   
DUH!  It was the first album I played when I bought &quot;Magic&quot; my 1970 Westy six 
years ago.  

On a lighter note, or quieter, however you prefer, my Westy is no longer 
bleeding and now has a new Varga wheel cylinder on it's back left leg and is 
cruising once again.  The schwinn is parked and my rear-end is grateful.  So 
all you spring breakers, watch for the white westy with the hippified driver 
bouncing in the front seat while cruising down the freeway!

66 Micro (has the flu and a bad cough)
70 Westy (happy as ever and &quot;On The Road Again&quot;)
89 Schwinn (in storage once again)
