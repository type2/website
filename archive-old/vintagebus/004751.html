Any parts they are willing to make, if at a decent cost and quailty , i'll
use if either of these are not met i will keep doing as i have done scrounge
used or fab myself. I fab alot of parts but they are time consuming and a
pain in the a** alot of times and i don't make alot of money on them for the
time i have invested in them.
my wish list :
Front floor sections
any cargo door sections
rear corner sections
battery trays
correct patterns for older buses and later splits as well , yes there is
more than one style.
doglegs all styles
all b-pillar posts and rear cargo door inners
