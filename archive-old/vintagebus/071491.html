Subject: making ready - Volksfest

Well,

The bus is being loaded, the coffee is being roasted all is proceeding
according to plan.  I hope to see many of you at the Volksfest gathering in
Naches, WA.  I am looking forward to finally placing a few faces with names.
Even if you don't drink coffee, stop by the Groundzero espresso bus and say
&quot;HI&quot;  For those of you that are going and camping there, I should be up and
running around 7:00 - 7:30
