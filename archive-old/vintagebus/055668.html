Subject: Re: [VB] Personal lawsuit?

There are some things you can do before the fact to prevent the
disappointment but if you are talking after the fact I'm guessing a lawsuit
is the only way to go unless the seller will make it right.  If it is a
business I think web exposure does wonders.  There has been a significant
amount of traffic on this list about which engine and Trans builders not to
use.

Subject: [VB] Personal lawsuit?


&gt; Someone asked me recently what their options were if they buy a Bus
&gt; cross-country and upon delivery, they find it was woefully misrepresented.
&gt; Should they file a personal lawsuit?
&gt;
&gt; Opinions welcome,
