&gt;Why not
&gt; just carry a cell phone instead of the 50 items on the list?  

I recently went on a trip and had the cell phone, but it wouldn't reach the town over the mountains.  We climbed to the top of the hill nearby and got a signal but not strong enough to call.  And that was less than 30 miles from town as the crow flies.

I can definitely say I would rather have the tools with me.  I learned that when the cell phone didn't work in the situation above.  We were in a friends bus that ran great (and had perfect original interior), but we had it stuck in the sand in the middle of nowhere.  Hadn't seen a soul in 24 hours.  Without the cell phone we had to get ourselves out.  I would have loved to have had a piece of plywood, a hammer, a WORKING flashlight, and my Hazet lug wrench.  We scrounged for wood and sheet metal in the desert, used a 19mm wrench, and a stock bus jack, but with the right tools we would have been on the road much sooner.    Wish we had the gas can too, because hitting reserve on a dirt road in the middle of nowhere is not fun, but does make for a good adventure.  The hint for today is make sure your grease cap on the front axle is not loose if you go by mileage to gauge how much gas you have left.  Spedometers aren't real accurate if the grease cap spins.
