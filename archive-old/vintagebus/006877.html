Actually that is not correct, the axles from split case transmissions have a
little ball in the paddle end that is spring loaded, what this is for I
don't know, but taken 2 split cases apart and both of these had the ball
bearings in the paddles, I have another 58 split case I'll eventually pull
apart and will report on those axles.

ps. save those good axles (core charge is outragous now)

Well sh*t.  That's kind of a bummer, because they lost out on a rebuild,
and I gave away my axles thinking they were not usable.  It's been an
expensive summer.  Oh well, live and learn.  I guess I'm going to remember
REAL good that all axles from after barndoors to 67 are the same.  Not one
of lifes great lessons, but a good thing to know if you drive old buses.:)
Thanks Clara.
