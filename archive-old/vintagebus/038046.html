How messed up is the actual wiring?  what does not work?   Is it an 
incomplete 12V conversion?   I have found   That if there is a bunch of extra 
stuff, I just pull all the added bits out, toss them out the window (best if 
the buses owner is there) and hook everything up as per wiring diagram with 
cleaned connections.   Do you have a Bentley?  it has a wirng diagram and the 
vintagebus_dot_com has the version in colour.    also, it is a good idea to clean 
oil/grease off the wires, as it makes the rubber insulation brittle.

I was wondering how hard is it to put a new  wiring harness in.  How well 
are the harnesses labled? Do they have very good instructions? To me it 
looks like it is an issue of taking your time?

The reasons i am wanting to rewire it are i am planning to come out for the 
OCTO show(don't want any fires), and the wiring is a mess
I also have what looks like an old bosch 6 volt coil wired into my wiring.  
What is it there for (is it a booster for the old wiring?)
