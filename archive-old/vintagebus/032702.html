Subject: Re: [VB] Score! jealous

since we're going down and down on price, i'll chime in before jp tells us
of his $2 truck.
i unknowingly bought a 67 westy, complete, for $35. i was just standing
next to it when the auctioneer came past and said &quot;ok, what's your number&quot;
and it was mine. this was at the IRS auction for a resto place in waco,tx
called farm fresh a few years ago. after another person and i were in a
frenzy on trying to figure how to get 3 busses from texas to albuquerque,
we arranged it so shipping was practically nothing. i rebuilt the motor and
drove it for many years after.

&gt; Since everyone was talking about deals on Busses I thought I'd add mine.
