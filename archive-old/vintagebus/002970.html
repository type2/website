&gt; that would be the the limobus affectionately known as
&gt; the westfailure.the proud owner is kyle of this list
&gt; and ABC. a small block chevy 400ci, moves the
&gt; westfailure with out fail. as you check the photos
&gt; from BBBV, kyle won the raffle motor.

Nope, the wife won the raffle motor. As everyone who knows me is well aware,
I am far to busy with more important things to pay attention at the raffles,
thus the boss lady does the raffling. Besides, she doesn't give me any money
to buy tickets.
