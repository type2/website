When I sewed together my ragtop and installed it I think I used that self adhesive foam rubber door and window gasket stuff on a roll from Home Depot.  My ragtop has never leaked, although my rain gutter full of holes sure does.  I'm not sure what came on them since mine have always been really dry and crusty by the time they made it into my hands.  Can't help you out on the headliner material since none of mine have a headliner yet.  Good luck.

Richard
