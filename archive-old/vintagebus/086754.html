Subject: mystery person

Anyone know the handle lcolomb1976. I was bidding for a bay 1969 on 
ebay and this handle came in and did some weird bidding. It seemed to 
be trying to get the price up
I know this is the split list and the name is probably only for ebay 
but what the heck
The bus is a 69 in naples florida it is white with a brown and tan 
stripe. also has a camper interior interior and dual port engine. 46k 
on clock and vin 239233041
thanks frank
