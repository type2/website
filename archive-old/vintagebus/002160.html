wow, someone on one of these lists must have a direct line to jb's! just got
a call from him and he promises to have it to me by late next week. whoever
made the call, thanks!

btw, he said my heater is the first nos heater of this type he has ever
seen. this is the type that mounts under the parcel tray, often called a
&quot;suicide heater&quot;. he also said he is selling his own repro of this type of
heater if anyone's interested. refer to my ealier post for my experience...

thanks again,

tony
