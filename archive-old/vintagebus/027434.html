Subject: Re: 6v gas gauge, 12v car.

Hello again,
   I am still having problems with somthing that seems so easy.  This
gauge thing.  There's only the sender and the gauge that can go wrong.
My sender is a new float kind with the arm that floats up and down.  My
old one is the tube kind with the internal float.  Would it matter which
one of these is used.  How can they break (what part of it can break
down)?  They both seem to work, but when both are used with the two
different gauges(one new, one old) they both read reverse and only half
full.  They do work within this range though.(giving me a broad idea
about my gas situation).  Has ANYONE gone through all this?    My bus is
a 67 and it is 12v.  Are gas gauges different throughout the years, and
why so?  I'm sick of being on a date and jumping out in the middle of
the evening  to shake my whole bus and the people insided just to hear
if I have any gas.  Jeez.  Any help?   Anyone know a good site to search
for used parts for old busses?  Online junk yards etc.?   There's not a
whole lot here in Hawaii.   Thanks  ---J
