Subject: Re: [VB] 65 Slash rear bumper

would it matter?  If you want the kind the bus originally came with, ya it 
does matter.   

The rear 65 bumper issue came up at some point in th past,and I tried to get 
an idea from people who had original buses who they swore had the original 
rear bumper, which of course is the one usually left off, and later replaced, 
and there was a vague idea of when th bumper was changed, but I can't 
remember.  May 65?    'early' and 'late' are relative.  So you can take up 
the torch and figure it out, if you like.  Since no one seems to know exactly 
when it changed.

I don't know what kind my 65 came with.  it was missing when I got the bus.  
I found a slash with pea shooter cut outs at a junkyard and put it on.  later 
I got a nice straight pointy rear and put it on. It came off a deluxe and has 
the trim holes, incorrect for a camper.   No one said anything, and its been 
years.  So it doesn't really matter.

 &gt; It seems that the rear bumper was changed partway through the 65 model 
year.  
 &gt;   I've seen VW pics with them both ways.

 &gt; &lt;&lt; I am still reviewing all my parts I got with my 65 DC. I am in bumper 
mode 
 &gt; now.
 &gt;  
 &gt;  I have a slash front bumper, which I think is correct, but I have a 
pointed 
 &gt; end rear bumper. I think
 &gt;  this is a 66-67 part based on what is on Wade's site.
 &gt;  
 &gt;  Does anyone have a slash rear bumper they want to sell or trade for a 
 &gt; pointed end?
