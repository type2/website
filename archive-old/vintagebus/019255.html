Subject: Need one 84 TypeIV head...
To: VWlist &lt;vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com&gt;

Time for me to help if I can.

Please contact me privately, if anyone has a usable
non-ebay priced head that would be put to good use.

I have a &quot;vw brother in need&quot; who seriously could use
a helping hand. My friend has a burnt valve on #3 of
his 84 Vanagon. This friend is a long time member of
the VW scene and could use a &quot;kind deed&quot;. He's living
out of his van at the moment and has a hard time
getting around.
Email if you can help. Name will be withheld for his
sake. No mark up on products will be passed along. The
head will not be resold~ just installed. Doesnt even
have to be freshly redone. Just usable.
Thanks muchly,
Jim Ellis
Phoenix
