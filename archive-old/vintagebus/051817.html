Subject: carb problem solved

I was recently asked why we changed the jet size on the 34-pict 3 carb my bro 
has been &quot;dealing&quot; with (e.g. &quot;Just curious.  Why did you change the jet 
size?&quot;)

The reason for the jet size change came from a sugggestion. the guy who built 
the dual port 1600 that is currently in my 68 bug (the one that I drove back 
and forth from Visalia to Fresno ---50-ish miles one way , daily, for three 
straight years, without an f'n breakdown) said that I should. He owns a VW 
parts house in my town and has been in the business for thirty years. He said 
that in order for an 009 distro to work with a bocar 34-pict 3 carb, a guy 
has to:
       1. set the timing at 30 degrees when it is fully advanced (high rev)

       2. make sure that the carb is &quot;tight&quot;
       
       3. change the main jet to a 135 to add fuel to compensate for the 
timing advance at idle.
       
Apparently, the issues concerning the flat spot come from the fact that he 
009's advance set-up demands more fuel from the carb. Changing the jet size 
on the main from stock (127.5) to 135 solves that problem.

by the way, the jet cost 2.50 , (yes two dollars and 50 cents) rather than 
the kajillions of dollars suggested by much of what I have read on the 'net
