&gt; &gt; On the subject of making things run cooler, I did this mod to my bus, and it
&gt; &gt; made a HUGE difference in cooling during sustained high speeds:

&gt; &gt; anyway, removing the front piece of tin allows a lot more air into the
&gt; &gt; engine bay, than what the stock louvers can supply.  I know I should watch
&gt; &gt; out for road debris getting sucked into the fan and all that.

You should also watch out for recirculation during slow speed operation.
the purpose of the tin is to put the air inlet far from the hot air
outlet, which you defeat if you remove the tin.
