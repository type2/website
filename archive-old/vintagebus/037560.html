Hi guys and gals,
   The Missouri Micros, a NEATO Chapter, are having their 7th Annual VW Fest 
next weekend Oct. 13-15 at Graham Cave State Park in Danville, MO.
   Primative camping is $7.00 per night and electric is $12.00. Registration is 
$5.00 with dash plaques until they run out.
   On Sat. afternoon we take a scenic caravan to the historic German town of 
Herman, MO for Octoberfest. On Sat evening we have a chili cook off. Then give 
away door prizes. This is a kicked back, relaxing, camping weekend. This is not 
a show. 
   Don't forget the chili cookoff on Sat. night and new air freshners for 
Sundays ride home.
   If you have any questions just let me know or check out the site at
