Subject: Re: [VB] 64 Deluxe Resto Help

If it were me, instead of going IRS for the rear end, I would just have
Rancho or some other reputable transmission shop build a freeway flyer.
It's a lot easier than messing with an IRS conversion, and gives a similar
result.  As for the 68/Disc front end, it's probably a good idea, and a mod
that I'll consider making on my bus when I win the lottery.

&gt; Thanks much for the welcome and the leads. Also wondering if anyone had
&gt; positive/negative feedback regarding the retrofit of 68/Disc front ends
and
&gt; IRS rear ends to early busses. I don't think mine will ever be destined
for
&gt; concours, so it would seem these &quot;driveability&quot; mods would be well
received.
&gt; If there is a dark downside to this I'd really want to know.
&gt;
&gt; Thanks again to all,
&gt;
&gt; JT
