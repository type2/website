Howdy All,
I just brought my new '66 Standard home last night, My first splittie!!!  Anyway, after finally getting it started, and letting it run for a few minutes, there was a big oil puddle under the center rear(toward the front of the bus) of the engine.  On the bay windows, I know that oil cooler leaks seem to spot on the drivers side toward the front of the engine.  In the splits, is it in the same place or do I probably have a main seal leaking.  If so, what is this seal actually called, so I know what to look for when doing the research.  Thanks in advance!



Peace, John Baker
