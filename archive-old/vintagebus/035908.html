Rich Kimball and Big Al both got hit by the city of Irvine for a business 
licence for EACH of the swap meet sellers, thats why the price went up........

Irvine also added lots of extra costs , Police fees etc

Just glad we still have  a place to have it.............I hope Irvine does 
not kill it with more fees next year.............
