Well, I'm new to the list. And I'm sorry this is my first post. But this
thread sparks some fuel in the fire (okay, pun intended).  I personally work
in the oil field. And when oil is above $30 a barrel (42 gallons), I work a
lot.  Presently I am working so much, my wife is complaining (buy hey, I
need the money to support my VW habit right?). When oil is less than that,
the whole oil field suffers.  It may be nice to those soccer moms that want
to drive the family SUV on the cheap, but people need to realize what is
happening to the nation as a WHOLE when gas prices are cheap.  Has anyone
priced how much a gallon of bottled water is going for lately? Better yet,
how about a gallon of DISTILLED (as in actually processed, like our oil,
instead of pumped out of the earth.) water? I buy distilled water for work
on a weekly basis.  I pay up to 92 cents for a gallon.  That's $38.64 a
barrel.  Hmmm, water more expensive than oil. The earth is literally covered
with water, and yet it's more than oil.  Now I'm not saying fuel should be
expensive, I'm just saying that it's a natural resource and price reflects
that.  Everyone looks at this problem like its the BIG oil field company
benefiting from all of this.  Yes, and No. People don't realize how big of
an industry this is. From the gas station attendants, people that make
bearings, rope, pipe, cable, steel , grease, bolts, chemicals, boats, and
the list goes on and on.  These people not only depend on the oil field,
they PROVIDE to the oil field. Well sorry to sound like a spoil sport, but
when people gripe about fuel prices, it hits me personally in the pocket
book, and doesn't let me collect any more yard art (old cars, heh). By the
way, for the books, Al Gore  wants to stop all drilling off of our shores.
Imagine how much oil and gas will be when we stop providing for our selves.
I bet it won't be nice to have the foreign countries dictating the prices
COMPLETELY.

Well, thanks for hearing me out

Pertinent VW information:
Please, anyone that lives in, near, around, or would like to visit Louisiana
come to our club car show next month.
The Cruise/Car Show is October 14-15.
We have lots of great prizes to give away from many sponsors (bags, posters,
parts etc....)
There's gonna be good Cajun atmosphere, cooking, fun and games for the kids.
I really like Type II's, and there isn't a single driver (some projects
though) Type II in our club.
It would really warm my soul to see some type II's from the list show up.
The car show is open to all VW's so bring 'em if ya got em.
And while you're there, look me up and say HI. I'm really friendly, I swear,
just don't mention the gas prices :)
Please visit our site for more information

P.S. The show is to sponsor St. Jude's Children's hospital. If anything at
all, do it for the kids.
