also Rich Yost's associate (stan) has put up a temporary neato web page,
contact any member of VTO and they can give you the address, I will be on a
road trip tomorrow (bus delivery and pick-up), yet another one coming to
Havasu, and will post the address when I get back.

&gt;How does one go about joining NEATO now that their website has ceased to
