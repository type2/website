Subject: Re: [VB] Redux Boxes?

Well, I was talking to Jake Raby at a show a few months ago, telling him
about putting a type 4 in my bus; and he said that I would need to do
something about the redux boxes because the gears aren't all that strong and
will shatter with all the torque that a type 4 engine has.  Any truth to
that?

&gt; Yes,
&gt; The redux boxes are extremely stout if all of the bearings in them
&gt; are fine.  They will deal with most any motor.  People change out the
&gt; reduction gear boxes when they want to change the final gearing on their
&gt; bus and when lowering.  I like redux boxes!  Gary Gibson
