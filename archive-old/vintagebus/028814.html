Not sure how people will take this, but I just found a flyer for the
traveling Dave show (better known as the 17th Anniversary Meet of
S*T*).  I was cleaning out the DC and found it.  The guy parked next to
me at OCTO was the S*T* booth and handed me one.  It is July 30th at the
Long Beach Veterans Stadium.  Free admission with get this....&quot;donation
of canned cat or dog food&quot; !  What aren't starving needy children or
homeless people worth collecting food for?

Any way ,I'm a swap meet whore with a need to procure parts to finish
that hulk in the garage.  I know its a bit away, but thought I'd post it
in a gesture of kindness and good will since he saw the light and
changed the date away from OCTO.

Steve
