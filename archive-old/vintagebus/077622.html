Subject: Re: [VB] '65 trans/clutch slipping?

I have washed my engines with simple green and a pressure washer.  in the compartmentt and below, and had no clutch slipping issues.  This shoudln't get stuff on your clutch.  Even if the engine is really filthoid.

If your clutch is slipping it's probably from an oil leak past the main seal

&gt; I'm assuming my clutch is slipping. I'm thinking it's possible that my
&gt; flywheel/clutch were fouled during the time it sat.  My wife cleaned the
&gt; engine with simple green/garden hose &amp; it's doubtful that 
&gt; she was extremely
&gt; careful, god bless 'er.
