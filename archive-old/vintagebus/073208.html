&gt; I've always wondered about putting guages in the

&gt; Can you still use the air vent if you've got the

&gt; do you block it off?  I'm thinking of maybe doing
&gt; this with my bus.  Thanks.

Mmmm, I've seen it done &amp; while it looks trick it
would involve a LOT of fiddling around.
The other thing is that if you block off the vent and
you don't have safaris it can get a little hot in
there.
The vent wings and sliders are well fine and good but
you really need the extra vetilation particularly if
you live in a hot climate.
I live in Australia &amp; I need all the ventilation I can
get for Summer.
Have a look at this set up:

I was thinking on the way home from work that if I
used a sheet of tin &amp; clay to make a model and made a
mould I could probably make an entire fibreglass roof
panel that had an integral pod which would avoid
cutting the fibreboard like the one above has been
done.
Once it was sprayed it would look fine and I could
even get it upholstered.
Just ideas of course.
The above pic should give you an idea of how it would
look.
:o)
Cheers &amp; God Bless
