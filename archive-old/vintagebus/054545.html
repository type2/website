Subject: Re: [VB] transaxle replacement


What's your
&gt; top speed, and what's
&gt; your crusing speed like? 

With my 412 center section, and small-nut RGB's, I can
cruise at 60 easily, and can top out about 70, but I
have a really sweet engine in this bus.  However,
there's nothing fancy in the thing.  I think it's just
naturally well balanced, but it's a stock 1600
singleport.

PS  Ronnie, as usual, was cruising with a large engine
and some kind of exotic gearing, but we were doing
60-70 in the southern California desert.  When we got
to Brawley, it was 107 degrees, and humid.  I had my
safari's open, and couldn't cool myself down, until we
hit the highway (72?) to the coast that comes out at
Escondido.  When we hit the hills, we started cruising
up them, and had a great time!  Ronnie still says that
it was the best caravan that he's ever been on, and he
hates caravans because most people won't go fast.  I
figure, carry a AAA card, and enough money/credit to
buy another engine.  This IS a hobby, right?
