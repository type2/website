&gt; Hi Guys,
&gt; 
&gt; My clutch has been slipping on occasion and the TOB used to chirp quite
&gt; badly...funny thing is, now that I ordered the replacement parts, the single
&gt; cab has been running 100%, no chirping-no slippage? Weird, but I believe I
&gt; should replace the clutch and main seal before I have more problems.
&gt; I ordered a 180mm clutch kit and engine main seal. My engine is a 1600cc 6
&gt; volt electrical, so I hope the 180mm is correct? Anyways, I have never
&gt; replaced either of these parts before and I am looking for some tips to help
&gt; make the job a success.  Thanks for your advise :-)
&gt; 
&gt; -Tom

What year bus is it?
May well have a 200 mm flywheel....
