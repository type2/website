&gt;very slim (so you can turn both nuts against each other), one is angled
&gt;and the other is straight. They are 32mm, which is too big for my axle
&gt;nuts. Does anyone know what they are for?

David,
  That's the size that fits the wheel bearing nuts on my '63. Since '63 was
the last year for several brake and suspension components, I'll hazard that
it fits '63 and down to ? (Clara?)
