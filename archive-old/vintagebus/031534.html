Subject: Re: [VB] Attaching bed slats with screws

This sounds like a pretty good option, as long as these screws are
available in a half-inch length.  Any longer would risk coming up
through the top of the bedslat.

&gt; This does sound like a good idea and I might suggest something that may
&gt; work even better.  Around the rural areas, we are building large metal
&gt; barns that have a wooden frame.  In order to attach the metal to the frame
&gt; we use a hex headed metal screw that has a drill bit tip and on it's head a
&gt; rubber washer.  Using a cordless screw driver, we drive this into the sheet
&gt; metal and they drill their own hole through the metal and into the wood.
&gt; The rubber washer seals the screw (there is a shoulder on the screw head
&gt; that acts as a washer) against the sheet metal.  These screws do have a
&gt; powder coating on them so they won't rust.
&gt; 
&gt; You can find these screws with the self drilling tip and rubber sealing
&gt; washer at most well stocked lumber yards.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;These were actually #12 sheet metal screws with hexhead tops so I could
&gt; &gt;tighten them down (from underneath) with a mini socket wrench.  They
&gt; &gt;held quite well in this wood.  By pre-drilling, I meant that I drilled
&gt; &gt;smaller-diameter guide holes into the undersides of the slats, to
&gt; &gt;prevent splitting the wood with the screws.  Hope that clears things up
&gt; &gt;for you.
