&lt;&lt; I also have a pile of parts that I ordered from CaliforniaImports that I'm
 just too lazy to send back - or rather why bother spending 5 bucks to send
 back a 4 dollar seal.

In my experience, if I sell a part or trade something for it, I need it w/in 
a month or two.  Just hold on to the parts you accidentally order, and you'll 
be able to trade them for what you really need!  I guess I shouldn't have so 
many busses.....
