Subject: RE:[VB] battery explosion and clutch cable breaks 

Hi John,
Can you tell us where the clutch cable broke?  That tells alot.  As for the 
battery exploding, most likely you let the water level in the battery drop 
below the top of the lead plates inside.  Hydrogen and oxygen gases are a by 
product of electricity being taken out or put into the battery.  With the plates 
exposed a spark can happen in the oxygen and hydrogen laden atmosphere and BOOM! 
 Due to this it is a good idea to remove clean cables/terminals and fill the 
battery with distilled water at least every spring and fall about six months 
apart.
