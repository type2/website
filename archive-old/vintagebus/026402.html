&gt; Hey Chris,
&gt;         The real question is:  how original do you want your bus to be.
&gt;  I had to make a decision on the glass for my '61 Westphalia Camper. Do
&gt; I want to maintain large logo Sekurit glass all the way around or? I
&gt; choose to keep all the original style, always looking for better glass
&gt; of the same type at swapmeets, etc. Same thing with my '55 Single Cab.
&gt; Windshields where matching &quot;Delog&quot; stamped panels. There was no way I
&gt; was going to mess that up. They have a few scratches, but so what. I
&gt; would be interested to hear what you finally decide to do.
&gt;                                                                                                                 73,

Apologies to the list. The correct glass on my '61 Westphalia was (is)
Sigla. sorry for the brain lock.
