Subject: Re: [VB] Bus Puzzler - Need Help

This hard-starting relay kit is available at RMMW and is probably in
some of the other better known VW parts catalogs as well.  I used it on
one of my ACVWs with the same symptoms a couple years ago, fixed it
right up.  Two years later the starter motor (original item) finally
gave out anyway.

&gt; &gt; Here's a puzzler that I'm living with right now:
&gt; &gt; '67 deluxe. runs great. starts up just perfectly when cold.
&gt; &gt; ride around for 15-30 minutes, and when I shut the ignition off, it
&gt; &gt; will not restart. no noise, no starter, nothing.
&gt; &gt; battery is fine. lights work.
&gt; &gt; I let the bus sit for 30-45min., try it again, and it starts right up!
