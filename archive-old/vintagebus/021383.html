&lt;&lt; Does anybody know if there is a difference between beetle and bus hitches
made
 by Westfalia? I see an older couple driving around in there 70's bug that is
 equipped with said hitch, and I was wondering if it is worth the trouble of
 even bothering them for it?&gt;&gt;
Well as far as we know Westfalia never made a hitch for the bug.  As for the
bus one it has a round bar running front to rear where it bends upward and
suddenly has a ball on the end.
  
 &lt;&lt;As for lug nuts, the other night I was putting my wheel on and noticed
 something. 4 of the 5 lugs were different slightly, each was hollowed out.
One
 was really hollow, next was a little less hollow, and the same and so on, til
 the last one was solid. Is this the way that VW balanced the wheels? I have
 heard that they are different year lug nuts. Just wanting to know in case
 someone bets me! &gt;&gt;
Different years and you should find all of the same to keep you wheels just
that more balanced.   Eric &amp; Barb
