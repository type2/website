Subject: Re: [VB] 54 Barndoor

THe windows are shorter because it doesn't have the ventilation system,
but it's the same height inside.  In fact, it's even better, as it 
doesn't have the center ventilation console...

&gt; Hi list, nice to have you back. Has anyone else been drooling on that 54
&gt; barndoor advertised on the samba? I have been, any opinions or comments
&gt; would be appreciated ( good deal ? ). Also would being 6'4&quot; be a problem
&gt; as far as being able to look out through the windshield. It's not really
&gt; a problem in my 60's buses but I saw that factoid about barndoor windows
&gt; being shorter and got worried. Is the roof lower too or are the windows
&gt; just shorter? Any tall people out there with barndoors?
