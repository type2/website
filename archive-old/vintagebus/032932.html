Subject: Re: [VB] Door alignment question

&lt;&lt; you can okie adjust 'em by lifting them up hard and (ahem) adjusting. &gt;&gt;

What I've done in the past (and it's whole lot like &quot;(ahem) adjusting&quot;  is to 
put a short piece of 2x2 in the bottom hinge, and gently pressing the door 
towards the bus, trying and trying to get the best alignment, or, 
alternatively, take a pipe wrench on the lower hinge, and (gently) pulling it 
towards the rear of the bus.  It may be kind of like the BFH in other 
European shop manuals, but it works!  (BFH= big f##king hammer).
