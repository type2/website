This is just lighting gel (used for stage lights) I was able to get a free 
set of about 500 colored gels from a music store and would probably be able 
to repair 50 speedy-o-meters with it. Also I've got a friend that works in 
the A/V  business and I should be able to get some large sheets from him 
which I would be willing to cut up (2-3&quot; sq) and send to anyone who wants them.
