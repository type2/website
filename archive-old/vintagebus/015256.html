Subject: Need a Fender?  ***** Oil cooler info
Date: Fri, 18 Feb 2000 11:33:16 PST
Mime-Version: 1.0

Hey everybody:

This is just a shameless reminder that I have a genuine VW of Mexico front 
left fender up for auction real cheap! I know there must be someone out 
there who needs a great quality fender.  Just click on the URL below.

Question.  Does anyone know if adapters are available to fit pipe thread 
fittings to an oil cooler with metric threads?  I am about to get an MG oil 
cooler and I want to us it on my VW.

Thanks,

Skid
