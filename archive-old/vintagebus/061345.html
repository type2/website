Subject: AZ Bus Member in the News! =)

The Arizona Republic newspaper, 08/26/02 (Phoenix,AZ) featured Arizona Bus Club
member, Jim Burnite, who resides in Yuma Arizona. A great article shined the
light in the right direction. 

Jim has been one of the resident saints for many years specifically in regards
to his engine building talents and more generally helps where ever and when
ever he can. For many years Jim has graciously donated his time, talents and
energies in successful completion of the annual Jerome Jamboree raffle bus. Mr.
Burnite is more active in the bus club than most Phoenix local club members
(including myself) even though he lives several hours away. His spirit of
giving, optimism and choice of fine cigars has  ensured the positive perception
of the club, Arizona and the love of VWs in general on many, many occassion. 

If anyone deserves an article he does! He makes us all proud. Thanks to Jim for
all of his participation and generous help.

Come to Jerome Jamboree XII, (Jerome, AZ) on September 14/15, 2002 and
personally congratulate Jim and have a chance at winning one of his engines to
be installed in this year's raffle vehicle. The AZ Bus Club will be raffling
off a single cab truck.

All of us in the AZ Bus Club hope to see you there!!
Congrats and &quot;thanks&quot; Jim. We love you as a brother.
