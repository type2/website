Subject: More carb info for Zorm

Ok guys, here it is.

I looked in my carbs and couldn't see any numbers, but on the outside of
the carbs cast in the metal on the outside of the venturis I saw a 29 in
a circle. This won't mean a thing if someone has changed the venturis,
but I doubt that has been done. These carbs looked like they belonged to
someone who wouldn't even change oil when I got them.

How's Zorm running now? Private update OK.

Later
John
