&gt; *I have some tricky squeaks towards the front of my '60 Dcab. I have
&gt; *completely lubed all zerk fitted points on the beam with the wheels in the
&gt; *air and the noises remain. They are intermitent and I don't seem to be able

Also check the tie rod ends: make sure all the boots are intact and that
there's grease inside them -- you should be able to wiggle the tie rods,
rotating the ball joints in the ends, freely.

When a suspension ball joint (big brother to the tie rod ends) was failing
on my old beetle, the first symptom was a squeak after all the grease got
washed out.  So check 'em anyway since you _really_ don't want a tie
rod end to fail!
