Subject: re: roof hatch

hi

Is there anybody who could give me some advice as to installing a roof
hatch - What type of hinge is required, latches etc... Maybe a couple of
pictures - that would be great.  I guess I could figure out the
dimensions from the brochures on-line but any assistance would be very
much appreciated.

I have serious roof dents on my 59 and a roof hatch would, I think,
solve the majority of my roof problems.

thanks in advance
