I cant say much here anymore, although I still read. I dont own a split 
window bus anymore. That explains why. I just cant seem to leave this list, 
though I should be banished to the bay list. But that place just isnt 
interesting.

I put a 12 volt fan in the bus (yes its a 70) oh well. It sits on the dash 
and blows air either at me or oscilates.
That has nothing to do with anything, but it was fun to put in and nice to 
use. It was an old part from a garage sale.
Target sells a neat little fan as well, cheap, and plugs into the pc term 
power socket (read ciggy lighter).

Anyway, the bus runs well. Things are good.
Whats this got to do with you?
Well lets tell you about this:
I put a porche 914 tach in it for giggles, and checked it with my trusty 
hand held tach. They line up quite nicely. My engine spins up faster then I 
thought it would (or could). Could see that a whomp on the accelerator would 
make it jump way up, hits 5000 before you know it. But found my driving 
habits, even when Im nuts, is within line. My 63 was definatly geared like a 
late model tranny. Almost exactly. 3100 rpm at 60, 3800 at 65.
Also had a temp guage going and driving hard hitting 70-75 for about 15 
minutes I read 210 at most. OK.
Now heres the point if you are still reading:
I then hooked up a brand new VDO tach I borrowed. Was off by several hundred 
  to alomst a thousand rpm. No problem it allows for adjustment. But the 
needle jumped around like crazy, was slow to respond, and really acted like 
a piece of JUNK.
My question is: does vdo not make decent stuff anymore? Thier guages are 
incremented poorly (the oil temp, and pressure), and this kind of responce 
from the tach just sucks.
Dont trust a guage from out of the box, especially vdo.

I liked my 63, I am really beggining to like my 70. (Slept in it for the 
first time a couple of days ago and it was kind of uncomfortable...because 
the foam was stiff from little use!).
