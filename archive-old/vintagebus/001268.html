Subject: Re: [VB] Barndoors &amp; Binz

&gt;I was browsing through Everett's site, the samba_dot_com., and saw some of the pix I had sent him are now available for viewing.  Thanks Everett.  The second oldest Westy known to exist is one of the barndoors. 
&gt;
Ah, yes, a public thanks to Mark Pribanic is in order for that, he sent me 164 photos!  I scanned them all and sent them back.  Anybody is welcome to send more, either scanned or physical photos.

I am working on making them available within the next few weeks.

Regards,
Everett Barnes
