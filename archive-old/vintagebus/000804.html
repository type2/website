&lt;&lt; I know our wiring is a mess, but there's only so many places something can 
go wrong between the headlight and the switch right? &gt;&gt;
Hi Matt,
Right and wiring is probably the problem!

&lt;&lt;The adjustment screws on the rings are at about 10 o'clock and 4 o'clock.  
I'm 
guessing one's for up/down adjustment and the other's for left right 
adjustment.&gt;&gt;
Nope.  One is for left/right down the other is for left/right up.  You will 
have to experiment to figure out the mixture of the two screws to get where 
you want to go.  


&lt;&lt;Tonight when it gets dark I'll pull the bus to the end of the driveway, 
turn on the lights and adjust away.  I'll have to align them using the 
brights since only one low beam works.  Am I high thinking I can properly 
adjust them with just the high beams or is it possible?&gt;&gt;
Not really.  The brights are wider, and should be much higher aimed than the 
lows.  Even when you fix the lows the adjusting is only finished after taking 
a test cruise to make sure they are low enough to light the pavement and 
especially the traffic lines 20-50 feet ahead of you.    Eric&amp;Barb
