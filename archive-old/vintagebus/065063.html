Subject: Re: [VB] new bus, naming it

I bought a bay with the intent of letting it go later
for a profit but have been informed that it is &quot;cute&quot;
and the &quot;interior is in excellent shape&quot; (it really is
, down to the perfect original gray floor) and now she
says it's her bus and we're keeping it! I guess If I
changed the plates, it would be to NOT4ME!
