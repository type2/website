Hey Folks:

I was going through my windshiled glass last night and for the first time realized that I have 3 drivers side pieces of Sigla Glass, but no *useable* passenger side pieces.

Anyone out there have nice passenger side Sigla windshield that they would like to trade for a nice drivers side? (Thurston, your's is going in da bus. :)  )

TIA.

Robert
