Subject: Looking at some busses today

Looked at some busses today::

Went over to Damen's shop today. Took a long look at his 63 that he has made 
into a 61 double door passenger 23 window. It looks really good. I am going 
to ask him if I can take pictures.
He put in new floors, interior, including a cloth headliner. Cutting up a 
bus and putting in double doors is not easy, but it looks great.
His project for another person is painting a 54 single cab truck. He isnt 
too happy about painting this bus as is, he wants it blasted down to metal 
and redoing it, but it will surfice. How many 54 trucks are known to exist?

Ordered pizza and delivered some beer to get my dual carbs gone over. I have 
been running on 2 cylinders it turns out. OUCH. Not always, but sometimes, 
and I really noticed it. Fixing these damn Kadrons is a pain in my side, but 
when they work with the 1776 the bus just rocks. I can watch that spedo go!
I have really entered a weird world where stock just becomes meaningless. I 
was such a die hard stock fan in the past, but now....who knows?
I still argue with these guys over lowering though, I am against it for  a 
bus. But the bugs...........I just dont know anymore....
Jason
