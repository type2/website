Subject: roller bearing cranks

A week or so back I mentioned that a  buddy came across a set of roller 
bearing cranks and rods. The feedback I got was that they were SKG. He 
listed them for sale on the samba and there is a picture there. Was 
wondering if someone could take a look and see if that's what they were or 
not. Here's the link:

I would also be curious about the advantages to using one of these. The 
seem pretty slick. I was told they aren't good for the dragstrip...but are 
nice in a street machine. What's the scoop?
