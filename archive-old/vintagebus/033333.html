Subject: Spotlight Mirror
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

Interested in purchasing a spotlight mirror for the 57 dlx but need to know 
what year this accessory was first introduced.  Anyone have any information 
on this?  Also interested in possibly obtaining late 56/ early 57 BOSCH amber 
fog lamps but ned to know a reasonable price for a set of cherry ones.  Last 
ones that I ran across were well over $300 for the set but that was the 
cheepest I could find. 

Drive your VW!
