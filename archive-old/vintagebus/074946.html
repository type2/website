Subject: And the saga begins

   Today we are cutting out the cargo floors of a 1963-23 window deluxe as
we get it ready for resto. Stripping an old bus down for resto seems to take
forever, but the end results should warrant the time spent doing this.
   The thing that amazes me is the amount of DIRT that accumulates in the
belly pans of one of these buses. I have come to the conclusion that you CAN
NOT restore a belly pan bus with out either , removing the belly pans or the
cargo floor. At least one of these need to be opened up to get all the dirt
out and the dirt gets everywhere, in the top hat sections, jack points,
u-channel etc, a dirty job but someone has to do it.
  Watch for future upfdates and the progress on this bus as we plan on
having it completey done by The Christmas holiday season.

ps, I pick up my newly painted 1960 DC next weekend, it will be really
strange having a totaly rebuilt bus (notice I didn't say restored) as it is
not original color, interior, engine, trans and front end etc. so I choose
to use the term REBUILT as a replacement word for a totaly redone non
original VW
