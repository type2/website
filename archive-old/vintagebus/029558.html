Subject: Ray Hale recovering from accident

Hi folks:

Some of you may know Ray and Leah Hale from Gainesville, FL.  This
morning I learned that Ray and a friend had a motorcycle accident a few
weeks ago; he's recovering at home but has had to bow out of teaching
for a while.  Word is that his friend got a pretty serious leg injury,
but that's all I know.  I'll pass along any word I get on future
developments.  I haven't seen Ray for a couple of years but AFAIK he and
Leah still own that to-die-for single cab and a standard splittie.

If any of you Hogtown-area folks get further word on Ray please let us
know.

joe
