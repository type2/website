I had that problem earlier this year... Could pull TWO spark plug wires off and not affect the idle. The engine had two dual barrel dellortos and at idle would take a gulp of gas and air, leaving none for the the following cyl. At a much faster idle it's hard to tell if it's running on 3 or 4 cyl. Keep tabs of your gas mileage, or put in a cyl head temp guage and move the sender around occasionally if you have dual carbs and want more than 500 miles out of a rebuild due to one lean cyl. 

Towing. Karl towed my '63 DC with his '78 Westy, no major problems. 130 miles, all flat with a tow bar not a dolly. Check the archives for all the warnings &amp; gotchas. Who bounced a bus off a trailer a while back? 

What car did I learn do drive in? Navagation - '58 Plymouth station wagon, engine-clutch-transmission skills in a '49 Fordor. Maintenance and vehicular responsibility - '67 beetle.
