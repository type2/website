Subject: Re: [VB] 70 Westy Camper Manual Supplement (HOST?)

&gt; Just before I sold off my 71 Westy, I scanned in the camper manual supplement... I was wondering if there is
&gt; anyone who would like to host this manual?  
&gt;
A la Keanu Reeves: &quot;Hit me!&quot;

I do have a 1970 Westy manual already on my site, graciously privided by Fred Stoermer, it is visible here:
http://thesamba_dot_com/vw/type2/literature/manuals/manuals70westy.htm
(In the Type 2 -&gt; Literature section)

Perhaps yours is different?

It would be best to use my &quot;Upload&quot; facility on my main page so as not to fill my mailbox.

Anybody else is welcome to upload *anything* Bus related.

Let me know,
Everett
