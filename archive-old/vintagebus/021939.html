&lt;&lt;  I hear about people replacing the standard trannys with later models for 
better freeway use.  Is this necessary?  Can I expect the 67 tranny to have a 
reasonable lifespan with highway driving?  Can it handle speeds of 60-65 MPH 
for long periods of time? &gt;&gt;
Hi DJ,
If you plan to drive long distances on highways the freeway flier is a must.  
It keeps the engine RPMs down, the engine lasts about twice as long due to 
both lower oil temps (Which in turn keeps the oil pressure up during warm 
weather.), and fewer RPMs per mile.  This also increases you MPG at 60-65 MPH 
from 19-20MPG to 23-25MPG which makes big savings over the lifetime of a 
single engine rebuild.  
   We have been running a SP 1641cc engine with the freeway flier tranny, and 
have been very happy with the two in our panel van conversion over the last 
40,000+ miles.  Have just installed another freeway flier in our 1963 SC with 
a big bore 40HP engine in it.  Now that is underpowered!  Will be soon 
building a 1600 for the SC soon so we will see how much differance there is 
between it, and the 1641.  Perhaps having about 56cc more in the 1641 makes 
that big of a differance.  As always HP to wieght ratio is a subjective 
subject.  There are those who will always really require a 1776, 2 liter or 
perhaps V8 power!    

&lt;&lt;Do other early sixties bus owners drive their buses daily?  Do you put tons 
of mileage on them and are they stock or did you modify?  &gt;&gt;
  We only own, and drive air cooled VWs.  Have 110,000 miles driven in the 
SC, and 136,000 miles in our panel.  At first kept totally stock except to 
install big bore 40HP engines, 12 volt systems, and later installed 1964-67 
suspension to stop better in heavy traffic, and steep hills.    Eric&amp;Barb
