Subject: shifter rod2

i just put out a request for a shifter rod that I want to scratch.  i have a
straight style shifter from an early '59.  I used a later model shifter
holder and it was too tall which made the shifter not stay in the cup on the
shifter rod.  Then I used a bug one and it was too short and wouldn't shift.
 Is there a mid sized one for that style shifter or is it the same as the
later models?  i did notice that the throw is shorter on the straight bus
shifter than the curved bus shifter indicating it might be a shorter holder.

Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Doug
