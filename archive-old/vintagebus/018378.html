Someone has an &quot;nos&quot; 36hp case on ebay right now, yet it has the
oil filler thingy attached (the metal part that screws on).  That seems 
highly irregular to me.  I recall another &quot;NOS&quot; cosmolene coated case a 
while back that turned out to be junk.  Seller hasn't responded yet.

BTW, I got in *trouble* with ebay recently; I'd emailed someone
about something they had bid on that was misrepresented, and 
suggested he clarify a couple things with the seller, which I'm
guessing he did, as he retracted his bid.  Seller then bitched to ebay, 
and they bitched at me.

I feel this &quot;cone of silence&quot; policy is wrong.  You can NOT depend
on the seller to always tell the truth about their auctions.  Some
sellers are mis-informed, some ignorant, and some are outright con-men.
According to ebay, I was supposed to email the *seller* and inform
him of the irregularity, at which point he could choose to update
his auction text.  I've done that several times I've done that, and the seller 
seemed glad to have the extra infomation, however only one *one*
occasion was the discrepancy noted.  A few have told me to get bent.

Here's another though you can discuss while sitting around the garage
downing a few cold ones with your buddies and doing an armchair restoration 
on your '51 deluxe with 100 original miles:  Imagine you're at a swap meet.
You're looking thru one of the chickenwire cases at some goodies.  The
guy next to you is negotiating the purchase of some widget.  The buyer
has a $50 bill in his pocket.  The seller says &quot;the price is $20&quot; - 
and you butt in and say &quot;no, the price is $30.  On second thought, how 
about $35.  No, $40.  Ok, now it's $45.&quot;  Then you just walk away, and
the guy now is paying $45 for the item that was originally going to be $20.
Seem far-fetched?  It ain't.  People do it all the time on ebay, when
they see a widget they might liked to have bought, but it's more than
they want to pay.  So out of spite they'll bid it up, literally
taking money out of one guys pocket and putting it in somoene elses,
although a lot of times it's the seller himself working thru another
account.

BTW, it's OK to do this on my auctions :)
