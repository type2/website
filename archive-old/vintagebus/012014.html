Subject: Re: sandblast a bus?
Date: Wed, 4 Nov 1998 09:37:27 -0600

My bus was in fairly good shape, with only one or two spots needing
repair.  I thought when I started I would strip that area and work on
a limited spot.  I went from a spot 12&quot; x 18&quot; to stripping the whole
bus.  This project went from something that would have taken maybe
a month to almost 5 1/2 years.  I haven't driven my bus since October, '93.
And it will be at least 6 months before I'm able to sit behind that big old
steering wheel again.  

Once you begin to sandblast, understand what you are taking on.  Since the
bus
is in bare metal, you realize that you can't just put it back together, you
got to
redo the rubber.  And since you got new paint and rubber, that old
upholstery
just won't do.  And that tired old mill just gotta have 90.5s. And while I
got 
the engine out why don't I give it a little more topend plus stop that
popping
out of fourth gear, I'll just get me a new Transform.

My point, decide where you are going before you start.  Understand that one

thing leads to another.  If you want to look at the bus more than drive the
bus,
then just know that before you start.  Both paths are valid.

When I get finished, I'll be very proud of what I've either done or had
done.  But
again, I haven't driven my bus since October, '93.

Moral:  Be careful what you wish for, you just might get it.

&gt; Since a '67 Westy I'm hoping to buy will need paint, what are your
thoughts
&gt; on prepping for repaint? The original paint is quite faded, but the bus
is
&gt; totally rust-free and dent-free. I want the flat side panels to be as
clean
&gt; as possible. My paint shop recommends sandblasting,
