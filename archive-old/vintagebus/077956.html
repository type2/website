Subject: Gathering my ammo

I saw the post that the archives are up and I haven't been there to look
yet, but I am gathering my ammo because I have picked up my paperwork from
the courthouse to file suit against the mechanics from hell .. I tried to
keep an accurate journal of everything that has gone wrong with my bus, and
the money I spent before waking up and realizing that I was being ripped
off.  I think if I go back and search the archives for ALL my posts, I can
get a better idea of what went wrong with their work, and when [dates] and
the order in which they happened.

I think my VERY FAVORITE rip off by them, due to my ignorance [you would
think I would know more about VW's being I drove them forever] was the bill
I paid for changing my 6 volt electrical system to 12 volt.  I must have
posted that here, or told someone who informed me that my bus CAME with 12
volt, and to be sure, look at the side of the dash .. sure enough .. there
was the 12 volt sticker.

I remembered seeing the 12 volt sticker, questioned it in my mind thinking,
&quot;they wouldn't lie to me about something so obvious, so they must be the
ones who put that sticker there.&quot;

Any way .. glad for the archives because I messed up when installing my new
hard drive and didn't save the folder where I kept my posts to this list.
