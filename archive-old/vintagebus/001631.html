if you go to http://thesamba_dot_com/vw/type2/ and look under
barndoors....Everett has a copy of his letter from Wolfsburg in the section
about his 54 single. His letter lists 8 m-codes for that bus alone. There
were lots of m-codes used through all the years. Its not as simple as &quot;do I
have double doors?&quot; its more like &quot;did I have a special air cleaner?&quot;  &quot;was
I supposed to have the tilt canvas?&quot; ...all used in the process of an
authentic restoration.

Subject: pre 58 M-codes


&gt;In my extensive library I find no mention of M-codes being used in the
&gt;50's. I checked parts amnuals from 54 and 58. They must have had
&gt;something similar of course.
&gt;In any case that list must have been very short.
&gt;Even early 60's M-code lists are very short.
&gt;
&gt;To figure out if you have double cargo doors should not be very
&gt;difficult in any case.
&gt;Same for the color, as there were very few.
&gt;Limited slip differential would be more tricky, same for mountain ratio.
&gt;Those require some crawling.

&gt;PS Anybody know of a pre 58 or pre 60 M-code list?
