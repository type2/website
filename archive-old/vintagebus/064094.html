Subject: RE: [VB] Heat Exchangers

run with all the windows open :-)


Gary asked:
After finding connecting heater tubes-from the 'heater mufflers' to the body
tube, I was ready for warm air.  Well, I got it, but with an added bonus.
Smelly, exhaust.  I am assuming that there must be exhaust leaks in the heat
exchangers, therefore, they need to be replaced.  Any suggestions on the
best ones to get and from where?  FYI:  The Bus has a '74 Beetle DP motor in
it if that matters.
