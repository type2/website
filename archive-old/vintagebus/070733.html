Subject: Engine compartment insulation

I was hunting for parts the other day for my bus and I saw a bay window bus
with some kind of silvery insulation on the ceiling of the engine
compartment.

Was this stock or something the owner added? I thought it might be a good idea
to insulate my engine compartment while I had the engine out. Does anyone have
any opinions on this?
