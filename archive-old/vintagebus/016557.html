Have no fear, I was kidding to get a response. I'd
love to have a Volvo wagon!
My reputation is that of a &quot;wiseguy&quot; or worse. Dont
worry, I dont have any teeth. What I wrote is commonly
refered to as flamebait. A message written to evoke a
pointed response. Thank you *so much* for giving the
expected reaction. Actually, I was thinking of another
Volvo driver that several of us know. ;-) It's an
inside joke and a subtle slam that should go without
discussion. =)
To narc on myself I will actually for the first time
in ten years be dragging the '54 barnambulator over
behind a Jeep Cherokee perched on a lowboy trailer.
Flame me right back but I jumped at the oppty to be
able to work all day Friday and still run across the
desert in A/C comfort. My goal for the OCTO weekend is
different than most years. Will be flying solo, trying
to sell a vehicle and get back to work ASAP. Most
years I have time and money for a vacation. Not this
year.
I did the *12 hour* trip from Phoenix to the OCTO last
year in the 36hp barndoor. I could not bring myself to
haul a 5 month baby and nursing wife with me in a 46
year old bus, stopping to feed every two hours for an
hour each time. Add that to last year's 12 hours and I
would have to start out today to get there in time.
&lt;not!&gt;  This year I will blast over in about 5 hours
and &quot;allow&quot; Momma and daughter to stay at home.
