Are the '69 tanks taller than a '67?  We've had our '67 for 2 years and who
knows how long before the PO drove it without a gasket in the cap, but there
are no signs of spillage.
Also, the venting doesn't have to be thru the cap. A fitting in the fill hose

with a hose way up high tied to a fitting in the gas cap area with some sort
of end fitting would be another way to prevent spillage, but not very &quot;stock&quot;

looking. The cap sits almost horizontal so a hole in any position, or in one
of the 2 positions 180 deg apart depending how the cap went on, probably will

not matter much.
