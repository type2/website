&gt;I am considering a bus for sale, I think a '66, where the owner describes a
&gt;serious shimmy.  Here are his exact words:
&gt;
&gt;  &quot;The main problem is that at about 30mph it shimmys a lot. I've checked
&gt;tie rods etc., and adjusted the steering gear. No go. I think the steering
&gt;gear might be bad.&quot;

Stephen,

If it's Front End (not steering gear box):

Could be that the tie rods are improperly adjusted, putting the vehicle way out of alignment. You can check this with a tape measure by pointing the wheels straight and then measuring from rim-to-rim at the back of the wheels and then rim-to-rim at the front of the wheels. The distance should be the same for both, making the front tires *both* point straight when you point them straight--you may also be able to simply *see* these are off by pointing the wheels straight and walking out in front of the bus to eyeball them. If you do the measure thing, lay under the bus and measure *at the rim*; tires will often have bulges that distort the measurement.

If the tie rods are bad, you'll see slop in them as you lay under the bus and someone else turns the steering wheel back and forth.

I'd also check bearings, though doubtful. Grab tire at top and pull/push, looking for slop. If you see much at all, either the bearing is bad, or the nut on the stub axle is backed out too far; possibly stripped? Pull off grease cap from the outside of the wheel to check--use the back end of a claw hammer to carefully pry off, but on the driver's side, first pull the cotter pin from the steering cable and push it into the cap before removing grease cap. Bearings are easy to replace; stub axles are hard.

The front end as a unit can be had for about $100-150 from a junkyard. Another $100 for all new tie rods and shocks; another $35 for bearings, if needed. Once you figure a good way to support the front of the bus, you can remove the front end yourself...might need a friend to help lift it; definitely will need one to help put it back in. I've removed front assy's myself, without help. The trick is to &quot;break loose&quot; the nuts before supporting the front end and then be very safe, so the front of the bus doesn't come tumbling down on you.

If I found a bus with a bad steering/front end assy, I'd plan on spending $200, but I wouldn't fear that bus.

If it's steeing gear box:

The hardest part, IMHO, is removing the steering wheel itself and finding a good place to remove the steering gear. On early buses (up to '67), the steering gear and the arm going up to the steering wheel are one assembly. They pull down, out of the bus, but you almost need one of those &quot;pits&quot; to pull one out into...or you need to jack the bus up about 4 feet off the ground (safely).

I don't know about rebuilding those gear boxes or adjusting them, so listen for someone else to answer about that.

I think you can get a good steering box for $75-150 used...maybe $200 &quot;rebuilt.&quot;

Thanks! Joe
