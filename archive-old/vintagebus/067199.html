I'm glad I'm not the only one &quot;old enough.&quot;

One tip.  Mark the notch on the pulley with something reflective.  A
good temporary mark is chalk.  A dab of white or silver paint would help
long term.  What little light comes out of those old timing guns can be
seen much better when it has something to reflect.
