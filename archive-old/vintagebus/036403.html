You can get a set of awesome reproduction round mirrors and arms for
IZZ's. I have an old card but the number is 408.926.4112. I just got
some mirror arms from them and they are awesome. The mirrors are even
better. They even have the VW stamp on them (I don't know how they are
getting away with that one). The only complaint is they are nicer than
stock. They are a beautiful polished stainless steal that I don't think
I can bring myself to paint. I have no affiliation with them I am just
really impressed. (I am also tired of replacing crappy repop parts,
like axle boots every year. I swear they used to last at least 5
years.) My WCM headlights seals cracked after one year and split the
next. I don't care about a lifetime guarranty. When I go to restore my
23 Window the last thing I want to do is to pull all my windows again
just to get my lifetime warranty.
