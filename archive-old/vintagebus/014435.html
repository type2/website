Hi Volks!

&gt; uncontrolled intersection and got hit just behind the driver's door.
&gt;  The cops say they expect my bus will be written off.  Damn.  I
&gt; don't remember a thing until waking up in hospital Sunday morning. 

Diana, I feel with you.  However, count yourself lucky to be alive 
and (as it seems) relatively unharmed.  Did you seek medical 
assistance?  If not, by all means do so ASAP!  And as for the bus, 
well, take the money and take your time to find a better one... as I 
don't think you'll be tempted to get a Toyota ;-)  I hope that when 
you've found the right bus for you, you'll look back on your accident 
as not entirely a bad thing after all.  

And of course, that your next bus won't have seen nor continue to see 
so much abuse either ;-)

Good luck, and may the busma be with you!
    Erik.
