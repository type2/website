Subject: Re: [VB] (Friday) Don't forget... Was Header woes

After my engine rebuild I put everything together, tightened everything,
hooked everythig, checked, doublechecked and got in and tried to start it
but...I forgot to put any oil in.

It only took three revs to know something was wrong.

&gt; Back when I was new to VW's and did not have much mechanical smarts, I
&gt; tightened my flywheel on to what felt tight to me.
&gt; I used a 1/2 drive ratchet that was about 12&quot; long.  Needless to say the
bus
&gt; made it about 4-5 blocks before the flywheel spun off and ruined my crank
&gt; and alot of other stuff...oh yeah, it was an engine i just bought and had
&gt; less than 10 miles on it.  After having it rebuilt again, everything works
&gt; fine and I don't work on my engine too much anymore.
