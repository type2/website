&lt;&lt; On the 66 SC that I got last week it has no washer stuff at all.  No =
 bottle, hoses,  or even the little sprayer heads that go on the front of =
 the bus.  Anybody have any of this?  I know the bottles are hard to come =
 by and I really don't need it but would be nice to get it all back!  At =
 least the sprayer so I can fill the holes that weather is going to =
 inside through &gt;&gt;

I think that the winsheild washer bottle is dumb and didn't put on ein my bus 
even when I had it. (the bottle, not the bus).  Takes up valuable junkspace 
on the dash tray. but the hole- yes needs plugging.  do use a rubber grommet 
(make yer own from a piece of flat rubber) for install of the squirters.

come to think of it, they were not standard on 63s, so you may have had 
aftermarket/home grown set up.  Anyhow, they were changed- i think for the 66 
model year, definately the 67 has a differnt kind than 65.
