Subject: Re: [VB] re:overheating

Removing engine tin is not &quot;conventional&quot; wisdom.  People always ask if 
all the cooling tin is in place.  

When we speak of a vacuum inside the engine bay, has anyone measured this 
the pressure difference --inside-- and outside the engine bay. Agreed, the 
cooling fan won't be pushing any air at all in a complete vacuum, but also 
the engine would have a bit of trouble running?
