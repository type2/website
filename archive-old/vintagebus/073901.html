Subject: HELLLLLLP!!!! A quick answer would make us happy.

We've been trying for an hour to pull a tranny out of a '78 bus.  We followed 
the Bently procedure and removed the square head screw from the shift rod.  
Why won't the shift break free of the input shaft of the transmission?  It 
appears that there may be some rust where the two units join. We've used PB 
blaster and a hammer but can't get them apart. The tranny is level and lined up 
(again).

Advice needed!

Jacques and Terry
