Actually I only assumed there was one and since I haven't looked under
the pedal pan I wasn't sure since I did not see it in the usuall spot.

It's a 53

&gt; Cory, what year is your bus?   I believe steering dampers were not normal
&gt; equipment on barndoors.  They were, however, an option, and VW sold parts to
&gt; retrofit one on your barndoor. if you have one, would you please take pics, I
&gt; would loveto see it.
&gt;

&gt; 
&gt;  Anyway can someone tell me if Barndoor steering dampners are the same as
&gt;  later models. My front end and steering wheel shakes violently when
&gt;  hitting certain types of bumps.
