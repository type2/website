&gt; I'm not sure if it was mentioned, but there is a BD on ebay right now.  I
&gt; know how some of you de-test (sp?) the site, but want a  BD.  It was at $2175
&gt; when I last looked.  The seller mentioned it had been up previously but the
&gt; seller backed out.  Anyone know what the selling price was last go around?
&gt; Anyone see it personally?
&gt;

I was going to bid on it originally, but I never could get the &quot;owner&quot; to send me
any other info or pictures other than what's in the ad. Did anyone else have
luck? Thom??

Originally it &quot;sold&quot; for $5250.00
