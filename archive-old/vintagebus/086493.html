Subject: Re: [VB] Lower left control on speedo pod?

Ahh, ok. I'll save the switch, then. It this case, it was wired directly
to the ignition coil. It provided +6V. I pulled that junk out, and put
back on the original green (blue?) wire.

One (or several) POs have done some really dumb (and sad) things to this
bus. There still is a bit of work on the wiring, but at least everything
works, and it start reliably. I just needed to make it start and run good,
since I need to move it around under it's own power.
