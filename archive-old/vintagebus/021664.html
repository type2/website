OK, I think I've sent this message to the lists only, if not, please forgive 
my intrusion. Jonn and I will be gone until next Thursday, January the 27th. 
    I work for a dentist part time, and since we met our production goals for 
last year, he gets to pay airfare and hotel for all of his staff to go to 
Puerto Vallarta for a week. WOOHOO!
    We will still have someone here in the office filtering list mail, so we 
won't be signing off. 
    So we just wanted to let you know in case you email and wonder why you 
don't get a quick response.
Jenn &amp; Jonn Flores
Soon to be two of only 12 people in Washington state with a real sun made 
tan!!
