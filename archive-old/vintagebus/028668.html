  Well Paul, since you know what is best for everyone 
else, maybe you should run for congress...you would fit 
right in!
 Either that or try to get on some unelected state 
bureaucracy like CARB with the other do-
gooder/safetycrats who know what's best for you and I. 
They believe they have a noble cause too...crushing 
buses because they want to get those unsafe, cold, 
noisy, polluting, clunkers off the road and &quot;to 
encourage more sensible, fuel efficient vehicles.&quot;

&gt;I have to agree with your criticism on SUVs entirely.  
&gt;SUV= Stupid Ugly
&gt;Vehicle.  I perhaps could understand having one if you 
&gt;lived in a remote
&gt;place with substandard roads, but I find that my front 
&gt;wheel drive
&gt;daily-driver will trudge through nearly as much snow as 
&gt;any SUV, and there
&gt;are cars that do what SUVs can do only much more 
&gt;efficently.  (like a Passat
&gt;wagon with 4MOTION)
&gt;
&gt;The average yuppie in the crowded urban neighborhood of 
&gt;Lincoln Park in
&gt;Chicago really needs a 4 wheel drive vehicle in an area 
&gt;where parking is a
&gt;commodity.  Only in America do you find such 
&gt;selfishness and waste of
&gt;resources.  No person who drives an SUV in an urban 
&gt;envirment could have any
&gt;regard for their fellow man or the environment.  This 
&gt;may sound funny coming
&gt;from a conservative Republican type like myself

Perhaps you should reexamine your party affiliation? 
Look into the Socialist party, it fits more in line with 
your views on this...From each according to his means, 
to each according to their needs.
