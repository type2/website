All,

Thom is correct - I have &quot;retired&quot; from the biz.  There was far more demand
for the service I provided than I could handle without extending lead times
more than a couple of weeks.  As you know, German radios were used in cars
other than VWs and those &quot;other car&quot; owners are not as patient as VW people,
so that influenced my decision a lot.  

I sold all my inventory to a fellow VW enthusiast from W. Virginia a couple
of weeks ago.  He intends to possibly pickup where I left off, so there may
be someone to carry the torch in the future.

Brad
