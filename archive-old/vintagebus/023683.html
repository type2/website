Subject: 67 chassis number

Hello,

I acquired a 67 bus (well, the title says 66, but everthing else looks
67).  Anyway, the chassis number (on the fresh air vent and in the
engine bay) says it's number 257076396.  I have yet to find a book where
this number range even exists.

Any help on this would be cool.

Thanks,
Darin
