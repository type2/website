Hi there,

I'm preparing to get the BBTA#16 event flyers ready for the US Postal
Service, and for those already on my event mailing list, I'd like to verify
that I have your correct mailing address (some of you move around a bit). 
If you have moved within the last year and if you are thinking about, or
are planning to come to BBTA#16 and need an event flyer, please reply to
&quot;BussesByTheArch_at_compuserve_dot_com&quot;   (not to the various Bus Lists!) with
your full postal mailing address so that I can update the list and send you
the event info.  We hope to see you in very early Sept. at BBTA#16!  Could
someone who is on them, please forward this message to the Type 2 List and
the Vanagon List?  Thank you!
