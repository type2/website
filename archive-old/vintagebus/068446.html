&gt;  &gt; Get off the pavement and they're god-awful.  Sand, grass, mud...

&gt;Oddly, I didn't find this.  They have no &quot;tooth&quot; in loose conditions which
&gt;means that they won't dig a hole when they spin.  For someone with a &quot;keep
&gt;it rolling&quot; technique in loose stuff they work well on an underpowered
&gt;vehicle like a bus.


same here - in the panhandle desert i went thru several sand pits in 
caprock canyon, and it steered like a ship  :) never slid, never 
bogged down.

course, i didn't STOP there, so i don't know how good they are at 
getting OUT of the sand.
