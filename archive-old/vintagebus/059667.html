Subject: Re: Welding on Engine blocks


	I have seen people weld on engine cases for filling behind
cylinder 3 for large cc engine builds but has anyone welded a crack that
has started over 3? I am asking because I have a good running 1600dp
with a crack in the case and I am wondering if it can be fixed that way.
If so I have a mig welder with aluminum wire I would like to try. If it
doesn't work the case is already gone. Any thoughts
