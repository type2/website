I'd like to add that I have found heating the surface alone to work when
shrinking, but I have found that applying the heat to a smaller area and
then placing a dolly behind it and striking it with a body hammer does
even better.  Use caution and start SMALL.  It can get away from you and
create a whole mess of warping.  A real PITA.
