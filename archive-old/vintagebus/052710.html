 I got in my '63 crewcab this afternoon, turned the
 key. After about 1 or 2 revolutions, while clutch was
 depressed, the truck just lurched forward all the
 sudden-like like the clutch was not depressed. I then,
 ever-so-gently limped it to a friend of mine's filling
 station and put it on the rack thinking it was
 probably a broken clutch cable. NOPE. Cable is fine.
 Lots of icky, greasy crap oozing from the nose cone. I
 suppose something internal has broken.
...................
sounds like a sticky clutch to me actually.   If it was my truck I'd pull the 
motor, check the clutch (check pressure part of clutch too- place on floor, 
stand on it and bounce up and down to make sure it springs correctly), and 
see if it is the main seal or tranny shaft seal that is leaking.  
you can pull the tranny tooo and replae the nose cone seal, but the truth is 
that on at least 95% of the old VWs out there that seal leaks and there is 
ooze and it keeps things from rusting.  You might top up the tranny oil.

//////////////////////////
  Anywho, on to
 my question. It is an IRS tranny that I've been going
 to replace anyway because it leaks so much stuff in my
 garage, or anywhere it's parked for that matter. I
 would like to replace it with a freeway flyer or a
 Type 3 tranny. Are these the same thing or is one
 higher geared than the other. What kind of performace
 should I expect if I do put in a freeway flyer?
.................
freeway flyer you have a 3.88 r&amp;p and keep the RGBox (generally).  stock R&amp;P 
is 4.12 or 4.37.  lower r/p means higher gearing.
type3 tranny means no rgboxes with the swing axle center section.   gearing 
may vary.  the idea is you get higher gearing over all as you don't reduce it 
by 1.39 (little nut) or 1.26 (big nut)
///////////////////////////
I'm
 running a stock 1600 DP with single carb. Will this
 combo be OK in a crewcab with stock 1600 and all that?
..................
My 65 westy has a 3.88 r/p with bus 4th  and 1.26 RGBoxes and 14&quot; rims.  With 
a stock 1600sp it does not have enough get up and go.   Took the motor from 
the westy into the 61 (4.37 r/p 1.26 RG 205/75 15s- early 64 type gearing) 
and plenty get up and go- comfortable cruising at 60mph.   SO geez this has 
been beat to death but I would not do the gearing in my 65 unless you will 
build a bigger motor.

guess you also need to know what gearing you have now if you want to know 
what the changes will be, but I think you have a clutch problem.
//////////////////
 I'm assuming the broken tranny is a type 1 but not fo
 sho. Please respond if you can help answer my
 questions. I'll be checking in tomorrow for any
 answers that may fly my way. Thanks everybody!! Happy
 Holidays!!

 '63 Crewcab - Buck
 
 p.s. I'm having to drive my Type 3 while Buck is
 broken. YUK ! (But could be worse!)   ;o) &gt;&gt;
