Hey...!

I saw that record player!   I don't have the fundage for groovy (pun?) stuff
yet...missed you though, Thom, and others...  (I did look)

Got my rear bumper (with overriders &amp; splashpans) and a couple aftermarket
elephant ears.

I agree....much craziness went down today!

I go now to rest my aching head....

Gene
