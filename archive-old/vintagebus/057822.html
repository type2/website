Subject: Re: [VB] byob/red barn &amp; kelley park (long)

&gt; IS this guy reproducing hoops and bows or just canvas? Do you know how to
&gt; conact him? I need hoops, bows and canvas for my DC.

He is just doing the canvas. It's nice, and works, but it's not 100% original
looking. Wrong hardware, wrong colored grommets, and the wrong colored canvas.
But for $500 they be good to &quot;use&quot; If I was going to spend the money I'd buy one
from Dawn at PLF for a little more that was correct.
