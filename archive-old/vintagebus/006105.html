Got the bus running today.  Yay!!!!  Sat behind it and played with the
throttle for about 15 minutes or so.  Sounded pretty good.  Oil temp. came
up to about 180, then I shut it down.  Tomorrow I'll adjust the valves again
and take it for a little test drive.

Thank you so much to everybody who helped out with advice, little springs,
etc.  Looks like I'll be able to make it to the Puyallup meet after all (has
anybody posted details about that yet??

Diana
