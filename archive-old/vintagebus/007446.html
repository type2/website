Oh trusted listees, can any of you tell me about the extra louvers on this
truck?

I found it in upstate NY yesterday. All the usual rot plus the frame had
been sectioned at some time (poor job). The main bed is good and that is
about it other than the little bits and pieces that you could part out.
Definitely not worth the $1500.00 asking price even though it has a running
1600 dp in it.

I wanted to place it in the registry but the photo of the M-Code plate did
not come out and I didn't write it down. I'll be going that way again this
weekend and try to get the numbers again.
