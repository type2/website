Subject: Bus trip to the races

Howdy all,

Just finished reading Ronnie's adventures to OCTO, so I thought I would
chime in on this past weekend for me here in Texas.  My son and I decided
Saturday morning that we should take my '66 Deluxe up to Ft Worth for the
Indy Car race at Texas Motor Speedway. This would be the initial long
distance trip for the Bus.  I was so pumped for the adventure as was Jake.

We took out the middle seat loaded up sleeping bags and foam pads for the
floor, a quick stop at the grocery for the food only a Dad and son could get
away with, and we headed north from Austin.  The trip is usually about 3
hours up I-35, to I 35W which takes you to Ft Worth and right to the track.
About 30 miles out, as we were being passed by everything imaginable, we
found a US Army convoy that was running about 50-55mph, so, I told my son,
we just joined the Army, and traveled with them until they turned off at Ft
Hood.  One fuel stop after about 2 hours cruising and everything looked and
was running great.  I was so excited about the Bus running strong.  It has a
1600DP that the PO had installed and a stock tranny.  The trip took just
over 4 hours and was just a wonderful day for us.  The weather was perfect,
80degrees, calm winds, clear and perfect.  We got to the track with out a
hitch.  After just hanging out in the parking area and enjoying the souvenir
midway we were ready for some really fast and amazing Indy Car
racing.(congrats to Al Unser Jr for his awesome victory.  These cars and
drivers are amazing, 220mph, nose to tail, side by side, edge of your seat
fun.  After the race we headed back to the Bus for sleep.

Great, it's cooling off, a bit of a breeze and off we dozed.....until around
2:30am or so, when all heck broke loose...it's so true, if you don't like
the weather in North Texas wait 5 minutes, the wind was blowing, the Bus was
rocking and with no radio, I had no idea what we were in, but it was bad, so
we headed south.  When you have a 7 year old telling daddy he's scared, you
gotta do what you gotta do, so we did.  No problems, until around 4 the
weather just turned horrible, wind, rain and then wipers went on the
blink....the first and only  mechanical issue we had. So it was pull over
into the Whataburger parking lot and sleep thru this one.

We did and then enjoyed a nice 20-25 mph tailwind all the way home once
daybreak happened.

It was just an awesome getaway and is the reason I have wanted a Bus for so
long.  

Thanks for the forum to relive it.
