I have the IRS rear set-up with a 901 (read EARLY) Porsche 5 speed and
2.0
flat 6 motor.  The rear end is basically bug trailing arms, modified
spring
plates, and bug stub axles (with Porsche flanges).

I have seen a few of these before and people take different approaches. 
The
first is mine, where they moved the trans as far forward as possible,
without
mods to the torsion housing.  Although this is the easiest set-up, the
fan
belt ends up being flush with the rear of the car, and I mean flush! 
The
decklid was modified, cut reversed inside-out, and welded back together.
This also made it impossible to run the stock 911 muffler.  I use 914/6
headers and a custom muffler set-up.

The second set-up I saw this and last year at the VW Classic.  They
actually
moved the torsion housing forward.  this requires special spring plates,
but
does allow the stock muffler and un-modified decklid.

The third set-up I saw was on a bay window,, which is cheating since
they
have a larger engine compartment.  They used the stock trans and a 911
motor,
which just barely fits.
