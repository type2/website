Subject: Tie Rod Solution

Thanks to David and a little research, here is the proper (and easy) answer.

The right side is a complete tie rod assembly that is factory pressed.  So 
the complete old assembly is a throw away.

211-415-802D Tie Rod, Non-Adjustable Ends, Right Side March 1955 to 1967

Parts exchange time!

Thanks,
Adrian Pillow
