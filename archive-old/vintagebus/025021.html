&gt; Do any of you out there have a plan or failing that some advice on

Michael,

First off, my condolences on the double cab metalwork.  It has to get
better.

In making my engine stand,
I first got one of those inexpensive engine stands that are on the market
now. I
paid $25 and I have seen them up to $60.  They have a flange that all the
engine
mounting metal attach to.  The flange is welded to a piece of what looks
like 2&quot;
pipe and that pipe sits into the engine stand upright so that you can rotate
the
engine.  This feature is nice when assembling an engine.

I got a bell housing from a later bus and it just unbolts from the transaxle

with about 10 or so bolts.  I got a piece of 1/4&quot; steel and cut it so that
the
steel cleared the starter.  I then welded the steel to the flange.  I then
drilled out the  steel so that the holes matched the bellhousing.  A number
of
bolts and nuts and lockwashers and the stand was ready to go.

Attach your chassis ground cable from the battery to one of the bolts that
holds
the bellhousing to the flange for best operation.

If you do not want to invest in a stand, you can bolt the bell housing and
run the engine on the FLOOR.  I can see an engine running on a bench and
vibrating itself around and possibly onto the floor. There is a company that
sells a corner of a transmission that you can bolt up to back of the engine
and it provides the holes for the starter.

You can get the bell housings at a junk yard.

Scott
