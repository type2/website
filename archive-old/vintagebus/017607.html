My main man, Everett Barnes asked:
&quot;how do you spend $15k on paint and wood resto when
there was no rust?&quot;{

ellis sez:
I personally love to see this ad. I think people ought
to switch from those stupid old deluxes to campers. I
hear that campers and anything camping are *way* more
valuable and useful than those goofy old buses that
let all of the light and air inside. Campers are tres
chic! I hear that their value has just jumped about
30%. They ought to sell like hotcakes to the folks who
really know an oncoming trend.
