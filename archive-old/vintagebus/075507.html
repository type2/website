Subject: Re: 1800 Dyno with duel 34 solex

&gt;
&gt;Last night we dynoed another 1800 (74X88cut ins) using the new CB Solex
&gt;34 pdsit duel carb set up to see what it does and to compare to a like
&gt;engine dynoed with Kaduds, here are the results
&gt;
&gt;rpm   lb-ft   hp
&gt;2500  100.83  48
&gt;3000  100.83  57.6
&gt;3500   96.63  64.4
&gt;4000   91.38  69.6
&gt;4500   82.98  71.1
&gt;5000   76.67  73
&gt;
&gt;[...] This engine was dynoed under less then perfect temps and humidity
&gt;the corrected hp at 5000 rpm's 88 hp
&gt;the corrected torgue at 3000 rpm is 111.64 ft lbs torque

Maybe I don't understand dynos, but the correction factors used seem kind
of high - (88/73) or 1.205 for the hp and (111.64/100.83) or 1.107 for the
torque.  The '50-'62 Bentley has a dyno correction formula for horsepower
on page M-11 2; the correction factor is based on temperature and pressure:
to correct for 20 C (68 F) and 760 mm Hg (29.92 in Hg), the factor is
(760 / pressure) * sqrt((273 + temp)/293) .  Googling around shows that
there are varying SAE standards for dyno correction, including J607
(29.92 in Hg, 60 F), J1349, and J1985 (29.53 in Hg, 77 F, 1% humidity),
but doesn't give the formulae.

The National Weather Service says the high in Havasu yesterday was 109 F
(42.8 C), and the barometer at Bullhead City at 2 pm today was 29.69 in Hg
(754.1 mm Hg) and falling (it was 29.70 in Hg (754.4 mm Hg) at 1 pm).
Plugging 42.8 C and 29.69 in Hg into the formula yields a horsepower
correction factor of 1.046 .  Even if the pressure was lower yesterday,
it'd have to be down to 25.77 in Hg (654.5 mm Hg) at 109 F to get a 1.205
correction factor for the horsepower.  Given that the lowest pressure ever
recorded was 25.69 in Hg (652.6 mm Hg) during a typhoon in the Phillipines
in 1979 (per the UK Met Office), I don't think the pressure in Havasu was
that low yesterday.  :)

If you're comparing two engines, or modifications to one engine, on this
same dyno with the same correction factors, everything is fine - the
numbers can tell you the relative difference (10% more power or whatever)
between the two cases.  But if you're trying to compare these numbers
to stock numbers or numbers that were obtained on some other dyno with
different correction factors, then I think you'll go wrong.  (Having
said that, the stock 1971 Type 4/1700 was 85 hp at 5000 rpm and 99.5
lb ft at 3500 rpm, per &quot;Without Guesswork&quot;.)

There are some interesting articles about dynos here
