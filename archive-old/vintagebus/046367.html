&lt;&lt; my Feb. 23rd '62 crew cab has the gate bumpers and the lower body bumpers 
at
 the rear.  Only gate bumpers on the tale gate.  &gt;&gt;

Hi Volks,
Our 63Sc built 10DEC62 with USA bumpers is the same.  The rubber bumpers on 
the side gates are 13/16&quot; long and the rear gate and lower body ones are 1&quot; 
long.  These are probably the original ones from the factory and certainly 
have shrunk slightly due to years in New Mexico and cental Texas before we 
got it.  The other 63 SC we resucued out of Montana is missing it's tailgate. 
 The side gate rubber bumpers are 7/8&quot; long and the body ones 1-1/16&quot; long 
and both are in much better shape than our first 63 SC.  Eric&amp;Barb
