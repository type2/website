For what it is worth John got the sunroof section and the BD roof clip from 
me.  The sunroof came off a deluxe that was rusted a foot above the rockers 
and had almost no floor.  NQ and Lafoon can vouch for that.  The BD clip came 
of a picked over salvage yard bus with virtually no nose due to rust and a 
diamond plate cargo floor. 

John's previous two finished projects, '56 Oval &amp; a '59 Single cab, were both 
HVW's cover cars...he don't make junk.  He bought the '59 single cab from me 
too.  Many would have passed on restoring it due to the amount of rust.  
Instead John made it a sweet truck.  Custom may not be your thing but if it 
is, Johns the man.
