 Hi Nicholas,
 Definitely, or at least if your 009 wieghts have not been oiled at least 
once 
 every 3,000 miles they could be stuck and not allowing the distributor to 
 advance properly.  If you still think you are sucking air, check your seals 
 of the intake manifold, and for any holes in the manifold itself.  Eric&amp;Barb

re: dist maintanance- do put a drop of oil on the dist wick (under where the 
rotor sits) and a dab of thick grease on the canm every tune up.   I guess I 
had forgotten the grease on the cam of my 61, as it had an awful squeak that 
started recently and was completely cured Sunday by greasing the cam.   this 
can mush the bit of the points that rides on the cam if left too long, so if 
you have this problem inspect that part of the points and re-gap them.
