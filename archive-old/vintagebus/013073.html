Does anyone have a '66 title and tags for sale? Its for a panel van, so that 
would be my first choice.

My problem is that I was screwed out of the correct title from Colin in 
Fayetville NC and Earl in Greenville NC. They also have sofar screwed me out 
of some good rear corners that they promised me.

I've been in contact with the NC DMV and they have been VERY nice, but  come 
to find out, the van was not last registered in NC. After fighting for a few 
months, I would like to atleast get it titled, but continue to see if I can 
find the correct place of last usage.

I really hate doing this, but i also hate seeing the van just set. I do take 
it places, but I have to dolly it.

Anyone able to help me ?

Thanks,
David
