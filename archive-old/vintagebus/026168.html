Regarding the sticky rubber seal on the door/body that Ken mentioned , I
have had luck lubing rubber parts such as wire boots and rubber plugs
with silicone spray lubricant. ArmorAll might work,too. Another powder
solution might be one that is not hydroscopic such as graphite or mica
powder (available at an art supply house as pearlescent powdered
pigment). I did have to trim my replacement seal slightly with a sharp
blade as I recall, and that helped a bit,too.
