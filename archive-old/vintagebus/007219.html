This past weekend I got a couple of important steps completed with the
engine.  I took all my rotating parts (which I listed previously) to
Charley's Speed and Machine in Blair, NE and got to do the trip in my
brother's cherry 68 2 door Chevy Impala (I rolled the mileage over to 44,000
miles during the drip - original too!)  The deal was that I check the
fluids, return the car with a full tank of gas (and in one piece), and
everything would be cool.  Plus, the car has never seen the highway since he
bought it so the cobs got blowed out!  Man that car has got 'road
authority!'  I think the best part of the trip was where I'm cruising down
the highway at 75 when all of a sudden, semi trucks start pulling over in
the right lane and slowing down and why?  All because a state patrolman
happened to be doing a 68 to 70 and nobody wanted to pass.  I just kept the
pedal down, heard the exhaust rattle off the side of his patrol car as I
went by, and I had the Interstate to myself for about 5 miles until the
first wave of 'brave' souls managed to catch up to me.  I figured if I was
really doing something wrong, he could pull me over but chances are he
wouldn't because #1) I was fully legal and #2) it would appear as if I was
pulled over just because I passed him.

Anyway, back to the Blair trip - I wasn't there long at the shop - only long
enough to get asked where the pulley was.  Well of course, they didn't tell
me to bring it, and I failed to remember the post on the list about taking
it so today it will get UPS'd to them.

I tried calling listee Rob Laffoon and Terry Wolfe while I was in Blair but
due to the private pay phones in the area, you're pretty much screwed when
you try to use a calling card or even operator assistance for that matter.
I did get in touch with Rob once I was in Lincoln and using the good
payphones and we had a real nice chat for 30 minutes or so.  Rob is awesome
and I'm really looking forward to hanging out with him, Terry Wolfe, Zac
Robbins and the gang at the upcoming shows.  The Omaha VW crowd by and large
are some of the BEST VW people in eastern NE.

Rob and I said our good-byes and I went to Sears to get my torque wrench
checked out.  The kid I talked to said, &quot;Check them?  I rebuild them...&quot;  I
replied with, &quot;Then how do you check them to make sure they're working
properly?&quot;  He got on the intercom and was told, &quot;They'd have to send it
in.&quot;  Well screw that - I've had this wrench for over 4 years and have
always babied it in the precise ways my grandfather taught me so I'm not too
worried.

The next stop was the eye-glass place that couldn't do a darn thing for me
about my 1.5 year old glasses which managed to break completely yesterday
(the day after) and are now setting out on the bench with a spring encrusted
with JBWeld in hopes of a partial repair.  The gal even had the nerve to
tell me that the glasses with a double cross bar aren't any stronger than
the single.  So here I sit, with my 5 year old previous pair of glasses
(with double cross bar!) with the broken nose pad and a bandana tied to the
middle and lopped over my head in order to keep the glasses suspended off my
nose so I don't rub my skin raw.  Yeah, it's a sight to behold... :-)  The
trip home went real well - the Impala kicked major rear-end on the highway.
Once I got home, a whole 'nother drama unfolded which basically ruined all
the good things that happened throughout the day.  I ended up walking home
about 2.5 to 3 miles at 10:30 at night down some real dark streets and alley
ways.  I had my knife clutched in some kind of a translike death grip but
managed to get home in about 30 minutes.

Yesterday I drove up to Lincoln and dropped off the heads at my machinists
house.  He's a really cool guy and for the first time, I met his wife.
They're both great people and I'm glad to have made their acquaintence.  I'm
kind of with-holding their names for now because they are on this list but
in lurk mode.  I want them to have the fun of delurking and introducing
themselves.  I can tell you this though - he's gotten ahold of  an old 36
horser so you old timers may need to come forth and help my buddy out once
he delurks.

That's basically the story - this will probably be my last week of free time
because once this step is done, it's time to assemble this beast.  Wish me
well...
