For awhile Rubio's had a commercial featuring a 60 panel. The commercial
began with a shot of a taco stand down in Baja (presumably). The panel
shows up (blocking your view of the stand) and when it takes off, the stand
is gone. The idea being that Rubio's is authentic.

The panel was owned at that time by SV2s member Dennis Gault. He has since
sold it and I think, for some reason, that it is in Lancaster, CA.

Right after that commercial, those cups came out. I didn't particularly
think they were very bus looking, so I didn't keep any. It's just a few
brush strokes (or mouse clicks) between a trash can item and an eBay item I
guess! :)

&gt;So some unknown reason, I had lunch at a Rubio's Baja Grill (aka a
&gt;fish taco place) a while back and got a large drink.
