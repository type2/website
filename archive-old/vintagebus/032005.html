&lt;&lt; Does the steering wheel need to be tied off to use a tow bar or can/should 
the front wheels be left to turn freely and track on their own? 
 
 thanks

when using a fixed hitch I leave the steering wheel alone, the wheels of the 
bus can then turn to go around corners.  if the bus has really crappy 
steering you can feel it in the towing vehicle.   careful round corners
