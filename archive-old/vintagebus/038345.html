Well since it's Friday and I'm not on the road to NC I just want to say
that I think Todd Hill is a real class act!

Most suppliers are in the mind set of send me your money and good luck
getting your parts or any help afterwards. Not only did Todd recognize that
Scott is a customer he offers help inthe form of a letter and possible
quick delivery of the parts.(transaxel?)

It is fantastic to see suppliers who take an active part in the List and
offer help when possible. Hooray to you Todd. Also, kudos go to Ron Salmon
who is on the list and a helpful contributor.

&gt; &lt;&lt; I got a letter in the mail to day from my city watchdogs and
&gt; it seems that I am in violation of not one but three city sections
&gt; by parking my truck in the driveway.  &gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt; So you are not allowed to have a non-operational vehicle parked
&gt; on private property within your city limits?  Would a letter from
&gt; me stating that you have a transaxle on order for this vehicle
&gt; help in your legal headache?  And do you need me to speed
&gt; up the scheduled delivery of said gearbox?
