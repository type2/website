Subject: Late model gas tank retrofit

I am planning to do the late model gas tank retrofit into my 63. I had a tank from a 76 already on hand but the outlets don't look quite right. On this tank there are two outlets that are positioned tword the bottom right front as looking at the tank with the filler neck to the right. Is the cutout in my 63 going to line up? I've been under the bus lately doing some fuel line replacement and for some reason I remember the cutout being tword the right front of the bus. The &quot;How To&quot; on the VB website doesn't specify what year tanks to use although the swap was done with a tank from a 68 in the article.
