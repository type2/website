hey volks,

about a month ago, i went hog wild and bought a new VWSA turn key 1600dp
from beetlemex for my daily driver '60 bus. the $65 swap meet 1500sp was
getting tired and had low oil pressure. anyway, after much debate and many
erasers, i did it. and here's the skinny. i paid about $1900 for the engine
including shipping here in sw ohio. remember, this was for a turnkey. the
whole thang, throw it in and turn the key. NOT!

let me preface the following by saying i hired about the only local air
cooled guru in my area to help install the engine. so here's what we found:

the first thing we noticed agreed with another list members finding. no
thermostat! not only are there no provisions on the block, but no provisions
at all on the shroud at all. hmmmm.

the second surprise was that the valves weren't assembled. opened the valve
cover and out spewed a bunch o' parts. hmmmmm again.

the next suprise was that it came with an electronic ignition setup. cool me
thinks. but we never could get it running right and ended up yanking it out
and putting a plain jane 009 with a blue coil and a bocar 34pict carb. it
came with a strange bocar carb with a lot of vacuum ports we couldn't find a
use for. the electric ignition setup does look cool. vw emblems on
everything :-)

miguel from beetlemex (very nice and helpful guy) told us that the turn keys
were intended for fuel injection and mebbe this was the cause for our probs.
anyway, the engine's in and running ok. the top end feels great but it seems
to lack the ooomph i thought it would have on hills and such. i dunno, never
had a new engine before. maybe it'll be better after break in?

also, there is a strange &quot;popping&quot; sound coming from the tailpipe that
sounds like an exhaust leak but i can't seem to find one. when i cover the
tailpipe, the noise goes away. any ideas? btw, i put on a new leistritz bus
muffler kit from bus depot. oh yeah, the heater boxes that came on the
engine have no heat fins! i guess that's fine in mexico, but not here in
ohio :-( anyway, i bought some of ron's nos heater boxes that i need to fit.

lastly, it seems to miss pretty badly until the engine is warm. could this
be the lack of thermostat?

that's it for now. any thoughts welcomed :-)

tony
