Subject: Re: [VB] Low-down cryin' shame

Hey,

I've been in a place like that. The &quot;town&quot; was Ruby, Arkansas. With the 
classic signs that point every which way sayin' &quot;New York 1136 miles&quot; 
etc. Neither the town nor the road were on the map (a recent map). Just 
outside of town was an old Ford pickup stuck in a tree from a recent 
flood - that nobody cared to move.

Given that there were bullet holes in the bus tells me that the locals 
have bullets, and of course have guns. Messin' with someone's shootin' 
target probably would get you shot at.

But the sunroof, I would probably dodge bullets for the sunroof. And 
besides, I bet Kelly could weld up some of those holes! I smell a 
finder's fee.

BTW, near there is Devil's Den State Park (absolutely beautiful) where I 
saw a 67 SO camper chuggin' up and down the hills.
