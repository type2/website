The Northern Nevada Volkswagen Association (still not
sure of a name or direction) held the second ever 'get
together' tonight in Sparks Nevada. We had thirty four
VW people show up(along with 6 Type II's) for a BBQ at
a local VW repair shop called 'Not Just VW'S' owned
and operated by Anton Walker. Anton opened his shop
for the gathering and provided the food,drink and a
raffle prize. Thanks Anton !
We are planning to have many of the Reno area people
together this Sunday at the Sacramento Bug-O-Rama.
Watch for the windshield stickers showing our group
name on our Northern Nevada VW's....
If anyone in the area is interested in our new group
and is going to the Bug-O-Rama,and certainly any and
all Vintage Bus Digest listees, please stop by my 67
Sundial (with plates that read'SUNDIAL')or my 62 Blue
Double Cab and say hello! Look for the windshield
sticker.
We are still looking for anyone interested in a Hot
August Nights car show and cruise en mass. Let me know
Thanks again to Steve Hansen and Jim Becker
