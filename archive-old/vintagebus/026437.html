hey guys, I finally found out who was lurking in my town with a
bus...and they need to sell it fast to get money to tour with.
and its on the vintage list because...68 and 69 are vintage now...hehe
(that 30+ years thing ;) and the 71 is a real close call to being
vintage.

anyways.
1971 bus - 7 passenger
usual rust in rockers
500 miles on rebuilt engine
turns on a dime, parks on a dime, runs on pennies (so VW says ;)
it stops, it goes
the bus is mechanically sound as far as I know, and the bus was never
hit, just rusted, and not *too* bad.

I'm going to test drive this bus later on today and will have more
details to come.
bus is $1100 mainly to regain $$ from the rebuild.
it is in mid WI.  Ripon to be exact.

serious offers/inquiries only
this bus needs to be sold

thanks!
Isaiah
