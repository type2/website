Hi Clara,
Our 26FEB62 chassi # 908798 was painted sealing wax red over the outside and 
then the white on the upper.  Dash is painted white.  Eric&amp;Barb

Jamie wrote that his turkois/blue white may 62 built bus also had the dash 
painted the top colour.

My april 61 buildt bus has the dash pained the bottom colour.   It has the 
later style panels w/o pockets, FWIW, just sayig they didn't changed the dash 
colour when they changed the interiors in April  61.

Anyone else out there have a two tone bus buildt 61 or early 62 and what 
colour was your dash- the top or the bottom- just wondering.


Clara
