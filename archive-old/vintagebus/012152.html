&gt;Gland Nut (as
&gt; usual... second time I found this) was not tightened enough and it

of
&gt; the crankshaft....
&gt; 
&gt; Heres my question as I do not want to buy a new crank shaft.... 
&gt; 
&gt; Can I use some JB Weld and reinsert the dowels in the holes and let it
&gt; dry?...

No way.  JB Weld is dandy epoxy, but it is still plastic.  It won't
last a minute in those dowel holes.

&gt; They have a little bit of play but not alot.... Or should I take
&gt; it to a machine shop and have the holes redrilled?...

Better idea.

&gt; and if I do that
&gt; does the flywheel have to be aligned a certain way?...SO that the
teeth
&gt; align to the starter motor?...

Nope, but there are some balance considerations.  If you want to do it
right, take the flywheel and crank to a machinist that does balancing
and have them balanced together after the new holes are drilled.

 And What can I use to clean the gook off
&gt; that is on the Flywheel and Clutchplate as I know U shouldn't get
even a
&gt; finger print of grease on em...?

Clean the flywheel and pressure plate with rubbing alcohol.  The
friction plate cannot be cleaned as oil or grease will soak into the
friction material.  If it's one greasy fingerprint don't worry about
it. If it's soaked in oil then get a new friction plate.
