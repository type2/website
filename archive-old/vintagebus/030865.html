While I agree that most after market stuff is crap and useless to the average
consumer, some great things have come out of the after market world.  In fact,
couldn't it be argued that virtually all new repro parts are in fact after market
as VW germany isn't building them in most cases.  But any ways, that's not the
purpose of my reply.  Your point about the magazines is quite valid, and for the
most part everybody should take the magazine advise as just that advise, not vw
gospel.  Just because it's in print doesn't mean that they have any idea what
they are talking about.  Some of the people out in VW land have been trying to
improve on our hobby for as long as they themselves have been into it.  Ronnie,
Hoover even Joe Cali (while maybe not the greatest example for wanting to push a
brick as fast as possible) have all had an impact and have their own advise that
should be followed at your own risk.  I was thoroughly impressed when Trends did
a write up of powder coating at home saying how nice it looked and then a month
or so later coming back and doing another write up about how there is nothing
like the real thing.

I think that what it comes down to is if you are a member of this list and you
are still buying all of your VW stuff from the pages of either magazine, put your
crack pipe down, make a list of what you need, email the list about options and
then call Ronnie or one of the other vendors that have the Marbles to be here on
the list taking critiscism and standing by the parts they see.

I'm done,
A

P.S. As a side note, I subscribe to both mags, and enjoy checking looking at what
people are having built for them and calling thier own.  It makes me laugh and
feel good about the POS's I'm bringing back to life on my own.
