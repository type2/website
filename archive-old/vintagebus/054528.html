&gt; So what kinds speed difference are we talking about i.e. with a 64-67 center

according to the bentley,

...the 1200 40hp using a 4.125R/P W/1.39RG as
yielding 60mph _at_3.6Krpm as the top road speed using 26&quot;
tires. The 1500 51hp using a 4.125R/P W/1.26RG gets 68mph
_at_3.8Krpm. Using the 4.375R/P, 65mph _at_4050rpm....


Take a look at the chart below, which is an exerpt from my notes on this
topic. (available in the archives.  &quot;raistrick gear&quot; oughta find'm)

Specificly the 5.73 TFD and the 5.5125 TFD, which would be your current
(most likely) final drive, and the most likely to find final drive in a
64-67.

5.1975 TFD = 4.125 RP w/ 1.26RG (currently in my '66, usually requires a
				 specially fit 4th gear, because the bus RP
				 is hard to find..make sure you dont get
				 a .89 4th!)
5.5125 TFD = 4.375 RP w/ 1.26RG (stock for my '66.)
4.8888 TFD = 3.88 RP w/ 1.26RG (often recommended, sometimes with even
				higher 4th (.79? or even a .71?)
5.73 TFD = 4.125 RP w/ 1.39RG	(stock/most common for earlier busses)


Total Final Drives
       5.1975   5.5125  4.8888  5.73
------------------------------------
1  3.8  15.3    14.43   16.3    13.8
        14.8    14      15.8    13.5
2  2.06 28.2    26.6    30      25.6
        27.4    25.8    29.1    24.8
3  1.22 47.7    45      50.7    43.3
        46.2    43.6    49.2    41.9
4  .82  70.9    67      75      64
        68.8    64.9    74.1    62.4
&lt;above speeds all MPH at 4000 rpm. you'll see two sets of numbers here,
because I used two different formula to calculate these.&gt;
70 =    3946    4185    3711    4350
        4070    4317    3828    4487
&lt;above is RPM at 70mph for each of the above, in 4th gear.&gt;


So, roughly, in 4th gear, at 4000 rpm, you'd see 2-3 mph difference in
speed.

(all of these calculations assume a tire size.  the second line uses: &quot;..
6.45 feet for this, using the effective dynamic radius given in the
63-67 Bentley page 4, B-11 (12.32+-.12 inches)
...&quot;

The first line uses &quot;... .00126 miles as the diameter&quot;
