I hope to get at the m-code plate this coming weekend, I had to blow out of
town early to fix someone's 'puter.  The bus is at my parents' and I live
about two hours north, so unfortunately I only have a little time per week
to work on it :-(  I'll definitely post the m-codes to the list if there's
interest...heck, I'll take pics of the underside and put them online so I
can be sure it's *really* a factory sub-floor!

&gt; Hey ANdrew did you ever dig up your m-code tag.  sounds like you have a
&gt; special bus.  kinda wierd, hadn't heard of sub floors on buses that
weren't
&gt; double doors both sides or sunroof buses (that includes buses w/ dormobile
&gt; top), either
&lt;&lt;SNIP&gt;&gt;
