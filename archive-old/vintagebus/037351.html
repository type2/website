In a message dated 98-10-21 17:20:39 EDT, you write:

&lt;&lt; The stock 1600 crank while forged by definition is only partly forged.
 You can see both forging marks and cast surfaces in various spots . .

Hi,
Forging is a process where the metal is stretched and folded while at near
molten temperatures, just like taffy.  Then when the metal is folded enough
times it is pressed into the shape desired which gives it a cast look.  Then
those areas that are to be close tolerances are machined.  Which we think you
are mistaking for forged areas.  The only way to tell if its is forged is to
cut the crank and acid etch it so you can see the layers.   Eric &amp; Barb
