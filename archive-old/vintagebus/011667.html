......Paying someone to haul the Bus is definitely cheaper/easier.A few years ago, I bought a '75 Bus
that could not steer.(Beam Rot)I rented a U Haul truck and a flatbed to do the hauling chore
myself.One way,it was a 150 mile trip.I drove the Truck round trip to pick up the Bus because it came
out to be slightly cheaper than a one way rental.My total cost for the truck 'package' and fuel,
mileage and tolls was about 300.00,or about a dollar per mile.
    Recently, I purchased a '64 21 Window Bus (via Ron Van Ness' weekly classified posts on the list).
I was able to secure transpotation for the Bus from a private hauler in Springfield,Mass.The round
trip from my door to the Bus and back is 320 miles.(from Niantic,Ct. to Albany,N.Y.)Total cost this
time: 200.00(!) Around (give or take a few pennies)sixty cents per mile.
      The financial savings, plus the saving of time and wear and tear/stress factors make this decision
a no-brainer.If you have to 'save' a Bus, hire somebody to move it for you. It makes sense from every
conceivable angle!
