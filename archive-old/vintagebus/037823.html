&gt;... 1 '54 Single Cab and a Barndoor Panel too boot.
&gt; My question is about the year of the Panel I haven't got a chance to clean it out and get to the ID numbers to check the year. But I'm thinking it's earlier than '54 as it has no bumper in back and looks as if it may have had body bumpers at some point. Did Panels come with these or am I wishing?
&gt; 
SCORE!!!

As far as I know, Panels never came with body bumpers, only Deluxes did, but they could have been installed or it could be mounting holes for anything - bull bars, a superfly screw-to-the-body ladder, etc..

If memory serves me, Panels were second to last to get a rear bumper, behind Single Cabs.  SCs got it in early '54 so you probably have a '53.  A '52 or earlier would be a dead give away with the funky no-ventilation wing windows.  If it really never had a rear bumper, there will be no mounting holes for the bumper brackets, that's how my ex-'54 Truck was.
