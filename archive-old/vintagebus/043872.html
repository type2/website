I started having shifter problems, which I'll attempt to describe...

Basically, if you can get it in first or second, it's hard to get it in
third or fourth.  If you can get it in 3rd or 4th, it's hard to 
go back to 1st or 2nd.  

I messed with the plate, experimenting with it every which way, including
upside down, but I can't make it shift any better.  How tricky is this
adjustment?  And/or, should I be looking further back for my problem?  

Messing with the shifter is definitely a grimy, aggravating business.
I pretty much stopped trying to fix it and parked the bus until I can
approach it with some understanding,  somebody to hold the shifter 
from above the floor, and maybe gloves.
