Hi gang,
I am in need of a dual port center section.  The one that came with my new (used) motor has a late bug center section with the dual heat risers. This will not work for me.  If anyone has a manifold they are willing to part with I would be most appreciative. 
I live in Ventura, CA
Thanks
Jon 65 standard
PS I also have some porsche 356/912 heads that I'd be willing to trade for say, some Kadrons?
