Subject: Re: [VB] Aluminum block

Check for excess green locktite in oil galleys and such, the distributor
drive gear usually needs clearancing to be able to rotate freeley, etc, etc.

Make sure you do a complete test assembly to make sure you have no
interference problems, as well as make sure it is cleaned very well.  These
are problems common with just about all the aluminum cases that are coming
out. They're great cases once you get the quirks worked out of them.

&gt; A mechanic I trust with all my VW parts here in Seattle, Jerry at North
West
&gt; Connecting Rod, had some interesting things to say about the dozen or so
&gt; aluminum blocks he has worked with. One of the things is clearance for
welded
&gt; CW cranks. There are a lot of low budget CW cranks out there and many of
them
&gt; need to have the case clearance. The lifter bore tops need to be surfaced
and
&gt; chamfered to drop the lifters down enough to clear for even mild cams.
Then
&gt; the issue of cooling because magnesium disperses heat faster than
aluminum, it
&gt; seems to hold on to the heat raising the oil temp.
&gt;
&gt; Knowing all this, I decided to give one a try and have it punched out to
90.5
&gt; and drilled for full flow.  I'm going to cork it first and try it with a
dog
&gt; house cooler.\, but if it seems too hot I will go to an external cooler
and
&gt; filter. Hopefully this won't end up to be the nightmare met with by
others.
&gt; I'll keep you up to date.
