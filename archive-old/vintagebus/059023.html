Subject: Sheet metal question

Another sheet metal question.  I have a rear tin with the small pre-heat
hole on the left side.  I thought that this would be correct for my '65 AND
would fit the 1600 dual port I want to put in.  Apparently the spacing
between the heat riser openings is narrower on this tin than will fit the
1600.  Do you think that this tin is for a smaller engine like a 1200 or
1300 or is it from a 40 HP?  Is there a rear tin from maybe a '66 beetle or
bus that would have the pre heat on the left and fit the heat risers on a
dual port manifold?

Thanks,

Thomas
