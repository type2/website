Hi Tom,
Do it!  It should take alot less than an hour to pull the engine, one to 
remove the tranny, and another hour to remove the RGBs and axles.  Heck even if it 
takes you a whole day, we have never been paid $200.00 working for one day!  
As Paul has mentioned it can be a great experience for you and your son.  Plus 
a good way to show your son that one can work thier hands to achieve goals in 
life.  Not sitting in front of the TV yanking on a joy stick all day.  Also 
if you plan on driving this bus who is going to fix it on a three day weekend 
far from home?  That's right, you and your son!  What better time for you two 
to get experience removing the engine?  At home with no rush &amp; hurry, or out on 
some back country road with rain pouring down?  Plus you can take the time to 
do things correctly and get your bus running better than most any VW repair 
shop can or will do.  Having the knowledge to work on you bus frees you from 
having to call a tow truck and go to the repair shop to share out your hard 
earned $$$s.  Even if you do need repairs done at a shop due to say time 
requirements, you will have a better grasp of what the mechanic is talking about and 
better able to spot BS being fed to you by a disreputable mechanic.
  BTW make sure to loosen the axle and lug nuts on the ground before jacking 
the bus and doing anything else to remove the tranny.
