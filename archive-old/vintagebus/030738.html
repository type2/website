IMHO, &quot;ROS&quot; should only apply to an NOS piece that has been damaged in some
way and then restored to it's previous NOS condition.  That ribbed bumper
was not NOS before straightening and thus the term does not apply.  Actually
the whole idea of ROS is ridiculous and I should probably be slapped for
my above description... but I digress.

I have been told that that bumper is not straight, perhaps the PO listee
cares to comment?
