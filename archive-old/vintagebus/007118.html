The Westfailure once made the return trip from an OCTO meet in 4 hours and
15 minutes. That was Huntington Beach to Phoenix, 380 miles and included 2
fuel stops and dropping Joe off at his house on the West side of town. We
averaged around 90 mph on the trip, but obviously with the stops, we were
running faster than that. Fuel mileage on the trip was about 6 mpg. Speedo
only goes to 80, but you can tell sorta how fast you are above that to a
degree by whether there is any bounce on the needle against the back of the
zero peg, or is it buried there. Hardware included no redux boxes, and then
some.....

&gt; &gt; Ok.  I know I'm asking for alot of &quot;yeah rights&quot;, but here it is.  What
&gt; is
&gt; &gt; the fastest you have ever gotten your bus to? and have you ever gotten a
&gt; &gt; speeding ticket on the open highway?  Please back up the high numbers
&gt; with
&gt; &gt; hardware.
