&gt; I had fully convinced myself that I should use a new Mexican case in
&gt; the impending motor build. My main concerns about going with a used
&gt; case are oil pressure problems and failure due to prior overheating
&gt; of the case.  I have talked to several motor builders that still feel
&gt; comfortable reusing later model universal cases that have been
&gt; carefully checked for cracks, warpage or damage. Most approve of
&gt; boring the case. One of the builders rebuilt the B case in one of my
&gt; motors 12 years ago and it has held up well.
&gt;
&gt; The only potential drawback that was mentioned about the Mexican
&gt; cases was the plastic cam plug.
&gt;
&gt; Now I am wondering......I want to spend my money right the first time :)

If it were my money, I'd get the new case.  If the cam plug bothers you
get it machined for the old style plug.
