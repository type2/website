VWoA has contributed the Jerome Jamboree and Corona de Tucson (the other ABC 
event) at one level or another for the last 7 or 8 years that I know of.  In 
fact, one year, Sally Eberle from the their HQ came and camped out with us 
all a Jerome event.  It was kind of cool drinking around the campfire telling 
her our VW stories and listening to the things she could tell us about what 
was going on at VWoA at the time.  In fact, she got into a conversation with 
fellow lurker Mark Chambers about some engineering ideas he was working on 
and I thought she was going to hire him on the spot.  She did keep her 
promise and sent Mark a couple of hard-back books she had told him of.

In any event VW has always come through with at least something every year.

Just my $0.02.
