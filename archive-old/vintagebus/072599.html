&gt; Those 1/2&quot; lines scare me. If I was using a blue printed 30mm oil pump I would

Hmmmm? (pulls out physics book, checks to see if Pascal's principle is
still there)

The size of the lines does not determine pressure, but it does
determine the pressure loss in the circuit.  larger is better.
