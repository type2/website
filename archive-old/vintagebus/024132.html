I've bought lots of cool Vw parts, hard to find stuff and Have been real happy
with the prices. What I do is research  the item before bidding. When I bid I
make sure I really want to own this item for what my maximum bid is. 
I have bid and won on some very rare stuff (not only vw stuff) that I would
not of known was out there if not for the eBay auction site. I view eBay as
another source only.

I think the swap meet prices will continue going up with or with out eBay. Our
VW hobby is controlled by supply and demand anyway. So remember if you bid
$50.00 Maximum for a N.O.S.Oval speedo someone will bid $100.00 because they
want it more than you do. that's the American way.
Thanks ,
Kerry
