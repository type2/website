Subject: Re: [VB] German Bearings?

&gt;I tried BAP for new German front bearings for my 62.
&gt;They claimed they're not avaialable, and only have
&gt;Japanese.  I am *not* putting Japanese bearings on
&gt;my bus, unless it really is the only choice.  I did
&gt;get FAG inner bearings.


I think the Japanese bearings are probably *at least* as good as the German
ones.  Certainly they're better than Brazilian bearings.  My Toyota truck
has 189,000 miles on the front wheel bearings (I bought it new, so I know
this), which are no bigger than Bus bearings.  They've only been repacked
once!

I think I would avoid Pakistani bearings though...
