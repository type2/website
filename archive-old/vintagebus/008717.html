Subject: [VB] more tire pressure


&gt; spoke to bridgestone the other day... the secretary at first refused to
&gt; connect me to anyone, as &quot;it was sensitive information&quot; and couldn't be
&gt; given out; i pointed out the load/psi charts are often available in the
&gt; tire shops.
&gt; she connected me to the akron flagship store, where a very cautious
&gt; salesman agreed to give me some 'ballpark' figures, off the record.
&gt; sometimes i think the world would be better off without lawyers.........
&gt;
&gt; anyways:
&gt; when vw specified 185R14s on bay busses, this DID NOT mean radial - it
&gt; meant reinforced. same on the splits.
&gt; so saying that a 185 radial tire is all you need is wrong; if it is a
&gt; passenger-car tire, it at least has to be reinforced. better is a truck
tire.
&gt; second: the tires your bus came with were european tires (michelin,
&gt; continental, etc). different dimensions, slightly.
&gt; third:  those tires may have been constructed to slightly different
&gt; specs than american, tho he couldn't say for sure.  but the tires made
&gt; TODAY are not the same as the tires your bus came with - hopefully they
&gt; are better :)
&gt; he asked what make/model i had, and approx. what weight (i said 5400
&gt; lbs), and what the vw inflation was (30/40 to 30/44 loaded); his opinion
&gt; was that those figures were a bit low for modern tires and that weight -
&gt; he suggested 35/45, and go up if the ride and tread wear allowed it. he
&gt; strongly urged more pressure if the van was fully loaded, or towing. but
&gt; BE SURE to maintain the specified front/rear inflation ratio.
&gt;
&gt; his postion was (off the record) that tires made in the last 10 years
&gt; might not meet the ride standards that vw was shooting for 'back in the
&gt; day' at those lower pressures.
&gt; for another, he pointed out that most car makers deliberately lower tire
&gt; pressures to improve 'drivability;' what this means is that the ride is
&gt; spongier, more 'car-like' on our busses, because americans like that.
&gt; your ride might be much more 'active' and responsive at the higher
&gt; pressures, but you might not enjoy it :)
&gt;
&gt; the last thing he stated was that we should all go buy a GOOD tread
&gt; gauge - 'properly inflated at ANY load will mean that the tread gauge
&gt; shows ALL the channels to be the same depth straight across the top of
&gt; the tire, ie, in a plane. if you are overinflated for your load, you
&gt; will see a bulge with the gauge that is not visible to the eye; too  low
&gt; will result in the side channels getting deeper.'
&gt;
&gt; for fun, i'm going to call my uncle in akron (who was on the firestone
&gt; indy team in the 60s) and see if he can get me a load/psi chart from any
&gt; old buddies still in the factory.
&gt;
&gt; so there you go. make of it what you will, argue that a spec made nearly
&gt; 40 years ago must NEVER change with changing technology, state for  FACT
&gt; that you run 5 psi and never get any tread wear and it handles like a
&gt; ferrari, you have your tires at 70 and they sound like rapping on teak
&gt; when you tap em, whatever. 35/45 is where i'm at. i figure the people
&gt; who made the tire know what is best for THAT tire... in point of fact,
&gt; that is the essence of the explorer/firestone case: ford recommended an
&gt; inflation pressure up to 10 psi lower than firestone in an effort to
&gt; make a TRUCK ride like a CAR. whether the tires were defective and would
&gt; have blown anyways is anyone's guess; whether they would have blown and
&gt; no-one would have thought anything of it if the lousy design of the
&gt; explorer didn't make 'em roll like sausage is another.
&gt;
&gt; for me, 5 extra psi seems like cheap insurance.
