Hey there--
Are any of you guys going to the Rockford, IL show this Sunday?
I'll be there in my freshly done '59 panel! It'll be its first show!!!! 
Woody, will you be there early hit the water for the finest surfing in the 
midwest at the waterpark with your bus and board in hand?:)

Take Care--Pete
