In the process of stripping my bus in preparation of painting, I 
noticed that the driver's side door hinges were loose.  After 
tightening, the door begins to bind about 4 inches from total 
closure.  The remaining 4 inches is putting stress on the top hinge. 
I am now thinking that the PO kept the hinge loose to avoid 
damage.  Should I live with this or correct it?  How do I correct?  
Take the door off and bend the hinge?  I am afraid that would cause 
more problems.  

Also, speaking of hinges....my engine hatch hinges appear to worn 
significantly.  What wears out? the pin or the actual hinge?  Is 
there a good source for new ones?   Another problem I have back 
there is the hinge has pulled from the sheet metal of the engine lid. 
 Any fixes for that or do I replace the rear hatch completely?
