&gt;
&gt;I recently picked up a 66 standard bus that I've been working on, but
&gt;it is missing the &quot;black box&quot; that runs all of the brake lights and
&gt;everything.

Mostly it's there to run the turn signals and hazard flashers.  The
brake light wire does go through it, but it's easy to wire around.
Take a look at http://www.type2_dot_com/library/electris/vw-9prong.html
for far more than you ever wanted to know about it.  :)  &quot;Method 1&quot;
in that article will get you on the road reasonably safely for a
minimum cost - you'll have brake lights and turn signals but no
hazard flashers.  If you live in a state with safety inspections
where they want to see the hazard flashers working, you'll have to
do something else.

&gt;I was also wondering if it is in any way possible to wire my bus
&gt;without one (or use the same set up that older busses did)

See the article above.  New 9-prong boxes are not available.  Some
vendors sell a kit to replace the 9-prong box; it does work OK but
I have some technical objections to it.  If you don't mind having
a &quot;wrong&quot; knob on the dash, you can also use the switch out of a
later Bus (see article) to avoid wiring up so many relays.

You may have discovered this already, but grab a copy of your wiring
diagram in color from http://vintagebus_dot_com/wiring .  You may not
need it to get your 9-prong box working but it'll come in handy
at other times.

Good luck!
