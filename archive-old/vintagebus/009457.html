This could be caused by a vacuum leak, maybe the points have burned closed, or the condenser pooped out.  

I would check the dwell on the points first then go from there, also redo the timing after adjusting the dwell.  

I doubt it is the condenser, but a new one cannot hurt since it is tune up time.


Good Luck,
