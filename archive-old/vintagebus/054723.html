Subject: Re: [VB] clutch woes

How's the shifting?  Is it normal, or is it difficult?
Some of the symptoms sound like when I had a broken 

Sould also be a broken or bent clutch arm.

&gt; On the way home from work Friday the clutch in the DC 
&gt; started acting weird, here are the symtoms:
&gt; - engages further up in the travel.
&gt; - when the pedal is fully released there is a strong 
&gt; vibration in it.
&gt; - cannot detect any clutch slip.
&gt; - no visible problems; cable is fine as are both its 
&gt; connections (to pedal arm and clutch arm), clutch arm 
&gt; and clutch arm return spring also look fine.
&gt; 
&gt; So here are my questions:
&gt; Are these symptoms consistent with the TO bearing? I'm 
&gt; thinking one of the retainer clips let go.
&gt; 
&gt; Is it safe to drive to my bro's garage so I'm not 
&gt; pulling the motor in my apartment parking stall? I think 
&gt; no, if it completely whent it could buggar up a lot 
&gt; more... :(
