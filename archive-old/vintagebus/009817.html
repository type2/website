Subject: Masking Nose and Beltline
Date: Mon, 30 Oct 2000 02:09:31 -0800

Hi!

I am asking anyone who has painted their two-tone buses for advice on how to
effectively and efficiently mask the nose and beltline.  On the nose:  How
is it possible to get that very complex and delicate curve right?  I have
just spent an hour and a half just applying the 1/4&quot; Thinline tape to the
nose in 3&quot; to 6&quot; lengths to allow for corrections.  Once I get the line
right, I'll overlap with 1/2&quot; tape and then begin the paper.  Are there any
tricks or tips?

On the beltline:  Do I mask just to the lower edge of the perimeter bulge,
or do I cover over the groove underneath to start the lower color just at
the top of the panel?

Photos are more than welcome if you've got 'em...

Rain and temperature allowing, I'll have the lower part done by the end of
Wednesday.

Thanks,

Gene Cornelius
