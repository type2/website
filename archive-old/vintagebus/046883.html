Hi Stephen,
These, and a few other DPO screw ups, or lack of maintenance is the reason we 
compleatly go through all four wheel/brake/ bearing/axle, and steering 
systems to make sure a bus can make the first drive less exciting, and less 
dangerous.  We are glad you, and your new bus made it home safely, but 
barely.....   Do not replace only one shoe.  Differant shoes from not only 
differant manufactures, but dates have softer/harder braking qualities.  To 
replace one, or two shoes, and not the others results in a VW that pulls to 
one side.  If you really want to use some of the old shoes, use install one 
new shoe on each side with one old shoe.  This will even out the differances 
in brake shoe material, and prevent the dreaded pulling.   Eric&amp;Barb
