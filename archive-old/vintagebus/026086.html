&gt; Hello All,
&gt;  Ive been outside lookin at the '62 single cab till
&gt; the sun went down..... Hate this time change:) My
&gt; question to yall is, how do you think it should be
&gt; done? I mean when I look at a bus... the two tone

I own a two tone kombi. It really sets off the nose-shape. Commercial
vehicles (Kombis included) almost always came in a single color. They
look great this way too. And if anyone has even a passing interest in
things VW, they don't need the two-tone scheme to alert them to the fact
that it is a split....
But for all the kids, folks on the street, and casual admirers, a
two-tone bus or truck will get more looks, and more fols will notice
that it is not just another beater bus, but &quot;an older one&quot; with that
funny front end and two windshields....

Craig Sauls in Modesto has one of the very nicest two-tone paint scheme
trucks around, Rosy The Rocket Sled. It has the three-area scheme, with
the stripe and nose portion only in red, and the top and bottom in white
( or do I have that backwards?) I have a picture of it somewhere, if you
want to see it.. Or I can post the pic with his permission...


For that matter.... It just so happens that my server has decided that
Club VW of Western Oregon is kosher for non-profit status ( we are
broke..) and they gave me a whole bunch more disc space.

So...if anyone would like a commercial-free and free place to put up a
few pics or whatever, let me know. I have more than 100megs open. Bus
content only, please....
