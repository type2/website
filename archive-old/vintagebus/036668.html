&gt; I am running a 1600 DP with a 009 and a 30/3 carb. 
&gt; The engine runs perfect and gets good mileage on my

&gt; is, when I pull into my garage at night and close the
&gt; door I get a pretty evident fuel smell.  This is
&gt; usually only for 15 minutes or so and if I leave the
&gt; garage door open its ok.  I have checked all the
&gt; usual/easy spots.  No fuel line leaks are found and
&gt; the accelerator cable travels freely to let the
&gt; manifold/choke (whatever you call it) to close
&gt; completely.

Could it be that you have a tank, filler neck or fuel pump leak? Another
possibility is that there are fine cracks in your fuel line that are
invisible when the line is unpressurised.

I have had all of these and they could all be smelled outside of the bus.
