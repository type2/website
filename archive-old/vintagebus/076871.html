Subject: bad day . . . bus broken

Okay, I'm going to write about my sh*tty day, go ahead and delete it  if you want.  I wish I could have

well, it was a bad day from the moment I got out of bed.  Since it was past 8:00 am, the animals, who are used to being fed earlier, started yelling and whining at me.  &quot; STARVING !!!  FEED ME!!!  LET ME GO OUTSIDE!!!&quot;  
Hush, I need coffee and quiet.  Can't see.  Animals... in surround sound.  The quiet one zooms at warp speed and tries to trip me up.

The critters obviously don't understand weekends in spite of the fact that they roll around on a regular basis. Dim.  Persistant.  Bloody minded.
 I must have coffee.

later I had regained my equilibrium and got in the red VW microbus to go buy supplies, amoung them cat food and kitty litter.   Notice the tires on the right side of bus seem low. 

Boyfriend breaks right side wing window latch closing wing window, bless him.

Go to gas station fill bus, check air in tires.  Left side fine, right front at =12psi=.    Right rear about 25 psi. No wonder it was pulling to the right.  the tires are less than a month old d_at_mmit, and I bought new tires as I was sick of dealing with a slow leak. ha ha ha.  I'll have to take it back to the tire place and wait around while they sort it out.  :(  Get pet supplies at the grainery next to the gas station.  

Head to next destination.  1/2 mile later after pulling round the corner at the traffic light I step on the clutch to shift gears and something gives.  Pull into next driveway on right (another gas station) and don't make it into a parking spot.   Wierd noise when I step on the clutch.  Hope it's the cable.   Turn off bus, crawl underneath.  seems frayed.   remove wingnut.  Check wingnut fits the spare cable (I keep spare cables behind the front seat)  It does.  Random stoned guy walks by and seems to think a broken clutch is a mind blowingly insurmountable obstacle.  Luckily he leaves quickly without offering advice.  Remove pan from under front.  I give thanks it isn't raining nor freezing, it is a balmy ~40* and the ground is dry!   Manage to pop clip off clutch cable.  notice that my accerator cable is wired together, but it has been like that for ~6 years so decide not to do anything about it.   Have spare behind seat, it can stay there for now.

  Clutch cable wont come out from bus.   even with s.o. pulling it and me pushing no dice.    I decide it is a broken throwout arm and to drive home, only 5 miles (2 lights, one stop sign, one hill, not in that order) Put bits of bus and tools in bus.  put bus in 1st gear to start it.   My battery is good.  it works.

 Process to speed shift home. Remove other bus from garage.  Stuff broken bus in garage.  Use less broken bus to run rest of errands. 

not my best day. 

 Thanks for letting me vent.
