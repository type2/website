Subject: RE: [VB] barndoor fueltap pics wanted

&gt;Do you really mean BD?  Or just the later fuel tap?
&gt;
&gt;The Barndoor one has a little lever to turn it on/off/reserve, here's a
&gt;pic from the owner's manual:

Yup, I meant BD, as that is the style reserve tap I bought... what I DIDN'T
know is that there a few diff styles of actuating the tap!
Everett's photo shows a neat pic of a bus w/ a hole in the passenger side
-  you could stick a churchkey dealie in there and use it to flip the tap
lever around.
Thom kindly sent me some pics of BDs that  showed a different set-up

 where the tank is mounted in the engine bay, and the tap is reachable by
opening the hatch.
Thanks guys!
THEN there is the post-BD way, w/ a cable from the cab. So I guess what I
need is pics of THAT set-up, and I'll see if it's feasible to juryrig
sumpin.
Otherwise, I'll just poke a hole in that rusty side panel and stick a
wrench in there :)
