Subject: RE: [VB] Re: [T2] Rap on distributors

.050 stays comes in a little sooner than a .009 but I feel it is better on
the bottom end. I have heard people say bad things about them, but they were
using them for the wrong reason. A daily grocery getter would benefit from
one, a street racer would not.

Thanks Eric and Ray, What are the 050 specs? I heard these were bad news on
our
aircooleds.

&gt;
&gt; That sounds good. I'm running Kadrons and wonder if I'll need a vacuum
&gt; takeoff
&gt; and where that should go? Same question for an SVDA.

&gt; &gt; &gt; I'm running a 009 for a Compufire DX-IX distributorless and I get a
blur
&gt; &gt; of
&gt; &gt; &gt; numbers when I time it all in. Can someone tell me what's up? Thanks,
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; The timing with my 009 would start to 'scatter' once the rpms got over
3K.
&gt; &gt; I switched to my Mallory unit, and it holds rock steady all the way up
to
&gt; &gt; 7500 rpm (different motor!).
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I think it's a quality control issue.  My 009 was less than a year old,
&gt; and
&gt; &gt; was probably as precise as a unit 20 years old.   :-)
