Part 2 does anyone know if they put front disk brakes on busses. My 65
delux has disc brakes and it shocked the hell out of me. I thought I
would have some drums but they are discs. Is there any way of finding
out if they are original or are they from something else like a bug or
ghia?

not stock on a split.   could be a later beam w/ disc brakes (do you have 
ball joints or king pins?) or a disc brake adaptor kit was installed.   But 
hey, if it aint braked dont fix it.
