&gt; HOW DO YOU DRIVE WITHOUT A CLUTCH.
&gt;
Don't push the clutch pedal.  ;)

Here's what I do:
Gearing up:
1. Say you're in 1st gear, with the clutch pedal out. Accelerate until you are at the shift point for the next gear, marked by the little I line on your speedo.
2. Push the gear shift into neutral, take your feet off all the pedals but be ready to press on the gas.
3. Begin to ease the gear shift into 2nd gear.  Most of the time it will slip right in if you followed Step #1, sometimes you must slowly push the gas pedal down until it slips into gear.  Keep the revs low, you are going to be near the bottom end of 2nd gear.

Gearing down (tougher):
1. Say you're crusing in 4th gear on the freeway, wait until the speedo needle drops down to the 3rd-4th shift point, as indicated by the III mark on your speedo.
2. Push the gear shift into neutral, take your feet off all the pedals but be ready to press on the gas.
3. Begin to ease the gear shift into 3rd gear.  It may slip in but usually you must give it some gas as you press slightly on the gear shift, the shifter will ease in when the revs are right.  The revs will probably be high for this, remember you are near the top of 3rd gear.

I use the clutch for first, the engine revs can't go low enough to let you engage 1st gear.

Most of all, it takes practice.  I practiced just for the heck of it and now, 1/2 the time, I don't think I'm pushing the clutch in enough as I run through the gears.

Plus you never know when someone might let you drive their split-window or super-early Barndoor, you can easily make the adjustment to test-driving their full crashbox.  :)
