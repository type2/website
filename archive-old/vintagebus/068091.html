Subject: Ronnie and POR-15 advice

Ronnie,

You say don't sandwtch.  What is wrong with using POR-15 as an undercoating
underneath the bus, and then using the interior and painting over it while
still tacky?  Interior rust needs to be prevented, especially in the front
floor areas, and around the lower part of the bus  panels and floor.

Curt
