&lt;&lt; If you have an 009 distributor, then the 30/31 will make the hesitation

Hi Volks,
The 30/31 has a smaller venturi and will cause less HP no matter what you try 
and too much fuel to be sucked in unless jetted correctly.  Just helped a 58 
Westie owner install and rejet a 34PICT-3 carb for his 1600 DP to replace his 
30PICT-1.  Resulted in better MPG and more HP.  Eric&amp;Barb
