&gt; It is the drag link that has play at the steering box end.  I can push the
&gt; drag link sideways (ie towards the side of the bus) and pull it back by
&gt; about half an inch I think.  There was some play in the steering, about 2
&gt; inches which I believed to be normal.
  &gt;&gt;

&gt; the way I check it is have a friend lightly wiggle the steering wheel
while I 
&gt; lie under  the bus with a light and watch the ends of the drag link and
tie 
&gt; rods.  they should not wiggle.  Any that wiggle need replacing.  I also
eye 
&gt; the swing lever - the bit in the middle of the beam- the top part should 
&gt; rotate back and from, if it wiggles/goes up and down, it needs to be 
&gt; replaced/new bushings.  Never did that myself, but I hear it can be a
pain, 
&gt; and that it is much easier if the beam is out as you don't have things 
&gt; falling in your eyes and also that there is more room.  I like as little
play 
&gt; in the steering as possible.   

Ok I expect I will have to replace the drag link then.  I would like as
little play as possible, but most UK buses seem to have a lot of play in
there steering - they yearly MOT test allows 2 inches of play I believe.

On the subject of removing the beam, the only part I have left to do is
removing the front shift rod.  From postings I remember in the past I
believe this can be quite a pain.  I have plus gassed the area several times
in the hope of freeing it up a bit.  Now in the manual it says to remove the
screw.  Is this the square headed bolt - I couldn't see any slot for a screw
driver.  Should I use a pair of mole grips on this?

Thanks
Paul
