Subject: Sand blasters

I just got a compressor that is in need of a couple of new fittings,
that at the moment should can do just about any preasure up to about 85
psi for about 10-15 mins at a time, knowing that the sand blasters I was
looking at need at least 90 psi, is it worth it to get a sand blaster to
use with this compressor? I can get it up to about 120 psi but it wont
keep up at that preasure for more than a couple of mins and then takes
10 mins to get back up there again. I got it mostly for doing some
spraying and cleaning but figured it couldnt hurt to have a sand blaster
around as well, just dont know if its worth bothering if its not really
going to be effective.
All in all it wasnt a bad deal, I got the compressor, two hoses 30 foot
and 50 foot, Y adapter,  2 tire pumps, 2 spray dusters,  hand full of
fittings (just not the one I need) and a spray gun for $100. I could
have probly done better but  I am happy with it for what I was wanting
it for, just wondering what else I should get to use with it. any
sugestions ar welcome and appreciated, As I have worked with a few
compressors before but its the first one I have owned.

Should make getting the bus cleaned up and painted a bit easier, and if
the sand blaster is an option it will cut the sanding a time in half..
under the rain gutter on the roof is rusted a bit the paint has chipped
and flaked and its a real SOB to get the sanding done up under the
ledge. would be nice if I could just sand blast that area...
