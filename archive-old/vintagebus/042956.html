I don't know about the pro's and con's of sealed or not, but I have never
seen a sealed bearing in the boxes. 


&gt; If his prices seem to get reeeeeallllll low with volume perhaps a list
&gt; buyis in order......

AGREED!!! As a certified Collector Of Spare Parts &lt;tm&gt;, I would buy
bearings if they are FAG German or damn good equivalents.

What does the list say????? Wonder if we could get the venders to buy in
also. Larger volume means lower prices for all. Ron??? Jim???
