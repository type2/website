Hi there,

Thanks much for the information.  

Since it would take me a LOT of time to go to other web pages and try to get 
the information on other events in the US (time which I really dont have), 
what I have done is to add a section at the bottom of the web page for other 
Events Planners.  I have added this one as the first.  

If you know of others that should be added, please let us know.

Thanks much, and have a great day
