356 wheels use the same wide-5 pattern as VW's

&gt; Somewhere I picked up a couple of 15&quot; wide 5 chrome rims that weren't wide 
&gt; fives, but same width as 15&quot; bus rims.  They had the series of ovals round 
&gt; the edge like 67 bug rims though.  I planned on putting them on my 61, but 
&gt; the offset was too far out.   They were dated sometime in 65.   I was told 
&gt; they were 356 rims, but have no idea if it's true.
