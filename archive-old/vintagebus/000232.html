Hi NQ,
We whole heartedly agree with Thom.  You can do a far better job yourself, 
learning up close, and personal what really goes into rebuilding an engine.  
Plus you can take the time to do things so much better than any shop would 
do.  Like balancing, all the moving parts, installing a CW crank, making sure 
all of the cooling fins are clear of casting flash, making sure the CR is 
equal, low enough, installing a full flow fiter system, type 4 cooler, and 
much, much more.  About the only parts you can not do without really special 
tools are to rebuild the heads, bore the engine case, rebuild the rods, and 
regrind the crank/cam.
