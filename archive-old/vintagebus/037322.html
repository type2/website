&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Hi Steve,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;That would only happen due to a bad regulator.   Eric&amp;Barb

That's what I thought, but when I charged the battery and fixed the wires AND 
put in new brushes (three days later) the regulator worked great. Had no 
problems with the system at all. The only thing I could think of is maybe the 
key was on while I was trying to charge it? 
Steve
