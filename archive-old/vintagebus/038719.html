Are you saying the fan is 'egg-shaped' or does it wobble front to back?

If it's the latter, I had a similar problem once, and it ended up cracking
the fan in a complete circle just under the washer. Made a horrible racket
at all rpm's, so I welded the thing back together until I could get another
fan, which worked for a while.

My spare fan had a bit of run-out as well, so a few taps with a rubber
mallet (with the fan mounted on the generator, out of the bus) straightened
it out.

If it's egg-shaped it might be better suited as a hamster fun-wheel.
