Subject: Re: [VB] How good can the steering get?

I just replaces all the tie rods (changed to 4 adjustable ones), the Drag
link, and did the center pin kit.  My bus is LOWERED, with drop spindles AND
cut and turned beam.  I did the front end alignment myself, and I run 4.5&quot;
BUG front rims on 195/65R15's tires.  So with these BUG rims (which might I
add, the tires have never been balanced because no one has the adapter plate
for the wide 5 lug), DROPPED front end, and all the other stuff you're not
supposed to do to a bus, and guess what, it drives AWESOME.  My steering box
has about 4 inches of play in it (in other words, my box will go 2 inches
one way before moving, and 2 inches the other, which is way less than my '67
westy, and I'm measuring this at the two arms on the steering wheel), and I
don't think that is excessive. It steers straight as an arrow, and doesn't
bump steer in turns or anywhere else, only problem I have is my tires rub
sometimes, and in high winds, the non aerodynamic box on wheels wants to
wobble from side to side, but I usually only see this at 65+mph.

So it can get pretty good, but still doesn't steer like any new car.

Charles
