Hi Virgil,
Much easier to replace any cracked axle seals, and check tranny oil level 
while the engine is out!  Also check your starter bushing for wear, and 
re/grease.  Take apart all the cables on the starter, and polish thier ends.  
If you positive battery cable has one of those replacement clamped on ends on 
the cable then either solder a new brass cable clamp on the cable of get a 
new cable with the lead clamp already on it.  Coat with vasoline, and tighten 
back together the cables to the starter.  If the engine has 30,000+ or 
unknown miles on it you should strip the engine down to a long block, and 
retorque all of the engine case, and head fasteners.  If you have a 200mm 
clutch you would be wise to make sure you are using a nine spring clutch.  We 
have had nothing but trouble with any other style of clutch in buses.
