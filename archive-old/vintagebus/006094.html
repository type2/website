If you change the fuel filter(s), fill up the tank, and put a carb kit in
the carb as well as putting in new points, new plugs (or at least clean
them), adjust the valves, gap the plugs, set the timing and dwell properly,
she'll run like a top.  Ignoring any of these items can be the result of
your sputtering in 3rd AND no idling 99% of time is a plugged idle jet on
the carb followed next in line by intake leaks due to leaky vaccuum lines or
poor sealing at the head OR where the carb attatches to the manifold.
