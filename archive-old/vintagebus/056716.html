&gt; how do i wire my radio so that it turns off when i turn the key all he way

&gt; car on?is that possible?

Hi SatireDUN,
Only by rewiring and installing a non-stock ignition switch with an accessory 
postion.  Otherwise if you listen to the radio while the engine is off you 
will burn out your points.
  We just make sure to never turn down the radio so low as to not hear it.  
If you need it that low just turn it off.  That way one does not leave it on 
and run down the battery when the VW is parked!  Eric&amp;Barb
