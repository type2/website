Subject: [VB] AIRS visit
&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; Tom Tarka came by tonight on the first leg 
&gt; of his x-country journey.
&gt; He needed a piece of glass for the driver's 
&gt; door and some extra
&gt; 14&quot; wheels for snow tires. 

thom

i wish he was going the other direction i could unload a set of M&amp;S &quot;14 five wide bus rims mounted up already

&gt; That's my 2nd AIRS visit this month, 
&gt; and the 3rd within a month's time!

props to AIRS of helping the Xcountry traveler in a veedub

aloha 

Ken
