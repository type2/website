&lt;&lt; Paulaner is definitely from Bavaria but I dont think that
Warsteiner is.  Warsteiner, Becks and St. Pauli Girl are rather lackluster
beers by German standards but are still better than American mass-produced
swill like Miller, Bud or Old Piles.  As far as Milwaukee's
Best...arrggghhh....better lets not speak of it.  I would rather drink my
own urine.  I am not sure if WOB has a local brew.&gt;&gt;

I think you will find most Germans drink Pilsner beers.  They taste much like 
Budweiser.
This is the most common type of beer I've found in Germany.

I used to work for Budweiser, which if you care to believe it or not, is a 
well made good quality beer still using the same recipe brought over from 
Germany more than 100 years ago.
