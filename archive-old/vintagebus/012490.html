I am about to restore a nice '63 Kombi, and am deciding on a beefier
engine. I want to go with a 1776 with hydraulic lifters, electronic
ignition, and maybe dual carbs, and run it through a later model Trans,
probably an IRS, but to maintain stock height will likely use a modified
swing-arm kit of some sort.

Anyway, my question to anyone is: Can you recommend the ideal engine setup,
in terms of carbs, ignition, flywheel, clutch, trans, axle setup, etc. to
make this a super-reliable, smooth-running, hill-conquering,
casual-cruising, quiet-running sweet little honey of a daily-driver Kombi?

Also, I don't know if this is allowed, but can anyone give a testmonial for
a company they have bought a complete turn-key engine from, and got a great
high quality cost-effective deal?

Cheers,
	Haxby
	'63 RHD Kombi
