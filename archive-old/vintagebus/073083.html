Subject: Thoughts on modified SP heads

My brother has an old 1641 that due to main bearing &amp;
oil pressure problems never did more than about
500miles.
It since has spent a period out in the weather &amp; of
the few salvagable items left on it area set of 1300cc
SP heads that have been machined to fit 84.5 or 87mm
barrels.
I'm interested in using them but am unsure about their
effectiveness.
I've spoken to a number of guys about them &amp; reactions
have been mixed.
One friend said the compression ration would be upped
&amp; I'd get a reasonable HP gain.
Another guy reckoned that although this would be the
case the smaller ports &amp; valves would mean the engine
got thirsty at top revs.
I only want to run a single carb on any engine they go
on.
Any thoughts on this or use of these heads in general?
:o)
Cheers &amp; God Bless
