&gt; Can I assume that
&gt; since the ugly buggy motor had a 130 tooth flywheel on it the bellhousing 
&gt; has already been ground out?  would a 130-tooth even fit in there if not?

Hi Russ,
With enough pressure it could have been just shoved in there.....  

&gt; How can I tell if the starter is a 6 or 12 volt?

ID of six volt bushing .494&quot;, twelve volt is .436&quot;.  

&gt; How can I tell if the proper bushing has been installed to use a 12 volt 
&gt; starter?

With engine removed, inspect clutch and grease input needle bearings and 
measure and inspect bushing for wear proper fit.

&gt; I noticed some metal shavings in the bellhousing and on one spot of the 
&gt; flywheel, like maybe something wasn't right...

Probably needs more clearance.  Try turning the engine by hand while 
installing the engine.  Personally we prefer using a six volt starter with a 
twelve volt solinoid and 6 volt toothed 200mm FW. No clearance problems.  
Turn the key in -6F weather and it starts right up!  Plus in emergencies the 
bus can be walked in first gear to get it out of the way if the engine dies.  
Also lots of six volt starters out there since everyone dumps them.

&gt; Thanks for your help!

Certainly!
