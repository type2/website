&gt; ello list,
&gt;    I've searched the archives but found no fix to my problem.  Strangely,
&gt;  SINCE replacing my fuel tank sender, I've found that when I fill up my
&gt;  tank until the pump nozzle shuts off automatically at the station, 10
&gt;  minutes later, my tank is overflowing with gas at even the SLIGHTEST
&gt;  incline.  Sometimes without an incline!  I cant figure out why changing
&gt;  the sender (from a non-cylindrical to a non-cylindrical) would change
&gt;  things in my tank so that this will happen?  Does this happen to many
&gt;  busses?  If so, what is a good remedy?  I cant believe VW let this go on
&gt;  as a problem in the first place?
&gt;    ANY input would help me much.
&gt;    Thanks,  J.D.

yes, it is hot.  gas expands.   I find it more economical (and better milage) 
to get gas in the am when it is colder, than later in the day when it is 
hotter- yes even underground the gas expands in the station storage tanks!   
After filling it to the first click in the winter I can just drive 5-10 miles 
and the gas does not expand out of the tank.  Now in the summer I need to 
drive further- as the gas in the tank expands MORE as it is hotter outside.   
So plan your fill ups so you drive at least 20 miles right afterwards, maybe 
30.
