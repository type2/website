&gt; Brilliant me just realized I don't have a sway bar on the front of my '65.  
&gt; Not even a stock one.  Or did they have them in '65?

Hi Joe,
1966-67 buses had them stock.  1965 EMPI produced thier accessory anti sway 
bar and when the stock one hit the market sales dried up for EMPI.  When we 
upgraded our pre-1964 buses to post-1965 front suspensions with stock 
anti-sway bars on our buses and it really did help.
