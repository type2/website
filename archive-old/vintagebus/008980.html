Hey has anyone seen this flyer

    It is a advertisement for Novell networking solutions. It has a 23
window bus with what looks to be a vintage stop brake light on the back
cargo door. The picture is taken on a highway going toward Salt Lake City
(210 miles). It has a bunch of cool networking bumper stickers all over the
back of it.

   I was just curious whose bus this is and if they are on the list. Some of
the bumper stickers read (My kid developed an Intranet for your honor
student, Save the world wide web, Honk if you're user-friendly, and so on).
