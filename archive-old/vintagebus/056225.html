Subject: Re: [VB] Dual circuit upgrade


&gt; According to the RMMW catalog, admittedly not as accurate as Bently etc.,
&gt; the 50-67(66?) bus MC has a 22.2mm bore.  Both the 211 611 021Q for '68-'69
&gt; bus and the 211 611 021J for a '70 bus also have a 22.2mm bore and are
&gt; non-servo units.  Has anyone tried either of these?  The local shop doesn't
&gt; carry these in stock so I could not physically compare to see if the
&gt; mounting is the same.  If someone could look at them and let me know which
&gt; looks to be the best match I would be willing to try it out and report.

You cannot use the 68-70 masters because you cannot get a reservoir with a
screw cap to fit them. The two holes are farther apart then the 67 and 72+
masters. 68-70 is [if memory serves me] 100mm. All the others, including VW,
Mercedes, Volvo, are 85mm center-to-center.
Unless you used the upper reservoir, tube, and lower reservoir from 68
[one-year-only set-up] or 69/70.....
