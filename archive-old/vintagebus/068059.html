Subject: Split MOLDED CORNER W/S

  Well they are finally on the way. I have a container from Europe leaving
next week and there are 10 sets of the NEW moulded corner (just like NOS)
winshield seals in it along with a lot more goodies  A couple more items on
the way are early style mirror arms for the round mirrors, these are EXACT
cpies of original 58 and later (not wide base). Another item in the works
are 58 to 61 Aussie style tail light lens in orange and red!!
