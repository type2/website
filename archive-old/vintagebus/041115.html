Hello my favorite bus volks,
Once again I am looking to you for advice.
#1)  I am taking my bus to Alaska and the Arctic Circle in a little
over a month. I am expecting it to be about a 8,000 mile round trip.
What do you fine volks think I should bring with me as spare parts?
What about tools?
#2) I now have all special parts necessary to put the thermostat setup
on my bus. I have a new Brazil case with no thermostat bracket
mounting hole. How deep can I tap the case without risking big
trouble? The mounting bolt is an 8mm diameter x1.25mm threading,
right? How long?
Thanks,
Joel
