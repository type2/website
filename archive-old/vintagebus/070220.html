 1st question-- How much movement of the transmission shaft (I want to call
 this the input shaft) is acceptable??  With the engine removed, I can take
 this shaft and move it around 1/8 &quot;, maybe a little more.  Is that normal??
 It seems like a lot to me, but I don't know.
 ...................
they always wiggle a little.    Turn the shaft, it should be smooth.  If it 
sounds rumbly that's bad.

 2nd question--How difficult is it to remove the Gland nut?   Reading Muir,
 it looks like a major undertaking.  Can you do it with hand tools or is it
 like the nuts on the rear axel??
  &gt;&gt;

easier that rear axle nuts, can be done with hand tools.  often helps to have 
a friend stand on the engine when you undo the nut.  if you need that, the 
nut was put on too tight.
