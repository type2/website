This is why all my stuff has been up for sale, found an og paint 56 23 
window. It was even bought at a local dealership. also came with a few 
others. pictures in the gallery at www.thesamba_dot_com, I also put  them in the 
vintagebus gallery, but I guess I f-d up loading them because only one has 
shown up so far. 
    looking for used or nos seat upolstery, drivers kick panel, and  
middle/rear seat kick panels for the 56. dont  have much cash, but lots for 
trade.
