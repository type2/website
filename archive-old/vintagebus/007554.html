&gt;After the tank is complete, seal it up, then pressurize it by blowing into
&gt;a vent tube by mouth only.  Seal the tube and wait a day.  Pressure still
&gt;the same?  If so, you have a winner. If not, time for soapsuds!

Great suggestions George,,,
here is my 2 cents
When I test a tank that only requires a low pressure,, I use a bicycle inner
tube,, this helps to keep the pressure low enough for safety
if you cut the tube so that you can hose clamp the one end over the tank
filler hole, plug the other end and the rest of the holes in the tank , you
can use a hand pump or use a quick burst of air from the compressor to fill
the tank thru the bicycle tube schreader valve,,
then squirt soapy water on the seams ,, and watch for bubbles
The inner tube makes sure you never get a high pressure build up in the
tank, as the inner tube will bulge,,,
get the idea,
A friend of mine uses a acetlyne regulator to put air into tanks,, as 2 psi
will split a tank,, but he tests alot of tanks, so it was worth it for him

ps... you can use the same set up on a Rad,, put both the inner tube ends on
the rad hose fittings,, and pressurize it,, sink it in a tub of water or
squirt soapy water on it,, and watch the leaks
