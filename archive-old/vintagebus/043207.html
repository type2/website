Let me first say that safety is worth $250. Having said that, To the best
of my recollection, the cups (seals) in the 67 master cylinder are 22mm
types, possibly the same as used in either the front or rear cylinders of
the 67. It's been decades since I doctored my 67's MC. Last I knew, NAPA
foriegn parts stores had 'rebuild' kits (cups) for both the master and
wheel cylinders for our 67's.

All that said, if you can locate new cups, you still must carefully check
the cylinder's bore for corrosion, as the bore must be slick and smooth.
You used to be able to buy cylinder boring attachments for your drill
motor, to carefully and slowly smooth out a slightly corroded cylinder.
Most of the corrosion would be near the outside end, where moisture can
get to the bore. But deeper inside must be checked too, as bad fluid can
hold water in there as well.

Be safe!
