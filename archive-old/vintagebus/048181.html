sometimes removing the zerks, cleaning out some stuck crud with a thin 
implement, and putting the zerk back on helps.  I had a zerk that wouldn't 
take, but it would spit the grease roun where it fit into the spindle there,  
think I got another and now it works fine.    Pump grease in til clean grease 
comes out- then you have it all lubed with clean grease, not cruddy grease, 
or wet grease which has a thinner glippy consistancy and does not lube as 
well.   The bus is jacked up, right?

grease is good.  Grease is cheaper than king/link pins.   wipe that old 
grease on the bit where your brake cable goes round the bend, and on the 
moving bits for your pedals while you are under there.   I put an old yogurt 
container unde  the end of the torsion tube so the grease will fall into it 
as it is pushed out past the rubber seals.    

Maybe the mechanic meant the *link*pins were too tight?  The link pins can be 
adjusted, but you cant really do tha to the king.

Good idea you are lubing it, your new bus will like it.   I used to only lube 
it every year, but then realised it was better to do it more often, esp as 
the roads aren't all that good, and I load and unload the bus, so sometimes 
it rides higher and sometimes lower.  Well, actually, it started squeaking 
after a particularly laden journey, so I greased it and found it took  a 
bunch of grease.   hm?   So now I grease at every 3K tune up.   Funny thing 
is it takes quite a while to get rid of all the old grease in there.

hello,

I searched both the archive and the library for an answer to my question but 
was not able to find what i am looking for.

My problem is that i am having a hard time getting grease in the front 
kingpin zerk (the one that holds the brake line mount) and the small 8mm 
zerk on the link pin that points forward also.   I always thought that 
grease was supposed come out somewhere and that was how you knew when to 
stop.  The only place that it releaved pressure was on the gun where the 
hose screws in.
Here are the conditions
New Zerks
Last lubed 800 miles ago. Last time it felt like it took some grease, This 
time not much if any.
New gun
When i first got it it pulled all over the road  mechanics said kingpins 
were in to tight.  They have been getting better as they have had more use.
Many many thanks
