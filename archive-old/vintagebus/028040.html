I bought an NOS OG full ganstap pimp 36hp muffler one time for $20,
and &quot;wasted&quot; it on the '55 westy.  I took a lot of crap from the local
bus growers for that.

There was an NOS eberspacher 25hp muffler on ebay a couple years ago
that went for somewhere in the 600-range as I recall.

Some of these parts were made to be used.  Otherwise, what's the point,
other than bragging rights?

Also, what do you guys do with the *boxes* from your NOS goodies, after
you use 'em?  I've seen people trying to get big bux just for the *boxes*,
which I don't get.

&gt; and factory instructions.  It's a real cool display piece.  I wouldn't actually
&gt; use it.
