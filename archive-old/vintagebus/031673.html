This is a news alert warning for the Red Barn. 

It is on a very BUSY Hwy, where people think the faster you can go around a
blind corner the better.

If you are heading NORTH on the Hwy and pass it the first turn-a-bout is a
mile or so up the Hwy if I remember right, I know I passed it.

But as it says it is a RED BARN (huge) on the right side of the Hwy heading
north.

LBB does tacos on Friday night and hope others will contribute to a pot luck
sort of thing.

If things haven't changed, they lock the gate at dark, so those that arrive
after camped outside in an open field just north of the Red Barn, but if the
nice watchdog gentelman is there again this year he did open the gate and
let a bunch of buses in afterdark.

If John and I do like last year we should arive  2ish/3ish on Friday.

&gt;Ok, the flyer
&gt;(http://www.redshift_dot_com/~taylorvw/svt/BYOB.gif) says
&gt;The show is on Sat the 21st. It also says &quot;Free parking
&gt;lot camping Fri night&quot;. If I want to score some O.G.
&gt;safaris at the swap, when do I need to show up?

As the guy who partially designed the flyer, either show up and spend the 
night Friday.  Or arrive around 6am Saturday.  I doubt you'll miss out on 
any nice OG deals.  :)

&gt;  Is the Taco feed and all the rest on Friday or
&gt;Saturday, and is there camping Saturday night also,
&gt;followed by a caravan to KP on Sunday morning??
&gt;  Is the earth round or actually an oblong spheroid?

Ronnie, John, and the LBB boys are doing the Taco feed Friday 
night.  Saturday night there is NO camping at Red Barn.  I think the Split 
Bus Club has a get together somewhere local, but I don't know exactly 
where.  The earth is halfway between round and oblong.  ;)

Another chapter member and I went down to Red Barn last Saturday to scope 
the place and hopefully make some mental notes about parking and so 
forth.  It should be a good turn out and a fun time...we're designing the 
ballots and stuff now.  Since this is our first year holding a show here, 
things may be a little hectic coming in the gate...I have no exact idea how 
many people to expect, how many will be showing, and how many will be 
swapping.  I want to personally ask everyone planning to attend to please 
be patient and understand that we're still getting this crazy shin-dig on 
its feet.  You've all been to shows before, you know how it can get a 
little turned around...so just hang in there and be flexible.  This way 
everyone can have a great time.  :)

PS: Wait till you all see the awards...they're very Silicon Valley. ;)
