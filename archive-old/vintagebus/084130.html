Subject: RE: [VB] Re: Weird occurrence with turn signal?

Thanks for all the help with the electrical schtuff!!! I'm somewhat lost when it comes to this kind of stuff. I try to go off of my 18x 24&quot; wiring diagram as much as possible but it sometimes gets me into trouble being the various mods the PO's have done and the lack of the right color coded wire. Sometimes I'll even pull out a paintbrush and stripe the various replacement wires to look like factory stuff. I wish I could use the assistance of my father in law because he is an electrical engineer but he doesn't approve of the bus and thinks it's a money pit so I refrain from talking to him about it.
I'm getting kind of jealous of all the talk of the various VW fests going on throughout the country, it seems they are all either Midwest or far West. I'm just trying to get my bus ready to take on a road trip to Every Bus in April as it will be my last attempt to make it there before I move from the East coast to the West coast. But I know I'll be in VW heaven when I'm in San Diego.
