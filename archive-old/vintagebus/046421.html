Subject: Re: [VB] middle seat question / trade / parts needed to repro

Hi everyone,
VW did in fact offer a full length middle with a walk-thru.
My 63 15-window has this.
Factory welded floor plates at the cargo door. M-code for walk-thru.
Technically my bus is an 8-passenger, which is not listed in any of the 
m-code guide books.
Strange, but oh well.
At least I finally have the correct middle seat finally.
