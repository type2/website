Subject: Fuse Block Retention???

What am I missing here?  On one end of the Fuse Block there's a lip that hooks
in the bracket. The other end doesn't appear to have anything that secure it
in place. I've got 3 fuse block and they're all the same.  Anyone know what
I'm missing.  I've checked the Bentley, and nothing mentions it that I found.

While I'm on Fuse Blocks.  Anyone have an extra Fuse cover they'd sell?
