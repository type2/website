Subject: RE: [VB] Lowered Frontends

Dave,

Yes, you're supposed to do something different with the tie rod ends...
since I'm going all original, I'm actually making some adaptors for my
original tie rod ends to the lowered spindles that I got from Wolfgang (ok,
ok, non-og parts on the dc do include the spindles and rear spring plates...
just so I didn't have to modify my original parts for &quot;the day&quot; when my
desires change).  There's actually a little more involved than just making
some tapers to adapt the old ends to the WG spindles but I'll fill in
everyone once I get it actually all worked out.  Right now, I have a 1 1/2 &quot;
toe in and the one tie rod is adjusted all the way in!!!

Dave asked:
Ok, I know this isn't popular with purist.  But the 66 is getting lowered
Spindles.  For you folks that are using lowered spindles; Were are you buy
Tie Rods and Ends separetly?  I know I have to use outer Ends from 68 and up
to get the bigger shaft.
