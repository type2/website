&lt;&lt; Well i will open this up with a question of length on splitty roof
racks--they do come in many sizes---from 1/4--1/2--3/4--and &quot;full&quot; length--so
my question is--what is the &quot;correct&quot; length of a Full Length metal roof rack
for a splitty bus that was made by VW?  &gt;&gt;
Hi Jerry &amp; Melissa,
Well actually they seem to come in 1/3, 2/3, and full length if are talking
the full metal, and not the wood/steel and/or aluminuim westie models.  VW
never made the racks themselfs that we know of.  They subcontracted the racks
&gt;from manufactures of roof racks and then sold them through the factory and
dealerships.  There were also manufactures of roof racks for the buses here in
the USA and they come in all sorts of measurements.  If you mean the German
full length made in the 1960s then they are about as long as the bus roof
itself.  Eric &amp; Barb
