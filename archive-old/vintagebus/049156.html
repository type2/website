Is that a split van taking Duke on the Tri-City Campaign? 

Had a great time in Jerome. Karl's '77 Westy had two flats on the way to Phoenix. He carries two spares. No problems getting to Jerome where we had a great time burning hot dogs and drinking beer. What was that elderberry cider? Good to see everybody, yada, yada, yada. 
Leaving on Sunday, the coil gave up 50 miles south of Flagstaff. Cell phone and AAA+ got us atow to the Napa shop where they had closed earlySunday afternoon for an employee appreciation dinner. So off to AutoZone for the '80 Rabbit coil. Back on the road with about 15 million trucks. Got 51 miles past Needles when the right rear tire blew for the third time about 9 p.m. Waited 2 hours for the tow truck and watched 7.5 million trucks go by. Lost our 'free' 50 miles when we were towed back to Needles. Needed sleep and slightly cheaper tires, so stayed the night. Finally got to Fresno at 2 p.m. on Monday after about 1,500 miles. Did make a quick stop out in the desert to see a stash of baja bugs, engine parts, a few T3's and one '66 kombi. Couldn't wake anybody up to make inquiries, they're still out there. 

One more... Drove the DC to work today and noticed a trail and puddle leading to my left valve cover. Not a lot of oil lost in the 3 mile drive, but a steady drip at idle. Assuming it's the valve cover gasket, why would it let loose all of a sudden?
