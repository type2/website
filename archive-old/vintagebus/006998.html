Tell them your reserve, get rid of the game players and get the serious
people on it. If your reserve is low enough and enough people are on it you
will get your reserve and whatever market will bare. This way you know it's
sold (if reserve is met) and can kick back and watch the vultures pray on
each other.

ronnie,  maybe I should list the 55 Barndoor panel on ebay for sale :?)

Hi Folks,
I'm listing an bus item on E-bay and have set a reserve.  I keep getting
messages from perspective bidders asking my reserve.  Is this common
practice?  Should I disclose this information.  After the $3000 middle
seat episode, I'm wearing my flame retarding suit ;0)
