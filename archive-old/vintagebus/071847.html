Ronnie,

Thanks for writing this long and detailed answer.  I most have a Kombi,
since mine has slots for hardboard in the front cab.  I want to keep it all
stock, so what goes in the back?  There is glue on the roof in the front and
back that looked like it held up insulation, what are people putting here
for a replacement?  Secondly, can I buy the hardboard for the front?

-Wayne
