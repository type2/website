&gt; I would put the van into first gear while the engine is running, hold down
&gt; the brakes, then let up on the clutch.  If dies right away, then your
clutch
&gt; is good, if it keeps running/revving, then your clutch is shot, and I
would
&gt; look at that.  That's an easy test, and with as much fluid leaking as you
&gt; said it did, it's quite possible that the clutch is soaked.

Tried that stalls out like it should.  So that is not it.  Thanks for the
try.

Peace Brother,Snoopy
