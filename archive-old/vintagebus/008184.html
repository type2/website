    I've never had to order them... but I would definitely prefer metal
plugs over plastic ones.
    That's another reason to look elsewhere, I suppose.
    The local flaps has a wonderful assortment of OEM taiwanese parts for my
vw... somewhere in the colorful arrangement, I noted the presence of fan
housing plugs... welch plugs yes, but for plugging the heater air outlets of
the fan shroud. That might be worth checking out and measuring in the quest
for quality steel plugs.
    There's gotta be a place... (checking the search engine).
    Ok.. http://mdmetric_dot_com/prgde3b.htm advertises that they have the
largest selection of metric stuff in North America. *including* expansion
plugs/freeze plugs... If i needed some redux box plugs, I'd check there
first. ;)

later...

&gt;Don't buy the junk plugs that RMMW sells...  They are flimsy plastic,
&gt;not metal.
