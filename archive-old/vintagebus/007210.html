&gt; The weather here in Nebraska is starting to get to me.  Another 6&quot; of
&gt; snow overnite on top of an inch of sleet and freezing rain yesterday.

Hey Terry,
It seems like a long time ago when we met at BBNTA and it was 104 degrees
in the campground.
What you guys got yesterday in Omaha is on my doorstep this morning, I am
about 50miles east of the Mississippi.
All this rain has washed away the snow and I found my westy once again.
The thing about white buses in the midwest winter, is that they get lost
easily,
even in the driveway. Mine sits outside while my '61 beetle sits in pieces
in the garage.
Hang on, and see my next message for some relief.
John
