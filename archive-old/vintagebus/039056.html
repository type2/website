Subject: Loaf-to-splitty front end beam swap?
Date: Tue, 25 Jan 2000 08:50:17 -0600

I saw on the type2 list that there is a nice 71 front beam for sale in
Amarillo, TX (an area I travel to regularly).  Can this beam be swapped into
my 58 single cab?  I checked the resource library and it sounds like it is a
bolt-in for later splitties, but I wanted to check the collective opinion of
the list on such swap.

Obvious advantages:  Disc brakes (those of you that have ridden with me KNOW
I need any braking improvements I can get!!) and a smoother/cushier ride (is
my 58 the only one that feels like a Ford F-350 with offroad suspension?).

Questions:  Is this a bolt-on swap?  Which of the 58 and which of the 71
steering pieces get used?  Will I need a different master cylinder and/or
some sort of brake fluid pressure regulator?

Thanks for any and all help!!
