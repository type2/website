Subject: RE: [VB] cyclone filters

Your cyclones look like either dusty condition air cleaner (heavy duty) or
like a things. I will have to check the dusty condition and thing air
cleaners I have against your pics of the cyclone in your pics.

Subject: [VB] cyclone filters


ok, thanks to clara (and roger nang by proxy), i have a few cyclone 
photos to show the difference...
this is the one in the bentley, listed as 211-129-611  oil filter 
WITH a 111-129-605B cyclone unit:
http://www.ckoon_dot_org/vw/cyc.jpg

i assume the weird convoluted hose is the actual cyclone filter, and 
it attaches to the larger-than-stock aircleaner? note that it clearly 
goes below the apron tin.


what i have - and what everyone seems to mean when they &gt;say&lt; cyclone 
filter, is this:
http://www.ckoon_dot_org/vw/HDaircleaner.JPG

http://www.ckoon_dot_org/vw/filt1IMG_0523.JPG

part # 211-129-611B; and as you see, at least one photo has been 
tagged &quot;HDfilter,&quot; which is what the part number calls out to in the 
58 - 67  parts manual.

so either 611Bs are NOT cyclones, or vw changed what they called 
'cyclones' sometime between the 1200 and 1500cc motors. anyone have 
any other photos of cyclone filters?  when lind bjornsen sends me a 
service pamphlet on them, i'll post any photos in it.
