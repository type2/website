Subject: Re: [VB] water rotted case/ was vw auction

&gt;Is there anyway to repair the damaged section reliably? Can someone with the
&gt;skills actually weld another little bit in from a good case? Is there some
&gt;other method of filling the damage in? I'd love to put the og motor back in.

i HAVE heard of skilled welders repairing mag/al cases... they are 
few and far between and $$$$$$. 36 hp cases have even more magnesium 
than 1600s, so thy torch up quicker. if you live near a port, i bet 
there are underwater welding companies that would have the 
skills/equipment to do it.
your local body shop is just likely to scream and run.

the drain plate area isn't really carrying a stress load, so even an 
ugly rube goldberg repair should be feasible.
