&gt; Also, you can have the left hand snap ring come out of its groove, allowing 
&gt; the shaft to move to the left.  It only takes a few mm to make a heck of a 
&gt; noise. The return spring will keep the shaft from moving too far, which 
&gt; hides the problem to external inspection.

Hi Volks,
BTDT!  We had a TO arm that had a slot with its bottom tapered upward to the 
right for the C-clip, which caused it to pop out without any problem.  The 
return spring on the outside of the tranny did not help at all to keep the TO 
arm in place.  Result is tore up the TO arm and pressure plate release arms 
pretty badly.

&gt;&gt;I safety-wire this snap ring to make sure that it stays tightly in the
groove.&lt;&lt;

Not sure how that would work with the C-clip is pressed up against the left 
side of the bellhousing and this might damage the electron alloy with 
scraping.
