Hi, I haven't lived where it is as cold as the midwest, but I wonder what 
weight oil you are using- perhaps you should change to a thinner oil?   The 
thermostat is very important- do install it.  Really does help the motor warm 
up properly.  Then you should get less condensation into the oil.  And you 
get better heat, quicker.   And the flaps help the motor cool better when it 
is hot out.  Do you have the pre heat hooked up?   I have used cheap Fram 
filters on my bug for a few years, and have had no problems with it even at 
30F with 30wt Castrol,  but you are surely colder than here.

 &lt;&lt; This is my first winter with my bus. I live in IN. Twice now I have blown 
 the gasket out of my oil filter in the bitter cold because the oil froze in 
 the filter and blocked flow. I have a full flow system. I know the only way 
 to get the water out is to change the oil or get the oil temp up past 220F

 Hi Scott,
 Make sure the make of oil filter you are using have a relief valve.  We used 
 to use Fram filters and had two blow up due to no relief valve during cold 
 weather at only about the freezing temps (32F).  The WIX filter with thier 
 relief valves have been no problem in temps as low as -6F.
 Aslso install the thermostatic bellows and flaps in your engine tin.  You 
 just need to get the engine oil temp over 160F and make sure your breather 
 hose from the oil filler to the air cleaner is in place and not clogged to 
 boil off the water vapor out of the oil.  We have been runing full flow 
 filters on our engine for several years without problems.  Eric&amp;Barb
