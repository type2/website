Subject: mysterious wires

As I was working on my headliner, I found two wires, inside original housing
tucked in the rear driver's side roof corner of the bus.  They appear to
have always been there but never used.  They have the little metal endcap
things except with no indentations where the screws would have clamped down
on them.  I've looked on wiring diagrams to figure it out and to no avail. 
anyone have any clue as to why they were there?
