Subject: Starter bushing woes

Hello, list.

I am trying to install a 6V Bosch rebuilt starter into my '65 bus.
Before I do that, I am trying to replace the starter shaft bushing in
the transmission housing.  I removed the old bushing using a tap.  It
looked ok but I figgered I'd replace it anyway.  The problem is the
bushing fits on the starter shaft just fine sitting in my lap but once I
tap the bushing in the housing, it seems to squeeze down too much.  It
is too tight to accept the starter shaft.  This has happened with two
bushings now.  I use a nut and 12mm bolt drift arrangement to tap the
bushing in and it is going in straight without drama (though a fair bit
of contorting on my part).

Bentley does not say to leave it on the starter as you bolt it up, and I
don't see how you could anyway.  What am I doing wrong?  The engine is
in place.  Do I need to put a stone on my Dremel to get the necessary
milli-inch of room?  I have one bushing left for the weekend.

TIA

Michael
