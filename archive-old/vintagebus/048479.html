Was:  110 degree driving advice

&gt;also the temp seems to go up about a degree for each MPH over 55 MPH, so
&gt;an engine that is running at 215degrees on a 60degree day at 55MPH becomes
&gt;250 degrees at 70MPH on a 90 degree day!
&gt;
&gt;and at 110 degrees this becomes 265 degree engine temp, and I'm getting
&gt;REAL nervous (and slowing down!)


I've got to jump in on this one.  I havn't heard anyone list two of the
major causes for high cylinder head temps.  It is true that driving in the
3,000 to 3,500 RPM range will keep the engine cool, and a lean fuel mixture
will create higher temps.

In college, we did numerous dyno tests on vehicles and it really shows up
when you compare everything on the same vehicle, just supplant the fuel,
ignition timing and jetting.

The first important factor in keeping your heads cool is your fuel octane
rating.  Even though most VW's will burn lower octane gas (cheap stuff) if
you really want to extend your engine life and let it run a bit cooler, run
the good stuff!!  Higher octane means slower burning in the cylinders, this
not only lowers head temps, but also increases efficiency as well.  Around
this part of the woods, we have Amoco stations that have a 92 octane gas
that is CLEAR.  The Amoco gas has been refined a bit more and a number of
the floating particles that give gas a yellow color have been removed.  By
running the clear stuff, your carb will run cleaner longer and you will
develop less carbon in the heads.  If you want really cool burning fuel,
try alcohol!  Alcohol has a very high octane rating and will not carbon up
the heads.  Some race cars use it with great success.

The second factor in running cool heads is timing.  For maximum performance
and coolest temps, your dwell must be correct and your timing must be just
below the &quot;ping point&quot; of the engine.  Ping point is where your engine
pre-detonates and tries to force the piston backwards down the cylinder.
If you time your engine just before this point, you will allow the fuel to
burn more completely in the cylinder before being pushed out past the
valves.  It is the fuel still burning as it passes the exhaust valves that
really heats up the head and burns the valves.

How do you find the ping point?  If driving up the on ramp on the
interstate, or starting up a hill, you here your engine &quot;ping&quot; a SLIGHT
amount, then you are at the ping point.  You need to have a quiet exhaust
to be able to hear your engine.  If your engine is not pinging (by the way,
too much ping will also damage your engine) then you have room to advance
your timing.  Under normal driving and acceleration, your engine SHOULD NOT
PING, only under stress such as from a complete stop, driving up a hill.

Another advantage to running a higher octane gas is it burns slower which
advances the &quot;ping point&quot;, which allows you to advance your timing even
more, thus letting even more gas to burn, letting your heads run cooler.
