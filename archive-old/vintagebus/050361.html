I need help with the headliner.
I have it here.
What do I do first?
I got the large piece with extra material for the sides and that is all.
Don't have the ivory stuff in the gap strips or whatever you call windlace now.
I am missing one bow.
Are they supposed to be all the same length?
I have the two front shorties.  I have the shorter rear one.
The other four are, two same length, one 13mm shorter, fourth missing.
Where do they go?  Which one am I missing?
How long do I cut the listings?
I've done a few of these before, but the last one was 1981 I think.
We get older and forget.
I saw something on the web about directions but can't find it now...
