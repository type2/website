Subject: [VB] froze rod bearing.

when i took my old (seized) engine apart, i was under the assumption that #3
main was froze. now i have the crank and it seems #3 rod is locked. all the
other ones move freely, etc. it seems to be an aftermarket (brazillian? not
sure. everything else was) but at any rate, i cant get the rods off. the
nuts are off, but they still stay on there. my questions are why would a rod
bearing freeze and not the mains? (this is my ignorance showing through
here) and, why wont the damned rods come off? id like to get this thing
miked and see if its grindable. thanks for any and all help.
its too bad economies dont operate as efficiently as mailing lists seem to.
