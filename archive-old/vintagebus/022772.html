&gt;I will be getting out the Muir book (and looking at the 'Rituals' chapter)
&gt;today to see if I can exorcise the demons from the hubcap before I send it
&gt;on it's way.   I saw aprocedure posted a couple of weeks ago about using
&gt;candles and drawing a VW emblem with salt on the garage floor to remove a
&gt;persistant gland nut.  Will this procedure also remove demons from a
&gt;hubcap??  The _LAST_ thing I want to do is pass the 'bad moe-joe' along.

Ooooh, yeah.._dot_definitely want to get that out before it gets much further
west.  LOL  Else there'll be a trail of busted buses in its wake!

And you guys shoot me an email as it gets closer to San Jose, CA...I'll
happy take it a ways...even if it's just up to the Napa/Vallejo area to
hand it off to a Split Bus Club member.  :D
