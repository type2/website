Ronnie in Arizona built me a motor and trans setup for my 63 Micro. On his
recommendation I went with an 1800 dual Kadron, balanced crank and lots of
Scat goodies along with a re-geared trans. Both arrived here in Jersey ready
to go. After a thousand miles it just keeps running better. I'm using
Mobil-1 20/50 V-TWIN motorcycle oil with synthetic GL-4 in the tranny.
I also put in a set of #5307 Denso Iridium plugs and am pleased with them as
well. Ronnie was also a big help with advice and recommendations, making the
10 month restoration project most enjoyable. The list is also very
informative and entertaining.
As a result I am the proud daily driver of a basically stock looking 63 bus
that runs with the pack on the highways. Anti-swaybars front and rear,
Bilsteins and Michelins make it stay where it's pointed.  12 volt conversion
went well too. One odd thing though. Engine off, put on a blinker and the
gas gauge needle jumps in rythym. Engine on, no needle jump but the blinker
indicator light in the speedo no longer blinks. Weird. Any ideas I 'd love
to hear them. This happened with the old speedo and the new one I just put
in. Gas sender is new. All dash bulbs have been changed to 12 volt, same
results.
Anyway, I'd like to thank Ronnie and all those who helped me without knowing
it.
Bob Getz
