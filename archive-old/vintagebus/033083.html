&lt;&lt;  am in the beginning stage of doing work of the front of my 66 westy like 
 most I have the problem of drifting on the highway from lane to lane anyway 
 I was talking to some bug fok, they claim there is an adjusting bolt on the 
 box. ?? They claim I should crank down on it if I'm having a problem with 
 the box.  Does this make any sence to anybody

before adjusting your steering box, check out the whole steering dealie.  
John Muir's Idiot book gives a good description.   Lie under the bus and have 
a friend gentley wiggle the wheel in the loose spot. 
 Look at the tie rod ends, are they firm or wiggley?
look at the swing lever , does it swing side to side?  up and down as well is 
bad
how are the drag link ends- wiggly is bad
does the pitman arm go in and out of the steering box?  it should only rotate

Jack up the front of the bus, and push pull the wheel  side to side and up 
and down.  Up and down play indicates bad wheeling bearings, or bad king pins 
or bad link pins or some adjsutment needed.

My theory is tie rods and drag links are easiest to change, so I do that 
first.   I will deal with a little slop, but not too much.   I have a teeny 
bit in my 65s steering box, and the swing lever has just developed some up 
and down motion :(  in spite of my religious greasing fits.

grease, while your bus is jacked up grease the suspension- there are four 
fittings on each spindle, and four on the beam and one at the swing lever. if 
you have fitting on the tie rods or drag link grease those too.  grease until 
CLEAN grease comes out.  Will take a whole tube if not kept up with.   I 
grease at every 3K mile service.  Replacing king and link pins is expensive 
and a PITA.

wipe some of the grease that comes out on the moving bits in the pedal 
assembly under the front floor, and where the brake cables turn around that 
quarter circle thing..
