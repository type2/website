Yup!  Exactly right!

Flattening a bit of copper pipe (I use 1/2 inch water pipe)
and holding it against the hole from the front also allows you to get a nice
flat weld.  And you can just redrill the hole as often
as you like for replacement. 

I could take a pic (front and back of rim) of the 
finished job if anybody really wants to see em.....

Rob,

I'm just guessing here, but you're welding through the hole from the back
side
of the rim...right?  Not around the circumference of the clip....yes?
