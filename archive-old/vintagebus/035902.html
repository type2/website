Subject: Re: [VB] Dead mouse removal?

About the mouse:

Go and get a cheap plumber's snake, and bend open the spring at the end to, 
er, catch the 'plug'...Open the heater box connection on each side of your 
engine (under in front) and feed the snake in until you get lucky...Keep on 
twistin'...

Failing this, you might arrange for some neutrino particles and a linear 
accelerator.
The old bus will work well as a target.  

All seriousness aside, the little bugger got in there somehow--Probably a 
loose connection under the car.  Find it and follow his path.  Give him a 
decent burial.
Be respectful!
