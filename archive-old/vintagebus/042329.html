Well, I got the ol' '67 sitting on good feet today.  My friends, I gotta
say I HATE pneumatic wrenches!!  4 tires in 4 hours :-( and a
self-inflicted black eye!

Took a whole slew more pictures, and have some questions relating to some
of the pictures.  Also, I am developing a &quot;want list&quot; :-)  See below, and
if you have any and want to get rid of them, please let me know!

The whole set of new pics is at:
http://www.type2_dot_com/dworkin/67bus2

First Question:
URL = http://www.type2_dot_com/dworkin/67bus2/engine_serial.JPG
per David Easterwood's NEATO site, the engine block # says
it's the original - H 0 259 011  check?

Second Question: 

http://www.type2_dot_com/dworkin/67bus2/dash1.JPG 

there are a number of switches on the dash, none labeled.  To the left of
the speedo pod, there is the cigarette lighter and a switch... headlights?
On the speedo pod, there is a little switch at the bottom of the pod...
for what???

http://www.type2_dot_com/dworkin/67bus2/dash3.JPG

To the right of the pod, there is a switch with unknown function...
wipers? and a bezel for a switch that appears to be missing... for what?
also, the ignition switch is sitting on (well, hanging off) the parcel
shelf in the first pic.  I assume it goes in the hole in the bottom of the
speedo pod in the second pic?

Pretty nearly everything looks to be present and stock, altho there is a
fair amount of mechanical damage to the frame cross members between the
jack points :-( and the usual amount of rust :-((

To replace the tires...  understand that the lift on my hydraulic jack
turned out to be woefully short :-( I *gotta* buy a higher lift jack! I
wound up jacking on the steering arm in the front on the right side to get
the tire up out of the mud high enough to get the new tire on.  Then I
went to the rear and jacked under the cover of the torsion bar.  That did
not lift the rear high enough, but it lifted the front *way* up!  So I
went to the cross member under the trans, which did lift the rear.  On the
left side, I just went straight for the trans crossmember at the rear and
for the rear torsion bar cover for the front.  the frame on this bus must
be *stiff*!!!

Want list - If anyone out there has:

a cover for under the front (this bus has one, but it is in *sad* shape!)

a nice pair of side doors (mine are rusty enough at the bottom and
creased so that I think replacemnet is called for)
see: http://www.type2_dot_com/dworkin/67bus2/doorbottom3.JPG

a pump (I know that I can get a plastic replacement from an RV store, but
I want an original :-)
see: http://www.type2_dot_com/dworkin/67bus2/cooler_cabinet.JPG

a cover for the windshield washer bottle.  The rubber on mine is *toast*!
see: http://www.type2_dot_com/dworkin/67bus2/dash1.JPG

please let me know!

For the record:

The radio looks stock and original.  It is a Sapphire V, just FYI 

Next Steps:  

The bus will be transported to Arnold MD and Pat Flynns place during the
next week or two.  I gotta get a rear window in and at least the driver's
front windshield just to weatherize it.  I plan to pull and start working
on the engine ASAP (pray with me that is is not bored to 80 over or
spongy in the pan and, thus, dead)
