Bill Denning asked for alternatives to driving 2500 miles to the 1999 Jerome
event...

Firstly Bill, The membership of the Arizona Bus Club graciously thanks you
for your interest in the Jerome Jamboree IX &lt;1999&gt;.

Secondly, I suggest that you have your cake and eat it too! Contact Tom
Brouillette in Albuquerque regarding the rental of a watercooled Westfalia
from his business, &quot;Roamin' Holidays.&quot; Tom has rented dependable VW campers
(Vanagon Westfalias) for several years. A flight into Albuquerque *or
Phoenix* followed by a drive to Jerome in, easily accessible, central
Arizona would be a great experience! Airport pick up and a knowledeagble
staff is waiting with bated breath (but thats another story) Possibly there
is still time for THIS Jerome!

Contact Tom at:
roamin_at_rt66_dot_com or 800-969-8040

&lt;Brouillette in Albuquerque&gt; &lt;--- is that a spelling contest or WHAT?!
