&quot;The popping out of reverse problem is the detenses. which you can not
see through the bell housing.

The snap ring you can see does hold the shaft in place. You can pop it
off with a small long tool&quot;

That's a special tool or a off-the-shelf small long tool ?

Thanks for the offer of the reverse thread nuts.

Does any one want to take up this thread on how or where i can obtain
the reverse thread 22mmX1.5 die (Bus only) for the drivers side spindle
thread and what type of welding rod I should use on the spindle when I
build it up before cutting new threads?

Another thought on this spindle thing how did this spendle get to be
non-reverse thread?

My tranny has popped out of *3rd* on long steep up hills about 5 times
in the last 1000 miles or so. My reverse is ok.
