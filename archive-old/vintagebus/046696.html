 I've got an old oil pressure guage sitting here with a small amount 
 of metal tubing, and a fitting for the oil pressure switch area on 
 the engine. The guy used this to test oil pressure on engines in the 
 engine compartment.
 
 Got me thinking though. Are all oil pressure guages like this? Does 
 the pressure go right into the guage? Or do they have some other kind 
 of sender that just sends electrical reading the guage? If not, you'd 
 have to run a lot of tubing from the engine to the front of the bus 
 where the guage would be...wouldn't you. Seems like a long way to go.
 
 Just curious really.

no they are not all like that.  They make electrica pressure guages that 
register the pressure, and use and electrical signal and wire to take it to 
the front, where it reads on a guage.

However,  They do (or did) make the kind that have a tinyplastic hose all the 
way to the guage for oil pressure.   Even found a guage like that vdo VW 
style (made for a split) in a 66 bus, the bus was very original, and had sat 
for years.  the motor was gone.

I'd be scared the oil tube would crack.
