Hi Larry,
Yes, the radio is supposed to stay on with the ignition key off.  The trick 
about VW radios is to always leave it turned up enough to hear it and if you 
need to have it quite turn it off.  That way if you turn off the VW  while 
the radio is on you should hear the radio and turn it off!  This works well 
for the transistor radios, but the earlier tube type that take a minute or 
two to warm back up are more of a pain!
  As for your battery have you let it charge over night?  Did you check the 
fluid level to make sure it is over the plates.  It would be better if you 
had a lower amp charger (2?) for charging dead batteries.  Also how cold has 
it gotten during the nights while it was dead?  You might have caused the 
battery to freeze up and destroy itself by letting it discharge.  A battery 
is more likely to freeze at higher and higher temps the more it is discharged!
