Subject: RE: [VB] oil cooler heater

Nick,


I have read your post, as well as the responses.  When I first read your
post, I thought you were talking about the setup Bob Hoover preached about
in his 'Sermons'.  Based upon the reposes you received, I am not sure this
was you question however.

Hoover spoke of plumbing WATER, NOT OIL through a Doghouse oil cooler.

&lt;snip&gt;

If the van is well insulated, that quantity of hot water pumped through a
small
heat exchanger such as a dog-house style oil cooler, should be enough to
maintain a shirt-sleeve environment in the camper for several hours.

&lt;/snip&gt;

If this WAS your question, then reading the sermon points you in the
direction of setting up a Water tank, and plumbing the lines through your
exhaust as well as the 'cooler'..  You would need to provide a pump for this
water to circulate through the system.

If this was NOT your question, then nevermind...
