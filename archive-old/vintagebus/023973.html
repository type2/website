I would like to add one VERY MAJOR point about shims that has NOT been covered yet
in this thread....

By installing shimms under your cylinders, your are moving your cylinders and
heads farther out from the engine case.  Thus in effect you are widening your
engine.  Make sense??  Here in lies the problem, you cannot use your stock
exahaust system without cutting it up, and lengthening it to fit the now widder
engine.  I found this out the hard way....I put together a 1600 single port, used
.060 shims underneath my cylinders to get to a safe compression ratio, 7:0 -1 I
recall.  The shims added so much width to the engine, not only could I not get the
atock exahaust to fit, but the SP intake manifold would not fit either!!

Solution; well my soultion at least....I have now been semi-hemi cutting my heads
per a Gene Berg cutter via my local Machine shop.  This semi-hemi cut will  bring
a stock 1600 sp or dual port down to around 7:0-1 compression.  By Semi-hemi
cutting the heads you are lowering your compression, and as Eric said removing
potential hot spots for detonation from your heads.  Also, the hemi cut
illiminates the need for shims, thus you can use totally stock components
(exahaust and intake manifold) on your engine without having to do any bizarre,
time consuming modifications.  So far I have done this one 3 stock rebuilds with
semi-hemi cut heads and have been extremely pleased with the results....in one
customers bus he reports running nearly 100 degrees cooler then before!!  I run
3400-3800 rpm's in my 1600cc sp `61 Westy and never get above 210 degrees.

Rock and Roll.....

&gt; Hi Markus,
&gt; The best and quickest way to lower your compression ratio is to install shims
&gt; under the cylinders next to the case.
