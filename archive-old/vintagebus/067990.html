Subject: Re: [VB] Contact Cement vs. Weatherstip Adhesive

but roofing tar is god.

mmm mmm smells good too!

just a smear on the window ledge and part way up the corners before you put 
the window in.  I oil the lip of the seal the glass goes in, but VeeWee111 
tars that area for windsheilds to prevents more fogging.  I also oil the lip 
the string goes in, which helps pull that lip over the metal bit of the bus.  
 Someone once layghed and said that the oil will degrade the rubber like oil 
based lubes on a condom, and I said it's fine if my sp,litty has young'uns.   
 But seriously, my windows don't leak. (except the safaris)
