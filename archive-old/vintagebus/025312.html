Mathieu,

I'm sure you've already checked this out, or been advised to: I had some
shifting problems fairly recently that were caused by a bad front tranny
mount. Seems that the tranny will *sometimes* rest on the shift linkage
if the mount is broken. Since the tranny kinda moves around on the two
rear mounts, the shifting problems seem to come and go. If that's your
problem, I'll advise you that it can be changed without pulling the
engine and tranny, but it's almost easier to just go ahead and pull
them...
