Subject: Re: [VB] My new 62 15 window deluxe

The colors are sealing wax red (L53) and Beige Grey (L472).  I have a '61
15-window that was originally these colors.  And yes it would have
origianlly had a 40 horse in it.

&gt; It was originally red on the bottom and white on top, what colors would that
&gt; have been?
&gt; there would have been a 40 horse motor in there correct?
&gt;
&gt; Does anyone else on the list have one of these?
