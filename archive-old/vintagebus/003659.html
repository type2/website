HI Fellow busers

I was cleaning out the office today and I found a couple

NOS 1960-64 Owner's Manuals

Theses were printed in '65 by VW to cover the info for the earlier buses.
They are the same inside as the one that came in the bus.
Cover is blue with bus on front.

$40 including ups should be fair.

I have a couple others 59-64 range also

The Hokey Pokey IS what it is all about, I'm sure of it now.
