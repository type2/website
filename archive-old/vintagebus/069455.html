Subject: Re: [VB] Ambulance Fans

Yes Scott they are. At the last octo there was one for sale for $400 and if
you asked the seller if it worked he said he did not know but would hook it
up if you were serious about buying it. Everyone just walked on .
I have a cover plate from my '67 Kombi I totaled in a head on crash that I
am gonna mount 2 computer fans on w/ a switch. They are 12 volt and do move
quite a bit of air. Total cost around 50-60 bucks if that because I am
guessing. I am going to Fry's tomorrow for some RW-CD's so I will check on
the prices of the fans.
