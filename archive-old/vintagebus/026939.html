&gt; &gt; &gt; I was browsing through the Muir Idiot manual and found that he 
&gt; &gt;eliminated his electromagnetic cut-off jet.  Muir claims that VW sold a 
&gt; &gt;screw in jet to take its place.  Does anyone know what this PN# is or where 
&gt; &gt;to order one?
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; I wouldnt if i were you.
&gt; But if you want to it really is easy. A bit too easy. Take the device out. 
&gt; Take a pair of snips and cut the plunger off. Pull it out and cut it off. 
&gt; Thats it. Reinstall.


Where is the logic here? You wouldnt do it the correct way with a part
designed for just such a purpose but you would advise a kludge as a better
solution?
