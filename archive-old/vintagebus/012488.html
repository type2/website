And so our hero had come to roost. The pop top was never fixed. The
clutch exploded and was replaced in the rain behind the bike shop. The
throttle cable was fixed at the carb by crimping  the wire end to the
cable and the alligator teeth end of a test clip to the  barrel connecter
at 3:00 am so he could make it to his 5:30 job at the school cafeteria.
The test clip to the coil to replace the ignition &quot;on&quot; was still in use
and occasionally let the electrons run away  during class so that when
our forgetful zero er hero returned he had to push start it due to it
remaining clipped (his regular night parking plot was far enough away to
let the generator recruited new electrons on the way).The guys at the
plant nursery  were he worked tuesday and thursday all dug it. The dixie
chicks at the texaco/tacobell were he did his school work late at night
still write him letters to say that Ford is better than VW.
The semester came to it's close. Our hero made the deans's list ; his
study cards lined the dash in thick bundles. The local yokels pulled him
over for having California plates twice (&quot;yer goin too slow son, yer
libel to get runed over&quot;) and once behind the bike shop after a day of
Bus repairs while our hero was trying to get some much needed sleep.( he
told them to watch their language, guess our bible student is cranky when
disturbed ;-) five sheriffs and one vw freak; fair fight?)
As much fun as all this was our hero missed home so he swapped the westy
to a dope smoken long haired bike shop proprietor for a purple GT to take
on the plane.
Looking down the mountain to Yokahoma beach on the Kauokola/ Mokulaiea
ridge he didn't miss the Bus; he was home, he was working on his Bug and
the Kombi was still to come.
