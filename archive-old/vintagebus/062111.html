Subject: RE: [VB] H4s

No fuses!  No fuses!  That is just piss poor if you ask me.  Seriously what
were those VW so called engineers thinking on that one... Let me guess,
cheap.

As for the H4s being bright, I did not think they were that bright to get
the birdie wave from other cars :)  I am just trying to keep up with the
outrageously bright Zenon units everyone has these days.

Thanks,
Adrian S. Pillow

The parking lights aren't fused, seen many a smoked wire when the parking
light wire chaffs against the headlight bucket hole.

ps. Be prepared to get the finger a lot from people with your new
headlights. I have those in my DD (4 years now) and when in a caravan I am
made to drive lead because my lights blind those that would be ahead of me.
