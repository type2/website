Subject: PIP racks, aren't that great.
Date: Thu, 6 Aug 1998 11:26:03 -0700 

I've seen just about all of the different types of PIP racks, and they
really are not that good.
PIP's metal fabrication work is dead on but I've had several friends
whose racks ended up rusting after one week.  They use really crappy
galvanizing.  My original Westy rack has dents and scrapes all over it
and not one speck of rust, plus it's 35 years old and lived out side all
of it's life.  PIP's idea of wood is a joke.  Their oak is low grade
probably grade C wood.  You can't tell me you haven't seen a PIP rack
without warped slats on it.  It's not that hard to pick out the reject
lumber.  All of the Newbe racks i've seen had at least 3 warped slats.
It is a shame to have to wait months to get a rack that is below
standards.  Obviously PIP only cares about getting the big bucks from VW
and not passing on the resto tourch to another manufacture. 
Shoot, if I had the money I'd buy the rights to manufacture the repro
racks.  And, do a better job at it to boot.

Trust me, you are not missing out on much from PIP quiting production.
There are plenty of real racks still floating around.  And the effort
you put into restoring an original rack far outweighs the cost of a
repro PIP rack.  (if you can get one)
