Bob Scott was one of the pioneers in the Vintage VW industry.  He was an
incredibly nice guy and knew what he sold.  Now that he has passed away,
his son-in-law has taken over - another nice guy.

When I was a kid, my dad bought all kinds of stuff for his 23 window
restoration.  They are trustworthy.
