Subject: parts suppliers in Mountain View, CA

Hi guys,

Well I have arrived in CA. I decided against the Karmann Ghia. I looked at a
couple, and test drove them as well. I really like the look, but I am a bus
driver at heart. They didn't feel quite right to me.

I picked up a '69 single cab. Now I need to find a local supplier for some
basic parts. I was hoping that living in CA, I could find local parts
suppliers saving me my regular shipping costs... I was also hoping to pick
up some parts for my bus at home. 

Any suggestions or recommendations...

Thanks,

-Kevin
