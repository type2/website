Subject: Portable Propane Heater Warnings 
Date: Sun, 28 May 2000 01:06:09 -0700

All...

Recently on one of the Type 2 Lists a message was posted about a new propane
burning space heater [&quot;Mr. Heater Portable Buddy&quot;] which is supposedly safe
to use in enclosed spaces like pickup campers, vans, tents, etc..  Curious,
I went to the manufacturer's website to check it out.

The Mr. Heater website specifically states that because of new technology
the &quot;Portable Buddy&quot; heater is safe to use in enclosed spaces, and gives a
list of possible uses/applications.  Also on that website is a link to the
&quot;Coalition for Portable Propane Product Safety&quot;, an organization of propane
appliance manufacturers.

I followed the link to the Coalition's website, only to find a stern warning
against using ANY propane burning appliance in an enclosed space like a
camper, etc..

Puzzled by this contradiction, I returned to the Mr. Heater site and in
their &quot;comment&quot; space asked how they could make the safety claim for the
&quot;Portable Buddy&quot; unit in direct conflict with their own industry
organization.

This is an issue of particular interest to me, for two reasons.  Like all
Type 2 camper owners I'm always interested in supplemental heat sources that
can be used to extend the camping season.  Conversely, I've learned all too
often of folks who've died in their campers, tents, boats, etc. while using
various combustion devices as a heat source.

Apparently the Mr. Heater company passed my inquiry along to the Coalition.
A response I've just received from the Coalition is attached for your
perusal and edification.

Re: Coalition warning on the use of portable propane heaters in
enclosures.

We recently recieved a copy of your e-mail to Mr. Heater Corporation
regarding
your review of their Web page information on the Mr. Heater Portable
Buddy and its
recommended use for enclosures.

You also visited the Coalition's Web site where we specifically warn
against using
portable propane heaters inside enclosures, especially while sleeping
overnight.

Hopefully the following information will help you understand how this
possible
discrepency has eveolved.

First. The Mr. Heater Portable Buddy is not yet on the market. The
company is planning
production for August of 2000 and therefore units of this type will not
be available in stores
for purchase by consumers  until September at the earliest.

Second. The Mr. Heater Portable Buddy is the result of new technology
that has met
standards for heaters less than 12.000 BTU's that can be used in
outdoo/indoor recreational
applications including tents, truck caps ,RV's etc. The core of this
technology is an oxygen
depletion sensor (ODS)

These standards were established by the CSA (formerly American Gas
Association) in cooperation
with the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) and engineering
technical committees
that are comprised of representatives from each of the member companies
of the Coaltion
for Portable Propane Product Safety.

Third. There are still hundreds of thousands of small portable
propane-fueled radiant heaters between
3,000 and 12,000 BTU's  currently in the hands of consumers throughout
the US that do not feature
the ODS syste. Using these units in unventilated enclosures poses a
definite danger to the risk
of Cabon Monoxide (CO)poisoning that can cause injury or even death.
Acording to CPSC records,
a majority of CO incidents occured during the spring months in
situations where campers attempted to
sleep overnight in unventilated enclosures.(tents,truck caps, horse
trailers,etc.)

The Coalition for Portable Radiant Heater Safety was formed in 1996 to
work in cooperation with
the CPSC in conducting a nationwide consumer education program regarding
Carbon Monoxide
dangers associated with improper use of these products. The education
campaign was sanctioned
to raise consumer awareness while manufacturers developed new
technologies to provide a solution
that would enable small portable heaters to be used inside wtih small
one pond propane cylinders.
Presently Coleman, Mr. Heater and Century products have introduced
solutions.

Coleman's product is a small 3,000 BTU catalytic heater called the Black
Cat. The Century product
is not yet on the market.

Portable propane fueled heaters with or without an ODS need an ample
supply of fresh air to operate.
Adding an ODS makes these products safer. In fact,  even heaters without
an ODS will operate properly
in a tent or cabin when there is plently of circulating air that will
replace the inside air frequently.

In 1996, the Coalition recognized that with so many variables involved,
it was in the best interest of the
consumer to warn against using these devices in any type of enclose ---
especially while sleeping
overnight. Even with these new products entering the marketplace, they
are still fuel burning appliances
that use some form of combustible flame to generate heat.Thus Coaltion's
position today is
to warn not to use thes products inside without an adequate air supply
and especially while sleeping.

The manufacturers that are members of the Coaltion will be meeting this
June to address these very issues
that you pointed out. We are aware of them and thank you for your
interest in bringin them to our attention.

Best regards,

Dennis Pavan

Representative
Coalition for Portable Propane Product Safety.
