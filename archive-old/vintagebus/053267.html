&lt;&lt; Vintage price lists for just about anything....
Some that I loked at over the past year seem to be pretty close to what
the market is paying...be sure and check out the price for a cherry 1967
21 window deluxe.  $$$$$$$$$$

Cheers, dave &gt;&gt;

That price is for an &quot;original&quot; 21 window deluxe. Unless you can find one in
a time capsule, I doubt that you could restore one to that condition for the
price. Matching numbers count when you're dealing with the big bucks - The
competition at these levels creates some &quot;interesting&quot; mini industries...
Like custom manufacturer's id plates to match #'s to existing equipment.
'Vettes and other muscle cars are notorious for this...Though I doubt that
interest or pricing on VW has reached that level yet. 
As a rough guide to cost, you might consider what it would cost for some-
one like MetWiz to &quot;just&quot; remove the body without any repairs...
