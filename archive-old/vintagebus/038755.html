Lost my diagram I drew up so I wouldn't have to remember how to hookup my
outlet. I have one each Black, Green and White wires in the harness and the
outlet has terminals at 12 o'clock, 2 and 7 o'clock. Since the fourth of
July is a month off, I'd like to get this right the first time. Anyone know
where my wires go?

Thanks!
Everett Rein
