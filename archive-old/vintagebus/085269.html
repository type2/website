Subject: Re: [VB] Running hot

Is it running hot on the street or on the highway? Or both? The small nut is 
1.38:1 the big nut is 1.26:1? At any rate the small nut RGB's are a lower 
gear ratio =  higher highway revs.

You can't see a fan belt slip, just make sure that the belt tension is good.

You say you have the dog house cooler. Did you get the wider fan to go with 
it?

Chris




 I think it's running hot because the dip stick and distributor are burning 
me when I touch them.  I haven't had one burn that hot before.

 I am running a new rancho freeway flyer tranny with rebuilt small nut 
reduction boxes

 I do have a dog house system

 haven't noticed my my fan belt slipping.  I think I am tuned well.

 I had it tuned at reputable aircooled only shop.

 Any idea's?  Do you know the gearing difference in the small nut verses big 
nut Reduction boxes


 Thanks for the help!

 Richard
