Subject: Kristen Laurite - AIRS

Remember the push for AIRS membership
when this tragedy occurred?
If you are there, have you checked your
information for current correct status?
I joined, and was pleasantly called upon for
assistance only once, but it is a tremendous
resource. It is reassuring to be part of a
large community of bus travelers who can
provide access to services in their local
area which I might not be aware of or be
able to find easily.
You do not need to be a mechanic or have
a barn full of parts.
It is a larger statement than flashing
the peace sign at passing strangers.
