I think the first order of business is that the frames MUST fit first.  I looked at a very nice deluxe parked next to me at KP and noticed that there was at least an 1/8th to 1/4 inch gap at the upper right corner of one of the REPO safari windows.  I don't care what type of rubber you stuff in there...its gonna leak!  Get a frame that fits!  Original are a better bet.
