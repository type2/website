Same nose damage as on my old 61 single, I drilled a hole in the headlight
bucket, put a stout hook in it, hooked up the chain to my hoist and let the
momentum of the bus rolling backwards slowly pull it out, then i welded
(tacked) a piece of 1/8 by 1 inch strap across the crease and repeated the
operation. After that the nose was out enough to use the nail gun to pull it
out the rest of the way. Total time start to finished nose 4 1/2 hours

O.K.
Heres a few photos of what I need to repair.
Bumped pretty good on the headlight.
Bucket itself it shifted a bit back.
The floor is not damaged and the metal inner panel is not messed up (Id like

to keep it that way)
Anyone have thoughts of how i should fix this!????

I have a spitznagel (nail gun) but I dont think thats strong enough to yank 
it out.
Thanks!
Greg
