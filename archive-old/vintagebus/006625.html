Everett and the list, I know of 1 of these buses for sale in Iowa, I have
been thinking of buying it, the only problem it comes with a 67 single cab
also, the owner, 72 years old thinks it's worth a lot more then me. I have
pic's somewhere in my mailbox and if I can find them I'll forward them to
you.

Subject: [VB] Side-loader single cab


I was wondering if anyone has any information about the so-called
&quot;side-loader&quot; Single Cab.

This is a Single Cab where the toolchest door and the front 1/2 of a side
gate were merged into a door that folded down, similar to the rear of an
Ambulance Bus.  The front 1/2 of the bed was also cut out.

I've heard this was not a factory conversion.

Pictures are welcome!

Thank you,
Everett Barnes
