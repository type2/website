I put a few on www.thesamba_dot_com too. Search on my last name, Houck to find 'em. 
Ev, you can put my pics in your show section if you want. Thanks for getting the good side of my '63 DC and its newly installed hoops. I cut about 4&quot; off the bay top slats to make 'em fit. 

The LHD, left side cargo doors standard was interesting. It had 4 add-on vents in the passenger area, 2 in the roof and 2 in the doors. I see that there are only two pop-out windows, in the back. 

The return trip to Fresno trip was wet to say the least. My safaris don't just leak, they suck! Water dripping on my shoes, splashing on the panels, pooling in the tray and shorting out the stereo. Shouldn't complain, the Grapevine pass was shut down later that evening, trapping scores of trucks and a busload of kids.Both Karl and I hydroplaned a few times. It scared Karl in his mal-aligned '67 standard so much he dropped down to 60 mph for a few miles. My DC has wide tires, ball joints, disc brakes and CVs. 

The Fresno Tower District Mardi Gras parade is on Sunday the 25th. Pmail me for info and join the party.
