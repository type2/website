Subject: oil pump question

does anyone know of a reason why NOT to use a flat cam/ &quot;AK&quot; oil pump in a
dual relief engine case? it will be single port, non-doghouse oil cooler,
so i can't see a reason why it would be bad. both the suction and pressure
holes are the same size in the case and pump, and they line up fine.
vw says in one of their service books to &quot;never use an earlier oil pump
with a late engine&quot; (bentley 68-79 type 2 official sevice manual), but i
reasoned that to mean that the &quot;AK&quot; oil pump is too short to reach a dished
cam and the gear wouldn't engage the cam and thus provide no oil pressure.
i also think i have used a flat cam/&quot;AK&quot; combo in a dual relief case
before, but i cannot be 100% sure.
thoughts? suggestions?
