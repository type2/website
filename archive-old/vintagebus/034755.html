Hi Casey,
Have you hooked up the warm air tube to the air cleaner?  Do you have the 
thermostatic bellows/flap system in place?  Could also be that you need to 
clean the carb.  More than once have had a pearl of gunk build inside the 
carb to shut down the engine suddenly.  Though for us these appeared in the 
main jet itself.  Eric&amp;Barb
