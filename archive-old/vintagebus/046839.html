&lt;&lt; It looks like I'll be taking a quick work-related trip to Germany in the

next couple of weeks.

Are there any listees in Frankfort? I'd very much enjoy the opportunity to

meet someone familiar with the bus scene there. Also...what VW sites should

I visit during my free time?

I'll be arriving on a Sunday and staying 2 - 3 days.

thanks in advance

John,

I don't live in Frankfurt but will be there 9/29-10/4.

If you're there during the Auto Show, make sure you get a chance to see it.
