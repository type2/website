&gt;According to the 63-67 Bentleys, the welded end torsion bars are the
&gt;replacement for the separate leaf bars. Separate leaf bars were to be
&gt;used until stocks ran out, but the welded end bars were preferred.

I can't find where the Bentley says that.  On V-6 4 it mentions that the
non-welded bars can only be used with the torsion arms with sealing
washers, 211 405 103 A andd 211 405 153 A, and says the welded bars will
remain available.  It does kind of imply that the welded bars are a
&quot;universal&quot; replacement.

The '67 parts list at the doc project lists those two torsion arm part
numbers as fitting from the first '64 models on up, and only lists one
part number for the torsion bar.  I can't find a note involving 
supercession of the torsion bar part number in the Supplements at the
beginning of the parts list.  I would assume that the part number it
gives is for the welded end bar.  Maybe somebody with an earlier copy
of the parts list can check.
