&gt; a company that has a reputation of good rubber products?  Also, who
&gt; makes the best safari windows?

Izzy's has the best windows - don't waste your time or money with 
the bus boys or wolfgang crap.  If I recall, Izzy's are a few $$
cheaper, but I could be wrong.

WCM has OK rubber.  The quality on some stuff, like door rubber bumpers,
has declined drastically.  Wolfsburg West has good stuff too.
