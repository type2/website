Subject: Re: enough Hoover

&gt;Message text written by &quot;Michele Putman&quot;
&gt;&gt; He must
&gt;have been having a bad day that day too.  Too bad someone who could be
&gt;such a huge resource to us has to act like the VW God.
&gt;
&gt;        At the risk of being ousted by the many &quot;Hoover-Followers&quot;, I will
&gt;be brave and stand up and agree with Rick and Michele.  Though Mr. Hoover
&gt;has been a super tremendous asset to V-dubbers as a whole, I am rather
&gt;disgusted with his belittling remarks.

    I've never seen or heard Robert Hoover act like anything approaching
    a &quot;VW God&quot; and strongly disagree with anyone who feels that way.

    Make that *very* strongly disagree.

    I would say that anyone with something negative to say about
    Robert has

    a) never met him

    or

    b) stepped on his toes expecting everyone in the world to treat them
        the way their mommies treated them. do YOU suffer fools gladly?

    Sigh. A real bad turn. A grateful lot, are you?
