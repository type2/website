Subject: RE: [VB] how to know if its the transaxle?

Hey Thomas,

Before you go and put in new tranny mounts, go under the back axle by the 
gear reduction boxes and tighten up all the bolts on the trailing arm(is 
that what its called).  There should be like 4 19mm boltes by each rear 
wheel.  I had the same prob and put in new polyurethane mounts with no 
solution...then months late doing a valve adjustment I noticed slack (finger 
tight!!!) in all those bolts....prob completely fixed!
