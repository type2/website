Hi Scott and others,
It would be interesting to have that deluxe soda blasted, replace all missing 
and weak sheet metal, and then taken to a zinc plating shop to be acid dipped 
and then zinc plated.  Probably would be smoother to have it electroplated 
than hot dipped.  Then light sanding to rid it of any runs and give the 
primer a grip on the zinc, and painting.  This would insure that all of the 
rust insde would be cleaned off and the bare clean metal covered.  The 
problem with only using water to wash out the soda and not acid and zinc 
afterward is that any rusted or bare metal in areas blasted would just rust 
up and come back to haunt one through the paint later.  Plus this would get 
into cracks and crannies that you would not be able to get paint into without 
dipping the whole body.  At the very least this should be looked into for 
doors, hatches, and truck gates since all of these body parts rust out from 
the inside out.   Eric&amp;Barb
