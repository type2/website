DONT FORGET ABOUT ME PULLING UP IN THE FRANKENSTANDARD AT 5A.M.!!!!
5AM and I STILL heard the clown yelling!
I don't know his name.......but I could pick him out of a lineup.
Classic thing I remember happening at Sacramento Bug O' Rama.....
Guy had a NEW OLD STOCK Pressed rear bumper....
He took it and smacked it against his head......FOLDED it in half.
Alright, now I admit not getting much sleep.....he might have folded it over 
his leg or something.
I think it was his head though!!!!!!
His bus also has no side windows.....and safaris kicked ALL the way 
open......he drove the entire way to Jerome like that!
DAAAAAAAAAMN!!!!!!!!!

&lt;&lt;It's because of him that I will never go to bed at
Jerome ever again, sober or otherwise. Thom has a
picture of this &quot;Rubber Johnny&quot; moron on his website.
I think that the &quot;Shock the Monkey&quot; K loop was between
12 and 2:00. It was the endless yelling of
&quot;Dubewe,Dubewe,Bub-daewe Social Disease Foreveryone
dot com!&quot; that went on between 2:00 and 4:00. Things
quieted up to some degree between 4:00 and 7:00AM with
Kyle, Joe Ginter and I standing in his face during
that time. His buddy took another hit of whatever it
was and climbed the talus slope (rock hill) and tried
to ride the rocket. &quot;Rubber Johnny&quot; decided to totally
harrass and attempt to intimidate my family thereafter
by sarcastically commenting on our every movement. If
Mr. Noble does really know this person's real name
please send it to America's Most Stupid so they can
put out an All Points Bulletin.
Drum Circle my butt. Tom Bodett has the lights left on
for me.
