Subject: gas cap gasket
Mime-Version: 1.0
X-MIME-Autoconverted: from quoted-printable to 8bit by lenti.type2_dot_com id RAA62185

For about the past month or so I have noticed a stronger than normal smell fo
gas coming from my bus, I am not sure if it is becasue I am runnign the heat
more often or not, but I think that gas is coming back up the filler tube and
leaking down the side of the bus whenever I take a turn over 5mph. (I noticed
some streaking of some fluid on the side of the bus)

Anyway I was looking at my gas cap...I believe it is an original cap. It is
vented, and locking(although I never need the key to take it off) Anyway the
rubber gasket on it is pretty beat up, is it possible to just get a new gasket
and slide it on?
