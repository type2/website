Subject: Re: [VB] dual battery wiring

The el'cheapo way I did it with my old 66 westy, was a $20 30amp relay from
a camping store. Ran a 10ga. wire from the positive from the first battery
to the terminal on the relay, then the same with the other battery to the
other terminal. The third terminal ran to the + side of the coil.

When the key was off, both batteries were seperate. The second battery
supplied power for all the interior lights, and things used while camping,
the first battery was used for the other 'normal' stuff. If I ran my
secondary battery dead, I could turn the key and start the bus so that both
batteries charged while driving around.

It was cheap, and worked great.  I've never tried using the battery
isolators and have no word on how well those work.
