I no longer deign to work on the s/c with the Bentley. I now have an OG VW

Reparatur-Leitfaden Volkswagen-Transporter 1963 mit addendum. I will ONLY

work on my bus auf Deutsch, as I feel the repairs are much more authentic

that way. In fact, when using my Schraubenzieher, Schl ssel, und Zangen I

try to curse ONLY auf Deutsch, and then go to my local Rathskellar to have

a lager.

To be  u erst korrekt, you MUST arbeit auf Deutsch... but I'm sure the

Bentley is fine for you Cal look types!!


[F]  :)      Except the part about finding a German Vw repair manual. VERY 
cool!

70 Neunsitzer

65 Pritschenwagen

I had aquired a copy of the  VW type II options and coachwork variations,  
which has pages dated from 65 through 67.  VERY VERY VERY cool book, lots of 
SO options, such as SO1- the VW-Verkaufswagen (sales flap for food venders) 
etc etc and it is al auf Deutsch

It also contains the first evidence  I have had that support the rumor that 
65s came with mismatched bumper- it does have a pic of a camper with a 
slanted front and a pointed rear bumper

dont you wish you had a VW -kombi mit Berkefeld-Trinkwasserbereiter Typ 19 
690?

Or perhaps a VW-Kastenwagen mit ausfahrbarer Leichmetall-Leiter is more your 
style.

  I think SO 15, the Pritschenwagen mit hydraullischer Kippeinrichtung looks 
very useful.
