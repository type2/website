All I have to say is that I FREAK OUT when I get crappy customer service. I
am so sick and tired of people who I am buying something from treating me as
if they are doing me a favor by consenting to take my cash.

I paid a couple of thousand dollars recently for some furniture and when I
went to pick it up ( I called, they said it was ready)  the guy at the
counter started huffing and puffing saying things like &quot; who told you this
stuff would be ready?  didn't you know that we haven't unpacked the truck
yet? *whine, whine, b_tch b_tch...&quot; I'm sure my blood pressure went into the
stratosphere, I talked to managers, I called the owner, I got apologies. The
point is, there are plenty of other vendors out there, there is no reason to
put up with this dooky. Just like the local VW parts place guy who, after I
told him I was doing a complete resto on a '62 standard tried to convince me
that I could turn it into a deluxe by just drilling dome holes and
installing the chrome trim he just happened to have hanging on his wall. Is
this guy some kind on an idiot? how does he stay in business? I would assume
the guy would be thinking resto eh? that's gonna a take a lot of time and
parts, I better get to know this guy and help him out if I can... instead he
sells me a 40 HP muffler with the wrong installation kit and mis-matched
wrong year parts-- trying to make a quick buck instead of cultivating future
sales. I'm NEVER buying another part from this place unless I'm desperate,
can't wait, and know exactly what I need.

Whoo, I'm all a-tither.. better pop a nitro tablet and try to mellow out...
