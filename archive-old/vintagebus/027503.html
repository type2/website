&gt;  Worse news than the cam gear, but it's fixable.

Possible, I suppose, since I only removed the left cover, but it seems
like it would try to fire on the other side. BTW, after looking closely
at a few cams at work today, I'm supposing that the cam itself could
have broken close to the gear... I'm guessing when the cam let go, it
must have settled into a position where none of the valves were hitting
(I didn't hear any kind of crunchy noises when it let go), but not
completely shut... I'll keep everyone posted when I find out what
happened...

I've opened up some trashed cases and watched a few being rebuilt, but
this will be the first that I've rebuilt myself. I'll have my boss watch
over my shoulder, so I feel pretty confident it will be fixed right the
first time...
