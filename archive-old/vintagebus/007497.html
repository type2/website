It just crossed my mind tonight that my friend Zac in Omaha related to me a
story last October when I went to visit him and his wife.  He told me that
in a junkyard around the Omaha area, there was a BAYwindow Westy sitting in
a junkyard.  I'm sketchy on the details but for some reason, Zac knew this
was a Westy that someone personally had imported to the states.  Zac told me
that he pulled the headliner down (the plysheets you find in Westies) and
there in the roof were the imprints/molds of a 21 window bus complete with
sunroof imprint all in factory paint.  He couldn't believe his eyes nor did
he expect anyone to ever believe him (I do) but I was wondering if maybe VW
had some old stock leftover and just went ahead and got rid of it on a bus
bound to be a Westy?  I know Bays are wider than a splitty but are the roofs
different in size?  Maybe VW was attempting a prototype of this style for
their Baywindows, when stricter regulations or changes in design wouldn't
let them pursue it.

At any rate, it's a neat story and one I'll never forget.

If you're on here Zac, fill us in on the details...
