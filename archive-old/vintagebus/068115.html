Subject: Re: [VB] dual 34 PICT

I tried to get that 46mm nut off my 67 Bus  with NO success.  Long breaker
bar,with cheater bar, had no effect.  I brought it over to a shop with an
air
driven socket and he got it right off.  I let him do the rear brakes, as
that big nut needs to go back on equally tight.

&gt; Speaking of the SC, anyone have any difficulty getting the big 46mm axle
nut
&gt; loose for doing brakes? Have had the fronts on since last winter but
really
&gt; need to do the rear. The rock under the wheel, even with the emergency on,
&gt; isn't a viable way to park!
