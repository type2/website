What I was saying is that I have all the later ('64) brake hardware: backing 
plates, cylinders, shoes, drums, everything.  I have been told that if I use 
all of these later parts, I should have no problem mounting them on my 
earlier spindles but will have to use the bearings out of the earlier drums 
that are on the vehicle now.  This is just what I have been told and have yet 
to try it.  I do have another early ('62) complete beam that I can try it on 
first.  If/when I get around to it, I will post to let all know the results.
