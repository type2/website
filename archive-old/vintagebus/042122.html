&gt; This morning's exchange about VW keys has been interesting. My '67 requires
&gt; two keys, one for the ignition and most of the doors, another for the
&gt; passenger side cargo door. The engine lid has a locking latch, but no key.
&gt; 
&gt; Is it possible to get them all singing in the same key? Who is the key
&gt; person to contact?

Any good locksmith can take care of your cargo door.  It took the guy who
did mine about 4 hours and he'd never worked on one before. (hmm. he was
down the street from my dads house in Kansas City..I can dig his card up
if you are in the area.)

The engine lid handle uses a different style of key. The smith should be
able to cut you a new key for it without much problem.

(cost me twenty bucks for a bunch of keys copied (he went home to his
basement to find me some blanks for my steering column lock! I hadnt found
anyone else who had any!!), plus reworking the cargo door lock.)
