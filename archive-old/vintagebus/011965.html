Subject: Excessive Steering Play
Date: Thu, 29 Oct 1998 14:34:05 EST

Am going to work on the suspension this weekend and after the king pin 
replacement I will try to correct about 8 inches of play in the 
steering. The drag link is spent and instead of replacing the whole 
thing ($40 RMM) I found some tie rod ends here in town for $8/ea. Just 
replacing these should take care of this, right??

Thanks,
