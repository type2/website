&gt; So what's with the 'closed' skylight sections visible
&gt; on the interior shots?  Is this how they did sunroof
&gt; standard barns from factory?
&gt;
&gt; ????????????

&gt;
&gt; p.s. looks very crusty in the roof, where the
&gt; roof clips onto the body.  This is very very very
&gt; difficult to repair if the rust has moved through
&gt; the u section in which the roof sits....
