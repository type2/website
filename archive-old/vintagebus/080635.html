Subject: Re: [VB] Start Button in Engine Compartment

&gt; I used this in my 65 westy, which over a few years developed a hard start
&gt; probelm which became progressively worse and eventually untenable.   since I
&gt; installed a new starter it has always started with key.  why didn't I do that
&gt; ages 
&gt; ago?   dunno.  not hard to swap starters
&gt;
I agree w/ Clara. I travel long distances in the DC in the desert heat &amp; had
hard start problems until we put a new starter in, then never had the
problem again.
