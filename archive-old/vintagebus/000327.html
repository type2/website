I'm afraid that I have to disagree about the theory that the tags were made a 
week ahead.  As I said in an earlier post, I have the direct knowledge of 2 
busses made in '59 and two busses from '67 that have subsequent days listed 
on the tags, and the numbers correspond to the dates.  I can't explain why an 
earlier date would have a later number, however.
