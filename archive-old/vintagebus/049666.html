Subject: shifterknob noise

just had a looong roadtrip with the newly-nosed tranny, and on the return
had an interesting change: the shifter lever began to rattle.
not as in, loose, but as in i suspect the knob was acting as a sounding
board for vibration IN the shaft. my theory is that something - the spring
below the boot, a missing tooth in the tranny, whatever - is causing the
shaft and/or shift lever to vibrate, and the knob is a megaphone; grabbing
the assembly quiets it, as does gently moving the lever around. noise seems
to be worse when NOT under load.

ONLY other time I have experienced this was a uhaul 21footer that drove me
crazy with the rattle for 300 miles. shifted fine, tho.

any other listees have a comment on this phenom??
