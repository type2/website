&gt; the engine i picked up is 2110    its got a couterwighted 82 mm crank it is

Hi Joe,
Definitely go with FI then.  Any type 4 bus owner of 1800 or larger engine 
will tell you for daily driving it is the only way to go.  Eric's dad had a 
dual carbed 1800cc type 4 bus and it was nothing but trouble needing constant 
fiddling to get the carbs to work at all.  The 1977 Riviera camper with 2 
liter engine and FI was a dream for Eric's mom with plenty of torque for the 
hills.  We recently inherited the 1977 Riviera camper and all it needs is a 
new FW seal and clutch degrease or replacement after 15+ years of being 
driven hard and getting minimum maintance.
  Having such a big engine will probably require a special built tranny in 
your DC to keep things from coming apart in there and higher gearing to take 
advantage of the increased torque.
Eric&amp;Barb
