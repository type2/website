Subject: Re: [VB] Steam Clean an Engine?

If you do run a cleaner through your engine, do change the oil a couple 
hundred miles after wards, w/o heavy driving in that time.   sludge broke loose 
inside can clog things up.  Just like with a motor that sat for years.

I do a pressure wash every so often to keep the engine and compartment clean, 
to aid cooling of the engine and make it pleasanter to work on,

A very clean engine does get start to corrode on the outside (white stuff) on 
the case.  Well, it happened to my bug, nothing major, but I spray the case 
w/ liquid wrench after cleaning as it gets and stays too clean.  (Bet you never 
heard that one before)

 All that greasy build up on your engine outer surface makes your engine
 run hotter and will harbor enough oil to give you eternal little oil
 drips.
 Greasy, oily build up in your engine bay is a fuel for a fire if you ever
 have a fuel leak that ignites.
 A good general rule is that cleaner is better in almost all situations.
