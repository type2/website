(ok, since this is &quot;what I did on presidnet's day&quot; day)

I got the '60 a lot closer to paint.  I cleaned the engine compartment,
cleaned misc mouse goo off the front seat pedestal, sanded theinsides of 
the cargo doors, spot-puttied and sanded misc boo-boos around the bus,
detailed and painted the wheel wells, replaced the right front floor,
took the airbox apart, sanded the airbox intake area, you get the 
picture...

Last night I spent 3 hours and countless pieces of sandpaper sanding the
roof.  Folx, please don't use house paint on your bus...  Then
I primered the roof, and re-primered the areas where I'd done the body work.

Tonight I will be doing a couple more rounds of inspect-fill-sand, then
start blocking out the bus.  I'm using a filling primer, which sands
down very nice.  Kinda like a spray-on thin bondo!

The CE safaris still aren't here.  Hopefully they will be soon, so I
can get them installed before I paint.
