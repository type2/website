Subject: Re: [T2] DM revisited was Windshield Runaround (misdirected e-mail)

Oops.

I replied to a T2 thread on the splitty list, $189 for bay glass is about
right or maybe $30 higher... 

and on a bay, I probably would spring for PPG or german glass as it is
a curved windshield and the wrong curve could make installation difficult
and cracks develop later on, if not when you try to put it in!

but, I still think tempered windscreen glass is E-vil.

take care,

Steve

&gt; Hello all,
&gt; 
&gt; I generally dont post on here much anymore, but this one made me do it.
&gt; 
&gt; I'm sorry but the only reason to have the german glass is because you are
&gt; a resto-purist. All laminated windshield glass must meet the same
&gt; standards, get glass that has a safety compliance logo on it and you are
&gt; all set.
&gt; 
&gt; $189 for a bus windshield is crazy! but, i'm not a resto purist.  Sure if
&gt; I ran into good OG glass I wouldnt hit it with a hammer, but wow, $189.
&gt; 
&gt; But, then again, there are people on this list that put creative
&gt; engineering safaris in their bus, keep the tempered glass, and drive it.
&gt; I'd say that shows a complete lack of brains, but thats me. There is a
&gt; RESAON that no new cars have tempered windshields, they are a dumb idea.
&gt; 
&gt; Basically, I dont get people risking a face/nose/eye/mouth full of glass
&gt; cubes at high velocity, and I dont get paying $189 for OG glas.
&gt; 
&gt; ah well, guess im just not up with the times...
&gt; 
&gt; take care,
&gt; 
&gt; Steve
