Looked at what was I think a post '58 Binz today(rear door opens like a
&gt; VW factory DC.  Its said to be the old Dean Lowery shop truck.  The rear
&gt; seat was on a &quot;stand&quot; like, but not identical to VW DC's.  It was of
&gt; ribbed sheet metal construction like the bulkhead is made of.  Is this
&gt; correct for a Binz?  I thought they came with seats that had a frame and
&gt; mounted to the floor.
