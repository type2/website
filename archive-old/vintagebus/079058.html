&gt;
&gt; Is it possible to remove and replace the outer races of the front wheel
&gt; bearings in a 67 (roller bearings) without using a hydraulic press?
&gt; Bentley and Muir seem to say no, but I was wondering if anyone had other
&gt; ideas...
&gt;
&gt;

Well I didn't even look at the Bentley or Muir for this - just did them as I 
would any bearing of that type.

Use a brass drift to knock the old race out, and used that old race as a 
drift to knock the new one in.  Don't think I had to even grind the edges of 
the bearing to ensure it didn't get stuck because of the easy access

Is it bad to do this then?

Paul
