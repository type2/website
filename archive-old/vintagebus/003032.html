  Finally got the full coverage insur. on the 63 panel. Went through Farmers
and there antique private passenger automobile insur. Here is how they
classify the auto;

&quot;Any vehicle over 25 years old classified and rated as a private passenger
automobile which is maintained solely for use in exhibitions, club
activities, parades and other functions of public interest, and which is not
used primarily for transportation of passengers over any public street or
highway and has been restored to, or maintained in the original condition,
shall be classified as an &quot; antique automobile&quot; and may be insured at the
following rates&quot;

There are 3 different rates depending on your other coverage's ( multi auto,
accident free, non smoker, ect)

Then states;

&quot;Antique automobiles may be insured for physical damage coverage's on a
Stated Amount basis only. The amount of insur written may not be less than
100% of the value of the automobile.&quot;

Thats it.

Gave them the appraisal from UJ and got the bus insured for $9300 with $500
deductible. Cost is $157.63 every 6 months. The nice thing on the coverage
is the no miles driven limit and no limit to number of events you can go to.
With this coverage I would be covered if going to and from an event back
east both ways, also going to weekly or even biweekly club meetings. Covered
for Jerome this week, Phoenix the next, Buses and Balloons 2 weeks later
ect. Also covered while going to or from a repair shop to prep bus for a
show. There are alot of other companys out there ( J C Taylor, ect ) but
most won't cover you for so may miles and events. Anyway this is what I went
with.

See ya in Jerome
