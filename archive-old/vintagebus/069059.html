&gt; A well written letter expressing your feelings about their product and
&gt; the fact that their bad design on a part (the collet) of that tool just
&gt; might get you a free part or even a free tool (express your dismay at
&gt; the tools failure and your uncertainty at purchasing another from them)!

It might be better not to threaten to avoid their product, but to express
your great surprise that their product failed in the way it did:

&quot;I've never had a lick of trouble with a Milwaukee product, but this
one cracked in half.  What could be the problem?&quot;
