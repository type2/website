Subject: Fw: [VB] selling vws

The BEST place to sell your VW buses is Japan.
But i think there is also a shortage of good buses
in Afghanistan. ( as well as roads ).
Have you considered this list as a market?
Over here on the right coast we really enjoy the
rust-free sweet cheap deals we see constantly
advertised in the most unaccessable places.
Like California and Arizona.
