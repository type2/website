&gt;   I have a question for those who have fought with the DMV to get a Title
&gt;  change when the owner can't find one or it was in the original owners name
&gt;  then he bought it without putting it in his name and then it sat for 13
&gt;  years. When I ask the DMV to whom it belongs they say that the name that I
&gt;  gave them (the seller) is not on the Title. The owner doesn't appear to be
&gt;  all there but his room mates that live with him say he has had this bus for
&gt;  a long time but doesn't have the money to fix it up. What can I do he
&gt;  basically gave me the bus and told me that when he gets the pink slip out 
of
&gt;  his storage when he finds it I can give him the money. I would really like
&gt;  to get started on it but I don't want to do that until it is in my name.
&gt;  

yes, don't put work/ money into it until you have the paperwork.
I bought a bus from a guy who lost the title, but as he was owner of record 
it was okay.  SOunds you have no papertrail.  THe guy has to get you the 
papers, for it to be yours.  In wa state you can get an abandoned vehicle 
title, which involves a state inspection, and a small fee, and you get a 
'temporary' title for three years, in which the 'real' owner can come reclaim 
the vehicle, though has to pay for repairs etc (if you have receipts) after 
three years it is yours cleeear.  But I don't know the rules for your state, 
and I heard the WA rules were changing.
