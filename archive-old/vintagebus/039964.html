Jim:
C'mon and spend a work day with me if you believe us Government Mules don't 
work hard for short money.  A half day at work for me is a 12 hour day.  
C'mon and live the life before you start putting it down.  Walt's in the 
Army so I can't speak for that branch, but my guys and I do 12 hour days 
24x7x365.25, when I have the command calls it's 24 hour on call works out 
usually to 20 hour days for a week at a time (yes, Saturday and Sunday too).

Bus content:  Had to fix a DPO rewire job after having to be towed for the 
first time.  A blob of solder on the insulation and a wrap of tape over the 
mess does not guarantee a good connection.  Hard as hell to find in the dark 
too!
