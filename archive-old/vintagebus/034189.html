Subject: A public plea to Dawn and Richard of PLF...

I really didn't want to have to go public with this... but there are times
when you have to ask friends for help.

I don't want to detail the whole saga at this point.  I'll sum it up... I am
getting married this Saturday in Las Vegas, yey!  Dawn, it has been since
before Jerome that I paid over $700 cash for a Split-window Double Cab
tilt... I have asked for a refund since Middle December... in both writing
and via acquaintances verbally.  I even talked directly to Richard at the
end of January.

I have been unable to reach or contact Dawn or Richard since the end of
January...

I need the money or something of value that I can convert into money :)  A
perfect new tilt would be nice.  Heck, I'd even take 2 perfect 1967 Westy
poptop canvases combined with cash (I need a westy poptop canvas and could
surely sell the second or keep it).  I know the Truck tilts are the most
difficult... but it has been over 4 months since I formally asked for a
refund.

If anyone can in any ay assist with getting this message to them and
encouraging them to resolve this issue before my wedding date, I'd really
appreciate it.

Thank you,
