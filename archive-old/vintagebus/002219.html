Subject: What motor is in this thing?

I've gotten pretty good at identifying busses by what they look like from
the outside, but need help at figuring out what motor is in the bus I bought
a few weeks ago.  Anyone know of a link(s) I could try until I can get some
pictures posted?  This I do know, It's in a 65, looks alot like the 1600 in
my 71, but has dual Kadron's and a fram oil filter.

Please excuse the ignorance, and laziness, go ahead have a laugh, but if I
get caught crawling under it again when I'm supposed to be &quot;taking out the
trash&quot;, I'm going to be living in it in the driveways of various AIRS
members throughout the Northeast for the rest of the summer.

hmmm...actually...
