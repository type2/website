Subject: loaf to splitty front beam

I have never done this swap but I have un-done one. The problems are that
the beam makes the bus ride higher and also it is wider. This means that if
you put on adapters to get the wide 5 hole pattern you are really wide in
the front. The adjustable front idea is nice but spendy and time consuming.
I would just go through your drum brakes and figure out why they aren't
working right. They will not compare to the stopping power of disks, but
should be plenty to stop the weight of a splitty. You could probably buy
all new brake components for the price it would cost to swap the front beam
properly.
