Subject: RE: Non-Stock Muffler and Engine Temp

This is FANTASTIC!! actual, real results!!... i am into tuning turbo 
vehicles using dyno's and there are so many little things that can change 
their performance. and as far as this list is concerned there are SOOOOOO 
many different opinions as to what is right and what isn't, it will be 
really nice to finally have info backed up by Ronnie's data logging instead 
of what someones brothers, cousins, great-uncle's bus runs!

HATS OFF TO RONNIE FOR SPENDING ALL THE TIME IT TAKES TO SET-UP, RUN, LOG, 
CHANGE PARTS, SET-UP, RUN, LOG.... and on and on and on!

I cant wait for the info!

&gt;    The next engine going on the dyno will be a 1679, 69X88 cut-ins. This
&gt;engine will have stock (new) single port heads, CW crank, balanced etc and 
&gt;a
&gt;30 pict 1 carb. One of the things we are going to do on this test is try a
&gt;stock exhaust, a 1 3/8 header and a 1 1/2 inch header. We will moniter the
&gt;engine heat with different exhaust as well as the change in HP and torque.
&gt;    The goal is to see exactly what difference the exhaust will make with
&gt;temps and hp on this engine.
