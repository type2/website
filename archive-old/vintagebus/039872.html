As was posted to the list, if they are the same code series, they can be 
rekeyed to match.  I don't have any in stock right now, as I sold all I had 
earlier this spring.  If you do find them, look at the codes on them.  If 
the letters are the same, they can be rekeyed to match.  It generally can be 
done in one day, plus shipping time.  If you are going to rechrome, we 
should take the plugs out and keep these parts aside, then rekey and 
reassemble after the plating.  Feel free to pmail if you have any other 
questions.
