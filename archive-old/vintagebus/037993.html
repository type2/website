Dawn completed my order in the time she said it would take to make a square 
window pop top for my 67 Westy. After the 5th week I sent her a note via US 
postal service and received my tent.

Just goes to show you that sometimes you get lucky or you just get what you 
want, when you want it.

Thanks Dawn! Long live PLF.

Virge
67 Westy
