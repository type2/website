Subject: waving /greetings

I think that if I lived on the left coast where there
is an abundance of ACVWs I perhaps would not wave but
in the midwest when you see one you get excited and
always wave.  That is what makes it odd in Ohio not to
wave but in CA it is no big thing.

When I first bought my New Beetle in 1999 it was still
a novelty and there were not so many on the road so
all NB drivers would wave at me.  Now there are so
many I dont even pay attention.  Once in awhile you
see kids punching each other but no one seems to pay
attention anymore so it may be time to trade it in on
a new Passat.  (Hot looking blondes in NBs I still
wave at, however)  :-)
