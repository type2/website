&lt;&lt; the cam (3 bolt) has a dished slot where the oil pump drive tang engages.  
the slot is probably almost 1 mm wider than the tang, allowing for some slop. 
 Are these 2 compatible?  &gt;&gt;
Hi Dave,
Actually that bit of slop between the sides of the oil pump drive tang and 
the cam slot is to allow for any slight center to center offset of the two 
parts in the engine case.
