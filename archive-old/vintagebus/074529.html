Subject: oil 

Hello All   I just posted this to the type2 list the other day about an 
ongoing test in my 59 panel that has been going on for 4 years. To make it short  
If you have a full flow oil filter then Mobil1 syn. is the best. If you don't 
have a full flow filter then you should use single wt oil  20w20 in winter and 
either 30w30 or 50w50  for hot weather. Just my own test do what you want to.  
Later and have fun  Mark dearing  Salem Import service salem Va
