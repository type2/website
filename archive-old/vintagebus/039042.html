It's definitely not of VW's doing.  There's no way they'd build another rear
engine vehicle and unless its pedal-powered, there's not room in front for
an engine.  The front doors look like they open up to present a whopping 20&quot;
ingress access and the aerodynamics of this bus would make a loaf or a
splitty look like a Miata.

Personally, I think its got some potential.  Start by adding a bit of a nose
to house the engine (hey, its not my choice either, but ya gotta face
facts), increase the front door width, provide some character, and drop the
wind drag and it might work.  Oh yeah, and raise the thing up off the ground
about 10 inches (otherwise what would all the kool cal-look guys have to
spend their money on.  

Looks a hecuvalot better than the last 'new bus' rendition I saw a few years
ago!  At least you wouldn't have to worry about cutting the fenders to house
wider wheels :-)
