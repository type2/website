&gt; the type 4 cooler is the way to go, but you will have to fabricate
&gt; an extended doghouse to do it ( extend the extra  3/4&quot;  to the FIF ).

And speaking of which - I have pix of the mod after it was done at
http://home.ispi_dot_net/~elassley.bie/bustech/t1t4/t1t4.htm if anyone would
like to see them.  My biggest problem with my 1776, 67 bus, freeway flyer
trans, dual 40idf's, and tall 15&quot; tires, and FLAT OUT at 77mph is that once
the outside temps are about 65 or below, my bus never gets over 135 degrees
F.  I'll need to adjust the flaps but it just goes to prove how this oil
cooler does improve cooling.
