I just bought one at the local auto parts chain for a couple of bucks.  It's not called a static timing light of course, it's a 12 volt test lamp/probe.  They stocked it with the bulbs and primary wire and such.  Not as hardcore as making your own, but why kill yourself?

Derrick,

With due respects to the excellent instructions offered by Tom, I 
thought I give you another option to make a timing light.

Many years ago I made a static timing light which has been just about 
indestructible through many entries and exits from my tool box, not 
always with as much care as I should have used.
