I spent Sat. &amp; Sun. finishing up tinting my windows and putting them back
together in the frames. It all took a lot longer than I figured, but I got
'em done. I've installed the pop-outs and cab door windows on one side of
the bus, but still have the other side and the safari's to do. The bus is
really starting to look cool now. I ended up painting my bullet turn
signals white instead of my lower color. I did it 'cause I didn't want to
have to break out the paint just to do those. I never was a fan of that
style, but it looks better than I thought it would. If I break out the
color to paint anything else, I still may do them. For not they're fine
though. After I get some tires and have them mounted on my freshly painted
wheels, I can pull off the old mix-matched ones and then I'll pretty much
be done with the exterior of the bus. Here's some pictures of it right now:

I put some pictures of my re-furbished wood slat roof rack here:

For the vintage nazi's in the group, check out my &quot;home-made&quot; turn switch
knob:

Next comes finishing up the interior. Boy, this part is REALLY fun. 

p.s. Oh yeh, I put a picture of my kids up on the bottom of the main page at:
