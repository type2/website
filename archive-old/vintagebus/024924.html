Hi Gene,
We had the same problem.  Finally fixed it with home door foam tape cut 
thinner by hand to do the job.  We had the 1960 panel camper conversion 
windshiled frames sandblasted without blocking the defrost vents in the dash 
well enough when we first got it.  Took five or six years for the black sand 
to stop coating the dash in only an hour or so of driving with the heater on! 
 Probably best to make a sort of chimney sweep brush up from teh engine end 
of the heater tubing while having a blower push air into the front end of the 
heater.   Eric&amp;Barb
