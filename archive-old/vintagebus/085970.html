Hey Seth    Where did you get this torque valve from??   type 1 oil pump nuts 
 14 ft lbs   type 4 oil pump nuts  22 ft lbs     Now I don't think this is 
your oil leak unless one of the studs stripped out. from over torqueing it.   !3 
mm case nuts 18 ft lbs and large center case nuts 25 ft lbs   later  Mark
