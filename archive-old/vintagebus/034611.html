 Briggs' Vintage License Plate Bill Passes Transportation Committee
 AB 2058 Heading for Senate Appropriations
 
 SACRAMENTO: AB 2058 from Assemblyman Mike Briggs (R-Clovis) is on its way
 to the Senate Appropriations Committee after receiving near unanimous
 support in the Senate Transportation Committee. The measure would allow
 vintage car owners the option of using vintage license plates, if the
 automobile was manufactured before 1974. Current law limits vintage plates
 to automobiles manufactured before 1963. The measure has already
 cleared the State Assembly, and passed its first Senate test
 
 &quot;This is a measure that vintage car owners want and support in the
 effort to make their projects fully authentic,&quot; said Assemblyman Briggs. &quot;I'm
 
 pleased that the Assembly saw the value of this bill, and I'm
 expecting similar support in the Senate.&quot;
 
 The bill would allow vintage car owners to install the highly prized
 black with gold plates that were phased out in 1973. The white reflector 
plates
 currently required by the State of California apply to all automobiles
 
 manufactured after 1963, regardless of vintage status.
 
 The vintage black plates with gold lettering were used on cars from 1963
 to 1969 and on light trucks from 1963 to 1972. A &quot;classic&quot; manufactured
 during this period cannot use the vintage plates under current state law,
 even though they may be the original plates the automobile was outfitted 
with.
 
 The only cars on the road with black and gold plates are those that have
 been continually registered since being purchased new in California more
 than 30-years ago. In fact, many vintage car collectors refer to these
 automobiles as &quot;original black plate cars.&quot;
 
 AB 2058 would require collectors to have a matching set of classic plates,
 which also must be in clean condition.
 
 Although the Senate Appropriations Committee hearing has not been set yet,
 AB 2058 is expected to gain approval. Once passed by the Senate, the
 measure will be placed on the desk of Governor Davis. The Governor has
 until the end of October to either sign the bill into law, or veto it.
