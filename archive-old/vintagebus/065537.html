&gt; Can someone tell me HOW TO GET AHOLD OF SOMEBODY AT NEATO!!  Web site is no
&gt; good. Have missed the last 2 issues (4 months) and want to know whats going
&gt; on. Pay dues a year ahead and still nothing happens. Kind of reminds me of
&gt; SOTO. I would say to NEATO get it together soon. Know Tom is trying but it
&gt; takes more than 1 person. Missed OCTO, what was happening at the NEATO booth?

Well, this is not good.  I just re upped for two years and bought a Spec
Guide.  I did not get the guys name and did not recognize him (bigger
guy with glasses).  I did get a current OBR (its color now) issue?  The
one with Dana's Alaskan DC on the cover.  It has one of Tom's tilts BTW.

That's about all I can tell you from my experience on Sunday.
