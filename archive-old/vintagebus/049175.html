Didn't someone say that VW shipped the hoops broken down and the local dealer welded them together? My set has funky welds, that's for sure. 

My Robert Davis exclusive wood strips had about 6 coats of UV resistant urethane spar stuff on 'em and it broke down and wore off in one year. I'll pull 'em off next spring and redo them with more layers or better stuff. 

 -Harry in Fresno, see you at OCTO
