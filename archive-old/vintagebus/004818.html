.  I'd like to buy a copy.
&gt;
&gt; Also, Woody was parading around the campgrounds with his camera - come on
&gt; Woody - how much for copy.  I gotta have your tape - it's got me on it in
my
&gt; pj's I'm pretty sure!
&gt;
&gt; NQ


        I am presently dubbing a tape of the last 2 BBTA and the last 2
BNNTA.
(I didn't have a video camera for the previous BBTA's).This tape will also
include the last 3 Classics
/ OCTO's crazy weekends(Including the bondage double cab scene,WCM
parties,DKP DQ nights,Charlie H's parties, cruising in the 54
barndoor..etc... etc...),The Der Fatherland Cruise in Illinois and
Michigan,2 VOA shows.Me flipping a bug go-cart and landing on my head ! Many
DBG caravans and camping events !
 I think NQ in his pj's will be on the editing room floor ! You cruising in
your bus in a thong, that's in all the way. And best of all, I'm not in any
of them as I'm taking the pictures !

It will only cost a blank video tape of good quality ,
and here's the hitch, a membership in the DBG.:-)
I have nothing to gain from this except of course the possile company of
some of the fine people on this list !
The more the merrier .I will warn you we do like to drink beer.
