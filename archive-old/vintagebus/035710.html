  oh, I had the impression you had just put this motor (or the top end- from 
the case out)  together recently,  you did mention replacing the heads, 
didn't you?  So I thought you would  have taken the cylinders off and checked 
them for wear,

&gt;  &gt;  &gt; so did you do the measuremnet of the ps/cs like it says in Muir's 
book?
&gt;  &gt;  &gt; put the ring in the cylinder and measure the gap.?
&gt;  &gt;  &gt; 
&gt;  &gt;  &gt; did you CLEAN OUT THE RING GROOVES?  if they have lots of crud in 
there,
&gt;  
&gt;  &gt; it
&gt;  &gt;  &gt; may make it hard to the rings to move freely.
&gt;  &gt;  &gt; 
&gt;  &gt;  &gt; how many miles/hours on this motor? 
&gt;  &gt;  
&gt;  &gt;  Thank you for your reply Clara :)
&gt;  &gt;  
&gt;  &gt;  This is not a short block that was in need of a rebuild. 
&gt;  &gt;  It ran fine for many miles around the island for a period of several
&gt;  &gt;  months with no sign of degrading performance. When I pulled the 
&gt;  &gt;  motor it was because I had one that I rebuilt ready to install.
&gt;  &gt;  If at all possible I want to get the rings unstuck without 
&gt;  &gt;  disturbing the case to cylinder seal push rod tube seal etc. 
&gt;  &gt;  Therefor, I want to do everything possible in with out exposing the
&gt;  &gt;  internals of the engine. I am working on this thing under a mango
&gt;  &gt;  tree...
&gt;  &gt;  
&gt;  &gt;  Aloha
