I don't have a lot of time to post right now so I'll make this quick.  I
went to Rob Laffoon's in Omaha yesterday and made the trip in my bus.  It
was a VERY windy day and the bus was fighting me the whole way.  Part of the
problem I've discovered is a worn out steering box so that's gonna have to
be replaced.  Other than that, I had a blast.  You can see pictures at
http://home.ispi_dot_net/~elassley.bie/67bus/67busupdate3.htm and keep in mind
that I'll post the complete story later.

Enjoy...
