Subject: Re: Subhatch in a 65

Hey Ellis, at least  it was still there and I even got the location correct.
Here's another tidbit: About 20 miles before Sierra Vista is the Tombstone
turnoff. Only way you can turn when traveling south is left, do it. Heres the
hint: right hand turn on dirt road and cross small stream and turn left and
look for real tall trees and real old American iron. There were 3 complete
splits in with the old iron. Would need a chain saw to get them out. They were
for sale cheap but me and Cory said it wasn't worth the trouble at the time,
again quite afew years ago. Think would be worth the trouble nowadays. The guy
had cars lined up along the stream bank to mark his property (another hint).
Was told how to find this guy by the dude I bought the weird plumb ers roof
rack from that is on Kyles/Barbies bus now. Have a great time this weekend in
Tucson and take a little side trip south.
