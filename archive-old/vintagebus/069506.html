Subject: RE: [VB] Wire Connectors

If you're looking for those little tubes that slip over the ends of the
wires for the screw terminal connectors (pre 60 busses), you can buy
them but they're not brass... some other coated metal.  I have a bunch
that I used to do the 59 double cab.  Only problem is I'm currently in
New Orleans for a bit of travel and I can't get you the name of the
company that has them.  If no one else comes up with the name, ping me
on Friday and I'll get the name as I return on Thursday.

BTW, I wore my TS (thesamba) shirt yesterday around New Orleans and
unfortunately, NO ONE came up to me and made a comment.  What is it with
these people in these parts?

Sean asked:

Anyone know of a source for the original style brass wire connectors
found on old VW's?
