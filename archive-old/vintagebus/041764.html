Subject: Friday:  License plates
Message-ID: &lt;Pine.BSF.4.05.10007070822530.45971-100000_at_lenti.type2_dot_com&gt;

Last week, while climbing one of the four passes between Bishop and Carson
City on US395, Marie and I thought up a great license plate for a bus.
Since it's friday, and our bus already has a plate, we'll share it with
you:

ITNKICN or ITHKICN

Only works when going uphill, though!

George
