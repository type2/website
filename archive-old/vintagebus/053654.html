Subject: Re: [VB] Vent windows!

Hi Kevin,
I will be doing the same procedure as soon as my bus is painted.  I am more
concerned about getting the new latches installed in my vent frames, as both of
mine are broken.

BFY has a press like the one that is pictured in the Bentley book.  They will
press in new seals and your windwing glass for $15.  You can send them the
parts, they will install the glass and seals, and send it back to you.  Just a
thought.  Could you let me know if you had problems getting your new vent wing
latches installed?  I have a friend who just went through a Kombi completely,
and he told me that the hardest thing to do of the whole restoration was the
Vent Wings.

Good Luck,
Ed

&gt; Hey,
&gt;
&gt; Workin' on changing door seals on my 63', and made the (mistake?) attempt to
&gt; change the seals that border the vent window to the vent window frame.  Boy
&gt; o boy, lotsa fun!  I had new locks to put in, and cracked the lock in my
&gt; attempt.  I have it rigged enough to the point that if I can get the window
&gt; completly in the frame, it should hold.
&gt;
&gt; The problem is, IF I can get the window COMPLETLY in the frame!  Right now I
&gt; have it about 98% there, but it won't budge.  I have given it a rest for the
&gt; night, thinking maybe after a nights rest, it will be more coperative.
&gt;
&gt; Has anyone any experience with this dilemma?  I have tried using a bit of
&gt; soapy water already, and this did help to get it where it is.
&gt;
&gt; I'll try again tomorrow.....Just venting to an open audience.
&gt;
&gt; Thanks
&gt;
