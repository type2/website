Subject: Installing oil pump troubles
Date: Sun, 21 May 2000 08:58:02 GMT
Mime-Version: 1.0

I got a new oil pump to see if that would help my lack of oil pressure.  
While installing it, getting the gears in and backing plate on seemed awful 
tough.  Just less clearance than the old one so it would make sense to have 
a tighter fit I thought.  My starter hasn't been working for quite some time 
now, so while push-starting it my rear wheels drug and it wouldn't turn over 
at all.  What's the deal?  I need to fix this soon, as this bus is my 
every-day driver and I need it for work.  Thanks and Happy driving--Chet
