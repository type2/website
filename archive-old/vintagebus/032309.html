Wow! Robert...you need to CHILL! Seriously, I agree with everyone that said
it's best that you didn't push it. I've been that casualty (at an OCTO show
...coincidence? heh ) and it's not fun. My only advice though, would have
been to go to the show anyway. I was in the same mood as you when my bus
puked black smoke but I went anyway and had a great time. Being around
other people with the same obsession helped me through my &quot;time of need.&quot;

We're here for you Robert! Get your bus together and bring it down to
Familienfest 7! We'd love to see it on the grass, under the trees...
