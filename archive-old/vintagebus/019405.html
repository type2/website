Scott Fraser mentioned that he now believes in
carrying a spare coulpler...

Ellis agrees and said:

Now I *ALWAYS* carry at least one spare coupler.

The other story that I figure that Kyle, John Howard,
Ronnie or Joe Ginter would tell is about the time that
I blew the coupler two miles away from the Jerome
event. Dropped the retainer bolt, didn't have it
safety wired, didn't have spare bolt or a freeking
flash light.
Eventually got towed into the Jerome event behind a
FORD F150 Supercab like a High school homecoming
float. Hmmm... What a concept. Eventually sold the bus
in exchange for a FORD F150 Supercab. Hmmm... What
another concept. =)
