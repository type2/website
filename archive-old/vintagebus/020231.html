My friend Kyle wrote about doing 90++ in the
Westfailure. Don't doubt it and from personal
experience I can attest that there were minimal
persons wearing seat belts. Yikes!
------------------

I have kept my 36hp Vws at about 80-90kph. 1500-1776's
at 58-70 mph with rare exceptions. 62mph has always
been the sweetspot. The F150 regularly rocks the
freeways in less than typical Phoenix &quot;hair on fire&quot;
style. A/C, CC, CD, seatbelts 100% of the time and
smile on face.
Drive SAFE! Drive SOBER!&lt;--Especially on the Holidays
