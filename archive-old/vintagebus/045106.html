I don't want to sell any busses to anyone who'll take them out of town!  Here 
in Albuquerque, we're still finding the occasional bus, but many that are 
rust free or close to it are being taken back east.  I resent the people who 
are doing that as much as the Japanese, who, as far as I can see, are buying 
what they like, not trying to make a living taking projects that I might find 
in the future.

JP (plenty of projects at the moment)
