Subject: My Side Door Latch
Date: Fri, 14 Aug 1998 00:25:06 PDT

Well, my bus is really begging for me to deal with it. The tranny has a 
slow leak, real slow thank goodness, and so does my master cylinder and 
my steering box. It seems the heat (weather) has kind of opened the 
pores so to speak. I didn't worry about any of this too much, but now 
something new has happened.
My cargo door (side doors) latch now is acting up. The door handle used 
to sort of spring into place. Now when I go to shut the door I must turn 
it to get the striker to move enough to shut. Used to be as smooth as 
can be. When the handle is closed, it hangs, kind of droops down. I 
guess I will take it apart and check it out. Never have looked inside 
there before. Is there a spring? (This is a 63 bus by the way).

Jason
