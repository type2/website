 &lt;&lt; I am having a most grievous time getting the ball of the shifter, with 
its 
 pin that keeps on moving out, back into the cup.  Is there some trick to 
 this?  I am getting mad. &gt;&gt;

 &gt;&gt;
most 66 buses have the later set up with the front of the shift rod setting 
on a pin that points to the back of the bus.   Very early 66s have  the 
previous version, which has a thingy that circles the shift rod a bushing 
going between for imroved shifting, and a bit curved over which has the 
threaded holes that are for attaching the shift stick.

for the later version installation of the rod is simpler, for the earlier a 
friend holding the road and bit  with the threaded bit is very helpful, 
though some people have managed to prop something underneath I have heard. 

 A friend helping orient things (giving directions) from underneath for the 
later version could help, even though they dont need to prop the shift stuff 
up.

so which ever way, the bit under neath is held up, and you have the shift 
plate in oriented correctly, and you point the little spring loaded pin 
doohicky so it points forward, and you have greased the ball and socket joint 
right? and tilt the stick back and wiggle so the pin goes into the the slot 
in the from of the socket.  sometimes the pin wants to slide backwards, and 
this will obscure its proper installation.  Sometimes tapping it before 
installation will get it to stick temporaily so it does not pop backwards, 
but the tilting back thing tend sto work for me.

 Check the spring that you have to press down for reverse it correctly 
oriented around the reverse lockout plate and now you let the cover slide 
down and remember you are still pushing the stick down and get the bolts 
started and just snugged down.  now your kind friend can let go from 
underneath if you have the early version.

so check the shifting and you can move the shift stick base around a bit if 
needed and tighten the bolts.
