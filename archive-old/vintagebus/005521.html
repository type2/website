Subject: Re: [VB] Tap oil stud

&gt; The threads in the case for one of my oil strainer studs is stripped (PO
did
&gt; it) :-).  Is there anyway to tap it for an oversized stud and not get
&gt; shavings in the case without tearing it apart?  I know gravity is on my
side
&gt; but.....

When I build a motor I use bolts threaded from the inside out. You might
strip them, but you're not going to pull them out. 8^)  You can do the same
thing on several of them with the engine together although it is a mother
with the pickup shroud in place. Get the right sized tap for the original
hole and clean up the boogered hole all the way through with it. Get you a
nice long bolt of the appropriate size M-something-or-other, Take your MIG
welder and zap a wire centered directly on the end opposite the head. Feed
out a couple of inches and clip it off. Make the wire straight as you can
for an inch so it spins nice between your fingers. Then bend the wire in a
curve and slide a washer on it. Now put it up in the sump hole and feed the
wire down from the top. Pull it down and straighten it out and bend a hook
on the end for a handle. Now you can thread it down in the hole towards you.
It can either go easy or be a full twelve-pack job, depending on your luck
that day. Get comfy first and enjoy yourself. Once it is as far as you can
get it, double-nut it and bring it down snug. No more worry from that stud.
I replaced the long stud with the nut that holds the sump pickup shroud down
once onna time. Lost a motor to that nut once. PO didn't believe in sump
strainers, but the oil pump did.
