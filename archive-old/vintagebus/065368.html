&gt; Hi George,
&gt; True, but in the case of areas where tapered fit parts the nut could be
&gt; completely gone, and then the taper fit part come completely apart!

I've never seen a nylock nut become even finger loose, let alone loose
enough to fall off on its own!  Large nylock nuts require a fair amount of
force on the wrench to remove them all along their threads.
