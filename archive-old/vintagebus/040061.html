hey,
thanks for reading... i am replacing the long driver rocker on my '66 and 
have run in to some questions. i have 2 repop pieces from RMM and dont 
understand how the &quot;universal side member&quot; fits. i cut out the old rocker 
and the &quot;]&quot; channel that runs front to back welded to the ends of the &quot;I&quot; 
cross beams that run side to side under the floor. (these are in great 
shape)

the replacement piece from RMM isnt shaped like the old &quot;]&quot; channel.

its shaped like this. anyone ever fit one? it would seam that you would have 
to cut it to fit between those two ribs that come down the sides and go 
through the floor behind the rocker.

thanks in advance... sorry if this is complete gobbledygook :)
