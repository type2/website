Subject: camping in Olympics this weekend

been thinking of going camping in the Olympic mountains this weekend.  Snow 
Camping, most likely.

(that's Washington state, folks.)  Thought I'd find out if the Sol Duc hot 
springs campground was open, maybe go to Port Townsend, that kind of thing.   
 If anyone had similar plans and wants to coordinate, give an email
