Subject: RE: [VB] What is this?

It looks like the one made by Kymco, but for a bug. The one for a bus has an
extra diaode coming off one of the relays. If you call them to order SPECIFY
it is for a bus and not a bug or you will not get the extra part needed and
it will not work. I think they are 45 dollars

Is this one of those replacements for the 9 pin turn/flasher relay boxes?
If so who made it and are they still available?  Anybody need one?
