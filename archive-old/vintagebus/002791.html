&gt; 1)Have you ever heard of this item? What's your take? I also have the
&gt; acid etching solution that came w/ POR-15. Is it for the same purpose?
&gt; Can I use the latter instead.
&gt;
I wouldn't use Naval Jelly. It is just a weak acid solution designed to
&quot;dissolve&quot; rust. I think you are referring to POR-15's metal prep. If this
is what you are talking about, this is the thing to use. It reacts with any
rust and converts it to a black primer.

&gt; 2)Should I get 2 different primers, the self-etching primer for exposed
&gt; metal that's worked over by Naval Jelly, and the epoxy primer for the
&gt; non-damaged area? Or etch the exposed metal w/ etching primer and go all
&gt; over again w/ epoxy primer? Or ...??

For the best results, take the entire bus down to bare metal. Use the metal
prep to treat the areas where rust ate into the metal to treat the small
pits where the sander could not reach. Allow to dry 24 hours and then
re-sand the areas treated by the metal prep. If you have deep pits, you may
need to fill these areas. Also, apply filler to any other damaged areas at
this point.

After this is done, prime the entire bus with epoxy primer. After this,
prime again with a sandable primer such as PPG K-36. &quot;Wet-sand&quot; this with
wet-dry 500 grit paper. After this, use glazing putty to fill any
imperfections and re-prime and re-sand these areas with K-36. After all this
is done, you are ready to top-coat.

&gt; 4)For 2-staged paint system, after the primer has been sandblocked, is
&gt; it necessary to use primer surfacer? What about sealer?
&gt;
If you use K-36, it  is a primer surfacer, and if you take it down to bare
metal you don't need to seal unless you want a richer color.  If you did use
a sealer, you would want it tinted to the same color you are using for your
top coat. In your case, you are using 2 colors that won't be enhanced by a
color barrier.

&gt; 5)Should I shoot one panel at a time, or shoot the whole vehicle... I
&gt; received permission to leave it in the shop overnite for the duration,
&gt; and have been lucky so far.. no components missing yet.

Shoot the whole car. Shoot the top first, wait overnight, shoot the bottom.
