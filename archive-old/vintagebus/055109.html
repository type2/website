Subject: Re: [VB] Alternator Rebuild/Replacement

Just leave the shroud be. You would have to pull the engine get that.
Reach around front (front is front) of fan with your 36mm and remove
that big nut. Careful because there are some other parts in there that
will slide off after the nut. Checking out a parts diagram so you know
what little pieces are in there might be a good idea.
Find some way of removing those four machine screws that hold that fan
cover plate on. That is the hardest part. Somebody recently suggested
replacing those with allen head cap screws, I like that idea.
Detach the alternator hold down strap. Ease the alternator out the
back. Cover plate comes with, fan stays in shroud, shroud stays on
engine.
Good luck, try and keep some skin on your knuckles. Don't leave
anything in the fan.

’65 Sundial – all original (except electrical)
I have had several opinions on trying to pull the alternator
(converted)
without removing the engine.  Some say yes – with care – others say
pull the
engine.  Any thoughts – I have read the archives and keep getting
conflicting stories.  If pulling it without removing the engine – how
do you
get the Fan Shroud off?

Thanks

Birch

(also – looking for a good recommendation for a mechanic in the Denver
area
– I may take the engine in for a complete rebuild if I end up pulling
it.)
