Hi all, this just came in from Lee Hedges and I wanted to share it 
with the list.

Hi everyone!
For those of you living in the Southern California &amp; Arizona area ... 
here's the latest!

Each year Bill &amp; Steve's hosts their annual vintage VW get-together.
This year, their End of Summer Picnic is on Sunday October 15th from 
11am-3pm. This event is open to all air-cooled VW owners 
&amp; enthusiasts!

There will be FREE BBQ'd brauts &amp; cold drinks for everyone!!!
There will be an open house at Bill &amp; Steve's so you can buy those 
little (or big) parts your VW has been needing.
There will also be a cool vintage accessories display so you can add 
something unique!
Also, there will be a nice display of vintage VW literature &amp; books 
to check out ...

Questions or need directions?  Email (LeeHedges_at_Type34_dot_org) or call 
(858 578 1189) Lee for more details or an event flyer.
See you there!

LEE HEDGES
