12x1.5x24 that's 12mm with a 1.5 pitch to the threads, 24mm long.  hardness
is supposed to be 10.5, but i have used 8.8's with no troubles.  just hope
your threads aren't stripped.  you may consider running a tap through the
threads, just to clean them up a bit.


&gt; [Original Message]
&gt; I'm in the process of getting my bus ready for a very long trip and I
&gt; noticed that I am missing one of the bolts that bolts the spring plate (I
&gt; think that is what it's called) to the redux box  - whoa - kinda scary
given
&gt; that a couple of others are loose.  Anyway, does anyone know the size of
&gt; these bolts.
