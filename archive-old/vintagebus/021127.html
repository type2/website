Subject: Re: [VB] My DC is too loud???

Hey Scott,

What is too loud?  Do you know the max db level
allowed?  I'd check that out first, or next time ask
the cop if he has a db meter handy.  It can't be as
loud as some of those cheesy riceboy &quot;performance&quot;
resonators.

&gt; I got pulled over today for the DC being too loud by
&gt; the local PD.
&gt; I was heading south of a local street and as I
&gt; turned right, I noticed a
&gt; cop looking at me real close as I went by.  He was
&gt; facing the opposite
&gt; direction and in the left turn lane
&gt; A few side streets later to get around the detour, I
&gt; was back on my
&gt; southbound street.
&gt; I checked my rearview mirror and saw the patrol car
&gt; coming up on me real
&gt; quick w/lights on.
&gt; 
&gt; I knew right away due to his speed and being behind
&gt; me, that I was his
&gt; object.
&gt; 
&gt; I didn't want to be the latest SoCal TV pursuit, so
&gt; I pulled right over.
&gt; 
&gt; He asked for the copy of the registration - says my
&gt; plate returned &quot;not
&gt; on file&quot;.
&gt; I gave him a copy and told him that he needed to run
&gt; it as a ham plate.
&gt; - &quot;oh&quot;
&gt; then he asked for a copy of my insurance.
&gt; then I got, &quot;your engine is too loud&quot;
&gt; I asked for permission to get out and show him what
&gt; I'd done, explained
&gt; everything, etc. (Type IV motor, dual exhausts, etc)
&gt; 
&gt; &quot;Nope, too loud&quot;
&gt; I said, &quot;that's strange, I volunteer for xxPD (next
&gt; door city), and in
&gt; all that
&gt; time, no one's ever said anything about it&quot;
&gt; he looked at me hard, &quot;you volunteer for the PD?&quot;
&gt; me: &quot;yes....&quot;
&gt; him: &quot;hmmm...&quot;   thinking thinking thinking
&gt; he mumbled something like &quot;i'm not surprised they
&gt; didn't say anything&quot;
&gt; (who knows what he meant by that)
&gt; 
&gt; Then I got a lecture about being lucky that the
&gt; truck is older than 65
&gt; and smog equipment not required, how people between
&gt; 65 and 74 think they
&gt; 
&gt; can strip off all the smog equipment, I need to take
&gt; it to a muffler
&gt; shop to quiet it down.
&gt; finished with, &quot;I'm not going to cite you, but get
&gt; it fixed.&quot;
&gt; 
&gt; I have actually had a cop pull along side of me (not
&gt; this city) and
&gt; comment on
&gt; the truck and ask what year it was and if I wanted
&gt; to sell it. nod,
&gt; smile and drive off.
&gt; 
&gt; I guess I'll be paying a visit to a muffler shop
&gt; soon,
&gt; 
&gt; Scott
&gt; '60 DC 2L type IV &amp; two too loud mufflers.
