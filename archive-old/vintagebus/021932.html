&lt;&lt;Hey, anybody know how make some sort of contraption so you can rip the
suspension out or your bus and still be able to move it around? I've got a
pair of big castors , but I can't figure out what the best way to mount them
to the bus would be. Any ideas? I'd prefer it to be as simple as possible
too.

Hi Jason,
The Vw shop tool was made from thick angle iron and bolted to the tranny forks
with one caster bolted in the down position.    Eric &amp; Barb
