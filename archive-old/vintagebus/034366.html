Subject:  Single/double cab bed patch panels
Date: Wed, 16 Feb 2000 09:02:59 +1030

The recent mail about cargo bed replacement
has motivated me to write about something I have
been thinking about for a while.  And what have
I been thinking about?

I have been thinking about making
single/double cab cargo bed patch
panels .... (note I'm talking about a
1200 x 750 mm patch panel rather
than a 'complete' bed replacement).

I could make them  and the profile would
be good.  BUT I'd also need to sell some
into the US -  while a few (literally) people
want them here in Oz I'd never sell enough locally
to recoup my setup/development costs ........

Ergo I've been thinking about trying to find
a reputable US parts house to talk about them buying 50
sheets or so.

Price is a potential problem.  My selling 
price would be around US$30 a sheet. These would be 
hand made and require some
20 pressings/alignments per sheet as opposed to one stamping.
(i.e, a fair bit of time per sheet).  I'd estimate another $6 US
per piece landed to US parts house (on 50 sheets).

Parts house would probably add 80% to 100% margin
meaning buying price would be around $60 to $70
per sheet in the US.

Would you single/double cab owners pay this
sort of money for cargo bed patch panels?
