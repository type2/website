Subject: Nearly OT, it's Friday

Bus owners are probably closer to the every day truth out on the road than any 
other organized car club.

Michael Moore of &quot;Roger and Me&quot; fame has a new documentary out called &quot;Bowling 
for Columbine&quot; that refers to the fact that the two kids that tragically shot 
up their high school calmly attended their first period phys ed class of 
bowling before the rampage.

This movie is not a simple story or  a simple solution. It has received rave 
reviews and is now being shown in the hinterlands and I urge you to see it 
while you can.

Moore is a life long NRA member and realizes that gun ownership isn't causing 
all the gun related deaths in this country. He explores issues beyond the gun 
control issue that Americans need to discuss. 

VW people cut across the spectrum, so I encourage you to consider this topic 
that too many special interests are not bringing up for debate. This isn't 
about gun rights, it's about progress as a culture.
