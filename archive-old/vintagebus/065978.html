Subject: RE: [VB] Monster Garage comes to Havasu

[...]

For tales of a VW-based homebuilt &quot;schwimmerwagen&quot;, go to:

http://www.inertia_dot_org/acvwjyro/acvwjy/index.htm

and scroll down to the &quot;Schwendlemeyer Schwimmerwagen&quot; paragraph.  I suggest starting with the &quot;Cuyahoga River&quot; episode.

=================================

&gt;&gt;
I will be leaving in a few minutes to go watch the Discovery channel
film an episode of Monster Garage here in Lake Havasu. They have converted a bus to float and drive like a boat (a school bus not one of beloved VW
buses).  I am going to try and get one of my buses in some backround shots, we'll see what happens.
