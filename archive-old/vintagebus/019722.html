Sort of.  From May 59- approx 62, the nosecones had 8mm stud holes for the front mount.  After that they had 10mm stud holes.  Somewhere around 65 they started putting a brass seal holder and rubber seal on the front of the nosecone for the hockey stick. The seal holders are not available anymore (and not the same as bug ones), so if you have one, make sure to keep it in good shape.  The seals are replaceable and the same as bug.  Late 67 nosecones had a hole for the reverse light switch.  You can use any tunnel type nosecone from a bus on a tunnel type tranny, just make sure to get the right mount for the nosecone, and if it has a seal be SURE to replace it before putting your tranny back in.
