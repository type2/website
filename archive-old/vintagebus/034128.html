I stock both the Dansk and the Lietritz bus mufflers, Dansk made in Denmark
and the latter made in Germany, as for resonator and tail pipe tip, those I
have only in Dansk and 2 different style of tips the correct weird bent
early tip and the latter bay tip. All of my hardware kits are of German
origin and have the correct donut and clamps for the resonator. The tailpipe
bracket I also have 2 different in stock, 1 is a galvanized bracket (no
rust?) and the other is made by Dansk, painted the same as the rest of there
exhaust products.
These mufflers are for the 1500-1600 and bigger engines for the 40 hp
engines I just received some NOS (here we go again) genuine VW bus mufflers,
these are the ones with the VW logo in the center of the muffler, Also (if
it works out) I will have some NOS VW logoed 1500 original mufflers in the
near future. For those of you with a tight budget I also have OEM Mexican
bus mufflers, these are the ones used on all the 1600 loafs in Mexico, which
will work on all 1500/1600 split buses, and fit a lot better then the
Brazilian.

Most of these items are on my new online catalog with the same descriptions
and we are adding more items daily to help fulfill your needs. If you don't
see or can't find what your looking for, call or p-mail and I can add it to
the catalog and/or tell you if the item in stock.Less then 10 per-cent of my
current inventory is entered.

I bought a stock replacement muffler for my rebuild 1600DP (used to have 
an extractor exaust) about half a  year ago. It is made by Kradon, 
Brazil P/N 211 251 051EB.
Now that I finally get around to finishing this motor I find that the ends
that 
are supposed to slide on to the heaterboxes are *barely* long enough to
meet the 
pipe coming out of the heaterboxes, barely. They are about 1 inch long and
it seems that
they are should to be longer then that?  Am I missing something?
Wrong muffler? Is the brazilan no good and should I buy german?
