&gt;Al and the list ,,
&gt;I'm not trying to be an a$$ but this is my outlook on a thief , get a *amn
&gt;job and work for what you need or want as i have done for nearly 30  years
&gt;now. I have worked my tail off to get what i have and i have no tolerence
&gt;for some low life thief thats too *amn sorry to work, and come in and helps
&gt;himself to what i have scrimped and saved to get. This might not be the 
&gt;rite
&gt;way to look at it, and i'm sorry if it offends anyone, but thats the way i
&gt;am. I'll bend over backward to help some one, but don't just help yerself
