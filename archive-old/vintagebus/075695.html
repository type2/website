Subject: Re: [VB] clocks and such (fwd)

Boyd,

If you have a broken 6Volt clock and want it rebuilt to 12V spec (they
replace the movement in either clock with a 12V quartz movement), call
North Hollywood Speedometer in NH, CA. They are online at:

&gt; Hello List,

&gt; clocks to 12 volt specs. Any leads would be greatly appreciated.  Also where
