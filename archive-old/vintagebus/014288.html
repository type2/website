Hey NQ - any time you feel really down, check out my '54.  Nothing
cheers someone up quicker than to see someone else worse-off.

Kinda like the kick you get when watching COPS - no matter how bad your day 
was, no matter how bad you think you have it, the poor guy on your TV screen 
is having a worse day than you are.

Thom
