taking apart the tranny from my 61 I find some interesting things.

apart from the thrashed upper outer bearing in the left reduction gear box,  
which lost half its ball bearings, and the circlip fell off the end of the 
axle and the space for the circlip was gone and the marks on the eft axle,    
tells me good thing that got taken apart.  (shavings in the oil was the clue, 
had no loud RG noises)

It turns out the tranny has a 35:8 rig and pinion. Yes sirs and ma'ams that 
is 35 teeth on the ring gear, a 4.37 r&amp;p.   this is how it tached out, also 
are the readings from the tranny Todd Hill buildt for my 65 westy, with a 
3.88 r&amp;p, and a .82 4th.   Both done on the same tach.

                                61                      65

1st gear 3K          12mph          9mph

2nd gear    2K     16mph        13mph
       3K                        23mph       20mph

3rd gr 2K               27 mph         23
           3K                   38                    37

4th gr 2K                40                      38
            3K                   58                      58


so I retract my previous statememt about how they tached out the same, casue 
I ws only thinking of certain gears, evidently.


soon to find out what else was in there
