Please post any tips and tricks for this to the list!  I'll have to do this
eventually and I like to learn any information people could provide.
Thanks!!

&gt; Has anyone here done a full wiring replacement and are willing to send
&gt; me some tips &amp; tricks?
&gt;
&gt; I know that the fuel sender is a little longer, and I'm ready to splice
&gt; that in. Bob at WW says my alternator isn't a problem either. A good
&gt; fish-tape is hanging in my garage, Bently at hand, I've got a good
&gt; crawler and a dry driveway. What's next?
