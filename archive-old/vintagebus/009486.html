Subject: New Tilt maker/ SS upholstery

Spoke to Jill ( as mentioned a few days ago) she didn't know how much the
standard price would be yet. She also stated the name of her new business is
'SS upholstery' (shes gonna be doing it full time) so hopefully it wont be a
6month wait on the canvas like other makers. Will post the info on my site
when shes ready.
One question, has anyone ever seen green stitching on an og tilt? Ive seen
blue , but green? she said she has an og one with green. I think Ive also
seen red. Can Anyone with an og tilt tell me what they got?
