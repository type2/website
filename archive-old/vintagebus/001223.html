I wonder if the thickness varies depending on the type of soil your setting
the concrete on? I know they recommend 48 inches for the wall footings
because this puts the bottom of the wall below the frost line here in Omaha
NE. I  hear there are different recommendations for different areas.  I
think they did recommend 4 inches with out the fiber glass, but they said 3
inches would be the least thickness with the fiberglass and still have
vehicles drive on it. I never asked about driving dump trucks on the
concrete though.

Thanks,

Kevin Sullivan
