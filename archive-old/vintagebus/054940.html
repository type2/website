Hi AL,
It is a 1.5mm thread pitch.  Best while you are there to drill and tap the 
holes deeper and install 30mm or longer bolts instead.  We have had at least 
one bolt strip on each tranny installation till we did this as standard 
practice.  This allows each bolt to have one or more inches of threads to 
hold instead of the stock 3/4&quot; length in the RGBs threaded holes!
