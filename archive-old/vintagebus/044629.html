Subject: Re:  [VB] where do I plug it?
To: jelm2_at_yahoo_dot_com, vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com



My bus (67 deluxe sunroof DARTHVW etc. etc.) has no
place for a cigarette lighter.

The dash has (from left to right) wiper knob, steering
pod, headlight knob, emergency light knob.
There's an ashtray sittin' up by the windshield, but
no cigarette lighter in the dash.

The reason I ask is: 
I figure I should buy one, since there's about 12 in
every single booth at every show I go to. Are they
repro-ing these things like Nikes in a Malaysian
sweatshop or what?

Well, there are many choices here.   My choice was to plug it in the radio 
block off.   because I had a radio block off with a hole already drilled in 
it.    I had bought on of those that look kinda stock, although the knob was 
the wrng colour for my 65, so I put a grey knob on it and it matched but it 
died rather quickly and I ended up getting another from AL's or whatever that 
has a light, and glows green on the ash, real helpful for use at night.   I 
don't know what else to say, I personally wouldn't drill any holes in the 
dash, have seen plugs with a bracket on them for under tray attachment.
