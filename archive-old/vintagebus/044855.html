I think the dynamo died last week, sypmtoms were there, bus ran fine but

then lights started to dim/get bright with revs, and then once home there

was zilch when it was stopped and restarted.

 -- - - -- -
did the genertor light on the dash glow?  If so was it brighter at low revs 
or at high revs?

if it was brighter at high revs, check the generator brushes- they are cheap 
and well the lower one can be a bit tricky but replace both.  If the little 
brushes (greyish dark carbon things that dont look like what I think of as 
brushes) are at or below the metal rectangle holder there are worn down- get 
new ones.

it it is brighter at high revs it is probably your voltage regulator- that 
box on the side that the two wires from the gen go to.    I have also had a 
bad regulator make something short in the generator, but that is obvious 
because of the electrical smelling burnt smell.
..............

So, I renewed some dodgy looking spade connectors between the dynamo and the

regulator(is that what it's called?) on the firewall, and I was going to

check the output of this (should be around a 12V DC out right?) to confirm

where the problem was lying - what is the input to this regulator? 12V AC?

 -- - - - is you check the voltage with the bus running with the D+ on the 
gen and ground the ground to ground, it should be 14V at revs, 12 at idle
....................

Anyhow, had my SO in the cab on starting duty with newly charged battery,

and she turned on the electrics, got red light, got solenoid click, but then

as soon as she tried to start it, there was another click up front and

nothing. All fuses are present and correct, 12V into the fusebox OK, but

nothing is getting power. Is there anything back there likely to burn  out?

It all looks OK...
 -- - - - - 
first I would clean the battery cables, both at the battery terminal (clean 
them too) and the ground strap to thebody of the bus.  is the ground strap 
decent?   leav e it off the battery, and go under the bus, disconnect the 
connection on there (13mm nut) clean them bright, and reconnect.  make sure 
the push on thick red wire is secure, you may want to remove it, shine up its 
connector, and reconnect.   That wires leads from the ig switch to activate 
the starter.  if it falls off for some reason the key wont start the bus.  

This helps the current flow.  even if you have 12V getting around the wires, 
corrosion at the connections can lose enough power (amps or ergs or whatever 
something, i dunno the name, dont need to) so that the starter doesn't work.  
  It is not a bad idea, especially if you live in a damp climate, to clean 
all your electric connections.  boring yes,  but you can start at the back, 
like with the taillights, and watch you lights get brighter.    I pulled the 
fuse box out of my 65 the otehr day, cleaned up all the bits, and it works 
better now.  doing that be careful to make a map of how to plug the wires 
back in BEFORE you pull them all off.  and disconnect the battery first as 
there are hot wires there, dont lose that clip that holds the fuse block in 
place.
