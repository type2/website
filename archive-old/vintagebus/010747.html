I am going, however I was wondering whent he swap meet is, I was thinking it
was Sunday and was trying to get there that day.  I am also looking at
buying a 1957 Kombi in Longview on Friday, that I might or might not haul
down there.  It would probably be a daily driver or parts.

In case it was missed, does anyone know anything about the &quot;Bug-In&quot; at
Portland International Raceway?
