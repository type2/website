Subject: link pin won't fit

I ordered new spindles from Bus Boys last year. I'm just getting to installing
them today. For the extra bucks I had them press in new link pin bushings.
Now for the problem (there's always a problem!), The driver's side installed
fine. Now that I'm on the passenger's side, the top pin will not fit through
the bushing. The bearing cage fits in fine on it's own, but once I slide the
cage onto the pin and try to install it, the needle bearings are forced
outwards and cause the assembly to be too large in diameter to fit into the
bushing. Same happens if I install the cage first them try to slip in the
pin.

So...did bus boys neglect to ream this bushing? The manual says nothing about
reaming the link pin bushings after pressing them in (unlike the king pin
bushings).

Do these bushings require reaming? If so, I'll tackle that chore with my brake
cylinder hone as with the swing lever center pin. Other wise, what could the
problem be? An out of spec link pin? They are the originals from the bus.

Appreciate your thoughts,
