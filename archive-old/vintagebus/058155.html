Subject: RE: [VB] Berg Shifter?

I received lots of very positive feedback about this Berg bus shifter!  So I
thought I would post a few excerpts, since not many people responded
directly to the list:

&gt;Slid into all the gears really sweet.&lt;

&gt;wouldn't leave home with-out it.&lt;

&gt;It is better than advertised. It has quality all over it.&lt;

&gt;This thing is just so sweet, I don't think you will ever regret.&lt; 

&gt;I can shift gears as smoothly as cutting through butter and I can do it
with my back on the seatback&lt;

&gt;I would never drive another bus without one.&lt;


The main &quot;issues&quot; people relayed on to me were about the initial
installation and that all the shifter bushings need to be in good shape.
Basically it takes a little patience to get it lined up perfectly like any
shifter change, even stock.


Thanks for the great feedback!
