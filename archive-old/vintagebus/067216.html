&gt; Is it possible to convert to the late tank and still use a BN4?

Hi Sean,
Brrrr it is cold here at 28F!!  Just got back inside from measuring the 
1968-71 gas tank in our 1960 panel camper conversion and the stock tank in 
our 1962 SO-34 Westie.  The measurement from the left side of both gas tanks 
to the inner wheel well wall is exactly the same at 2-7/8&quot;.  So having a gas 
heater passage through to the interior should work just fine!!
