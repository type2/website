&gt; Yup, from what I've seen here in Sacramento, their marketing campaign is

Well, I went down and drove one and, uhh, bought it.  The wife's bug is
long overdue for restoration and this was the closest new vehicle to the
bug in functionality.  It's shorter than an Echo, but the interior room is
huge.  Four six-footers in top hats can sit in it comfortably.  Despite
its boxy shape and moderate height it handles like a go-kart.

We're calling it The Nanobus.
