Diesel,
   Very daunting....and alot off time! After I hit it with a scraper to get 
all the big stuff off I moved to a wire brush to get the stubborn gunk out 
of there. After that I could even see the real shape of the trans mount 
horns(they exist?...yes they do), then I moved to a rag drenched with laquer 
thinner and scrubbed, scrubbed,etc.. The whole process took a few day of 
about 4 hours but a little progress goes a long way. I tried to use a 
pressure washer to remove some off the junk, but unless you have acess to 
something over 2500psi I've found you kinda waste your time. The rear 
section of the undercarrige is much more intricate than the rest of the 
floor pan and I am anticipating less time for the mid and front sections. 
After it was all cleaned up I hit it with some 3M sponge brushes (for 
removing rust and paint, any Ace hardware_at_ $10 each single and double 
thickness) and blew it clean with air and a final cleaning wipe down with 
acetone.
   When I went to paint it, I bought a wonderful product from The eastwood 
company (http://www.eastwoodcompany_dot_com) called corroless rust stabilizer. 
It bruses on and has a nice red-brown color (I like the color so much I am 
gonna leave it as is). It is also epoxy harded and heat resistant to 500F. 
I'll send some pictures to the list today or tommorrow so you can check out 
how its coming along!!!

-Christian

PS- this was no small job, I have everything out of the rear of the bus so 
it made it a little easier!
