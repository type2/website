&lt;&lt; Authenticity costs money - how authentic do you want to be?  There are four
 safari reproers that I know of; bus boys, wolfgang, izzies and creative
 engineering.  Bus boys and wolfgang are just about identical, but are
 nowhere near the originals, and use modified ventwing latches.  Izzy's look
 closer to stock, and are a good compromise.  CE's safaris are supposed to
 be the bomb, but they're also close to the price of the originals,
 especially once you get them shipped over from England, where they're made.

My Creative safaris cost me a total of $475 US to get here....I've heard of 
originals going for up in the $600 dollar range...
