Subject: Do I need therapy?
Mime-Version: 1.0

OK. So you may or may not remember, 1 1/2 weeks ago I had the lugnuts on my 
front driver's tire back out and the wheel came off when I was driving my 
'59 Kombi. Luckily I was going about 20MPH and no one was hurt...except my 
bus. The dogleg got all bent up and the drum  was bent a tad out of round.

Well, I got my drum turned from an old guy here in town who is &quot;the 
master&quot;...for $7.50. Great job too. I cleaned and greased all the bearings 
and put it all back together. I ended up pulling the drum on the other side 
and doing the same thing over there. I adjusted the front brakes and 
tightened up the emergency brake. So everything SHOULD be fine.

But now I find myself nervous and uncomfertable driving. I keep waiting for 
something to happen again. Having a wheel come off was pretty intense...and 
I can't seem to shake it.

Is this gonna go away? I feel good about my work, but I'm just nervous for 
some reason. Anybody else ever have this?

I had planned on driving from San Angelo to Ennis for the bug-in on may 
6th. I think it's about a 500 mile round trip drive. I'm gonna do it 
regardless...I just hope I can &quot;get it together&quot; so I can enjoy the drive.
