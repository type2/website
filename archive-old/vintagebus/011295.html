 &lt;&lt; The situation: My &quot;Certificate of Title&quot; states the VIN to my '63 as being
  7024040.  The VIN on my bus is accually something far different (988295).
  
  The big question: Does 702040 sound like an engine number?  &gt;&gt;
 Hi Derrick,
 Sure does!  According to &quot;Progressive Refinements&quot; chassi No. 970 990 had 
 engine No. 6 916 251 built on 30JULY62.  Chassi No. 988 771 had engine No. 7 
 020 161 built on 29AUG62.  So yours is a very early 63!  What would be great 
 for you to get is the &quot;Birth Certificate&quot; from VW that would show the 
engine, 
 chassi numbers, and Mcodes.  Several states used to use only the engine 
 number for IDing a vehical.   Eric&amp;Barb
 
  &gt;&gt;
yes- my 53 was registered to the engine number rather than the chassis number 
when I got it- which I got changed, though this was not difficult as it had 
that number on the engine.    WA state did this until 58 or so.  Oregon also 
did this- there was a 59 that was registered to the original number in oregon 
which original motor was long gone, that was just curiousity, but another bus 
had the same deal, and the guy who bought it to reg in another state got the 
paperwork from the factory and got it sorted with reging to the chassis 
number.
