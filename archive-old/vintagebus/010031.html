Awesome idea man!  Count me in.  If the bus can swing by I-80 or I-70, I'd
be willing to drive it a distance for you.  Hell, how can a guy turn down an
offer for free fuel and eats?  I think this would be an excellent idea.  Put
me on your list man!  I can also take pictures of the trip.

 (Southeast corner of Nebraska - about 2.5 hours north of I-70 and 40
minutes south of I-80.)

  I could either pick it up someplace and drive it to Omaha, NE or take it
from Lincoln/Omaha and drive on out to Des Moines or even Illinois with it.
Keep me posted - sounds like a run that would be equivalent to the great
hubcap passing except this time you get to &quot;drive&quot; the torch.  Even the
drivers could toss in a little momento in a box that would kind of signify
their leg of the trip.

Later...
