&gt;  _at__at__at__at__at__at__at__at__at__at__at__at__at__at_ Hi Thanks.....It's gone! And the
&gt;  welding done to cap off  that &quot;Heat Log?&quot; Looks
&gt;  pro...and it looks German to me!(original)The welding
&gt;  around the tube on the right side where it comes up
&gt;  thru the floor and then goes back under the bus looks
&gt;  like the left side tube that you say goes into the
&gt;  cargo area to a heat log under the rear seat...well no
&gt;  log and no venting...just a couple of flat pieces of
&gt;  metal with a very nice fit and weld are where that
&gt;  exit vent? ..log? should be....so it must be factory??
&gt;  Why would someone remove something like that and fit
&gt;  and weld in such a nice cap? and the welds match the
&gt;  other side....big fat even welds(thats welding
&gt;  lingo..haha)And what effect does that have on cooling
&gt;  the engine?Well anyways thanks for the info.The more I
&gt;  dig the more I find!

huh, you just have a tube poking out of  the floor that is capped off in the 
cargo area?  that is definately odd.
