about the coffee mug holder. i bought one of those deals from walmart that
sits on the seat. it's cushioned grey vinyl (matches the seat even :-) and
has 2 cupholders in front, a junk tray behind it and then a big
compartment with a lid that can hold a six pack of soda and other stuff
too. makes a great armrest as well. i couldn't live without it. doesn't
leave much room for anyone else on the front bench seat of my '60 westy,
but i'm usually alone during my daily commute anyway. oh, it was on the
expensive side, like $30.
