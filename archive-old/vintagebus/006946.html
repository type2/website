Just recieved a shippment of alt/gen pulleys that are made in the good ol U
S of A, will test on my bus this weekend (750 mile round trip) and see how
they work and hold up. These look very good and have a much better stamping
then the OG ones I have and the Brazil, Taiwan or Mexican ones I also have.
