&gt;    I used to be in favor of parking cars in the yard and having a 
&gt;&quot;collection&quot;.
&gt;Now I'm a few years older and I have a house. Which in turn makes me 
&gt;interested
&gt;in property value. show you that a smaller town isn't necessarily the 
&gt;answer.

Hey everyone,

My name is Boyd Smith.  I live in Elizabethton, TN and have been following 
this thread for several days now.  Some interesting points have been made in 
that people tend to cluster with like people. This is human nature.  The 
problem is that most Bus restorers are not like people.  The wide appeal of 
the VW is one of the keys to it's popularity.   I purchased 20 acres of land 
in a place where I could afford 20 acres of land.  I could have have 
purchased a nice lot in suburbia for the same price.  The three busses 
sitting in my yard are my pride and joy.  They are close enough to the house 
I built that I can hug them on the way to work.  One runs very well, one 
barely runs, and the other hasn't a prayer of running in the next 10 years.  
The point is they are mine, I love them and will do whatever it takes to 
protect their right to be near me.  Busses are beautiful, running or not. In 
closing, my 86 year old mother can't run any more but I'll be damned if 
anyone is going to make me get rid of her.
