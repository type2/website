NOT MY BUS, nor have I seen it.  Please contact seller....

I ran across some old classified advertisements for some out of way busses
and got a couple of hits.  In this case, the seller took 4 days to answer
e-mail.  I also suspect there haven't been many people to inquire about
it....

Sounds like a good deal to me.  If &quot;no rust&quot; really means &quot;no rust&quot;.

Here is the original advertisement:
==== original ad ===
1966 VOLKSWAGEN VAN, Original Grateful Dead Exterior Art Work. No rust.
Garaged 8 years.Blue.Unknown mileage., $2,000.00, (503) 743-2585
cairo_at_imagina_dot_com
Location: Turner, , OR
==== end original ad ====

I wrote and got this response at 3:00pm Sunday (today):

=== Sunday info ====

Van still available.  Body style is 11 windows .  Four each side. Two in
front (split window)  one in rear.

The body style is a standard bus with the tilt out side windows. Has both
front and rear bumpers.  Interior had been camperized.  I removed part of
the camperized interior. I  installed  original style side windows.  So the
exterior is now original with the original Grateful Dead paintings on the
front drivers side and rear.

=== End sunday info =====

The price sounds right, I'm holding out for the Double Cab.
