THis is my lo tech way to clean gas tanks-

Part 1

drain, remove tank.  remove little tube screen and outlet.

pour some gravel in the tank and shake it.  Funky music helps.  Pour out 
gravel and rust particles.

repeat the gravel a couple times

insert new screen and your cleaned outlet

put tank in bus.

Part 2

get piece of speaker magnet that will fit down the fill spout. sew into small 
bag and sew to a loop you bent in the end of a wire coat hanger.

Insert magnet down fill pipe.  bent hook in end of coat hanger so you can 
move it over the edge of the filler and remove it later.  At this point I use 
an aftermarket gas cap instead of my nice original alumium VW one.

Fill tank and drive bus around.  Each time you put gas in, remove magnet and 
hang from roof rack.   The gas will dry off.  Then knock the rust bits off 
and put it back in the tank before driving.   When the magnet no longer picks 
up rust bits, leave it in the garage for the next crusty VW you feel sorry 
for.

Part 1 can be omitted, but sometimes you'll have to blow the fuel line open 
with a air hose.

I had a magnet in my 65 westy's tank for 3 months after I started driving it. 
 The bus had sat for years before I got it, and the rust kept fouling the 
filters (I had added one before the fuel pump) and in spit of that I had to 
clean the carb out twice. Also a couple times remove the fuel hose from pump 
and blow the crud blocking it back into tank, at inopportune times and 
places.   My brother suggested a magnet in the tank.  It immediately halted 
the hesitation problem.

I pulled the tank a year or so later to fit a new gas guage sender, and it 
was nice inside.  :)  Even the tube screen was fine.
