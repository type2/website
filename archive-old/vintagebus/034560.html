 Hey all,
         Can anyone confirm the interchangability between the cooling fan of
 a doghouse shroud vs a standard upright?  I have a pile of standard shrouds
 and just found a doghouse shroud but it is missing the fan.  Someone told
 me that the old uprght fans were wider.
 
 T &gt;&gt;
if you use a doghouse fanshroud you need the wider fan and the cooler and the
vent pieces and all that stuff.   you can put either set up on an upright
motor, but it may require a stuf with different threads at each end in the
case where the cooler bolts on. There are doghouse bases with different size
studs sticking down for whetehr your case has bigger or smaller holes there.
