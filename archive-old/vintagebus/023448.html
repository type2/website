The guy at http://www.thuntek_dot_net/~cknight/VW/ is typical, they do ask you
to take it down before they sue you :)

Anyway, I looked around and saw a lot of domains registered like &quot;myvw_dot_com&quot;
and &quot;vwparts_dot_com&quot;.  The &quot;VWParts_dot_com&quot; site (not mine) is typical of how VW
should do this... make sure there is a clear disclaimer (which I have done
on my site since it was up).  In fact, on the VWParts_dot_com page you will see
this disclaimer at the upper right of all pages (at least the few I
checked).

I guess we will find out if the disclaimer is good enough ;)

&gt;Stephen,
&gt;Are you going to be sued by VW?

yeah they'll prolly add him to the list. VW of America aren't the nicest
gents known.
check out this page which used to be the biggest link page of VW sites I
have ever seen. over 100 links at least. but he can no longer run it. Why?
cause VW of America has some mental probs and dont care about their devoted
followers who keep them in business. check out the link and bring your
doggie bags cause im sure this will make you sick.

Has a copy of the f*^&amp;$ed up letter on his page.
gimme a break VW.
