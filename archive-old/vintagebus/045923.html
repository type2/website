Subject: My Bus is finally home!
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

Hello folks, I finally trailered my 62 Kombi home on Friday. It's gonna need 
quite a bit of work but it's all original and I'm the 3rd owner. I managed to 
track down rear seats for it so it's almost complete. Is a middle seat with 
the outer third that folds down and is full width correct for a 62? According 
to the M Codes my Bus had rear seats and masonite paneling, but all that's 
gone. I recall someone mentioning where to get stuff that was very close to 
original, where might that be? Anyone know what the code 372 is, it's not 
really explained on the list at Type2_dot_com? I think the code may have 
something to do with an extra switch on the dash. to the right of the 
headlight switch there is another switch that looks factory. After switching 
it on I heard a dull buzzing sound from under the dash, I went out and looked 
and saw both front directionals were on but not flashing (signals dont work). 
I guess this is some kind of emergency flasher system? I didnt think a 62 
would have something like that. Does anyone else have a setup like this? I'll 
stop my babbling now and hope someone can answer these questions for me, I 
like to find out as much about this Bus as I can. Thanks everyone!
