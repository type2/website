IMHO, that's was way too cheap.I would say $300 to $500
is what they go for in this neck of the woods.(midwest)
Good Luck,

&gt; I think i sold a tent like this to Dave barnes for about 100$.
&gt; Probably too cheap.....?

&gt; &lt;&lt;Hey list,
&gt;
&gt; Yes it does have a floor.  I put a pic of a similar tent with the square
&gt; opening up at  vw planet in the camper section.  I am going to put a
picture
&gt; of the tent I am selling up right now on the planet.  Do a search for
&gt; westfalia tent.  The joe clark page says this is a 72-74 tent.
