 I have yet to recieve it but research
&gt; reveals that I will need some sort of attachments for
&gt; the tent.  Would these be w/the tentpoles or should my
&gt; bus have these.  &gt;

Pat;
I have an original '66 SO-42 walk-through which came with the B-42 M-Code
 &quot;Standard SO-42 Interior with pop-up top, side tent and roof rack.&quot; The
only
attachment for the side tent to the bus is the aluminum channel which runs
along the drip rail above the cargo doors and back to where the roof rack
clamps to the drip rail. My tent is yellow with a blue top and multi-colored
striped entry flap.
It has blue cloth sewn around the walls at the bottom and the window flaps
are blue to match the top. It has no floor, and around the base of the tent
are clear plastic loops for stakes.
There is a cloth flap (yellow) which has a rubberized  lip sewn into it that
is pulled through the channel. On the other end of this flap is a series of
metal button snaps that snap to the tent.
If your tent was sold to you as &quot;complete&quot; it should have this flap to
attach it to the bus.
Somewhere on the net is a set of instructions for assembling the tent and
attaching it to the bus.
I think I have this page printed somewhere, if you have a fax I would be
glad to fax it to you.
Look a Thom's site, www.vintagebus_dot_com, I think it might be there somewhere.
Maybe someone else reading this knows where this instruction page is
located.
I'm no absolute authority on this, but I do know that I have an original
SO-42 that nobody has altered or changed, and that's how mine is set up. I
hope this helps.
