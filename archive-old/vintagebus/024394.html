Subject: A warning on the el cheapo Weber 32/36 DFEV kits...

I just thought I would share this since many of you might own a Weber
progressive setup...
	I ordered a Weber progressive carb kit, including a new Weber 32/36
DFEV carb, manifold center section, heat riser tube-lets, and a chrome
air cleaner... along with a bunch of other necessities, from one of &quot;the
companies&quot;. The Weber is slated to be installed on a 1776 engine with
6.6:1 CR, 009, stock DP heads &amp; stock cam, on a daily-driver '70 Westy. 
	It arrived and I began to check out things... The manifold is decent,
if just a little long... so I shortened it, accidentally cutting off an
inch more than I needed to. No problem... I'll weld an inch back on
since I kept the cut-off end piece. It's nice though... they say that
they leave it long that way to allow wider (stroked or shimmed, I
suppose) motors to fit it ok.
	Fine... except that things are installed in a dubious way. The aluminum
carb riser piece is JB-welded to the longer steel tubes. I don't mind
this, because I think that it will hold up from the cool fuel passing
through it.
	What I did mind was the quarter-inch of JB Weld that had gooshed up
inside the manifold when the side tubes were installed. I couldn't see
it until I shined a flashlight down in there. It looked almost like a
weld bead, except that it was a JB Weld bead... I used a long
screwdriver to knock most of it loose, but there were still a few edges
left where a screwdriver tip could gain no purchase. 
	I tried to knock the rest out with a socket (like maybe a 13/16&quot; or
1&quot;???) having the correct OD... but ran into another problem. The tubing
that was installed as a part of the center manifold section was made
from sheet metal... and the metal, once rolled into a cylinder, was
robot-welded on the inside... so, I had trouble pushing the socket down
in there until I ground a tiny groove in the side of the socket (yes, I
made sure it was an SAE size...) to allow it to fit easily in the tube. 
	That took care of that...
	The next problem was one of the kewl chrome air cleaner... It would be
fine, I suppose, but for a diaphragm assembly or something like that
that will not let the air cleaner sit perfectly flat upon the top of the
carburetor. Two extra gaskets later, it sits flat and now prohibits
unfiltered air to access the inside of the carb. 
	Bob Hoover says that a Weber progressive, properly set up, will blow
the doors off of dual Kadrons... but that the manifolding and filters
are jokes, for the most part. I just thought I'd add my 2 cents worth of
recent experience to that. 
	The excess JB Weld would have obstructed the flow in the intake... and
would have no doubt caused all kinds of problems when it started to come
loose after so many heat cycles. *Continuous* adjustment and jetting
problems together with valve problems from chunks of the stuff would
probably lead many people to say that Webers and VWs are worthless. The
motor would also lead a relatively shorter life due to the gaps between
the air cleaner and the top of the carb.

PS... While I was searching the 'net for dual carbs to fit SP heads, the
alta vista search engine told me that maybe I should be looking for
&quot;carobs&quot; instead of carbs... I think my chances of finding dual carobs
for SP heads aren't good at all ;)
