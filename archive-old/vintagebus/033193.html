The wiper motor in my bus seems to not work anymore. I've got some 
more around here I can put in it's place. My bus is doing the 12 volt 
thing though. I'm aware of all the voltage drops and such I can do. 
But I'm curious.

you bench tested it with a battery charger?  

I dislike the 65 on style bracket wiper motors.  PITA when the pivots break.  
 and the 64 and earlier pivots dont tend to break.  ya self parking is nice.  
 the 66/67 two speedo doesn't sound bad    But the 64 and earlier wiper 
motors are easier to come by and replace bits of.    ya- voltage drop.   Or 
replace your wiper switch with a reostat style one by Cole-Hersee
