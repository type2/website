Subject: Re: [VB] Ride in a bus.

Thanks Karl,

I am beginning to think just that. But what is there?  Engine, Transmission,
reduction gears. Tranee mounts. The engine is new from the case up,
transmission and reduction gear boxs were rebuilt by Rancho, and all the
tranee mounts are new.  I now have a whopping 549 miles on it since all the
new stuff was installed.

There is a lot of exhaust and engine noise and low frequency rumbling as
well as some gear noise.

Do you have that photo of your steering wheel?

Chris



&gt; You have to have something wrong mechanically.
&gt; I had a 67 standard that I drove completely empty. It was VERY quiet.
&gt; My 66 hardtop deluxe is quiet. My 67 camper is quiet. None of them have
any insulation at all.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
 At this point, my bus interior is fully lined with dynamat extreme and JCW
 Heatshield insulation. That is: doors, roof, walls, and floor. I don't
think
 that the passenger buses had even close to that.  I have not yet installed
the plywood camper interior. Noise is bad enough that ear plugs are a must
have  on the highway.

Chris
