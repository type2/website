Subject: Re:[VB] jerome

No worries craig!
She was a friend of a friend etc that came along. An abrasive, sandlot type of girl, so i expect
that she would say something like that! She doesnt deserve an apology since she acts the way she
does sometimes.   Besides, sh!t happens and were talkin about the rock hill of death, so all bets
are off anyway! Every man for himself. hah.
See you next year
