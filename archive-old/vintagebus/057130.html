Subject: RE: [VB] Sold, 1954 Barndoor, $1825

$1825?!?!?! Made me laugh!! I wonder if that bid is 
a bad joke? Geez, what is this world coming to?
--------------------

Oh *DONT* get me started! ;-0!!!!
In theory someone could sell ten-twelve of these gems and &quot;make&quot; as much as
another theoretical person selling one unit that is nice but &quot;high priced&quot;.
Most probably with more real profit.

During my childhood, my dear dead Daddy, the eternal Willie Lowman type
salesman, kept trying to teach me me as a child two lessons: 
Lesson 1: A quick nickel is better than a slow dime. 
Lesson 2: It's better to make money with someone else's money. 

I know the lessons, am endlessly am able to help others to follow them but
somehow don't follow them myself. &lt;major sigh&gt; See you all at Kelly Park.
