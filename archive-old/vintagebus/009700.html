Hi all,

Has anyone ever heard of a kit that you could use
to make you own rubber parts?  I'm looking for something
that would let you make a mold of an existing 
part and pour a new one? It would be great to be 
able to make your own instead of paying $20
for a *used* Empi camber compensator axle pad.
Not that I mind looking through hundreds of boxes of 
VW junk at a swap, but there are some things you just 
*know* your not going to find first.
Any chemists out there with an idea?
