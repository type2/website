So I was on my way to a hardware store to get a few pieces for the roof
rack clips im making when ..... what - no headlights -  sh*t.  Anyone
have any ideas as to what I should check first.  The fuses all appear
fine.  None of the head lights work ie. not the high or low beam nor the
running lights, though the signal lights are working fine hmmm.

Since tightening up the bolts on my transaxle case stopped the leaking
transmission oil %100 I think I may look around at my steering box -
maybe there are a few bolts around there that I can tighten up.

TIA
