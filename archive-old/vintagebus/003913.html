Subject: NQ got himself a Mavica Camera

After considerable research and an education from a guy who I called in
Texas who had a Mavica for sale in the thrifty nickel (but sold it before I
got it), I decided to get me a brand me Mavica FD73.  Rob Laffoon in Omaha
has one and his pictures are always great to look at so now between the both
of us, we can snap shot an entire show and document it all online.

I'm gonna have to ebay quite a few parts to pay it all off but man it's
worth it to have this camara!  If anyone is interested in how to get one of
these brand new for about $375 (free shipping!) - email me and I'll tell you
a few tricks.  You have to spend time looking but the results are well worth
it!

Later!
