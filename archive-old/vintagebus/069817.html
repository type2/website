Subject: Re: [VB] side scoops any opinions

&gt; Maybe the term necessary instead of beneficial would be better.
&gt; It is a major design change cosmetically as well a structurally.
&gt;
&gt; Are the panels from a 63 and a 64 bus that different? I was commenting on  splits at that point, but I can see a huge difference between split and bay panels.

Mixing up arguments could be confusing :)

And no I agree that between 63 and 64 sure isnt much of a change.
