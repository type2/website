Subject: Re: [VB] electric fuel pumps

Hey Chuck,

I recommend the rotary non-FI pump available from dune 
buggy suppliers or is there a junk-yard type that's 
equivalent?
Others have said that the solid state unit makes a lot 
of noise. 
Mount it to an outrigger under the tank because it's a 
pusher not a sucker. Tank -&gt; filter -&gt; pump -&gt; carbs. 
The '63 DC had it near the engine and caused problems 
when the tank was less than half full. Truck tanks are 
very low so it may not be a problem on a bus.

&gt; Going to help a buddy change out his blown carbed 1800. He's got a good FI
&gt; short block. Anybody know the best type/way to mount an electric fuel pump?
&gt; thanks guys
