Subject: Re: [VB] Who knows about &quot;Kustom Kamper&quot;

Someone may be able to correct me, but that looks a lot like the bus that
was owned by that Olympic medal guy (sorry for the vague description).  I
read about it in one of the VW mags (Trends I think).  Maybe someone can
correct me on this as I still have all of my back issues packed away in
boxes.

Later
Charles

Subject: [VB] Who knows about &quot;Kustom Kamper&quot;


&gt; I have a '61 panelvan camper conversion, which I have finally identified
as
&gt; being a &quot;Kustom Kamper&quot;.  Does anyone know anything at all about this
&gt; company.  Where they were located?  Do they still exist?  Does anyone have
&gt; any literature?  Any other &quot;Kustom Kampers&quot; out there?
&gt; Any info at all would be greatly appreciated.
&gt;
&gt; My bus can be seen at this link:

&gt; Thanks.  Don...
