Subject: Re: [VB] blurred plates

Because in some locales, it's possible to track down the 
with just the plate #.  They probably don't want people
showing up in the middle of the night to &quot;borrow&quot; the
car.  There was a famous case in California years ago,
where a guy took down a chick's plate #, went to DMV, got 
her address, then went to her house and did bad things to her.

&gt; I've noticed that a lot of cars for sale on the 'net
&gt; or in online auctions have the license plate removed
&gt; or purposely blurred-out in the pics.
&gt; 
&gt; Why is this?
&gt; 
&gt; Is there some risk involved with people knowing your
&gt; plate?
