 The paint I was using really bothered my eyes.
And the fumes - I can still remember the hurt from going into the garage
a few hours after shooting, and still feeling a burn in my chest!

Listen up people.  If you are spraying a two part epoxy paint/primer, you are going to be exposed to isocynates!  The type of canister mask Thom used with or with out a face shield WILL NOT filter out isocynates.  The only truly safe way to spray these systems is to use a positive fresh air breathing system!  If you don't you're just shortening your life significantly!  

Don't trust your paint supplier to tell you the truth either, I've had counter jockeys tell me &quot;oh yeah, that mask  right there will filter out everything&quot;.  Times have changed since the days of lacquer folks.
