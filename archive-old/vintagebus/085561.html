Subject: Dorper Top Woes

Dorper top is on and appears to work. Originally I was going with a Dorper top
that was smaller than the one I used. That smaller one had a small aluminum
roof vent (8&quot; x 8&quot;) that I repainted and it operated with a chain ... I
replaced the screen etc.. it was cool ... but it didn't seem to work that well
... so I pulled it off and put the other Dorper top on. It is larger and
instead of a small 8&quot; x 8&quot; roof vent it's got this huge 12&quot; or 14&quot; roof vent
and it is fugly. My plan is to eventually make a new roof vent. I'd like to
maybe make a really low profile roof vent with a plexiglass top ...

Anyway, so I really wanted to use westy hardware to hold the top down but it
just wasn't going to work .. so I went with the Dorper type hardware. My
question is .. wtf is the small leather strap for. I'm pretty sure it is part
of the Dorper hardware and .. if you look .. you can see that it is sort of
molded or marked where it fit around the screw to the side thingy ... anyway,
so far so good .. I think I'll pull it off this weekend and put another coat
of urethane on the baltic birch ... I'll lightly sand it first and maybe get
the edge ready for the fabric ...

(OK - not &quot;fin&quot; but I can stop thinking about fastening this thing down)
