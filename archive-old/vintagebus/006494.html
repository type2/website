Hi Everyone,

The annual &quot;Volkswagen of America Heritage Show&quot;  is this weekend in North
East Florida. The show is held annually on beautiful Amelia Island (32034).
It's this Sat. and Sun..._dot_cars will line the downtown streets to the harbor.

October 22-24 1999  Phone: 904/261-0407

Last year's &quot;Best of Show&quot; was the 913? custom Splitty...I believe it is in
one of the Volkswagen mags this month. Customs make me nauseous, but the guy
did do a very good job on this ride.  It's a maroon and red early bus
powered by a Porshe engine and he calls it the nine something.
I'll have my '55 Single down there..it's a kinda primer Dove Blue.  If
anyone is subscribed to the other vintage lists re: type 1 and bays, please
forward this note to them for me.

Directions:

&gt;From I-95 take exit 129 Fernandina Beach/Amelia Island, head west on A1A, go
straight all the way to downtown Fernandina Beach. You'll see the signs and
show...it's a small island :-)

Scenic route coming from the south:

Take A1A up past St. Augustine to Neptune Beach, follow the signs to the
Mayport ferry, Cross the St. Johns river on the ferry and and make a right
back onto A1A. Head about 25 miles north on A1A and you'll cross long bridge
leading on to Amelia Island. Should be signs leading to the show from this
point. If not, just keep going straight until A1A &quot;T's&quot; and you have to make
a right or left. Go right, then straight to downtown and you'll see the
show.

Amelia Island/Fernandina Beach is 30 miles North of Jacksonville, Florida.

-Tom
