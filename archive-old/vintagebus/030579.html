This is the site for construction of a Hoover Bit

http://www.type2_dot_com/~andy/hbit.html

We made one on a type IV doghouse

At the VW parts store there was not any question on &quot;which&quot; thermostat we
needed (for 1600 sp) only one choice

We used a non-doghouse flaps BUT did have to work meticulously to get the flat
metal rod/strap that connects both (left and right) flaps together to work and
clear all. Not much room check it many times!  Check it with the sheet metal on
the engine.  Type IV or doghouse cooler decreases the clearance.

Make sure you have the captive nut for the engine mount behind the oil cooler.
It really is almost impossible to get to after you put the engine in.  We know
this from first hand experience.  We ran on 3 bolts for a while until we pulled
the engine again.  This is actually the way we got it, with only 3 bolts thanks
to the PO.  He left the starter bolt out.  It ran that way for 6 months for us.
