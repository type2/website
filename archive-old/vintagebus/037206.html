Hello all. Well I took my bus on a little road trip today and things
happen. I made my first stop for gas and noticed that I was leaking oil
pretty bad. The  oil  is coming from in front of the oil drain at one of
the case connection bolts. When the engine is running it will drip once
every 10-15 seconds, but when i turn off the motor it really starts
dripping. What the heck is going on? I tightened all the nuts and bolts
in the area but it didn't stop the leak I changed the oil and adjusted
the valves this morning before leaving and everything seemed fine.  What
course of action do I need to take from here? I stoped every so often
and added oil and checked it and made the trip there and back but now
I'm a little nervous Any and all help would be GREATLY appreciated.
Thanks.

Shawn
