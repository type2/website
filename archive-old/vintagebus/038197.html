&lt;&lt; well, I would not worry too much about whether the guy calls it a kombi or 
a 
 microbus or whatever.   Those terms, while one certain circle mean certain 
 models, in other are just another word for bus.  If he says it has 13 
 windows, it probably does.   if he said there is no middle seat, ditto, but 
 like you say it could have walked away at some point.     &gt;&gt;

Some people count each piece of glass in the door too!
