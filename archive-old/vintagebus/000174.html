&lt;&lt; OK, so I got these safari's on our bus, managed to get them off the 
 bus and onto my workbench. Now I need to get the frames off the 
 glass. I see the two screws on each side that I supose is holding
 the frames together, but they seem to be frozen solid and of some
 soft type of metal. Now the question, should I soak them with wd-40
 and the like and hope they come loose, or just get the drill and an
 ez out?
 
 If I go the drill route, what kind of screw's are they? machine, or 
 sheet metal?
 
 Any other tricks I need to know to get these things apart?
  &gt;&gt;
soak w/ liquid wrench, find the right size screwdriver, and tap gentley a few 
times. Tapping helps shake the rust loose.

carefully- no smashing, especially if you have original safari glass.

Repeat daily for at least a week.

patience in undoing it will make it easier to put it together.


I did this getting the pop out windows out of my westy.   So much easier than 
when there is a time frame  like with junkyarding.
