And the best vehicle in this category is a VW Westfalia.

Crank the side windows wide open, open all the windows and vents up front,
and hit the road.  Even stopped at a light, etc., this setup seems to
capture even the slightest breeze and route it through the bus's interior.

FWIW.....

&gt;&gt;  Much better to have a vehicle that doesn't gain so much heat when parked
and which has excellent ventilation when under way.  &lt;&lt;
