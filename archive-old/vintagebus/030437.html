We are using  a ? 74 ? beetle speed-o-pod with with the gas gauge and a p/n 211
xxxxxxxxx sender in the 15 gal tank, the 59 bus is converted to 12 volts. We
installed a 10 ohm 5 watt resistor in line with the sender and now we have a
gauge we can read to with in 1 gal. all through the entire range.
One sender was trash because the sending/guide wires inside the sender did
break.
The tank does go in with a good push and we do not think it has been dented,
but you do have to work a little harder to get out.  We have done this several
times to get it right.
Watch the wires when pushing the tank in because it is tight, this is done with
the tank output not installed until after installing.

P &amp; C
59 DDR w/t w 65 ez camper 12 volts and a good gas gauge


&gt;
&gt; How does the fuel guage work with this set-up?
