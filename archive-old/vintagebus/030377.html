In the back of the West Coast Metrics catalog there is exactly what your friend
is looking for.. and more, I think. Just saw them last nite while going thru
the catalog myself. (west coast metric inc. 2000 catalog, page 264, part number
111.0201, desc: sticker, Sun Burst, Yellow)

&gt; A friend of mine is getting a VW Thing and she wanted me to try and find her
&gt; a sticker.  I don't know what she's talking about but she said some guy in
&gt; Omaha last year was selling them and ran out before she picked one up.  This
&gt; is her description:
&gt;
&gt; &quot;Have you ever seen that bumper sticker with the sunshine and the VW emblem
&gt; in the middle?  Do you know if there is a picture of it online?  I've been
&gt; looking for it.&quot;
&gt;
&gt; Anyone know of a URL of a place that has these available for sale?  Pass it
&gt; my way if you would please.  Thanks!
