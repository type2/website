Subject: [VB] Dual circuit master cylinders

&gt; &gt;Has anyone else fitted a dual circuit master cylinder other than the late

&gt; &gt;bay m/c?  Oldspeed say this shouldn't be used as the master cylinder has 
&gt; &gt;the wrong diameter piston ( I think it is 24mm instead of 23mm)&lt;

&gt;I run the Old Speed 944 kit as well on my '66.  It kicks butt!!!

I think it was your comments that encouraged me to definately get one - I
first saw it on a bus in the UK earlier in the year and thought I want I
want!

&gt; First off to calm any convern the brake lines will bend to fit a baywindow

&gt; M/C conversion using the Wolfgang Int adapter plate.  If you need a &quot;T&quot; 
&gt; piece Rocky Mountain or Bus Depot (dropped from RMMW -but $1 less) has
them 
&gt; new.

I have left it a bit late to order this now - what does the kit include?  
I am sure on the type2 tech pages someone had done it themselves - anyone
done this instead (don't have web access only email on my laptop)?  I am not
too bothered about the brakelines not fitting as I was intending on
replacing these as they look to be original.

&gt; There is zero problem with running the bay M/C as it was designed for 
&gt; disc/drum setup.  The only concern would be if you have chicken legs and 
&gt; cannot depress the pedal with a little more effort with a 24mm plunger.  
&gt; Seriously though you will not be able to tell a difference.  Usually
larger 
&gt; plungers take more &quot;leg&quot; w/o power assist.

So is this what you are currently running then?

&gt; In the future I plan to add 944 rear brakes on small nut RGBs and run the 
&gt; 944 MC with it for better F/R modulation.  The 944 MC is really a design 
&gt; work of art... I will not bore anyone with the details.  Hopefully the
rear 
&gt; brakes should arrive today or tomorrow :)  As a side note a 944 resivoir
is 
&gt; need on this MC as no VW part will fit, the overflow nipple needs epoxy 
&gt; plugged as well.

My plans were also to go for rear brakes as well, but with IRS not RGBs.
Have you offered up the MC to see if it fits yet?  Will the resivoir line up
with the hole in the floor?

Thanks a lot
Paul
