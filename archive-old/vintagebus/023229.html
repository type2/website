&gt; If anyone is interested, my neighbor has a 1967 split-window for sale. 
&gt; It's located in the Florida Panhandle and is aqua and white.  It has a 
&gt; rebuilt motor and transmission. There's some rust on the bus but not a 
&gt; lot.  It runs great and she's parting with it sadly.  Her asking price 
&gt; is $7,000.  If you or someone you know is looking for these increasingly =
&gt; rare gems, let me know.  Thanks.
