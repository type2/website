Subject: Re: [VB] Was Picture Window...now Klaxon horn

Hey Taylor,

Cool bus! I'm enjoying looking at the pictures as you go.

I may have got lucky and found a very simular camper. I know it's got 
the big picture window on one side and that it was originally a 
panel. Although, it looks like an earlier bus (bullets I believe). I 
REALLY need to go get it before too much longer or I might lose my 
chance.

Anyway, I noticed you had a Klaxon horn like the one I have 
(ironically mounted in the same place under our busses). Did you ever 
get yours to sound right? I was always expecting more of an &quot;ooh-gah&quot; 
but ended up with a &quot;rrraaahhh&quot;. I dropped the voltage to it to 6 
volts and got a little better sound. But not really what I thought 
it'd be. I've also got a relay hooked up. didn't make a bit of 
difference in the sound...really.
