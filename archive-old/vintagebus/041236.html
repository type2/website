I have a BN2 installation manual that shows stock installation for everything from Beetles to Buses to Singlecabs. I *think* it even shows stock install for crew cabs, but I'm at work and the book's at the house. 

BTW, I have the BN2 up for sale for $100 or best offer. Comes with a full set of spare parts and the install and service manual...as well as installation parts for a beetle. The fuel pump needs a little work (or installation of the spare, maybe), as it leaks. The heater is currently 6 volt, but all that it needs for conversion to 12 volt is the replacement of 2 coils with standard 12 volt coils. I'll be glad to negotiate if someone wants it and is short on funds or doesn't think it's worth the asking price. I need to come up with some money anyway to fund the purchase of a cooler/stove, so if you act fast, you can get a real bargain on this.

Thanks! Joe
