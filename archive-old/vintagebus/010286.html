Subject: Re: [VB] More bad manners

As an American I am pretty damn sure that my view of what is going on in the
rest of the world isn't 100% accurate.  Not because I don't listen to the
news but because the news I hear has been Americanized and filtered before I
hear it.  I'm also pretty sure big business has too large and too tight of a
hold on our government.  I think most reasonable people will agree with
that.

However as a reasonable person, albeit somewhat misinformed and manipulated,
I still know Peace can only be brought about by those who want to be
Peaceful.  Sending (at least) four airplanes on a suicide mission to kill
thousands of unsuspecting citizens and cause mass chaos does not send the
message &quot;Hey, let get together and chat about our differences.&quot;  These
people are not just after our government.  They want to kill as many of us
as they can and destroy our way of life.  You can blame it on US foriegn
policy, US arrogance, or what ever you want to but those are the facts.  I'm
neither a pacifist not a warmonger, but it is evident these folks don't want
to settle their differences with us across a negotiation table.  Any person
or group which would kill 1,000's of unsuspecting citizens once, will do it
twice.  The pattern of Bin Laden is of escalting violence.  It may be 10,000
or 100,000 or 1,000,000 next time.  If he acquires nuclear capabilty,
without question, he'll use it on the United States if presented with the
opportunity.  He must be stopped before it gets that far.
