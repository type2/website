&lt;&lt; HAven't been able to find this in Bently's, does anyone know the outside
 dia of the 6v flywheel teeth, and the 12v? &gt;&gt;
Hi Jim,
We can tell you that the template/tool for the grinding job for a 12 volt 
flywheel that we have and it's blueprint calls for a length of 281.9mm 
plus/minus 0.05mm.  Unfortunitly we do not have a 6 volt flywheel at hand 
right now.  Eric&amp;Barb
