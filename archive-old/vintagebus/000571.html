&lt;&lt; Was just kinda curious, did a '62 SC, or Bus ever come with reverse 
lights? Dealer option? I really like those new contraptions..... &gt;&gt;
Hi David,
There was a dealer/factory back up light for the drivers side only.  These 
were around in the late 1950s to early 60s, and were a flush body mount 
simular to the late 1967 and later standard bus.  Eric&amp;Barb
