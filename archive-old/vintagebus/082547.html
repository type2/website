Subject: Re: [VB] sun visors

&gt;.........   Sounds like you got a set of TMI repops
&gt; with the bus. Do they look newish. I quit selling the TMI (bus) visors due
&gt; to
&gt;&gt;&gt; there inability to stay in place. Hopefully one day they will fix this
&gt; problem. A little piece of velcro will help till you find
&gt;&gt;&gt; some originals
 
&gt; Guess I might be lucky, I've never had a problem with the TMI visors. Bugs
&gt; or buses that I've run them in.
......

I agree w/ Ronnie, I've got a set of the repros that I took off cuz they
won't stay in place. I think they are TMI, But not positive.
