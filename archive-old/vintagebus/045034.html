 OK, you guys pooh-poohed the swivel seat I found on Ebay a couple of days
 ago.  Here's another item *I've* never seen before, but no doubt many of
 *you* have.  :-)  A dual generator stand!  Genuine Bosch.

 Since there are bound to be a few of you running one of these on your bus
 or schwimmenwagen, can you give some of the interesting details on setup?
 What is the second generator?  Is it a special one?  How about the pulley?
 Does any of the standard schrouding interfere with the v-belt?
 Thanks!

cool item.   I saw the dual generator set up on a wierd blue bus in Bad 
Camberg that had been converted into a radar  bus with an extra door on the 
passenger side front of the bus. look at

but I couldn't find pics of the engine with the dual gen set up all set up, 
any one got some?
   Don't remember if the tin was differnt, but what about the pulleys- you 
would need a different, double crank pulley.  and the gen pulleys would need 
to line up with teh crank pulley, off set ness?

it's small diameter too,  whooo hooo.
