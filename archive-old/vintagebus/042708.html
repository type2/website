hi e&amp;b,

I have a late 61 mangobus with no e flasher (it was made maybe spring of 
61, which would be halfway through the model year..)

My friend has an even later 61 deluxe made toward the end of production,
and it has an e-flasher... (i'd guess his was made summer 61..)

No idea if its factory installed or not... he has a gas gague too...

take care,

Steve
