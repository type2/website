&lt;&lt;SNIP&gt;&gt;

This is true, they don't work well at all with the 009.  Unless you 
&quot;improve&quot; it by putting a rivet in the throttle plate hole, crank the
accel pump as high as it will go...ugh.  I would never run a 34 and 009.
Did once.  It sucked.

Everyone I talk to that notices the 34 clamped on my intake suggests
I throw it in a dumpster.  So it would seem that lots of people on
the list and elsewhere have trouble with them, and I'm just a lucky
guy with an accident-waiting-to-happen for a carb :-)

It Works For Me (tm).  Apparently, YMMV by a great deal.  But nevertheless
you won't catch me with a 30 PICT-X on my DP engine.  Unless, of course,
the 34 does clog up and proves impossible for me to clean.  Then I'll
make the switch.
