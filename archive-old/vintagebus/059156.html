&gt; (&quot;thickness&quot;). For example, it makes no difference whether it's 10W-40
&gt; petroleum or 10W-40 synthetic, at -25 degrees centigrade (-13F) and 100
&gt; degrees centigrade (212 degrees F) the oil has to maintain a standardized
&gt; viscosity or it can't be rated a 10W-40.

Actually there seems to be some difference between the way they act.  The
synthetics tend to be more stable and not change so much with temperature.
According to Redline their 10W-40 oil will be something like a 5w when
cold and 50 when hot.  I don't understand it, maybe it is BS, but the
stuff does seem to work well.
I just got my butt kicked jamming the 2L into the 58 yesterday.  Hopefully
fixed a trans leak that turned out to require removal of transaxle.  Put
that back in, did some modifications on the front tin for the 2L so I can
hopefully scoop up some air going down the road and not have to transfer
the entire oil cooling set up from the 67.
Back to the synthetic now.  About midnight last night I put in 6qts. of
Redline 15w-50. Let's see 6 X $8.50, nope it's not real economical, but I
do have a K&amp;N FF filter on it.  I was running 10w-40 redline before and it
definitely did well.  This stuff was much thicker looking.  I hope I
didn't over-do it, but if I go across Needles to LA I figured I could use
it.  If you use synthetic be sure your rings are real well broken in.
I'm breaking in the 1679 engine on the 67.  I have the harness for head
temp so I will probably put a sensor on one end and gauge on the other
before using synthetic in it.  I'd like to run a comparison myself, but my
seat of the pants experience is that synthetic is a good thing.

Wishing I had a hydraulic lift, it's advil time.
