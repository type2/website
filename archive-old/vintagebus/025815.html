Tom,

I'm working on a later model tranny right now (64-67) to get the shifter
moving... 

I think the first thing I would check in your situation would be the
shift coupler on the front of the transmission. It has 2 square headed
bolts, one on the shift rod going to the front, the other to the rod
coming out of the nosecone. Make sure both bolts are tight. Check to see
that the coupler isn't broken (though it has been my observation that
splitty couplers are much more robust that bay couplers). If everything
looks ok there, I'd check the front part of the shift linkage, below the
cab. I haven't yet had to work on mine, so I can't give you much advice
there, except to look for excess play... If all that looks solid, then
the next step is to check out the action in the nosecone...

That's where I'm at, at the moment. 

I've heard of worn out or broken hockeysticks (the thing that sticks out
of the nosecone that is bolted to the shift coupler). You have to pull
the engine and tranny, then pull the nosecone cover off to get to it. It
sounds complicated, but its not really as bad as it sounds (though it
can be a pain in the ass to have to do all that, especially if you are
new at it)... Hopefully you find the problem before you get to that
point.
