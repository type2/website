Hi Volks,

A month or so ago I got a nose clip from a splittie bus.  Since my class
room is filled with VW paraphernalia, I was thinking of using the clip as
my podium ;0)  It's a little hard to make math an interesting subject, so I
thought I might be able to living things up a bit.  I was thinking about
wiring the lights and turn signals to flash when a student made a correct
answer.  Does anyone have old fried egg turn signals and a pair of head
lights that the would like to donate or sell cheaply?  I would appreciate
the help.  Thanks.

PS  I did use the displacement of a Volkswagen engine to teach direct
variation.  The kids got a kick out of it ;0)  


Joy thru air,

Jamie
