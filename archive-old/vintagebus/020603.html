'61 sits every patiently in the basement, keeping the '59 Beetle company,
as I steal parts from both to humbly offer to Gretchen.  I've asked for
another trip and she scared me with the axle drip, but you guys helped
her not get the best of me.  I told her I'd repaint her safaris and house
them in new rubber, so she's happy that I'm doing it.  Standing on three
legs and a jack while the new brake drum, which I pick up in 2 hours,
sits at the local VW guy's shop.  I'm stoked to see a new  &quot;Tom Connor
special&quot; 6 foot rack on top next week.  I bribed Gretchen by picking it
up there, (5 or 6 hours away, I think) so I'm confident she'll make that
first part of the trip without incident since she gets something new.

'61 can't wait for a new face, after a lovely 65mph introduction to
wildlife (namely, a deer) and there is a complete '59 (when I say
complete, I mean
there's-a-gas-pedal-on-the-floor-and-part-of-the-air-box-overhead
complete) sitting next to it.  One of these days I'll let the local
welder guy know he's in on it.  Had to close the Safari's because the
cats think the homemade seat cover (read: old bed sheets) is an awesome
place to sleep.  One day... one day...
