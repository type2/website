Education is only a part of the solution.
Information is part of the solution too.
This list is another.  PLEASE tell us who
you bought the bad part from.  The rest of
us will benefit from your misfortune.

Some more things you can do.
Inform the company of their shoddy parts, demand 
a refund, along with refunding the price 
you paid for sending
their parts back to them, and informing them
that you have informed a group of over 1000
people of your actions, and WILL report to
us the results of your request.  Believe me,
when I have verifiable information that a 
supplier is providing shooody parts or bad
workmanship, I tell everybody I can about it.

If they amicably work out this problem, I may
buy from them, if they don't work out this 
problem, I'll shy away, and they lose money.

These companies thrive on consumers being ignorant.
Informing us of the problem, and WHOM is at fault,
educates a lot of people.  Hit them where it hurts
and where they understand, in the pocketbook by
leting us know what is going on, in vivid detail.

Telling us that you got a good one at BAP helps,
for we need good stuff stories too.

&gt; the fuel pump push-rod wore out.  I bought a new fuel 
&gt; pump
&gt; push-rod at BAP that seems to be made of much better steel and which
&gt; has the cam end discolored from the hardening process.  The old 
&gt; push-rod,
&gt; that I put in 10,000 miles ago when I put this engine together did 
&gt; not
&gt; have a hardened end and obviously wore out because it was a poor 
&gt; quality
&gt; part.  Unfortunately, I didn't have enough experience to recognize 
&gt; the
&gt; difference when I built the engine.  I got the part mail order but 
&gt; will
&gt; not mention the specific company.
&gt; 
&gt; I don't see any reason that such a simple but important part should
&gt; be made this poorly.
&gt; 
&gt; Also, I don't see any recourse for the consumer.  I can call the 
&gt; the
&gt; mail order place from which I bought the part and complain but I 
&gt; doubt
&gt; that it would make much difference, shoddy parts such as this will
&gt; continue to be made.  I suppose the only way to combat this problem
&gt; is through education, if all the VW owners learn to tell a good 
&gt; part
