&gt;&gt;      I am only 15 and have dreamed for a long time about owning a bus,
and I have recently started reading 'The Sermons of Bob Hoover&quot; these
sermons have helped me in various ways learn the many responsibilities of
owning a bus, and restoring to as close to stock as I can get it.  I
don't feel Mr. Hoover should be bashed for providing a service that he
gives away to so many people and expects nothing in return.  Well that
was my two 
cents.

Thank You.
