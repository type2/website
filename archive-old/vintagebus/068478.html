&gt; All of my buses and even my F 250 diesel tow vehicle have passenger car
&gt; plates here in az, including my DD panel, DC, 15 window, 63 Westy, SC. My
&gt; cargo van (here in 2 weeks) and my 61 fire truck might be a different story,
&gt; I'll find out when I go to MVD


same in oregon. at dmv when i moved from washington they thought i was crazy trying to get 'truck'
plates for the pick ups. unless i wanted to pay thousands of dollars.  so i quickly agreed to the
$30/2year cost of passenger plates.
then i got the riviera and now i am a 'motor home' and pay an additional $114/2years based on
length in addition to my 30 dollars. so i guess all the good prices i got for 5 years eventually
catch up!
