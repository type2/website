Subject: driver's side mirror removal
Date: Tue, 14 Mar 2000 19:47:27 -0500
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

Hi volks,
The driver's side arm for my mirror is broken and I am trying to replace the
arm and all with an elephant ear.  How do you remove the arm?  I undid the
nut, took the weird washer with the two pointy things on either side off and
then another washer.  Am I missing something because it is not coming off....

Please help I like to see what is in that lane before I have to look to change
lanes.  This is on a 65 21 window deluxe.
 Also the mirror that came off is VW but it is round.  All the suppliers that
I have looked at don't list my mirror as being round.  Is it supposed to be?

Peace Brothers and Sisters,
