Subject: Re: [VB] Cabinet Templates

Hi Jim,
Thesamba_dot_com, left click on the &quot;Archives&quot;.  Next web page that  comes up 
will have a list of choices.  Under &quot;Type 2&quot; left click on  &quot;Brochures 
1949-1967&quot;.  Not Westies there all are listed under the  SO-#, so you will have to take 
a good look to find all of them.  A lot of  them have birds eye view drawing 
of the cabinet setups.
  If you can find a SO-33 camper interior that might be the way to  go.  This 
model camper interior was designed to be easily installed and  removed from 
Kombis, and sold separate from the bus at the dealership.
  You might want consider looking around for a panel camper  conversion, 
which there was many manufactures of camper conversions here in N.  America, or 
just get a model of Westie camper that you like.  Both of  these will probably 
be easier than making a quality interior, and in the long  run do much better 
in the resale market.
