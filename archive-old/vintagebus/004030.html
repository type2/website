&gt; When the AIRS site first went up I expressed my concern that it be
&gt; access limited. This is exactly why. So perhaps this is a well meaning
&gt; guy who would be interested in helping others in turn. But maybe not.
&gt; Neato doesnt publish the travel directory to non members and I dont
&gt; think this should be either. Opinions? 

Absolutely I have an opinion!
 
This is exactly why AIRS exists. This gentleman may or may not join AIRS and reciprocate. I for one want to risk it. My suspicion is that the percentage of people who get help and return it in kind will be high. Besides if I am the giver of the assistance, I often do not know if the other party does return in kind and I still go away with that wonderful feeling.

I will always be available regardless.
