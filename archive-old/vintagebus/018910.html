Carb *icing* is usually the term used.  What happens is that if you
don't have the pre-heat stuff working, under certain conditions, the 
temperature drop caused by the flow down the carb and manifold will
cause ice to form on the lower section of the carb and the manifold,
and cause rough running.  I used to have the problem on my '56: I'd
be tooling along, and as I picked up speed, the carb would ice up,
slowing me down until the ice melted, at which point I'd pick up
speed again - lather, rinse, repeat.  

The solution is to have the pre-heat tube unclogged, and any warm air
hoses hookedup.  What I did was use a bug rear tin with extra holes
open, so the engine would pull hot air off of the muffler.
