Subject: Re: Shipping bumpers to Europe

&gt;
&gt;Has anyone every shipped a set of bumpers from the US to Europe?  Due to
&gt;the size, I'm not sure how to go about doing this, who to use, etc..

Never done it, but I'd suggest that if the bumpers are nice enough to
make shipping them to Europe economical, you probably want to build
a crate for them.  2x4s and 1/2&quot; plywood would make a kick-ass crate;
1x3s and 1/4&quot; plywood would probably work.  Or at least, put them in
a box with packing material, then put that box inside a bigger box
with more packing material.

I have no idea on who to use, but I'd start with the &quot;usual suspects&quot;
of USPS, FedEx, etc.  FedEx, in particular, handles a lot more stuff
lately, and their site is pretty good about steering you to the right
service and giving you a quote.  Things will probably be a bit cheaper
on both ends if the package can be dropped off (by you) and picked up
(by the buyer) at a freight depot/warehouse.
