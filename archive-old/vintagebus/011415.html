Don't know what inspection takes on the east coast, heard it is pretty 
rough! Good Luck though...
As far as gas, there has been discussion on this in the past, and it 
seems that as long as your compression ratio is 7:1 or so, which should 
be for stock, you can run regular unleaded 89 octane. Sometimes on 
summer trips I spring for high- or mid grade, but usually use 89.

&gt;This may sound stupid......... but I'm really new when it comes to VW
&gt;engines.... what kind of gas does a regular stock 1600cc bus engine 
take? and
&gt;will I need to modify it in order to pass my inspection laws? (resident 
of NJ)
&gt;&lt;---- inspection sucks here.    Thanks alot for you time... please 
write
&gt;back...
