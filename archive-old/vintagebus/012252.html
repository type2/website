Hello bus people,

I have a 66 crew cab and I'm looking for a rear canopy set up.  It doesn't need to be original, but that would be cool too.  There was a guy at Pomona once who had repro sets, he even had different heights for the bars.  Unfortunately, I had a deluxe at that point and didn't get a name.  Can anyone help?

thanks,
dug
