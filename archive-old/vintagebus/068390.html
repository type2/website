Subject: Speaking of 67' Master Cylinders....

Greetings, All!

Perhaps I should first introduce myself. I had been on this list about three 
years ago when I owned my last bus, a 65' Deluxe. Well, needless to say, I 
took the plunge again and purchased a 67' Deluxe. I'm very glad to be back, 
this is a great list, with very helpful people. This bus came from California 
and was &quot;restored&quot; by a VW mechanic and son in Michigan. Anyway, it seems as 
though not all mechanical aspects had been taken care of. Upon receiving the 
bus yesterday and driving it home, the brake pedal was nearly down to the 
floor, stopping about 3/4 of the way down--this scared me to death 
(thankfully I'm only 2 miles from where I picked the bus up from). The PO 
told me that the brakes were completely gone through, with new drums being 
put on the rear and such. I'm still learning the &quot;Vw&quot; ropes so I'm a little 
bit confused as to what the problem is. It's rather disheartening as I was 
looking forward to jumping in the bus and taking it for a long maiden voyage. 
:)  But, I digress; anyway, I have adjusted the shoes, bled the brakes 
(though the PO did so a few months ago), and there didn't seem to be much air 
in the system. The master cylinder pushrod looks okay to me as well. So, I 
took a look at the master cylinder and found it to be a very, very old 
looking ATE one. Could this be my problem? How would I know if so? I have 
already order a new MC just in case, as these are hard to come by as it is. 
Any help would be greatly appreciated. :-)

Very Best Regards,
