Subject: westy louvered window seal

Hi lists.
anyone tell me if louvered window seal is available anywhere?
I know the Bay Westy's one is available but I dunno splittys.

Otherwise, are there any good idea to stop leaking from the louverd window?
The seal is shrunk and the window periphery is not completely sealed.

thanks for advance
Masaki
