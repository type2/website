&gt; Mine, installed in January with ~1000 miles now, if that, makes a funky

Cal here...

Mine (both of them Carters) did that from day one ( see Carters gearbox
fiasco in archives).


&gt;
&gt; Now I (and he) get to see what the so-called &quot;warranty&quot; looks like...


I will be testing the warranty next month or so, when Todd Hill delivers
my new tranny and I get to remove the Carter unit for the third time!

&gt;
&gt; It's a lot of work to install a bus transaxle; not something I want to
&gt; do over and over again until they get one right.

Oh, come on now, Thom, I 've done it three times now! My original whiney
Transform unit, and two trys with Carter units. Hopefully, Todd's
handiwork will fly.
