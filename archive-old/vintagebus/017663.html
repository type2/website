Hi all,

As we unpack from last weekends &quot;Busses Nowhere Near The Arch #16&quot;, we
realize we still have a few of the BNNTA Official Event t-shirts available
in case anyone missed getting one or missed the event entirely.  All are
short sleeve, and we have just a few L, XL, &amp; XXL sixes left.  The shirt is
a 100 percent cotton Fruit of the Loom white shirt with a 4&quot;x4&quot; red event
logo on the front left breast, and on the back side you'll find a five
color &quot;Fiftieth Anniversary of the Transporter - Busses Nowhere Near The
Arch 2000 #16&quot; design with two early Split windshield Barndoor Busses (a
23-window Deluxe and a Panel) featured in front of a stylized lake and
farmland scene along with the date and location.  These are nice quality
shirts that shouldn't shrink much unless you are a merciless user of your
clothes dryer.  

While they last, the L and XL size shirt can be packed and mailed to your
door (continental USA) for $15.  XXL for $16.

If interested, just p-mail me at:   BussesByTheArch_at_compuserve_dot_com   for
details.

Thanks to all out attendees for making BNNTA so much fun.  Despite all the
work putting this Transporter event on, I even had a lot of fun! 

Bill (&amp; Kathryn) Bowman
