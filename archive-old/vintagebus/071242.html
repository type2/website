Subject: brosol 30/31 adjustment ?'s

List,

I am puttint my brosol (solex) H30/31 back together and have some adjustment
questions.    First what are the two screws on the left side for?  One is
large-ish and brass (air flow?) and the other is on the small side, black.
Any adjustment tips would be most appreciated.
