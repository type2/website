&gt;Dear Folks,
&gt;
&gt;Jamie Rivers posted this message to the Vintage Bus list and as
touring/show
&gt;season is upon us, I think he's got a very good point -
&gt;&gt;&quot;Something I have never seen on the list is a List Name Tag


&gt;I Personally, I *hate* name tags, but I'd *really hate* not getting to meet
&gt;some of you


Ok,,,,, skip the tags and we can tie Purple balloons to our tails...



&gt;Maybe we could just do
&gt;some kind of highly recognizable logo (like the line drawing of the bus on
&gt;the Type 2 web site) and use that instead of plastering our names to our
&gt;chests...

I was looking forward to seeing all those chests!  wink*!


&gt;Just  a thought.
&gt;
&gt;Chris and Gus the &quot;WHEN ARE WE LEAVING FOR THE SHOW?!!!&quot; Bus


LEAVE NOW!   sleep when you get there

Meet me At the Yellow Bus   10 am  sunday
Jamie
