If you are running a 6V accessory on a 12 volt system it only takes a few 
resistors. If it is A 12V on a 6V system I've no clue. If it is the first 
situation P-mail me. I can help figure out what resistors are needed. I'm 
running my 6V wipers on a 12V system with a $4 power resistor. It's cheap 
and it works.
