Due to ongoing sales increases, The Bus Depot has an immediate opening for
one full time, or one or more part time, employees.  I am hoping that we can
find another VW enthusiast who would like to make his hobby a full-time
thing.  That is why I'm starting off by posting this message to the List.

Initially you will be doing mostly packing, shipping and receiving, but
after you have learned the ropes you will be dealing directly with
customers, recommending parts and taking orders, and handling customer
service issues.  Full time hours (at this time) are weekdays 11 am to 7 pm,
with weekends off.  Pay is about $12 an hour; no &quot;benefits&quot; but you do get
all the parts you need for your bus at wholesale.  You'll be working
directly with me and a handful of other employees; we're a pretty small
shop, both in physical size and employee number.

It's a fun job in my opinion, but I'll warn you, it can also be very
frenzied, with the phone ringing off the hook while you're running around
trying to get that one last box finished as the UPS driver impatiently waits
with one foot out the door.  90% of our business is mail-order, and things
never slow down from the minute we open 'til the minute we close. I'm not
exaggerating.  You need to be able to handle a very fast-paced, non-stop
atmosphere without pulling your hair out, or you won't like this job.  I
rely heavily on my employees and need someone who is responsible, motivated,
energetic, intelligent, and in this for the long haul.  The Bus Depot is
growing in leaps and bounds, so I think there is plenty of potential in the
long term for the right person.

We are located in Perkiomenville, Pa., about 1/2 hour from Allentown or
Pottstown, about 40 minutes from King of Prussia or Reading, about an hour
from Philadelphia.  Interested individuals should email me directly at
ron_at_netcarrier_dot_com.
