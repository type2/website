Hi Charles,
Along with the two body halfs of the turn signal switch there should be a 
metal piece that slides into the lever handle half after installing the 
switch innerds.  We apply a layer or two of electrical tape to the column to 
take up any slack.  This could also probably be done by sanding the body 
halfs some so they clamp tighter.
