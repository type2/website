Subject: restoration

This is a big weekend for me. As I posted earlier, I have cut a quarter
panel out of a donor bus. Last night, a friend told me he had brought a
plasma cutter home for me to use. So tomorrow morning, I am gonna try to

remove the bashed in quarter panel. This will not be an easy job, but
one that must be done.

But I also ran into a problem. I cannot get the drivers door open,
either from the inside, the outside or, with the window open, a
combination of the two. Any one have this problem before and can offer
me suggestions??

Les
