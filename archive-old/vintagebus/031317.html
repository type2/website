Both in garage, '59 under car cover (waiting for resto) full of parts with the replacement roof for the '61 piled on top.  '61 (really wondering what I'm doing to
her) is partially scalped, while I rework her drip rail and roof supports.

I thought the idea of owning two busses was to drive one while you fix the other one?  ...oooooops  both incapacitated, screwed that up, guess I'm driving the Ni**an
to Familienfest this year, Crap.

Later,
