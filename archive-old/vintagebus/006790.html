The problem is that trailer tires are just that, trailer tires not for
vehicals, I have been told that the plys in a trailer tire are layed up
differently than a passenger tire and that they will not hold up to the
turning of a passenger vehical and if you get in an accident due to a tire
failure you will have no recourse from the manufacturer and all the
liability falls on you and the dealer that installed them, that is why FOR
TRAILER USE ONLY is moulded in the tire.

ps, check on this with E and B, I think a while ago they posted that they
installed trailer tires on their bus, ask how they have been working.

Well,

their 4 wheel car haulers take a 7.00 15 bias ply.  Thats only about 1/2
taller than stock.

But... the tread is pretty much a highway rib, you'd slip and slide in any
bad weather, and im sure the rubber is as hard as a rock, so no traction
in wet.

Otherwise, a perfect tire.

take care,

Steve
