Subject: Re: [VB] '59 Single cab...bed is blasted!!!!

&gt;That's my '64 SC after I blasted the bed.  You could surf on those waves!!

Yeh, mines not wavy thankfully. But those dents in the ridges. What 
did you do about those? I don't want to use filler 'cause I'm gonna 
actually use the truck. If I use filler it'll end up just chipping 
off. As it is now I was gonna give banging 'em out my best shot...but 
won't expect much. And then just leave the bed &quot;rough&quot;. Other than 
welding in new metal...which I won't do....I can't figure anything 
else out.

So it'll be rough. No big deal. It's gonna be getting used.
