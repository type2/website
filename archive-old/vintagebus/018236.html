Subject: 62 door needed in florida
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

Any one have a 62 drivers door they want to sell? I
will be at the DKB show in tampa on the 11th and Bug
Jam on the 12th. I dont need the windows just the
door. I would preferr as rust free as possible and 
with good hinges.
Thanks
