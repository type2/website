Subject: Re: [VB] Axle tube in RGB box question

I looked at this once on my '65 crewcab with a big stub rear axel. I &quot;think&quot;
it is a press fit, which means you would need a press to remove it. Why do
you want to separate it?

&gt; What is involved in separating the RGB from the axle tube?  I understand
&gt; that I must remove the pin but what kind of force is needed after the pin
is
&gt; out?  Also, do I need special tools?
