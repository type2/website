I have just finished talking to Erin about this subject. I'm constructing a
30 by 48 metal building. The reason I chose this style is that it came
delivered on a truck ( I could fit the whole unassembled building in the bed
of a truck) is that I can expand in 2' sections if I want to. I plan on
having water and electric, a pit for water-cooled, a lift for air-cooled,
15'X 20' paint booth, the building will be 14'3&quot; tall so I'll have storage
on top of the paint booth. I'm borrowing a tractor to pre dig the pit and an
air vent for the downdraft part of the paintbooth. My son has access to
spray on expandable foam which will insulate the never- needs to be painted
building. I'll have about 6K in the building including paint booth.This has
been my dream garage/ Bus hoarding - storage shed for many years and I start
this week!
