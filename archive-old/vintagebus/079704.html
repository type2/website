Subject: RE: Gas tank size in a 65 bus

    I have a question I had a 67 deluxe a couple of months ago and I could
only get about 8 gallons in it. But now that I have my 65 deluxe on the road
I can put in about 10 gallons into the tank. What was the factory size of
these tanks? and maybe I have a bay window tank in mine.
 
 
Any thoughts,
Eric
