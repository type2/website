I hope you have blueprinted and documented all of this
for your webite! When is your &quot;dealership&quot; open for
business?! I could use one of those!

&gt; &gt; One question for you...  What axle assembly are
&gt; you using to get the wide
&gt; &gt; fives to fit on there?  
&gt; 
&gt; This has been one of those snowball projects...
&gt; 
&gt; At the last Bug-O-Rama I bought a home made utility
&gt; trailer that
&gt; provided the spring assembly and axle for this
&gt; project.  Someone
&gt; had taken an early American car axle and welded
&gt; early bug spindles 
&gt; to it.  The rest of the trailer was a POS, and I
&gt; started to try
&gt; to fix it, but gave up and started from scratch.  I
&gt; cut the springs
&gt; and axle of the first trailer and welded them into
&gt; the new one. 
&gt; 
&gt; So basically I'd bought a set of 15&quot; bus wheels and
&gt; an axle,
&gt; and threw the rest away.
&gt; 
&gt; I roughly modeled it after a westy trailer I saw at
&gt; KP, but I
&gt; thought it would be cool to make it a little bigger.
&gt;  It came out
&gt; 26&quot; high, 45&quot; wide, and 5' long  Hmm.  Then I ran
&gt; into an issue where 
&gt; the sides are too high to load anything heavy, so
&gt; now I'm engineering 
&gt; a tailgate for it.  I have a set of Westy-style
&gt; reflectors for it, and 
&gt; I wanted to use the 58-61 lights to match the bus. 
&gt; I also have an NOS 
&gt; Hella trailer connection setup for it, and will
&gt; re-engineer a bus jack 
&gt; to serve as the holdup for the tongue.
&gt; 
&gt; The metal for the new trailer ran me about $80, the
&gt; plywood was
&gt; another $100 for the nice sanded stuff.  I still
&gt; have to buy another
&gt; sheet of wood for the lid, and a couple more pieces
&gt; of metal to
&gt; finish the gate.  
&gt; 
&gt; I'm going to sand the wood a little smoother, then
&gt; coat it with the
&gt; plastic resin used for fiberglass, to seal the wood.
&gt;  After sanding
&gt; that down, I'll paint it to match the bus.  I'm also
&gt; going to coat
&gt; the inside with resin as well, to provide abrasion
&gt; resistance.
&gt; 
&gt; It's actually pretty light, and after putting new
&gt; wheel bearings in it,
&gt; it rolls very smoothly.
