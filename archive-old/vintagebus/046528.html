Subject: Trip Report (long): My Volksfest Weekend
Date: Mon, 14 Sep 1998 11:04:04 -0700

Hi everyone,

	This past weekend my kids and I headed east of Washington state's,
Cascade mountains for our first real &quot;VW weekend/campout&quot; in our '66
E-Z.  The town was Yakima, the event was Volksfest, the weather was
PERFECT and it was hosted by the Apple Valley VW club.  What a GREAT
event these fantastic folks put on!!  

	The trip started out rather slow since I missed the ferry to Seattle by
about 5 minutes so we started our maiden journey late and I knew that
would mean getting there and setting up camp in the dark.  And of course
this being our first road trip, I really didn't know just how loooooong
going over the mtn passes take in a loaded bus (read: 3rd gear _at_ 40
mph).  But the 145 mile trip went off with out a hitch.  On the advise
of Charles &quot;Luke&quot; Lukey we made the Yakima KOA our home for the next 2
nights and were not disappointed there where Saturday morning I met Luke
and several others from the Cascade Kombies bus club and my old friend
Dan &quot;the man&quot; Heidt and his wife Carla, Dan (the &quot;Bart bug&quot;) and Craig
(didn't catch Dan &amp; Craig's last names, sorry) representing the North
Whidbey VWs Unlimited Club that were all camping together.  Actually,
most of the sites along the dike were filled with VWs of all sorts with
the other end inhabited by many members of the Strictly German VW club.
Our site was kind of out of the way and was invited to move over and
join them, so of course we did!!  :-)

	Saturday I caravaned to the &quot;Thing Show&quot;/poker run/cruise with Dan &amp;
Carla, Dan and Craig in their bugs.  This was mainly billed as a type
181 show (FREE BTW) and had a very good turn out of things.  But there
was even more VWs in general.  Dan &amp; Carla and my &quot;crew&quot; went on the
poker run and had a great time navigating through the scenic area but,
not being much of a card player, my hand &quot;stunk&quot; (I'll just blame that
on my kids since they picked most of the cards ;-) ).  After the show my
kids and I went on the cruise with about 30-40 other VWs through the
miles of apple orchards (this is the apple capital, after all).  It was
a lot of fun to get in a line up like that with all those beautiful
VWs!!

	Saturday night after dinner and &quot;smores&quot; with the kids, I put them all
to bed and had a great time &quot;swapin' lies&quot; and socializing with all the
nice folks and checking out all the nice VWs.  Some of the VWs in the
camp included a '53 Barndoor Kombi (spotless resto), a '65(?) Westy
(awesome), a '66(?) ASI (very similar to my E-Z, but WAY nicer), two
bubble westies, my E-Z, the blue &quot;Bart bug&quot; Dan's '69 bug, Craig's red
bug, 2 beautiful low mileage Rabbit trucks and 3 other early 60s vintage
bugs (all squeaky clean).  The people were as nice as the VWs and a good
time was had by all.

	Sunday morning came WAY too early (after that night ;-) ) and we went
out to the park where the Volksfest was happening.  I don't know the
exact number but I would guess there was about 100-150+ VWs of all types
in attendance.  We were all parked on the grass, which was great, and
commenced to having a great time socializing with fellow enthusiasts.  I
particularly likes the setting because I was near the playground and my
kids could also get out and play too.  The folks at Apple Valley VW
provided a german sausage lunch w/ all the fixin's for all participants
and several were constantly giving away door prizes throughout the day.
They had kids games, valve cover races, a shady (as in: cooled by trees
:-) ) swap area and a vendors from all over and as far away as Arizona
(thing parts).  

	A VERY fun event hosted by a super group of people.  I met many new
friends and saw a few old ones too.  Many THANKS to the folks at Apple
Valley VW for hosting a real classy, family oriented event.  Being my
first VW weekend-get-a-way in our bus, we couldn't have had a better
introduction into the world of &quot;road trips&quot; than this one.  This will be
an annual event for my family from now on!!  And thanks to everyone at
the camp for making us feel so welcome even though we are not club
affiliated (yet)!!  See you all at Ocktobug Fest next month.

P.S.  Andy W., I would appreciate it if you could convey my hearty
&quot;THANKS&quot; to the rest of gang at Apple Valley VW for all your efforts in
making this event so successful.
