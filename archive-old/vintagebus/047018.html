i have an idea to make a four point harness for young children (not so much
for toddlers).  it would be used on a bench seat and would wrap around it so
that little to no mods are necessary to the car.  it would be great for all
classic car enthusiasts who want to preserve therir cars.  i have already
given it much thought and have a sketched it up but i will not share any more
with any of you because i don't want my idea stolen.
sorry, but does any one have any information on patents that they could send
me or tell me of any web sites to visit.  it would be greatly appreciated.  i
have many great ideas for tools and want to know how to protect them.  not
long ago i came up with an idea for a screwdriver that had a handle that could
be made into more or less a t handle for additional torque.  I just recently
saw it for sale.  My dad experimented with ideas for a weed wacker long before
they first showed up.  I guess if we should have jumped at the chance and
developed these things before someone came up with the idea.

thanks in advance
