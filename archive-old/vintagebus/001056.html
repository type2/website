&gt; Hi,
&gt;
&gt; Did you all know that Apple Computers was started with the
&gt; proceeds from the
&gt; sale of a VW Bus?  I don't know what year it was, but it was
&gt; a splittie.
&gt; That is the absolute truth.
&gt;
&gt; Chris

If you're basing it on the movie &quot;Pirates of Silicon Valley&quot;, that looked
like a breadloaf to me...Steve Jobs sold a '73 Westy to fund Apple Computer
as told in the book &quot;Fire in the Valley&quot; - the book that the movie was based
on.
