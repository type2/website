Why is there a problem?
Thats my friends bus. Its a fire breathing show car!
At the flick of a switch he can spit flames that engulf the whole bus.
He hasnt quite figured out how to stop it yet.

Anyone know whose bus this was?  It is burning at an Ultramar station (yes,
I work for Ultramar Diamond Shamrock) so is probably in California.
