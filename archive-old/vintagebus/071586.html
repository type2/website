Subject: Oil change - part III

Ok,

I changed my oil again last night (upgraded to a full synthetic and a bit
heavier oil)  I noticed that there is a metallic (copper) sheen to the oil.
It is pretty noticable.  I understand this is an indication of bearing wear.
How bad is this really?  should I be planning a rebuild sooner rather than
later?
