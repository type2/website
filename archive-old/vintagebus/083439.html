Subject: Re: [VB] Wheel question 15&quot; vs. 14&quot; on my 1963

Earlier I wrote:
 
 What is the ratio marked on the back of your speedometer?!!!!!
A bus that used 15&quot; wheels will have W0,77 stamped on the back.
A bus that used 14&quot; wheels will have W0,80 stamped on the back.
It will be stamped into the back of the speedo. The blue paint number is the build date.

I was cruising on the Samba and found this pic of a 1962 speedo:

You can see the 4,62 build date and the W 0,77 ratio 
It is a 15&quot; tire speedo.
