Subject: Cooked alternator?

While driving my 58 panel this weekend, I started to notice a really bad
smell.  I first thought it was the two barrels I had just picked up.  But
after I dropped them off, and the smell remained I got concerned.  This is a
smell I have never smelled coming from a car, ever.  Kinda like burning
manure.  After the bus failed to start in the Lowes parking lot (dead battery
kinda not start)  I started digging.  The smell seemed to be coming from the
alternator.  There is also a powdery substance that reminds me of brake dust
around the alt. pulley.  The smell also did not seem to disipate when the bus
was not running. I have disconnected the alt. and have mentally prepared
myself for getting a new one.  Any thoughts?  The enigine is a 1600DP.

Thanks

-Tom Purdum
