I really have no qualified mechanic in town, but I found one through a 
friend that is about 30 miles out.  I'm ready to take my bus to him for an 
engine rebuild.  The problem is my front left caliper is seized, and I blew 
a plug.  Both in the same day!  He'll rebuild my early 74 1700 cc for $900 
(good deal?).  So, how would you get the bus to someone?  I have the thread 
kit to use an insert on the plug, so that I could drive it to him.  Ever use 
one? Ever use a two-wheel dolley?  How'd it go?  Thanks in advance!

Dustin
