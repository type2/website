Subject: Successfull Kombi test drive!
Mime-Version: 1.0

So yesterday I upped the dial on my electric fuel pump regulator from the
(1) setting two clicks up on the dial to (2). I started the engine and it
ran fine for a while. This morning I fired the engine up again and it
started right away. Ran fine. I let it warm up and me and my 3 year old son
hopped in it and headed to the proofing grounds (our circle driveway!).

We drove around the circle about 10 times in 1st and 2nd. Everthing seemed
fine and I got the thumbs up from my wife to go for my little 1 mile test
drive. I'm lucky that I live in the country and my road is a 1/2 mile
dead-end straight shot road. Yesterday I died about 1/4 mile down the road.
Today I made it down to the end and back just fine. I drove in 3rd. I
didn't really want to go any faster 'cause I've only got my steering wheel
&quot;set&quot; in place and my brakes still need to be adjusted some. I've currently
got the oversized tires that were on the back (in the cut wheel wells) on
the front. They wouldn't fit back there after I replaced the wheel wells,
and I haven't bought a new set of tires yet. The back tires are mis-matched
and aren't in the best condition. So the ride was pretty bouncy and all
that. But it was still cool.

Why am I driving a bus in this unsafe condition? It's Ronnie's fault! His
side-loader single-cab got me all worked-up about driving my Kombi. 

I'm not sure if my fuel problem is fixed or not. Maybe there is junk in the
tank and I'll have a re-occurring problem until I clean it out. I'm not
sure right now. But I hope the fuel regulator was the problem. Regardless
I'm gonna clean up a tank I have that's got a fuel sender on it so it'll be
ready to  slap in there if I need to.

Thanks for listening!
