Subject: What, a stud?

While removing the old rusty exhaust from the 1600 SP I was surprised 
to find the bolts on the studs to the heads very easy to remove even 
though they had been in place for at least 12 years. Then I got to 
the last stud. It creaked and moaned. Terror washed over me as I 
imagined the struggle to drill out the broken stud and ultimately 
taking it to the machine shop. Chad brought the torch over from the 
work bench and advised that use a little heat. After getting the nut 
hot it began to turn. A squeak here and a groan there. After a few 
turns it was clear that the stud was coming out of the head with the 
nut firmly attached to it. I figure that was better then breaking it 
off :) I suspect I can get a matching stud at the fastener supply 
house but is there anything special to consider such as hardness of 
the stud or the material it is made from? Are there any special 
considerations to installing such as using loctite ?

Thanks
Chris
