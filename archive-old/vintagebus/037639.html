Subject: Tires for Early 15&quot; Rims


     I need to replace the tires on an early Panel Van, with 15&quot; bus rims.  
     I could go with the original bias ply 6.40 x 15 at a high price tag, 
     but would prefer radials, if possible.  But they need to be tall tires 
     to look right, and all I can find are low profile tires.  Anyone 
     bought radials that work well on early 15&quot; bus rims?
