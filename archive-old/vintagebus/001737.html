The part number you list is indeed RMMW's part number for a splitty poptop
seal, so if you read that off of the packaging you should indeed have the
right thing. No, their seal is not an exact duplicate although it is
functional.  I get my own post-67 poptop seals custom-made to my specs, so
they are a bit closer to stock, but even they are a bit different from the
originals.  I do not get enough demand for the splitty poptop seals to
support the quantities I would have to order if I custom-made them, so what
I ship is generally either the WCM or RMMW ones, which appear to be very
similar.
