&lt;&lt; How do you know the years?  is it stamped on the rim somewhere?  &gt;&gt;
Hi Doug,
All the VW rims we have dealt with have date month/year codes stamped in the

flat areas near the lug bolt holes.   Eric&amp;Barb

Lemerz (the crows foot ones) also have them on the inside (not visable when 
the tires on them), they dont always match.
I had a few dated on the face one month, and the inside another date, I
guess 
when they welded them together they grabbed whatever.
