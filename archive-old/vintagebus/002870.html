OK,
I ordered some carriage bolts that where the same dimension as the one I'm
missing for my double cab but it's just not right.  argh.

So, $25 to anyone with a correct carriage bolt, washer, and wing nut that
holds the rear seat pedestal in place in a 59 double cab.  Pick up an
additional $5 if you have two of the right 4 mm screws that hold the lens in
place of a bullet front turn signal (it must have the little starting clear,
non-threaded part at the end).

BTW, I'll trade you a few of the not-so-correct carriage bolts in return on
top of the cash.

Let me know.

David
