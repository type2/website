Subject: RE: [VB] Body work tool

  I couldn't do body work without my stud gun, gone through at least 1000
studs by now. I am getting ready to reopen the resto shop (I have a 1250
square foot warehouse I'm trying to clear out)time to get back in gear
(retired from resto work, Porsche, 6 years ago). I am going to get a new
style puller. This one has a 3 sideed star on the end of a slide hammer
attached to a power sourch. You just touch the tip to the metal, pull the
trigger and slide away, just give it a twist and it breaks off, a really
slick tool.

ronnie     bang, grind, pound.

ps. I just got a set of really nice body files from a friend that works at a
body parts stamping plant. His job is taking the dings and dents out of new
fenders, metal finish so you can't tell

       My stud gun is one of my more favorite tools.  Makes shrinking a 
breeze and I've also used to fill small holes.  On the creases and bigger 
pullers I like tacking some scrape on, clamp it, and pull with my Morgan 
Knocker (very large slide hammer).  There are all sorts of gizmos out there.


       The Dent Master is the next step up from a stud gun.  It has a single

replaceable stud that it uses over and over. Leverage comes from a bar with
a 
slot in it (the stud and handle go through the slot) and a small padded foot

on the other end.  When your done pulling you just twist the stud and go on 
to the pull.
       If you have money to burn there is a neat setup that welds a wire to 
the metal.  The wire looks like this WWWWWWWW     The bottom of wire is spot

welded to the panel, hooks go through the top for pulling.  This wire can be

bent to fit again any curve or dip.  Its a very neat toy.  It can also spot 
weld and shrink.
