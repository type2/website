&gt;well, you can try that or simply convert it natural gas.

I should wait till friday but wth. Natural gas or propane conversion on a vw 
is possible. But realize that it takes more space to hold the same amount of 
driving range, and in a tank that must be much stronger then what you have 
now.
I have seen a bus in Seattle running compressed liquid fuel, but they ran 2 
large tanks that ran the length of the bus on the roof.

More weight, and less power produced.
