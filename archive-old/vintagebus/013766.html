Like I said, it's a matter of where you want to spend the effort; if
I have a bus with rusty rockers, wiring all kapoiey, and super beelte
tailights sectioned into the back, and no brakes, the speaker would
be the LAST thing I did.

Unless I was flat broke, and I wasn't going to be able to do all the
other stuff for a while, then sure, break out the nail polish.  Since
I won't have the cash to go to the movies or buy beer, and afternoon
locked in the cab in the hot sun with a bottle of nail polish would
be just the ticket!
