Subject: VB steering lock
Date: Wed, 28 Jun 2000 22:02:36 -0500

I noted the posting on the broken lock cylinder in the steering column lock.
This is a very common failure as the metal is very thin at the bottom of the
plug, and is open at the top.  I do not know of an aftermarket part to
reair.  I've also tried to weld, epoxy, and JB weld these.  If you do buy
one of these and it comes without key, be aware that it is a very difficult
lock to work on.  The key blank is also difficult to come by.  There is no
code number on the lock to generate a key from, and due to the fact that it
has two locking positions, it is very time consuming to hand make a key.  I
normally charge $30 for a key generatio for these, assuming no other parts
are needed.  Please feel free to contact me for any other VW lock problems
or questions.
