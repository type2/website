Here's Rich Ligato's response to my message and questions about their
journey and vehicle.

I've written back with some more questions about the 1600 engine and some
other issues, and will post that reply when it is received.

FWIW.....

Hi Fred,

We checked on our Yahoo Group to find that our membership increased by a
bunch.  Thanks for getting the word out.  Please feel free to send our
response to anyone interested, we learned from others and are happy to help
if we can.

&gt;I was reviewing your &quot;Jova&quot; page, and realized you are running a 1600
&gt;engine. That raises a lot of questions.  If and when you can it'd be
&gt;interesting to have more detailed information about your Westfalia and it's
&gt;mechanical innards, and also what you'd do differently the next time.
&gt;Was your bus built as a non-USA version with the 1600DP as original
&gt;equipment, or was it retro-fitted with the 1600DP so you'd have a simpler
&gt;powerplant for operations in remote regions [a '78 US bus would have a
&gt;hydraulic valve gear 2-liter engine with fuel injection]?
Our van was a California stock 2000 with fuel injection.  We changed the
engine to a 1600 six months before heading out.  Everything is as stock as
possible so we could get parts wherever we are.  So far, just a few
countries in Central America have no VWs.

&gt;Your parts list includes carburetor parts and jets, indicating your 1600 is

&gt;normally aspirated. What adjustments/changes have you had to make to adapt

&gt;to high altitude operation?

I have advanced the timing to get a little more power at altitude.  It has
been somewhat successful, as we have made it to some places where other VW
van owners have not BUT we do not have enough power to make it about 4500
meters.

Some friends have told us about a German mechanic in La Paz, Bolivia (which
is at 6800 meters) who permits car campers to stay at his shop.  His name is
Ernesto Hug and he keeps a log book of visitors which is reportedly filled
with reports from VW owners suffering with the thin air and no power.

&gt;The additional fuel storage is obvious, but where is the extra water

We keep a 25 litre tank at the passengers feet.  It needs to be portable and
have a wide mouth as we generally fill from large 20 liter bottles of
purified water that we purchase from grocery stores.

&gt;You mention bolting stuff underneath the bus. How is this arranged, where
&gt;is it located, and what effect has it had on your ground clearance?
I bolted four spare shock absorbers up under the chassis so it has not
effect on clearance.  I also used expanded metal as a base for a storage
area in the spot under the feet of the passenger.  I decided that this was
not the best idea after passing through a few borders so I removed it and
put the stuff inside.

&gt;what would you do differently

When we changed the motor we did not change the transmission.  I believe
(not sure) that the transmission for a 2000 is geared differently than that
of a 1600.  I also put on bigger tires.  Not to mention the additional
weight.  All of these combine to give less power for taking on hills.  We
have done well but local VWs seem to pass us.  I would do more research on
gearing before setting out.  We met some folks who had a pickup with a
special, low gear.  That would have been nice. Otherwise, things have gone
well.

Once again, thanks for getting the word out about our site.  If you have any
other questions please do not hesitate to write.
