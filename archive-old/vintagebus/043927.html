When a manufacturer/distributor displays a photo of a product and then
sends something else.....close only gets it in handgrenades was my
thinking.  I totally agree with Kevin that they should pick up the
shipping.  ESPECIALLY if it's not made readily apparent in print that
products will be substituted.  Maybe any of us that feel as Kevin does
should e-mail em with our support for his situation and hopefully prevent
others from having to deal with the same problems.  ??????????
later
