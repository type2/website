The problem with trying to find Harry's camper photos is that it's on a
frame driven page and you can't get a direct link to the page.  You have to
go to a page, and then click your way there.

I had one helluva time trying to find them but this should for the rest of
you.

Go to this:  http://thesamba_dot_com/vw/gallery/

Then go down through the list and click on the 9th entry down entitled
&quot;49-67 Bus - Campers&quot;

There you shall see the photos of the mysterious camper.

Hope this helps the rest of you.
