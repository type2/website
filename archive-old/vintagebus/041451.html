A couple of hours ago, at McDonalds in Hallandale picking up some
nutricious fish combos for me and the kids (their choice) I see a couple
eye catching odd folk. The long hair tye dye sort and notice them get into
an early bay westy to partake of their meal. After I got through the
drive thru I went over for a look see and its a somewhat crusty bus
with NC plates and some jesus stickers.  I was wearing a high country
t shirt and I show him his bus on the back and explain the list and all
and give him the web address and had an altogether pleasureable
meeting. Jaime and his wife were from Nags Head. Well see if they find
their way to the list.
Which got me thinking as he wrote down the url that we should have a paper
with a short nlurb and the list info to give to prospective listees I
think Ill make one next week if noone beats me to it.

cheers
