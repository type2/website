Subject: Splitty air scoops

Hey y'all
I've been watching this thread come and go for about 2 years now.  All
this time I had a set on the Tinkertoy.  I removed them 2 weeks ago as
an experiment.  Although I did not measure airflow, engine room
pressures or the like, I trust my oil temperature and pressure gauges.

The scoops DO work as advertised, up to about 55 mph.  The Tinkertoy ran
cooler up to highway speeds.  If the air temperature was less than 80
degrees the oil temp would remain under 120.  Ran real cool in town.
However the dark side of the scoop would reveal it's nature.  Running at
60 mph for 15 minutes, she'd heat up to 180.  Run 65+ for 15 minutes and
she'd hit 210.

Without the scoop I have noticed the following.  She runs warmer in
town.  The oil temp averages about 140.  At speed, oil temp climbs to
180, but stays there even at 65 mph.

If I could devise a variable inlet scoop I'd keep them on.  The end
result is scoops work, but not real well at prolonged highway speeds.
I'll leave them off now for about 2 years and then maybe repeat the
experiment.

BTW it's time for Shamrock Shakes at the scottish restaurant,
MacDonalds!!  The only time of year I'll drink one of their foul
concoctions.  They rock!
