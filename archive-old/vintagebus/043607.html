&gt;&gt;  I had to unscrew that big nut and work over the pipe with carb cleaner
&gt;&gt;  and a piece of wire to get it clear.
&gt;Just a reminder to follow basic safety rules when working on gas tanks,
&gt;particularly if you're doing anything that might even possibly consider
&gt;thinking about generating a spark (like, say, poking a piece of wire
&gt;around inside the tank):

Agreed.  However, at least on a '74 Bug tank, the tube comes off the
tank when you unscrew the big nut.  I was doing the poking safely
away from the tank with just the wire and tube in my hand.

&gt;pour some gravel in the tank and shake it.  Funky music helps.

Note: be careful not to step on your funk.

&gt;get piece of speaker magnet that will fit down the fill spout. sew into
&gt;small bag and sew to a loop you bent in the end of a wire coat hanger.

This is a great idea!  Thanks Clara!
