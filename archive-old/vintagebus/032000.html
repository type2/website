So my  brake lights don't work - I'm a  bit confused becuase my 60 only has

one bulb in the tail lights.  My tail lights work fine.  My license plate

light does not work either ..... hmmmm.  I think my license plate bulb

holder is just too dirty but ... I'm not sure.  Also, my running lights do

not work.  So there is not interrelationship between running lights and

license plate lights right?  Or is there?

I thought taillights and running lights were two phrases for the same thing, 
so I dont understand.

but the lights at each side in the back that come on with te headlights  are 
related to the lisc plate light- think same wire as on Rrear light.

rear blinkies are cconnnected with brake lights in that they use the same 
wire.
I recommend seeing if there is power at the tallights.    use a test light.   
cleaning connections and grounds often helps.    If you crwal unde rthe front 
of the bus and take the test light to the 2 black/red wire at the MC - one is 
hot, and the other goes back to the brake lights.  if you jump them together  
you should have power to the rear/ the brake lights should go on.   If you 
have powr going to, and jumping them makes the brakes work, but stepping the 
pedal doesn't, your sender ccould be the culprit. check out a wiring diagram 
(thoom web page)   It helps to have a helper so one can do the wires and the 
other lok at thelights, or park it where you can see the brakes reflect off a 
white wall or some thing
