Subject: Garage Sale Funny

Had a garage sale today and the DC was parked out front(it's a straight OG 
paint '62) .  A guy comes along and says &quot;hey, wanna sell that beat up old 
VW?&quot;   &quot;Uh...no thanks&quot; I say...&quot;I'll give ya 3 grand.  That's more than its 
worth!&quot; he replies  I paused for a second, and said&quot;Well, I turned down 10K 
so, I think I'll say no&quot;   He says &quot;will you take 12 ?&quot;    I looked back at 
him and say &quot;um, you go from 3 to 12 just like that?? Worthless huh?&quot;    He 
just walked away.  I thought that was kind of funny.

Steve
