Subject: Re: [VB] bias plys?

Did anybody see the Frontline documentary tonight on SUV's and
rollovers?  Near the end they explored (pardon the pun) the Firestone
issue.  Turns out the design of the Explorer had way more to do with the
rollovers than the tires did.  They were defective, but no where near
the extent of the Ford Explorer and its predecessor the Bronco 2!  Why??
 Ford sent a literal army of lobbyist to Washington to influence the
hearings...the result is all the focus was on the tires, not the truck. 
Amazing how the corporations of this country rule all our lives!

No mention of our beloved high center of gravity busses though.  Wade,
do you know who makes a comparable (to what you have) bias ply mud and
snow tire??

  When I
&gt; emailed Firestone about them last year requesting more info, they said
&gt; take them off NOW!!  I suppose they were imagining another F*ord
&gt; Explorer disaster..
