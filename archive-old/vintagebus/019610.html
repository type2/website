(Brian's two cents worth ;-)

Not a nice person...

I have been working now for the last 2 1/2 years to
&quot;recycle&quot; an old clunker as puts it.   In doing so I
have kept up my end in making this as fuel efficient
and non-polluting as I can.  This incudes the
installation of fuel injection (Miller CIS) and making
sure that leaks are dealt with and kept to as close to
zero as possible.  

I just did my first official mileage check and
averaged 20.7 MPG over to Bend (North Santiam pass
included).  This means that I get better mileage than
the Ford Expedition, Excursion, Lincoln Navigator,
Chevy Tahoe &amp; Suburban, Toyota Land Cruiser, Lexus and
even my friends 1999 Ford Explorer.  

Now I have put several thousand dollars in drive train
to make this happen.  This said, it is still far
cheaper overall than a new(er) and IMHO I believe that
in 30 years this persons SUV will be yet another toxic
carcas in a bone yard and I will be slowly enjoying
the sceneary in my sixty year old bus (aka social
barometer :-)

Cheers!

&gt; Hi all;
&gt; The attached Letter to the Editor was published in
&gt; my local paper this
&gt; morning. I cannot let this one pass...I have to
&gt; write back. I can think of
&gt; dozens of things to tell this guy, but I thought I
&gt; would share his letter
&gt; with both lists and hopefully get even more facts to
&gt; destroy this guy's
&gt; nonsense.
&gt; Anyone feeling like adding a comment or two to tell
&gt; this guy please reply
&gt; with your comment. I'll edit the whole thing with
&gt; the strongest facts (there
&gt; is a length limit required by the paper) and send a
&gt; reply. I'll need to do
&gt; this within the next two days.
&gt; I recall Jack Maynard had a great piece written
&gt; about this subject some
&gt; years ago.
&gt; Or perhaps we should write individual emails to the
&gt; editor and bombard them
&gt; with replies??
&gt; Thanks for your input.

&gt; &quot;Give SUVs a break
&gt; I find the furor that many anti-SUV Kuddites bring
&gt; up to the most amusing,
&gt; as are the many &quot;facts&quot; that they pull out of the
&gt; air to prove how
&gt; deleterious a sport utility vehicle will be on
&gt; Earth. Well, excuse me for
&gt; living.
&gt; I used to drive an early 1970's Volkswagen van, not
&gt; unlike some of the aging
&gt; relics seen even now around the Willamette Valley.
&gt; I've enjoyed the economy
&gt; of movement, not to mention the acceleration, these
&gt; vehicles employ.
&gt; My point? The SUV I own now has comparable, if not
&gt; better, gas mileage than
&gt; the old clunker had. Even when I gave my VW van the
&gt; best tune up I could
&gt; give it, drove with a tail wind and kept it
&gt; unloaded, its mileage was not
&gt; better than my much reviled current vehicle.
&gt; Only now, I have the option of having my feet warm
&gt; and keeping the
&gt; windshield defrosted on a cold day. I can accelerate
&gt; much better now, thank
&gt; you very much.
&gt; So, for all those blowhards who are constantly
&gt; whining about the evils of
&gt; SUVs, get a life! Get rid of your clunky
&gt; Volkswagens. Put forth an example.&quot;
