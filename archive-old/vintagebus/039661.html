  Well for the first time since I baught my bus back in October it is warm 
enough (high 40's,I live in Alaska!) to finally start tinkering with 
it.Anyway I attempted to get it running.The problem I ran into is the think 
thunks,not a loud knock.it does it while just turning over and at an 
idle,but totally goes away at higher rpms?this kind of boggles me,most 
sounds like this get worse with acceleration not fainter.I ran it for about 
three minutes and felt that was long enough before shutting it down.In the 
time it was running other than the slight thunking it sounded strong,no 
smoke or anything like that.Oh yeh its a 65 deluxe with a 1500 single port.I 
guess now that I have some decent weather ,and a house with a garage coming 
in 5 more weeks I'll stop lurking and become a constant pain in the a_at_? to 
you guys that actually know something!Thanks
   Carl in Alaska
