Like greg said - Jeff didnt set the parking brake and it rolled backwards
into that tree. (the pic is actually taken sideways. the hill was much
steeper, tree almost straight up in real life)
The guy buys it for 8k (helluva deal), wrecks it, and then last i heard he
wanted 8k for the parts to recover his loss? Now hes sayin 20k?????? &quot;smoke
up johnny.&quot;
