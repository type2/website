   They did that on a budget, people's car you know. Porsche used a solid
steel rod to a bell crank on the back of the fan shroud. They had the
engineering, but just chose not to use it on the VW.

ronnie,  a steel cable has worked fine for me

So, Porsche and a bunch of geniuses designed an incredible engine and were
opening the champgne when somebody said &quot;We haven't done anything about how
to make it go zoom zoom, no acelerator.&quot; They thought about it for a second
and said &quot;Let Gunter do it&quot; and they all laughed. Gunter was a
booger-picking son of a vice president in marketing. 

That is my theory on why I found this incredible piece of crap where the gas
pedal pushes a rod that pushes a &quot;L&quot; bracket that looks like it came from a
Home Depot and stretches a thin wire that pulls on the carb and make the
engine go zoom.

I had to completly redesign and rebuild the whole assembly with a strong
piece of welded steel and a 1/4&quot; piece of steel rod.

I have found a few other not-well-too-thought-out engineering items, have
you?
