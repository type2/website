Subject: Re: [VB] high hinge covers and sisal carpet !

    I'll bet Vw. only used them on the front cargo doors so when exiting the
front cab you wouldn't hook yourself on the hinges.. ?!
    Also, if you try to use &quot;front&quot;cargo hinge covers on the back cargo door
hinge ,then the drain holes will be on top.. ?!
    So if Vw. made rear hinge covers the drain holes would be on the
opposite side...?...

                                             woody

                                     &quot;keep on pushin' &quot;

&gt; Yes, that's correct.  Dunno why they did that.  All the ones I've seen
&gt; had them only on the fronts, although you'll have the holes in the back.
&gt; Don't see any reason why you couldn't add a second set back there.
&gt;
&gt; On the two '60 panels I got last year, the one that was built 11/59
&gt; did NOT have the covers, the other one built in 3/60 did.  Being
&gt; a double-door, it had covers on both *forward* doors, but not the
&gt; rearward doors.
