Subject: HELP in Cutting Safety glass ???
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

Hi I am thinking off using later split windshields in
my safari frames...thus keeping correct logos ect.  

Anyways, we know you cannot cut tempered glass but how
about the safety glass...the kind which is 2 pieces
with plastic sandwiched in between. 

Can I cut this myself using a standard glass plate
cutter?  Can I sand the sharp edges a tad to smooth
them afterwards?

Any help is appreciated!
Tds
