For all the years I had my '64 Deluxe, and again while
I had another bus more recently, I wanted to add an 
airline style overhead swivel nozzle, but I never had 
the gumption to cut a perfectly good cover, and even
had a chance to buy a cover for $5, I couldn't cut up
a perfectly good one.  But I really wanted to add
some directional control to that great air flow onto
my head.

I'd love to see/get a cover plate like that.

Jeff  Bussless, but still scheming
