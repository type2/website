Subject: '59 Euro SC...getting started

OK, so I'm SUPPOSED to be working on my wife's '70 bug vert right 
now. But I'm waiting on a guy to get back with me on some fenders, 
and I have to score a piece of sheet metal...wink,wink,wink.

So I snuck some time in on the '59 Euro Single Cab project that's 
been waiting on me. You may or may not remember that I got this 
truck, along with a '58 Single Cab truck, a few years back for really 
cheap. The '58 Single Cab was in much better condition for the most 
part, but the '59 had the semaphores! So I (arguably stupidly) kept 
the '59 and sent the '58 to Ronnie at oldvolks_dot_com (where I've heard 
rumors of it becoming a Ronniewerks Binz).

The '59 SC had been sand blasted by the guy I got it from. Problem 
was that he never primered it. So it already had a small bit of 
surface rust when I got it. Then ad a year or so of sitting in my 
garage in bare metal...well you get the picture. Things don't really 
rust out here all that much, but anything is enough to have to blast 
again.

Since aquiring the '59 SC I've treated myself to a real sandblaster, 
and upgraded my compressor. So today I FINALLY got around to doing 
something about the poor old truck.

I broke out the blaster and took care of the nose, dash, and dogleg 
areas before the sun started getting ready to set. I then got my 
paint gun out and sprayed primer on all the placed I finished 
blasting.

My goal is to keep doing this in free time until I get the whole 
thing covered in primer. Then I'll start the body work. I've got to 
weld in a whole rocker section the Tom Mink kindly sold to me. And 
I've got a lot of body straightening to do to make it presentable. 
Like my '59 Kombi, I don't think it'll ever be any kind of show truck 
or anything. But it will end up looking pretty cool.

If you want to see pictures of the truck when I got it, go here:

I'll try and start documenting the work I do on it like I did with my Kombi.

Thanks for reading!
