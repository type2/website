Subject: re:  [VB] engine troubleshooting help needed

Well,
With the help from quite a few knowledgable people I've gotten closer to
solving my engine problems.
After retorquing the heads and readjusting the valves the engine overall
runs smoother.
The compression now reads approx 120 on all four cylinders.
Unfortunately I'm still having hesitation and black smoke coming from the
exhaust.
The technical manuals I've read give me a few solutions but non have worked.
They all lean towards carb problems (float or jets) or fuel pressure
problems.
I have taken the carb out, disassembled and cleaned, replaced needle valve,
checked float for holes, and replaced accelerator pump diaphragm, and put
back together.
No change.
I swapped fuel pumps to see if that might have been the problem. Measured
pump rod lengths with three others to see if getting the correct (13mm rise)
into the pump. All good. Still might not be getting correct pressure.

Changed out coil and condenser again to see if weak spark might have been
the hesitation problem. No change.

So, my problem is still there. Black smoke and hesitation at higher rpms.
Other than that the engine idles smooth and looks good with all new powder
coated engine tin......haha

Anyways, looks like I'll be driving the bug to Bug-O-Rama tomorrow.
