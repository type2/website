Hi All,

My SO who fully supports my VW hobby just pulled of my Bush/Cheney
sticker (she voted for al-bore) on the chipper that I like to pull
around with the bus... I use it to hack up the weed crop, anyway, I was
wondering what y'all thought about the difference between GL-4 vs good
'ol Chevron oil would be for the trans... which now rides at a side
tilt... I lowered only the right side of the bus since I was sooooo
undecided but that was only after I installed the CE safari on the left
side and used good ol roofin tar to seal up the right (SO doesn't like
the bugs in her teeth).  I had to be real careful due to the chromed og
kamax bolts and all.... hey, ramblin on like this, I forgot the point of
the email... damn I just hate when that happens.



Dave... heading out the door to take my oldest daughter and 7 of her
friends out on a picnic for lunch... in my new bus... yup, my first real
*bus*... story shortly!
