i have the bumper your talking about
it came off a 72 i parted out with AC
it is hidden behind the bumper and have the silver coated flat tongue stick 
out so that is all you see.

if anybody is interested its available, the bumper has a few tweaks (not bad)
but it is pretty heavy.
also the ac parts are available(over head panel , one door panel w/duct,the 
big duct panel,and all other parts.)
im in NJ
