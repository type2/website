Subject: tranny swap

I'm thinking about putting a '65 bus tranny and brakes into
a '58 bus. Looks like everything will work just fine, but
my concerns are:
1. Will the '58 parking brake cables work?
2. Will the motor mounts work? Are poly mounts OK?
3. How about poly springplate bushings?
4. Are there other 'land mines' I should be concerned about?
The tranny has already been set up for 12volt flywheel and
starter, and the RGB's are in fine shape.
Thanks for any information and insight you might have on this
swap...
Happy New Year...
DUCK
