Subject: 61 DC progress and some sheet metal needs and questions.

I am quickly loosing the race to finish my 61 DC
before my first child arrives.  (Sometime in the next
2 weeks)  I was trying to get the DC running as our
new pick-up since we sold my wifes truck to get a
(non-VW) family SUV.  (I though better of using my 65
Micro)

I found some time to work on it this weekend but
realize (OK, i knew this months ago) that i would not
finish in time.  Anyway, i am just making it a daily
driver DC.  Stock but in no way a show truck.  I do
not even plan to paint it.  (I will say that this is
really hard for me to do.  I hate doing things to a
lesser standard then i am used to.)

I need to get in gear and locate a few parts.  Can
anyone out there can help.  These are for a 1961 bus. 
I am looking for solid restorable pieces, not perfect
stuff.

Passenger side front door (lower only)
Rear engine deck-lid

My question is what have you all used for a primer
that will seal out the weather when left as the final
top coat.  I do not plan to paint the DC and only
drive it occationally. 

Thanks
Matthew
