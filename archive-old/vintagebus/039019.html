&gt;I have a 66 Crew cab and was wondering if there is any way to install
&gt;roll down windows versus the stock slide back windows.  I like hanging
&gt;my arm out the window, but with the sliding setup, it is fairly
&gt;uncomfortable to do this

If it's just an arm rest you need, check your FLAPS or JC Whitney - you
should find a plastic armrest that slips into the door at the window level.
I've been meaning to get one of these myself.
