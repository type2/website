&gt;when i stepped on the brake pedal after seeing a couple cars ahead of me
&gt;slowing down for pedestrians in a crosswalk, the pedal was HARDER than usual
&gt;and i didn't slow down (almost time to panic).  i pushed a bit harder and my
&gt;left front wheel locked up pulling me to the left.  thun the wheel like crazy
&gt;to the right to compensate then all of a sudden the right front brake
locks up
&gt;and whips me to the right extreemely hard, all the way into the next lane! 

&gt;can anyone offer an explanation as to what happened and why it isn't
happening
&gt;now?

I vote for replacing the rubber brake hoses...
