Gee, I sorry George, didn't mean to upset you.  We had a some folks on the
T3 list that converted their cars to DOT 5 with no problems. There is a FAQ
on it somewhere in the world, if anyone wants it, pmail me. (dont tell

&gt; First hand experience talking here.  I decided to &quot;upgrade&quot; my BMW
&gt; motorcycle brakes to DOT5.  Worked fine for about a week, then the brakes
&gt; started sticking in the applied position.
