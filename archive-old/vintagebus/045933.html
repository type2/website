Trying to do some production dating.  VW's &quot;Progressive refinements...&quot;  1964 
edition lists both chassis and body numbers for a given production month.  
Which is the one behind the passenger side of the front seat on a single cab? 
 Where is the other one?

 They stamped the body number in the metal behind the pass seat, till about 
chassis # 398 xxx, when they put in the M code tag there instead.   The 
number on the M code tag is the VIN for the earlier M code tags with the 
colour written in, and has the last 7 digits (the frst two are the first two 
of the model code) for the M code tags with the colout code,           in the 
bottom right corner
