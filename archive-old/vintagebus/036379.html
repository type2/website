&gt; The plastic cage is actually a spacer that keeps the metal rollers
spaced
&gt; evenly apart... like 7 rollers or so total. even support is good.
support
&gt; goes downhill when cage rots, and growling goes up.
&gt; The other upper bearing (inboard) must then do all of the support
work for
&gt; that axle section.
&gt; He could probably make it there safely, but he should plan on going
through
&gt; the reduction box and (IMHO) replacing all of the bearings upon
arrival.
&gt; I don't think it will seize... the actual pressures and resistances
between
&gt; the redux gears will tend to push the axles away from eachother... if
I'm
&gt; thinking correctly on that one.
&gt; The growling is indicative of unevenly spaced rollers and improper
&gt; clearances or alignment of the gears.... something like that. Be
advised
&gt; that this accelerates wear on the gears.
&gt; So, take it easy when driving...
&gt; Diana Kreb's '66 Westfalia lost a chunk or two of the plastic spacer
when I
&gt; changed out the redux box oil... but there was no time to tear all
that
&gt; apart and fix it right at the time. I told her in so many words that
it was
&gt; not a good thing, but that I felt confident that she would make it
back. She
&gt; did make it back to Vancouver from here (_at_ 4,000 miles?).
&gt; 
&gt; Jason Black
&gt; vwbus_at_earthlink_dot_net
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;rich started loosing gear oil out of his reduction box
&gt; &gt;upon inspection they noticed that the plastic cage around
&gt; &gt;the outer bearing is melted
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;1. would it be safe to drive on this say 400 miles till they reach
redding?
&gt; &gt;at wolfgangs
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;they say there is no excessive play on the axle, but i was concerned
 that
&gt; &gt;it might seize and cause some major damage, any thoughts?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;2. is there anybody in or near fresno that might be able to
&gt; &gt;help them, they are in a town called kingsberry (or something like
that)
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;or somewhere in route that they may nurse it to get help
&gt;
