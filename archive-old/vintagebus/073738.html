Subject: The ups and downs...

I would cut your losses and find someone else even for the motor work.
Maybe try and get them to give you the new case they owe you but do you
really want them putting another engine together for you? I went through
this same experience with a guy who built me a tranny in Portland OR
except he actually threatened to sue me if I told anybody about it.
Anyway I walked away from the $800 he stole from me and went to someone
with great references. I had given him one chance to fix his mess and
the tranny locked up on the freeway. I had my whole family in my double
cab in the middle of traffic. Anyway the point is they didn't do too
good of work to start with. Now that you are mad at each other do you
really think they are going to start doing exceptional work now?

Good luck,
Craig
