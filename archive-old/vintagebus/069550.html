Subject: [VB] Dealer Microfiche machine value?


Anyone ever seen those old dealer microfiche machines for sale? A guy i know
from work bought one
from a storage locker auction, which as usuall he prolly paid 20 bucks for
or somethin for the whole
locker. he offered it up to me. He knows nothing about VW's, but tells me
the fiche goes back to the
40s? I dunno bout that, well see. He says it also has a bunch of newer
stuff, scirocco, etc stuff.
What should i offer him for this? I looked in the archives and found a
reference of 50 bucks for the
machine itself from 2 years ago.

Thanks for any input
-Wade
