Subject: Re: [VB] M/C on '67


&gt;As for rebuilt MCs, FWIW some have opined in the past that a rebuilt MC
&gt;can lose some of its stopping power and/or safety once the barrel is
&gt;honed, and should be avoided if possible.  But I imagine that lots have
&gt;done it without a problem, as well.


this is pretty common over on the ol ch*vy truck list... a good way for
stockers or resto geeks to keep the original single circuit brake. keep in
mind that these trucks are s l o w (ours is 52 years old, original babbitt
216, stump puller trans) and a slight reduction in brake power might not
matter.

the clowns who rod out to v8 350+ and KEEP a s/c brake are nuts.

i have a nos m/c for the 65, but i plan on converting to a dual circuit asap.
