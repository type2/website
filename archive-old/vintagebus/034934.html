Hi Ken,
Sounds like you should try to start it a couple of more times.  If you get it 
running see if after running it for an hour if the compression has come up in 
all the cylinders.  If so the ring hopefully will be loosening up.  If not 
remove the heads and cylinders and loosen them by hand.
   This is the big reason why before storing a used engine it really helps to 
squirt some oil into the spark plug holes and change the engine case oil to 
help prevent this kind of proplems due to corrosion!   Eric&amp;Barb
