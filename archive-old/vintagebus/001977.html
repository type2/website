Erin,

Don't stop the ads site. I really like it.  When dealing with people from
many different back grounds all over this country, we need to cut a little
latitude. I think you will find that people from small mid west towns tend
to be driven to contribute in someway to the society they live in. for
example; volunteer fire depts.  Often if a farmer is sick all the neighbors
and even people from all over the county will come and harvest his crops for
him. Don't confuse Erin's eagerness to contribute as show boating.  He is
sincere.

Thanks,

Kevin Sullivan
