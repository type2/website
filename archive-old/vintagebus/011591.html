&gt; You're planning a huge trip in 100 degree weather. Would you rely on
Muir's 
&gt; rap on oil and stick with straight weight heavy duty oil, or
acknowledge that 
&gt; we've come along way since then and multiweight oil provides more
protection?

The problem with huge trips is that they take you to places with a
wide range of temperatures.  One of our trips took us from Death
Valley (115F) to Glacier National Park (20F).

I've always used 20W50 oil in the summer.  That way I'm covered at
both extremes and not tempted to press on with the wrong oil in the
engine.

If I take a trip to the cold country in winter, I switch to 10W40, but
still use the same oil for the entire trip.

Muir might have been correct, but his information is about 20 years
out of date.  Current multi-weight oils work fine.  I'd be more leery
of single-grade oil, as they aren't used all that much by the
manufacturers and therefore have had less improvement effort done on
them.
