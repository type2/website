&gt; &gt; But how can you have your bus up for auction on two websites? What if

&gt; 
&gt; Easy. I had the reserve set at $5000 on the vintage bus auction. I had a few
&gt; local folks interested, but I didn't want to waste any time getting it up
&gt; either. I knew it would never get that high, so I wasn't committed to
&gt; selling it if it sold through other channels. After the locals fell through,
&gt; I decided to throw it on ebay as well. Besides, with all the deadbeat
&gt; bidders out there, I'd be lucky if either one of the high bidders came
&gt; through. And I'm half right already  :-)

Umm, how can you complain about &quot;deadbeat&quot; bidders when you intentionally
run an auction in which you don't intend to sell the goods unless someone 
bids a ridiculously high amount?  Isn't that being a &quot;deadbeat seller&quot;?

To me, this seems to be a competition for the moral low ground with your
Georgia friend!  :)
