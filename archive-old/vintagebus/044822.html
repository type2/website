Subject: RE: Truck rear View Mirror
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

Hi UJ,
Just install the two exterior mirrors.  With a load in the back or a tilt on 
top the interior mirror is usless.  Even with the back window unobstructed 
all it will show you is that you have a telephone pole directly behind you.  
With the rear gate up anthing below 4' will be out of sight.  The only good 
use of the interior mirror is to sight out the backside of the passenger door 
window to help reduce the huge blind area the driver has on that side.  Which 
could be easily helped with a convex mirror mounted to the fresh air access 
panel.    Eric&amp;Barb
