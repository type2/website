Subject: Re: [VB] Third brakelight?

&gt;I have got this engine hatch without the third brakelight housing but with
&gt;the cutout. I was looking for a housing and ran across one for an ambulance
&gt;that looks like it would work, but am not sure, any suggestions?
&gt;
Ambulances had reverse lights.  Depending on the year, I believe they are
the same except that they only have one bulb.  Make sure it has 4 holes to
mount the housing.

The normal center brakelight housing has both a brake light holder and a
license light bulb holder.
