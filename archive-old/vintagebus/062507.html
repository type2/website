&gt; From Lind Bjornsen's tragic bus trip story:
&gt; 
&gt; &quot;...the postmortem analysis of the wreck showed that the rear left wheel came
&gt; off of the vehicle.  I believe that this was due to the powdercoating
&gt; on the wheels caused the lug bolt to lose torque some 4000 miles after the
&gt; wheels lug bolts had been properly torqued on.   when the wheel
&gt; came off, the bus pulled to the left.
&gt; 
&gt; Check that torque!
&gt; 
&gt;Holy shit!  I was just hanging w/ those guys the nite before OCTO talking bus
trash. Lind offered to bring any &quot;goodies&quot; I found at the swap home to Boise
for me as I wasn't traveling by bus. Thank god they're ok.

On the other hand, I've got thousands of miles on powdercoated rims w/o
problemos.  WTF?

How do I reach him other than his phone?
