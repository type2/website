Subject: Needed Heater part 

List, I am wanting to put a BA6 in my 66 since with the new type 4 motor
I have, it no longer has a stock heater system. 
The piece I need most for the BA6 setup is a timer/thermostat dash
switch, though I would also like to get a better safety switch as mine
looks pretty crusty. I have all the other parts already (I think). 
Does anyone have such parts they want to sell me? I would also take a
complete bench tested and rebuilt unit if someone has one of those to
pawn off.
Additionally I have two other heaters that I could use as trading stock
if someone wanted them. 
The fist one is a near NOS Stewart Warner Under the dash heater that I
had installed in my old DD camper last year. It runs perfectly and has
probably less than 100 hrs on it over a 3 month time frame. This unit
was a NOS unit that I sent to a guy in Colorado to bench test and
adjust.
The second unit is a BN-4 out of a 72 bus that for a short period I had
installed under the rear seat of an old crewcab. This unit is extremely
clean and works perfectly as well.  It had been fired up once every
couple of weeks last season to help heat my workshop bench. I have since
installed a large ceiling mounted heater in the shop and plugged the
exhaust port hole in the wall, so this unit is no longer being used as
well.
Any and all help is appreciated
