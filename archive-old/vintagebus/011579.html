&gt;--JOSH: I am convinced this is an American conversion. The sink says
Campmobile but it doesn't match the rest of the bus.
**(It is probably a Westy sink as I first guessed)**

 It's a converted
panel, crank-out windows w/separate individual gutters. Westyish coat
cabinet with a mirror on the door.
**(Mirror on inside or outside?)**

 Woodwork is not Baltic birch, appears to
be 1/8&quot; ash ply.
**(Like paneling or laminant?)**

 Cab interior is painted white but aft is grey primer where
paint is exposed.
**(Typical for Panel van)**

 Z-bed. Conversion upholstery is in a ghastly embossed red
vinyl, you have to see it to believe it. Overall the cheese factor is
around 8.5, it is not low. 8)
**(I am definitely drawing a blank on the red,  I am starting to think you
have
a real Heinz 57 here.)**

 Attached step does not fit into the jack
points, it is affixed with bolts and is permanent. There are two whatsits
on the roof that seem to have had something to do with an awning, no longer
extant.
**(Not standard with any camper tha I have seen,yet)**

 No evidence of drilling to accomodate a child's cot but conspicuous
room (not occupied) on top of the coat cabinet.
**(maybe for awning)**

 There is some evidence that
there was a ladder on the pass side.
**(I have seen  a few on  American conversions.)**
&lt;
Awaiting pictures and looking forward to breaking up more of the American
camper conversion mysteries!
