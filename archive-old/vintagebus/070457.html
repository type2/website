This might be a stupid question, but who in their right mind would assemble a
motor dry? Worse case for me is motor oil, then start up right away and
install. Second method is assembly lube if I plan on putting the short block
on the shelf for awhile. Seems like an awfully expensive way to tear up a set
of bearings. Why don't you just hit them with some 120 grit sand paper before
installing them? Hmmm

&gt; If you are turning it over with the starter motor, recommended procedure,
and
&gt; you haven't seen oil pressure at the sensor within 15-20 seconds, something
is
&gt; really wrong.

Tidbit....
If assembled dry the oil pump can fail to prime itself.
Solution is to prime it by squirting oil in the sender hole
(and maybe turning backward and squirting more).
