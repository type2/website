I agree entirely with Fred's comments. I think the knowledge base that the
&quot;sermons&quot; represent will be sorely missed by myself and a great many others.
The ones who are thankful when they find an answer to a problem at 2:00 AM
that will allow them to drive to work the next morning. Perhaps we have all
just taken this wealth of knowledge and helpful spirit for granted, never
saying &quot;thanks for the work, time and effort&quot;. I have personal knowledge of
the true character of Bob Hoover and would like to offer a public THANK YOU
for all you have given so freely.
