Jim,
    Congrats.  I have a daughter ( now 22) and am forever greatful for her
and the times we shared while she was growing up.  Now, go buy a couple of
shotguns and a few spools of barbed wire and you'll be ready when she starts
to date.

&gt; Paula and I are very happy to announce the birth of
&gt; our first child (daughter). Major miracle as both Mom
&gt; and Dad were told that we'd never have children.
&gt;
&gt; Audrey Leigh Ellis
&gt; Born 01/05/00
&gt; 17:02 pm
&gt; 4lbs 13oz _at_ 34 weeks.
&gt; As good looking as her mother! =)!
&gt; Came just past 5pm, 5th of Jan at 17:02 1+7+2 is
&gt; divisible by 5
&gt; Did the proper break-in thing. No idling at birth.
&gt; Kept her screaming for 10 minutes _at_ 3000 rpm. Then
&gt; dropped all fluids. Will keep it in town until 500
&gt; mile retorque.
&gt;
&gt; Went into phase two at 4:20 PM hahahahaha!
&gt;
&gt; All fingers and toes accounted for. Quickly got over
&gt; that momentary &quot;California Raisin&quot; purple thing. DOH!
&gt; If you been there then you know what I mean.
&gt; Mom, Dad and baby are healthy, tired and happy.
&gt; Came a little early and was a little small, but turned
&gt; out just fine. Thanks for the prayers and support. Mom
&gt; and baby due home probably Thurs PM.  Somehow we beat
&gt; the odds. Must have been the rocking campout a month
&gt; prior to the VW Classic trip. Our private laugh is
&gt; that she will ride home in the '54 Ambulance. It's the
&gt; only vehicle that we have with seat belts in the rear
&gt; at the moment. &lt;Serious&gt;! Poor kid has old hippy
&gt; parents.
&gt; -Jim and Paula
