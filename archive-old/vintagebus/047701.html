Let me try to enlighten you older people, well older people should know more 
about this then the the youth. Primer is a look and a state of mind, its a 
style, look fifties american customs. I would rather drive original paint on 
a bus, but if I couldn't, I would rather drive primer than an incorrect paint 
color.

 Regarding the wheel well scraping, a friend of mine had an 
 epsiode where the bus hit a dip _at_ freeway speeds, and one of the front
 wheels hit the top of the wheel well and locked momentarily,
 pitching the bus.  He swore off lowered buses after that.
 
 I get a kick out of watching all of the local kids with their
 slammed buses and bugs, bobbling down the road.  That can't
 be comfy - I know the lowered cars I had weren't and they were not
 that low!
 
 What makes it even more funny is knowing they spent several hundred
 dollars on lowering goodies, and then low-profile tires, and a killer stereo,
 on a bus they've rattle-canned in gray primer from top to bottom.  Rarely 
 do the cars progress beyond this stage.  What they've spent on 
 back-of-the-magazine-cool stuff would have bought them a 
 low-end paint job.  I know of one cal-look bug that's been in primer
 going on 10 years.
 
 Ah, youth. &gt;&gt;
