My 57 left the factory with sand green bumper brackets. The splash pans were 
painted semi-gloss black and the tops were sprayed sand green to match the 
body.
They probably switched this at 58 when they stopped painting the bumpers the 
same color as the body, correct?
Were the early ones different from the later ones?

&lt;&lt; A friend of mine , who is a vintage nazi,needs to know the color that the 
bumper brackets and splash pans (for rear bumper) came from the factory. &gt;&gt;
Hi Woody,
Definitely black.  A semi-gloss would be a good idea, and probably correct!
