Subject: Re: [VB] Pop out window frames

Gary,

A bit late here, but I rejected powder coating for the window frames,
because if it chips, rust gets in, and you don't see it til it's really
too late. Regular paint and primer, properly done, with or without POR-15
assist, is far better. Get into ALL the creases and cracks!

Let us know how it works out!

&gt; Howdy,

&gt; I am replacing my rusted beyond repair pop out window frames on my '66
&gt; Deluxe with new units from Wolfgang.  Since they are bare metal, has anyone
&gt; powder coated these before installing seals and glass, or should they just
&gt; be painted the old fashioned way?  Thanks for any and all advice.
