Subject: Re: [VB] stock restos are easy...My bus, my reply

Pity the true automotive artiste!  He has restored so many buses that
the thrill, the challenge is no longer there!  His creative spirit cries
out for something more fulfulling!  Then one day he discovers...
metal-flake purple paint!  (And the angels sing....)     B^)

My opinion (and everybody has one, don't they?) is that customizing cars
is like customizing houses.  Looks great for a few years, then one day
you have to sell it and you realize that the market for your idea of
good taste is limited!
