boxes. one book that i have says that .5 pints is all it needs .that dosent 
sound like much.

hi Nick, when I change tranny oil, I drain the center section first, then  
the sides, and re plug the center and fill the sides first.     It is not 
much oil to fill the RGBox, I fill till I can see it bubble through the axle 
tube.   If you leave the drain plug out of the center you can tell exactly 
how much as it will dripp  out the center when the side is full.  (no- dont 
do that its a mess).  Warm the oil up first unless you want to build up those 
arm muscles.
