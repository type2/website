Shawn ponders:
Hey all, I have a 67 kenzile clock that I am servicing before installing
it. After going through the back end and cleaning the points so it will
run, I am now going to clean it up cosmetically. So far I have taken the
bezel off, the lens and the inner collar from the front side of the
unit. I figured the minute hand and the hour hand would just easily pull
off but they don't seem to. I am afraid of pulling to hard on it and
breaking it. What I am wanting to know is this the way you take them
off? If anyone could shed some light on this I would greatly appreciate
it.
