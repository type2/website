Hello,

A VW person i trust advocates the following procedure, and i plan to use
it on my doglegs etc. when i get the time... and get em sealed up and
repaired etc.

Fill the area with Rust-Oleum Rusty Metal Primer.

What i was told to do was buy a gallon or so, thin it 1:1 (2 thinner :1
paint if yer broke) and plug the drain holes and fill the cavity, then
drain the paint out into a bucket and re-use it in the next rocker or
dogleg etc.

I am unsure exactly how much paint this might take, but the expert who
told me about this is someone whose opinion i trust.

take care,

Steve
