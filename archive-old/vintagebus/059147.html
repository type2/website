Hey Jon,
I just look at it from the point of view that in brakes, redundancy is a
very good thing.  You won't find a single circuit system being sold today.
Yeah, running quality parts is a good
thing.  You won't find a Varga part on any of my single circuit systems
believe me.  I probably would run German stuff on it even if dual circuit,
you know me.  If it costs more it must be better.:)  Probably time to
bleed some brakes, you are right.  Been about 2 years.  I plan on
converting my 62 to dual circuit just to see how it does.  It won't change
the pucker power of driving a loaded pre-64 bus and having to jam on the
brakes and hoping you were following far enough behind, but it will give
me some peace of mind that I can get it off the road under some control if
a wheel cylinder blows.
