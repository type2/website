Hi,

If DaveE hauls it  up to EveryBus on Friday the will be lots of oppurtunity
to send the package( It was a package when it last rolled through Greensboro
several months ago and by now it should need a hand truck just to  move it
from bus to bus) West or even to THE GREAT WHITE NORTH:) Ted could bring it
back to Ohio or Jamie could turn this into an international incident.

We have to be careful though. DaveJ will be at E-bus and he might wanna
polish the hubcap again if he is not too busy convincing the rangers that
burning a case would be fun for everyone :)

See ya Friday at E-bus!
