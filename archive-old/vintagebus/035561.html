Hi Patrick,
1964-71 brakes are the same front and rear.  Pretty sure the rears are the 
same up to 1979.  Just make sure to not only get the levers on the rear 
shoes, but the cross rods also in there.  Worse comes to worse remove the 
drums making sure they have 46mm nuts which are late model indication rather 
than the earlier 36mm ones.  Then disconnect the E-brake cables and remove 
the bearing cover four bolts per side , and just pull out the brake backing 
plate with all the brake parts still mounted on them.  Eric&amp;Barb
