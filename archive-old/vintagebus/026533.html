Subject: [VB] Engine health &amp; RGB fix
Message-ID: &lt;385D466A.4D941A43_at_earthlink_dot_net&gt;

Finally got out and fixed the rusted rgb plugs today.  A bit stubborn,
especially the right one, but some heat and a homemade seal puller
seemed to do the trick.  I used the plugs from WW.  VERY expensive, but
they are close by and I needed to get stupid things to stop leaking.
Good quality metal plugs.

I also need some input on the health of my motor.  1600 sp, dog house,
stock.  Compression is 120 in 1 &amp; 2, and about 110 in 3 &amp; 4.  It runs
great, with the exception of some oil leaking at high speed from the
crank pulley.

What is the acceptable limit for compression?  When should I think about
shelving the motor?

Thanks!

Steve
