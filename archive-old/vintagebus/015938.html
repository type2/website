Subject: Leaking Windows: Safaris

We had a nice rain yesterday.  Yes, the CE safaris leak, but
not as bad as the Wolfgang ones did.  One thing that I know would make
them less-leaky would be a stronger outside dash tab.  The inners are
twice as thick as the outers, and hold the window against the seal
better.  The outers are too thin, and that fact, coupled with the
mechanical advantage of the window latch against the longer tab, 
doesn't exert enough pull against the seal.

Since i figured they were going to leak, when I prepped the dash tray for
paint, I drilled 1/8&quot; holes in each of the pressed &quot;comparments&quot; at
what I calculated was the low spot.  So even if the windows leak, the water
doesn't end up standing in the tray.   The water ends up on the floor mat.

Drilling before painting is a nicer solution, but you could do it after the 
fact if you touched up the holes.
