Hello list,

I know this isn't strictly vintage bus, but does anyone know how to tell  if an engine has the mounting holes for a 68-71 bus rear hanger without actually looking at the motor?  I have a lead on a motor but the guy is not sure if it's a bus block.  He did say it used to be in a fastback and that it is a 1974(year) motor.
Can someone crosspost this to the bay window list?
