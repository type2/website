I feel sort of dumb posting this message after i was just bragging up my bus 
but I NEED a New turn sig switch for my 65.  My switch has  not been quite 
right for the year that i have owned my bus.  but now the Bakelite? part of 
the switch that connects the contacts is busted.  I have enough problems 
with the  #$%^&amp; cops with out giving them a legit reason to mess with me.

The only switch i could find from a retailer is $200.00!!  So I was 
wondering if any of you could help me out with a less expensive one.  I 
really want to drive my bus!!!

Many TIA,  If you can help me call 517 283 2756 and ask for ron or domonic, 
or email me
