Subject: Re: [VB] Engine Oil &amp; Cooling

&quot;In small engine repair it states 1/3 heat is conducted through cylinder
walls, 1/3 for power 
in the cylinder, 1/3 escapes in exhaust.&quot;
------------------ Clip -----------------------
Small engine has nothing to do with VW Air Cooled.
Take a quick look at VW oil pans, built for cooling oil.
Cylinder fins, for cooling.
Fan on engine for cooling.
The simple addition of an RX7 oil cooler will bring your oil temp down by
30 degrees in 100 degree heat running 3000 rpms.
Oil plays a major role in cooling the VW Air Cooled.
High oil temperatures break down the engine oil, thin out the engine oil,
oil pressures drop.
If you can get your engine oil running about 200 / 220 degrees your
engine will last a long time.
