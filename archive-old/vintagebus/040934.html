&gt; I sent the following reply to The Bus Depot:
&gt;.
&gt; you got a excuse for everthing dont you ?
&gt; It doesn't matter any how, I am done with you,
&gt; thanks for wasting my time
&gt;
&gt; what a business man to respond with the following appology
&gt;&gt; Well, the feeling's mutual.

&gt; thanks ron you are quite a gentleman
&gt; this has gone to far, isn't the customer always right?



No.  Sometimes the customer is a jerk.  Anyone who has dealt with the public
for any length of time will attest to that.

Okay, sometimes the small business owner is a jerk too.  We are all human
and tend to respond similarly to the way that we are treated.  If you want
to receive a &quot;gentlemanly&quot; response, then it's best to treat the person
you're dealing with in kind. I don't care if I'm a businessman, I'm also a
person, and damn it, if I get treated like sh*t, I'm just not inclined to
respond in a &quot;gentlemanly&quot; way. To be honest, I'm just as glad to be rid of
this guy as he is. I got absolutely trashed on this list for the minor error
of a seal being excluded in an order, even though the correct one was sent
out literally within hours of when he let me know it was missing.  When I
responded with an apology and an offer to make things right (if I only could
figure out what I still was supposed to do, given that I'd already sent him
the missing seal), I got trashed again.  And I got accused of essentially
being a crook and G-d knows what else.  The attacks rapidly moved from
factual to insulting, personal, and in most cases, groundless.  By then, I
just wasn't feeling very &quot;gentlemanly.&quot;


Sometimes I royally screw up an order.  Maybe in this particular case I
didn't deserve to be trashed like I was, but I that doesn't mean that there
haven't been a few cases where I did deserve it.  I'll be the first to admit
that I'm human and can scew up as good as anybody.  If I screw up on your
order, please tell me. I'm an honest guy and have been around a long time.
If I know about the situation I really will do what I can to make it right.
And bear in mind, of course, that I ship dozens of orders to splitty
owners/listmembers every day that are precisely as promised. Just because a
person (or two) vocally complained on the list doesn't make them the norm.
It is human nature that people are much more likely to complain when
something goes wrong, then compliment when something goes right.  Since I
ship a lot of orders, I will of course make a higher number of mistakes than
someone who ships fewer orders, just by the law of averages.  (If I never
shipped one order, my error rate would be zero percent.)

Look, I'm just a bus owner trying to supply the bus market with parts as
best I know how.  I started this business as a hobby, and it turned into
more, much to my surprise. I have been on the List since before I even owned
The Bus Depot, back when the Vanagon, Type2, and VintageBus lists were still
one combined List, and I was working a 9-5 job and working on my buses on
the weekend. My goal is very simple when it comes to The Bus Depot: The
cheapest possible prices on Quality parts.  I was a Buyer before I started
the Depot, and my expertise was in finding bargains.  I think that a
comparison will bear out the fact that I do that better than anyone.  But
that's all I promise. I don't claim to be the world's leading expert on
splitties. There are plenty of members on this list who know more about
splitties than I do. (And part of the reason I'm on this list is to learn
from them. I have a '63 deluxe myself, but admittedly it's my only splitty,
whereas I've owned many bay-windows and Vanagons. I've taken apart a Type 4
engine before but - gasp!- never a Type 1 engine.)  Neither do I claim to
offer the ultimate in customer service, although I do my best to be more
than fair.  You don't get Macy's service at Sams Club prices, but if you're
realistic, you don't expect it either. Nor do I promise rapid delivery,
unless you specifically ask for express delivery (which I can then provide).
I promise good prices on good parts. Period.

So if you're a price-shopper, I'm your man. But if you are looking for a
higher-priced/higher-service supplier, then I'm probably not your man.
There are other vendors who can provide you with more advice and faster
service (at generally higher prices, of course). It's your wallet, your bus,
and ultimately your choice.  Regardless, I have the right to be treated with
the same decency and respect as anyone else on this list. Those who like to
think that &quot;the customer is always right&quot; should also remember that a
business is not an inanimate object, but is made up of real, flesh-and-blood
people, who deserve to be treated as such.

My long-winded $.02, with which I will, from my end, close the subject...
