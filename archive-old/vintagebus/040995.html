&gt;What are the tricks? This could be a handy thing for 12v and 6V owners to
&gt;know.

&gt;Chris

I was afraid someone would ask that...and I can't provide *proper* details. 

The best bottom-line solution that I heard of was a setup that calls for the installation of a second 6-volt battery. The second is attached with ???an isolator??? to the primary, engine-powering battery. The generator is switched, I think...and I'm not sure, but you may need a very specialized generator for this? 
Maybe even a different or a second voltage regulator? Obviously I'm a little confused about electrical engineering this system.

The result is two sets of power sources: one 6-volt to run the engine, wipers, and whatever else you leave 6-volt; the second line is 12-volt, and allows you to install a 12-volt radio, if you like...or change your lights to 12-volt, or whatever...you do the wiring.

But this setup, as I understand it, gives you a net of 13+ volts, into which you can attach a jumper cable from a 12-volt car. It also gives you a second 6-volt source, in case the first goes down. I *imagine* that it could be designed so that you could even temporarily run 12-volts into your starter for those -20 degree mornings.

If I were doing the conversion again, I'd seek out the details on this type of setup. I *know* there are people out there who can design this; I'm just not one of them.

I would pursue this with a wiring solution that would result in two sets of fuse panels: one 12-volt; one 6-volt. I very well may do this with my '64 rustoration.

Thanks! Joe
