I'll throw in pretty much with Chip on this one.  I've always had good
responses from Bob.  Some were very enlightening.  People like Bob can often
say something and you think about it and say Yeah, that makes alot of sense,
I never thought about it that way.  Now I have noticed Bob doesn't suffer
fools lightly.  It's been quite a few years since Bob was young and
foolish.:)  We all have at one time been young and foolish hopefully.  It's
only normal.  Bob has a problem most of us don't have to deal with.  We
don't get personal e-mails from every new person all over the world asking
goofey questions that even a novice mechanic would understand.  Alot of
folks buy a VW and have no concept of mechanical things.  It's not their
fault on one hand, on the other Bob's patience probably ran out a long time
ago and I wouldn't presume to begrudge him that.  Probably alot of people
are a little intimidated to post publicly with what they feel is maybe a
stupid question and they go to Bob.
Naturally if people took a little more time as Chip said, many times the
answer would be right there.  Still there should be no apology about posting
to the list.
There are alot of growing resources available to us here that alot of
talanted people have put together for the very purpose of finding the answer
quickly without having to bother anyone.  I have found a great deal of
information in the Hoover Sermons I find to be excellent.  There is also
other information on this and other websites that is excellent.  Josh has
put up some good new stuff.
Bob has his ways, be tolerant even if he isn't.  He's done his share in
things more than just the VW thing I think.  All of us are a little
different from the others.  Only thing that keeps this thing going is VWs.
They are kind of fun, but they're just a car so don't take it too serious.
I'm getting tired of everybody taking the little stuff too serious.

John
