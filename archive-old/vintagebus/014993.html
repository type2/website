Subject: Update on my '64 panel

Hope the site link works now. Sorry for that mistake. I got the numbers
off the body from engine compartment and these numbers don't match the
title. Numbers on the plate on the overhead unit match the numbers on the
body. That number is: 1276786
Anybody recognize this number???? I mean there might be someone there
that had this bus before or someone that is missing this bus and has
title for it. I might have to go and register this bus from scratch using
a story about lost title. The problem is this: what if this bus has been
stolen???? Any feedback on this?
Thanks volks :-)
