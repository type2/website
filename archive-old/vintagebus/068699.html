&gt; This LIST has come through AGAIN in offering help to a bus

It's a funny thing....this list.

I have been on this damn thing for about 5 years now...and sometimes I still feel like one of the newbies.

Over those 5 years I have become quite fond of the 'list' and it's 'listees'.  Many friends and acquaintances have been made through the workings of this list.  Ricky Fu is one of them.  Ricky's family and mine have become quite close over the past year, mostly in the past few months. I met him through the list, and we met up at the BYOB show last year.  We find it quite amusing with the similarities between the two of us...
Both Asian (how many Asian guys do you see driving splitties?), both have white Anglo wives, both drive Pearl White campers, and on and on.  From the get go, we hit it off.

Along with Ricky, there a few others I've met along the way--all of whom I would have never met w/o this list.
I wouldn't have my EZ if it weren't for VanBondo and this list.  Chuck Notmeyer and I began talking because of a toy I sold him.  Ronnie, VWHoward..along with many more...

I know many others have the same type of stories.  There are campouts where you might see these people once a year, but when you see them it's like seeing an old friend you've known all of your life.

It's really good to hear the stories and reports of listees on the road getting helped out, or meeting up along their trips.  I'm glad to have helped out a few guys on the road or at a show.  I know they'll be there for me when my time comes -at least I hope they will =)

For you new guys just joining us.....stick around and enjoy the ride.  I'll see ya at a campout sometime...

A big thank you to VWHoward for telling me about this list 5 years ago...when I bought a 62 Singlecab from him...what a POS =)

I feel so sentimental now....I think I'll go cry in my beer &lt;sniff...tito, get me some tissue&gt;

Come to think of it...this list has been playing quite nice lately...must be time to stir up some sh#t ...muahhhahahaha
