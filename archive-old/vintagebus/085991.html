I can't  remember if you had an answer to this yet or not, but this
number is  somewhat consistent with a 1965 Bug engine, produced some time
in the  second half of 1964.


Hi Matt,
Correct according to our 1970s VW Beetle parts manual.  Additionally  that 
engine number could have been transferred to a new bigger badder later new  VW 
engine, due to some states legal system.  Some of these states  required the 
same engine number in the VW as when brand new or the VW was  considered stolen, 
and some even used the engine number instead of body  number for ID purposes.
  Even if it is an original 1200cc Beetle engine case it could have  been 
bored for bigger 1300, 1500, &amp; 1600 P&amp;Cs.
  Jon can you get up an image of the intake manifold nearest the spark  
plugs?  The plugged off intake pipe just below the carb looks like a brake  booster 
connection for a later bus.
