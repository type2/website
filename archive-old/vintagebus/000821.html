 Steve,
 
     RMMW lists them as:
     &quot;211 501 249, Plug, Gear Reduction Housing, L or R, '64-'67 type II,
 $4.95 ea....&quot;
     1-800-258-1996 is their #.
     you were looking for *plugs*, but no affiliation whatsoever.... :)
     A reliable source told me before that they were actually called &quot;welch
 plugs&quot;... the dictionary tells me that's a variant of &quot;welsh&quot;... leading me
 to think that the welch plug was thought up by someone from Wales, or has
 something to do with &quot;welching on a deal&quot;... *failing* for a practical
 explanation.... i.e. the plug will fail first before extreme pressure
 grenades your redux box or w*sserboxer block or what-have-you.
     something like that...
     If Providence has smiled upon you, the plug will have rusted from the
 outside in instead of the other way around... take a decent look at the
 metal you'll see upon removing the old plugs.
     Some of the hard chrome varieties of piston rings are coated with iron
 oxide to help them break in. The stuff is abrasive, and none too good for
 the bearings in your redux box...
 
 later....

historically, the Welsh have sometimes decided that promises made to enemies 
are non binding.  Thus, the irked enemies, when the welsh have run back up 
the mountains and laughed, considered the whole lot a bunch of liars.  

it's been said that
The Welsh pray on their knees..and prey on their neighbors
The Scots keep the Sabbath, and anything else they can get their hands on.
The Irish aren't sure what they want, but are willing to fight for it anyway.
And the English consider themselves an selfmade nation, thereby relieving the 
Almighty of a great responsibility.

so humour aside, it's nice to know where you can get the plugs for the 
RGBoxes.


Anyway, I went to the Mall the other day- eekk, tried to get some boots but I 
can't everget it together.  the point is there was this dayglo green with 
seventies hippy flowers all over it fake bus (baywindow though) set up with 
some shop selling jewelrey or something out of it.  hm.

Also, the front right brake cylinders in the wheel started leaking on my 65 
westy.  I took the brakes aprt the other day cause the braking power had 
become less than adequate, and that is what I found.   They were the Varga 
brasilian wheel cylinders. I replaced them all  - front and back- new about 3 
1/2 years ago.  hm

still got a wierd squeak in the front somewhere.   feel like it's coming from 
the left front wheel somewhere.   I have been greasing the suspension at 
every tuneup till fresh grease comes out for about a year, instead of the 
yearly greasing.  I regreased it all, asumming that after Octobugfest some 
was squished oiut because of the load carried, it got less, but not gone.   
Fresh grease comes out now.  maybe I should get shocks.  Definately need 
tires.  Think I'm just rambling now.

Funny thing is I got this old POS bus a few years ago, and fixed a bunch of 
stuff up to make it a driver,  but of course there's still stuff to do, rust 
repair, fix camper kit, etc etc, and I am already needing to fix thing I 
fixed years ago, due to wear and tear or whatever.  sigh.

Clara
