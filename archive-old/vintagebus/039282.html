Subject: VW Show San Francisco Area Aug 15th
Date: Wed, 5 Aug 1998 05:29:17 -0700 

Well, here are some of the details from the brochure:
Not actually SF, but close enough for a Subject line.

Saturday August 15, Pleasanton Fairgrounds.
Put on by Goodtimes Motorsports.

Show times 7:00 - 4:00

$10 General admission, $5 kids 7 - 12
$20 VW entry (includes driver)
$30 Show entry (includes driver)
$40 Swap (includes driver)

It's off I880 south of Pleasanton.
Take Bernal Exit East
at stoplight turn left then right into parking lots

The other side of the brochure says that
gates open at 8:00, go figure.
If you want anything more, here's a phone number:
510-417-2004, I called, pretty much clueless.

They have a website:
http://www.goodtimesmotorsports_dot_com/

But it's worthless for any useful information on the show.

Although they mention another show upcoming:
Super VW Sunday, Vallejo Fairgrounds, Oct. 25, 1998

Not associated with them, never been to one of their
shows, just might be able to go, may not, so getting info.  
Have to get my kids to Tahoe the same day.  That'd make 
for some serious one day's driving.
