&lt;&lt;(heated wires gain resistance).&gt;&gt;

This is just the opposite of what I would have suspected. Because with
heated metal, not only is there more stored energy in the bonds, but the
bonds themselves would be freer to release. So I would have thought that
current would flow through the metal much easier when heated. You seem
very knowledgable, and I don't doubt that what you are saying is so. It
is just that I am having a rough time assimilating this fact into the
whole of my limited scientific knowledge.
