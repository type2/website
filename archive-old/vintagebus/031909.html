Subject: RE: Doublecab rear seatbelts
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

Several years ago I did some research on seatbelts that led me to conclude 
that rear seat, lap-only belts were not the way to go.  Statistics gathered 
by the NTSB (and somewhat reluctantly supported by data from the University 
of North Carolina's Highway Safety Research Center) strongly indicated that 
there was a down side to lap-only rear-seat belts.   In collisions at speeds 
below about 50mph, occupants wearing lap-only belts suffered significantly 
greater injuries than unbelted occupants, the primary problem being fractures 
of the pelvis and intestinal ruptures.

At 60mph and above, belted passengers fared somewhat better than unbelted 
ones, tho injuries tended to be severe in all cases.  But older-model 
European cars, such as Volvo and Jaguar, with rear-seat three-point 
lap-shoulder restraints, had far lower rates of deaths and injuries than cars 
with lap-only or no belts.  

I see no reason a 3-point system couldn't be installed in a doublecab, 
perhaps by reinforcing the sheet metal directly behind the rear seat to add 
mounting points.  Personally, I would insist on mounting shoulder-belt attach 
points in the rear corners of the cab, too, even if it meant welding in a 
couple of plates to carry them.

Good luck --John Tomerlin
