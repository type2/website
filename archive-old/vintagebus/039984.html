I finally got around to checking out that old wrecking yard this afternoon 
that I found a few weeks ago.  It has not run as a wrecking yard for 20 
years from what the owner told me.  There are about 10 busses from late 50's 
to 67 plus other vw stuff (one oval)  and lots of other old cars of all 
makes about 5 acres worth.  Lots of good parts, Cal location so you might 
find some non rusty stuff.  I did not pay much attention as I was after 
deluxe parts and middle seats.  There were none that I saw in my ten minute 
jaunt through the yard.  There was a hatch top camper.  The owner is a one 
armed cranky old man so beware.  Just talk cars, dont act like a city 
slicker and he will come around.  It looks like he would rather sell whole 
busses rather than parts.  There was lots of trinkets to be had, but it was 
hot (can you imagine that?  in March?) and I did not feel like rumaging 
through all the stuff and dickering for parts. The location is in Yuba City, 
CA 1478 Garden Hwy.  Yuba City is about an hour north of Sacramento. I would 
give the phone number but it would likely not do you much good.  The owner 
is only around after 1 pm and there late as he runs a wrench turning shop 
there now.  Not open on saturday.  There is a red/white 21 window out front. 
  Easy to find.  21 is not for sale.  Have fun.

Gerald
