Hi Ya'll
 
I just bought a '62 bus, so I thought I would subscribe to the list. Is 
there anyone out there from Florida? Close to Gainesville would be nice. 
I need a few things for the '62, so if anyone has parts to sell, please 
email me off list. The bus had been or started to be changed over to 
12v. Im not sure what all was done, but I know it has a 12V regulator. 
The lights do not work at all. Does anyone have any suggestions as to 
what I should look for as far as it being changed over? I know I need 
windshield wipers. Will any years fit or will I need to find a '67? 
 
Thanks,
David
