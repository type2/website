Hi NQ!
hey,,, I am not sure i entirely understand how far you've got here,,, but
*I* understand you've torqued the engine complete to the rocker cover ,, on
side 1&amp;2 .....

I was a little worried here,,, I have found that it is much better (my
recommondation here) , to install BOTH sides of the engine ,,, snug each
one,, then final torque from side to side,,, so the case gets pulled evenly,

I have seen the crank journals in the case get &quot;skewed&quot; a few thou this
way,, and the crank gets tight in the bearings

Jamie
