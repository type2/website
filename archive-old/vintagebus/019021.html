Does anyone have a source for the following?  any help
would be apreciated.

1.  Cargo door screw hole plug's.  Clear ones. Need 8
2.  Dash clock mount tab's.  Need 2
3.  Spare tire mount bracket.  For behind the front   
  seat that goes over the threaded stud to retain     
tire
4.  Front seat back Rubber stop's.  (WW only has     
plastic ones)
5.  Westy tow hitch  (Still dreaming here)
6.  Heater box to body heater tubes.  About 2-1/4&quot; ID 
    and flexable plastic.  Not sure of the length.    
  Used ones that will clean up OK
7.  Splash Pan's. Rear bumper. Both sides.
8.  Good close-up picture of the front and back of a  
   full length middle seat side trim plate.  (I need  
   to re-do mine and need a guide) 

Thanks again for the help.  7 weeks to finish the bus
and counting.

Matt
