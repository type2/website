Subject: RE: [VB] pimpride steering wheels

  They are made by Flat 4 and sold and imported through Moon Eyes. They are
flimsey and would bend if you tried to pull yourself up in your bus with
them.
  Flat 4 only made them in Ivory and ISP is painting them black.

ronnie  hope this helps

&gt;There is a company that sells new steering wheels on Ebay (user name 
&gt;&quot;pimpride&quot;)  I going to buy one &gt;soon enough, there are 180.00 for 
&gt;ivory and 190.00 for black

What's the quality of these wheels? Anyone bought or used one? Are 
they made to be &quot;used&quot; or for show cars? Will it only crack and break 
a year down the road?
