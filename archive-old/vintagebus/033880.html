Just my (as they say) 2 cents worth here, but I don't drive anything other 
than busses these days unless I'm towing my (very heavy) car trailer to pick 
up another bus with my '55 Ch*vr*l*t Panel truck.  My 40 horse panel (every 
day driver), my '61 Double cab, and my '59 Westfalia seem to cover all bases, 
and I don't hesitate to take any of them on the freeway at 60 mph or so, 
although I do plan ahead which entrance I take with the 40 horse!

Drive 'em!
