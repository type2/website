&lt;&lt; I will also need tail light assemblys for for 55 pickup.  :-) &gt;&gt;
You will have to figure out if your 55 is a USA model or Euro with 
semaphores.  Quite often the semaphores were removed and the holes bondoed 
over or even just bondoed over in thier holes.  USA models have two wires to 
each tail light for dual filament bulbs.  Euros have only one for single 
filament bulbs.  So to use Euro tail lights in a USA model bus you have to 
buy an extra bulb holder from your FLAPS for each and rig them up for the 
signals.    Eric&amp;Barb
