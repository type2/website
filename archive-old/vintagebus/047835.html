In my 66 bus, I have this weird rectangular ductwork tube in the rear right
next to the left fender and I had Rob Laffoon of the VintagVW list look at
it and he, too, didn't know what it was.

Here's a message I got from Rob the next day after he looked at it
:
Hey Erin
Justin was looking through some heater manuals of mine and he came across
this picture and came over and showed it to me. this is what you have in the
back of your van. It is the original tube for hooking up a gas heater. talk
at you later
Rob and Justin
- - - - - - - - 
eberspa:chers and stewart - warners i have seen both installed original style 
in the area across from the battery )left).    there will be holes drilled 
down thrugh the bodywork there for exhaust tubes.     ductwork goes forward 
to heat the inside of the bus, llike you said rectangular and past the gas 
tank.    How about heater controls on the bulkhead unde rthe drivers seat by 
the regular heat control knob?    the extra konb with the little red light i 
the middle that lights up is eberspa:cher.   E has two knobs, beliwve S-W has 
one,  that turns.
