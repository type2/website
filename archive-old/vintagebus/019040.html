Well, I thought we'd of heard from the folks at the transporter speculation...uh I mean restoration shops by now, but they must be too busy counting their coin.  For all of you who were at BBBV, those of us at home and were board could check out the auction on speedvision. 

19K for a sundial??  I thought we were heading into a recession?

For what its worth I don't think this is good for the hobby... out of my control though.  Enjoy.
