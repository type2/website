Hi Casey,
Okay!  Now we are getting down to brass tacks!  
1.  For the single MC you bolt it in making sure you have about .030&quot; (A 
little less than 1mm.) between the pushrod and MC piston.
2.  Hook up all the brake lines. 
3.  Remove the brake sender.
4.  Fill the brake reseviour.
5.  Then either have a henchman push down on the brake pedal or pull it down 
from underneath.
6.  With your other hand put a finger over the sender hole and let up on the 
brake pedal.  This will cause a suction in the MC to pull in the brake fluid.
7.  Repeat #3 &amp; 4 until you get fluid out of the MC.
8.  Thread back in the sender.
9.  Make sure all the brake stars are tightened up till the brake shoes just 
rub here and there as you hand spin each wheel.  Start with the fronts and 
get a feel for this because the rears are also dragged by differential in the 
tranny so are harder to get the feel for the job.
10.  Bleed brakes begining with the one farthest from the driver's seat and 
do each closer one from there on.

Dual MC is slightly differant.
1.  For the single MC you bolt it in making sure you have about .030&quot; (A 
little less than 1mm) between the pushrod and MC piston.
2.  Hook up all the brake lines. 
3.  Remove the brake senders.
4.  Fill the brake reseviour.
5.  Then either have a henchman push down on the brake pedal or pull it down 
from underneath.
6.  With your other hand put a fingers over the sender holes and let up on 
the brake pedal.  This will cause a suction in the MC to pull in the brake 
fluid.
7.  Repeat #5 &amp; 6 until you get fluid out of the MC.
8.  Thread back in the senders.
9.  Adust all the brake stars too tight so the brakes drag alot.
9.  Bleed brakes begining with the one farthest from the driver's seat on the 
front axle and then the closer front brake cylinder.  
10.  Do the same with the rear brakes as #9.
11.  Adjust the brake stars so the brakes just drag here and there when hand 
spining each wheel.  Start with the fronts and get a feel for this because 
the rears are also dragged by differential in the tranny so are harder to get 
the feel for the job.
