4&quot; minimum is our code.  They would like to see 6 to 8 inches but code is
met at 4&quot; here in Beatrice.  I talked to several contractors and they told
me not to buy rebar rather, go to the local farm places and buy hog pen
fence panels.  They are galvanized and will cover a given area for far less
than rebar will.  I'm going to check out the price of them vs. my rebar
discount.
