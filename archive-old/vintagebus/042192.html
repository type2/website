&gt; I can agree on the using their logo without their permission on websites,

From my perspective you have it backward. I think that they should have a
liscensing agreement for logo/TM usage for clubs and websites etc. More of
a symbolic thing but it would protect their trademark in that case. In the
case of repro parts noone has the right to manufacture items with their
trademarks and logos which could be represented as OEM parts. What is the
purpose in making a repro part and putting a vw logo on there instead of
your own? Obviously to exploit the VW trademark or pass it off as VW. In
the third case of VW logo'd merchandise ie tshirts etc thats a bit more
complicated.
I think they would have been a lot better served by coming up with a
more hobbyist friendly plan.
