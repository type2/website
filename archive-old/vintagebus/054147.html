Subject: Re: [VB] Loyalty and Reality


&gt; How about just stating your location, so interested
&gt; parties can pmail?
&gt;
Some folks already have. I was figuring anyone interested can just Reply to
me, instead of the list.

But as to general info, I live in the &quot;Greater Reno Metropolitan Area&quot; in
northern Nevada. Aren't a helluvalotuv VW splitties out this way... but I
was also hoping my message could also serve as a general warning / reminder
to folks wherever they live.

Craig.
