Subject: 65 samba update and Thanks to all

Hello to all.  I was out tinkering with the bus the
other night and realized that it ahs been a while
since i posted any news on the bus resto project.

As Steve Harris said a few weeks back, the bus did
make my wedding.  I was able to get it done with about
a week to spare.  Teaching my best man to drive it was
nerve racking but he did a great job.  The bus is
looking good.  I have gathered about 95% of the parts
as of now.  What is missing are small items.

I took the bus over to Charlie Hammils the other day
to have him go over it with his keen eye.  He pointed
out a dozen or so details that i did not have correct.
 Nothing major.  Probably the worst was that my 2 back
windows are in backwards.  (I already knew that
though).  Mostly small details that are easy to take
care of.  I have done 14/18 so far and should be done
with the rest before the classic.

thank you to all on the list for the help over the
last 4 years.  Your collective knowledge has helped me
put this bus back to original.  

Thanks to all.

I will still be looking for a few parts for this bus
to finish it but for the most part it is done.  I hope
to get it into one of the mag's soon.  

Next on the list:  A quick resto of a lawn mower, a
1961 Double Cab and oh yes, all that house work i have
neglected while i worked on the bus.

Matthew
