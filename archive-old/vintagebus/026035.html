&gt; &gt;Like I said, it's a matter of where you want to spend the effort; if
&gt; &gt;I have a bus with rusty rockers, wiring all kapoiey, and super beelte
&gt; &gt;tailights sectioned into the back, and no brakes, the speaker would
&gt; &gt;be the LAST thing I did.

&gt; Thom, Having fixed many speakers I can say its not nearly as much
&gt; trouble to do then repairing rusty rockers. It takes not very much time to do
&gt; and is downright fun and rarely frustrating. So, since the stock speakers
&gt; often do sound
&gt; better than the radioshack crap it is worth the effort to me.

Ah common Thom and TF&amp;KLM, you know the feeling you get from lacing up a set of
wheels for a bike... Making something from wire, a hoop, a hub and *air* into a
thing of beauty that will get you on down the road. The magic of physics and
trigonometry and your hands. If you took all the time it took to lace and true it
and compared to a ditch diggers salery then the made in china wheel is a better
bargan. BUT...
It's a funky zen thing...
therapy for the gear head.Gee, Mr Wizzard keeno old speaker.
now if these guys wanna go all the way then they should build a crystal radio kit
to go with that high quality blankety blank speaker and convert their bus to run
on nebraska cow chips and solar power with a gas electric hybrid conversion like
VW* did in the seventies with the loaf bus.( there was a prototype, if i'm lying
i'm dying)

far out man

ken
