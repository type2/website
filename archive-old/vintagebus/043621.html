&gt;While I'm there with the speedo out, though, I'd really like to replace the
&gt;colored plastic bits.  Is there an easy way to get something that'll work or
&gt;do I have to hunt?

Theatrical lighting &quot;gels&quot;.  Basically sheets of colored plastic that
don't mind sitting pretty close to a 500W light bulb.  They come in
lots and lots of shades, but I don't know which ones are right for a
Bus.  I bought about three sheets a few years ago for something else
and they were about $5 apiece for about 2 square feet (0.36 m**2).
Check at theatrical supply stores in the nearest big city, or maybe go
over to your college theater department and bum some.  They might toss
them when they're torn, as they need clear unbroken 4&quot;/10cm diameter
circles or more, but you could easily salvage little 1/2&quot;-1&quot;/1-3cm square
pieces of the torn ones for your speedometer.  They are thin plastic
and cut with scissors.
