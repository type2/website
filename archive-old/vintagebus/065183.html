Amazing how you can ride when it concerns making the MD's Porsche
payments!

&gt;      I think I have enough book knowledge to try to
&gt; build my first engine.  I wanted to make a stout 1641,
&gt; 1776, no bigger than 1835, but with the new turbo
&gt; kturbo cityurbocity.  Do you think I can keep it cool
&gt; enough in a bus engine compartment.

The problem will be in cooling the engine while extracting all the power
the turbo produces.  Turbos are good for short bursts of power in light
cars, but the first time you climb a hill with your bus you will melt down
if you use the turbo's power.

The type 1 engine was pretty much maxed out in cooling when it was
enlarged to 1600.
