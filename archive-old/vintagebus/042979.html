Okay kiddies, 

The first rule for this list is that each message MUST have bus content,
Obligatory Bus Content - check the message you got when you subscribed. 
Only exception was on Fridays when BUS humour was tolerated.

When Ken ran the list, threads such as bashing Hoover and Insane women bus
driver were killed in short order.  People who consistantly disobeyed the
OBC rule (see above) were summarily dumped off the list.

why thom isn't running by these rules is a good question, but
nevertheless, the rules are to be followed or this list will lose its
value, and good folks will leave.

The kid who wrote the following post should be tossed, period.

nuff said,

cal
