It would be nice if it worked with the original poles.  If you do that,
you definitely expand the potential market.  As far as anal-retentiveness
to original, ie exact color, striping, etc, I think there's allowances there.
As far as the cut of the different panels, it shouldn't cost any more to
cut them original as to do it some other way.  A &quot;fit-reproduction&quot; of the
originals is my suggestion, ie make it interchangeable with the original,
fit the original mounts, etc.

I'll hazard that the awning-type tent is easier than the drive-away, and 
IMHO it's more versatile - you have options about which panels to put up
for various conditions.  The drive away isn't that much different than a
REI-type tent.  The awning types are great for just hanging out, setting
up a swap space, etc

Or what would be cool is one of the monster tents like on the westy ambulance
in the &quot;50 years of the bus&quot; book.

&gt; machines.  Here is the repro tent question of the day.  Does the tent &quot;have&quot; 
&gt; to be an exact reproduction of a westy tent or would a good quality tent that 
&gt; is very functional desirable?  What do you think functional is? ...with 
&gt; floor, without?  Drive away or not?  Any comments welcome.
