Subject: Re: [VB] '59 out of storage help

Gas shouldn't normally go bad in just one month's inactivity.  Try
taking the top off your fuel pump and see if it has gone dry.  If so,
pour a little gas in to prime it.  You may have to prime it a couple of
times before the engine catches fire.

If the top of the pump appears to be full, you could get someone to
crank a little while you pull off the hose to the carb to see if you're
getting pressure.  Perhaps you got some crud blocking the fuel line at
some point.

Or it could be something else...

&gt; I'm getting my '59 out of winter storage and am having a hard time getting it
&gt; to fire up. It started up fine last month. I think the battery is charged
&gt; well and it just cranks... that's it. I hooked a jumper vehicle up to it and
&gt; that didn't seem to help much. I was thinking I may try to go get a gas tank
&gt; and put some fresh gas in it tommorow.
&gt; Any other tips?
