It seems the only people supporting VW's new cars, are the ones supporting VW.

&lt;&lt; Even though I will probably never own a watercooled VW, you can't blame VW
 for changing their cars over time.  Our beloved VW's were designed to be
 economical and CHEAP.  These cars were built so people could afford to have
 one automobile for transportation purposes.  Times have changed!  Now it is
 not uncommon for people to have three or four autos in their stable.  If VW
 still manufactured a non reliable, maintenece needy, oil leaking, no heat
 having car; how many would they sell to U.S. customers?  Very few.  I am a
 Union worker and support buying new American automobiles, but I have to
 admit the quality and craftmanship in my girlfriends new beetle is second to
 NONE!  The old geezers on this list wouldn't support anything new.  I also
 think the new bus is ugly, but the fact is they still build a quality auto.

 P.S. I did dig the SC and DC computer altered pics though!  Especially since
 they were slammed!  Damn I'm glad to be young and un-grouchy!
