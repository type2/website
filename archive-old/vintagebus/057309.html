Subject: Re: [T2] VW CD's??

I've seen a &quot;Bentley on CDrom&quot; being sold by one of the reputable

&gt; It appears that someone has gotten their hands on &quot;official&quot; VW parts manual software on CD and is selling these on ebarf.
&gt; 
&gt; Does anyone know if these are being widely distributed and how legit they are?
&gt; 
&gt; Just curious- I am surprised that VWOA doesn't already have a team of lawyers on their case
