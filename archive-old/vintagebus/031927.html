&lt;&lt; &lt;&lt; does anyone know where to get those eyebrows for bus headlights. i see
them
 in
  magazines for bugs all the time but never for busi.

 Hi Mike, 
 They will fit not only bug, but bus and K. Ghia also.   Eric &amp; Barb
  &gt;&gt;Come to think of it they will fit just about every air cooled VW made
except type 4's and 914's.  Just be forewarned, if your gonna put them on your
early bus, you have to do a little bending to the eyebrows.  Just bend them
easy and slowly!  And I don't know if this helps, but I rub them and face
Hanover at the same time.
   Peace, Love, and don't mess with the louvered ones-they rust up pretty
fast.
     Mr. Bubble Head
