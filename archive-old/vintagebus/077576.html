Subject: Hiway 1-101

&quot;Back in the late 60's and early 70's I used to hitch hike from 
Newport
Beach, Cal to Gold Hill Oregon on a monthly basis. I always went Hwy. 1. 
Back
in the day&quot;

1968...I made my pilgrimage from &quot;So Cal&quot; to Oregon, drove my 54 chevy
sedan delivery, gave a lift to a &quot;couple of long hair hippies&quot; out of
Oxnard, plenty of (smoke) &amp; good-humored acquaintance, &quot;could have been
you ronnie&quot;

They were going to the &quot;Haight&quot;

No sooner dropped them off, than yep, another.....long hair... hitched with
me on north, my destination was Portland, he asked if I would take the
scenic route thru &quot;Fort Brag&quot;. Having not ever been farther North than
Topanga, this was a terrific trip.

As any one knows, who has traveled hiway 1 north on the Cal &amp; Oregon
coast it's a spiritual experience. Which ever route you choose. Take the time
to drink in all that's offered.
