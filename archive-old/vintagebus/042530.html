&gt; hey,
&gt; i knew that would get your attention. i was lookin around some personal 
&gt; websites waiting for 5 o'clock to roll around and i see some link to GEX's 
&gt; website on some dude's page. what the hell, i click on it and whats that i 
&gt; see... Thom's 56 sunroof on their main page. HUH! anyway, that is a great 
&gt; shot of his bus, it has been used before. i remember somebody made a vw site 
&gt; and used Thom's bus as the &quot;Samba Award&quot; given to people with cool sites.... 
&gt; Samba Award ;) thats funny
&gt; check it out: www.gexintl_dot_com

Not only does it look like Thoms (former) bus, it looks like one of Thom's
pictures from his website! (surfing trip to half moon bay if memory
serves)

I guess if they took pix of it from the new owner thats his business, but
im sure thom has ownership of his own pictures...

take care,

Steve
