Subject: RE: [VB] Fort Worth HELP

West Coast Classics did a few of the smaller versions. The one I got sleeps
4  on top and also came with 2 water tanks that attach to the side of it and
a portable kitchen with a 2 burner stove built in it. The ladder comes off
the side with a gang plank walkway to the entrance on the back. We slept in
it Friday night and it was comfy.

   Any of you Texans ever heard of Camp'otel Corp. in the Fort Worth area.
They are the manufacturers of the roof top tent (Car Camper)  I just got for
my Deluxe and am looking for any info I can find on it.
