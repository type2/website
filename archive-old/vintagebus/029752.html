 &lt;&lt;I was looking at the Wolfsburg West site because the E-brake boot is
missing
 
 from my '60 Double Cab and it says the boots are from May, 1960 - up.
 
 
 Is this correct?  Earlier Buses have no E-brake boot?
 
 
 Thanks,

 Both my 57 and 56 don't use them.
 I would guess the change would have been when they swapped to the syncro
 
 tranny and moved the ebake/shifter position.
