Hi,

I've got a walk through so-42 also.  It too is missing the seat.  I will build
mine as it is just a square piece of hard wood plywood with cushion and the
ugly mustard yellow vinyl.  Any good upholstery shop will have vinyl in a very
close color (almost identical).  The catch is that it will be MUCH thinner
than the original.

The bay window Westys that litter the bone yards (at least out here) have the
same material as the earlier 42's had.  You might just find a patch of it
large enough to cover the small seat.  Remember that it was attached on the
bottom with snaps, not stapled.

&gt; Hello everyone,
&gt; I am looking for the small square seat that goes between the icebox and the
&gt; seat behind the driver for a so-42 westy with the walkthrough option.  I
&gt; could build one if I could find the correct vinyl.  Does anyone have a
&gt; cushion or seat back with this vinyl? Don't be afraid to quote me a high
&gt; price.  That makes me want it more.
