Hi,

If you have access to old copies of Hot VW's, check out the
May 98 issue. There is a nice article about wheel
restoration. Shows the tool for removing (chisel) and
installing (special tool) the rivets.

Subject: [VB] Hubcap Clips (PC rims)


 Hey Guys--
 I went out to the garage this morning to POR-15 my seat
frames and take some
 parts I got in out there. I got my hubcaps in this week and
decided to make
 sure they were going on my freshly powdercoated rims
nicely. I put the 'caps
 on all the rims which aren't on the bus and they went on
fine. I then went to
 pull them off w/ a hubcap removal tool and they came off
along w/ several
 clips (the original VW ones). I now have 1 rim w/ 2 clips,
another 2 w/ 3
 clips, and one w/ 4 clips. All of these were powdercoated
over.
 So, I'm ordering some new clips from WW, but what should I
do to get the old
 broken ones of without ruining my Powdercoat job. Also--any
tips on getting
 the rivets on? Do I need a special tool. Help!!!
