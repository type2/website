&gt; Has anyone tried one of the two prong pullers to pull a Steering Wheel?

I tried the puller to no avail.

 I've
&gt; got to get this one off to sand and paint the dash.  Tried the old hitting
&gt; with a hammer and pulling up on it, won't move.

Did that for several days &amp; just cracked the wheel further.


Just went thru this procedure &amp; the method that finally worked for me was
Dan Kinsey's (that vw guy handle ) in the archives- Heated the outside of
the inside of the steering wheel hub w/ a propane torch for a couple of
minutes after putting pb blaster in the hub &amp; then pounded up on the bottom
of the wheel w/ my hands &amp; it came right off!

Tom Buese-my learning curve is usually long &amp; expensive
