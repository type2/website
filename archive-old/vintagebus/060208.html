Subject: bumper brackets

Does anyone have experience with the reproduction rear bumper brackets,
Specifically from Wolfsburg west?

I just received an order from them, and have always been satisfied with the
parts I receive, but the brackets seem to be half a**ed. The face that bolts
to the bumper seems as though it is welded on crooked, on both brackets. I
didn't want to have to deal with trying to repair bent crooked old brackets,
That's why I bought new ones.

Later,
 Bryan
