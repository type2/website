Subject: Split camper parts

Once before I asked about the similarity of parts from a bay window and now
I'm coming with some more. It looks like split and bay have some
similarities after all. In my area it's not very common to find a bus at a
grave yard but after visiting one today I found two 70ish bugs and a 73 bay
camper - some kind of conversion with a white top. Sprtsmen? Sprting?
something like that. The interior on this baby is in pretty good condition
and it would be a shame if I let it go this way into the crusher. 69 just
went in today, unfortunately. Would this interior fit my 64? Panels look
close and it is a walkthrough so....... Even has all the floor mats in and a
Z-bed. Would a front rubber floor mat fit the Split? Engine sits inside and
it's in pretty bad shape. I'm wondering how much these guys will charge?
There was an 82 Westfalia in very good condition as well, now this interior
I would want to see in mine, stove, sink, nice bed well too bad all these
have to go one day. If you are in the Chicagoland area and need parts for a
Bug or a 73 Bay you can find these at Victory Auto Wreckers. I'm off to
check some more places tomorrow. Does anybody know of any VW junk yards in
my area? I've heard of one but can't find it.
Well, TTFN
