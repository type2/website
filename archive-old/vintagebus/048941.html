Stephen:

There is a short section in the Bentley '63-'67 covering the gas tank and access.  It's located in the pickup section, not sure what page but you should be able to find it.

I had the same gas fume problem in my '60 Double Cab when I was using it for my daily during the painting of the '65.  It was leaking small amounts inside the under-bed-compartment, but with the panels in place I couldn't tell.  I solved the problem by draining the tank and putting the bus in storage.
