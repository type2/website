Sorry, but I tried for almost a year to do it in peace. I asked for help in 
a nice way and as you can see, Colin is not back peddling because he did me 
wrong and he KNOWS it. I spent months of my own time trying to get it 
straight with NC DMV, but I couldnt. But I have the proof Colin abd Eark 
told me one thing when I drove 450 miles and now he is telling the list 
another thing.

I dont get mad...I get even.

Thanks for your concern.

David

Guys...how about taking it private and leaving the list peaceful.

*sigh* *rolls eyes*
