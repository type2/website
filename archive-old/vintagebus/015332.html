Hi list, Yesterday morning I was on the Wolfsberg West site ordering some
bumper splash pan seals. I realized I was running late and had to rush to
work, so I didn't end up ordering.. After work I couldn't seem to find the
seals listed, so I phoned them, and of course they had no idea why!...This is
what I &quot;figgered&quot; out: if you goto search, and enter &quot;splash pan seals&quot; it
will only list 68-72, but if you enter &quot;splash pan seal&quot; it will list both
early AND late!! So remember to drop the &quot;S&quot;!! 
Hope this helps someone......
Michael
