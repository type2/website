Subject: Re: [VB] Clutch/trans problem

Hello all

First of all, thanks for all the previous advice.  I REALLY appreciate it.
Here is the update I promised you...

Well I replaced the clutch cable, with no apparent difference.  The pedal is
soft, with the only spring action appearing to come from the return spring
on the clutch lever attached to the trans.  This lever seems to travel
forward easily, a distance of about 2&quot;, and then seems to to a stop.   Does
that sound right?? Do I need to tighten the clutch cable further, until the
movement of the lever really begins to resist?

I am beginning to think that perhaps the the clutch itself has internal
springs that have given out?? Is that possible?  I have never had a VW
before, and not seen the clutch internals on this, but have done so on old
MG's. Again any ideas would be much appreciated.  I need to get the bus back
on the road, but do not want to pull the engine to check this out if I don't
have to.  I know they are suppose to be easy to drop, but I have never done
it, and I am sure there is a learning curve.

Thanks!!

Bob
