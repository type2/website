Subject: Re: [VB] Georgia collection of 20 VW's all for $2000.00

Now you know the crud (being nice for the kids) we have to work with on the
east coast!!!  

What you west coasters part out we think is a nice DD :)

And when I clean out a few bays I am picking up in a few weeks I am planning
on getting that panel if no one else does (yes in OK).  Probably in late
spring or early summer.  Unless someone else decides to restore it, a lot of
work.  Thom's is just so nice I that I have to mimic his success!
