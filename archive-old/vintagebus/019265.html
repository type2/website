Subject: any Yuma, AZ listees?
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

I just bought a 69 Westy in Yuma.

I have to either tow it here to Los Angeles, or get it
running (battery, ignition switch, brake adjust/bleed,
and shifter linkage lube).

Anyone who can help, you'd get a big debit in the
karma receivables column (as well as food/beer cash?
Evel Knievel toys?)
