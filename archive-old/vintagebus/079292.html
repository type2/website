Subject: Re: [VB] Mystery Cooling tin piece..please ID photo

That piece goes under the rear tin wher  it hits the cylinder tin... attached 
with the screws that point down there.   makes the airflow better for 
cooling.   That piece has the hole for the stock 1&quot; pre-heat pickup to go through... 
very nice.  There are lefts and rights.   Can't remember off hand which that 
one is.   

 There are also varietys for crooked breather/drip pipes and straight 
pipes... for 2&quot; pre heat, 1&quot; pre heat, and no preheat..  The early buses came with 
straight pipes, the 68 on crooked, afaik, and if you have a crooked pipe the 
straight pipe tin won't fit on the right.

Hey Y'all,
I am building up a 1641 longblock.  Yesterday I picked
up a box of cooling tin from a swap meet. There was a
piece in there that the guy said I need. I DO NOT
recognize it or know where it goes.  It is part #131
119 357, RMMW catalog describes it as:  Tin, Cylinder
cover\Heat deflector 1300-1600 cc.
Can someone please explain to me exactly where this
piece is installed. Heres a link to a photo of the
piece:
