hello 
saw your posting on crewcab wanted . while driving down the street the other day i saw one in a garage so stop to see if for sale . it was and had been newwly paint white nice job except for not removing wiper nuts and washers and a few door latches etc..all new chrome and complete and in original condition.needs some assembly but runs and drives. One problem the floors and bed were not repaired and need to be patched or?
 You did mention little or no rust this is probably more than you want but then again the rest of the car is finished so it would be faster to replace floors than redo a whole car body and paint .figure 2to3 weeks for decent body and paint on most busses or dualcabs i think cheaper to do floors. Anyway body gates bumpers etc all are done and very nice quality. Ps body and paint tech for 20 years
Let me know your thoughts jim in sandiego
