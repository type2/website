Mime-Version: 1.0

I pay $112/yr for my '66 Ghia cabrio through Haggerty classic insurance, at 
an agreed value of $12,000.  There ARE some caveats:

1.  It cannot be my primary car, and I must provide proof of insurance for 
my primary car.
2.  It MUST be garaged.
3.  It cannot be a work vehicle (duh).
4.  There is no mileage limit, but their &quot;guideline&quot; is 2500 miles/yr on 
the car.

Works fine for me! They are at http://www.hagerty_dot_com/

&gt;Man, you must be desperate for insurance if you're with Progressive!
&gt;They're known as one of the companies you &quot;have&quot; to go to if nobody
&gt;else will write you.  BTDT!
&gt;
&gt;Go thru the archives - this subject comes up every few months.  Basically
&gt;for &quot;collector&quot; insurance there are a set of guidelines as to condition
&gt;of the car, miles driven, storage, etc.  that must be met before they'll
&gt;write you.  Each company is different.  Some even require that you
&gt;own your house; they won't write renters!
&gt;
&gt;A search on the 'net for 'classic car insurance' will turn up some
&gt;helpful information.
