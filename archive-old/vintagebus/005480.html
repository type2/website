Subject: Singlecab rear rack and canvas cover

Hi all,  I have seen the canvas covers and wood slat replacements for the
rear cover on singlecabs, but does anyone know about the front and rear bars
that set the arch and provide most the integrity? Any close up pics on the
net that shows how/where the mount to the bed/gates? Are there pieces that
will need welding in? If so, are those pieces available?

Thanks again, --JJ
