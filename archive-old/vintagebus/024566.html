Hi Adam:
So what is a bus?  A freeway flier made to do 100+ all day long?  I
believe the original intent was an around town delivery vehicle.  It can
certainly be made into almost anything (a certain v8 powered version
comes to mind).  But how in tune are you with the essential busness of
it all.  Although many have removed them, I feel that putting a hot rod
engine in a bus with reduction gears in kind of wasting an engine and
stressing the bus with more power than VW intended it to have.  this
brings up reliability, maintenance, and 'Where you gonna find an
unobtanium at 3am in the fine town of Durant Iowa'? issues.

Just my thoughts, it's your bus.

Dave
