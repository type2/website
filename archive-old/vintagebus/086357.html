Subject: Alternator Pulley Failure

Hi Volks,

I have an interesting predicament.  For the second time in ~3 years, my alternator pulley has failed and in an interesting way:  the inner radius of the front (FIF) side of the pulley has sheared off from the outer radius.  Or put simply, the front pulley half is now two pieces, a large radius metal disk and a small radius metal disk.

Make sense? 

The last time this happened was on a different motor and different alternator, but the same fan shroud.  That was about 12,000-15,000 miles ago.  

I am thinking this is probably either my alternator pulley isnt lined up properly with my crank pulley, or that Im tightening my pulley nut too tight.  

Anyone have any experience with this? 

Bus is a 67.   The first pulley failed on a 1600 DP with a doghouse shroud, the second one failed on a 1600 SP  same shroud, different alternator.  The vast majority of the miles with the new pulley were on the 1600SP and new alternator.    

Cheers,
   Tom
