I need a little help please.  I put a 68 ball joint beam under my 66 westy.  
The rebuild went great, and bolted right up with no probs, except one little 
thing.  I couldn't remember which way the lower arms went with the ball 
joints pointing up or down, and I did not mark which was left and right when 
I took them to the dude with the press.  The upper arms were easy they point 
down no doubt.  The two books I have been using durning all my work on the 
bus have really screwed me, one book shows the joint up and of course the 
other shows ball joint down.  So I bet my luck and did them down.  I now 
think I am realy wrong.  Do any of you know which is right?

Steve
