Subject: 54 Barndoor Panel Price
Date: Sat, 31 Oct 1998 07:20:57 -0700
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

Finally got to talk to the guy with the panel in the pool (its out and
behind pool now) and
he wants $3000 for it, I offered $1500. What is the going price for a B/D
panel? This one is rust free and very straight. It has cut rear wheel wells,
not bumpers or brkts, no
spare tire tray, no tail or center brake lights(area where t/l go is also
cut up) semifores missing, dash is complete and has all switches/knobs and
ign. key, all interior panels missing, no motor, i'm sure complete brake job
will be needed, thats about it. Is $1500
to high ,or is it worth the 3k? Let me know your thoughts. Thanks
John Howard
