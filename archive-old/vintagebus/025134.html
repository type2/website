Subject: Some things are just too original
Message-ID: &lt;3723B503.6877_at_HiWAAY_dot_net&gt;

I am slowly taking apart my 67 Westy project.
Today I started on the front axle. I did notice it being completely
shot  when I bought the car. All 6 tie rod joints are so loose that they
might fall apart any moment. Also the shock absorbers had slipped off
their rubber bushings. King pins worn as a matter of course.
Amazingly the previous owner drove it like that. I feel like I saved the
car from the vandals.
When taking off the shocks I found them to be original VW. On closer
inspection I found a date stamped on them. They were produced in March
1967! These are the original shocks! Talk about a no-maintenance car.
I bought the car because I found it to be very original and untouched,
but this is too much.
I wonder what else I will find.
