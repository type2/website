There is a Westphalia, IA and I've been there.  Check out my homepage
http://home.ispi_dot_net/~elassley.bie/index.htm and look really closely in the
background of the top left photo.  It's a sign that reads Westphalia.  Town
park is behind the trees and the rest of the town sits atop the hill in the
background.  It's main bldgs are the big Catholic church and the tavern and
a few assorted insurance agencies.  That's about it.
