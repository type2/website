&gt;
&gt;Checking out the electrical, when I pulled on the
&gt;hazard light knob, the right-most fuse (16A red) blew
&gt;in an instant.  Does this mean that something on the
&gt;other end of that switch is touching metal/ground?
&gt;tip: blinkers don't work, nor do the brake lights.

Actually, the hazard switch is basically just activating
the hazard function of the dreaded nine prong box (it
grounds a wire coming out of the box).  But, a short
in your turn signal or brake wiring, which are downstream
of the nine prong box, could conceivably blow that fuse.
That rightmost fuse feeds the interior lights, horn,
and nine prong box (turn signals and hazards).  It comes
right off the battery - it's powered all the time.

The order I would probably check in:

* Scope out the wires around the fuse box and nine
  prong box (if you still have it).  Correct any
  PO wiring hacks before proceeding further - this
  may fix your problem right there.

* Check out the rear tail-lights.  Make sure the
  two tab terminals on the end of the socket aren't
  grounding out to the steel tube that goes around
  the base of the bulb.

* Check front turn signals.  You can see the backsides
  if you remove the front kick panels; check from the
  front too for any damage (center contact mashed into
  the side for instance).

* Test brake lights.  Pull off the wires connected
  to 54 (black/red stripe) and 54F (black/purple
  stripe) at the nine prong box and connect them
  to each other.  Turn on the key.  If the other red
  fuse blows right away, you likely have a short to
  ground somewhere between that fuse and the switches
  on the master cylinder.  If all is well, step on
  the brakes.  If the rear lights come on, great;
  if they don't and the fuse doesn't blow, the trouble
  may be in your turn signal switch; if they don't
  and the fuse blows, the trouble may be in the
  turn signal switch or the two wires from it to
  the left and right rear lights.

* Test turn signals.  Pull off the wires connected
  to 15 (black) and 49a (black/white+green stripe)
  at the nine prong box and connect them together.
  By turning the key on and operating the turn
  signal switch, you ought to be able to make the
  exterior lights on either side light up when you
  turn the switch that way.  (They won't blink,
  and the speedo arrow won't come on.)  If 
  second-to-the-end red fuse blows when you try
  either way, suspect your turn signal switch or
  possible further wiring hacks.  If it only blows
  for one side, check out the wiring on that side.

* If everything works fine when you jump around
  the nine prong box per the above, but fuses
  blow when it's hooked up, suspect that box.

Keep in mind that the above are just guidelines.  If
while puttering around you find a spot where a whole
bundle of wires provided a tasty snack for a mouse,
tape them up carefully and try again from the top -
you may have found the problem.  :)

I know I mention it a lot but it's cool:  Don't forget
the wiring diagrams Thom has kindly provided at

Good luck!
