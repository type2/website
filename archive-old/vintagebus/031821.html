I just got the shock of my life. A very good friend took his 64 delux in for
brakes and over $1000.00 dollars later, the highly recommended VW expert
shop, put the screws to him, or else my prices are way to cheap. What he got
was a NEW 67 only master, front wheel cylinders (varga) rear wheel cylinders
(varga) and rear shoes. No hoses, seals, front shoes, turned drums etc and
labor all this was done in the L A&lt; CAL area. I won't mention the shop's
name to protect the innocent, but boy did that hurt. The thing is did he
need all this, everything was new 3 years ago!

PS; he said the labor prices were straight out of their computer software
program, something like 146 dollars per wheel to change cylinders and they
gave him a discount!!!.
