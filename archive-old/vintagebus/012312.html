I have just had the most unpleasant experience with a vendor that
I have had in the whole time I've been working on my bus, more than
9 years now.  This comes from CB Performance, Farmersville, CA.

I wanted to buy a Snakebite Kit and a set of ratio rockers from them.
They agreed that since I was out of state I didn't need to pay tax on the 
order.  So I placed the order.  The money came out of the account.

Now this morning, I got a message that there was a problem with the order.
I called them up to see what was going on, and got the bum's rush.  I got
that
I got to pay the tax on the parts and when I protested to that I got the
most
rude talk that I've ever had by a public business.  It was &quot;God Damn&quot; this
and &quot;Son of a Bitch&quot; that.  I even spoke to Rick Tomlinson, the owner, and
he, even after getting the money from my account, cursed me and hung up
on me.  Before he hung up, he specifically said that the parts were on back

order.  But not 2 minutes before, his order taker had stated that the parts
would
be at AVP in Sacramento tomorrow.

I am not aware of why this was done.  I have spent over $8000 buying parts
and services from vendors such as Gene Berg, West Coast Metric, and others
including painters and restorers like Koch's, and Bus Boys.  I have tried
to use
the best parts and services that were available in Northern California. 
This was
because I had to rely on the bus when it was done, to drive this bus back
across the
country, almost 3000 miles as a shake down cruise.  All I wanted from this
vendor
was the parts.  I even offered to go ahead and pay the tax, because it was
a couple
of dollars cheaper to do that than ship the parts to Alabama and back to
California
to AVP.

What did I do wrong here?  Was I at fault for wanting to spend money with
this
vendor?  Is this the type of service we can expect from CB Performance? 
Does
this make them the SOUP NAZI of the VW world?
