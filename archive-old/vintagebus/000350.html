&lt;&lt; On my 66 there is a hose that runs from the heater boxes to the tube that

Hi Josh,
Not that we know of.  You would also need the muffler tube if these are 
missing to.  They cut down on the noise from the engine going to the 
interior.  You should be able to find these at swap meets, or junk yards.  
Just make sure to get the correct size dia. for your VW.  Very early 1964 and 
earlier VW used a smaller dia. than yours.
