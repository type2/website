Volks,

OK, I bought it...  so ya'll are on the hook to help me get it going :-)
The final deal was $500, delivered within 60 miles.  It will travel at the
sellers convenience, some time in the next two weeks to Pat Flynn's place
in Annapolis MD atop a flatbed, which relieves my first concern (worry
about towing with the at-least-20-year-old trans fluid in the redux boxes)

But...  I bought a nice set of rubber for it and want to get the tires
installed before it travels so I can move it about a bit when it gets
there.  I am headed over to Denton, MD tomorrow to bring and install these
tires, bring and install a rear glass, tape plastic over the holes in the
windshields, and remove the &quot;low vapor pressure&quot; items (cot, tool kit)
before they disappear.  

I am bringing my hydraulic jack and already run into a question... where
to jack?  The jack points are nice, so they are right out for the
hydraulic and I don't think the throw on this jack is long enough to get
the bus up by jacking on the frame.  On my Bays, I just stick the jack
under the axle beam in front, and will do that here unless advised agin'
it.  On the back I traditionally jack on the shock mount.  On a split, tho
that means jacking on the redux box, and I don't think that looks like a
good idea.  Soo.... Where do you put the jack?
