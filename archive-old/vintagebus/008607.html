Subject: Re: [VB] Heater Pipe question....

[...]

I just read what I wrote when it appeared on the list and I think I wrote it
backwards......
I will need to look under my 66 and 67 but I think the left side heats the rear
and the right side heats the front.




&gt; Because the right side of the engine heats the front of the bus......the left
&gt; side of the engine heats the rear of the bus. The right side feeds the heater
&gt; log under the rear seat on Standards and Deluxes......
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; &gt; Hi Real Bus People    I just crawled out from under
&gt; &gt; Ol'No Name and I have NO CLUE! Why the heat duct pipe
&gt; &gt; that goes to the front of the bus from the back on the
&gt; &gt; drivers side is capped off where the Y is at the end
&gt; &gt; of the heat tube at the back?..Why would the left side
&gt; &gt; just not hook into the duct work that runs to the
&gt; &gt; front?......It hooks up to a joint that looks like the
&gt; &gt; right side but it does not hook into the duct work
&gt; &gt; running to the front????? Got a clue?...dont need the
&gt; &gt; heat but what the heck!!!!
