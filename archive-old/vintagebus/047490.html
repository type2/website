&lt;&lt; Thats what i have, a schadek pump.  You have done this with a single 
relief case? &gt;&gt;
Hi Steve,
So far we have only instaled the vintage EMPI oil filter/pumps in our SR 
engines.  EMPI gears are 33mm diameter and 32mm in length.
  The Schradek oil filter/pump has 33mm diameter and only 26mm in length.  
  We have found a no-name oil filter/pump in the VW mags that has good 
qualities and 33mm diameter and 32mm length gears.  The only problem is the 
lower gear is pressed onto it's shaft and this shaft barely has any bearing 
suface sticking out either end of the lower gear.  Which would cause early 
wear and ovalization of both the bearing holes and the lower gear would move 
away from the upper.  This could be remidied with a hacksaw and hand drill by 
cutting the shaft in half after pressing it out.  Then making a spacer to 
push both ends/pieces of the shaft outward.  With a little carefull drilling 
the bores in the pump and it's cover all should work well.
  Since the Schradek oil filter/pump has shorter length same diameter gears 
as the vintage EMPI one it should be no problem in a SR engine case.
