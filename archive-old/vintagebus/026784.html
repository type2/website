&gt; Hi Courtney,
&gt; Doubt it!  Cheap oil is just like a cheap engine rebuild and usually results 
&gt; in the same result of needing another engine rebuild.    Eric&amp;Barb

Do you have some data to back this up?  All the data that I've seen shows
that, as long as the oil meets the API grade specifications, they pretty
much perform the same.  That's the purpose of having the API standards.
