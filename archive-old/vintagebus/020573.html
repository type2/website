&gt; Can a trailer hitch that is currently on a 65 be put on a 71?  The PO said
&gt; it is a Westy hitch, and it has a funky little gear mechanism(frozen) right
&gt; behind the ball.  I'm currently locked out of the 65 (Marital issue) but if
&gt; I pulled up in front of the house in my 71 with a little h*nda atv on a
&gt; trailer for her birthday, all would be forgivin' and the 65 would then get
&gt; the new brakes which are currently in hiding;)
