I just got off the phone with the VW Manual editor for Bentley publications
and was informed that they do have all the early 1959 and 1960-1962 service
and parts manuals but at this time have no intention of reproducing due to
lack of demand. I was told that if they recieve enough input that they will
consider it. So, send them your e-mails and bug them and it might come to
happen.
