Subject: aircooled corvairs clutch?
Mime-Version: 1.0
X-MIME-Autoconverted: from quoted-printable to 8bit by lenti.type2_dot_com id QAA70494

a few have posted in the past about corvair junkyards they have seen...wel my
friend drives a 64 or 65 corvair van(greenbriar i think) anyway his clutch
cable is on the way out...a little frayed....anyway these are NLA....I culdn't
beleive it, it is quite a complicated mess, the corvair parts supplier (i
guess there are basically only two, and one of the m is the main guy) only has
used ones....USED CLUTCH CABLES...for $200...i feel sorry for my friend so i
said i would post to the other aircools on the list on friday as it is kind of
off topic...but us aircooled need to stick together...any leads would be
appreciated...
