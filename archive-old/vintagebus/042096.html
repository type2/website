Well, if the engine was balanced with the flywheel in the equation (rare
these days on anything but a hand built engine by someone who cares), then
yes. Engine balance will be affected.

But the alternative is..none.  These flywheels do not have a replaceable
ring-gear portion to them..they are all one piece.

It could be done.  you'd have to machine the existing ring portion off,
and either fabricate a new ring, or machine the middle out of another
flywheel.  Then come up with a strong enough way to join them..
