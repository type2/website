--- Jim Bryant &lt;B10JPB1_at_wpo.cso.niu_dot_edu&gt; wondered:
&gt; How many on Vintagebus Registry?  Who else has one?

According to the search I just did, there aren't any. 
Then again, there's no way to search *just* the
M-codes.  Hey Thom, how 'bout a little update to the
search engine to search a specific column?  I did find
a lot of model 215 (Panel Van, Cargo Doors Right and
Left, LHD).  That would be a double door panel, right?

Paul
