I have used the aftermarket part that is sold as a repair for broken
accelerator cable ends.  It has a small set screw on one end that locks
down on a cable and the opposite end is slender and solid...the slender
end then slips into the barrel nut on the heater box and can be clamped
down.  
The only time this isn't usefull is when the heater cable is broken off at
the point where it leaves the tube the heater cable exits.
later
