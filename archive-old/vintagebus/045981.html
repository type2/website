Hi Brad,
First try jacking the engine up just a hair to remove the weight of it off of 
the bolts and try that wrench again.  If they are still stuck then you should 
be able to fit a socket wrench onto the nuts in front of the shroud.  Then 
have a helper reach around the forward side of the shroud opposite of what 
you and the socket are on and slide on a cheater bar to do the dirty deed.  
All you need is about 1/4 of a turn to win the battle.  Remember to &quot;Righty 
tighty&quot; and &quot;Lefty loosy&quot; the proper way!  Once you have the engine out at 
the very least you need to oil/grease those bolt threads, or better yet first 
chase the threads of the bolts/nuts with a tap and die.  Lastly make sure to 
install a washer under the bolt heads and under the nuts to spread the weight 
and cut down on wear into the soft aluminuim/magnesuim alloy of the engine 
and tranny case.  We also like to weld locking devices to the bolt heads to 
keep them from rotating while you are wrencking on the nuts in the future.
  Still sniggering after all these years, Eric&amp;Barb
