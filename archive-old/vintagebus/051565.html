Subject: Rear Bumper &quot;Hole&quot; for Westy Tent

List:

My friend Joe, who owns a '64 subhatch Flipseat Westy, needs help in locating exactly where to drill the hole in his rear bumper to accept the tent pole support for a large tent with privy room.  Normally this would be straight forward, if he had a slash rear bumper.  But since his camper came with a slash front bumper and pointed rear bumper (he also has a sales brochure showing this configuration) we aren't sure exactly where the hole goes.

A nice, clear digital photo would probably be good enough, and/or some clear description of where it is located in relation to the end, top, center horizontal peak running the length of the bumper, etc.

Any help is appreciated.

Robert
