This here is what you need, or something like it. Plus an operator.

I've rented these for around 2 to 3 bills a day. They are available in
capacities to 20,000 pounds or so and a reach of 45'. With it you can clear
a path to the target, set the outriggers down and reach out and snatch the
little darlin. I have used four-wheel drive versions that have tiltable
axles and planetary steering. They can crabwalk around a hillside and many
other fun things. Really need to find a construction company buddy and
especially check iron workers and drywall contractors. They tend to use
these the most, and if you make the right contact you might get them to rent
it and do the job for you for not too bad a price. These puppies run over a
hundred grand, so you probably aren't going to borrow one, but... say, have
you called a rigging company yet? They do this stuff all of the time.
Sometimes they want the moon, but if they only need to load the forklift on
a trailer, go snatch the bus, load it and the forklift and head home, they
might not be as bad as you think. You want to keep the time factor down,
because that is how they normally charge. There is a big Cat dealer/rental
outfit in your neck of the woods called Holt. Give them a holler and see if
they know someone with a rough-terrain reach forklift that might pull off
such a stunt for you. They have a website.

&gt;EEEk!  This bus is straight and dry enuf that I wouldnt' wanna hafta resort
to that!
