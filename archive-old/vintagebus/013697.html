hey all,
NQ's radio inquiry made me think of a question i have...
the radio in my early '66 (6v, now 12v) is original and all the wiring is 
still hooked up, doesn't work of course, but i want to know if its fried 
now. dont know how to test it. looks cool though in the uncut dash, so i 
will probably leave it in and mount a radio under the tray.

and about the bus hunt, i got a tip of a '66 with a sliding door somewhere 
in the area, gonna try and go check it out this weekend.. heard the body is 
mint too! also a '65 deluxe M130 i thought was sold last year that never 
was.
