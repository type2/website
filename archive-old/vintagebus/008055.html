Subject: My VW Check arrived

Do all of you recall those checks I talked about and posted pictures of a
week or 2 ago at:  http://home.ispi_dot_net/~elassley.bie/checks/check.html

I placed my order andf although it cost a whopping $75.00 for a set of 200
checks, I'm 100% satisifed.  The proofs they sent me are a little darker
than the real thing but as they state on the www.checksyourway_dot_com, they are
limited by federal guidelines as to how dark the photo on the checks can be.

I sprung for the extra options such as automatic carbon-through and a set of
4 repeating photos.  The best part is that if I ever want to reorder this
exact setup, then I'm only out $34.00 for a set of 200.

I've got about 5 of my old style checks left so once they're gone, I can
switch to my new VW checks and write 'em with pride!
