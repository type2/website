Subject: squeaking fan belt??
Date: Sun, 9 Aug 1998 11:44:18 -0700
Message-ID: &lt;19980809185116.AAA10902_at_moore.vcnet_dot_com&gt;

I've been getting this squeaking noise lately that I usually associate with
the fan belt.  Yesterday I decided to change the belt and when I had the
belt off, I ran the engine for just a few seconds to see if the noise quit.
To my suppress the noise didn't stop.  The noise sounds like something
rubber would make, not metal.  At higher rpm's the noise goes away.  I've
looked behind the crankshaft pulley for something jammed back there and
didn't see anything.  Does anyone have any ideas?  I can't imagine seals
making this noise.  I'm going to look in the distributer today and check the
cam for grease.  Thank you for the comments.
