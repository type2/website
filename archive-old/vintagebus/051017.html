 The trip was awesome. I traveled from San Diego and was glad I made the =
trip.  We took our buses where most would think twice.  We got to put cha=
ins on and play in the snow, travel the back roads of northern California=
,  and the ice fishing turned out to be pretty good. What a great trip,  =
I will be sure to make the journey next year.  I posted some pictures of =
the trip on the Sv2s website...
