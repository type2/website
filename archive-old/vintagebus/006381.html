I still have the original tent from my fathers 72 westy that we used in
europe and all the bags and OG hardware and stakes, if your interested I can
p-mail you some pics. The pole bag was heavy duty grey material like the
floor of the tent and the stake bags were orange light weight canvas, the
tent bag itself was dark brown with a tie string on the top end. Also the
guy strings had small aluminum slide tensioners on them that said germany on
them.
