The Thing, or more properly the VW 181, was designed to be a military
stop-gap vehicle until the Europeans could design the &quot;Euro Jeep&quot; (which
never happened).  The military versions came with a crank start set up.
Unlike other models the rear tin had no swinging cover for the crank starter
hole because the exhaust was a two piece design with the mufflers on the
side.  On another note all Things (181, Thing, Safari and Trekker) came with
the crank start handle supporting hole in the rear bumper.

I have heard in the past that Thing crank nuts are different from Bug/Bus
crank nuts.  True/False?  If true, what is the difference?

And why would Things have crank nuts?  Wouldn't they have 1600cc engines?
