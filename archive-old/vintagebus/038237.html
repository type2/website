Subject: Jumping a 6 volt.

If you are stuck and can't compression start your bus and need a jump start
for your 6 volt, it is easy.
Just have who ever is giving you a 12 volt jump to your 6 volt system to
turn on all their lights, radio, etc. and NOT have their engine running.
This usually drops their voltage a little.
Have someone ready to pull the negative cable off their battery as soon as
you get fired up. Simple.
I've done it a couple of times to 6 volt buses with no problem, and never
blew a fuse. Just make sure every thing in your bus is switched off, or you
will blow stuff out.
