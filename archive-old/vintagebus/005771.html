This is an indication of poor front end condition. Steering in good
condition should track well and be left free. On occasion I have tied the
front wheel on a bus if the front end is so worn it will not track. It is
extremely hard on the tires to drag them sideways around corners. If the
front end is in good shape and the toe-in is correct, it will follow you all
day.

&gt; &lt;&lt;You need to leave the front wheels free if you want the bus to follow
&gt; you around curves.&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Correct me if I am wrong, but I don't think this is correct. . . I think
&gt; the steering wheel needs to be tied.
