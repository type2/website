&lt;&lt; does anyone have a Bentley manual for a 63?  I don't think it would be
 just for 63.  maybe 55-63 or something?
 Either way, I could really use one as I'll be going hardcore on this
 rustoration as soon as my welding is done.
 I would either buy it or trade something for it...just let me know.
 thanks!

you want the one they sell, the 63 edition updated through 67.   It's 
reproed.  Has great line drawings of panels and crosssection really nice.  
Don't know why they reproed it in only black and white, they could have at 
least put colour in the wiring diagrams, but apart from that its a great 
thing that it was made available.
