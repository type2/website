Subject: Re: Small Nut in a B/D

Won't work. B/D have a narrower rear torsion setup, thats why sedan
tranys will bolt right in a B/D. You would have to get different
spring plates also and make 1 1/2&quot; alum spacers for each side. I'm
sure more listies will repley to this one. I think you need a B/D
only reduction box trans. or keep the sedan one in.
