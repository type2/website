Subject: RE: [VB] Does your bus tow a trailer?

I just mounted my backyard-made hitch this morning to tow a pretty heavy
trailer around.

The hitch is cut down from a standard chevy/ford truck hitch and
modified to bolt directly to the frame of my bus. It's not pretty, but
should be looking nicer once I get it cleaned up a bit and painted.

The rear bumper brackets are integrated into it, so that the bumper
attaches to the hitch rather than the bus. The only drawback is there is
a slot cut in the center of the bumper where the ball tongue goes
through it.

I can take some pictures after work if anybody is interested in seeing
it. FYI - PO made it, not me. I'm better at cardiac surgery than
welding...

If so, contact me.  I want to put a hitch on my 60 truck to pull light
loads.  MANY people have emailed offlist wanting to do the same, but no
solutions yet.  Looking for recommendations, parts source, etc.  Any
advice appreciated. Jay 60 Double Cab
