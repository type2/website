Subject: Re: [VB]slider deluxes /was front seat area? 

hmm.. I would have thought that the 164 should be on the m code tag.  Then 
again, I have been unclear about the 4th digit of the model # stamped into the M 
code plate

Ya, I'd double check all 3 VINs on your bus.. stamped in engine compartment, 
on m code tag, and on tag riveted to the air vent.   But you don't have m 130 
(with-out sliding sunroof) which the hardtop deluxes came with, arguing 
against it being a roof transplant survivor.

I heard those UK buses suffer salt rot and usually have had welding done on 
the lower areas... I take it it doesn't look like the subfloors were just 
removed and not replaced during old rust repairs?
