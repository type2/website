&lt;&lt; Diameter, radius what's the difference?  The diameter is about 26.5 
measured horizontally. If you measure the radius from ground contact to the 
center, you will find that the bottom of the tire has flattened slightly 
depending upon tire pressure and load.&gt;&gt;
Hi Chris,
The differance is of 26.5 about 2.5 MPH faster at 50 MPH than a 25&quot; diameter 
tire and 4.125 R&amp;P.  With a 3.875 R&amp;P about 5 MPH at 50 MPH.
If you measure the horizontal diameter shoulder to shoulder it is just a bit 
more accurate.  You actually halve any measuring mistakes by taking the 
diameter and dividing that by 2 to get you raduis.  Unless you are running 
around with tire pressure of ten or more pounds lower than they are rated the 
tire you are running on the circumferance not the crushed raduis while 
parked.  Kind of like a tank track of 6' circumferance you just do not try to 
measure the vertical radius of the bogie wheels to figure out how many feet 
it covers in one turn of the track.
We figured many years ago what MPH _at_ RPMs for our first rebuilt bus tranny 
exactly with a formula we figued out all by ourselfs.  We asked for a tranny 
that would do 55 MPH _at_ 3,000 RPM and when we figured out the gearing when we 
got the tranny and paperwork with it we came up with 47MPH!  Called the shop 
that sold us the tranny but did not rebuild them and asked if we had made a 
mistake and was told not to worry it would do 55 MPH _at_ 3,000 RPM.  Installed 
it and found it would only do 47MPH _at_ 3,000 RPM and spent a trip from the 
Seattle area to Iowa going slow.  
We also have called up numerous tranny rebuild shops up and down the west 
coast and have found they all use the same formula which agrees with our 
first formula exactly.  Being that niether of us are great at math, we were 
surprised at how well we did on our figures!

  Your engine RPM will be dictated by the radius not the diameter. &gt;&gt;
Actually by the circumferance.  Radius and diameter are just a reflection of 
this.
