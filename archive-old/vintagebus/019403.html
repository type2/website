Well, it does have that desirable(?) characteristic, as well.
However, as a brewer, I feel fairly confident in saying that that's
not the primary purpose; the savings from not having to rinse the
sterilant out in a continuous-process production facility is pretty
significant.  The flavouring is just one of those serendipity
things....

Different acid (and we'll ignore the normal flow of material
undergoing digestion) - hydrochloric vs phosphoric.  The latter is
less aggressive in similar concentrations.  If I had to deal with
getting splashed with either, and had a choice which one, I'd
definitely pick the phosphoric, even at higher concentrations.

Definitely.  Note that it does *not* form an impermeable seal.  If you
just leave it on, the existing rust will get converted, and then
what's underneath will starting rusting/flaking as oxygen slowly flows
through the jelly.  Quite annoying, actually, if you get called away
after putting it on, and are significantly delayed in getting back to
it (like, say, overnight).

Note that the &quot;rinse, dry&quot; part of the above may also include &quot;wire
brush&quot; and &quot;repeat&quot;, depending on how bad your rust problem is.
