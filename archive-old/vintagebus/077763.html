That was bad news. All of the bellowed thermostats I have had or seen
have stayed captive and the flaps were just forced to stay open.

	Hello Raymond    The one that I had that overheated so bad had
bellowed completely out of the bracket so that it had pulled the flaps
closed, this was on a type 1 motor. Also I still have the therostat on
my 36 hp that is in my 51 std bug, ( the motor is a 1953 year) later and
have fun  Mark Dearing  Salem Import Service  Salem Va
