Subject: Re: [VB] My apologies

Not IN the engine compartment.   standrds and deluxes (or was it  just 
standards) had tar paper strip ove the engine bump, and down the slant in  front of 
it.  on top of the engine, the stanadrds had a hardboard panel,  the deluxes 
had carpet.   Many people consider adding modern  soundproofing to their buses. 
  Howeverm a well buildt, tuned machine  should have a pleasant sound to it.  
Road noise is distnact, though, I hear  a big difference when I cross the 
line onto a newly paved stretch of  road.    Probly should add sound proofing, eh?

OK here's a question then, did the 67  and earlier have any noise reduction
in the engine department? I had a 60 in  1972 and I don't remeber any on that
one either. Maybe the  Deluxes?
