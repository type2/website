Hoping to remove the cargo floor from my 21-window this weekend and would like some wisdom. The outer supports running length-wise on the bus are pretty rusted out. Should I plan on welding in some supports to keep the bus from caving in under it's own weight? I may have to move this bus after I remove the cargo floor and before I replace the cargo floor. Should I postpone this part of the project until I have cargo floor supports?

I'm planning, btw, to use an air chisel to knock out the spot welds in the floor.

Thanks! Joe
