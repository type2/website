there are fine cracks that are soaking the cloth wrap enough to smell, but

Hi Tom,
Not a good thing to hear!  Yes, it could be that you have seeping flex fuel 
lines that are giving you the gas smell.  Though that would more likely be a 
constant thing instead of a 15 minute order after shut down.  
   Instead next time you shut down your engine when you get home.  Check the 
throttle shaft ends sticking out of the carberator for gas leaking out.  If 
it is then give us a holler and we can go over the possible remidies.
