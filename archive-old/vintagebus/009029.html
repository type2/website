Well, it all depends on how you look at it. I like the idea of having an
auction site like this. It might not bring you as much money as e-barf
would. It's more like helping each other out. I've dealt with some of the
listees before and know that these guys were not at all trying to make a
profit. I would do the same. What I want to say is that it was a good idea
Thom to set-it up. Why would you want to name your site after e-barf? I
wouldn't do that and not only because of the lawyers. Split auctions sounds
a lot better. Bay? let the 1967 and on Bus enthusiasts pick that name.

Just my 02 centavos.

Peace on earth!!!

I've also had a few suggestions to call the site &quot;V-Bay&quot; and &quot;VW-Bay&quot; -
whadday think?
