&lt;&lt; One other question if you don't mind, relating to my ongoing clutch 
disengagement problem.  My ongoing problem is tough 1st engagement and unable 
to select reverse with the motor running.  Big tranny.  All other areas( 
shift bushings, cable, bowden tube, adjustment, T/O, gland nut, engine 
alignment, etc.) have been eliminated.
  I'm running a stock 200 mm 3 arm German clutch.  Is there any way to tell 
if one
 of the clutch arms is not fully disengaging the clutch plate while the motor 
is
 on the ground and the clutch is still installed?  The Bentley shows a very 
cool
 tool they use to accomplish this (which of course if NLA).  What should I 
look
 for when I remove it to tell if it is not functioning correctly.I've fixed or
 replaced everything but the pressure plate, and have to find out the problem
 before I mess up my nice tight tranny.
  BTW in the July HVW's they have an article about clutch replacement that 
states
 their problem was a few fingers of a diaphragm clutch were not returning.  
Their
 symptoms were identical to mine.  The only difference is my clutch is the 3 
arm
 type.     Thanks a bunch!     Steve &gt;&gt;
Hi Steve,
You might want to check the clutch disc just inside of the clutch material 
for any signs of rubbing.  If nothing there you should try replacing the 
pressure plate and see if that makes a differance.  If no improvement then at 
worse you have a spare pressure plate on hand for the next time.  It could 
also be a bent clutch disc or it's splines are too tight on the input shaft.  
The rear tip of the input shaft could be worn too much causing the end of it 
to wobble in the FW gland bolt.  We have had problems with a slight amount of 
oil getting to the clutch and creating a vaccume between the disc and FW.  
This tended to affect the VW only at start up at first and sometimes second 
shifts and then would go away.  Found that scoring by hand the FW disc 
surface about every inch or two radially measured at the OD with the side of 
the tip of a drill bit relieved this vaccume.   Eric&amp;Barb
