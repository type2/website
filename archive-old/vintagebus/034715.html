&lt;&lt; a small business that your life no longer is personal but now public

 But here I am and now here it goes once again for all to talk about for
 months to come.
 =============
 I was not talking about your personal life,  sorry about the 
misunderstanding.
.........................
 experience I hope can understand.  PLF has always been my business although
 my ex-husband was highly involved for the time we were together when 
we..(snip)  My
 ex took custody of the camper in question, the furniture and household items
 and much of PLF property that has not been turned over to me.  When I took
 possession of the Panel I also took the remaining debt of $900.00 due to the
 original owner still.  My ex took the Camper and any debt of which it
 initialed the &quot;Spice Rack&quot;.  I have to pay remaining debt to the panel the
 ex is to pay the remaing to the camper.  Which was a part of the deal we
 made with Clara Williams in trade for a SO-44 camper interior.  this is a
 legal and binding divorce agreement and debts should be taken with the
 responsible party.  Clara I though maybe of all people you might be a little
 understanding being you are in Seattle you could see what was going on and
 you also had a not so good brake up with Rain and had much confusion then.
 I apologize I no longer live in Seattle for the time being and no longer
 have control over Steve and cannot get him to respond to you but since you &gt;&gt;

------------
It is exactly because of Dawn doing the PLF thing and being active in westy 
circles that last July when we made this deal I agreed to take a spice rack 
later.  Because of *her* reputation.  Steve never had that.  Without it, I 
would have never agreed to that.    Joking aside, I really did not think I 
made a deal with that camper.  If the camper had been wrecked the deal would 
not be void, if it had been sold to a third party, the deal would not have 
been passed along.  I am sorry if you wanted to keep the camper and felt he 
was unkind about it.   It seems unrealistic to want to switch the deal to 
Steve solely, and not bother to call me and talk about it.

It really surprised when I talked to her in April, that she was nasty about 
it.  Because we had always had friendly interactions before.   Somehow that 
made me less sympathetic.   

Yes Mike and I had a icky breakup some years ago. Ended up selling the 54 
kombi.  Ya he kept somethings I should have. Sure everyone gets that feeling 
in a breakup, cause you can't cut one pie into two pies.  Things personally 
generally are problems.
 But I made sure none of the deals we had made got reneged on, or delayed for 
months on end, as that affected me.  Confusion ? yes.  Of course, anything he 
did afterwards is and was his own business, as I firmly but politely told 
people who asked me about various things for the next year or so.     

But this deal was made almost a year ago. I understand giving some time, but 
I guess I am being asked to be understanding to the point of forgiving the 
debt, because of your personal life?
  
Yes I have talked to Steve, who said he really doubts he can find a spice 
rack, but if he did he would get it for me.   Hardly in the original intent 
of the deal, but a try at least.

Someone emailed that there were three spice racks at the Classic.  

Clara
