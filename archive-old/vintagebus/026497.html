&gt; .
&gt; It doesn't leak, but braking is a little weird sometimes and takes an
&gt; extra pump to make the pedal firm (I've already flushed and bled it).
&gt; All wheel cylinders have been replaced or rebuilt, and the hoses are new.

Larry,

You don't mention if you replaced the drums.  A 32 year old car is bound to have
worn out the drums by now, and you could get new ones for about the same price as a
67 master cylinder.  Just a thought before you replace stuff that might not be bad,
get a micrometer and check those drums, I'll bet you 10 bucks they are out of spec.
