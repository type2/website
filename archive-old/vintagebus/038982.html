&gt; Jason scrawled:
&gt;    RMMW lists them as:
&gt;     &quot;211 501 249, Plug, Gear Reduction Housing, L or R, '64-'67 type II,
&gt; $4.95 ea....&quot;
&gt;     1-800-258-1996 is their #.
&gt;     you were looking for *plugs*, but no affiliation whatsoever.... :)
&gt;
&gt; These plugs are plastic, not the metal ones.  The metal ones are
&gt; expensive.  I just put the plastic ones on and they seem to be ok since
&gt; they hide behind the spring plate for protection. RTV them good before
&gt; installation.

That's exactly what I did and they haven't leaked a drop, and it's been
over a year.  The plastic has a triple-fin seal like the kind used on
plastic &quot;corks&quot; in cheap champagne bottles, and it conforms to the metal
better than a sheet-metal plug that just got welded.  I also used a liberal
dose of RTV, and saved the metal plugs just in case, of course.
