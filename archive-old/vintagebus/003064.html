&gt;&gt;I had my '63 Deluxe, rag top, red and white on top, no middle seat,
&gt;and ca
&gt;&gt;plates stolen yesterday, day before thanksgiving from Burbank in  so
cal.  Any info greatly appreciated.  Please!  Thanks.


Okay, now I'm gettin' scared! Two stolen bus posts in as many days!
:-( Not that I have a problem here in NE Florida as no one here has a
clue what my Magic Bus is all about, but we're planning to go to
VolksFest in Miami in February where apparently MANY people will
understand Magic's value and I'm more than a little worried about the
possibility of having to come home in a rental car!!! = {  Does anyone
have or know what kind of security system you could use on a bus with
too many windows and a big ole hole on top? Sounds kinda silly as this
is no &quot;Cal-look&quot; bus or anything, but she's MINE and I'd like to keep
it that way! :-)  Thanks!

P.S. JAKE, I really hope you get your bus back! You must be very SAD!
