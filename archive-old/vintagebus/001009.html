Yeh, I did meet George, carpenter extrodinaire. He did have some stories,
and some nice loafs sitting in his yard.

&gt; The same!  But it isn't saved just yet ;-)  Did you get the chance to meet
&gt; George?  Man did he have some stories to tell about that bus...Dave
Easterwood
&gt; even remembers him as being quite a motorhead.  He's been out of buses for
&gt; quite some time now, when I used to keep in better touch with him he was
trying
&gt; to put a bay Westy back on the road, but I don't know how that went or if
it
&gt; went at all.
