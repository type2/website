Subject: Re: [VB] Dual circuit master cylinders

Paul,

When you get access to the net again, you can look at the archives and 
see a long thread on this a few months back. The short answer to your 
question is: Bigger piston diameter at the master cylinder means more 
pedal effort to stop the bus. The late model bus master cylinder means 
you have to push about 10 to 15 percent harder. That's a noticable 
amount. I have the late cylinder in my bus and I'm not real happy with 
it. I'm getting a '67 cylinder pretty soon.

&gt; Does anyone know how piston size changes the braking effort required to
&gt; produce the same amount of braking force?
