Hello all!

I've been on vacation for a week and I'm going through my back
list mail.  There's been some talk about how VW dealers were
required to throw out/destroy their older spares after some
time.  At least in the US, there is a probably a tax reason 
for this.

A friend of mine is a writer ( http://www.elvendude_dot_com ) and
in the book business, it is common to send warehoused copies
of unsold books to the shredder after a few months.  The
reason is a court decision that made companies liable for
tax on warehoused inventory.  This isn't just books...it's
finished goods, and car parts as well, I would assume.

After some point, the balance of &quot;having items on hand to
meet demand&quot; vs. &quot;paying tax on items&quot; tips in favor of
ridding yourself of them.  The book folks would rather
make a small print run that sells out and then do another
if the demand is still there, then make a big run and end
up writing part of it off.  This also affects how the
writer gets paid!  VW's accountants probably did the math
and came up with the time period for their dealers.  I know
that this law has existed at least since the early 1980s, so
some older parts may have escaped.

Switching gears, I was on vacation visiting my sister
in Germany!  She's in Stuttgart and I was only there for
a week, so I didn't make it up to Wolfsburg.  About the
only split-bus related events on the trip were finding
a set of 5-lug rims in the basement of her apartment
building (196x date code - a bit rusty and hard to read)
and seeing one defunct splitty out the train window between
Augsburg and Munich (it was just out of Augsburg, on
the right side as you go towards Munich, in somebody's
back yard/garden).  Looked like a Standard...it was
pointing away from the train, and had been bonked by
maybe a falling tree right over the cargo doors.  Either
both cargo doors were wide open and/or had been removed...
looked like it was more of a garden shed than anything.
Don't know the year but it was post-BD and pre-bay.

On the streets, I saw lots of Vanagons, both air and
water.  I saw a couple of bay-window campers running
around, but no plain bay-windows.  Saw just a few
full-body Eurovans...most of them were the Eurovan
equivalent of single- or double-cab pickups.  The
last time I was there, Lufthansa still had some
bay-window service vehicles at the airport, but
these were all now Vanagons.

I did go to the Porsche museum in Stuttgart - free
and highly recommended.  There is also a factory
tour, but they are shut down right now for the
model-year change, so no tours.  Even though the
museum is free, they won't let you roll the 356
engine display out the front door.  Darn.  :)

For the trip I had a brand new digital camera, so
I'll have a pic or two up on the Web site soon.  I
will also now be able to use the digital camera to
take pictures of greasy Bus bits to go along with
my enquiries to the list.  :)  Don't worry, I'll
post a link to them and not attach them.
