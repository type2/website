Hi all,

We are back from our jaunt to the jungle... 

Saw hundreds of ACVW's so many busses that we couldnt take pictures of em
all...

Quite a few Brazillian 15 window baywindows were spotted (15 window back
with a baywindow nose)

Almost got run over by a splitty kombi... (narrow road both of us going
well over 40.... close call)

I'll probably be HTML'izing a lot of the pictures soon... hope to see some
of y'all at the junebug jamboree next weekend.

Its nice to see the world but its good to be back too :)

Take care,

Steve

P.S. Costa Rica is the second most dangerous place to drive in the world!
whats the worst? why the USA of course...
