I know that many people dont like scoops on thier busses. And I know people
say they might be bad. But I ran several tests with mine off and on, and
found they did lower temps by several degrees. I have never had a problem at
low speeds, and during freeway travel they have helped the 63. I am debating
on using them though. The few degrees cooler doesnt matter much in my cool
running engine anyways. And I too  dont really like the look of them that
much. 

On a side note, one came loose on a freeway in Montana. I was thinking I
could make it to the next rest stop (1 mile), and fix it. But I guess I
shouldnt have waited. It flew off, I watched the whole thing in my side
mirror. It hit a mini van in the next lane, exploding into a million pieces
(fiberglass). It hit thier grill. I slowed down a little, getting ready to
pull over to exchange insurance information, I was ready to do the right
thing although I dont think I caused any damage to the other car. But they
looked freaked out, by the event and my bus, they stomped on the accelerator
and passed me at who knows how fast and dissapeared down the freeway!
