Subject: Re: [VB] inside the aluminum case from hades

&gt;#1) The cam plug normally goes the other way, hollow side in.

no more autostick manuals on my benchtop!

&gt;#2) Your cam bearings look like the came out of a 60,000 mile engine.
&gt;Valve springs too tight? or cam too tight in case? Mic the journals.

springs might have been too heavy, but everyone said to run em - scat 
HD single springs. i am back to stock, shimmed out on a .060 spacer. 
cam journals are fine, but i'll have to try to borrow tools to mic 
the bore.


&gt;#3) The only explanation for the main bearing wear is that you processed
&gt;some trash through them, if you had a good polished crank at the
&gt;beginning.

that would be all the casting CRAP that shook outta the case and flew 
around before the fullflow got it. mind you, this case had been 
CLEANED like 6 times.
&gt;
&gt;My only other thought is that you had temporary oil starvation that
&gt;somehow didn't get monitored by your gauge or idiot light sender. That
&gt;can happen if your oil is foaming bad.
  possibly - it would have happened during breakin, maybe during cranking?
