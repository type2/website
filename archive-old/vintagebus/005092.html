&gt;To all.
&gt;The Wolfgang kit looks like a good idea and a good $ deal.
Still uses calipers and rotors from 72-79
&gt;buses and the narrow 5 wheels.

I got  adapter plates with mine that allow the use of the wide 5 wheels. The
trade-off is that it moves the wheel out about 3/4 inch. I'm going to
investigate the possibility of making my own adapters which will put the
wheels back where they belong. I don't have all the pieces yet, so I can't
say if it's possible or not.

. You still need the
&gt;pressure reducer for the rear end. If you don't use a &quot;disc brake&quot; master
&gt;cylinder, don't forget the 2 lb check valve.


I purchased the disc brake ('71-'79) master cylinder for $40 plus the
adapter kit for another $40. Much cheaper than a '67 master cylinder.
