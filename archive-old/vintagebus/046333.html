&lt;&lt; how  deluxe trim bonded to the bus (im getting it off a 13 window deluxe
this
 weekend _at_the junkyard)?screwed on ? clips? adhesive?
 this may sound like a stupid question but, hey, ive never owned a deluxe:) &gt;&gt;

Srewed on.  Take several screw drivers and/or a screw driver with replaceable
tips.  If the screws are rusted in theyt can be a real booger to get off and
will mess up several screw drivers in the process.  I have messed up several
Craftsman screwdrivers removing the trim but at least I can exchange them
when the tips break off.
