Subject: Re: [VB] Sealing screw holes for Deluxe trim

&gt; I have a deluxe in which I need to seal up the holes where the beltline
&gt; trim screws in because the trim isn't reay to be put on and I'm going to
&gt; be driving it in the rain. Any suggestions on how to keep the water
&gt; external?
&gt;

If you are talking temporary, as in a month or so, go to Home Depot or your
friendly neighborhood refrigeration and heating supply. Get you some of the
aluminum tape used for sealing a/c ducts. Not the regular duct tape, the
real metal stuff. Wipe the spot with alchohol and stick a piece on. Good
adhesive, stands up to weather well. It'll stand out like a turd in a
punchbowl, but it will keep the innards dry. Keep the pieces fairly small,
the stuff can be a bear to remove.
