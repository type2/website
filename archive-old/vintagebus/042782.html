&gt; I am hearing a low, clunky rattle from the front end when driving; it
&gt; SOUNDS like it might be the ball joints, but they are newish (&lt;8K).

Check your shock bolts...

If one comes loose but not out, it can make a heck of a racket. The sound
you describe is pretty much what i heard when I had one of my rear shocks
loosen up a tad on my 71, drove me nuts for a couple of weeks until i
figured it out.  It was hard to tell exactly where the noise was coming
from, so check all 4 shocks (8 bolts/nuts)

take care,

Steve
