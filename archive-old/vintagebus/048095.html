today. Hot here  in Oly WA, at least for us, 92. After bus is on freeway, 
pressure goes way down. Light comes on at idle, guage reads like 2 to 3 psi. 
Even at speed its like 10 to 15 psi.  &gt;&gt;

Hi Jason,
What RPMS are you using for cruising?  We have had the same problems by going 
way over 3,000 RPM and even on really hot days climbing hills have had to 
drop down to 2,800 RPM to keep it below 220F.
Check you fan width which must be at least 33mm (35mm is better.) inside 
measurement and the lower pulley a 2:1 ratio both especially a must for use 
with doghouse shroud!  Check for relief and regulator spring proper lengths.  
Make sure your idle and main jets are not too small or the air correction jet 
too big any of which will cause it to run too lean.  Do you have all the 
engine tin and seals including the seals for the doghouse system?  Is your 
thermostatic flaps system operating??  Occasionally the arced arm of the 
right hand flaps that the upper end of the rod to the thermostat goes into 
can have been bent up too much by a heavy handed mechanic who shoved down the 
shroud into place instead of carefully feeding the thermostaic rod through 
the head.  Also could be this rod has been fed through the wrong hole in the 
head causing it to bind.
  We have gone to the type 4 cooler in the doghouse shroud and have seen 
about a ten degree drop in and much more stabile oil temps at 2,800-3,000 RPM 
in hot weather.  This cooler may not add much more oil capacity to the 
engine, but adds 40% more surface area for the cooling air to cool and even 
more importantly 40% more surface area internally for the oil to contact and 
cool.  With 40% more tubing the oil should slow down about the same amount on 
it's way through the cooler giving it 40% more time to rid itself of heat.
There is a type 3 cooler that has more fins to it than the later doghouse 
cooler.  They both have the same amount of tubes through them so there is no 
differance in internal surface area for the oil to slide up against and loose 
it's heat.  We have wondered why VW gave up on this type 3 cooler when they 
came out with the doghouse system for the upright engine in 1971.  They 
should have had had the tooling availible since the type 3 cooler came out 
much earlier than 1971.  Our guess is that the tighter finning caused the 
cooling air to have more problems going through it.  When cooling air removes 
heat it must expand.  Too much heat to remove and/or too tight an area to 
pass through and the amount of air you can push through it gets to be less 
and less.  Making the cooler less and less effective.
