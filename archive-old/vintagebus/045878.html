&gt;&gt;Hey all, 
RE: '59 Kombi, 1600 DP engine, recently overhauled, about 3000 miles on the

Hi Rex,
Did the rebuilder install new valves or the old ones just reground?  Either 
way it sounds like you are running too hot!  This will soften the steel valve 
stems and they will stretch like warm taffy, especially in # 3 cylinder.  
What kind of outside temps are you encountering and what RPMs are you 
cruising at?  You might want to just buy new heads that have been Unleaded 
converted (Thicker exhaust stems!) from Butch in San Diego.   Eric&amp;Barb
