 Now with the 67 bignut, the 3-4 shift is a bear! i think my 1600 DP with
 extractor will be getting a bus muffler for more low end torque...
 
 first gear is useable for more than just getting moving, the mall nut
 first gear with a 1600 was almost useless, you had to shift almost
 immediately, i found that annoying.
 
 My starter now turns like crazy because i have both the 67 and 61 ground
 strap in place. (67 goes from front tranny mount to transaxle case, 61
 goes from rear tranny mount to starter bolt) I wouldnt doubt if half the
 starter problems in old busses are from bad or missing ground straps...
 
 A friend (brian) has had poor engine power problems since a tranny swap, i
 was thinking he ought to check his ground straps for good connections as
 the tranny ground strap grounds the engine, if this isnt there or is poor
 the engine ignition etc will get poor electrical power, and could cause
 problems... as the engine/tranny is fully insulated from the chassis other
 than this(these) strap(s).
  &gt;&gt;

if the new tranny was geared much higher it can make the engine seem tired.  
Then again you can swap a 'tired' motor into a bug or a bus with low gearing 
and suddenly have loads of zip.   that low gearing was designed for little 
motors.   my barndoor is zippy with a 36hp.  If I throw the 36hp into my 
camper with a 3.88r&amp;p/1.26rgs instead of the 4.43r&amp;p/1.40rgs it'll suddenly 
be &quot;tired&quot;

oh- but you mean power as in electricity-  did he even put a ground strap on 
the tranny?
