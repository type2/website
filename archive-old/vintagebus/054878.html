Subject: Re: [VB] sundial vs westy

Hi David, you probably did not read the previosu
threads.  Some one had asked why Westys had that darn
window in the closet?  When their Sundial did not.  I
just addressed that question of what that darn window
was there.  

I think you misunderstood what i was speaking of.

Thanks

&gt; &gt; Westfalia was held to far stricter rules and
&gt; safety
&gt; &gt; regulations.  This addresses the &quot;window in the
&gt; &gt; closet..&quot; complaint.  Westfalia campers were
&gt; always
&gt; 
&gt; Ok...I have to ask something here.
&gt; 
&gt; Where, and when, was this complaint addressed?? :) 
&gt; My '66 so-44 has a
&gt; /popout/ window factory-installed in the closet.  My
&gt; old so-67 '69 Had a
&gt; window in the closet, albeit covered.
&gt; 
&gt; My 75 deluxe westy did not, though..But its closet
&gt; forced the spare onto
&gt; the nose.
&gt; 
&gt; Moms 82 Vanagon Deluxe Westy ALSO has a window in
&gt; the closet, if memory
&gt; serves....at least, I recall many many vanagon
&gt; owners complaining about
&gt; the closet being in the way of tinting that
&gt; window...I dont use moms
&gt; closet, so my memory isnt fresh...even if I did put
&gt; a transmission in it
&gt; sunday. :)
&gt; 
&gt; I also seem to recall all of the so-42 campers that
&gt; I can think of /also/
&gt; having a window in the closet....
&gt; 
&gt; So, again, what is the issue that they addressed? 
&gt; Was it a /lack/ of
&gt; window issue, so they added it??
&gt; 
&gt;
