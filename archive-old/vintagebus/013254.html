At Kelly Park,  I overheard the guy from Wolfgang telling someone this,
and how his were better.  Of course the guy didn't say how the
Wolfgang ones are so strong that the frames will crack in a couple 
months, and the poweder coating will rust thru at the first rain...

&gt; I had been hearing about his channels not being strong enuff and that the
&gt; glass was cracking. He denied all of it and said he had had no reports from
&gt; ANYONE ( even though several ppl on here told me they had contacted him and
&gt; told him) and that everyone was happy with his product and that they dont
&gt; crack........*Sigh*
