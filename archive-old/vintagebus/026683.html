Subject: FWD Door Needed 64-67 Driver's side ( Oregon or shipable distance)

Dearest Listees,

This is from a split window driver notorious in my area for bringing
back lost causes and making them nice buses. Can anyonehelp him? 
He mentioned maybe having an earlier pull-handle door to trade....or
cash. He is in Corvallis, Oregon

 &gt;&gt; Jack,

       Thanks for the response. If you're willing to post my
request to the
vintagebus_dot_com list you have my permission . I'm after a 64-67
pass. side
front door in fair condition (it can't be straighter or less
rusty than the
rest of the truck you know!) . Talk to you later.

                                                        Thanks,
Joe H.
