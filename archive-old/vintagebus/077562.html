Subject: Re: [VB] 241 walk through

For what it's worth, I have a '63 15 window.  Here are the M-Codes:

- 424 - unknown, package?
- 081 - walk-through cab (microbus and deluxe - LHD)
- 114 - six opening side windows (export)
- 130 - microbus deluxe without sliding roof or roof windows

This Bus will not take a 2/3 middle bench - it lacks the necessary holes 
in both of the middle hold down plates that are welded to the floor 
(plates are there - no holes).  Plus, the original rubber mat does not 
have holes for a 2/3 bench's passenger side mounts.

I have had several people try to tell me that something is wrong with my 
Bus, that ALL walk-throughs came with 2/3 middle benches so you could 
move around the entire interior without getting out.  Well, they're 
wrong about that.  It's obvious to me that the Bus has never been 
modified.  This has been a curiosity of mine for a while, though.

I love the variety we find in these old Busses!
