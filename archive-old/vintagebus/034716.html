&lt;&lt; i just traded a 1835 for a PORSCHE 356 B engine that i'm going to put in my
 1966 hardtop walkthrough delux, can't wait to cruise at 4 g's rpm, and to
 top it off all the external parts of the engine are chrome and it runs like
 a top, beats putting in the SUPER 90 engine (fresh) that i was thinking of
 putting in! &gt;&gt;


ronnie,

That's kind of ironic! I took a tired Porsche motor out of my 356 a while 
back and replaced it with a VW 1835. Unless you have a Carrier motor, the 
highest rated 356 motor was 90HP. My 1835 was close to that and much cheaper 
and easier to fix. I recently pulled it and stoked it to 1955cc with a nice 
counterweighted and balanced crank and a new set of Weber 44IDF's. It will 
run 5g's all day!  I'm the envy of all my 356 buddies! I decided to build the 
same motor for my '67 Bus and a higher tuned version for my '73 street rod 
Thing. 

Those old Porsche motors are too expensive to build and maintain. Besides up 
to 1954 Porsche was supplied by VW anyway, so the lines are a bit blurred 
during that period of time. Also with the VW 1955cc motor in the Bus, the 
Vintage Nazi's will be knocking on your door before mine !!
