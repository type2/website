Hi Volks,
Best to change the oil first since it most likely was run in the engine five 
years ago.  Once you run the engine with new oil even only five minutes the 
oil breakdown process starts.  We have two very early engine cases which have 
corroded through the sump area due to acidic oil left in them.  Not good!
  Definitely drive it only around town for the firt 300 miles only driving a 
half hour at a time with fifteen minutes minimum between trips to allow the 
engine to cool during this rebreakin period which lots of friction will occur 
causing lots of heat which in turn will let loose all the gunk in the engine 
all of the sudden.  Probably a good idea to change engine oil at least every 
50 miles during the first 300 miles to slowly remove all the gunk in it or 
risk clogging up the oil cooler.  BTDT!
