&gt;    There here, after weeks of waiting 2 new buses appeared at my home on
&gt; Sunday while I was at Pomona, a 1960 15 window Deluxe and a ???? 21 window
&gt; Deluxe. They were supposed to be delivered on Friday morning before I left
&gt; on my weekend VW show adventure, but that wasn't going to happen, I waited
&gt; till 1 pm for a phone call, but none so off I went. It was a very fun
&gt; weekend and the excitment kept building as I would recieve phone calls as
to
&gt; the whereabouts of these buses. Then the call came, THERE HERE, 9 am
Sunday
&gt; moring. I wnted to pack up and leave Pomona to get home to check them out,
&gt; but decided what's another few hours after waiting since JUNE to get them.
&gt; The 1960 15 window is MINE, to go in my collection of 1060's era buses, 60
&gt; DD ( to be converted to a 58 look), 1960 DC (100% rust free) Whored Viper
&gt; Red look (who needs stock), and my 1960 Westy (will be stock). All I need
is
&gt; a 60 single cab and a high roof to complete the colection
&gt;
&gt; ronnie
&gt;
&gt; ps, the 21 window isn't mine, I don't like the extra windows and the rag
top
