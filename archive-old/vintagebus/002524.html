  OK, so I gotta go to a Lioness Club dinner on June 10th.
(we're talkin' Full suit-n-tie, Aghhhhhh) :(  Mind you it's 110*
outdoors know-a-days.  I gets this call last from Terry Delaney
on how he wants me to go with him to OCTO, hmm. BTW
Terry drives a '51 23 window, yes a 51!!! Oh but gee I can't go
Terry :(  The wife overhears and says &quot;why don't you go?&quot; ;&gt;)
Well honey I was looking forward to the dinner ( YEA RIGHT).
SEE YA AT OCTO!
