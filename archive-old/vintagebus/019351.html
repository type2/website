Subject: '55 SC - Sitting too low...

I went to put some &quot;new&quot; tires on the '55 yesterday, and found an
ugly surprise: on the passenger side, one of the torsion springs
had herniated, and was sticking out of the trailing arm (maybe it
was just happy to see me!)

So I pulled the springs out - what was left of them.  The lower set
were split right in the middle, the uppper set had 3 leaves
intact.
