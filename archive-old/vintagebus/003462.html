I believe the gap in the heater boxes that the article was referring to is
the one up on the flap assembly, which dumps air out towards the head when
the exchanger flap is closed.

I wouldn't worry much about having those gaps at the ends of the pipes
sealed up.  I bet they're too small to offer effective cooling when the
exchanger is closed.  I've been sealing up those gaps with RTV for years,
and never had any such &quot;meltdown&quot; problems with my heat exchangers.

What to say to somebody who doesn't appreciate your Vintage VW: &quot;In ten
years
my car will still be a classic, your will just be OLD.&quot;

Protect me from the things I want.    Leave now, sleep when you get there.
