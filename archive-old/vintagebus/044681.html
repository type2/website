&lt;&lt;Just curious... what is OJT? ...hopefully this is some technical machinist's
term and not a bit of net jargon that I have somehow missed ;)
good post... too many people take bearing/journal sizes for granted. &gt;&gt;
Hi Jason,
OJT = On Job Training.  In otherwords the employ gets to use your VW, part, 
or other as a learning tool.  Which means there probably will be a learning 
curve of mistakes.  Resulting with you possibly having a bad experience now 
or a little down the road due to this!
