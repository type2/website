Subject: Site for VW to Porsche engine swap

I am wondering if there is a good website around that has information on a switch from VW power to Porsche in a splittie?

The only thing I have seen is for a 74 or 75 bay to 911 2.2L power.  The site is okay but not that technical and it does not reference anything other than the type 4 VW power conversion.  Granted it was a slick engine swap. 

I have seen this junk in the VW rags, but never in detail.  The probability of me actually doing this is low, but if I can score a 911 motor cheap I may try it.  Maybe after all that work I will get my brake lights fixed too... So I can actually put it on the road.

  
Thanks,
