&gt; This &quot;barn door&quot; crew has had me wondering.  I thought the Binz were first
&gt; made in '58.

It is my understanding that Binz began converting singlecabs in '53 and
continued on past when VW began making them in 59. As '58 was the year they
were marketed through the dealerships it is obviously the most common year
to see. I have seen pictures of a '60 or '61 Binz all painted in commercial
signage somewhere on the net, although I don't remember where. If I am
recalling right, the Binz doublecab conversion was available as a special
order model through VW dealers earlier than '58 as well as you being able to
take in your own vehicle and have it done. I have read something fairly
recently about the earlier Binz's, maybe in the 50 years of the bus book?
