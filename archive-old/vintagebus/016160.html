I've seen several single cabs modified this way.  The Corvair
Greenbriar pickups were like this from the factory, and it's an
attempt to duplicate that functionality.  One complaint about the 
single cab was that the bed was so high.

&gt; 
&gt; This is a Single Cab where the toolchest door and the front 1/2 of a side gate were merged into a door that folded down, similar to the rear of an Ambulance Bus.  The front 1/2 of the bed was also cut out.
