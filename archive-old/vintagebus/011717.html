Well I picked up another 68 today  and it needs some work on the tranny I
think... What happens is when you try to start it the motor tries to turn
over but it sounds like the tranny is jammed into gear...And if you push
down on the clutch it forces your foot up when you try to start it....I
am almost positive the engine is not seized...Ive read a little on the
tranny but not in depth...Could it be the clutch plate...Any help
appreciated. Also I have a spare tranny from a 70 I got...these are
swappable correct?...Thanks again.


Greg
