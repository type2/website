Subject: [VB] what RPM at 60MPH

My '67 has 14&quot; 205 radials.  I have checked the speedo with a GPS reciever.
It was pretty close.

How accurage at chaper tachometers in general?  I can hook my my Sears
tach/dwell meter to the signal and see if it gets same reading... but I'm
assuming cheap electronic tachs are general pretty accurate at these under
5000 readings.  Bad assumption?

I have stock redux boxes for '67 and unknown tranny.

I know I am sure going a lot more than 3800RPM at 60.  And you are talking
the 1.39 redux, I'm on the 1.25... so I should be lower, not higher, right?
Or does the 14&quot; / 15&quot; tire difference (1963 and earlier) factor that much?

freeway cruise


..some folks in this thread has been running quite hi
mph compared to RPM ratios in stock tranny
applications.  These readings seem all over the board.
I am wondering has anyone compare there speedo reading
to 'actual' speed via other means.  This maybe due to
using smaller then stock, radial tires in the place of
correct monsterous height bias plys?  

My speedo is dead on the nose correct with 6:40-15&quot;s
bias plys and is exactly 5 mph too fast with 195-75's.
 We have those neat little police set up MPH stands in
Ohio that warn you of your speed.  Cool for checking
out your actual bus speed!

My `61's rpms are 3600 _at_ 60mph with the bias ply
6:40-15's.  Exactly what my `61 brochure says it
should. With the 195-75 radials I run 3800 at 60 mph
(actual speed) and the speedo reads 65mph.
