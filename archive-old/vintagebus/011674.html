If anybody is interested, there is a show in Coquitlam, BC on Sunday.  
That's about 1/2 hour from Vancouver.  I'm not sure of all the details, 
but I do know it's usually a pretty big show, with a decent swap meet 
(all you Americans, your money's worth double up here!)  It's at Town 
Center Park, on Pinetree Way.  If anybody wants to come up there's 
plenty of bus parking in my yard.  Give me a call 604-215-4662, since I 
won't check my mail again until next week.
Diana
'66 bus, getting welded Sat. morning!
