&lt;&lt;  What is &quot;time-sert&quot; and how do you do it?  Also, what size insert do you 
use when repairing these stripped holes? &gt;&gt;
Hi Jon,
Try taking a look at them at:  http://www.timesert_dot_com/   ,and check out 
Metric Fasteners.  Plus they have kits, and inserts to do the spark plug 
holes in your heads!  So if you want to repair them or if you are rebuilding 
your heads just prevent the aluminuim threads in the heads from giving you 
problems down the road....
  Like we said in our previous e-mail make sure to order both the repair kit 
part # 1215 for 12 x 1.5mm thread.  This kit only come with 4 or 6 very short 
length inserts.  Then order plenty of 30mm long inserts part # 12159.  Then 
get the longer (About 40mm) bolts!    
  So far with just the longer bolts and/or the other holes solid inserted all 
of our stripped thread problems there are long gone!  This is especially 
important if you plan to use 1964-67 reductions with the plug on the inside 
being the only way to replace the lower inner axle bearing.  Which means you 
have to remove the reduction box from the swing plate all too more often than 
the 1950-63 styles!    Eric&amp;Barb
