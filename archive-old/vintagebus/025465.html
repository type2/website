Peter, get the trim repaired professionally but you can easily polish it
yourself. You will need access to a bench grinder, a variety of mops
suitable for the grinder to deal with scratches and polishing and you
should use the aluminium polish that comes in a bar to load the mops.
Liquid polish by hand will take forever and will not remove scratches
but will help maintain the appearance once finished. You can do it all
but for the long side moulding a helping hand that is patient will be
necessary.
