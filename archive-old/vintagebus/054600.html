&gt;Subject: [VB] Westy rear seat
&gt;Date: Tue, 30 Oct 2001 16:37:24 EST
&gt;
&gt;Hey guys, this is my first posting in about a year, on and off working on 
&gt;my
&gt;bus. I have a standard '58, and i bought a rear seat from a '68 westy
&gt;walkthrough. Trouble is  I have no idea how to put it in my bus. The bolts 
&gt;on
&gt;bottom line up, but i can't figure out which way the hinges are supposed to
&gt;face, or if it will even fit at all. Can anyone tell me that it is no use
&gt;trying, or send me some pics of an installed seat that can help me?!
&gt;                                                                    Thanks 
&gt;for
&gt;any help!!!
