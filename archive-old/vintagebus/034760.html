&lt;&lt; Dear List,
 I purchased the bus/bug/trailer combo at a Western Michigan Wal-mart,
 and paid $17.95 for it.  I had mentioned to another list member about
 the great range in pricing in different parts of the country.
 Has anyone else paid this much?

I can definitely say it is not a 17.95 toy, wait for the hype to slow down 
and then get one later, no big loss.
Mike
