&gt; Jack,
 
&gt; You are flirting with over-reving. 

No kidding. That was my point.
I have done this twice. for less than a minute at a time. I normally
cruise 60-65. Once in a while I'll hit 70-75 for a short couple minute
burst when everything feels right. 
My point was that with an empty bus and a 1600dp, you CAN over-rev, even
with stock intake and exhaust. Although a 34mm dp intake is not the same
as a 28mm single.....
