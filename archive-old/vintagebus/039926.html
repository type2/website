&gt;I can't find any reference to Manson and a VW bus. He had a beetle and 
&gt;planned to roam a post-revolution America in dune buggies. Guess I'll have 
&gt;to plumb the depths of Futurama Fandom to discover or chastize.
&gt;

And here you are: (its late friday OK?)

FROM:

61 Cal.App.3d 102 132 Cal.Rptr. 265 (Cite as: 61 Cal.App.3d 102)

THE PEOPLE, Plaintiff and Respondent, v. CHARLES MANSON et al., Defendants 
and Appellants

Crim. Nos. 22239, 24376.

Court of Appeal, Second District, Divison 1, California.

August 13, 1976.


(excerpt)


Sometime in 1967 Manson found his way to the Haight-Ashbury district of San 
Francisco. While there he became associated with young girls and women who 
were runaways, drop outs or otherwise disassociated with conventional 
society. He obtained a Volkswagen bus, collected some of his female 
companions, and began traveling about the country.

Hows That?
