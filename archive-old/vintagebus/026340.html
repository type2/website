&gt; *does any one else have a better technique?  (I haven't tried the vibrating
&gt; sander for steps 1 &amp; 2 yet, and I may)

Why not use a stationary buffer with progressively finer grades of buffing compound
and wheels?  Its what the pros use.

&gt;
&gt;
&gt; *Does anyone know if there is anything I can spray / brush on to prolong me
&gt; having to do this again? (I've heard of a clear powder paint for this, but have
&gt; never seen results or have heard of long term effects - any comments?)
&gt;
&gt; *Does anyone recommend any product that will allow me to repolish the trim on
&gt; the bus, meaning Its taken me two years to actually complete polishing all of
&gt; the trim (newborn son factor)  and now that I'm actually done the piece I worked
&gt; two years ago has slightly dulled.  I don't want to take it off to re-polish.
&gt; Any suggestions?

POR15 makes a product called &quot;Plucid&quot;.  Basically clear POR15.  Its been mentioned
on the list.  Supposed to be great stuff.  Brush or spray.  If you do it right, you
shouldn't need to re-polish for a long, long time.
