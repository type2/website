On the Kombi I was only able to install the uppermost and lowermost clips.
It looks fine and is secure, if I ever have to replace the ol' wiper motor,
or otherwise do major disassembly back there, I'll put on the other ones :-)
Without being a contortionist, I doubt it's very easy to put all four on
with all that stuff crammed in there!

Plus I guess if someone steals it, it'll come off even *easier* than with
the four clips, so maybe they'll be grateful and leave the other stuff alone
:-)

&gt; Can someone tell me how in the heck you can secure your front emblem back
on
&gt; the nose of your bus. I have only been able to get 1 lock tab right lower.
&gt; The others for get about it! behind the fuse box, behind the wiper motor,
the
&gt; fourth???
