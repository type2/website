Subject: Iron Cross emblem / lowering light bulbs

For all the listees that have emailed me about the emblem. I will post
here when I have them with pictures, price, etc. I wasn't planning on
selling any, just having a few for myself, guess I'll have to rethink
that as well.

I'll keep everyone &quot;posted&quot;

Greg &quot;not lowering the wattage of the light bulbs, but body dropping
them. That way they look lower but still perform as originally designed&quot;
