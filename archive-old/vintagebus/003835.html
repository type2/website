I'm looking for personal opinions about Bernie's welded counterweighted
stroker cranks.  Recent opinions since he got the new grinder a year+ or so
ago.

I'm particularly looking at about a 74-75mm stroke T4 but would like
opinions about any personal or near personal experiece with his products, as
the only near personal story I've heard was particularly BAD and I trust the
source but involves the product some years (5) ago.  The experience was weld
smearing off a welded rod journal in a fairly high performance but correctly
built T1 after about 15k miles.

Thing is Bernie looks about the only reasonably available source timewise
for something custom in a T4.  I had been prepared to deal with my queasy
feelings of uneasiness 6 months ago when his prices were still low but they
seem to have taken quite an increase lately, up to $390 and another $65 for
nitriding, which of course terrifies me and makes me wonder if the regular
ones receive any stress relief and heat treating period.  Anyway if I'm
actually going to sink half a grand into this crank I'm wanting opinions.  I
have dye penetrant at home and will look at the thing, measure, etc. upon
recieving, perhaps even try to get it in a magnuflux tank, but there isn't
any easy way I can tell to nondestructively inspect surface hardness so...

Anyway opinions from T1 or T4 crowd quite happily taken.

Any opinions appreciated, or other sources.  Also anyone knowing if as I
expect from my measurement a 75mm crank in the T4 case will clear the #2/#4
intake lobe of a mild performance (.300 or so at the cam) lift cam and the
upper crankcase without requiring rod clearancing.
