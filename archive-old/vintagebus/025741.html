YYYHEEEAAAA!!!!  right on Neil!

Plus there is still the fact that a 64-67 roof WON'T FIT on a pre-64 bus. and
vice-versa!!  The cornerws are TOTALLY DIFFERENT.



&gt;Think about this people.  the guy wants to cut the roof off of a 55 23 window

&gt;and put it on a 66.  why not use the 66 as a donor bus and cut as much usable

&gt;sheet metal out of it and fix the 55?  the 55 would end up being a cooler bus

&gt;with nicer bumpers, smaller hatch and at the very least a much better color

&gt;if painted back to stock.   
&gt;And dont tell me about rust (if thats why the 55 is unrestorable).  you all

&gt;can look at the metwiz's web page and check out my labor of love 58 15 
&gt;window.  I have owned that bus for over 10 years and have vowed to fix it at

&gt;any cost.  it is actually cheeper then you think if you do some of the work

&gt;yourself.  i think i would rather pull up a cargo floor anyday then to 
&gt;replace a roof clip.
