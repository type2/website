Well.....

The original damage was done by a painting contractor hired by the City of
Tacoma.  That crew sprayed an etching primer onto the structure of the 11th
Street Bridge, directly above one of the largest marinas in South Puget
Sound.  As no provision was made to confine the spray everything near or
underneath was also sprayed with etching primer, including dozens of parked
automobiles in addition to the moored boats.  Can you say &quot;Millionaire
contractors can be total idiots&quot;?  Before all was said and done the City
[self-insured] paid out several million dollars for repairs, damages, and
restitution.

The rigger's tools and the stainless fittings were dumped from the bow of a
moored cruiser due to the severe wake of a passing City fireboat, responding
to an emergency.

The rigger hired a diver to recover his tools and the stainless fittings
because time was critical and he didn't want to wait for the City to act.
The diver cost him $50.00.

The fittings being installed were machined and/or cast marine stainless
steel of the highest commercially available quality.  As it happened, the
Mayor and some other City officials were among the injured parties.  They
demanded first class replacements and repairs, and thus all claimants
similarly benefited.

The condition of the retrieved stainless steel fittings was thoroughly
documented.  This incident's documentation subsequently became public record
and was a factor in instigating a Federal study of the waterway.  Federally
funded cleanup has yet to begin [Hey, it's only been 16 years!].

And, for the record:

    I was present when the tools and parts were dumped.

    I was present when the diver retrieved the dumped items.

    I have testified in formal hearings as to the condition of the high
quality stainless steel items after ~48 hours immersion in the waters of our
fair city.

OBC:   Some of us in Tacoma/Pierce County have discussed the possibility of
using this particular waterway as a whole vehicle &quot;dip tank&quot; to clean and
prep our Buses for painting, exhibition, repair, etc.  The possibilities are
endless.....

&gt;&gt;  Fred, mentioning Delorean is a good example of how using the proper kind
does work...  Yet your city contractor example tells more about city
contractors and city management than stainless steel.  Having a diver
fetch from the water, I bet that was cost effective for what surely had to
be lowest-bid product.  And wasn't the contractor held responsible for the
accident?! (yes yes, I did read the expensive tools part...)  &lt;&lt;
