&gt;&gt; ... I used a Brazilian PICT30/31-3 Brosol with the
&gt;&gt;  included adapter on my Mexican engine in my '71 bus.  It worked fine from
&gt;&gt;  the get-go with a .009 distributor.
&gt;&gt;  It started, idled, and ran fine out of the box  Good drivability.
&gt;&gt;  The 34PICT flat spot is still there, but considerably reduced.
&gt;&gt;  OTOH, I notice that the engine has a greater flattening of power at high
&gt;&gt;  RPM than the old engine and 34PICT-3 that it replaced.  This is
&gt;&gt;  particularly noticable when climbing hills.  Situations where I used to
&gt;&gt;  hold 40MPH (actual) at partial throttle in third are now 37MPH (actual) at
&gt;&gt;  WOT.

&gt;&gt; Using an H30/31 carburetor on a dual port engine has produced a noticeable
&gt;&gt;  drop in hill climbing power for me.  I switched back to a 34pict3 and felt
&gt;&gt;  better going up hill with the pedal on the floor.  This was on a bug, but
&gt;&gt;  I climbed a big hill every day with it at freeway speeds.  The 30/31 carbs
&gt;&gt;  don't flow as much as a 34pict3.  If running dual port heads use a
&gt;&gt;  34pict3.  If running single ports use 30/31 in general.
&gt;
&gt;What about the power circuit in the 30 pict-2?  This carb was made for 1600
&gt;engines, albeit SP's.  The power circuit is supposed to compensate during
&gt;WOT. Sounds like folks are not happy with the 30 pict-1 on DP's.  I think I
&gt;am going to have a 30 pict-2 rebuilt to give it a try.


While perhaps not available as a new part, the 30PICT-3 carb (OEM on 1970
1600SP) has a high speed circuit, which is supposed to prevent lean-out
during prolonged high RPM running.  I once burned a nice round hole in the
center of a piston in a 1969 convertible (was running 85-90 mph when I lost
power and saw smoke behind me), so I think this extra curcuit may have some
value.
