Subject: RE: [VB] WTB - NOS mounts

Hey Mike, you and I are in the same boat.... I've been searching for about 3
months now for some nos or good used original rear tranny mounts.  I have
several sets of the current 'German' production but I really want ones that
have the VW symbol on them.  I was lucky enough to find a very nice mint
original front tranny mount in October at a swap (for 50 cents!).

I'd be glad to trade a brand new set of current German rear mounts for an
original pair (NOS or in nice shape) plus some cash.  I got my mounts from
Bob at BBT in Belgium.


Good luck.

David
