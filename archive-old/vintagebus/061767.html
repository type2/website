Subject: Re: [VB] Have Gauges, Will Question

&gt;First stop, the oil pressure relief valve.  Pulled plug and spring.  Plu=
nger
didn't fall right out, but didn't have to try the 10mm tap to pull it. 
A couple of turns with a screw driver and it fell out in my hot, oily han=
d.
 Quick check of specs led me to &quot;wrong spring.&quot;  Specs I have say 2.44&quot;
to 2.52&quot; length.  Mine was well over that.  Had two other springs in my
stash.  Found one meeting length spec and put it in.  
&gt;
2.44&quot;-2.52&quot; =3D 62-64 mm, which I think is the spec. for single-relief ca=
ses.

The engine I have with a dual relief case has a 73 mm uncompressed spring=

by the oil pump, 30 mm up front.  Whether these are right/wrong, I don't
know as I have not been able to find the dual relief spring specs that st=
ate
the uncompressed spring length.  It also has 2 solid plungers.  This is
a dealer/factory rebuilt engine, probably from the late 1970s.

At one point, this engine had the light begin to come on at idle, the fro=
nt
oil plunger was stuck in the downward position, which results in lower oi=
l
pressure all around.
