Subject: Re: [VB] Heads up 34 pict 3

We've been able to source German 34pict3's for the last year. The supply is
sporatic though, so we buy them whenever they become avaliable. We don't
know how long these will be avaliable either. Buy as many as we can,
whenever we can.

&gt;   I was just informed by one of my importers (when ordering) that the 34
&gt; pict 3's might become obsolete. There has allready been a substantal price
&gt; increase . This could be rumor or truth but checking with other importers
I
&gt; believe it's true as they have all raised there prices by 25% or more.  So
&gt; if you where thinking of a new carb I would hunt down the lowest price and
&gt; get one before the vendors catch up with the new pricing, I am currentley
&gt; selling thm on special order only as my current inventory of 34 pict 3 is
&gt; sold out (I had them priced to low I guess)
