Subject: Key Code Deciphering? (&lt;67)
Mime-Version: 1.0

Does anyone have an ability to decipher a &quot;L&quot; code (or is it &quot;F&quot;?) on the tumbler of a lock into somehting a lock smith could decipher?

I have a door lock that has the originalkey code number stamped in the  handle and I want to get a key cut for it. Does anyone have a book or whatever that takes these obscure codes and translates them into something that a locksmith could use to cut a key?

Oh btw it is for a 65' bus if that detail matters..

thanks

michael
