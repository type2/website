Hi Clara &amp; nfa lincoln,
The early 1964 bus used alot of earlier bus parts.  The exterior handles and
front doors of your bus were used in 1962-early 1964.  The main differance
between these parts and the even ealier parts used down to 1955 or so is the
area on the 1962-early 1964s where the exterior handle mounts in the front
door is that there is a recessed area that the base of the handles mounts.  If
you use the 1955-61 handles on your year doors they will constantly tap and
chip the paint on the door with thier front tips due to the recessed mounting
area of the front 1962-early 1964 doors which moves these handle more inward
than they were designed for.    Eric &amp; Barb
