I caution you to recognize that this is over 30 years old and there could be
many mods after it left the factory!

Clara / Todd / I can all attest to the fact that we have seen an axle where
a PO machined the center end ... we wasted more than 4 hours because we
didn't take the time to properly mark which axle was on which side.

How did you determine the 1.5&quot; difference?  Did you measure the length of
the axles?  are both sides identical?
