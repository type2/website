Subject: Bus Shades - Need replacement fabric - BYOB caravan from Central CA

The fabric on the Costco 10x20' shelter has been weakened by UV and torn by
storms. Does anyone have the site or phone number for the manufacturer
handy? Should be on the assembly instructions.  Bus content... I'll be
living in my bus if I don't get it fixed soon!

Tentatively, Karl and I will be leaving Fresno at noon on Friday. We'll be
on 152 mostly.  Another group will be leaving after 5 p.m. We'll be moving
fast, they'll be slower if anyone wants to join in.

    -Harry in Fresno
