&gt;    Also this bus has the coolest little stove that is behind the back
&gt;seat of the passengers front seat.  The front seat folds up flush to the
&gt;window and then the stove folds down and makes a broiler and a 2 burner
&gt;stove.  It also had a 3 piece wind screen and the back had compartments
&gt;for chairs that attacked over the storage area on little clamps

Anybody know the conversion that I am speaking of.  Is that the
&gt;original Doormobile?  Did they come with chairs and a chair compartment
&gt;over the engine?  Silverware storage compartments?  What is the stove
&gt;called?  It was way cool!
