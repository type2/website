Subject: 67 westy help
To: vintagebus_at_lenti.type2_dot_com

    Hello all. New subsciber to this list and the Vintage Bus scene. Just 
picked up a 67 Westy today and have had a 65 13 window deluxe parts bus for 
some time. I have fallen in love with the 67 and she is now my new project. I 
have lots of questions because I haven't messed with many busses other than 
my 72 westy. 
    I am trying to find out what the original camper equiptment should be in 
this 67. I like the stuff in my 72 and was kinda hoping most of it was stock 
for 67 as well, for that could save me some serious cash Im sure. 
    I have the center pop-top, but what is it for? I know the later models 
have either a cot or a bed up there, but there is no imaginable way someone 
could sleep up in this thing. Is it just so you have room to stand up? 
    Where is the best supplier for like the window seals and such and is it 
true that the 67 has a one year only master cylinder that is in the $200 
range?
    
    The body on this thing is near perfect, all in primer, but it is 
stripped. I have alot of parts like all the windows and such, but I do want 
to put it together right. I didn't get to tear into the chassis much, but I 
would like to work on that first. I have a 1500cc engine lined up for it, 
which I'm pretty sure is original, but I still have to doublecheck. I might 
try to find a dual port for it. I'm not too worried about keeping everything 
stock, but it will look stock. And it will be a two tone paint job. A good 
two tone paint job on a vintage bus has got to be one of the nicest looking 
things out there! I love it! Even more than my Mopar Lime Green Dune Buggy! 
    Anyway enough for now. Sorry to use so much bandwidth but I do have lots 
of questions! I can't wait to get started on this! Thanks in advance and Keep 
BUGN!
