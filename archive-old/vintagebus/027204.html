&lt;&lt;(just like it's easier
to bitch over the phone than it is in person)&gt;&gt;

You really think so??!! I ALWAYS prefer to bitch in person. I wanna see
the person and look 'em square in the eye. That is the main reason I try
always to order within what I call &quot;choking distance&quot;. Not that I am
really gonna choke anyone or that I think I am a bad dooood or anything.
. . it's just that I like doing things face to face.
