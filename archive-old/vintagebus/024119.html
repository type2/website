Subject: Second Annual WetWesties/Bus Pilots Reunion Info &amp; Links

Good evening all,

Just a reminder for the PNW listmembers.  The Second Annual
WetWesties/Bus Pilots Reunion is two weeks away. (September 25-27)

Come join us for a relaxing time swapping lies, meeting new (and old)
friends, going on the always exciting WetWesties exclusive &quot;Bus Tour&quot;
and generally just having a good time.

This event is held in a small state park in the Blue Mountains of
Eastern Oregon. (Centrally located between Idaho listees and
Oregon/Washington listees.)  For Oregon Parks and Recreation
Department's description of the campground try:

(Note that we historically have taken all the sites beyond the east
loop. Two buses to a site seems to work well.)

Hope to see you there!
