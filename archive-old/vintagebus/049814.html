Subject: Re: [VB] automatic, automatic choke

&gt;During the ol' warm-it-up, as my engine warms and the revs start climb, just
&gt;at the point where you would tap the gas pedal to bring the choke down a
&gt;step, it does so by itself. I guess when the rpms get high enough, the
&gt;vibrations of the stepped cam thing hit the right frequency and the throttle
&gt;arm jumps down a notch or two. Works every time.
&gt;
&gt;I've never had a carb do this before, but this one (30 PICT-1) has done it
&gt;since I bought it new two years ago. I'm assuming this is just a bit of
&gt;&quot;personality&quot; and not designed into it.
&gt;
&gt;It's perfect for those times when you have to go back into the house for
&gt;something while the engine's warming up. There's no need to panic and start
&gt;running for the bus when you hear the engine start to scream. I just drops
&gt;down to a nice idle by itself.


They are supposed to step down by themselves.  I remember that the new ones
did, though maybe thay don't do it well on most of the old stuff we're used
to.  Since you have a new carb, it's working.  There's nothing to 'force'
the choke cam to rotate to the next step, but if you look at it you'll see
that the side opposite to the steps has a large round shape, just like the
counterweights on a 'full circle' crankshaft.  This causes gravity to
rotate the cam in the direction of the next lower step.  The vibration of
the engine, or blipping the throttle, allows the cam to rotate.
