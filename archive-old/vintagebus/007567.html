and that's exactly what I just noticed today. I'm selling things I don't
need and then on the other hand I keep buying new VW parts. So it goes in
circles. Sometimes I think that one day, some time later I might just need
the parts I sell today but then what the heck, there might be someone out
there that needs it right now!


All we do is exchange parts between us. Who else will buy these if not us?
Do you think that an SUV owner will be buying Bus parts? It's different
though when you see someone buying a Bus and then stripping and selling
individual parts since he can get more douh this way. This is crazy. What do
you do with the stripped shell? Junk yard?

&gt; &gt; The NOS swivel seat up on eBay right now.  I think it's Greg's at
Vintage Warehouse.  I have a sneaking suspicion as to why he's probably
selling it.  One, we all saw the swivel seat a few weeks ago sell for big
bucks, but more imprtantly, two, he's getting ready to buy a RHD Barndoor.
So, yes, he's trying to sell it for as much as he can, but at least he's
reinvesting back into the VW community.  (this is only speculation with
Greg, sorry if I'm wrong)
&gt;
&gt; This is *somewhat* true. I actually offered the seat up to &quot;the list&quot;
weeks BEFORE I saw one on eBay. No one bit, and my asking price was and
still is less than the used one went for. After a few posts about the
&quot;other&quot; seat I again let &quot;the list&quot; know I had one for less. Still no
takers..............Ebay it, to get rid of it!!
&gt;
&gt; Yeah I'm gonna step up and buy the RHD BD, and I'm sure I'll need some
pieces for it here and there. I'll probably find them on eBay, I too spend
the majority of my eBay money (probably more) buying other VW parts and
cars. It works for me and I'm not complaining.
