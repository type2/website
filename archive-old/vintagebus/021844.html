&gt; Just curious what other genetic mutations everyone else has seen.


There is an early 60's kombi with a beetle, from the window line up, grafted
onto its roof that has been knocking around a city nearby me called Pretoria
since the seventies. This thing is super ugly and must be a menace in the
roadholding department due to its heavily modified centre of gravity. While
it certainly isn't pretty the body work has been very well done and when I
saw the bus last it was being driven daily. There were no cracks that I
could see - pity the builder didn't put his talents to better use.

It was originally Frankensteined by or for an LSD soaked band called Band of
Gypsys(cheesy name, cheesy music) who were an awfull lot less memorable than
their wacky transportation.
