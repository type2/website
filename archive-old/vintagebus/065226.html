Subject: Re: [VB] turbo vs. street screamer

First off, I'm not trying to be a wet blanket.

Aub, you *really* need to sit down with pen and paper
and do some math.  You can't *assume* that a 'low comrpession'
turbocharged 1641 has the same heat issues as a 'punched out'
2L.  You just can't.

What you need to figure out is what kind of flow your candidate
turbocharger puts out, and how much of that you want to use.
In addition, you need to figure yoru target compression ratio.  A
lower CR will allow you to run more boost, but will be slower
off the line.  A higher CR will give you more off-the-line oomph,
and less lag, but will limit the amount of boost you can run.

Somewhere out there, someone has done the math of CR + displacement
+ boost = heat.  A quick search on google turned up 
http://www.turbofast_dot_com.au/javacalc.html - but there's a lot more.

Your biggest problem will be how to dissipate the heat, and ACVW
engines don't like huge amounts of heat.  The most successful air-cooled
street turbos are the Porsche 930 and 965 - look them up on the
web and search for hints.  Me, personally, would run a very large oil
pump and very large external cooler, instead of the engine-mounted cooler.
This would give the P/C's and heads all of the capacity of the fan.

You'll also need to think about plumbing oil to the turbo.

Turbocharged buses are doable, but not my style.  There's a guy locally
with a turbocharged barndoor, that can keep up with my 911 up to
about 75MPH or so, at which point aerodynamics take over.
