&gt;This where I read about it:
&gt; http://www.pelicanparts_dot_com/914/How_to_buy_a_914.htm

This site is blowing more smoke about ''carb'' cams then an engine with no
rings! In the US 914's just carried the Porsche name. In Europe they were
VW's.....
If you scroll down to ''things that may indicate trouble'' they say all
914's were injected. OK. Now if you go to VW and ask for a 0 gear cam for a
73 1700 bus WHICH came with 2 carbs you will get a 021 109 021L. Now if you
ask for a cam for a 77  bus which came with a 2.0L FI engine you will get a
021 109 021L cam. Where does Pelican get the fish story that '' Replacing
the fuel injection on an engine with a carb cam inside will not make the car
pass the smog test''???
Sorry, but I don't buy it.

&gt; Also look at the WebCam offerings here that differentiate between FI and
&gt; carb:
&gt; http://www.pelicanparts_dot_com/catalog/shopcart/9144/por_9144_engine_main.htm

Sure, but now they are talking aftermarket.  Lets keep apples with apples.

&gt; Boston Bob did not have anything on his page specific to this issue, but
&gt; then again his articles are somewhat slim in the technical speak if you
ask
&gt; me.
&gt; http://www.bostonengine_dot_com/articles/chaft.html

Well, he kind of did when he said &quot;There are also two different lift
camshafts in hydraulic engines....anywhere from 240 lift to 290 lift'' I
wish he gave part numbers because VW only supplied one cam, 022 109 021A and
it came with a 0 gear only. Then he goes on to say ''the stock Web Cam
hydraulic cams come in at 270 lift, which is a good compromise''
If ''stock'' is 240 or 290 why does Web Cam say their cam is ''stock''? If
you are compromising, then you are comparing apples to oranges.....


&gt; The bus is geared so low that I am sure that the WebCam WCAM-152 would
make
&gt; a great choice.
&gt;
&gt; Also I would reference the Wilson book for VW cam PN#s to see the
different
&gt; cams that were built for the Type 4.

The difference is the cam GEAR, the camshafts are the same. The gear will be
0, or -1, or -2, or -3.
