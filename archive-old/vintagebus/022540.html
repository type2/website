Cool.

&gt;What's involved in switching out the split-case tranny with another new
&gt;one? Will it swap right out, or do I have to replace the whole rear-end
&gt;redux boxes and all?

There is an adapted you can get from busboys/wolfgang, which will do the
adaptation.  All you need to bring to the table is your new tranny *and* a
bus nose cone.  These nosecones are available new now, BUT, and a roseanne
arnold kinda but, YOU CAN'T USE a nosecone with a reverse switch.  I found
out the hard way.  If I'd read the instructions that came with the adapter,
I'da found that out... I ground off the mount, and epoxied in a plug.

I'll take your old tranny.  I need the parts.
