Rex,
 Before you drive too far, check the check-valve in your carbs. Your electric fuel pump should STOP when the carb float(s) are full. Running too much fuel into the engine washes the oil off your cylinders and the rings will wear too fast and compression will go away. Just helped a buddy push an old beetle around his property and despite two low tires it pushed easily, but with a huff, huff, huff coming from the rear end. &quot;&amp;$#)(#_at_#$, is this in gear?&quot;

Sew, have we seen the end of the hemp thread? More woof and less warp? 

Did everyone get enough guajalote? Say wah-ha-low-tay, then look it up. 

Karl and I are ready for the Clovis, CA Christmas parade this Friday. P-mail for details. Got 12vdc-110vac inverters, mine was a Target special, $44 for a nice 400w unit with over/under voltage protection, fan, lighter and clamp connections, two 110vac outlets.  Handles a 150 light mesh strand and a 150 light twinkle type, no problem. Will try to get pics for your holiday wallpaper needs.
