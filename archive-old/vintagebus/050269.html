Subject: Re: [VB] More work on the 67 Deluxe...

&gt;I'm really kind of torn between parting the 66 out and hanging on to it

There's really nothing wrong with using 2 busses to make one good one. At
least then one of 'em gets to live on rather than 2 not making the long
haul. Sometimes you've gotta just do it.

If I were you, I'd get everything I needed from both to make the '67 (the
better candidate for resto 'cause of no rust) as good as it can be. From
there...2 options. Pull EVERYTHING that's left on the '66 off and save for
the future when you might need for the '67...or the better solution, make
the '66 a beater bus. I'm more than sure there will be times when your '67
will not be running 'cause it needs work. Then you'll have the '66, with
all the leftover parts on it to drive.

I seem to remember you having a bug, so maybe you don't need the extra
wheels. How about selling the '66 to one of the many people who are
&quot;looking for a '67 or earlier split window vw bus&quot;. Give 'em a good deal on
it to keep your karma good, make a little cash as a donation to the '67
(which goes back to the 2 making one good bus), and let them work on
bringing the '66 back to life.

Just some ideas.
