Hi Todd,
Sounds like a good deal for you.  Plus like you say you have the '60 is in
better shape anyway.  We bought our '52 sunroof from Bill Derriex and it
needed quite a few parts and has a nasty dent in the passenger quarter panel
just behind the door.  Looks like either a motorcycle doing a wheelie or a
high truck bed corner hit it above the heater channel and below the rear
quarter window.  Thank goodness we previously collected some oval window
pre-1956 bug body parts.  Other than the rear oval window they are pretty much
the same as the split window bodies.  Eric &amp; Barb
