Hi Steve,
First you must check all of the spindle parts for wear, and tear.  Then 
grease everything, and adjust toe in if needed.  Then adjust the drag link so 
the wheels are pointed forward when the steering box is centered at a point 
from equal amounts of turns from full left, and right position.   Eric&amp;Barb
