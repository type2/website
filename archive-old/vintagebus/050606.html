Subject: 4-59 date code F&amp;S shocks

Hi All,

I'm looking for an original pair of Fictel &amp; Sachs shocks for my 59 double
cab.  They don't need to be in working order... they just need nice bodies.
I'll rebuild them.  I do have a pair of them that were og to my bus with a
date code of 4-59.  So, if you have a 59 bus or an old pile of shocks,
please check them out.   I'm most interested in another pair dated 4-59 and
willing to pay for them or trade for a new pair of boge shocks... heck maybe
I could just have Ronnie drop ship a pair (or four?) to you?  If you have a
pair, you be the judge of how much they are worth.... most people throw them
out for obvious reason.  I'm stupid and willing to buy them!


TIA

David
