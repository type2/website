Clara has expressed concern that my free way flier trans might not be what
it says it was. Sort of a post back to her and to others.

Accorinding to the reciepts with the bus the hope is that the tranny was
identical to a later model (68-71) tranny.

I have looked at the RPM vs speed ratio and I can say that this bus is
nearly the same. Using VW documentation the 1968 at 3900 rpm max cruising
speed should be 65 mph. My bus 1963 is 3800 rpm is 65 mph at the guage.
Which is incorrect, because the guage is off for having 14 inch rims. I feel
that it is close to spec of 3900 at 65 MPH though.

It seems I have an unsual freeway flier, possibly more usefull then a larger
step that others have.

Jason
