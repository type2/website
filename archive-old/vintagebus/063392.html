Subject: Re: [VB] ARC vs. MIG - torsion bars

&gt;
&gt;one set, i believe the uppers, are cracked at the welds on both ends,
&gt;so that the leafs can be separated into 3 smaler groups. the lower set
&gt;is cracked only at one end, and only for 2 of the leafs.  [...]

I only have the '63 - '67 manual as a reference, but it seems like if
the leaves were originally welded, they need to stay welded, _unless_
you change to the later torsion arms that have a washer in the end to
keep the torsion bar leaves from working outward.

&gt;any and all VW service manuals i have read say to ARC weld.  will MIG 
&gt;be too hot or is there something special about that fancy looking,
&gt;nicely laid puddle that the factory did?

The '63-'67 manual calls for &quot;electric welding&quot;.  Thinking about what
most shops would have probably had at the time, their electric welder
would be an arc welder.  As far as I can tell, the only other kind of
welding that would have been common would have been oxy-acetylene &quot;gas&quot;
welding.

The engine section seems to back this up a bit - page M-14 9.  &quot;Close
the outer oil hole on all rocker arms with an electric welding spot...
Gas welding is not suitable.&quot;

I am guessing that they were concerned about the heat treatment on the
torsion bars.  I think the heat would be much more localized with arc
welding than with gas welding.  Since MIG is basically another kind of
arc welding, IMHO it would be OK.
