Subject: Re: [VB] 12V Interior Fans Final Results

ah, but he has air conditioning.

I'm going to have to invest in a new mister bottle for this upcoming trip.  

mister bottle + safari window = lo tek AC

.........................
&gt; Turn on  the fan and the cool air blows on your face, not the back of your 
&gt; neck!  It  is great and I wish that I had done it some time ago. Now I can 
&gt; drive in comfort to Jerome through the  desert!

Well, that only goes so far. It gets to a point where having hot air blown 
in your face is equally uncomfortable. You might add a mister system as 
well. We are thinking of that ourselves.
