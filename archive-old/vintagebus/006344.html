You can tell by holding a dollar bill over the oil filler hole with the
engine running. On a fresh engine or a tired one, it will nearly rip the
bill from your hand. As the rings seat it will just flutter a lot. Blowby is
the indicator. Your new pistons and cylinders come with carborendum grit in
them. This is designed to seat the rings fast, but the carborendum imbeds in
the cylinder walls and never quits doing its job. This is why you do such a
good job scrubbing them clean before we install them in the motor. And yes,
you want to use chitty oil for the first 500. I don't subscribe to the 2000
mile mark, but some do. I was in an Autozone the other day and they have a
poster proudly proclaiming that all of the waterpumper rebuilt motors come
with synthetic oil in them. What a great idea, not.

&gt; How can you tell if the rings are seated?  What does that
&gt; actually mean?  Do you really want to use crappy oil and let
&gt; the metal wear out a little for the first 500-2000 miles?
&gt; Why do the car manufacturers use new oil on a new engine?
&gt; They could save a bundle loading recycled oil into all the
&gt; new cars.
