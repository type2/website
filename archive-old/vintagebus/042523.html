See i would say the opposite... i like to have one wall to stack all the
crap up against, and the other side a door... that way all the crap wont
fall out everytime you open the door. (basically a DD would do me no good
as there would be so much stuff against those doors i'd never be able to
open them.)

The packrat road tripping accesory is a roof rack and cargo net... If it
wont fit inside strap it up top!

take care,
