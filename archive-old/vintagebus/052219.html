Subject: '59 Kombi...one night engine pull

When I first overhauled the engine in my '59 Kombi, I put it back in 
with  the old clutch parts. I realized right away that I was gonna need to 
replace that stuff. I ordered all new clutch parts and installed them. 
After driving the bus for 500 miles, the &quot;new&quot; pressure plate exploded on 
my. So I had to pull the engine again to replace. The parts guy said to 
send it back and he'd send me a new one, but I didn't want to wait. So I 
dug out my old one, cleaned it up, and put it on the engine. That old one 
worked great. I got about 5500 miles on it before....

The other day I started noticing a little trouble and realized it was the 
pressure plate. I got home late from work, sat around for an hour after I 
ate dinner, and finally decided to go do the duty. Took me about 3 hours to 
pull the engine, install the replacement pressure plate that had been sent 
to me months ago, and then put the engine back in. And i didn't even rush!!!

Man, it just amazes me how easy it is to PULL THE ENGINE in a vw! When I 
went to work the next day and told them what I did, nobody could believe 
it. &quot;yeh, I pulled my engine last night, fixed my clutch, put it back in, 
and drove it to work this morning&quot;. Bragging Bragging Bragging!!!!!

If you got a VW bus...you gotta brag!
