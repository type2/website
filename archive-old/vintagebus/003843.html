Well not really but it is a situation that I need remedied.  The mice got
into the seats up front in the 66 bus and the stench is quite overpowering
on a warm day.  I've yanked the seats and powerwashed the whole inside of
the bus.  Even after repeated days of airing out the bus, when I opened it
up today, I about gagged from the smell.  It all has to do with elements
called thials - the active ingredient in skunk spray and male cat urine (as
if you wanted to know.)

So is there any bonifide way to rid the bus of this smell?  Anyone had
experience with getting this stench out of an old vehicle?
I'm wondering if there isn't some kind of fumigation or perfume that I can
use to totally saturate the innards?  Even the smell of gasoline would be
better than smelling mouse piss.  Any suggestions from the Martha Stewart's
and Heloise's amongst us?
:-)
