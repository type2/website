HI NQ and list!

In the past most of the times I had to adjust the clutch on my VW's I did it
alone. I would get a piece of 2x4 and place it behind the clutch pedal until
it was depressed all the way to the floor, then I'd just wedge it in place.
Then to the back of the bus ( no jokes please) and I'd take a long
screwdriver and wedge it across the throw out arm ( bad terminology sorry,
but the one where the clutch cable goes through) and keep it in it's
depressed state or with the clutch arm pulled back toward the front of the
bus as if you had depressed the clutch to shift. Now back to the front of
the bus and remove the 2x4 on the pedal and you have a slack cable to work
with, no tension on it since the screwdriver had the throw out arm in its
fully depressed state. I'd then get a pair of Vice Grips and hold the end of
the cable where its crimped on ( again towards the front of the bus side,
about 1&quot; ahead of the throwout arm) and then adjust the wingnut or in your
case the 14mm nut. Sometimes I had to do this 2 or 3 times but I found with
practice this was much easier than fighting the tension on the cable in
those confined spaces. In going over this post I hope it's clear and I
apologize if it's too long. Good luck with future adjustments.
Britt
