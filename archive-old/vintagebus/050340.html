Subject: Clutch hub hits pressure plate hole
Message-Id: &lt;v04011703b3b0d8c34d5f_at_[207.55.127.51]&gt;

Hello wise people-

Last night I pulled the 1600 out of my 68 to replace the bell housing to
tranny gasket.  The engine had been in for about two weeks and~300 miles.
I had r &amp; r'd it  to chase oil leaks, replace muffler and clutch etc.  Upon
re-assembly I found the leak from the bellhousing to tranny  seam, so out
it comes again.

There was steel dust on the input shaft near the pressure plate.  The
source of it is the ID of the center hole in the pressure plate.  The OD of
the hub on the clutch disc is grinding away at it, apparently when the
clutch is pushed in too far.  The contact area is ~1/4 deep.  I wonder if I
mashed the clutch down too far to cause this.  It doesn't make any rude
clutch noises and feels ok.

The OD of the clutch hub is 1.172&quot;, and the ID of the center of the pp is
1.180.
These are measured with calipers  and may not be perfect - should be real
close though..  This doesn't seem like enough room for the one part to
slide inside the other.  The disc was new 2 weeks ago.  The pp has 34K
miles on it and looks ok.  I measured a new pp the same as the old one.

Are these two parts supposed to slide inside each other?  Did I mash the
clutch too far down?  Is there a spec for the OD of the clutch hub?  Should
I put it back together and not worry?  It seems it will clearance itself
eventually.

I perused 136 &quot;clutch AND pressure plate&quot; hits from the archive with no luck.

Puzzled in Seattle,

jeff small
