&gt; Well good
&gt; god - why didn't anyone tell me before?  I kind of feel like the list let me
&gt; down and I can only wonder what the next engine pull and installation is
&gt; going to bring up.  I'll probably have it installed and someone will say,
&gt; &quot;Did you do this and that to your connecting rods?&quot;  Geez - that's all I
&gt; need - another reason to go deeper...

Keep in mind that the lists are resources and _not_ the Oracles of VW
knowledge!  There are many different people here, of varying levels of VW
education, and all willing to put in their 2 cents of advice.  You should
take _everything_ you read here with a grain of salt, including stuff
written by that Lyle guy.

It isn't fair to blame the list for not telling you what to do.  Your
engine is your baby, and any deficiencies in its building is between
yourself and those who you have paid to perform tasks.  We cannot read
minds, and sometimes we make assumptions about skill and knowledge levels
that are a bit off.

The list is a free service, and the only guarantee is that you'll get
exactly what you paid for!
