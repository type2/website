&lt;&lt; We have a 59 panel with a ???65 1600 ??   F1998808  block  with fresh air 
heater.  How do we check if the valves for the heater are opening up to 
release the air over the heat exchangers Our heat to the interior works good 
when the valves are turned on and is off when off. &gt;&gt;
Hi P&amp;C,
Make sure the heater knob is turned off, and the VW is in nuetral with a 
working E-brake.  With the engine cold slid underneath, check the heater 
cables to make sure they are not pulling the heat exchanger valves open to 
the interior of the VW.  Then find the heater cooling outlet on the back side 
of the front end of the heater.  Have someone start the engine and feel for a 
flow of air coming out of the vent.  Slid over to the other side of the 
engine to check the other cooling vent.  Must do this fairly fast cause 
things tend to heat up too much to touch soon!  Eric&amp;Barb
