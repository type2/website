&gt; &gt; Anyone know of a source for the net that goes in the back cargo area of a
&gt; &gt; Split Window Westy?  I saw one of these some time back in a deluxe with
&gt; &gt; Westy interior.

&gt; I thought only 1969 pop top Westies had them......
&gt; Does a split window Westy have them??   Never seen one.....

I think the answer is no.  But.....if you want to use one out of an early bay,
you just need to install the snaps.  I think they are a very close match,
since the hatches of the late splits and early bays are the same.

Look on E-Rip Off auctions.  I seem them all the time.
