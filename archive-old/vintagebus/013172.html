&gt; Yep, this is a vacuum-advanced distributor.  I check
&gt; the vacuum diaph. and it
&gt; does werk....

 Not sure this is right or not but its workin for
me...
Flame suit on, so here goes.....
 I have a stock 1600 DP, oil bath to machine gun tip
muffler, AE case. I was running an 009, found a vac
dizzy at a swap meet. Ran the #s on it, was told by my
FLVWAPS that it was a '74 out of a T1, to be set _at_ 10
degrees BTDC. Ran hot as h*ll... asked several volks
on &amp; off the list.... ask 10 times, got 8 different
answers:| 
 I was told by several volks to set it at an idle,
hose off. Dont matter what it is at total advance, set
at idle &amp; go. That didnt work, got so hot you could
smell it(the engine). I figured if your never supposed
to run an 009 over 30-32 total, why not a vac also?
Total advace is total advance, right. Rev that puppy
up to 2500 set it at 30 BTDC, at 3500 rpm its at 32 at
an idle its at 2 degrees BTDC.... Runs great, starts
great, better milage compared to the 009. 75-80 mph on
the freeway for 20 minutes, pullover &amp; you could hold
the dipstick in your hands.(didnt try the spit
trick,were not that close yet:) I know its not the
correct way to do it, BUT, it worked for me. 
Conventional wisdom always told me to run an 009, this
is the first vac Ive played with in the 15 years of
Veedubbin:) Its a h*ll of alot smoother on take off...
no more neck-snappin starts, unless I want to;)
 Just a thought to ponder on....
Did I mention there is a degree pully involved in
there somwhere.....
Good Luck:)
