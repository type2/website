&lt;&lt; I have a question for the group. My understanding of copyright law is that
 &quot;any&quot; unauthorized reproduction of intellectual material is a copyright
 violation.
 
 If this is indeed the case, wouldn't an online archive of messages be just
 as much of an infringement of copyright as messages reproduced on CD-ROM?
 
 Any copyright attorneys out there want to take a stab at this one?

Yeah, I used to be one of those big shot copyright attorneys, til...til I 
fell on hard times. Now I just drive around in my bus.
