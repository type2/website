Times have changed.
At Sacramento last May, Dave heard came up to me and offered me 1K for the 
front, middle, and rear seats I had sitting next to my bus (I had another 
front, middle, and rear inside the bus), he got FURIOUS with me after I 
turned him down.
Times do change.
I remember paying 75$ for early middle seats.

&lt;&lt; It wasnt too many years ago that there was an auction
in California at which Dave Heard and others bought
NOS cases for something like $25 each because no one
was interested in them. It was reported in Hot VWs and
on the old Lenti email list. Do any of the old timers
rememer this?
Life is weird. $800 for a 36hp case and you could have
a whole bus or a Buick for just a little more...
