I just put my '60 Single Cab up for sale.  I'd like to get $1200 for it, but I'm in a very generous mood today.  If anyone is looking for something to do this weekend and wants to come and take it out of my storage building I'll let it go for $600.00.  This is a one weekend only offer.  Original color is Sealing Wax Red, currently the exterior is painted white.  Solid rockers, corners and doglegs.  Needs front cab floor corners and cargo floor under the gas tank only.  The rest of the floors are solid.  Frame is very solid.  It ran before I stripped it down.  No bumpers. Fresh set of oak bed slats come with it.

I need the space badly and don't feel like dicking around with lookie-loos.  This pickup is a steal at $600.  Strike while I'm vulnerable.
