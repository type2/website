Subject: re:Bus Stalling

Well,

I got it back from my mechanic last night, he said it should work fine...he
cleaned the carb...

SO I drove it home, only 2 blocks. No problems. Then a little while later I
thought I would take it for a test spin. I didn't get more than 5 blocks
before it started stalling on me. Unfortunately I was stuck in a &quot;One-Way&quot;
snafu, and it took a while to struggle home...a lot of stalling...but I made
it.

Today the weather broke a little bit, warmer but a light rain, so I went
down, took the carb off, dumped it out, sprayed a lot of cleaner through
it...and got it as clean as you could with out dismantling..

I re-installed and then fired it up...

It started and idled ok...

I noticed that the fuel filter between the fuel pump and the carb was not
really full of gas, and the longer it idled the lower the volume of gas in
the filter got, until there was barely any in there. How much fuel should be
in there while the bus is idling? 

It always seemed to be about 1/2 full whenever I looked at it
previously...but I didn't look at it too much.

Thanks
