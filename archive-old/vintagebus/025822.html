&gt; To All,        First of all the old editor of VW Trends is a friend of
&gt; mine,so I'm  a bias reader.
&gt; As a bus lover, I know we lost an editor who loves buses!!!!


What is up with that guy?  He moved in down the street from me and is the most
unfriendly person on the block.  I've tried waving and have even had my bus out
front working on it not even a smile.  Definitely not one of the friendly &quot;VW
people&quot; that I'm so used to .  Guess some people are shy or whatever.

Then there is the older gentleman that approached me at Ben &amp; Jerry's the other
night because of my OCTO shirt.  Turns out he is the original owner of a 60
DC.  Super nice folks, he and his wife.  We spoke for over a 1/2 hour about
busses and such.

Different strokes for different folks I guess.

Steve
