Hey Guys &amp; Gals!
So the the '66 Camper I brought home 2 weeks ago apparently was a panel van converted to a camper (which as I have read, seems to be pretty common). In re-doing the interior my question is this:  Do those top air vents on the very back panels serve any purpose?  Can I cover them and seal them with something from the inside to prevent &quot;intruders&quot; from entering there and raising a family (I live in the country and you would be amazed at the places mice and birds find to make their homes...there goes my property values!) And lastly, If anyone has done this, what did YOU do?  OK, I know that was actually three questions not one, I have a tendency to babble...see, there I go again...I'll try to stop...I promise...No, really........



Peace, John Baker
