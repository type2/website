2 things.....there is not enough contact between the striker plate and the
door lock.  There is room for adjustment there by loosening the contersunk
screws that secure it.
I would also look for metal fatigue or stress fracturing in/around the
door hinge points....both on the bus and the bus door itself where it is
riveted.  A possible source of &quot;flex&quot; could occur due to those.
Re: Rain as another commonality.....a cure for that would be to move to
Death Valley?????????
