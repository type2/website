1957 Hard Top Deluxe - Brought it back from Gary LaVere last year.  Mostly 
complete minus motor and tranny awaiting full restoration.  Ambulance fans, 
gas heater, fuel gauge, popouts and Sigla laminated glass.

1967 Kombi/Unknown Origin Camper - first VW and will be in the family 
forever.  Purchased with under 40k miles on it, 4th owner.  Rear passenger 
quarter panel was ripped off in an accident and has been repaired but now has 
an ugly yellow primer side on the nice old OG L87 Perl White.  Bashed in 
front nose from rear ending a police officer :(   Undergoing restoration 
slowly right now.  This is my daily driver for around 100 + miles a day
