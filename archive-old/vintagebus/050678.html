Subject: RE: [VB] Header woes

&gt;My lesson came from my rooff rack taking the trim off the bottom of my
&gt;garage door!
&gt;67 Single Cab
&gt;71 Trike
&gt;VolksAir
drove my recently-acquired bus and rack over to the PO's apartment... into
the parking bay. which was angled. got it in a ways, heard a BOOM, looked
in the rearview mirror and watched the spare tire suddenly drop into view
about 30 feet across the lot. it was really cartoon-like :)
PO and i spent 2 hours nailing the roof of the garage back onto the joists.
slightly twisted the front legs of the rack, but was easily fixed.
