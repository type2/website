Subject: Re: [VB] Stub axle threads messed up, know size?

Joe - I have a stub shaft out of my 67 bus setup and have the same problem
with severly boogered up threads.  If any one emails you with the info one
what size die to use, please forward it to the list.  There are a lot of
people out here who would like to file this info away.  For starters, on a
later bus trans, it's a 46mm nut whereas earlier ones were 36mm
