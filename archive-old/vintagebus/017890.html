I have to brag.

They filmed part of this movie on my street! (West
L.A.)
That bus was parked out in front of my house, and I
went up to it peeking in, trying to check it out. A
grip promptly shooshed me away, but then later they
came back and asked if they could plug the Craft
Services truck into our house outlet...for $200 a day!
We said &quot;no problem.&quot;
I should have negotiated for the bus. Although it had
no interior whatsoever. Those movie star busses are so
shallow. At least the extra&quot; busses are.

PS: My wife had to pull me away from the window
peeking out at the young ladies walkng back and forth
in &quot;Brady Bunch&quot; clothes (miniskirts) not to sound
like a perv, but it was pretty cool.
