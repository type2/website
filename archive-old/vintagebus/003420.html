Subject: Oil Leak Repair ?'s

Hello list! I've got the engine out of my bus due to the fact I'm leaking
alot of oil. I've decided to replace every seal I can without removing the
heads. The engine is running great other than the leaks!
  Question #1-Should there be a seal under the nut that holds the oil filler
to the alt. stand. Mine had one between the two; but not one on the inside.
  Question #2-Any tips on replacing the seals on a doghouse cooler? I've
never had one off and I think this is where alot of the oil is coming from.
  Question #3-Where is the best place to buy a fuel sending unit from
(12v.)?
