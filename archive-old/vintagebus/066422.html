Subject: RE: [VB] Mirror bracket?

  The dealer actually offered 2 different Elephant mirrors. There were the
VWoA style with the bolt through the stem and then the Roscoe (manufacturer)
style with the compression nut. It seems that the dealers used both styles
as I have had buses with both of them on it. Roscoe was still in business as
of a few years ago (they make truck mirrors) and those were the prevalent
ones out there before the Taiwan Roscoe style came about. West Coast Metric
makes the VWoA style but they painted the arms black, I do not know if this
is still the one they sell.
  I do sell the Roscoe style copies for 25 dollars a PAIR

Subject: RE: [VB] Mirror bracket?


Thanks for the replies regarding the bracket for my elephant ear
side-view mirror.  The answer to several people's question is that it
isn't an original VW dealer-installed mirror, but rather an aftermarket
one I put on about 10 years ago, so I'm afraid the VW models won't fit.
I think I'll be buying a replacement for the whole thing.

Thanks,
	Mark, markt_at_duke_dot_edu
