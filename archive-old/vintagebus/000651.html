Hi Volks, 
Forgot to mention that we like to polarize our generators even before 
installing in the fanshroud.  This results in a lot of saved time if the 
generator is bad in the first place.  All one needs is jumper cables.  Hook 
the jumpers cables to the battery, making sure the other ends are not 
touching!  Then take the other ends, and hold the ground wire to the side of 
the generator by pinning it to the generator with the side of your right 
hand.  Hold the positive wire with the right hand making sure to not touch 
the ground wire.  Then spin the rear end of the generator shaft with your 
left hand in clockwise direction.  Touch the positive cable to the generator 
D+ terminal for about 15 seconds making sure the generator continued to turn 
clockwise.  Eric&amp;Barb
