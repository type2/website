If it was just me talking, I'd vote for vapor expansion based on the
vapor carbon filter return sytem being promoted and serviced so much in
Wyoming car dealerships. Worland is located at 4795 feet which is fairly
high, and there are quite a few towns we traveled to in the shell
mountains that were at 8500-9500 feet which made your tank burp a lot
when you pulled the cap off to fill her up.

we need a petro engineer or physicist in on this one - does the
GASOLINE expand, or does the increase in vapor pressure (basically,
more gasoline turning into  vapor due to heat) FORCE the gas out of
the filler neck etc.
