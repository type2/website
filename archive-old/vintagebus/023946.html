Subject: 65 Samba progress

I thought i would give a little update on the 65 Samba's progress.

As i have posted in the past, i am doing a full ground up resto of my
65.  I am restoring it back to original factory conditions as closely
and the pocket book will allow.

A few weeks ago i towed the bus shell over to Charlie Hammils to have
some welding done.  He installed my Safari (German) windows, welded
(Re-welded my poor atempt to weld myself) my floor panel sections in,
welded in a replacment window hinge and a window lock plate.  I also was
able to get info from him on how/what/where and why the factory painted
the bus's originally.

The bus in back home now up on blocks.  The body work above the floor
and inside is 99% done.  I still have to block it out.  I got the idea
that i should take a little time to prep the bottom and paint it.  A
time consumming job, but will make the project look complete.  I am not
going to do detail prepping down there, just make it look good and hold
paint.  I will concentrate on the wheel wells.  I am trying to figure
out the best way to get the cosmoline off the belly pan's to paint.  Any
ideas?

Otherwise, i am waiting for time to finish.  I have chosen my colors and
got a real shock on teh paint price.  The VOC law's here in Cali have
made paint REAL EXPENSIVE.  I also am looking for a HVLP gun.

As for parts, i have had some sucess in finding them.  Most of the trim
has been located. My main part i need is a 2/3 seat donor.  I am looking
for a complete w/ bad upholdtry seat for a 65.  Any leads in the So./No
cal area?

Otherwise, it is off to sand/block and paint.

I will update as things progress

Thanks
Matthew
