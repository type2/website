Is that Larry? The guy who delivered my Middle seat
from Solvang to a guy uo North?
If so, it's a sweet all orig. Westy with original
tent, potty toilet, etc. etc. etc.  And if so, sorry
to see it on a trailer.

&gt; Hi all,
&gt; Early hatch-top westy sighting yesterday. Looked to
&gt; be 62-64 hatchtop with 
&gt; early woodslat rack on top. Colors were faded
&gt; sealing wax red with an 
&gt; off-white top. Bus appeared to be in extremely nice
&gt; original looking 
&gt; condition. Not too sure if it was just purchased as
&gt; it was being trailered 
&gt; north-bound 680 in Martinez towards Sacramento, Ca.
&gt; It was around 1:30 in the 
&gt; afternoon. Two younger guys in a 4x4 Ch*vy Suburban
&gt; towing it.
&gt; 
&gt; Just curious if anyone knows who owns it or if
&gt; someone on the list just 
&gt; acquired it.
&gt; Whoever has it, has a nice bus.
&gt; 
&gt; Hope everyone has a great turkey day,
&gt; Dave Barnes
&gt; 63 15-window walk-thru

&gt; looking for more.....
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt;
&gt; For help leaving the list, send a HELP message to
&gt; VINTAGEBUS-REQUEST_at_TYPE2.COM
