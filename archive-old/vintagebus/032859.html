 Hi folks.
 
 Just bought a 67 deluxe 21-window in a lovely shade of
 tar black with a nifty red beltline and nose. 
 I have 2 options:
 1) Get the vanity plate &quot;DARTHVW&quot;
 or
 2) Paint it. 
 
 Obviosly, option 2 is the desireable choice. Now comes
 my question(s). The original paint was sea blue/white.
  My favorite old bus color is Sealing Wax Red/Beige
 grey. They didin't offer this combo after 64 or 65. In
 67 the red was Titan Red with white.
---------------------

er- go for no. 1  

give it the 60,000 mi service and drive to Jerome.

BTW- it is Titian red, not Titan.   Titans are large mythological creatures.  
Titian (pronounced Tish-an) was a painter who painted some really nifty 
pictures, and evidently this red was a shade he used a lot so VW called it 
Titian red.

think Thom's website has a list of what years which colours were used (or am 
I wrong Thom) as your list of what was used when was slightly off

are you wanting to do a resto?  or have a bus to drive around?  Are you 
wanting to paint anyway?  its kinda a PITA and you can't drive while it is 
taken apart.  There are half a billion pieces for a deluxe, and more bodywork 
to do,    so why not drive it and slowly collect the pieces as you get the 
bus sorted and all to little things nice (like matching keys, working 
interior lights and find a door handle to replace the one on the cargo door 
that is broken off)
