Subject: Re: [VB] hangin a rear bumper

&gt;&gt;At the risk of seisure by the rest of the vintage nazis here (myself
included), I never have had the end attachment points in operation.&lt;&lt;

Cal,
I don't think you need to fear the vintage nazi's too much on this point. I
heard from two listee's on the side that both pretty much echoed your same
point.
Now if my question was, how to mount a bumper to keep it from dragging
because the bus is &quot;slammed&quot;.................well, I probably would of wisely
kept that one to myself!!
Thanks for the help!!
Tom
