&gt; I picked up a &quot;custom&quot; gas tank this weekend that came out of single
&gt; cab. It's just like what I had considered making and I got it for
&gt; $10, so I think I did OK. The dimensions are
&gt;
&gt; 34&quot; X 15.5&quot; X 8&quot;

&gt; My rusty math comes up with about an 18 1/4 gallon tank. Am I close?
&gt; If not, what's the right answer.

In meters, these are:

34/39.4=0.86m
15.5/39.4=0.39m
8/39.4=0.20m

multiply these to get cubic meters:

0.86x0.39x0.20=0.067m^3

Since a cubic meter is 1000 liters:

0.067x1000=67.1 liters

for those who don't do metric, 1 liter is 0.264 gallons:

67.1x0.264=17.7 gallons

Which is a bit more than a Bay tank.  Nice find!
