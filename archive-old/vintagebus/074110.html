X-ACNS-MailScanner: Found to be clean
Subject: stock, original, period

The thread on &quot;restoration&quot; got me thinking about my own preferences, 
especially lately with my '65 Neunsitzer (my 221, using Hollis 
Nomenclature :).  No one will ever mistake one of my VWs for a vintage 
restoration (well, actually, some civilians do), but I try to keep it 
looking at least &quot;period&quot; in terms of accessories and add-ons.  It's 
just more fun for me and part of what I like about these old machines - 
the times they came from.  I don't look down on (all) customs, just not 
my bag.  Guy brought a nicely tricked out Vanagon to a recent meeting 
of our local club: custom sunroof and aluminum sheeting in interior, 
neons inside and out, Subaru engine.  It was very cool, but I think I'd 
rather have a Honda Element. :)

I agree with the observation that some &quot;true&quot; restorers are going for 
points or recognition and hate any dilution of the term &quot;restored&quot; 
either because of their time and effort or just a sense of 
perfectionism, obsession, or being a completist.  I can relate to the 
latter, since I do keep a list of the remaining original parts I'm 
still hunting for my cars, and I can get crazy about camper parts  (&quot;Is 
that a correct drawer pull?&quot;).  When you expend effort on that it does 
make you get kinda huffy about the half-*ssed work of others if it's 
equated with yours.

But then, in the grand scheme of Important Things it's a -- a what out 
of 10?  You have to consider just how important and valuable a concours 
restoration or a complete, original Westy is in this world.  It's just 
a hobby, a luxury.  Just a machine.  It's not even art.  You don't get 
any more karmic points than a bodybuilder or someone with a nicely 
landscaped lawn.  Never forget: you can earn way more by making someone 
smile.

Of course, if you can make them smile with a nice looking bus (restored 
or otherwise), you get extra special bonus karma.  It says so right 
here.
