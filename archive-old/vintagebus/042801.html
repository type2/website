Subject: FS: 63 Dbl Cab Project, KS
Message-ID: &lt;Pine.BSI.3.96.980723225605.5634B-100000_at_usr09.primenet_dot_com&gt;

Hi All,

I checked out a lead on a 63 Dbl Cab project today.  It's not for me, but
would be a good project for someone.  It has the usual inner &amp; outer
rocker rust, has the original off white paint w/ some primer spots.  Looks
like most parts are there and also a 63 Single cab's parts.  
  Anyway, the dbl has a pretty straight body and gates,
but the nose is dented, but not smashed.  It supposedly has a 1600 single
port in good running shape, but needs wiring etc. The tranny looked greasy
and original with a solid from mount.  Decent bumpers etc., has the seats
etc., but.  It has an off-road KS title that should be in the owner's
hands soon.  The truck has not had too many owners.  Also, it has the 15&quot;
rims etc..  The 63 SC parts truck has been chopped up, but the cab is
still intact and has a good nose and some glass.  

It  needs a lot of labor
and nose &amp; rocker welding.  Structurally it looks fine.  It has a front
suspension out of a 67 Arizona bus in very good shape.  He replaced many
of the brake parts.  I made a low
offer (all I could afford).  After that, he stated what he wanted:  $1500.
He'd probably take less though if you're serious.  email me for more info
