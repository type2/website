Subject: garcia buses

Hey All,
    I finally picked up the two Garcia buses yesterday.The church I bought
them from has a full service garage .They fix up donated cars and give them
away to single moms.They allowed me and my GOOD friend Brian Holcomb to use
one of there lifts to give the buses a once over.The 59 is in tip top
shape,oil changed ,charge the battery and she was ready to roll ! A total
cream puff.The 66 deluxe needed a rear shifter coupler and clutch.We
replaced the coupler on there lift, changed the oil, adjusted the valves,
set the timing, fix tail lights a new battery etc.My friend Brian and I
decided to drive them to his Dads' shop in Watertown Wisc.. Brian and his
Dad are  Vw. mechanics, and have a full shop.I have no room at all left in
my garages and he offered storage and a place to replace the clutch.He drove
the 66,with no clutch,I know it's hard on the starter but towing was not an
option.I drove the 59.The 59 with its 40 horse motor has a top speed of 50
mph.It took us a while to make the 100 mile trip.People on the road were
freaking out over the two buses.We almost caused a few fender benders.We
also stopped a soccer game as all the kids stopped playing to checked out
the two hippy buses.We arrived in Watertown to find another good friend of
ours installing a new wiring harness in a 66 bus for one of the Holcomb's
customers.His girl friend is in love with the 66,this bus will be for
sale,though Dan K. has first dibs on her.I then decided to drive the 59 back
home to Barrington Il.in the dark.Though I had just bought this bus I felt
very confident in her,.I made the 100 mile drive in just under 3 hours.I
LOVE this bus.It has it's original 5 firestone whitewall bias ply tires.It's
still 6 volts.Original 40 horse.Though I'm not sure if it's the bastard case
or not,I'll pop off a valve cover today to find out.If not it has a Vw.
warranteed 40 horse case.The interior is very near perfect.She purred all
the way home.
I think I'll drive her to work today.
