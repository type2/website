I just took some pics with the digital camera.  I have some of my lowered vw 
73 thing. and some of my brother beating the Sh*t out of a old vw bus with 
his baseball bat.  some are kinda blurry but.  if you wanna see p-mail me.  
and p.s.
to the vanagon list
i hope your fuel injected water boxers don't crash in Y2K!  i better go check 
my RBG computer temp analizer and make sure its Y2K compliant.  i hope this 
list keeps on cookin well into the next millenium.
happy new year
