Subject: Re: [VB] singlecab slat scre spacing?

Sounds like a PO may have welded the original holes shut rather than
replace the wood runners himself.  If so, I think that you should be
able to find evidence of the original hole spacing by checking for
welding spots on the underside of the bed.  This you can do by looking
inside the treasure chest, gas tank compartment, and engine compartment.

My personal preference is to deviate from the original VW installation
procedure and secure the runners with #12 half-inch panhead screws from
the bottom.  This can be done with some careful extra prep.  Leaves the
top surface of the runners smooth and unbroken, and improves the
strength of the wood since there are no holes drilled completely through
it.  Did this for my '67 DC and I think it looks very presentable.

&gt; I am about to put the oak slats in my 63 singlecab.
&gt; I see from the dropgates website that VW installed these with pop rivets post
&gt; September 11960. Does anyone know the correct spacing for the rivets or can I
&gt; do just what looks right?
&gt; Any opinions as to what looks right?
&gt; BTW I will use blind rivets and stainless washers.
