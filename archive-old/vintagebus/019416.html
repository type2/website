Don't get you're hopes up. That thing used to sit at their other body shop 
lot down the way for about 2 years. I checked on it way back then. The 
truck is owned by the dealership owner and NFS! It is just on display. 
They told me it brings in LOTS of people :-) BTW I think it is a 
55-57.....has hoops too. 

Even Chevy thinks VWs are cool!
