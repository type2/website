&gt; The event is upon us. I will be arriving at about 3:00 Friday
afternoon.Upon
&gt; checking in
&gt; please tell them you are with the vw group and or give them my name so
they
&gt; know where
&gt; to send you. This is a very large campground and they seem a bit
&gt; unorganized. They have
&gt; blocked us for at least 15 sites. But I think we will go over that amount
of
&gt; buses.I asked
&gt;  for the area that we had last year. If you are going and haven`t
contacted
&gt; me you can until Thurs.
&gt; evening. But if you don`t that`s ok too. We are planning the potluck for
&gt; Sat. evening and breakfast
&gt; Sun. morning. If you can contribute that would be great. Bring firewood if
&gt; you can also.
&gt; They rape you for it at the campground. If anyone has any questions or
need
&gt; directions
&gt; just contact me.
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; Dave Parsons
