Subject: Roof Racks

I found a deal for you guys. Volks Cafe in Santa Cruz,
CA (831.426.1244)has the Wood slat roof racks (made in
China) at a real good price. Ask for Lee. He helped me
out and was real easy to deal with. These aren't the
PIP racks so the quality isn't as great but for $275
it is worth it. The one that i bid on EBAY sold for
over $350. Try this link for a PIC

He told me that if he can get 4 people who want to buy
he would give us a even better price.
