&gt;  I know the 67 being 12 
&gt; V makes a lot of parts different so I don't know
&gt; whether to take 
&gt; advertisements for parts that say pre-67 seriously
&gt; or not.  Should I seek 
&gt; counseling or do you think another cold beer will
&gt; take care of it?

Have another cold beer, more therapuetic than
counseling. Remember, to some people it's a six pack,
for the rest of us it's a support group.
