&lt;&lt; This bus had been sitting for a few years and I'm scared as hell about the 
upcoming trip. Nothing at all seems to be wrong. That's what freaks me out. &gt;&gt;
Hi Shawn,
Do the steps you have listed and install a dual circuit master brake 
cylinder.  Then drive around town 15 to 30 minutes with a minumum 15 minute 
cool down stop between each trip and every 50ish miles change the oil for at 
least the first 300 - 500 miles or until the oil stops turning black in only 
50-100 miles of driving.  Since this engine has sat it has to repolish all 
the bearings and cylinder surfaces.  Also there is going to be sludge that 
settled out over the years while sitting which will come loose and block up 
the oil cooler or passages to the bearings.
  Make sure to take plenty of tools and spare parts and enjoy!  If you want 
our list of spare parts just tell us and we will Pmail you them.  Eric&amp;Barb
