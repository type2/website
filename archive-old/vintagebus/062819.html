Subject: I did the unspeakable

   My wife has wanted a new car for a long time now. It's to hot for her to
drive her rag top beetle, she won't drive any of my buses, so I went out and
bought her a NEW car. I really would of liked to get her a VW product, but
with all the BS that VW is doing I followed suit and bought her a PT Cruiser
(at least it looks retro) instead of a VW product (I really wanted a
Eurovan).. I am going to take a pic of it in front of my 6 buses and her bug
at my house and send it to VWoA customer relations with a note saying &quot; I
would have bought one of your products, but with no support of VWoA in the
vintage community I refuse to help support you (VWoA)

sighed  a loyal vintage VW owner
