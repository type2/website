Subject: Re: [VB] Front bearing packing theory...




Besides thoroughly re packing the bearings themselves before installing
them into the drums, just how much grease should be put into the cavity
&quot;between&quot; the inner and outer bearings in each drum.  I've heard various
theory s and opinions on this, and I, as well as others, would like to do
it right.  In the past on my '67 Westy, I've packed it as full as possible,
basically leaving little or no room for air in there once the drum was
reinstalled on the spindle.  I haven't had any problems yet with doing it
this way so far, but I've heard others say to not over pack it with grease,
to leave unpacked room in there, although I've never heard a good reason
why to do it this way.  Does grease from this cavity really work it's way
into the bearings if the cavity isn't fully packed, or are we just wasting
grease by fully packing it up.  If you are of the &quot;don't pack it full&quot;
school of thought, please explain this theory fully so we can understand
better.  Otherwise, I'm gonna pack it full, going with &quot;the more grease,
the better&quot; train of thought.  For the collective good of all, how about a
few of you experienced/knowledgeable mechanics address this Transporter
issue in descriptions and explanations we can all understand.  Bentley sure
doesn't say much about it.

********************************************************************************

NO!  More grease IS NOT better. You only need enough to pack the bearings.
Too much grease WILL overheat the bearings. As per Mercedes-Benz and
they have been building cars longer than anyone else!
