Subject: My new bus-Thanks to listees
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

Hey everyone,
After one damn long year and a few months, I have a bus again!  Man o man am 
I stoked.  It's a pearl white 63 EZ.  Picked her up this weekend in Phoenix.  
Big thanks to Jim Ellis.  Really a great guy and a great family.  I couldnt 
of asked for a better guy to deal with.  Really helped me out with the bus 
and was just a great guy.  
Also thanks to Kyle and DeDe for the hospitality and grub...you guys are too 
nice. Was good seeing the Havasu boys again, and also nice meeting JP and 
Micah..another bunch of great guys.
Im just too damn stoked about being a bus owner again...not only that it's a 
PURTY bus...first  one ive had that was painted...unless primer counts  hehe
Realized how glad I am I found this list...I've many so many friends and met 
so many great people.
Details on the bus to come...as soon as i find time,

Beto
