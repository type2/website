I designed a 2&quot; dia board that will hold that circuit in a standard
cup.
let me know if you want the artwork for it.

&gt; &gt; &lt;&lt; Was it you that was suggesting that you would like to find a circuit
for
&gt; &gt;  a O2 mixture sensor? I'm referring to an exchange a while back where we
&gt; &gt;  were talking about gauges for the VWs. &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt; Hi Paul,
&gt; &gt; Yes that was us!  Thank you for passing on the info for this.  We just
took a
&gt; &gt; look at that web page.  It looks interesting and will see what we can
figure
&gt; &gt; out.  Now to get a better grasp of electronics!   Eric&amp;Barb
&gt;
&gt; I would GLADLY led my help to any listee needing to work this one out or
&gt; questions with same.  Call it a chance to give a little back to the list.
Bring
&gt; on the questions!  I am currently adding the sensors in my exhaust
manifolds and
&gt; will be reading their outputs.  I won't be using the nice bar graph
circuit that
&gt; the drawing shows, but I used four of those back in 1984 to make a real
KEWL
&gt; tachometer with green, yellow and red LEDs.  Worked like a champ.
