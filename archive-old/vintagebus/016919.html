Subject: [VB] exhaust leak by head

After giving the bus the usual tune-up I was back by the engine for some 
reason and peered under it because I noticed water under the right side.  
Nothing abnormal until I pressed the accelerator on the carb.  White smoke 
from between the #2 cylinder and head.  I showed my wife and accidentally 
shot some smoke right into her face, but it was a good laugh anyways.  I've 
got the 'problem sounds' from a Muir website, and it verifies a loose head.  
But I just retorqued the heads 1482 miles ago and did not have this problem. 
  Will tightening down the corner head bolt solve this problem or will I 
have to replace the heads?  This is my replacement engine until I get my 
other one that lost all oil pressure rebuilt.  ANYONE GOT AN ENGINE FOR SALE 
IN THE WA AREA?  If the heads need replacing, how do I know what size to 
get?  I was told it was a 1.6L, but it doesn't feel like it.  The case reads 
F-series which would indicate a '65 Bug, 1.5L which it feels like as far as 
acceleration goes.  Happy driving for now--Chet
