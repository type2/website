Hi Stephen and list,
I've been following all the different posts on gas mileage for split screen 
busses on the list for a few years and have come to this conclusion. Busses 
will not get 28mpg or more. I think people that do have their speedo off. I 
finally have my motor dialed in, and on the freeway I get around 22-23mpg. 
Around town I get 16-17. I know it could be better around town but that's 
what I get. The motor is a stock 1600DP with a 34PICT-3 and a 009 dizzy. I 
plan to swap dizzy's out for a stock dual vac. advance which should also 
increase the mpg. The tranny is stock and doesn't have a freeway flyer. Not 
too sure how much increase in mgp a diff. tranny would have though. I drive 
55-60 on the freeway.
Please let me know if you have come to any other conclusion.
Good luck,
Dave Barnes
