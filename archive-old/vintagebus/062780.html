Subject: RE: [VB] HELP in Amirillo Texas

   We haven't been able to find a trans reasonable price in Amerillo, 500
for a used plus core! Rich Kimbrough is putting one on a grayhound from
Phoenix and Britt should have it by tommorrow noon. Also Rex Rodgers has
called Britt with a list of names in Amerillo for Britt to try. It sounds
like it's all coming together with the HELP of the list, isn't this what
driving buses is all about. I feel sad for Britt though as he sent Bryant
on, so he is solo in Amerillo.  Will keep all the list updated.
