Subject: RE: [VB] VW Authorized Dealership Inspection

Geez! Sounds just like my luck with my ebay bus!
It works out eventually, as anything with a lot of sweat invested.
I even got accused of causing a stroke in the 'bad' mechanic, after I had
the BBB give him a call. That's when he went after suit for Intentional
Emotional Distress, shady little bastard.
The AT General is after fruadulent/misleading advertising primariliy, but
general fraud in business whould be of interest.
Expert witness will be a great asset, to testify to the original shop's
inabilities.

&gt; You don't have to have an &quot;Authorized VW&quot; estimate to go to court. You
&gt; do have to have _paid_ invoices from a repair shop, any repair shop,
&gt; to show the judge before you can expect to receive a judgment against
&gt; the 1st mechanic.

Diane's second repair shop is &quot;Scooter&quot; :)
The authorized VW Dealer Inspection should have included
a cost estimate for the repair of an oil leak, since that's why she went
there and now plans to return for. They do repair old vw's. It is unclear if
the leak is a rear (?) main seal or a cracked case so the estimate will be
very different for each of these.

They refused to provide documentation for brake defects and steering
defects, and substituted rusty muffler, and was told that the $75/hour
charge ( which took 30 minutes ) would have to be applied separately for
each individual problem. Pretty expensive estimate. We think that she can
get estimates for each of these extra problems from Midas muffler, brake
shops, alignment shops, etc. for free.

&gt; Also, you should send a _polite_ letter to the 1st repair shop
&gt; outlining
the
&gt; problems or items that you paid them for that are still not repaired.
&gt; Send it registered mail, return receipt requested. In the letter,
&gt; state that
you
&gt; require that they respond to you within a reasonable amount of time
&gt; (30
days
&gt; or so) or you will be forced to take your car to another shop to have
&gt; the repairs done.

The registered letter is a very good idea, but she has no confidence in the
original shop and no way to police another shoddy repair scam there.

She has not yet explored the Better Business Bureau,
The Department of Motor Vehicles ( it's a registered repair shop ) or the
Attorney General. And she bought the bus on Ebay. The repairs may well
exceed the limits of small claims court.
