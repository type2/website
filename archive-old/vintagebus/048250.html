&lt;&lt; I have a couple of questions about wiring up a 6 volt wiper motor which
 has three connectors (two hot and one ground, I know which one is the
 ground, but I'm not sure how to wire up the two hot ones.) to 12 volt
 system. How? A wiring daigram  would be great if that is not too much
 trouble, please.&gt;&gt;
Hi George,
If it is a late split screen wiper motor that you have then one of the 
positive terminals is high speed while the other is low speed.  If you have a 
type I wiper motor jury rigged in there or a late bus motor they both have 
run terminals and a parking terminal.  In otherwords the parking terminal 
only has power through most of the wiper action and is to return the wiper 
arms to thier parked postion.  If this motor has the parking terminal and is 
6 volt and you run it on voltage that is too high the parking system will not 
function due to much inertia making the wipers pass the park are.  In wiring 
systems with this parking circuit the park terminal is on constantly.

&lt;&lt;I'm also installing some Hella 5-1/2 round chrome fog lights and I need 
some coaching on the wiring. The fog lights have one wire coming out from 
them and so I take it that they're self grounding. I purchased a 30 amp 
universal relay from Radio Shack ( I'm not sure if that is enough amps, but 
the fog lamps are from the sixties) and I also picked up 10 ft. of 12 gauge 
electrical wire. So how would I go about wiring
 everything up? As you can tell I'm somewhat lost and would greatly 
appreciate any help you could give, Thank you Eric and Barb!!!  &gt;&gt;
  Most likely those fog lights ground through thier mountings.  It would be 
best for you to check to make sure, and if so consider woring in a grounding 
wiring system for them to prevent loss of lighting.  Next it would be best to 
buy some new bulbs that you know the wattage of.  Then wire the main power 
wire to the relay from the wire directly from the battery/generator as it 
gets to the fuse box.  You probably want these lights on thier own switch.  
That way you can use them seperately from the headlights.  So you need a 
switch, maybe one that you could hide under and just forward of the dash out 
of sight, like a rocker switch.  Wire this switch between the headlight 
switch on the low beam terminal and your relay.  This way if you want to run 
fog lights you turn on the low beams and flick on the switch under the dash 
to the relay.  If you forget that the fog lights are on they will go off if 
you remember to at least turn off the headlight switch.  Remember to put in 
fuses for each fog light between the relay and lights!  The last thing you 
need to figure out is if that relay is for two 30 amp bulbs, or two bulbs for 
a total of 30 or less amps.   
Hope this all helps, Eric&amp;Barb
