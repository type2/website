New wiring harness, hooked it up, but the parking lights stay on with the
headlights on, is this a problem with the way it is wired, or is the switch
bad? The truck has just been painted and being put back together, so I do not
know the previous history of the switch. Asking for a friend.

I suppose you have a colour wiring diagram when you hooked it up (or your
friend did).   It might be a good idea to double check all is hooked up to the
right places- the little numbers on the hind end of the switch are the codes
for attaching the wires.
