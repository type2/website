One thing to check is the flange on the case where the oil cooler adaptor
mounts. I had an engine that leaked from around the oil cooler and couldn't
figure out where it was coming from. Turned out that the flange had a crack
and was leaking right out from the case. If you really cranked down on the
mount bolts this could be your problem. I had a local shop weld it for me
and it worked fine.

&gt; hi list,
&gt; here is my situation,   i changed the oil in my 1600, dual port, doghouse
66
&gt; bus the other day,   it is a new brazilian case, less than 7000 miles.  2
&gt; days later it is leaking pretty bad , drip drip drip, i swear i only put
in
&gt; a little over  2 quarts when i changed the oil.
&gt; i jumped right on it the next day, pulled the engine in 26 minutes, took
off
&gt; the shroud, and the oil cooler looked pregnant, i happened to have another
&gt; one, brand new , both of them are brazilian oil coolers, so i put it on,
put
&gt; it back together,reinstalled (3hours total time on gravel), and bam, it
&gt; worse than before,
&gt; now it is pouring out of the left side, so im thinking maybe the seals
arent
&gt; right, so next day i pulled the engine again, and i had left a washer on
the
&gt; stud that the oil cooler adapter goes on, so i though hmm, i tightened the
&gt; oil cooler extra tight, put it back together no improvement, arghhhh, its
&gt; worse, so im thinking that maybe im crazy and it s the front seal, but it
&gt; isnt, there is absolutely not a drop of oil around the flywheel.
&gt; i took it out a third time today, and replaced the adapter seals, no luck,
&gt;
&gt; the oil is clearly coming from the left side with the main drip coming
from
&gt; the place where the bottom tin screws into the block, and its dripping
down
&gt; the front of the tin directly under the oil cooler and running down on to
&gt; the tranny mount.  It looks as though the new oil cooler is leaking on the
&gt; inside down from where the top 2 studs from the adapter go through it,
there
&gt; is a little pool of oil on the inside at the bottom stud of the oil
cooler,
&gt; but the oil is so clear and new that by the time the engine is out it is
&gt; very hard to see where it is coming from.
&gt; I have searched the archives for hours, and i apologize for this boring
&gt; post, but i really need to know the following:
&gt; 1) is there something i should know about brazilian oil coolers, are they
&gt; notoriously bad or something?
&gt; 2) could i have ruined the new oil cooler by tightening it down too much
to
&gt; the adapter?
&gt; 3) which doughnut seals are the right ones for attaching the adapter to
the
&gt; block?
&gt; 4) any suggestions ?
&gt;
&gt; im sure someone out there  has gone through this, the one good thing is
that
&gt; removing and installing the engine is nothing to me now, i hardly even
break
&gt; a sweat, :o).
