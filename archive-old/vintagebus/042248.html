tanks in wrecking yards]

I think it's to make sure that the tanks are empty, though it might be
some sort of environmental edict to ensure that the tanks aren't sold.

Another wierd rule is that wrecking yards cannot sell used catalytic
converters, probably promoted by the New Catalytic Converter Manufacturers
of America.
