Subject: Re: [VB] Panel Interior----

&lt;&lt;&gt;
I used to have a '73 bus with an interior like this. ceilings? carpet.
floors? carpet. walls? mostly carpet, plus fake wood paneling! it was
awesome.&gt;&gt;

And a plus is. . . women go absolutely bonkers for this look, too. . . I
don't know what it is about shag carpet. . . must be a throwback to
caveman days. . . but when they see it they just start taking off
clothes!!! :)

Has the same effect on me, too.
