&gt;  Anyway, going back to that Binz, it didn't get even
&gt; close to the reserve price. I wonder why??///
&gt;

Too much negative hype would be my guess...............

I have pictures of a Binz in my possession that I'm told is a
'57........could that be?

I started looking for one after I missed out on VWHowards....DOH!!! Anyway I
came across this one and have never seen it in person just pictures. I can
say it looks alot better than the one on eBay but who's to say. The one I
know of needs the rear seat and some other pieces as well. I know rear sear,
GOOD LUCK!! The asking price was up around $4000 and it needs some work so I
patiently look elsewhere for another one in better shape at a better price.

If anyone knows of a Binz rear seat I'd appreciate he lead............

Greg
