Hello Everyone

    I just got back from putting gas in my Bus and I got down my street and
I could not shift anymore. I stopped the bus and was able to get it into
gear to get it home. But when it is out of gear it wants to move forward and
the engine starts to drag when I let out the clutch. Is it time for a new
Transmission and  who makes good rebuilds. Please Help!

Sincerely
Eric and Christy Lykens
67 Deluxe Bus!
