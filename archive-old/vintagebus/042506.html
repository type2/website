Subject: the problem with the round repro mirrors (or, how i learned to start
 shaking and love the bomb)
Message-ID: &lt;Pine.BSF.4.10.10004202027420.1363-100000_at_users.anet-stl_dot_com&gt;

well,

I &quot;happened upon&quot; the problem with the round aluminum taiwan reproduction
mirrors and why they vibrate like heck.

I was banging on my driver side hinge trying to figure out why my door
shuts funny. and the head fell off of the little stem thing that the clamp
holds...

what it looks like caused it:
the post thing with the round ball on the end of it goes through that
washer with the part numbers stamped on it, then it goes through the VERY
THIN aluminum the mirrors are made from, then it is expanded like a pop
rivet, but just a little bit. So the only thing holding these together is
a pop rivet type thing in very thin aluminum, but the pop rivet isnt
terribly expanded.

I would guess that the originals have a washer inside the mirror so the
thin aluminum is sandwiched between two thicker washers, that would hold
much better.

If i had JUST recieved these the first thing i would do is take green
loc-tite sleeve retainer and put it on there, it &quot;wicks&quot; between already
assembled parts so it might hold them together pretty well.  I'm going to
try that on my passemger side mirror which has yet to come apart.

On my drivers side mirror which has fallen apart, i'm going to make sure
that the post is really secure to the washer with the PN stamped on it,
and then JB weld it back together.

I'll let you all know how the loctite works on the passenger one, and if
the JB weld fixes the drivers side one.

take care,

Steve
