Ya, that was a great calendar.  Still hanging in my garage.

&lt;&lt; That calendar is ok, the photos lack some originality.
 But why is it 10 splits, one vanagon and one eurovan?
 It should have been all splits or a mix of all years.
 The best calendar ever for buses was the NEATO, Bulli
 Kartei, Split Screen Van club calendar about 6 years
 back.
