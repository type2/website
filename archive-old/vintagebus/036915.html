Subject: removing trans in a rusty 61
Message-ID: &lt;89d21057.246cc617_at_aol_dot_com&gt;

Did part of the tranny pull.

One of the axle nuts was a real bear.  Broke a sweat getting it loose.   Did
you know this is the coldest may since 62 around here?   When is summer?

knocked the lugs loose, loosened the bolts at the RGBoxes, for some reason
some were 17mm and others 19mm.  nice.     Undid the front tranny mount.
Unbolted the rear shocks.  Think I should get new ones.  I think I got them
with the bus.

--------&gt;this is the bad part:

  The bolts on the coupler to the shift linkage were ON TOP!   what a pain,
no access, and I finally got a wrench in there (small fingers are useful) and
was not able to loosen it.

so I drained the tranny oil, and jacked the back of the bus up off the ground
and set  it on a big block o' wood and took the rear wheels off and stuck
them under the bus and plugged the tranny and drained one RGBox while
dissasembling the brakes on the other side.  One side was oozing fluid, but
not into the brakes  :).   Both drums slide off nice, thanks to being
greased.   Rear brakes shoes marginal one side.  The one parking brake cable
was tighter than the other.   Think I'll replace the brake hoses too, as they
are circa 5 years old.    Line wrecnches are nice for taking them off.
plugged up  the one RGB and drained the other, took the other brakes off,
backing plate and all.   Opps-  now loosened the big 27mm bolts.

Decided to undo all the shift linkage, I have those NOS bushings that will go
in there.   The connection between the front and rear parts on a 61 has two
screws, the front one was broken off, the rear one missing.   Joy.   sprayed
with liquid wrench.  wiggled, nope, in there tight.   will get out torch
later for hot  and cold shock treatment.

Maybe pull trans back attached to rear shift rod and then undo the coupler?
Any comments?    I do not have any spare early shift rods.   It's all messed
up.  Last resort I could cut through the hockey stick I suppose.   Don't
really feel like cutting a hole in the floor of the bus.

Took the shift stick off, and tried to undo the front to rear linkage again.
More liquid wrench.

Maybe I'll just re do this bus.   Maybe I like working on a bus more than
driving it.  Maybe I'll cut the rust out and weld in new metal.  Maybe pigs
fly.  Funny how you end up finding wierd things wrong with a bus you though
was good.   I think I should do a inspection on all those things more often.
   Shift linkage bolt gone.  jeez.     You know, I think I'll pull  another
tranny soon.
