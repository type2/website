I'm posting this to both air-cooled lists as an inspiration to everyone to
actually drive and enjoy your busses.

I just got back Tuesday from doing a leg of Furthur Tour (ex Grateful Dead
members) in my '67 camper. We did a tad over 3300 miles in 12 days, on a 1600
single port engine. That's a lot of driving, and we didn't really have a single
problem. The only minor hang up was changing out the crusty old voltage
regulator that came with the bus. I left it in since it was still working, but
I had a Bosch spare just in case.
  Let me once again extol the virtues of carrying spare parts. Having that
regulator was the difference between an easy 20 minute fix, and a miserable
overnight wait for parts in a strange city, which some other folks had to do.
We met a lot of sick busses along the way, and did what we could to help them,
but there were some that were too far gone.
   Let me also encourage those of you considering installing a late-model pop
top to do so. Having that extra double bed was wonderful, and made for a very
comfortable trip for 4 people and a bunch of stuff..
   Anyway, this tour took us from Charlotte, NC, up through DC, and then
several stops in the NY/NJ area, and up to Massachussets for a show. It was my
first time driving up north, and it was quite an experience in itself. There's
nothing quite like driving through the Bronx and the greater NYC area in a
splitty. I'll just say it was quite an adventure trying to keep up with all the
merges and such, and not get eaten alive by all the tractor-trailers flying all
around.
I pretty much stuck to night driving, as the traffic is a LOT lighter, and the
air is cooler as well, which makes the bus happier. We did have the pleasure of
driving into 4 sunrises, which are always visually pleasing, if your eyes are
still open at that time...
   We mostly stayed at truck stops and service areas, although we did stay at a
friend's sister's house for 2 nights. Never had any problems with getting
hassled by The Man or anyone else, and it was always nice to have food and gas
right there first thing in the morning...
  There were a LOT of Vanagons on tour this year. I guess they're holding up
pretty well. Plenty of late models as well, although mostly of the type IV
variety. There was another 67 that did a few shows, and we also saw isolated
splitties at various shows. One high point was seeing two other Travel
Equipment Corporation '67 conversions. That's the same company out of Elkhart,
Indiana that originally converted my bus. That makes 4 now that I've seen. 3
were walkthrough's, and the 4th looked like the Elkhart factory might have
converted it back in the day. They did a pretty decent conversion, although I
have switched most of my interior over to Westy stuff...
  There's a LOT of money in the north east...We saw tons of new, expensive
cars, as well as at least 2 New Beetles a day, as opposed to seeing like 4
total here in NC. We saw a couple Eurovans at some of the ritzier venues, as
well as some radio station in Mass. had a pimped-out Rialto EV as their station
vehicle...crazy. Of course all that money meant people were buying a lot in the
parking lots, so I can't complain too much...
  Anyway, we got around 20 mpg for most of the trip, which isn't bad with 4
people plus stuff. I did an oil change and tune-up right before we left, and at
a truck stop at 1500 miles. I was pleased to see that the valves were all still
right on, except for 2 exhaust valves which were a hair loose.
   That's pretty much the bus side of it. We had a great time, and had no
problem keeping up with Tour in a Splitty. We got passed on the road by the
tour busses a couple times, and honked and waved. So, don't doubt the wonderful
busses.BUT, MAKE ABSOLUTELY SURE YOUR BUS CAN DO IT. Don't leave on a long trip
with a bus that's sketchy. We talked to at least 2 people that killed their
busses this tour. I'm sure there are more, who just don't take care of the
busses. Remember, your bus can do it, but it's not a Toyota, so don't do 80 all
day and expect things to be fine...
  I won't go into the music too much except to say that it was GREAT! I highly
recommend that you check out the Furthur Festival if it comes by. The Bus is
rollin again, and Phil's drivin this time! Wahoo! St. Stephen! the Eleven! Dark
Star!!!!! The magic is coming back...
:)
Anyway, have a beautiful weekend, and love your bus!
