Hey!  I made it back from the KCMO area about 5 minutes ago.  I haven't used
a computer in a week solid - WOW!  1000+ list mails await my scrutiny too.
Anyway, Dan Kinsey housed me and fed me for the entire time I was in
Independence - the hospitality was absolutely outstanding and the whole
family treated me as if I was a member and not a black sheep in overalls and
a headband.  I got to ride in Dan's 58 Binz (it is _THE_ ride) and see his
amazing parts stash (some of which I carted home.)  I'm so pround of Dan
too - he's going to be a librarian when he moves down to Florida. :-)
I will have a the full write up in the days to come but I wanted to keep
those that care posted on the latest NQ happenings.




Later...
