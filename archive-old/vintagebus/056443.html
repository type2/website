Importance: Normal
Subject: Creaking sound from drivers rear suspension.

Upon suspension articulation, such as turning and acedning a steep hill
at a stolight, the driver side of my bus creaks some, like the torsion
arm/bar is flexing audibly almost. No noises from tunring noramlly, so I
doubt the trans (also is new) is suspect. Is this the norm, or what
should I check first off? Bus is due to get rear nuts checked, spring
plate bolts checked fine yesterday, and I must tighten my lower shock
bolts some.
