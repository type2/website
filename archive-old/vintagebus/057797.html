Subject: BYOB, listees, Tent poles

I'm all for a listee picture / meeting at BYOB. I never seem to make
these pictures 'cause I'm selling, can someone &amp; *please* come and get
me when this is going to happen?? I'll be in the DD EZ camper selling
shirts, Bus stuff, and whatever else.

For those of you that were interested I'll have my prototype set of
Westy tent poles there as well. Stop by have a look and give me your
input.............

Hoping to put some faces with some names this weekend,

Greg
