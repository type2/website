Subject: Complete wiring harness install on a 67-How hard, where from?

John,

I have done all 4 of my bus's.  I always bought direct
from Bob although i do think that he suplies everyone
else who sells these.

His kits are GREAT.  1st class.  If you buy the right
kit you should have no issues.  You will also want to
get a color wire diagram to help you out.  (i think
vintagebus_dot_com has that)

My only advise would be to take a video or pictures of
the old harness before you remove it and draw some
sketches of the back side of each switch before you
take the wires off.  That way you at least know what
it was before you took it out.  My first one took a
few days but mostly because i did a few things wrong. 
My last one took about 4 hours.

Good luck.
Matthew
