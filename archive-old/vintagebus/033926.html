 i heard that the 63 rear end was one year only.  I thought what i heard
 was that it was small nut, but the stub axle the drum sits on is slightly
 longer than normal, and the brake drum has a longer splined area to
 compensate.
  &gt;&gt;
the optional 215 or is it M216?   stub axle yes is longer.  But have driven a 
bus with one of those and one normal- the only difference is that the side 
wioth the longer stub axle got thick washers under th eaxle nut.  hm- but 
some people may really want the optional stub axles
