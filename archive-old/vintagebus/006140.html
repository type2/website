Has anyone recently replaced or removed the panel over the driver and
passenger area?  I started on the Panel today and would bet these will be
the hardest to duplicate.  Anyone have a pattern they's sell me or willing
to make me a pattern?  I figure the back area shouldn't be to hard just keep
guessing with scrap pieces.  However I'd be willing to buy a pattern of
those to.

Dave
