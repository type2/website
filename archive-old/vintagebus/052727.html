Subject: Re: [VB] Re:[VB] Early bus VIN number question

Body numbers are off from the VINs, especially in special orders like sunroof 
standards.   In generic production bus like a straight micro or truck, 
thenumbers are close.    Another possibility is numbers may have been 
swapped, isn't a sunroof standards a type 28 instead of a type 22?   Funny 
business, hm?   Maybe this explains the shift rod tube under he bus, when the 
vin says it is earlier than shift rod tubes.  VIN plates supposedly showed up 
around chassis # 398 xxx, but I swear on a stack of bibles that the 59 panel 
turned camper that was my first splitty was 50K buses later and had a body 
number - no M code plate, dunno why.   This in spite of the NEATO M code 
registry showing  buses back to about 400,000 having M codes.

Model year was introduced for the 56 models, I believe
55s had a 20- or 1- before the vin (for bus or bug respectively) even the 
post barndoor buses

 Thom's site says this bus was built in October of 1957 for the 1957 model
 year and that a &quot;correction&quot; in the database was suggested.  While doing
 bodywork, the stampings on the panels are dated august 56.  There is no M
 code plate which I believe was used in '58.  I guess my other question here
 is, what year did VW start using the &quot;model year&quot; as opposed to a
 january-january year? Could this bus have been a special-order model '57
 which took a bit longer to produce hence the '58 registration?
