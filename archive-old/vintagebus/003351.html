Yeah, that's what I heard. It's only a couple of models:

 &quot;There's no recall, but until we have more information from Firestone, the responsible thing to do is to discontinue sales,&quot; Sears spokesman Tom Nicholson said Thursday.
Beginning Friday, Firestone's ATX, ATX II and Wilderness tires will no longer be sold at 780 Sears Auto Centers or the 350 National Tire &amp; Battery shops.

&gt; &gt; The Firestone
&gt; 
&gt; [snip]
&gt; 
&gt; For what it's worth, I heard on the news this morning that Sears has dropped
&gt; the Firestone line due to an excessively high accident rate being attributed
&gt; to them failing. Of course the fact I heard it on the news doesn't make it
&gt; true, but I'm just passing it on. I personally despise Firestones for desert
&gt; heat. They can't handle it. Everyone I've ever owned grenaded or separated
&gt; in very short order, Never actually had one last long enough to have any
&gt; tread wear, so I can't speak to how well they last otherwise.
