Subject: RE: [VB] Turn signal switch part 2

I had the same problem, although not as extreme. My switch had a *bit*
of play in it, which I was able to take up with some tape. I used black
2&quot; cloth tape and it blends with both the switch housing and the column.

Subject: [VB] Turn signal switch part 2


Well, I've got my switch rebuilt and looking nice...we'll see how well
it operates.  My next question is, how does it clamp to the steering
column, is the a bushing of some kind that goes between the switch and
the column? When I screw both halves together around the steering
column, it's too big to stay up, it just flops down to the brace.  What
gives?
