hey kids,
thanks to everybody who reponded to my roof rack question. sorry i haven't
made many posts lately. i'm way behind on reading them all (i'm still on
Sept. 29th). anyway, i just wanted to tell everyone that
http://www.vwdormobile_dot_com is officially up and running! i did this with
virtual hosting. has anyone else done this? it's pretty cool stuff. ok,
prepare yourself.

                        ****SHAMELESS PLUG****
if you need a website and like the style of vwdormobile_dot_com, check out my
company's website at http://www.3chip_dot_com to see what else we can do. i'd
love to do some VW sites. right up my alley.
                ****SHAMELESS END TO SHAMELESS PLUG****

if any of you have any links or pictures or articles you want to put up,
drop me an email. I want this to be kind of a shared website among bus
owners as well as other makes and  models of dormobiles. thanks a lot for
reading.

p.s.- my email address is NOT casey_at_yahoo_dot_com. so, if you respond to this,
make sure you change it to casey_at_3chip_dot_com. I have to figure out how to fix
this.
