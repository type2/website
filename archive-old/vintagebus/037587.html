Subject: TriBracket/Re: [VB] What color is mango?
To: rexrogers_at_type2guy_dot_com, vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

Mango is the lower colour , and dash of

http://www.classicvws_dot_com/sale/mango.htm

upper colour is seagull grey.  These 59-61 buses came with caramel seat with 
white piping, like the middle seat in Isiah's 62, if you scroll down you see 
the interior, and even the motor, which has a Triangle Bracket, that looks to 
me as homemade, though tidy.
