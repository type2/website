Jon:

Without going into a lot of qualifying statements about my lengthy VW
ownership, good looks, regular church attendance, etc., let me offer a piece
of advice.

Those air scoops that go over the air intakes *seem* to work pretty well at
highway speeds. Use duct tape to attach them. It works.

Since I started tis thread, I've gotten a lot of feedback from you all and I
appreciate it.
Many of you have these great engines that you know every second of run time
on.  Full-flowed, type 4 coolers and big fans.  Great, my problem is, I have
an older engine of unknown size ( should be a 1600 but.....),mileage, fan
size, stock doghouse cooler, yada, yada, yada.
In other words, an unknown quanity.
Now some of you may see my concern about a 1000mi trip in 110+ temps.

Before any of you suggest tearing down to check things, making modifications
et al.  I live in an apartment right now where I CAN'T work on the van at
this time.
I have a few places I can and do do work on the van but, I have to confine
it to things I can do in a day.  If any of you have any ideas on what I can
do in a few hours to help me feel more comfortable on the trip ( other than
a tune up and changing oil), please feel free to suggest.

Thanks again,

Jon
