Well, I finally went out and paid for that '61 15-window that I wrote
about probably a year ago.  It's missing a lot of stuff so look forward to
me writing the list bugging people for stuff :-)  One cool thing that was
in the parcel tray was the original VW dealer &quot;credit card&quot; with the
original owner's name and address, the VIN# and of course all the info of
the dealership where it was sold.  This is the first one of these that I
have recieved with any of the vehicles that I've owned, so it's cool!  Pix
to come soon.  My folks just got a digital camera, so I have to break it
in for them!
