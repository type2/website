Subject: muffler identification

[...]
Hi 
A friend bought a muffler off the dreaded auction site .. and it isn't what was
advertized..
The question is? What is it for,,
I have not seen it,, but it seems to have threaded connections ,, like a pipe
thread,

It also has part numbers written on it,
Can anyone Identify this muffler?
