Subject: SO-23 Double Fuse Box Question

SO-23 Brethren:

Can anyone out there that has an unmolested double fuse box in their
engine compartment (the one that serves the clam shells and water tank
pump) please send me an upclose picture of it.  I had the foresight to
take a pic of mine before removing it for paint, but one of the wires was
disconnected so I want to make sure and get it right.  In particular I
need to know if there is a jumper wire connecting the clam shell fuse to
the pump fuse, so a close-up pic of the block with the cover off should
give me the answers I need.

TIA.

Robert
