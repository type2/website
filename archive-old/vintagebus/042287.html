Bob....

This is the silver box that sits just in front of the steering column, in
front othe kick panel, right?

I looked into this a bit ago, (and everytime my 6v gen stops working, I
look again.. and found that the 68, 69, maybe 70 box is identical to this
one, except that it is 12v.  all the wires are the same, and go to the
same places.  (love thos wiring digrams to lay next to each other!:)

The headlight relay is also the same, from those busses.

Gotta keep those so-44's on the road!

later...david
