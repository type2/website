 Reason I ask: I fixed my starting problem by replacing the electrical portion
 of my locking steering column with my spare; I don't need to use a quarter to
 short the connections anymore to start it.  I think I may be able to fix the
 old one because it was not &quot;broken&quot; exactly.  Its problem is simply that it 
 wants to turn a hair farther before completing the circuit than the tumbler 
 wants to let it go.  I used to get it to work by installing it slightly 
canted
 in the hole.  When that stopped working I applied some pressure to it and it
 would work.  When that stopped working I used the quarter :-)
 
 So how about it, anybody had one open before?  I'm thinking of giving it a 
 shot.  They seem really simple from the outside...

============
I had the same issue with the steering lock in my 65 westy.  and swapped out 
the electrical portion for one out of a pre 68 bug steering lock , which 
seemed the same. I tried the electrical bit out of the bus with l;ight bulbs 
and battery charger, and the old one worke, but like you said, it just needed 
to turn a tad fuirther.   the switch in the bus fits a piece in the 
electrical portion, I was thinking about wodging something between to take up 
the slop, and make it turn that crucial hair more.   but opening it up makes 
sense too, post what you find.
