Hi all,

Somebody, on the list (if memory serves, it was Noquarter) was looking
for the 15 inch rims versus the 14 inchers that everybody has out
there.  I just got back from the Pomona Swap meet, where I struck a deal
with a couple guys for four rims in pretty good shape for $50 bucks.  If
you aren't in the So cal area and want me to look for anything at the
next one (June 6) drop me a line.  I would like to get a fifth rim for
the spare, and it will be easier to get two than one, so if the rim
search is still on drop me a line.

Later,
Aaron
