yes, and you tell tell it's summer when the rain is warmer.

okay- obligatory bus content...

anyone got an extra 65 wiper motor handy?  A friend of mine is getting his 65
hardtop deluxe together and, among other things, the wiper motor don't work.
 One of the pivots is broken too.   I think the Rainex only will get old
after a day (okay it's already old).  May have to see how fitting an older
style motor works.

ps if you live near/in Oly, consult with people before you take your VW to
Folkswagen, I have heard a lot of unhappy stories that would maybe make you
reconsider.  Actually I think they are out of business now, but they may pop
up again.
