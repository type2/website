Subject: Re: [VB] Excess oil pressure

I am currently running 40 wt. oil, and yes, the weather has cooled a little.
The problem has progressed, it started with the pressure building to around
80 psi, then it would drop suddenly (presumably when the relief popped
open). Now, it doesn't drop, it just keeps building. Driving home on
Saturday I had to keep my speed to about 55 mph (how ironic!) to keep the
pressure below 80. It is time to change to 30 wt. oil, but I don't think
that's the whole answer.

Thanks to everyone for the input.

Craig

&gt;  I have recently noticed that Rosie's oil pressure is way too high (above
80
&gt;  psi) at highway speeds. I suspect that one or both of the pressure relief
&gt;  pistons are stuck. I could use some coaching on removing and checking
them
&gt;  out. All suggestions welcome.
&gt;   &gt;&gt;
&gt; what  weight oil are you using?   I use a heavier oil in summer than
winter,
&gt; but if it gets cool before the regular scheduled oil change the oil
pressure
&gt; gets high, so I swap to a thinner oil.
&gt;
&gt; checker pressure relief valves is simple.   You shimmy under the engine,
and
&gt; look for the one or two big screwed plugs under there- in dual relief one
is
&gt; forward the other aft.  I put the vise grips on the real wide fat
screwdriver
&gt; to undo them, and an oil bucker with help catch the drips and springs.
Not
&gt; much oil comes out, but some does.  *-O
