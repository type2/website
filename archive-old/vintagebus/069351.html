Subject: Re: What H4's is everyone using...

I am using the real Hella H4's. If you are careful and look you can pick
them up for 5-10 bucks a piece at swap meets. I have slightly larger
wires and clean connections but no relays. I have run 90/130's for
years. I now run the 80/100's because the bulbs seem to last longer. I
have had the lights in my double cab for over 5 years now with no
problems on the original switch. This is with lots of night driving on
high. Would I recommend not using relays? No. There is no reason not to.
They will provide more power to your lights and should be more reliable
(better longevity). Can you do it without relays? In my Double Cab it
has worked. I don't know about your bus there are plenty of very
knowledgeable people who say it won't work. The extra safety of the
lights is well worth whatever effort it takes.
