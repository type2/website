Mohammad, List, 
Can anyone help Mohammad out?:
&gt; Hi,
&gt;  From looking at your wesite, I see that you are interested in busses.
&gt;  Well, as our freshmen design project at Drexel University, we are
&gt;  working on designing electric busses, that can be recharged using solar
&gt;  power. Since you seam to have intrest in  this topic, i was wondering if
&gt;  you  can send us any useful information (such as names of companys that
&gt;  you think may be working on similar projects). We appreciate any
&gt;  assistance you can provide us with.
&gt;  Thank you
&gt;  Mohammad Haghkar

There use to be a web site of an electric conversion bus at:
http://www.geo.arizona_dot_edu/home/sacct/jlegrand/webpage/jon.html
but it is gone and the webmaster says this student has moved on with no 
contact.

Also, there is an electric VW Thing owned by Harry.Houck_at_ci.fresno_dot_ca_dot_us. 

Sorry I am not more help, Tom
