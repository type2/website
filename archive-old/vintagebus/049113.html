Subject: Westy Panelling - Is it Really Birch?

The boss was out of town yesterday, so me and a buddy decided to play hooky and head down to the City of Angels (Los Angeles) in search of the perfect birch panelling for the '59 Westfalia.  Some previous phone leg work had been done so we had narrowed down our points of interest to one - Veneer Products of L.A.

We arrived to find a huge operation, probably 10,000 square feet in an industrial area.  This was not a pretty, retail showroom that the common person off the street would walk into to find some panelling for their kids bedroom.  It was an manufacturing plant that strictly produces venner products, wholesale.  They actually MAKE veneer, i.e. take the paper thin sheets and adhere them to the backing board.  Since said friend is a licensed contractor, we waltzed right in.

I took with me one of the virgin panels that is located behind either of the two rear cabinets up on the rear deck in the camper.  The curved piece that never sees the light of day.  We sat down with the guy I had spoken to on the phone, he took one look at the panel, and immediately said &quot;This isn't birch.&quot;  WHAT??????  I told him &quot;every VW person on the face of the planet claims this is baltic birch, who are you to tell us it isn't?  Afterall, we're VW experts, we know these things.&quot;  He said you're wrong , this is Polynesian mahogany.  Oh come on, mahogany is red, this is yellow.  Back and forth we went, he still felt positive it was polynesian mahogany, no doubt about it.  He actually said it was a luwan (sp?).  I proceeded to tell him about old growth trees, winter grains, etc.  He looked at me like I was full of sh*t.

Well of course now I'm at a complete loss.  So let's assume it's polynesian mahogany.  Can I see some of that?  He said no because they no longer make it in the 1/8&quot; (3mm) thickness, 1/4&quot; is the thinnest.  He said it's readily available panelling, try calling around and you might be able to find some.  So I asked him what he had that would most closely resemble what I think is my birch.  We walked back into one corner of the warehouse, where he proceeded to pull out a veneer I called avodirez.  It's an exotic wood found in Africa.  The stuff was dead on.  The perfect color, the perfect grain, it was perfect.  The catch, it's very expensive.  About 8 times what you can get birch for.  The clincher tho is he can produce it in whatever lengths I want with the grain running whichever direction I want.  Long panel on the drivers side with the grain running vertically, no problem.

So, I'm mulling it over trying to figure out what to do.  Baltic birch is nice and cheap, but the grain patterns on modern cut panelling don't even look anything like original panelling.  Avodirez (sp?) is dead on but would cost over $700 to do the panelling in the camper.

So, have we all been under the wrong impression all of these years.  Or is this guy smokin' crack and clueless on old veneer?  Let's not forget veneer is his business, he had more types of veneer in his warehouse than you could count.  ???????????
