&gt; What was their rationale behind no larger than 25x25?  It looks like its in 
&gt; the back of your property and not obtrusive, what if you wanted to make it 
&gt; a three car wide?

Local zoning sez it can't be more than 1/2 the size of the conditioned
living space in the house.

&gt; Are you going to install that lift we saw a month ago in your 
&gt; driveway?  That recessed mounting is a nice touch.

yup.  the tube you see in the pix will carry the hydraulic lines, and I'll
mount the pump to the wall.
