The lighter in my 66 deluxe is also just left of the ashtray. It has a VW
knob that is exactly like the others on the dash. I was looking at an old
sundial today, and it too has a lighter in the dash in the same spot but is
missing the lighter itself. Looks to me to be a dealer option on both; a
very clean install!

&gt; With the talk about cigarette lighters, thought I'd add a comment. My
&gt; '65 Standard has one located just to the left of the ashtray. It's a 6
&gt; volt'er made in the USA with a screw on VW knob. At first I thought it
&gt; was a hack job, but after removing it, I'm beginning to think it was
&gt; probably a dealer installation. The hole for the socket was either
&gt; drilled real cleanly or the hole was punched. Then, someone took the
&gt; time to spray the hole with matching paint. Judging by the overall look,
&gt; it was done years ago. I was going to fill this hole in, but now I'm
&gt; beginning to doubt it.
&gt;
&gt; So my question to those of you that have lighters installed, is where
&gt; are they placed? Any others to the left of the ashtray?
&gt;
&gt; Thanks,
