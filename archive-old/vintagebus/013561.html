&gt;You love the Volkswagen, but it doesn't rule your life...
&gt;
&gt;Hahahaha! I suspect testing error!
&gt;The test needs other questions.

Background... before answering the quiz:

My living room is adorned with VW parafanalia... 4 foot VW logo over the mantle, 12 trophies &amp; plaques for slow drags or Best Double         Cab (whenever I was the only double at the show), cheap VW raffle posters,  an engine block and heads sitting next to the computer desk (for design purposes of course),  bus emblems and bug hood ornaments, and of course, all my camping gear sitting in the hallway, to walk around between events....

&gt;Example:
&gt;1.&gt;Do you shop at used clothing stores for crappy looking Hawaiian shirts 
&gt;and skanky looking shorts so you can save up for your next engine rebuild?
&gt;~ even though all ten of your VWs have fresh engines?
&gt;~ and a few spare core motors on the shelf?

I do shop at thrift stores, but only buy quality used jeans, name brand shorts, and golf shirts....  the money I save, however, usually goes directly into the Type II maintainance fund.

&gt;2.&gt;Do you drive with pistol shooter's ear plugs to deaden the sound because 
&gt;you are too damned busy to reinstall the interior in your EZ camper?
&gt;~ the camper was painted LAST Christmas.

No... but I do stuff all the doors and windows with cardboard when I make the trip to the hot springs.  Someday I'll recycle the rubber on my double cab and make a pair of slicks for one of my slot cars.  My primer is good for approx. 2 years....

&gt;3.&gt;Are you so sick in the head that you have used up all of your vacation 
&gt;days on travel to out of State VW shows?
&gt;~AND only three quarters of the year has passed?
&gt;~AND the Arizona show season is just starting?
&gt;~AND you are eye-balling your accrued sick time?

Vacation? Sick time?  Whats that....  I will, however, jeapordize my job and/or give up overtime to make it to an event on Friday...  and         double the money I've lost buying extra beer for the extra event day.

&gt;4.&gt;You threaten to name your children, not after family names, but instead 
&gt;choose vehicle makes/models? &lt;Catera, Sierra, Van, Vanna, Wes T., Judson, 
&gt;Mercedes, Truck, Edsel, Porsche, Moon Unit or Rover?&gt;
&gt;~OR auto related namesaskes? &lt;Ferry, Ben Pon, Enzo, Gene Berg, Hoover Bit, 
&gt;Kelly Park, Pomona, Irvine or Deano&gt;
&gt;~AND your spouse agrees... ;-)
&gt;-ellis\

My kids were spared...  in the naming game...  although they are all teenagers and want VW's for their first cars.  They have not been spared, however of being raised as Bubblehead children...  learning to 'drive' with a toy steering wheel on the left side of my right hand drive bug, serious bruises and ocasional emrgency room trips, due to serious 'Slug Bug' competition, selling off CD's and clothes to buy Jerome Raffle Bus tickets,  trained proffessionals at setting up camp at VW events,....
