Idea would be 67 and earlier on the buses and bugs, 69 and earlier on the 
ghias and type 3's. No things, no 411s, no 412s, no Audis, NO NEW BEETLES. 
And they are not enforcing who has to park outside, just who parks inside.

 everything would be fine.
 
 I think if they make people park outside the show, they better have security
 to watch over the vehicles.
