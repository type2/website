I'm too lazy to send four posts and don't think Thom will miss the   additional traffic, so here's a few totally unrelated items.....

 I rescued Trundle (a '66) as a shell full of part laden milk crates   about two years ago. We've been on the road together for the past two or   three months with few hassles. The longer I'm on the road, the more I   love it. Even my SO, and especially my kids, are falling under the spell   as we rack up our leisurely miles.

Wipers-
 Trundle is my first bus and the learning curve has been fairly steep. I   find myself really enjoying the purity of function this machine   represents. No fluff here, nothing dressy. This strait forward design has   eased most aspects of the revival, but I'm having a problem with    mounting the wiper motor assembly. It seems like the correct orientation   should be painfully obvious yet I'm stumped. Most of the parts that came   with the bus were 12 volt and I've made the assumption that the motor is   too because of it's slow speed (is the speed of an electric motor   dictated by voltage or amperage?). The wiper motor is mounted to a   stamped, triangular frame with each wiper shaft and the motor shaft at   it's points.

 I've mounted the assembly with the motor shaft point up and down, but   neither seems correct. It's mounted pointing down at the moment. I   deduced this is not right because the rotating rods connected to the   motor move through space where the ashtray should be. Also, I can't find   anyplace to secure the motor (it's tied through the speaker grill right   now). If I mount it upside down, it occupies radio space. In my search   for an answer, I've only seen a setup where no frame is used at all, and   the movement takes place forward of the heater pipe (FIF). I've spent   hours trying to squeeze the frame between the nose skin and the heater   pipe without success. Maybe this is out of a post 68?

 So I'm stuck. Right now it's in and working, but it's not right. Does   anybody have this type of framed configuration? Will this work, or should   I begin cruising the shows for a 67 motor and ancillaries?

Speedo's -
 Trundle's engine was pilfered from my ex-super beetle (74). I thought it   would be great to mount the speedo/gas gauge in the bus, but it wouldn't   fit. Are the Speedos in supers and bugs different sizes? I would still   like to do this and free the other opening for a temp gauge. What should   I expect to shell out for one of the units that fit in the existing   opening?

Rant -
 Geez, I wish everyone would include their geographic location in sale   posts.

Trips-
 Is anybody in the Atlanta area headed to Boone on the 24th? We're   planning on going. This will be the first long trip with Trundle and I'm   getting jazzed. I didn't see anything about reservations and it's likely   too late to ask, but, do we need 'em?

TIA and sorry for being so long winded...
