Sounds like you got shafted.  You need a totally different handle for the
forward cargo door.  The mount for the inside handle is connected via
that square shaft to the outside handle.

Non walk-thru panels had their own short shaft, as it was deemed unecessary
to be able to open the bus from the inside.  Everything else had the normal
long shaft.

&gt; OK I have a flush shaft mechansim, So what you are saying I need an outside 
&gt; handle to work the mechansim from the inside?  Where can I get an handle 
&gt; like this?  This is going on a 66 Westy
