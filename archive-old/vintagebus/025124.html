how worn are the pedals?  this is by far the easiest way to tell a high
milage car without getting dirty from crawling under and around it.  :)

&gt; I need some help on determining if my '62 has 65000 or 165000.  What are some
&gt; of the things I need to look for to tell whether or not it is original?  No
&gt; engine so I couldn't decide from that....Everything else is in actually good
&gt; condition..It's set up since '80(derived from the date on license plate
&gt; tags).  Anyhelp is greatly appreciated!
