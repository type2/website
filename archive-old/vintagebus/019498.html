Hi Renoir here,
71 1600

I replace my half shafts complete with cvs from a 69 no problem, thanks list.

But i did notice some scoring, a ridge, circular, about 1-1/2&quot; long on the
drivers side cup. The tranny side was clean and smooth.

Now, i have an occasional click, especially after going in reverse.
I take it the cups should be smooth?

Would it be better to take off the shafts again and grind or sand down the
ridge as best i can?
Leave it alone?

comments appreciated.
Jokes allowed.

thank you!
