Yeah, they pretty much suck.
I run one on the okrasa motor, but just because it looks cool!
I dont think it actually does anything!

&lt;&lt;Hi Pete,
Definitely too much time....  The problem with this type of filter system is 
that it hardly cleans the oil.  It is not a full flow system.  Instead it 
filters a trickle of oil though it and allows plenty of metal shavings to 
continue through the bearings as the stock system always does.  Eric&amp;Barb
