&lt;&lt; O.K......and what kind of welder do I need to buy? MIG? Any 
suggestions......
 Think I can do this??? &gt;&gt;
Hi Greg,
Lincoln or Miller are the best inexpensive brands.  Get MIG/TIG with gas and 
check that later you can install spot welding capibility later.  Really wish 
we had done this last bit of investigation, but still are getting tons of 
stuff fixed/done.  Eric&amp;Barb
