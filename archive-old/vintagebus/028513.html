Subject: the new 62

Hey y'all!
My new 62 bus is finally sitting in my driveway after 3-4 months of
saving up the dough for it.  I've already written about it a few times
so I'll spare you another write up.
I did find some cool things in it though.  It had the original owners
manual, and about an 8&quot;x10&quot; picture of a cutaway view of a bus.  very
cool.  It also had the service booklet with only 2 pages left.  another
little booklet I found was a &quot;just a few tips&quot; booklet.  Its a yellow
fold out booklet that folds out to be about 2 feet long...its bus
specific and its indexed.  hard to explain.  I've heard about them for
beetles...but was talking to a few other people last night and they say
they've never heard of a bus one.  I snapped a picture of it with my
horrible camera and posted it at
http://www.luckyboys_dot_com/isaiah/booklet.htm

I think I'm going to go to Kinkos and see if they can't copy it for me.
I want to scan the booklet in...and i should be doing that within the
next few days.  cool little booklet that gives driving tips and how to
do things with the bus.  super cool item with neat little drawings.  if
anyone has any more info on these...please let me know.  its dated 8/61.

i drove the 62 around last night...what a blast!  I have a hard time
cramming myself in there though.... and I'm only 6'3&quot;!!
good thing i have that adjustable front seat ;-)


ahhhh....life is grand.

out to fix some oil leaks on the bus...

adios
