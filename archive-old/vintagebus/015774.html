Hey all, I've posted a couple things to vintagebus but
they don't seem to be going through...I'll try one
more time here..Anyway, after having a bay
window..I've finally moved up to a splitty!! I love it
more each day. I was hoping to take &quot;GHOST&quot; to it's
first VW event(Everybus 2000) but a wedding party has
gotten in the way....so maybe I'll be able to hit the
next one.

Also, I really need a roof rack for my bus but
everyone I come accross is way to expensive. So, if
anyone has one that they are going to sell for cheap
please let me know...I can't afford a lot but I will
guarantee a lot of use and well taken care of.

Anyway, View pics of my 67 and my girlfriends 76 at
the link below...and if you have a Bus homepage send
me the address and I'll link it to my page. 

Take Care,

Greg
