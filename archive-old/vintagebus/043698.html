&gt;My turn signals themselves work fine, but the little indicator light
&gt;on the speedometer is giving me grief. It glows with the ignition off.
&gt;I think the trouble is in the relay, which I have only a limited
&gt;understanding of. X and L terminals I dig, but what is this P terminal
&gt;all about? 

Sounds like an aftermarket 3-terminal flasher.

 X is the connection to the battery
 L is the connection (through the turn signal switch) to the turn signal
   lamps
 P is the Pilot light connection

These flashers are usually designed for the pilot lamp to be connected
between P and ground.  The P terminal powers the pilot lamp.

The original VW flasher had four terminals:

 + is the connection to the battery
 S is the connection (through the turn signal switch) to the turn signal
   lamps
 K is the pilot light connection
31 ground

The VW flashers were designed for the pilot lamp to be connected between
K and hot-with-key-on voltage.  The K terminal provides a ground to the
pilot lamp.

&gt;And why does there always seem to be a low amount of
&gt;current present at both the L and P terminals? Bad relay? Bad ground?

This is inherent in these flashers.  I bet you measured with a voltmeter
and saw battery voltage on there.  They do leak a little current but
not enough to light the turn signal lamps.  On other cars this isn't
a problem as the turn signals are on the ignition key, so there is
no voltage at all on the flasher with the key off.  On your Bus, though,
the turn signals are on the battery, so the flasher is always powered.
The small leakage current coupled with the sneak ground that the indicator
lamp can find through the gas gauge, generator and oil lights, choke
heater, and (possibly) the coil results in it glowing.

Using an original-style flasher is probably the best way to stop this.
If you have converted to 12 volt, a #559 flasher should also work - it
has the extra ground connection.  Failing that, a diode in the P line
should fix it - it should &quot;point&quot; towards the flasher.

&gt;And the emergency flashers? I'm stumped. It seems that I either need a
&gt;relay or a switch with more terminals in order to flash all four turn
&gt;signals together as emergency flashers but keeping them isolated for
&gt;use as turn signals.

Stock, it should have a relay and a switch.  The switch connects the
two rear light wires and the flasher to flash them; it also powers
a relay that flashes the front two lights off of battery voltage.
See http://www.vintagebus_dot_com/wiring/ and look at items J6 (hazard
flasher switch) and J1 (hazard relay)  The switch and the relay both
are wired as you mention; they keep the left and right sides isolated
from one another until they are turned on.

Good luck!
