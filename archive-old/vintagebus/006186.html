The clouding of Laminated Safety Glass
is caused by water or humidity leeching up
between the two panels and into the flexible
plastic core. This is for the windshield, if
you have seen a cracked or broken one, you
know it will break but not crumble because of
the core material.
The side glass is a different type, it crumbles
on impact into tiny fragments with relatively
dull edges. It has no core material.
If the Laminated glass is installed with a  sealer
( tar works good, or a urethane caulk from professional
glass installer supply ) it will protect the glass from
moisture and prevent leaks thru the seal / glass area.
Old seals willbecome brittle, and the tar will prolong
the sealing effect. The tar ( roofing compound ) will
also be very effective in the seal / body side, and
lubricates the new seal for installation and  cleans
up quite nicely with kerosene, which won't hurt the paint.
