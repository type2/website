Subject: Re: [VB] bus on the highway

I do not think this is a VW only problem 

Many Early American cars have small tailights that cannot be seen, in fact I 
think you can legally have a single tailight on cars before 1946 , surely not 
safe

The lights need to be up high, and removable with maybe a push  in elecrical 
connection (headphone style?)

easy on , easy off

play safe........
