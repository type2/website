Subject: Re: [VB] Splitwindow Windsheild/Windscreen

From: Michael Knight

&gt; I am searching for a Driver's Side window for the front of my '66. Anybody
 out there in Type 2 land that has one laying around please let me know. The
 closer the better to help with shipping. I live in the small town of  Mooresville, NC.
    ------------------------------------------------------------------

I am a little confused by your request:)
1st you say you want a drivers SIDE window.
Then you say ''for the FRONT' of my '66''.
Do you want a front windshield glass or the front door glass?  i.e. the sliding one
If you want the front windshield glass, a glass shop can cut you one. But make sure you have them get the thin
laminated glass stock. Not the thicker standard glass!
