My south african beetle has white reflectors mounted under the front bumper.
No rear ones though.

&lt;&lt;Hey Volks


The reflectors on most of the buses I've photographed round here have

generated some  questions and speculation.


A pair of honeycomb reflectors of a design approved by the SA Bureau of

Standards was required both front (white) and rear (red) on all vehicles in

South Africa. You will find these reflectors on all old buses of any

vintage, as this law existed since before the early 50s and has only fallen

away recently.


It is unlikely these reflectors would have appeared as an M-code, as every

one I have seen has been locally made, and was no doubt VWSA or dealer

installed.
