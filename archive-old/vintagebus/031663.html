Well to start off Corona de Tucson was a great laid back event, beautiful
weather, people and buses. A lot of wheeling dealing happening on some local
Tucson buses, not much swap stuff to be had, but hey, it was a camp-out and
that it was. 

My panel finally had it's first breakdown (after over 40,000 miles), 10
miles out of Havasu I handgernaded my alternator. No warning, just a red
light and no chargeing, checked the engine compartment and the belt was
there, but the alternator shaft would move back and fourth a 1/4 inch or so.
Limped back in to home the last ten miles on the battery, lights on and all,
made it with no problem, except for the rattling from the alt. Will install
a new alternator to be ready for Bug-a-Rama next week, then hope to have the
new 1800 finished built and in for KP weekend.

For those that care I got a really different full length rack in Tucson.
It's a metal rack with a wood slat base, If I remember correctly it has 5
legs on each side and are adjustable, it kind of reminds me of the BD fire
truck racks  that were at the Classic 2 years ago for sale, hope to have it
redone for KP weekend also.
The best find I got was the pole and hanger piece for my 60 Westy hatch-top.
This is the piece that hangs from the cieling and attaches to the front seat
backrest to make it into a bed. It is in perfect condition, with the red
plaid fabric on it, only 3 pieces to go and my Westy is complete.
So, if anybody has 2 interior lamp holders and 1 clamshell lens cover my
Westy will be complete.
