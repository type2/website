Hi Volks,
For those of you who were planning to look for us and our 1960 panel camper at
Sacamento.  We have a close family member who is going into the hospital
friday for some rather serious surgery, so we will not be able to make it to
the show.  We will really miss all the fun of meeting fellow VWers and VW
treasures to be seen and had at Sacramento.  Hopefully we will make it to the
spring Sacramento next year.  Eric &amp; Barb
