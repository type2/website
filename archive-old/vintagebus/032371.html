For all you New England listees, the New Hampshire Volkswagen Club is 
hosting it's annual summer show and swap at the Hopkinton Fairgrounds in 
Hopkinton, NH. Great venue, great VW's. One of the largest all VW events in 
the northeast with 230+ VW's in attendance. 30 classes, trophies and dash 
plaques plus giveaways all day long. For our long distance travellers, 
there is camping on the show field the night before with great shower 
facilities and electric hook ups available. Bonfires and BBQ, so come join 
us early.
Fees are $10.00 for car and driver, $2.00 for spectators with kids under 12 
admitted free. $17.00 for Saturday night campers which includes show 
registration.

Directions are, from routes 93 north or south, take the route 89 north exit 
in Bow Junction, just south of Concord, NH. Follow 89 north 14.4 miles to 
exit 7. Right at end of ramp onto route 103 east. Take your immediate right 
onto Warner rd and 1.5 miles to show field.

The weather is going to be fantastic, so lets have a record turn out for 
this years event.
