Chuck and the List,

Chuck you asked, &quot;The earliest '67 in the NEATO registry is 2x7000597
July 5, 1966 ...Does anyone out there have a earlier 67 then mine?&quot;
That, soon to be no longer the earliest 67 in the NEATO registry, is mine.  
Here is a sum up of this thread: 

Chuck Notmeyer's 67 - July 6, 1966 - number 559
Tom Good's 67 Westy - July 5, 1966 - number 597
Karl's 67 Standard - July 5, 1966 - number 625
David Easterwood's 1967 Dormobile - July 5, 1966 - number 874
David Easterwood's Kombi  -  July 7, 1966 - number 1443


Chuck, you sure on your date? I'm with Harry in Fresno: &quot;Maybe they made up 
tags on Mondays and used them all week.&quot;
