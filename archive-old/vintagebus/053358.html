Subject: Tom Conner Roof racks, total bus height?

I would really like to purchase one of Tom's roof racks soon, a 8 or
full length. I was wondering if anyone out there owns one, and could
tell me how much higher it will make my bus, for storage considerations.
I have an 8 foot garage door entrance, no power opener. Bus is standard
height 66, sitting level on 195/75/14s .
Just the measurement of the highest point of the rack, or the distance
from the top point in the roof to the highest point of the rack would do
nicely.
Thank you,
Al
