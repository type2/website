I dunno... how about a killer pizza in the shape of a bus? Tofu
sculpture? (I'm just not much of a cake person....) I'm flexible, here.

Sounds good to me!


	I'm curious... why &quot;Garcia Bus&quot;???

Why Garcia Bus?  Well actually, when I signed up for the account I wasn't using my name so I decided to set up the account with my bus' information.  His birthday, etc.  I didn't realize that info was displayed with your mails so I will probably go ahead and change it. When I got the bus it had the word Garcia in rainbow glitter stickers on the front of the roof, right above the air intake for the vent.  Some remnants of the letters are still there (I'm careful when I duct tape up the vent and rust holes for the winter that I don't tape over the letters).  Some people think it was put there by a Grateful Dead fan, but it was actually put there by the previous owner, Miguel Garcia, a small quiet hispanic man in West Texas who sold me the bus.  Hope that explains it.  Now if I can just decipher some of the other odities about it that I have found.

Richard

peas,

Jason

&gt; Hey, that is my birthday.  I was always bummed that half the cool rock stars died the year I was born.  We should get a bunch of us March 8th, 1971 bus owners together for a type II birthday bash.  I see a life size bus birthday cake.  What do ya think?
