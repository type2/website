&gt; &gt; Mike West died quite some time ago. He was old and
&gt; very sick. We
&gt; &gt; sleuthed up his obituary one night on IRC (that
&gt; sounds morbid and
&gt; &gt; callous but nobody quite knew what had happened to
&gt; him, and there's
&gt; &gt; really only one way to settle a question like
&gt; that--Raistrick knew he'd
&gt; &gt; been badly ill).
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; He had cancer but I think the cause of death was
&gt; heart failure, he died
&gt; &gt; in a nursing home in Oregon. Some small town near
&gt; Grant's Pass I think.
&gt; &gt; There was nothing to suggest that he left any
&gt; family.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Regretfully,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; --Hoop
&gt; 
&gt; Dang, I had forgotten all about this.  At first I
&gt; thought this was some kind
&gt; of sick joke but regretfully, I do believe you are
&gt; right.  Wasn't Mike the
&gt; guy that wrote those posts that were always narrow
&gt; columned (like they were
&gt; written on a Commodore 64) and full of really short
&gt; sentences?  He just kind
&gt; of appeared on the list and then all of a sudden
&gt; vanished.  I'd sure like to
&gt; know more about Mike because it seemed like he
&gt; really knew his stuff about
&gt; VWs.  I still say we need a memorial site for our
&gt; dearly departed listees
&gt; including Mike West, Scott Yuppa, Josh Rodgers, and
&gt; that one fella whose bus
&gt; was plowed into by a drunk killing everyone in the
&gt; family except him (who
&gt; barely survived himself.)  I've always wanted to put
&gt; up a site like that but
&gt; didn't really have the resources to do one good and
&gt; proper.  Just how would
&gt; one go about doing a site like this?

_at__at__at__at__at__at__at_  Mike West was before my time here on the
list....How long as it been now for me? one week.. two
weeks..one month..two? Time loses all meaning when
your unemployed.I did a search in the archives for
Mike West and found his postings.I looked at some of
them and I look forward to reading more.I know nothing
about VW's but his writing seemed to me to be very
informative along the lines of the well known Jim
Ellis and George Lyle with others on this list (I am
new remember) Well worth the reading...I think NQ has
a good idea.Needs to be a place for those that have
cruised on up the slow lane ahead of us.As Mike West
wrote...Hey,Whould I lie to you guys?
