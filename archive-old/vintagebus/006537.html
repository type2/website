Was there any problems before Ronnie? Did not have enough buyers? needed to
invest large amount of money? It seems though that Schofields &quot;body parts&quot;
are the best on the market.
I don't know, might sure be well worth a try.

&gt; ps. Alans shop is a 3 man operation that does nothing but fab parts 14 or
&gt; more hours a day, as Thom said it is difficult for him to ship small
orders,
&gt; but order a complete bus (in pieces) and he would probably ship it.
