Subject: Re: [VB] Clutch/trans problem

Has any one mentioned the Bowden tube!?   If the clutch arm is Ok and the
cable is new than I bet that the Bowden tube is not getting all the way back
into the dimples that it is supposed to be fitted into.   Just a option to
look at before pulling the motor.

&gt; Well I replaced the clutch cable, with no apparent difference.  The pedal
&gt; is soft, with the only spring action appearing to come from the return
&gt; spring on the clutch lever attached to the trans.  This lever seems to
&gt; travel forward easily, a distance of about 2&quot;, and then seems to to a
&gt; stop. Does that sound right?? Do I need to tighten the clutch cable
&gt; further, until the movement of the lever really begins to resist?
&gt;
&gt; Bob Mon,
&gt;
&gt;   Well, the easy fix of replacing the clutch cable still needs to be
&gt; completed by getting one-half to three-quarters of free play before it
&gt; gets hard to push.  So yes, you do need to tighten the clutch wing nut
&gt; more.  The various techniques have been explained in the archives.  If
&gt; this does not fix the problem, an engine pull may be needed.
