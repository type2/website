An interesting factoid! Go to a wrecking yard Mercedes came with the same
clock, just with a flat bezel, all you have to do is change the bezel.I
bought 2 at Pomona (12 volt) for 5 dollars a piece, checked them and they
both work, so I will switch the movements and have 2 12 volt deluxe clocks
for under 30 dollars. I bought 2 deluxe clocks for 10 bucks a piece a while
ago.

Hi Gene,
The clock mounts in with two brackets on each side.  The pre-1962 clocks you

reach up forward of the dash and adjust.  The post-1961 clocks are adjusted 
through the face crystal.  From what you describe from your clock it is 
missing all the hard to find parts and so is a parts clock for the innards.

You will need to find another clock with all these parts and have one made 
from the two.  Which we do along with cleaning and some cosmetic repair for 
$40.00 including shipping in the USA.
