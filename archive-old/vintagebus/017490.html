well folks, i am off again...back to houston. taking the '65 kombi. I don't
know when I am leaving, but i amtrying tog et out of here on wednesday, school
starts on monday(cutting it a little close)

I am trying to finish the interior of my bus. I have been redoing a lot of it,
it is an ez-camper, and i am basically remaking alot of the panels and
cabinets for the icebox etc. except instead of masonite with a photo of wood
laminated to the surface, I am using baltic birch plywood. This stuff is
pretty nice looking. I also put ina new linoleum floor, laminated to
masonite.
I couls finish this stuff a lot faster if i had more sunlight. I was trying to
put it together ntonight, and it just gets dark too fast, I guess i to get up
with sun.

well i hope to see some listees en route, I don't know my route yet, or exact
departure. at this point all i know is boston and houston, and attempting to
leave within the week.

ciao
