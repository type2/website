Perhaps it might be something to drag into 3D
StudioMax modeling software and use as a template for
a 3D virtual model! (Yeah, like that wouldn't take a
few hours!) Supposedly, my Max teacher already has 3D
models of various Volkswagens. I will advise anyone
who pmails me if and when they become available. Does
anyone already have good, accurate Type I and II 3D
models?

Pls fwd this concept to Joel Walker. I spaced his
email addr.
Sorry if this is a duplicate. I biffed the addresses
in the CC: line...
