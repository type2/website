 Hey,
 I have one of those aftermarket tow hitches that has large U-bolts around
 the torsion bar and two bolts in the bumper, that's the entire mounting.
 Anyone heard of these and if I should bother to put it on. My total trailer
 requirement would be a small utility trailer with 150lb or less tongue
 weight. I have pics.

I got a good idea from Joe's Hitches in Plano, Texas. You figure out the=20
total weight
that you're gonna haul. One VW =3D about 2,000 lbs at most. Add the weight o=
f=20
the trailer, say about 1,000 lbs. The hitch weight rating of your trailer=20
hitch should be the
total weight towed, or 3,000 lbs. The tongue weight (up and down) should be=20
about
10% of the hitch weight, or about 300 lbs. If the tongue weight rating of=20
your trailer hitch  is 450 lbs,, the hitch weight rating should be 4,500 lbs=
.=20
You should be able to haul about 1.5 VWs + a 1,000 lb trailer easily.

I was worried about this. I rigged up a towbar to my New Beetle, which was=20
equipped with a hitch rated at 2,000 lbs hitch weight and 200 lbs. tongue=20
weight (note the
hitch weight/tongue weight ratio; which is how hitches are rated). It pulled=
=20
a 1,500 lb.
Hebm=FCller at speeds up to 75 MPH, using an automatic transmission in the N=
ew=20
Beetle. Couldn't even feel the Hebm=FCller most of the trip. Hadda watch for=
=20
train tracks and large road dips of 45 degrees or more, but came thru fine.

I have one of those hitches about which you speak. Now that I know about=20
hitch ratings, I wont hesitate to haul a VW and a trailer behind my bus.
