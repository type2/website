&gt; I think that there are two different kinds of bolts used on those...

&gt;Our 1960 panel camper, 1962 SO-34 Westie and 1963 SC all use the same
bolts 
&gt;as used on the generator tin to the fan shroud. This bolt size is also

&gt;listed in our bus parts manual though the washer is differant. This
manual 
&gt;also lists N 13 890 2 self tapping hex. screw head 6.3x13, which is 
&gt;apparently for when the bolt holes strip/rust out later.

And then on 26 Aug 2002 15:01:11, &quot;Kevin Guarnotta&quot;
&lt;kguarnotta_at_usa_dot_net&gt; added:

&gt;I am not sure about whether or not the engine tins screws hold this
front
&gt;pedal assembly cover on...but i know on mine it is a combination of
sheet
&gt;metal screws and bolts. for the sheet metal screws-you can see that
the
&gt;metal you are screwing into is too thin to have been threaded for a
bolt.

And I'd clarify that the front and back bolts are just that: 6mm bolts.
 There are capture nuts in the sheet metal (welded on inside the front
apron and the topside of the thin sheet metal at the back of the pedal
cover).  The cooling tin slotted head bolts would work fine there.  I
used a tap to clean out the threads when I worked on mine.

However, along the sides the pedal cover screws to the frame (at the
bottom edge of the &quot;C&quot;) with no capture nuts.  It's thick enough to put
screws in, which I assume to be the self-tapping hex head 6.3x13 screw
sEric&amp;Barb cite.  I have to qualify my observations with &quot;at least on my
'67s it's that way&quot; I don't have my Parts List handy.
