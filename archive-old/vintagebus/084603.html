This thread over squish and CR is great!  I'm now driving a high CR 
super beetle and a formerly low, 6.6-1 CR '67 bus.  The bug motor was a 
&quot;cheap&quot; SIR rebuild circa 1986.  It has never run well on any fuel less 
than 91 octane.  It has the 205M dizzy.  It gets great fuel economy, 30 
in town and 32-36 on the open road.  This engine now has over 85K miles 
on the clock.  The whole car was a deal when I payed only $200 for it in 
'89....I have not broken this engine down yet to determine it's CR and 
so on.

The low CR bus engine recently got a head job and new cylinders, the old 
balanced pistons and rings measured out like new with 35K in the new 
cylinders.  I assembled this motor with a CR of 7.2-1 after the 
6.6-1life.  I added gap less #2 compression ring for the heck.  The 
heads are squishless semi-hemi Berg deals.  I made these changes to 
improve fuel economy and top speed.  So, the results are less dramatic 
than I hoped.  Of course, this motor is not running at 8-1 CR or 
higher.  I now get 22-24 mpg at freeway speeds over 21-22 mpg before 
hand.  The top speed is still around 70 mph.  This is with a genuine 
4.12-1 rear end, stock tire size.  Gene Berg, back in '86, ordered me to 
do the low CR bus engine.  I got 85K trouble free miles out of this 
deal.  I did a rebuild because of valve guide wear.  This engine still 
ran great.  I could drive it WOT all day in any heat.  I trusted it.

The new, higher CR engine has more power driving around 50 mph.  It 
seems to give great mpg driving around 50mph, Over 25 mpg.  Still, it 
does need more ignition advance than higher CR engines.  I'm in single 
port city here.  Split window buses with a good single port motor are 
fun to drive.  Maybe that is where it I'm at....
