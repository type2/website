Hi Chris and everyone,

On Sat, 03 Mar 2001 Chris wrote the following in response to my &quot;Michigan
Vintage VW Festival&quot; update... :

&quot;No offense to the Michigan VW Club, but given all the bad feelings that
VWoA engenders for its nonsupport of its ACVW legacy, and for its
heavy-handed persecution of VW-related Internet sites, it's a wonder
that a chapter of the VVWCA wants to be seen anywhere near their
corporate HQ.  (Typical comment:  They only put up with the old VWs when
it can help them sell New Beetles.)

Just wondering out loud...&quot;

He was refering in part to a section of my original update here below:
 
&gt; Here is the latest update on the Michigan Vintage Volkswagen Club
(Chapter
&gt; of the national VVWCA) &quot;Michigan Vintage Volkswagen Festival&quot; in Auburn
&gt; Hills in May.  This is always a great Midwest VW weekend event, very laid
&gt; back and social, and because of that, many of us travel great lengths in
&gt; our VW's to attend.  This event is held at Volkswagen of America's
&gt; corporate headquarters in Auburn Hills, a northwestern suburb of Detroit.
&gt; There are several changes to make note of.  Mark your calendars for a fun
&gt; road trip!

First off, I'm guessing that Chris has never attended the event.  I stand
by what I said above.  I've been to the last seven or eight of them, and
despite what you might imagine from the recent &quot;VWoA&quot; message traffic about
copyright protection, the folks at VWoA headquarters have always graciously
provided their headquarters facilities, their staff, opened their Museum
Collection of rare, old &quot;AIR COOLED&quot; vintage VW's for viewing, provided
special VW displays and lots of goodies to be given out to attendees, and
have always been very supportive to the MVVC Chapter of the VVWCA and are
excellent hosts!  I'm not kidding or exaggerating!  You should come see for
yourself.  

Without opening up this topic again, they do have an obvious right to
protect their trademark if they choose to do so.  Wishing they wouldn't
won't change that.  But VWoA does make an big effort to support the MVVC's
Vintage Festival (basically an &quot;air cooled&quot; event), and have never balked
because the MVVC choose to limit 1979 and earlier VW's to the Vintage
Festival's display area.  In return, the MVVC choose to make an exception
to their &quot;'79 and earlier&quot; rule by having an area for new Beetles to
display.

If by chance anyone is suggesting that they wouldn't, or we shouldn't
attend because of VWoA's recent enforcement of their copyright's, well, I
guess I'd have to disagree with them and tell them that we'll all miss
them. 

I am not currently a MVVC member although I have come to know and enjoy the
company of many of them, and I don't work for VWoA.  I'm just a satisfied,
frequent attendee of this fine event.  Sometimes I fly up, and other times
I drive ten hours one way in one of my VW's to spend a great weekend with a
whole lot of other VW enthusiasts.  It's as simple as that.  Do whatever
you want to do, but I know where I, and a lot of other VW fans will be on
that weekend.  Chris, and everyone, I hope to see you there.
