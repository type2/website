Subject: VW/Porsche parts xref

It's long been known that there was a lot of crossover in
VW and Porsche parts, especially in the air-cooled years.
Some were common knowledge, some aren't immediately obvious.
The earlier cars seem to have a lot of crossover, fading over
time as the VW and Porsche moved farther apart.

I'm trying to assemble a cross-reference table.  I've never
seen one done before, and did some googling and came up empty
handed.

I've started mine _at_ http://vintagebus_dot_com/porsche/xref

I've heard that some bay-window bus disc brake parts are the same
as early 911, and 72-79 bus engines are almost identical
to 914 engines.  Check out the page and send along any additions
you may have.

Thanks!

Thom
