&lt;&lt; Time to reseal one of the 67 big nut trannies today.  Should run pretty 
much 
 leak free now!  Anyways, does anyone have a clue as to what common problems 
 are associated with a tranny squeeking?  The squeek starts after the bus has 
 run about 10 or so miles and seems to be worst when turning and starting off 
 at a stop.  Could this happen to be related to the reduction bearings?  Im 
 going to have to pull the thing apart unless I can fiure it out with some 
 help and that would be a BAD thing considering its my only car ;)    Any 
help 
 is very much appreciated!
 
 If anyone in phoenix wants to stop by and hang out, come on over!  I even 
 have cows you can pet!  
 Im sure NQ would look great here on the farm!
