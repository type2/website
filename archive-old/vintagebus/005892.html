Subject: Re: [VB] Stretchy belt...?

Hi      I've got 2 1776 engines one stretches and rotates belts, I've gone
through 3 in 2500 miles, the other does not,same belts, adjusted the same. I
don't go over 5500 rpm in either engine, and usually way below that, 4th
gear cruising isn't the highest rpm for me  it's shifting up through the
gears... The engine that stretches belts revs up so much quicker, I think it
must be the speed it changes RPM (lightened fly wheel and in the Beetle).  I
was browsing through Air cooled nets web site and He has a belt to use to
combat this. I'm going to get one of those and see what happens... Lloyd in

&gt;As I said before, if you have a BUG tranny with a BUG fourth, the gearing
&gt;may very well be too short. The fourth gear in a bug tranny is fine with
&gt;straight axles, but it wasn't intended to be coupled to redux boxes. I've
&gt;had this combo on a couple of buses and it ain't good for highway speed.

&gt;&gt; As a 3.88 R&amp;P will DROP engine RPMs and a stock 4.125 R&amp;P tranny delivers
&gt;60 mph
&gt;&gt; _at_ 3620 RPMs with Small Nut RGBs, please explain to me HOW you can &quot;over
&gt;rev&quot; at
&gt;&gt; 60mph in 4th gear????????
