A few folks mentioned to check the lever to make sure it was in the release
position. I did this and the lever is full forward. Even at the full release
point, the cables are three inches from the equalizer. When I pull with vise
grips, there is no movement forward so I will need to pull the rear hubs to
investigate.  Another listee mentioned the cables costing about $100 for a
pair, I had no idea they were this expensive! I feel certain if the PO
installed the incorrect size, they would remove and get the right ones at
this price. So, this leads me to believe there is some other reason the
cables aren't hooked up. I'll try again tomorrow if time allows. Thanks for
all the advise.
