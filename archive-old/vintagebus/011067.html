&lt;&lt; So what I am wondering is if anyone knows where to get a fuel pump rebuild 
kit that would have the gasket I need, or has any suggestions on making a 
gasket, or any hints to a quick quality fix. &gt;&gt;
Hi Ben,
If you mean the fuel pump with the filter cover on the top we have had the 
same problem.  Found out that carefully cutting cereal box cardboard works 
well.  Will slightly seep for a couple of days, but seems to seal up with the 
varnish of the fuel itself.  Have also heard of using some type of petrol 
proof varnish to seal the cardboard before installing it.  The biggest 
problem we actually had was stripping out the top cover mounting bolt.  Too 
small, and to easy to strip out of the fuel pump body.  We just increased the 
bolt diameter, and drilled, and tapped the threaded hole in the fuel pump 
body slightly bigger.   Eric&amp;Barb
