Hi Kevin,
Disconnect the battery cable/s.  Then proceed to remove the headlight switch 
from under the dash and disconnect it from the wires.  Then take a drill and 
small bit to drill out the tube type rivets that pin the light switch body to 
it's rear cover.  Holding the drill at a slightly off angle helps the bit to 
cut better and not just spin the rivets.  Remove the rear cover and note what 
side of the inner shaft/switching block is against #57 terminal connection 
arm.  For pre-1961 light switches clean and solder the rivet connections 
inside, for post-1960 do the same and also solder each of the two pieces of 
brass on the outside/forward of the switch together.  Remove the 
shaft/switching block to wipe off all grease in there and polish badly 
scored/burnt surfaces.  Apply silicon grease (Dielectric grease) to the 
slider contacts and slide back in the shaft/switching block while getting the 
contact arm in it's place with a deft slight tilt of the shaft/switching 
block to get this arm inside it's area to contact the inside of the reostat.  
 Replace the rear cover onto the body of the switch and used small long 
screws with nuts as a replacement of the original tube rivets.  You might 
have to file off some of one side of the nuts to allow them to fit the switch 
cover properly.  
  We have doen this to our 1960 panel camper conversion (Nermal) and our 1963 
SC (Ellie) resulting in not only a cooler switch, but brighter headlights!  
Just a couple of days ago did same to a fellow's 1958 Westie (With only 
80,000 original miles on it.) which had partly sindged the large white with 
black stripe wire due to the high resistance in the switch!
