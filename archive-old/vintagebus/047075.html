Hi Hal,
Well it depends what you mean by best.  Best for getting down the road with
enough HP and longevity or to push it into orbit.  Since it sounds like you
are starting in VWs you probably should start with a single port 1600 and
learn on that first.  Then later maybe a type 4, 2 liter engine converted into
upright.  Or if that does not do it for you, build a V-2 rocket engine and go
for broke or orbit which ever comes first!  Eric &amp; Barb
