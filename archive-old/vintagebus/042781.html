&gt; What am I doing wrong???  Could my carb (30/31 Solex) be bad, it looks pretty

Its probably the jetting.

I have a friend that lives in albuquerque, he recommends a 112 main jet
for altitude.... I use a 115 at sea level on my single port with my bocar
30/31.

If its a bocar 30/31 they come with a 120 main jet... i would try stepping
down whatever is in there 5 at a time till it runs right, but dont go too
lean or you wont be able to go to sea level!

Another altitude trick is to advance 1 degree extra for every 1000 feet
above 3000... so if you have a 009 timed at say, 10 idle for max advance
of 30, if you live at 7,000 retime to 14_at_idle 34 max...

But as always i can be wrong, verify to your own satisfaction wether or
not what i say is good or bad info.

take care,

Steve
