Thom-  Assuming you have your landlords permission, you shouldn't have too
much trouble building a simple awning structure- essentially a 2x4 roof
supported by four 4x4 legs with braces.  Such a structure woul probably be
fine to be free-standing, but could be attached to the house wioth just a
couple of long lag screws.  You would then have to patch the screw holes if
and when you ever moved.  The whole thing could be fastened together with
lag screws into manageable portions, so that it could be transported to a
different location.  Fiberglass or galvanized roofing panels would
definitely be the way to go for roof covering.  For the landlord- just
point out that it will be free-standing and that it will be removed without
damging the house.  There are code requirements for covered patios here in
Albuquerque, but most inspectors are far too busy to notice something this
small going up.  Just make sure it looks good- not rickety, and you won't
have nay complaints...

&gt;I'm considering building a &quot;covered storage area&quot; for lack of a
&gt;better term, both to cover the parts that must live outdoors, and to
&gt;cover a potential project bus.
&gt;
&gt;I have a concrete pad on the side of the house, next to the garage.
&gt;It's 13.5' wide.  What I want to do is make a wood-framed top cover
&gt;for it, using that corrugated fiberglass roofing stuff.  It would
&gt;be ~20' long, 10' high, 13.5' wide.    I wasn't planning on
&gt;covering the sides.
&gt;
&gt;I rent, which is also an issue.  I'm willing to eat the cost of
&gt;materials and labor if it means my bus would have a dry home.
&gt;
&gt;My questions:
&gt;
&gt;* Do I need a permit (I'm in Citrus Heights, CA, but I assume
&gt;these rules are probably similar elsewhere)
&gt;* What's the best way to attach it to the sideof the house?
&gt;* Anyone done this before, and can offer suggestions?
&gt;
&gt;Thanks!
