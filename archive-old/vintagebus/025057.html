I had originally just sent this to the fellow w/ the question but I
think a number of you may have the similar request for info:

Depending on the size and weight, UPS might not be able to ship your
parts, plus I don't think they have the best prices. I was looking to
ship 50lbs but some peices were over 5ft in length.

I suggest checking out:

as well as:

Consolidated gave me the best prices and they have hubs in almost every
large city. For other companies you may be able to cut your prices if
you ship from hub to hub. You would have to take your package(s) to
their site and pick up from their site - *sometimes* this results in a
reduced rate.

Remember to let them know what you are shipping. Used car
parts get a better rate than new car parts (insurance). Rates are
determined by &quot;class&quot; each type of item shipped has a different class.
I had first just said that I was shipping car parts and got quotes for
up to $180. Then one person really helped me out by explaining what the
class description was and by letting them know I was shipping USED car
parts my rate was reduced to $120 - which Consolidated beat.

There you go, hope its helpful.

If anyone has better rates I'd love to know!
Melissa
