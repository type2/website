Subject: RE: Re-installing vent wing glass..

Hi! 
  I finally got it in myself... Sounds something similar to the workmate
bench?  I used about a 1.75 foot 2x4 on both opposing sides of the
glass.(the angles of the window are weird, so you have to drill a partially
diagonal hole in one of them to accommodate the frame post)  Then I drilled
2 more holes at the end of each 2x4 and ran a long thick bolt thru both
sides and attached them with a nut and however many washers you need
depending on the threads.(you can use 2 separate eyed bolts and connect them
in the middle with a carabiner or something if you cant find a long bolt.)
You can use about 10 to 15 washers or another piece of wood to take up any
slack created between the frame.  Line the wood with a piece of good
rubber.... and turn the bolt!!!  It went on like slicing butter. I had the
thick Wolfsburg west rubber.   I used dish soap to help lube.  The only
trick is to perfectly balance the 2x4's so that they apply pressure evenly.
I also used a pair of woodworking slider clamps to help brace the pressure
tool where needed.  Those were the most expensive at about $15 each.  
  Every inch or so, switch the 2x4's to the other side(top to bottom now)
and tighten there too, to make sure everything is keeping close and not
bending the frame. DON'T BEND THE FRAME.
  Another tip:  Be careful to only put the lube where you need it.  If it
gets onto the pressure surfaces, the stuff will be surfing all over when you
tighten it, and this ads a whole new dimension to the drill, and the clamps
really have to be used smartly. =)
    Thanks to all for your help!!!  I used a combo of all your good ideas...
I have pics of the tool if anyone is getting desperate...
 Aloha,  J.D

&gt; I wanted to use the original rubber to install my vent wing glass but
&gt; am noticing that you have to use a special VW press to get it in there?
&gt; Does anyone have any good experience with using any other techniques?

I think some people have successfully used a Black and Decker &quot;Workmate&quot;
workbench to do this.  The top of a Workmate has a clamping action
similar to the VW special tool.  Searching the archives (at
http://www.type2_dot_com/archive/vintagebus ) with &quot;workmate glass&quot; reveals
some likely hits:

In one of the above, Ronnie at Old Volks said he was going to take some
pictures of installing the glass and rubber with a Workmate.  Ronnie,
if you're listening, do you have a link to the photos?
