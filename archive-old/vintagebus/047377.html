Where is the port in Alberta-   thought that was in the middle of the 
country.   Anyway,
O found this great book at Barnes and Noble yesterday- Called

 Volkwagens of the World, by Glen Simon.

  It is all about VWs produced elsewhere than in  Germany for Germany.  Has 
sections on many differnt types from war time through water cooled.  Has pics 
of brasilia buses, Hong Kong buses, aussie buses with wierd high vents (some 
one row of wide vents, one with two narrow rows of vents, said that bus was 
Aussie army spec?), how UK spec trucks often had the back side windows metal 
to reduce the tax (?!?)  also on specs for diff countrys, including Canada 
and the US.  1999 Mexican bugs with ABS, Algerian and south african VWs.   
The writer evidently has has VW for years, as several of the cars pictured 
were his (at one time) and I didn't really look at the watercooled section 
even.  Has a really cool pic of a 46 bug made into a van, with a very cool 
roof rack.    And  a big hurky truck thing like a Unimog, that is powered 
with a flat 4 VW ac motor.    Evidently the autthor would travel extensively 
in his VW van or whatever, pics of a camper being loaded or unloaded from a 
big boat, trips across Europe and asia etc.     No wonder he noticed the 
different varieties of VWs.

.........................................

 I believe we (Canada) had all US spec. Busses. We didn't adopt the Metric

system until the 70's.

  Turns out that &quot;KA&quot; means Alberta Canada....

Michael



&gt; Which brings about a good question - Did Canada get Euro spec Buses,

&gt; US-style Buses, or somewhere in between?

&gt;

&gt; Also, &quot;KA&quot; is the delivery port - &quot;K&quot;=Canada but where is &quot;A&quot;?  I don't

have

&gt; that in my listing.
