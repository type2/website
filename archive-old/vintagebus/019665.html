Howdy!

I just did a search on your site, Thom, for the 195 number, and came up with a few in every
category (deluxe, panel, etc...34 total listed). They range from Oct. of 60 - Jan. 66, with the
majority being 61-63, as YOU have previously noted.(I searched the archives... quite an exhausting
feat! Matter of fact, I gave up!!)  Seeing as how this covers a lot of motors, might we,
therefore, assume that the 195 is not an engine related component?  We could also assume, because
of the number placement that it is probably for something superficial, such as a lighting option,
or a mirror, as it's neighboring numbers are? 

All that being said, can we put a call out for all who have this code and who use this list, to
post what they think it could be??  Perhaps this way, as others have tried on various occasions,
with various codes, we might be able to narrow down what it could be.

For example... could it possibly be the &quot;sliding seat&quot; as previously mentioned?  Mine does have a
bench, non-walkthrough, that has a multi-positional seat.  It has three positions, for both back
and bottom halves.  Don't laugh, just tell me I'm wrong, if you think so!  OK... you can at least
smirk.  My bus has been so rigged, it's a little hard to look for other conceptual &quot;factory&quot; mods.

Are you catching on to my rambling, yet?  Have there been any more findings, or does anybody know
any more than I do?  If so, please reply.

Thanks,
Travis Adams
