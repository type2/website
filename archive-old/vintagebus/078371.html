Subject: Re: Adhesives from May 1959

&gt;I was about to do this task a month or so ago but I stopped short in
&gt;realizing that I should find out what type of adhesive would be
&gt;correct. [for double-cab gas tank divider plate felt]

In the reprint Bentleys, there is a list of &quot;Adhesives and sealing
compounds&quot;.  To me, &quot;Genuine VW Adhesive D 12&quot; is the best candidate.
Throughout the &quot;Body&quot; section, D 12 is called out for sticking seals
to panels and doors.

http://wetwesties1.tripod_dot_com/Journeys2/z4-2.html specifically mentions
using D 12 on felt.  The beginning of a RAMVA thread on D 12 alternatives
is at
http://groups.google_dot_com/groups?selm=371C04D4.53D6%40sprintmail_dot_com .

Next question... what the hell is D 12?  It thins with benzene, if
that's any help.  Maybe call the VW dealer and ask for some?

&gt;I know you would all shun me if I used the wrong stuff :-O

We already know you're not using NOS Hanover air in the tires, so we
can probably forgive a little inaccuracy with the gas tank felts... :)
