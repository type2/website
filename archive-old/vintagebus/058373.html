Jason,
I did my 67 SC with the adapter and a new 24mm master cylinder and it worked
perfectly. Since my 67 is factory dual circuit, the brake lines matched to
the holes just like it was an original installation. The only change I had
to make was extending the second brake light switch wiring so that it would
reach back to the slanted down hole. I have oictures of the installaion out
on vintage site under misc.

Hi Jason

For your master cylinder, contact Wolfgang Int'l.  They sell an adapter($40)
which allows you to use a 73-79 MC ($40) I just put one on  my 67 std bus a
couple of weeks ago.  works great, and in the future I can just use the $40
MC if I ever need to replace.  You will need to use your old reservoir or
purchase a new one, but they just snap in place.

Bob

&gt; Hello there list, im new here, but been on vintagvw for years but just
&gt; recently acquired a reason to wander around these here parts.
&gt; http://members.aol_dot_com/jcwfla/bus.jpg  is that reason!
&gt; Ok I bought the bus as a quasi project, its runs and drives (sorta) but
sat
&gt; for a long time and needs lots of things.
&gt; Thing #1 - it needs a master cylinder. Ive changed these on bugs before
and
&gt; thought nothing of it, until seeing that its 1 yr only and $195 at
bus-boys!
&gt; Im sure the seller had a laugh.. i didnt imagine this was the case. Anyone
&gt; rebuild these? Its literally pouring fluid out of the shaft...
&gt; thing #2 - Needs shift bushings, sloppy (doesnt pop out of any gears tho),
&gt; one in the front, what about the coupler in the rear, where is it and how
&gt; hard to get to? (whole job..)?
&gt; thing #3 - has the safari windows and a stock antenna. How do i bend the
&gt; antenna to accomodate the safaris? should I take it to a machine/metal
shop?
&gt; Just put it in a vise and overcompensate the bend to get it in the
ballpark?
&gt; (it bends back).. any ideas?
&gt;
&gt; I think thats the short list for now.. has a few valdez sized oil leaks
too
&gt; but those i can resolve with a quick once over on the motor i
&gt; believe..thanks for any help, pmails fine if you can help me..
