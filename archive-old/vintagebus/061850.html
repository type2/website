Subject: Cheap Westy Canvas

Someone posted a link to A.A. Best Co. on one of the lists regarding 
their canvas ($241 for single window Vanagon canvas). Good enough price 
that all the lists ought to know about them. It's right in there with 
BusDepot's prices. ($239.95) An additional feature is the 5 year warranty.

They're sending samples and I expect that The Orphan ('82 
Klankenstinkenkampenwagen) will sample their wares.

IMHO their website is worth a look and they seem to be right on top of 
their e-mail.  I sent a question and had an answer within 20 minutes.

Jim
