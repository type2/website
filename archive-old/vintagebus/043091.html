You're getting the clutch diameters (180 and 200mm) confused with flywheel
diameters for the 6V and 12V applications.
There have never been any 6V flywheels that are the same diameter as 12V.
Some aftermarket set ups perhaps...but not from VW.

&gt; Wait. Didn't all 6v '66s come with a 6v 200mm flywheel, thus
&gt; necessitating the larger &quot;12v size&quot; bellhousing even in the 6v version,
&gt; thus allowing them to use the same trans case for the 6v standard and 12
&gt; option?
