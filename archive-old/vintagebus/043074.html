Spent 7 days getting the '66 Westy up and running.  Everything went well
too!  Drums turned, new wheel cylinders front and rear, new brake shoes,
motor completed and put together, new clutch disc. pressure plate, exhaust
system, corrected wiring problems, rebuilt redux boxes, wheel bearings,
pop top seal and on and on...time to test drive it.  
Started almost immediately...warmed it up and it sounded good.  Put the
clutch in, put it into first, let the clutch out and the racket the tranny
made was shuddering.  Literally.  But the Bus didn't move an inch.
I thought perhaps I missed a stripped out brake drum and the axle was
spinng inside of it out back...no such luck.
So I'm pretty sure that the R&amp;P are big time shot.  Talk about depressed.
Luckily, that evening I spent some time in a woodshop with another VW nut
making up some oak slats for his Westy roof rack and talking about my
problem with him turned my attitude around.  Thanks Scott Matson!
He's down at BBB right now with John Yost...lucky devil!
I've got another complete rear end...will get back to it right away and
swap em out.  What a bitch tho......7 days, and I mean no stone unturned
in mechanical preparations to have to find out the tranny is tits up.
Hope everyone elses week has been better than mine!
later
