&gt;Somehow I think the culture was different then.  Were there any
&gt;enthusiasts around in 50 when the first bus came out?  In 55, when
&gt;the &quot;new&quot; bus came out, what was the reaction?  &quot;Ug - look at tha
&gt;dam eyebrow thing!  And that tiny engine lid!&quot; (Jerry? Any insight?)
&gt;Same for '68, when the bay window hit the scene.  Or 80, when the
&gt;vanagon was thrust upon the country.  I don't remember any hullabaloo
&gt;about the Eurovan.
&gt;


I dont recall a big fuss from the barndoor to the next model. But I do know 
people who were old enough to really dislike the 68 model, except for the 
bigger front (more room, better view). They felt it just didnt drive the 
same, like a boat, like many people complain today.

As for the eurovan, and the vanagon, many people myself included just went 
YUK. Its a van not a bus. Whats the point?
