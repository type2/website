Subject: Re: [VB] Re: Cooked alternator?

&gt; Burning wire insulation has a kind of sickly-sweet, plastic-y smell.
&gt; If you have a short piece of scrap wire, and a Zippo, try it - but
&gt; outside, as it'll stink up the house

This smell was not the burning insulation smell.  I have experienced that
smell before at 65mph on I-5 in my VW rabbit.  Not good.  This was more of a
putrid, cow manure on fire smell.

&gt; &gt;There is also a powdery substance that reminds me of brake dust around
&gt; &gt;the alt. pulley.
&gt;
&gt; Was it black?  Might be dust from a brush in the alternator.  (Yes,
&gt; alternators have brushes too, but they don't wear nearly as fast as the
&gt; ones in generators.)

The dust was kinda a brown color.
