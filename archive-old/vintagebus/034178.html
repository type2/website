Subject: RE:RE [VB] high hinge covers!

My 1960 DD has the hinge covers on the forward doors only, even though it
has holes in the rear hinges. At the last Pomona I met with one of my
customers who has been looking for over a year for the hinge covers, well at
Pomona there was a fellow with a few sets of NOS covers with the SEALs, we
went through all covers trying to find rear ones and when we fitted all he
had to my bus there were no rears, then he asked what we were trying to do
and when we told him he. informed us that there never were rear door hindge
covers and the holes were just there, that didn't make any sense butI kind
of believe him being he has been into buses and has more NOS parts then I'll
ever dream of haveing and will probally be dead by the time I reach the
years he has in buses,but this again is only my opinion and I could be
wrong, so if anybody has a set of rear hinge covers I would love to buy 2
sets for my DD.

there is a difference in size and shape of the rear (if they exist)due to
the different profile of the body by the rear door.

&lt;&lt; Hey all,
     Can someone please tell me if high hinge cargo doors all came with
hinge
 covers?
 Or did only the front door come with covers ? or if this was an option ?
  &gt;&gt;

not all high hinge buses came with hinge wedges/covers, but those that came 
with wedges had wedges by all the hinges.  the later high hinge door buses 
had them, I think just late 60 through early 61.   if one of you doors had 
been replaced with a earlier high hinge door, then the early door hinge 
wouldn't have the hole for the wedge to be scewed to.
