Hi Garret,
Tach your idle to see what it is now!  You should check or have checked by a 
shop your carb jetting for your size engine, air cleaner, engine compartment, 
and even type of muffler!  Then tune your engine and then the carb so you 
idle about 900 RPM and see if it makes a differance in your idle oil 
pressure.   Eric&amp;Barb
