Subject: Fw: [VB] fuel flow problems

From Clara:
&gt; &gt; Hm, seems like there is still crud in the tank.  What helped for me is
&gt; find a
&gt; &gt; magnet (piece of speaker magnet is great) sew it in a litle bag- maybe
&gt; made

 I did that about 2 months ago.  There've only been tiny amounts of rust
 particles on the magnet and it didn't help at all.  I actually pulled it
out
 thinking maybe it was blocking the fuel from getting out of the tank
 somehow.

From Gary:
&gt;  There should be a screen, usually
&gt;called a sock filter, inside the gas tank where the fuel line exits the
&gt;tank that prevents big pieces of crud from plugging the fuel line.

Hmm... from what I remember when I pulled the tank, this screen was
conspicuously absent.  Actually, I could stick my finger right into the gas
tank through the gas fitting hole.  Maybe I'll try draining the tank and
taking that fitting off to poke around for crud.  Exploratory surgery, so to
speak.  Hopefully I'll find just one big piece of crud....
