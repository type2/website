Subject: Re: [VB] Yet Another safari question
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

Was kinda following this thread...have installed
factory original safaris in my old `61 westy....fit
like a glove...no pounding ect....the only catch was
the safaris where from a later bus and had the later
dash tabs...just took a dremel tool and ground a small
clearance curve in the dash tabs, just like the
earlier styles had...voila!  they cleared perfect!  No
'dash beating' ect...I feel sorry for the folks that
had beat the dash on their buses if it was not really
neccasary...YIKES! ;-)

&gt; So you are saying that its neccecary (or probably
&gt; needed??) to dent up the
&gt; dash and the windowframe to get safaris to fit on a
&gt; pre 63 bus?
&gt; 
&gt; I was operating under the impression that if you
&gt; take safaris out, you
&gt; just fill a few holes and all is back to normal, is
&gt; this way off?
&gt; 
&gt; Dunno if i'd put em in if i knew it would require
&gt; bashing my poor bus's
&gt; nice straight sheetmetal...
