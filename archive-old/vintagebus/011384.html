Subject: My 900 mile trip in the '69 westy/Bugpack SUCKS!!
To: type2_at_type2_dot_com, vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

Hey All,

The wife and I just returned from our first 900 miler (Portland to
Boise and back) in the Westy. The last four hours pushing a brutal
headwind that prevented us going over 55 mph :-(

It was a great drive and I learned a bit more about what to take more
of (exhaust gaskets) and less of on road trips.

We got off to late starts on both legs of the journey, so we spent 2
nights sleeping in the bus; very comfy!!

My only complaint would be with the DAMNED BUGPACK EXHAUST I installed
the day before we left. We didn't get an hour out of town before it
developed a serious leak between the heat riser and exhaust and
manifold.

I tried tightening it. SNAP!!! Broken bolt. No spare. Drove 2 miles
back up the highway to Wallmart (the only place open) in search of an
emergency spare.

Wallmart had no metrics, of course, but I did find some 1/4-20's that
worked. Sat in the parking lot and removed all that fun tin (AGAIN)
and installed a new bolt. Fired it up, still leaking!!! Closer
inspection reveals the cheap-ass gasket blew to pieces during the 2
mile drive after breaking the cheap-ass bolt!!!

Back into Wallmart I go in search of emergency gasket material to
accompany the emrgency bolt. The best I could find was some aluminum
tape. Sold.

After fashioning and installing a reasonable gasket of several layers
of said tape, I fired her up. Minor leak, but different location!!!
This one's coming from the heater box/manifold connection on the
drivers side!!! 

I VERY CAREFULLY (remembering the cheap-ass bolts) tightened it down
to a tollerable leak.

Got to Boise and took her to a friends VW shop and tore into it. By
this time, it was leaking EVERYWHERE!!!

In the process, I had to: replace ALL of the cheap paper gaskets that
came from Bugpack, replace ALL of the bolts, insert my case when I
overtightened a stud, cut off and replace a heater box flange, and
replace the clamps. 

And IT STILL LEAKS!!!!

Close inspection of the Bugpack revealed that NONE of the mating
surfaces where true!!! The connections for the heater boxes were out
of round and the head flanges were uneven!! I have since found that
this is common in Bugpack exhausts!!!

Hey, at least my homebrewed gasket worked!!!

DON'T BUY BUGPACK!!!!!

Jaime
