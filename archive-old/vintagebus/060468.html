Subject: Funny Ads

    I admit being addicted to Everett Barnes' great website &quot;thesamba_dot_com&quot;
and although I've never bought any of the cars advertised, I'm sure someday
I will. Once in awhile, the grammer and the errors make me laugh, for
instance &quot; 65' Westfalia&quot; (I picture a camper sixty-five feet long), and I
wish people would remember that the abbreviation for &quot;etcetera&quot; is &quot;etc.&quot;
not &quot;ect.&quot;. But, it's the actual grammatical statements that send me
howling, for example &quot;all original, completely restored&quot; appears quite
frequently.
Today's favorite is a Karmann Ghia which according to the advertiser &quot;This
car only needs an engine and will run perfectly.&quot;

Am I the only one that notices these things?
John Flowers :-)
