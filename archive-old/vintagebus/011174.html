&gt;  Hey Y'all,
&gt;  I am picking up my &quot;new&quot; 64 Camper tomorrow.  It is not currently running, 
&gt; so I expect to post a bunch of questions here in the coming weeks.  But for 
&gt; now I have these questions:  The bus is on the original 6 volt system, I 
know 
&gt; you can buy kits to convert to 12 volt.  What are the advantages of having 
a 
&gt; 12 volt system over a 6 volt system? Are parts for the 6 volt harder to 
find? 
&gt;  What are other pros &amp; cons of each??
&gt;  
advantages of 6V-   don't have toe buy all the 12V parts and swap them over

people often give you 6V stuff

wierds people out.  (amusemnet value)

advantages of 12V-
    dont need an adaptor to run a modern music machine
    parts somewhat easier to find new( but you can get all the 6V stuff- you 
may have to drive or call a couple stores)  I had to go to Schuck's to get 
6Vlight bulbs when one burned out in the 59 SC I used to have, Al's Auto did 
not have them

if it isn't broken, don't fix it.
