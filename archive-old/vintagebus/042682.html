&gt; &gt;After finance charges and insurance and everything on that new beetle,

&gt; Is there really any point to trying to convince someone to drive their Bus
&gt; year round?  Part of having a Bus is not having society's values crammed
&gt; down your throat.  Unless I'm mistaken, owing a Bus is not even a pre-requisite
&gt; to joining a VW club.

I'm not trying to convince anyone to do anything, i am sharing my
philosophy. I personally feel that buying a new car is fiscally
irrespnsible and throwing away that much money to &quot;save&quot; an easily
reparable vehicle is not something i would do, unless i just liked having
a new car with creature comforts, which is fine. If my bus gets totalled,
then i may change my tune, but i like driving it too much to not do it.  I
will have to restrain myself in the winter when they salt :(

&gt; I would agree it's foolish to have a new vehicle, new Beetle or otherwise,
&gt; better to have a POS 70s-80s car.  I do.  And someone just rear-ended it.
&gt;  Glad it wasn't my Bus.  Guess where the repair money is going...

That dovetails with my words to live by &quot;if you cant pay cash you cant
afford it.&quot; the only exception to that i would make is a house, but only
if i could find no other means of procuring more economical habitations.

if i decided to have a watercooled car it'd be a late 80's early 90's
jetta or golf or ? I guess i just feel that miles in my bus are never
&quot;wasted.&quot;  Driving my bus everywhere makes me feel great, i feel it is a
personal accomplishment that i am quite proud of.  Oters may have
different opinions, but mine is that getting out of the emissions/new
car/payments/ loop is worth the extra effort, today.  Tomorrow i may go
buy me a new shaguar, but probably not.

Having only one style of engine to fit all my vehicles means i only have
to learn one system, and only keep one kind of spares.  Good idea in my
book :)

So, in summary, engoy your bus however you like, its your bus, your life
and you should have fun with it. I'm just sharing the way i enjoy my
busses. I'm not perfect, my way isnt right or wrong, but its mine
today.  Tomorrow i may be different with different opinions on busses, but
thats fine too.

As a wise man once told me, the only constant in life is change.

Happy bussing,

Steve
