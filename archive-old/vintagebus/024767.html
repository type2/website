Got that new 23 window model yesterday in the mail. The body mold has
great detail down to the 'outie' engine louvers to the snaps on the
sunroof cover and it's based on a '63. Hasegawa has even molded the
cargo doors and rear hatch to be opened once you cut a few tabs that
hold them shut. The bumpers have guards and tubes with deluxe trim and
the correct slash tips. The interior is ok, they designed it to be a
nine passenger and from looking at the decals they want you to paint it
beige grey/sealing wax red.  We'll see about that.  :)

	They dropped the ball in the wheel department though; apparently to
save some yen they threw in slotted wheels ala 66-67 bug style. Even the
great illustration on the box has early beetle rims (no slots) in place.
Picky, picky, I shouldn't complain, at least somebody finally made a 23
window. 

	As Krusty the Clown would say, &quot; I heartily endorse this product and/or
event.&quot;

Time to dig out the airbrush,
Everett Rein
