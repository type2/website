My son has a friend with a 1966, plus or minus, pop-top camper bus he wants 
to get rid of... literally.  This bus is free simply because it is to much 
for him to do right now.  The body is remarkably straight except for the 
nose which, in my opinion, &quot;ain't bad&quot;.  Has most windows with latches... 
its a Combi conversion, all the doors with a badge affixed to the side of 
the pop-top from a place in Indiana.... yada yada yahdah...  Obviously it 
needs recovery with a number of parts.  The transaxle is in the car but one 
of the RGBs is dead and will not mount to the arm... so transport means a 
trailer or carriage for the rear end.  Has a signed over pink slip but 
that's it.  I'd give you more but it was dark ... I 'll have more later.

I would grab this myself but I don't have the space for it... my young lady 
tells me.  She is very indulgent of me but there are always limits, sigh. 
:-).  I will probably grab the type II case since my son has ours.

It is located in Benicia, California and they want it moved out soon. I want 
the bus saved and I personally feel it is well worth it!!  I don't require 
anything but I will say that this is a good kid and if someone sees there 
way to take it, I would ask you give him a token &quot;gift&quot;... not much, $100?, 
if you could see your way to it.  Not required, just a suggestion.  
Personally I'd love a referral to a straight rear bumper for my deluxe :-).

Anyone interested?  I will be going over to take a few pics I can send or 
perhaps find a place to post so pmail me if you are truly interested but I 
will probably be unable to respond until monday when I get back to my T1... 
I hate modems with the volume on the list.  Oh yeah...
