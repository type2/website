Subject: Re: [VB] Transmission - Help me please

no you dont need to swap redux boxes they bolt up to 
your existing spring plates. BUT if your bus has the 
original tranny i BELIEVE its made for a non syncro 
tranny so is your bus dose not have the modification
done to it you either need to purchase the weld on 
adapter or the bolt on adapter. WCM sells the weld on 
adapter but if you dont have a welder it could be more 
expensive. Wolfganng Int. sells a bolt on adapter for 
30 bucks you just have to grind down the middle hump on 
your nose cone a bit to make rom for the adapter and is 
bolts right in . hope this info helps.

&gt; Subject: [VB] Transmission - Help me please
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; I just did a 1500 mile trip loaded with furniture etc.. - and a dog and 2
&gt; cats - I am nuts! Anyway, now my transmission is popping out of 4th a lot
&gt; and it is howling like a banshee.  I found VW dealer who shut down about a
&gt; year or so ago and he has a transmission complete with reduction boxes,
&gt; starter etc.  He says it is good and I believe him so I bought it and just
&gt; have to go and pick it up.  I also got an NOS muffler, and he has an early
&gt; blade bumper for a beetle. But I ramble.
&gt; 
&gt; Anyway, he says this transmission is 67 or so and my bus is a 60 with the
&gt; original transmission - what do I have to be concerned about with swapping
&gt; them.  I guess I would have to use my redux boxes hey?  I have 15&quot; rims but
&gt; the 67 would take 14&quot; rims - right?  I would like to just slap the new one
&gt; in redux boxes and all but ... not at the expense of getting new rims and
&gt; tires.  Is it possible to just pull my motor and pull my transmission and
&gt; leave my reduction boxes on my bus? My guess is yes but .... I've only had
&gt; it out as a whole unit.  The ol' fella that I bought it from assures me that
&gt; the transmission, reduction box bearings, starter etc.. are all good - but
&gt; he won't guarantee the solenoid.  He would guarantee the rest though but he
&gt; wants more money if it comes with a guarantee.  I also found a guy who will
&gt; rebuild my old transmission.
&gt; 
&gt; Anyway - any advice as to what I should do about this transmission is
&gt; appreciated.
&gt; 
&gt; TIA list
&gt; jdd 60 std
