Subject: dizzy trouble update

Just a quick update WRT my hesitation trouble with my Solex 34 PICT-3/vacuum
distributor combination.

I scrounged a Bosch distributor for an Alfa Romeo engine which has an
adjustable vacuum canister, along with a spare NOS vacuum can for the same
application new in the box.  I made it fit my VW distributor with a touch of
grinding (the Alfa distributor was a different radius) and the results were
very successful.  The stumble on acceleration is gone, but I do still get a
bit of carburettor ice which sometimes causes a poor idle and stumble from
idle in cool weather after slow engine running.  I've been running the
combination for about two and a half months now and am satisfied with the
results.

I still have to install my degreed pulley to properly check the timing but the
engine was pulled last weekend for a major body and paint restoration so I can
do it now...along with a bit of engine detail work and the installation of a
stock exhaust system along with a carburettor heat riser.

Cheers,

Drew
