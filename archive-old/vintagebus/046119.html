Hi, 

I recommend looking in the archives for info on this subject as it is one 
that comesup every so often with regularity,  (just likes tires, flat spots, 
etc)

First I would reommend doing the tach the bus  at 2K, 2500K and 3K in each 
gear and make a table.  Or you can do the jack one wheel off the ground and 
turn the engine w/bus in gear and count turns and Stephen has the calculation 
on his website o Dave Easterwood does to try and figure out what gearing you 
have now.    

Also, what year bus do you have?

You wrote in this post you are running 205 14s- you could try taller tires 
instead of regearing.  It can help your road speed while it will not affect 
the speed by speedo if you have teh same size on all 4 wheels

Are you currently using small (36mm) or large (46mm) nut RGBoxes.  The smalle 
nut have 1.39 reductions while the bigs have 1.26 reductions.   This will 
make a big diff.

I will shortly be putting a 4.37 r&amp;p trans with .82 4th and 46mm nut RGbBs 
and 205 75 R15 tires in my 61.  With this combination before it cruised alll 
day happiest at 58 by the speedo, which was 3K rpm and 62mph road speed.  
When the RGBox noises became irritating and the brass film in the gear oil  
and whines tooo loud, I took the trans out and remove dthe ring gear and was 
very surprised to count 35teeth/8splines on pinion =4.37.

  It also had better gear intervals than in my 3.88 r&amp;p trans, and pulled 
better with a 1600.   

re lowering, I would find it impractical to do a tuneup, or drive into and 
out of driveways, and I like camping off smooth roads when I am on trips, so 
to me it would be impractical

Sounds like most people here are against running a swingaxle kit. I do
like the look of the stock height bus. I am concerned about being able
to find a good priced, reliable freeway flyer tranny. A freind of mine
