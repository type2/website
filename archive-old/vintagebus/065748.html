Subject: DP -&gt; SP conversion so far

Halfway done lessons learned for those inclined to try this.
First, thanks to all you listees who post, answer questions, and give 
encouragement to all!

Desired result:
SP doghouse, 7:1 compression, cool runner, reliability more desirable than 
going fast.  I've had pretty good luck with SP  engines, better than DP in 
buses for some reason (no, not calibrated guages and dyno tests so don't ask).

Background:
I purchased 2 longblocks and a set of SP heads as a package deal.  1 engine 
is currently running cool and strong in the Award Winning Burrito Express 
despite the fact that I left it DP, just CC'd heads, checked deck height 
and set up as 7:1 compression.

First piece of advice is even though it might be new in the VW box, take 
the time to check everything you can.  I found 6 small and 2 large case 
studs looser than spec on each engine, not the same on both.  6 of 16 head 
nuts were loose on the 1st engine.  Didn't bother checking the head nuts on 
the converter engine because the heads came off anyhow.  End play was good 
in the AWBE engine, the converter will need that set, it's .004&quot; large.

Cylinder studs:
Dp studs are 8mm, SP studs are 10mm.  To change a DP longblock to be ready 
for SP heads, you need 4 more longer upper studs.  You can't just go buy 
another set of DP studs because the upper left front (FIF) is actually a 
long like the lower studs.  It goes way into the case by #3 bearing 
journal.  I bought 4 new lower 8mm studs from my local aircooled guy and 
applied an 8x1.25mm die, cutting about 1 3/4&quot; more thread to one end and 
cutting off the excess.  Heads installed and torqued very sweetly after that.

Left upper engine bolt:
This engine is going into the Tinkertoy (67).  As you all well know, the 
left upper is a D-headed bolt with a nut applied from the engine room 
side.  With a doghouse cooler, this won't work unless I break my arm and my 
wrist in a couple places and shave almost all the meat off my 
fingers.  Just not enough room for my hand in there.  The solution I came 
up with is a D-shaped spacer with a hole that allows a bolt just like in a 
baywindow upright.  Seems to work ok, I tested it with a case yet to be 
donated to the conflagration at the next campout.

Doghouse tinware:
Because this is going in a splitty, I hunted up a bug doghouse front tin to 
try.  Haven't held it up against splitty tin to see if I need to do any 
fabrication, but it looks real close.  The obvious alternative is simply 
cut a splitty tin for the doghouse exhaust.  Rather not cut a tin that's 
getting hard to find but for the Tinkertoy I just might.

Bedtime folks ;-)
nighty night and happy new year
