Subject: Re: [VB] Side Glass

the glass is the same size.  the logo may be different.  It'll fit just fine, 
though.

&lt;&lt; Can someone tell me if the side window glass (push outs) in my 56 kombi is
 different then the side window glass in a 65?  I have a lead on some 65
 Sekuit windows, however I am not sure it they match my year.  Any help would
 be appreciated.
