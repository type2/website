&gt; HELP! I have 3 days to get the cargo doors off of my '67 and I am at a
loss
&gt; on how to do it. I removed the little plastic cap/screw and I can not
figure
&gt; out what is holding the pin inside the hinge. Someone told me there is a
&gt; screw but I do not anything but allot of crud. I tried digging the crud
out,
&gt; but I still do not see a screw down in there. Do I need a special tool?

I just went and got a pair of cargo doors from a wrecking yard bus. I got
the screws out of 3 hinges but not the top right one.  I didn't have a drill
to drill out the screw heads, which is the best way to do it.  Instead I
used a hacksaw and cut thru the 2 hinge ends on the doorpost end of the
hinge.  I figured I could drive out the roll pin when I got home..... so
far, WRONG!    I bought a Snap-on roll pin driver, PPR7 which is 7/32&quot;. No
amount of pounding has budged the roll pin!!
According to my parts book, from chassis # 705 620 uses a 211 841 509 B
sleeve, which is a rollpin.
I haven't figured out what 211 841 527 is. It is called wick - sleeve. Seems
to go inside the rollpin...I assume to store lubrication oil for the hinge?
Like the felt plug on top of the distributor shaft, under the rotor, that
everyone [!] puts a few drops of oil on during a tuneup.....
It looks like I will have to drill out the rollpin and see if VW still
supplies a new one......yeah, right!
