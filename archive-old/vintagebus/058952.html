Hello all,

Wanted to give you all first crack at the bus before I put it in the
newspaper.  Here's the details:

67 standard bus
Mostly complete but has rust in:
cargo floor, passenger floor, and behind front bumper (have replacement
panels for all bad spots)
Seats from a 66 Westfalia interior, but not other camper items
Both bumpers (recently redone)
New seals for Windshield &amp; popouts
Original Paint except for bottom 1.5 feet around bus
1600 DP that runs real strong
Electrical all works, including radio
2 yr. old reduction gear boxes
Brakes recently redone

Can be a good daily driver and candidate for a restoration.

Looking for $2500 obo
