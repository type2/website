Subject: Seat Humping

My '56 had the hump seat (I'm not saying it was correct for that year,
that's just
what I ended up with) and I re-covered it myself just fine, and didn't
loose the hump - because the hump is in the spring assembly itself!  I
don't see how you'd lose it...

&gt;in my 62 panel i reused the original horse hair pads (it had sat for 20
&gt;years), the reason for this was due to the hump in the backrest (62 only?)
&gt;and the inability of anyone i contacted to redo this hump. Boy do i regret
&gt;this now, i feel like i'm sitting on the springs, the hump has all but gone
&gt;away and every time i lift the seat out i have a mess, so! go with the new,
&gt;Wolfsburg West makes and sells these and i also sell their product.
