&gt; I drive my '67 EZ Camper every day unless I have it torn apart for repairs.
&gt; I love driving my bus even when the weather turns really bad and we get

&gt; Kinda reminds me of my daily Salt Lake City commute in January in the 63 DC.
Temperature 10-15 degrees F, snow on roads, heat minimal, gas pedal broken
and had to use bare big toe to keep pedal in place while driving, but only
for 10 miles each way.  And to think i grew up in Hawaii and didn't have to
wear any shoes till 7th grade!
