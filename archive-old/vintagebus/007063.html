That's a brutal picture. I just showed it to my son who drove our bus for
the first time ever yesterday.
He was impressed to say the least.
Glad you're still with us. That red stripe down the front is really nasty.

&gt; Hi All,
&gt;
&gt; I'm just getting back on the list ater quite a hiatus.  You see I was
&gt; involved in quite an accident in my split a little over a year ago.
&gt; Broadsided by a car going 40-50 mph.  But I'm still standin...I have
posted
&gt; a picture at http://www.dbsitebuilder_dot_net/66smash.asp .
&gt;
&gt; Anyhoo, Although postponed, I still have a trip up to Alaska, (from FLa.),
&gt; planned.  Right now I'm building a 63' Panel, with the reminents of the
&gt; camper I had in the 66'.  Any &amp; all inquires are welcome, as I am still
&gt; roughing out the itinerary/route.  The tenitive plan is to leave in the
&gt; spring  of next year, and hug the southern states, then move up the west
&gt; coast, twards the beginning of summer.
&gt;
&gt; Check out the pic, and let me know your thoughts on the trip.
&gt;
&gt; Thanks
&gt;
