Subject: Re: [VB] A story of Roadcow's help/ LONG

I wanted to give a plug to a couple of the Amarillo guys who helped out. I 
don't really personally know either one of these guys, just chatted a 
little through the internet. But it seems like they really came through and 
helped out. Neither one had anything to gain. Just helped out a fellow VW 
driver.

Jim O'Malley at email address: jim.omalley_at_kamr_dot_com .

He runs the website Volkswagens in Film and Video http://vwfilms_dot_net/ . He 
loaned his Super Beetle to the guys.


Jerry at email address: vwdragon_at_arn_dot_net

He's just a cool guy who decided to improve his VW Karma by helping out.


Email these guys and show support. I'm sure they'll appreciate it.
