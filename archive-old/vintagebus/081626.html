From James Treanor:

Ask them if they will sell the bus and give you a reciept for the bus as
parts, run the vin thru Titles Unlimited and title it that way.  I'm sure it
will get under the Calii radar that way as long as it's not stolen.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

Nooooo........ do not go thru Titles Unlimited or any other mail order title company.
All of them are being scutinized by Calif DMV.

From this article: http://streetrodderweb_dot_com/hotnews/0410sr_boyds/

Read this paragraph:

&quot;The California Department of Motor Vehicles is in the process of canceling registrations that involve
documents obtained from Titles Unlimited. (Titles Unlimited is believed to have provided false documents to
Californians that cost the state more than $1 million in tax revenues and license fees over the past two
years, and as much as $14 million since 1975, when the company began operating.) The Attorney General's Office
also has notified law enforcement officials in more than 20 counties regarding residents who titled their cars
through the company for possible prosecution.&quot;

I have a 67 bus I bought from a wrecking yard 4 years ago, I have not done the paperwork yet. I thought about
going thru an out of state title company so I would not have a salvage title. So I asked a high-up-on-ladder
DMV friend of mine about using Broadway etc and he said &quot;No no no, don't do it, we are investigating all of
them&quot;. He knew.......
