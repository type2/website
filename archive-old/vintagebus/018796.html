I looked at the can that I got at &quot;Big Lots&quot;, and it
is &quot;plastikote&quot; brand, &quot;Import Color&quot;    #5406 Datsun.
 It is a 6 ounce spray can for touch up, and the UPC
code on the lid was 7191505406.
I thought it was a close match, and I wish I had
bought more at 39 cents a can.  I haven't looked yet
at the FLAPS to see if it is still available, or the
same color might be available in another brand.
Of course, getting an exact match mixed would be
better, but I'm cheap!!

65 double cab, Pearl White of course
75 bus, orange or red or something, and white
