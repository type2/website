Also check the bracket that &quot;the thinga magigger&quot; (L-shaped bit ). I found 
mine had a slight bend in it and this was causing it to hang-up. Seems that 
after 38 years the bracket had started to fatigue and required welding 
extra material on to fix.

&gt;check the thinga magigger under the front floor mine hangs up all the time
&gt;if the pin going through it has any play in it at all it will go sideways
&gt;and hang up on itself i replaced the pin with a bolt with a washer on both
&gt;sides just snug enough to keep every thing in line
