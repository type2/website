Subject: Re: [VB] wheel studs

&gt;I'm running 5 spoke Empi wheels on my 63 double cab.  [...]  All I can 
&gt;find are the Bug Pack wheel studs, which are about as soft as butter.

I have seen wheel studs on the shelf at the FLAPS (Pep Boys, Auto Zone).
These are usually the kind with a knurled part that is meant to go in
a hub flange, though, and I think you want a regular stud with threads
on both ends.  You might check with a local go-fast shop; there is one
here in town that does nothing but fancy wheels and racing tires, and
they also stock adapters, wheel studs, lug nuts, etc.  Take in an old
stud or nut so you can get the same thread.  You might also try a
hardware store or industrial fastener supplier, but I don't know what
hardness grade you would need.
