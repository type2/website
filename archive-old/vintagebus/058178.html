&gt; How tight should that throwout bearing be when it's mounted?
&gt; 
Hi Rex,
Spring tight!  Take a new TO bearing arm and measure the distance from the 
clip notch in the front of the TO bearing arm to the most forward section of 
the curvature that holds the TO bearing.  Most likely the arm was worn due to 
being mounted off center in relation to the tranny input shaft and the TO 
bearing was forced side to side thousands of times per minute and this 
resulted in wearing out the arms!  BTDT!
