Subject: Re: Speedo Issue, Solution?

Hey all,

I had a chance to take my hubcap off during lunch today at work and roll 
the bus back and forth a couple feet.  I lined up one of the lugnuts and 
the top of the end of the clip; then I watched the clip-end and compared it 
to the lug to make sure it wasn't spinning.  Definitely didn't look like it 
was spinning!

Then I wondered if rolling it a couple feet would make it noticable at 
all.  So when I got home from work just now, I cruised into the parking lot 
somewhere between 3 and 5 mph, opened the door, and craned my head out (no 
idea I had to lean so far out) to see if it was turning.

Nope.  I could see the clip was still, the gob of grease on the clip was 
still, and the cable end was still.  Ladies and gents, I do believe I have 
a rounded out dust cap.

Comments?  Other thoughts?
-Taylor
