Hi George, The tubing from the left side of the muffler that connects to the
right side of the heat riser tube is positioned inside the muffler so to
cause positive pressure to flow into it. The left tube in the muffler on the
other hand has it's tip positioned just inside the outlet to the tailpipe
which causes it a negative pressure (Just like a pneumatic vacuum
functions!). Having the larger gasket on the right side of the heat riser
allows a positive pressure in the heat riser. The left gasket with it's
lesser diameter hole allows a certain flow of exhaust gases through the heat
riser to keep it hot, but once the exhaust passes through the lesser
diameter gasket the exhaust gas expands, cools and tends to deposit
carbon/fuel in the tube in the left side of the muffler. Since the muffler
is replace far more often then the intake manifold the deposits most likely
are not going to have time to cause problems. Eric&amp;Barb

This is new to me and my engine does not use a small hole heat riser gasket
on the left currently and I have never seen one....  What might the VW part
number be and where is a good source for the correct small hole gaskets?

Maybe Bus Depot or Old Volks/Ronnie(usually has some hard to find stuff)?  I
have to make a parts order hear soon so figure get them all at once....
Winter dictates I get the heat exchangers in (currently J-tubes) and hot air
intake for the oil bath working.  Also connect the thermostat again.  Work
work work :)
