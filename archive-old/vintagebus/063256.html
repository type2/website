It seems like all the other bearings and cylinders would have been damaged
as well.  If only one bearing shows damage I'd think it wasn't that.
I haven't built hundreds of engines though.
Maybe the oil passage had an obstruction.  End play wrong? Clutch adjusted
too tight?
A new balance engine sure shouldn't shake the truck.
