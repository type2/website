In response to that tent question earlier, I have a tent from our 71 westy
that we bought brand new in germany and used for several years and it does
have the flap for the sliding door inside it and grey floor. I still own the
tent and use it a couple times a year. I have never found the date on the
inside though , but it was brand new with our bus which we bought late in
71.I still have the original ties and bags and aluminum slide brackets for
the ropes which say germany on them. it looks just like the one in that
picture posted earlier.
