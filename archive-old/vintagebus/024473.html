Subject: Lack of seals and Heater Perf.

Hello All

I recently began driving my 72 westy, which I got from a
fellow list member (thanks Pat), everyday.  Well it's
beginning to get chilly, lows in the low 30's and morning
frost.  Well the poptop had no seal.  So I bought one from
Bus depot, put it on, But it was not long enough, about 5
feet short, probably an error, I have sent it back for a
replacement, as per their directions.

Well today I drove it to work without the seal, I had keep
the short seal on for several days,  and the bus got no
where near as warm inside at is did with the seal in place.
So all you folks out there concerned about poor heater
performance, I'm not referring to people in freezing
climates where the volume just isn't there, check all your
seals.  I have never compared with and without seals before
now, and those guys are right, it makes a BIG difference.

I now will spend this weekend sealing up the bus correctly
and insulating heater tubes and the like.

BTW
I have realized in the past several weeks how fun my bus
is.  I have been busless for 5 years now and I'll never got
back there again.

Brent
