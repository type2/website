Subject: OK...Try it again....

To Da'List   Hi bus people I was wondering if anyone
would care to share the story of how their bus got the
name it now has.I am a newbie here and thought it
might help to learn who is out there.Those without a
bus at the moment might send in the name they want for
their bus and why......My 67 is named.. Ol'No
Name...after a black lab that was my buddy many years
ago during our prime beach days......Ah...back when
the beach bunnies just could not get enough of
me.....&quot;Hey Mark!!! Wake up and get back to work!!!.....

=====
Mark and his under-repair...by me...poor thing..67 Deluxe walk thru 13 window Ol'No Name in San Luis Obispo,Calif...7 miles to the ocean! Sea-Ya (:}
