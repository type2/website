Subject: master cylinder upgrade

Hello list and especially E&amp;B,

    This last weekend I upgraded by brakes using the late loaf master
cylinder and the adapter kit sold by wolfgang.
    Everything seems to work fine,  I have noticed a slight vibration
when I apply the brakes, I am attributing this to out of round drums.
    My question is this, I followed the instructions from the library
but I don't see how I'm going to get my belly pan back on.  With the
line for the front brakes coming out of that funny port, there isn't
enough room for the belly pan.  I don't think I can make a smaller bend
in that line.  Can't I use the other port at the back of the MC?  Please
advise as I wish to continue using my belly pan, I spent too long
looking for it.
    BTW I have a 65 standard, with the correct belly pan (I think, what
is the difference in the 67 pan?
Thanks,
Jon
