&gt;Hello everyone, My new to me crew cab has some serious electrical problems.

Sometimes the weirdest problems have the simplest solutions.  If your
rear lights are doing anything odd, check their grounding first thing!

Another way to look at it is that it *is* all connected, but you can
work on subsytems of the entire electrical system.  For example,
battery-generator-starter is a system, ignition switch-choke heater-
coil-points is a system, headlight switch-dimmer switch-headlights-
front parking lights-rear running lights-dash lights is a system,  
turn signal flasher-turn signal switch-hazard switch-hazard relay-
brake switch-turn signals-brake lights is a system, etc.  If you
work on one system at a time it might be a little more manageable
or understandable.

&gt;The factory harness does not appear to have been hacked really, there is
&gt;just alot of stuff unplugged. It has a standard relay, but I see no &quot;black
&gt;box&quot;. Should I have one? It is a 63 model that has been converted to 12v.

There is no 9 prong box, which I think is what you mean by &quot;black box&quot;.
If it's a US-spec model with hazard flashers (red knob on the dash),
you should only have the turn signal flasher (round metal can) and
the hazard relay (squarish metal box with 4 prongs).  On my '64 Standard,
the flasher is immediately to the left of the fuse panel, and the hazard
relay is mounted to the bottom front (FIF) edge of the parcel shelf, about
halfway between the heater duct and the passenger door.

&gt;I'm ready to spring for the Bentley manual, where do I buy one? 

Most of the usual suspects have them for sale - the big mail-order 
places and the folks on the list.  Since you have 2 Buses that will
be covered by this book, it's an even better idea.  One problem,
though...the reprint is all B/W, no color wiring diagrams.  So,
check out http://www.vintagebus_dot_com/wiring/index.html for scanned
color diagrams.

&gt;Can I look at my 67 Westy and copy the wiring? 

Not directly.  Probably better to go by the factory diagram.

&gt;My buddy has a 63 SC, can I rob the &quot;black box&quot; from it or does 
&gt;it need to be a 12v model?

I don't think you have a &quot;black box&quot;, but if you do decide to replace
some widget, make sure the new one is 12v.  Most widgets (relays,
etc) have the voltage marked on them.

Good luck!
