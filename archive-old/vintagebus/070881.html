Subject: Re: [VB] Popping out of 4th

That's true for all gears.  It just happens in 4th quicker because you use
4th gear the most.

Andrew
'67 Deluxe bus


&gt;    The reason is that they rest there hand on the shifter while in 4th.
This
&gt; causes friction on the 4th gear slider and shift fork causing excessive
&gt; friction and heat which prematurley where's the sliders out.
&gt;    When people do the bungee cord thing or hold them in 4th this is even
&gt; causing more wear which takes even more life out of the trans.
