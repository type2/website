Is it in gear?

Can you see if it's hitting on the bellhousing?

I don't think you can put the clutch disk in backwards, can you?

Did you use too long of a bolts on the tranny mounts?

Did you take the flywheel lock off?

Did you use the proper pressure plate?  Throwout bearing?

Is the clutch arm stuck in the &quot;engaged&quot; position?

&gt; engine wouldn't turn.  (with starter or with wrench on the generator
&gt; nut).  It would turn partially but then clunk and stop.  So I pulled it
