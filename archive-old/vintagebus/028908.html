Subject: Engine update

My flywheel came in late yesterday, so once I got things in order at
work, I punched out and put my engine back together. I set the endplay
at 0.004, got the flywheel bolted back on, cobbled together a 009 with
points and  condensor, adjusted the new Kennedy pressure plate, got
everything installed and wired and plumbed...

After a few turns to get some gas to the carbs, it fired right up... The
clutch is now working properly, too. I twiddled with the carbs and got
it to idle, checked the timing (max advance 30 deg.), fiddled with the
carbs a little more... I was satisfied, so I punched back in and went
back to work.

I was looking forward to test driving the new engine home, and didn't
turn on the radio as I usually do.

By the time I'd gone a couple of miles, the engine didn't want to idle
at the stoplights, and the oil light would come on if the rpm's went
less than 1100 (my estimate), and it seems to be running pretty hot. I
got it home, but I'm not very happy with the test drive... Also, it
doesn't seem to have the &quot;oomph&quot; it had before it broke down in NC,
before putting in the new bearings and Kadron carbs and Engle cam and
new lifters and springs and flywheel and engine compartment seal and ALL
of the sheetmetal, etc...

I'm going to put a timing light on it and make sure the dizzy advance
didn't get stuck or something. I'd love to hear any other suggestions...
