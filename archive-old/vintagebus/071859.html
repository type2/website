&gt; i heard a guy in my vw club say to fill in unwanted holes in the bus to 
&gt; just weld in some nails and then sand em smooth. will this work?

Hi Josh,
That will work, but make sure to use nails that are not galvanized.  
Otherwise you can affect or even kill your liver with the fumes.  We have welded up 
small 1/4&quot; or smaller holes with just the wire feed welder we have.  Either way 
take your time and do not over heat one are which will cause warping of the 
sheet metal.
