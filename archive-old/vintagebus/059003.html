Subject: RE: [VB] Bus sighting at REI

I kayaked with one of the owners many years ago,
when I had my '64 Deluxe.  

He's definitely worthy of owning a very nice bus, 
even if it is lowered.

Really nice guy, understated, and a good kayaker,
uses, abuses, and tests his products in real
world conditions.

There is nothing like loading a kayak onto a deluxe
with the sunroof open . . . it's sooooo easy.
I've had seven kayaks with at least as many
bodies on that bus.  The only way to go.

That and the wind thru the hair is why I like sunroofs.
The little windows are OK, but that's all.

Missing &amp; wishing I still had my '64.
Any sunroof standards out there for sale?
I don't want the fancy stuff, utility is my game

I think this came up a month or so ago. That guy owns Yakima and it's
his bus...

I just went to my local REI store to spend my yearly
refund, and spotted the new Yakima catalog with a
split bus on the cover!  They make top racks for
hauling bikes and other stuff.

I scanned the covers of the catalog, for anyone who
wants to see it, but doesn't feel like driving to your
local REI store.

Is this a listee's bus?  And who's the guy on the
back?
