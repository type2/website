Hi Jeff,
It sounds like the clutch release bearing is going out.  We like to remove
this bearing about every20,000-30,000 miles when ever we happen to have the
engine out and apply some grease into it to avoid noise and later problems.
Just remove the thin steel cover off the forward side of the bearing and add a
small amount makes a big difference.  Eric &amp; Barb
