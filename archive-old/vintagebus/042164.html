Basically, you want everything to be full before the pistons start getting
whacked by the fuel.  Get everything as full as possible, remove the
center wire from the distributor cap, and crank the engine until the oil
light goes out, then crank it for a few seconds more.  Reinstall the wire
and fire it up!

If you have an option, install the spin-on filter upright and fill the
filter with oil before installing.  if you put the filter at the same
level as the oil pump/gallery and run the lines lower than that oil will
remain in the lines when the filter is removed.

&gt; I don't know really how much oil I should put in the bus now that there is a

&gt; on, but then there's a little over four feet of oil-line to fill up, too.
