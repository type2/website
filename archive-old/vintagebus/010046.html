&gt; Erin,
&gt; Why go through all of the hassle of fabbing your own manifolds when VW
&gt; already did it for you on the 72 to 74 Busses?
&gt; Britt's Hillcountry Water Treatment

Well good point Britt in part.  With the conversion to an upright setup, you
can't run the manifolds like VW did but the good part to your message is
that if I went with VW heads, I could hack the manifold attachments off and
use that to fabricate my own mount!!!  Good thinking man - I totally bombed
on that one.  I think this manifold was steel too so bingo!  That answers
the question!!!
