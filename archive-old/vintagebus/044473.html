Subject: Re: [VB] 1967 Master Cylinder

I am in the process of converting my 67 to use a 71 master cylinder. 
My bus is an early 67 so it currently has the single circuit type. 
You might think about doing the conversion as well. It would be a lot 
cheaper. Here is the site that details what needs to be done:

-Rocky                             (...)

&gt;Anyone have a 1967 used, (but working) Master Cylinder for sale? Or know
&gt;where to get one? I was pretty surprised to see what the new ones for this
&gt;year were going for. It's part number 211 611 011Q and is a dual type of
&gt;master cylinder. Thanks for any and all help!
