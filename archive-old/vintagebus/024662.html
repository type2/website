&gt; &lt;&lt; Just when my bus was running great, my fuel pump sprang a leak and dumped a
&gt; great deal of gas into the crankcase. I found out when I went to adjust the
&gt; valves and got a bath when I pulled the valve cover. So, two days ago my bus
&gt; ran great and now it doesn't run too great.

I've just been glancing at this thread, but it seemed odd to me, so I
thought I would read it more closely.

Do you *KNOW* that it was your fule pump dumping gasoline in the
crankcase? If so, how?

I would bet that you have a rich running problem/ stuck choke/ bad
needle and seat or the like. That would explain why you again have poor
running... you again have gasoline in the crankcase.

I would also respectfully disagree with Craig Sauls that an electric
fuel pump solves this problem. In some cases, I would say that the
electric pump is to blame. Some of the typeIV engined buses, (1.7 l)
that had the dual 32pdsit carbs and whose owners choose to put on an
electric pump a la the later FI 1.8 and 2.0 litre typeIV engines will
experience this. This is why you often see the pressure regulator
installed with an electric pump, whether rotary pump or facet pump, so
that it doesn't pump too much gasoline and flood the engine case through
the intake manifold. Those rings are doing their best to keep the oil
in, but gasoline is so thin it goes right past.
