Subject: 8 Track / Radio Switch

Hey everybody:

I am getting ready to install the underdash 8 track player in my VW and I 
can't seem to find anyone who offers a switch I need for it to work with the 
dash mounted AM/FM radio. It switches the speakers between the two devices.

Radio Shack has discontinued the 270-045A switch that is used for this 
application. Here is a diagram of how it works:

Does anyone out there know of an electronics business that still makes or 
stocks something like this? Maybe some old surplus auto electronics place 
might have something.
