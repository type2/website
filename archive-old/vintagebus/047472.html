&lt;&lt;       Anyone know of any good logging roads or otherwise not paved roads 
 through   un-urbanized areas? I have the hankering for some off the beaten 
 path adventures, and maybe even some river crossing?

near Oly there are lots, Capitol Forest has miles and miles, just make sure 
you fill up your tank before you go, easy to get lost.   After I went camping 
in Capitol Forest and driving ~40 miles on rutted roads I realised a squeak 
when I went over bumps, greased the suspension and the squeak went away.  

Consult a local map?
