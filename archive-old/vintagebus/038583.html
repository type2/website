Excellent...just what I wanted to hear :)  I have the Bently, just not in
front of me (i'm at work) but i'll take a look at it.  So in order to
replace it, I have to drop the engine and slide the trans out a little to do
so, right? The trans is also whining quite a bit, and now in fourth, makes
sort of a bubbling/gurgling sound.  Needs a rebuild? Back to my other
question. What trans do I get? Will a new Rancho from Ronnie solve this? I
know I can't just shove a new one in there and drive off...so what is
involved on my end in terms of getting the old one out and the new one in?
Thanks.

&gt; Do you have one of the repair manuals?
&gt; 
&gt; The front mount is a rubber-centered, sorta rectangualr thing.  The
&gt; transmission bolts to it, then it bolts to the body.  The rubber and
&gt; adhesive deteriorate over time, and it comes unglued.   When it does,
&gt; the weight of the engine on the transmission causes the front of the
&gt; transmission to lift.  This puts strain on the coupler, and nose cone.
&gt; If left too long, it will crack the nose cone, bend the shift rod,
&gt; and possibly damage the shift selector.
&gt; 
&gt; To replace it, you will need to slide the transmission back about 3&quot;
&gt; or so.  Ideally, you should replace the coupler, front mount, and the
&gt; two rear mounts all at the same time.  You could also do the axle boots
&gt; while you're at it.  Yes, it's a solid afternoon of greasy work, but
&gt; you won't have to worry about this stuff for a while!
