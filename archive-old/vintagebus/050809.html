Subject: Re: [VB] Electric fuel pump

I have one, because my case is from a fuel-injected bug so there is no mount
for a mechanical one. It's old and I'll be replacing it soon. Mine isn't
really mounted. It's just in-line and held up by the firmness of the fuel
hose, and it sits just to the left of the engine. Let me know which one you
choose.

Subject: [VB] Electric fuel pump


&gt; I was thinking about using an electric fuel pump in my bus.  I think Cal
&gt; Grant had one in his '67 mounted to the left of the engine.  Anyone else
&gt; mounted an electric pump in the engine compartment?  Or anywhere else?
