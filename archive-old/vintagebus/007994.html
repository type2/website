Hi JTB,

Also, check to see if the aluminum threads from the head are still in the
threads of the spark plug. If they are, Ouch! If they aren't, thank heavens!

&gt;
&gt; Hi JTB,
&gt; Not knowning what year engine or bus you have we can not say for sure what
&gt; the spark plug thread size should be.  All you really need to do is take
one
&gt; of your spark plugs down to a threaded supply shop like &quot;Tacoma Screw&quot; and
&gt; make sure to get a tap for your size in a HSS (High Speed Steel) tap.
&gt; Whichever size it is do not use a Heli-Coil, unless it is in an area you
&gt; practicly never take apart.  In the case of spark plugs the Heli-Coil all
too
&gt; often comes out with the spark plug and does not always thread back in!
Try
&gt; Time-Sert on the web for solid inserts that will give you no troubles!
