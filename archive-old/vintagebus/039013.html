Subject: WTB - pair of manifolds
Date: Tue, 15 Dec 1998 09:02:36 -0600

Wanted:  1 pair of manifolds to mount dual Weber 40 IDFs on a type1,
dual port motor.

I don't need the carbs (although if you've got a pair at a really good
price I'd consider them).  I could use a linkage as well, but can
probably scrounge one here if I have to.
