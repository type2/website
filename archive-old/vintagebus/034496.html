Just got the newsletter from the Golden Gate VVWCA
with preliminary information on the Spring Meet.  

I quote from the newsletter:

&quot;We are eliminating the modified classes and will no
longer have awards for these classes...We also decided
that we would only let show cars inside the park, this
means no general parking, no non VW's, no dealers, no
New Beetles, etc. We will still have swappers but will
be more selective on sponsors and vendors.&quot;

The date is set for April 22, 2001

cool.  I thought it was lame that I couldn't bring my bus in the place when 
there were waterbugs in there.     Just cause I didn't get in line hours 
before opening time.  

Wonder what this mean for club stuff though, like the SVT booth there was 
last year.

there was an immense number of people wanting to bring their cars in last 
year, and at one point they said- full no more, and people who brought some 
really nice old VWs to show were not let in.  Remember, you do not have to 
have a 100point resto to show your old bus.    So this is the club's way of 
dealing with the pressure, even though I am sure they would like to let 
general parking and the family picnic style continue.    Sounds better to me 
than moving to a huge parking lot style place.    Check the archives from 
April for reports on Kelley Park 2K.

 you can still take yr slammed  and chopped neon pink bus with white velour  
with hot pink vinyl inserts interior, big stereo and chromed motor  to Sac 
bug a rama.
