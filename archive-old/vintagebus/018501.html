the theories behind oil are many...all i know is what i have beeen using...for
a little over two years without any problems-that could be attributed to the
type of oil i am using-Castrol 30W.

I decided to use this oil as the previous owner was using it and recommended
it...and said to just use that oil-don't change it.
