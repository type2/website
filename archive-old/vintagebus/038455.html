I would like to offer a holiday gift to the list.  I think for more than a
few of us, this list has more of our &quot;Friends&quot; than those who we live near
and work with.  You might consider that sad, I don't.

Typically when something comes up for sale on the list, the first to respond
gets first dibs.  As some of you know, I sometimes have technological
advantages and have gotten some scores.  Least of which is my 1963 Double
Cab at http://www.i405_dot_com/VW/63Crew/ that 4 months ago belonged a former
listee looking to purchase his own home.

It is somewhat hard to quantify who would allow me to call them a friend.  I
think the recent discussion on Josh shows that the lines aren't think --
knowing of someone's struggle with their bus is sometimes enough to say
&quot;friend&quot;.

  Gift 1:   For three people.  I will offer 3 hours of my time, for any
purpose you desire.  I ask 24 hours notice and evenings (6:30pm to midnight)
are best, of course -- weekends too.  Anywhere within Need a ride the
airport?  Need a parts run?  Need helping pulling an engine?  Need help with
your Windows 95 / Windows 98 / Windows NT computer?  Want me to take digital
photos of a long-distance bus purchase in my area?  Borrow tools?
  Gift 2:  For one person.  For someone doing bus work but short cash right
now -- I will pay up to $120 for items at Bus Depot.  Go ahead and p-mail me
with your project and parts you need.
  Gift 3: For one person.  Hoover sermon CD-ROM.  Although don't all respond
just for this one :)

I don't' care if I don't know you, all the better.  The point of this is to
get to know you and have an impact on your personal life.  This isn't an
attempt to buy a friend, this is just an attempt to further a personal
relationship when things like distance and 

I know this is a little odd, as I'm expecting you to respond to me and make
the next step.  This is my first time too :)  If the idea doesn't fly, that
is OK too.  Just respond by p-mail to keep the broadcast to the minimum.

P.S.  At this time I'm only posting this to vintagebus _at_ type2_dot_com .. I
think there are enough here to respond to my personal offer.  If you too
feel so compelled to give a gift to the list, perhaps you should try the
other list to meet that new friend.
P.S.S.  My point isn't to get gifts back from the person that I give them to
-- I've gotten plenty from other strangers who have done things for me.
Don't worry, it all comes back around.
