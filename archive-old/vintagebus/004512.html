&gt;I signed-up in August, but haven't seen my name on the map...because
&gt;Canada isn't there....
&gt;I know there are a lot of bus owners up here, and we get more than our
&gt;share of visitors from south of the border...Quebec has a huge following
&gt;as well.....lets expand this thing to include all of us....K?


Just got the above e-mail message from someone.....Canada has been on the
AIRS site since at least August...in case anyone else failed to see it, its
located in the link box right above the U.S. map along with Germany, New
Zealand, and others. I made the whole Canada map with the idea that there
was a &quot;huge following&quot; in Canada. I think I even put places on the Canada
map where ppl dont even drive cars... but yet I only received 8 entrys. Show
your support for Canada and go sign up! :)
