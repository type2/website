&lt;&lt; When I loosen the side covers should I pull the tube right out and replace 
the gasket and O-ring that way,  or should the whole redux box come off of 
the tube ie.&gt;&gt;
Hi Jdd,
Take off the outer RGB half and then remove the upper axle tube.  When 
reassembling make gaskets and set each upper axle tube with enough gaskets to 
let them move up and down without binding, but not too loose.  Then take each 
apart again and finger paint each gasket with high temp silicon when 
assembling everything back together again.  The large O-rings type of axle 
tubes are rare and the O-rings are NLA.  Eric&amp;Barb
