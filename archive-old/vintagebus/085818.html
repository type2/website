Subject: Re: [VB] IS EVERYONE INSANE- or what? 

You will miss ME? Naw, actually I already miss y'all and the involvement in the
VW thing. Just like the old days I like to put the cat into the bag and shake
it up once in a while. And no, I was sober when I wrote the OG message of this
thread.
Thanks for all of the pmails. =) Got messages from as far as UK, Down-unda,
Europe and the God's farming country of California central valley. Glad to know
that you old sods are still kicking. Cheers to/with a NewCastle on that one,
eh?

Me go away? Naw, I will continue trolling aircooled VWs like a preacher on a
porn site. As a trend I find it dangerous that just as soon as a swear that I
will &quot;never&quot; get back into ACVWs an oppty comes along. I'm not reformed, I'm
just working on my 1 year chip. As I recall I sold my last ACVW less than a
year ago. May?-June? &quot;Hi, My Name is Jim, I'm an Aircooled Addict.&quot; (hi Jim,
welcome to the meeting. Coffee and bagels in the back...)

BTW: I still have a ticket or two in the safe deposit box for that notchback to
be raffled at the Kelly Park Event. I deserve to win it. What say you?
