Subject: Yet another Jerome Trip Report
Date: Thu, 17 Sep 1998 23:07:47 -0700

Well, I had taken the week after Labor Day off work to get my bus running
again (spun fan) with the subconscious intent of getting up to Jerome for
the first time. On Thursday I broached the subject with my ever-patient, VW
hating wife. [Hey honey -- wanna go up to Jerome this weekend? Wanna take
the bus?] To my surprise, she agreed. Friday was spent adjusting the brakes,
putting on the door panels I got for Fathers day, and of course if you got
the door panels off, you gotta pull and clean the locks and renew that
little spring that lets you unlock the door if you accidently pull the
trigger before turning the key. Then getting all the camping eq that hasn't
been used in a couple of years down from the top of the garage, finding the
mice had eaten the food bag, cleaning cleaning. I made it to bed about
12:30, Joey made it in about 3.

Got up at 4:30 to get everyone up, packed, iced and on the road at 6 so we
could make it across the Valley to meet up with the caravan at 7. Pulled in
at 5 till and got in line behind a clean '70 camper with 'MOMBUS' plates.
Didn't even shut off the engine -- pulled out again in 10 minutes and off we
went.

First strech was uneventful...the road is fairly flat. Met up with a bevy of
mid-50's Chevys going up the hill. Long line of old busses on the right;
shiny Bel-Aires zipping by on the left. Hit Big Bug Creek and shift into 2nd
for a couple of miles before topping out at Sunset Point, and the first
cool-down. Filled this rather large rest area with busses. After registering
and availing myself of the last flush facilites, we head back up the road.
The people working on highway litter cleanup stop and wave as we head by.

Stopped again in Prescott Valley to allow the caravan to ice up, beer up,
etc. I'm getting antcy at this point...too many stops. We head out again,
this time in order of precedence .. splits first, then other busses, then
anyone else.  Head up 89A...this time we tend to back up traffic a bit more,
since we're on a 2-lane and the locals in the pickups zoom by in the
oncoming lane. Up and over the mountain, then down toward Jerome, hoping no
one is toasting their brakes.

Hit the turnoff to the mine, and get caught in the long line....they're
making sure all can make it up that steep hill without rolling back into
someone else. Finally it's our turn and we chug right up and around the
corner, and there's at least five acres of busses.  Pull into a space near
the edge of the lot, near the big pile of tailings.
Glad we got a flat spot, some of the caravan behind us end up parking along
the road, at a rather steep angle.


Had a good time all in all -- gave most of my spending money to Jim
Thompson, didn't win anything in the raffle, but Willow had a good time
checking over the tickets and tossing the losing ones into the raffle bus.
Met some nice people -- not too many list people, other than the guys in the
v_at_l t-shirts. Spent a lot of time in my director's chair, sucking on my pipe
and/or a beer and watched the old hippies and the young whatever you call
them, all getting along rather well. We appreciated whoever snuck the
fireworks in. We did not appreciate whoever was rolling rocks down the
tailing pile and struck our neighbor's bus. We felt the pain of the guy in
the CRX who came flying down the road by us and left his oil pan on a rock.

Things to do next year.

--Get out and meet more people. Look for fellow listies.
--Enter the chili contest.
--Buy more raffle tickets.

I'd recommend this event to all, but I don't know where they'd put any more
people. Maybe down by the road by the Big Hill, but that's a long walk
between sites.

Enough rambling. Charlie Ford I ain't.
