Amen, brother Kabayo!

I have fiddled and diddled with a bunch of aftermarket junk for my VW's and
Honda in the past and most of it is junk.  

I had all the performance goodies on my bus engine at one point and they
have all basically gone away in favor of the stock stuff.  In a bus you want
bottom end torque not high RPM power.  Also I am pretty light on the gas too
which does not help if you are running a &quot;hot&quot; setup.

Basically what I have learned is to:
Keep your heat flaps and thermostat
Ditch the 009
30/31 carb is good jetted rich
Baby Webers really are pretty good if you need more power (you can still run
a vacuum dizzy)
Swivel feet valve adjustment screws
Full flow oiling is great (I cheat and run a CB Maxi 3 pump cover - works
just as good but will not support a oil cooler)
Stock exhaust is good for low end torque...  It looks more ridiculous than
it really is :)
The pre heater air intake tube is very good!
Oil bath filters are great.
SS valves are good for long life
C/W crank is very important on any engine rebuild

Basically stock is not that bad!  My bus is pretty quick too.  

Everyone bitchez about going fast....  How fast do you want to go in a bus
anyway?  They are not the safest vehicles in the world to be hauling ass in!

If you want a car to go fast in, buy a fast car to begin with.  Used
Corvettes, 911s, 914s, 300Zs, Ferrari 308, M3s, etc really are not that
expensive if you look at the money some of these ricers are dumping into
worthless Civics and Nissans.... Hmmm, I can buy a car that is designed to
kick butt or get a Civic dump $15K into it and still have a POS.  BTW
anything front wheel drive is going to suck if you are looking for real
performance.... If you disagree go to the race track and run a few laps.  I
still think the 914 is the best kept sports car secret.
