Can they do it in any other media?  Soda ash?  Plastic media?

The #80 will tear up the metal pretty good.  I only use it on
rusty surfaces myself.  I've used walnut shells, and it's amazing
how delicate they are.  I used them to remove successive layers
of paint from a friend's Datsun Roadster.  The only problem I
had was the media size wasn't very regular, meaning I kept having
big chunks of oversized media clogging my nozzle.

&gt; insisting that they can use silica (somethin about 80 grit) sand on my panel
&gt; and not have ANY warpage cause they are just so damn skilled etc etc
&gt; So what do I do? are they just bs'ing me? Anyone ever silica blasted a
&gt; panel? Got prices from 250 to 400. Anyone have any thoughts on this matter?
