&gt; Has anybody else had a little trouble getting the link pin dust covers to go 
&gt; on?  The diameter seems to be just a tad large.  I tried freezing them a 
&gt; bit, still no go.  I'll file the edges down a little today, and then put 
&gt; them in the freezer, and see if I can get them to go.  Anybody have any 
&gt; suggestions?  

Hi Mike,
Those you do have to hammer into place since they are made for a press fit!  
Just try to not dent the dome of the link pin covers when doing this.  A raw 
hide hammer works well, hard rubber hammer next and your normal steel hammer 
will work when used with care.
