Subject: Pomona

With the threat of rain  the crowd was down--The &quot;treasures&quot; were there
for those that wanted to look--Found a mint 1960 Porsche 356B factory
repair manual   still in the bottom box!!--this was bought in the Non-VW
area--One VW vender had A LOT of EMPI and early vintage VW stuff--prices
were high I thought--Counted at least 5 early shift extenders for your
bus, are they breeding??? There is someone producing them--but these
were original. An interesting story in the For Sale area--Nice Splitty
was being negotiated on Friday night--price was down to under
$5800----but sold for $7000 to someone else the next day!! Sometimes
your best deal is the one you do not make.
High Roof was for sale by Paul--i do not think it was sold--I had to
make room in my garage-so i sold  2 vintage 20&quot; bikes--a pedal car--and
3 ice chests--i have found  bad weather is good sale weather?--Theft
again the topic--we stopped one theft in progress--
but then later a nice bus horn button disappeared! Best deal i heard was
someone found a folding bus ladder for $10!!  Keep looking --They are
always out there!!
 Many thanks for the response on my request for help in Aurora
Colorado!! The Problem was finally resolved--thanks for all your
interest  TWWM, uj
