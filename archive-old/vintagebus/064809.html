Subject: high speed engine miss

Ok, I found the problem.  First, thanks to all for
your help.  I learned a lot.

The problem was the left craburetor.  I pulled the
right one, cleaned needle valve and passage, the main
jet, checked the float valve where I had to re-set the
rivets holding the float mechanism on, and reassembled
making sure to tighten everything.  I ran it out on
the street where it did the same thing, it began
running rough at about 45mph in fourth.  Then I did
the same thing to the left carb.  I wasn't too hopeful
when I took it out for the test drive,  but low and
behold, she picked right up with out a hint of a
stumble.  

One other note, I'm strapped for cash and this repair
ended up costing zero dollars.  What a break.  Thank
you all very, very much.
