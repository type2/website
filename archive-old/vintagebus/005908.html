Subject: Re: [VB] Westy birch and bus roof racks

    My friend and I just finished making the roof panels for his 63 Westy.
It took us about 7 hours to cut and fit the panels in the roof alone.( and I
have done this several times before).That is not including sanding and
varnishing, which is the time consuming part.
    The reason it was so difficult is that the European sized( 5' x 5' )
Baltic birch that is now available is ever so slightly thicker,causing it to
be a b!tch to fit between the roof supports and the lip.The side panels are
much easier to contend with.
    The Baltic birch is available at specialty lumber yards for $20 to $30
per sheet. The long drivers side panel is not available as far as I
know.Lenny had them specially made for him.
     I just got finished making wood panels for the cab doors of my
4( tired of warped WW panels).It took approx. 12 hours of cutting
drilling,sanding,varnishing,sanding.........It's time consuming work. (Plus
24 hours of drying time between coats.)
    Bottom line, if you don't want to mess with it you now can order them
.You have a choice !!

&gt; I think you've over-simplified it a bit.
&gt;
&gt; Home depot doesn't carry the correct stuff; neither species of wood,
&gt; grain or size.  You need European sized sheets to be able to do the
&gt; roof pieces, as 'merkin 4x8 isn't large enuf.  Also, you gotta give some
&gt; for the cutting and finishing.  RVB can be more specific.
