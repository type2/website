That bus frea*ing rocks!
I believe hes running a 1600SP with a straight axle rear end.
Fronts hes got a adj. front bean and dropped spindles.

&lt;&lt;Jp and list,
Barry called me to tell me all about the fun week end at the Classic. He also 
said that Cletus had his TV bus set up to run down the high way at 85 mph all 
day long. Do you know if he has a web page on the TV bus? Or do you know the 
mods to it?
Thanks
Kerry
