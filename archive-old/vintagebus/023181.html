&gt;We have returned to the high desert of So. Ca. after having a good invisible

have

&gt;than we remembered and it took two days to drive 450 invisible miles
&gt; Thanks  the meet Taylor ( you not a geography major are you ?)

Nope...English major! :)  And I never knew exactly where in So Cal you were
from, so I didn't want to totally risk offending. ;)  I can imagine how
