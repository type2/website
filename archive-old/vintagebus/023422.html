Subject: Bob Wallace &amp; 1998 Brazilian Bus with VW factory King + Link pin

In January I wrote to Bob Wallace, as I was asking about the general
configuration of his new 1998 VW Bus that he had imported to the UK and
retrofitted as a camper by Devon.  One thing he mentioned as a difference
was &quot;king and link pin front axle with vacume disk brakes&quot;... now this
caught my attention!

Barb &amp; Eric and many others have advocated upgrading the front end of my
1963 and earlier truck to 1964+ with the larger drum surfaces.  Now I've
debated this, but decided that if I was going to really re-do it I would
consider disc brakes... but I don't hear much about disc brakes, and we are
talking non-stock change, so I figured I was in no hurry.

Now Steve Howell and I had a discussion about front brakes and tools, going
over a 1960 front beam I had purchased from Steve, and I mentioned to him
that somewhere down in Brazil VW appeared to be producing &quot;king and link pin
disc brakes, for a loaf bus!&quot;  Steve had never heard of this either... and I
said I would start a thread on the topic.

VW Brazil, or whatever you want to call them, appears to produce a King &amp;
Link Pin vacuum disk brake system.  Bob Wallace is an active listee on the
loaf list, and he drives his bus with these brakes.  Bob seems more than
willing to share information, but I don't know enough as to what to ask.

Anyone out there have some ideas how we can find out about these?  Research
possible compatibility with split-window bus front beam?

I know that importing from Brazil and so forth isn't trivial, but I think
this is at least worth a discussion -- at least to get some technical
details on how they were engineered.  With Brazil's economic problems in the
last 8 months, perhaps there is hope for an opportunity?

Thanks.
