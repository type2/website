PLEASE REFRAIN FROM POSTING TO THE LIST ANY SPECIFIC QUESTIONS REGARDING 
A.I.R.S.!  

If you have an A.I.R.S related story please post them on Friday.  I made 
the commitment to the admin when A.I.R.S. was first announced.  These 
guys work hard to take care of this list, and though I may not always 
agree with their decisions, I respect their motivation and efforts.  

If you do have any questions about A.I.R.S. please write to either me, 
Wade, or Mike personally.  

Our addresses are:

Charlie---------- cjford_at_altamaha_dot_net
Wade-------------wades-wagens_at_home_dot_com
Mike--------------jjmnoble_at_email.msn_dot_com

Now on to the next topic of VW Bus ownership!
---------------------------------------------------
The address for ordering A.I.R.S. shirts is included in the original post 
but for the sake of patience and understanding I will include it in this 
post.  I don't always read the whole post either.  : )

TO ORDER A.I.R.S. Shirts!

SEND YOUR CHECK OR MONEY ORDER TO:
Mike Noble
%AIRS T-Shirts
812 North Columbus
West Liberty, IA 52776

A.I.R.S. LOGO CAN BE SEEN AT http://www.type2_dot_com/rescue/main.html

YOU MUST BE AN A.I.R.S. MEMBER TO ORDER.   (All said hoping you will go 
to http://www.type2_dot_com/rescue/main.html and sign up.)  We will verify 
all names on December 10th.  If your's is not there the we will send your 
check or MO back to you or tear it up.

Shirts cannot be ordered on the website but it's sure a groovy thing to 
look at.  Go in, browse the maps, see how many graciously groovy 
benevolent VW folks have signed up to be there for you should you bust a 
bus on a  haphazard midnight driving adventure.  All we (the membership) 
ask in return is your commitment to do the same if we call in a moment of 
VW desperation.

The A.I.R.S. Website-----------http://www.type2_dot_com/rescue/main.html  (GO 
SIGN UP!)

POST FROM THIS POINT ON SHOULD BE PLACED IN FRIDAY.....PLEASE.

Thanks for tolerating,

Charlie Ford
