Subject: Most functional Camper Floor Plan

So ... is there any sort of consensus as to the best camper floor plan.  I 
was going to fit parts of a SO 69 and 62 Devon into my 60 ... now I'm not so 
sure.  I'm cutting in a Dorper (a 70's Canadian conversion company) top onto 
my 60 - (it's a bit bigger than a small westy top and goes straight up). 
Now I'm thinking about cabinets - as I say - I was planning on an SO 69 
behind the bench seat cabinet ... but now ... not so sure.

Anyone have any ideas as to what is absolutely most functional floor plan.

jdd (I love the floor plan in my 78 westy but my 60 is non-walk through)
