&gt; Hi, I have a 65' Splitty that I'm restoring. When I was taking it
&gt; off the trailer that we transported it on, the brake pedal gave way,
&gt; and went from having pressure to none at all. The pedal just goes to
&gt; the floor, and will stay there unless I flip it back up with my shoe
&gt; or something. Now I know that this could be a couple of things,
&gt; master cylinder, wheel cylinders. I plan on replacing all the
&gt; hydrolic parts of the system in the near future, but don't have
&gt; enough money for them right now. I am placing a order for parts
&gt; today, so I can work on it on my vacation next week, and was hoping
&gt; that someone might have expierenced this before and could tell me
&gt; what it could be so I can order the part.....

well like you said, could be the master cyl, a wheel cyl, even busted
brake line. I would just guess master cyl. What you need to do is go
around &amp; pull the wheel hubs off. Check each wheel cyl. If all are dry
&amp; the flexable hoses going to them are not leaking there is a very
good chance that it's your master cyl. 

I suppose you could check the fluid level &amp; then just pump the pedal a
lot &amp; see if the level goes down (would indicate a leak) or if the
system just never creates pressure to begin with (indicate a master
cyl problem). I personally wouldn't drive it any untill I found the
cause of the lack of pressure, but I'm sure you agree with this.
