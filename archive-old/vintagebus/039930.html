writes:  &lt;&lt; Wonder how much a 1680 is? I like that
&gt;setup but rarely see it. You get the reliability of a 1600 with thicker p/c
&gt;then a 1641. Anyone doing that???  Jason &gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Hi Jason,
&gt;Clara is putting one of those together to try out with her 3.875 R&amp;P 
&gt;freeway


And from looking at her case, I hope things work out. A little more cutting 
and it might be alright? I hope so.

There are two things about these we do not like about them.
&gt;1.  If you have a piston or cylinder problem on a long trip you might have 
&gt;to
&gt;wait quite a while for a replacement.

As with any situation dont you think?

Where with 1641 slip in cylinders you
&gt;could just install a set of 1600 P&amp;Cs.  We have over 50,000 miles on our 
&gt;1641
&gt;slip in P&amp;Cs SP engine and probably because we keep the RPMs down and oil
&gt;temp down below 220F at most we have had no problems so far.

I must admit I liked the 1641 myself. Seemed to run a bit hot, but for some 
reason that bus always ran hot. However after I sold it it drove down to 
Cali, and then out to the deserts of Arizona regularly so it couldnt be that 
bad could it? Finally died when the fan belt broke and the &quot;friend&quot; of the 
owner didnt pay any attention to that light. Saw the case afterword, and it 
tossed a rod right threw it.


&gt;2.  The forward area of # 3 cylinder bore in the case is thin with stock
&gt;bore.


This is an interesting point of debate. I agree with what you are saying, 
but its a happens doesnt happen argument among builders.

I know I have been flamed for mentioning this before, but its worth putting 
out there: In oly there used to be a mobile mechanic by the name of Dylan. 
He and I had old mutual friends and I liked him and trusted him. He helped 
me realize some time ago that a top end rebuild was easy, and could be done 
using some very simple tools. Anyways, he was a trained mechanic, and I have 
no reason to doubt his word.
He had a 1973 bus powered by an upright motor, using the euro adapter kit. 
He had a 1641 he put in, and swears he got way over 200,000 miles with that 
set up. Judging by his service calls, his trips, and just his plain attitude 
about the bus, I cant say I doubt it. It was no show bus, but he was all 
over the place. He pulled the heads off, replaced rings occasionally, and 
thats it.
Many people knock the 1641 as getting too hot with too thin barrels, but 
maybe its not the case.
Either way, as I was saying to Clara my next engine will be a VW TDI diesel. 
If the 1776 in there now dies, or the spare 1776 dies, or the spare 1835 
dies!

BTW when the drag bug (1960) finally tells me what its like to drive with a 
big ass motor in it, Ill know wether thats acceptable, or more likely Ill be 
looking to make it a friendly 36 or 40 horse. Why waste money on gas?

Jason
