I found a transport company that seems reasonable, there bringing my 55
Barndoor from Dallas Texas to my doorstep for 550.00 and that's for a non
running bus! It would have been 100 cheaper to Pheonix but I couldn't go to
Pheonix and back for a hundred dollars. I found them by calling Pheonix Auto
Auction and they hooked me up with a company that does nothing but transport
auction cars all over the country. My Barndoor should be here by next
Wednesday, it was loaded in Dallas yesterday

ps. I had to pay someone else to get it from where I bought it to Dallas
though.That was cheaper then having the transport company pick it up, they
charge for a tow truck to winch it on the trailer and stand by time for the
semi driver.

I am in need of moving a bus from Salem Ohio to Phoenix--anyone who knows of
a
reasonable hauler PLMK--this IS a great driver--but i would prefer to have
it
hauled as of the miles involved--hopefully, thanks--TWWM, uj
