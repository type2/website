Subject: 1971 Bus wanted

OK--I know this is not the list for Bay Windows-- But please read on--A good friend of
ours was in a serious car accident with her bus--The bus was destroyed--and Chris suffered
numerous injuries--
After 4 months, she is now close to walking again and needs another bus--She wants a 1971
bus because of the better brakes--If anyone out there knows of a decent 1971 bus PLMK--
PS--By the way she had her spare tire on the front of her bus and it may have saved her
life!! She was on her way for a VW Camping Week-end when another car blew a stop sign--
