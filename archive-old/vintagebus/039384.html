Howdy,
  What radio came with the 67 buses?  In the archives there seemed to be 
some difference. I saw sapphire 3 and 5. Also was there a radio block off 
plate available in 67 and was it different?  I noticed some of the 
aftermaket ones say thru '66.

  Which brings up the &quot;pet peeve of the day&quot;.  Why do so many people refer 
to split busses as pre-67?  Whats wrong with pre-68?  I know the 67 being 12 
V makes a lot of parts different so I don't know whether to take 
advertisements for parts that say pre-67 seriously or not.  Should I seek 
counseling or do you think another cold beer will take care of it?


thanks,
Wayne
