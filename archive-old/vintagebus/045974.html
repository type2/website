&lt;&lt; Question is when was the heating switched from the tube to two vents. I'm
 talking about up front. Mine is a 64 and it has the tube that you turn to
 set it to go on the window or down. All kick panels that I've seen for a 64
 have the openings for vents. Would mine be still equipped as 63? VIN says
 otherwise. Tell me if I'm wrong.
  &gt;&gt;

it was changed april 64, at ch 1 285 211, thus was a mid year change, 
actually near the end of the model year, actually.  So most 64s have the kick 
side to side bit rather than the up and down lever to change from foot to 
defrost heat.  Yes same kick panel used as a 63.   now you will say your vin 
is 800 after that change number, and why is that happening?????
