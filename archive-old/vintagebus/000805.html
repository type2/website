These were very popular in Holland and Belguim at the flower markets and some 
of the outdoor farmers markets

This one looks like a nice display set-up for selling flowers.

I am sure you could order it for whatever you planned on selling....
flowers, fish , cheese or vegies were the most popular items at the outdoor 
markets...

they are rare now as most of them rotted away.........
