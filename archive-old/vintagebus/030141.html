Subject: Running a govenor (65 samba resto)

OK, my bus is suposed to have a govenor below the carb.  I plan to put
on there.  The trouble i am having is that the gov set's the carb (30
pict-1) over 1&quot; taller on the intake manifold (single port).  This seams
to mess up the routing for the accelorator cable.  It has to bend up
more to get to the carb.  Because of this, the carb does not want to
return to the idle location.  I have to put 2 springs on there it sort
of get it to return to idle.  Was there some other setup for the gov?
Different spring?  an i missing something here?

Thanks
MAtt
