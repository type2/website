Subject: Tranny Filler Tool
Date: Tue, 17 Jul 2001 21:06:42 -0500

Here's a little gizmo I just made for filling my tranny.  I have one of
those pumps that you put in a gallon jug of tranny fluid and pump away.  My
plastic nozzle that is supposed to lock the tube in the trans long since
broke.  It kept popping out of the tranny fill hole anyway.

So tonight over supper I'm trying to figure out how to solve the problem and
came up with this:

http://home.ispi_dot_net/~elassley.bie/tools/filler2.jpg
http://home.ispi_dot_net/~elassley.bie/tools/filler3.jpg

The only thing I have left to do is drill some little weep holes in it so
the fluid will come out once the trans is full.  This gizmo is untested but
it looks like it should work.  I drilled out the center of an old plug
(strip them old trannies guys - even locked up ones have useable parts!) and
tapped it.  Took an old piece of copper pipe and cut threads on the outside
of it.  Put the 2 together and there ya go.  All I gotta do is hose clamp my
rubber tubing on this and no more damn pop out spills, splatters, and fluid
in the face.
