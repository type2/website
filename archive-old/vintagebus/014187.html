&gt;Is there something you can immerse into it to do this?

Thom,

I have a local buddy who was recently building parts washers for a while and selling them.  I know that he found a suitable heater, that was also reasonably priced.  He may even have some sitting around....

I have emailed him and will post again as soon as I get the information.
