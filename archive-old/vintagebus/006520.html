hey volks,

me again. i've recently replaced the po installed car tires on my '60 westy
with some goodyear wrangler gl (?) 195/75/R15's and replaced the spare tire
too. well, i didnt give too much thought to where that spare tire is
stored...  so now the bottom of the back of my front bench seat doesn't rest
exactly where it should. at first it felt kinda cool, kinda like a &quot;lumbar
support&quot;... but on long drives it's not so comfortable. btw, my front seat
is the kind where the back of the bench seat flips up to make a child's cot.
any ideas? just thought this may help other putting those big tires on :-)

tony
