&gt; When I was involved in the Porsche 356 world there were 2 concourse classes
&gt; at the shows
&gt; 
&gt; 1.  full concours, this was the trailer queen, no dirt, blades of grass,
&gt; wipe the inside of your wheel wells with white gloves, points off for
&gt; anything that was foreign to the car, etc.  etc..

I've seen the same thing with the Model T crowd.  The judges crawl
underneath to be sure that the various bolts on the undercarriage and
drive train have the correct markings and plating.  Pleh!
 
&gt; 2. street concours. this class was for perfect or near perfect cars that are
&gt; driving even though there were a lot of trailer queens entered in this class
&gt; being they couldn't win or place in the full concurs.

Herein lies the problem.  Most cars in this class and &quot;daily driver&quot;
classes tend to be trailer queens as well, which is unfair to the real
daily-driver folks.  There's no way to police this though.

I have a neighbor who is a Harley freak.  Every year he loads the Hog onto
a trailer, hitches it to his motor home, and heads to the big Harley meet
at Sturgis, SD.  The wheels on that bike don't even touch the road until
it is within 30 miles of Sturgis.  Of course, at the bar he talks about
when he &quot;rode to Sturgis!&quot;

When I told him that my wive and I rode our BMW motorcycle to Sturgis and
beyond a few years back, he looked at me like I was some sort of nut.

Well, none of my vehicles will ever take concours or street concours
honors, but they win a blue ribbon whenever I drive them!

&gt; I have heard  rumors that VW is in the process of creating a similar
&gt; program, this would be awesome, it would insure the quality and fit of a lot
&gt; of repo parts and hopefully weed out a lot of the crap out there.

I hate to think of what it will do to prices, though.

&gt; It would be nice to see some quality judging on our buses being full
&gt; concours (not my thing) or street concours much more dueable for the average
&gt; person with a little patience and perseverance and if that ever did come
&gt; about I feel a lot more of our buses would be restored to a better quality
&gt; and be shown, as long as you DRIVE it.

But, as you said, even street concourse becomes a trailer queen class.
The trailers just get parked a half-mile further from the event.
