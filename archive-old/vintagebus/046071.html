Subject: Carb icing/preheat/thermostats.

 This is merely a description of started a cold bus, and watching the carb 
ice, and somewhat of how the thermostat and preheat systems work.  Also  some 
ideas about it.  If this is boring, please skip it.

The other day I tuned up my 65 westy.   Did the valves etc and then started 
it up to check the timing (I always check the advance, since I have had the 
advance stick a couple times.  Once this was in a bus in the SW desert and t 
got real hot because of this.  I must add at this point that I was a 
passenger in that bus and hadn't done the tuneups on  it)    Anyway, I sat on 
the carpet covered milk crate behind the bus on a non raining day at about 48 
F, and probably 85% humdity.  I watched the ice start to appear  in about 20 
seconds on the base of the carb and on the intake manifold.     Peering 
underneath, the thermostat was closed, and putting my hand in front of the 
muffler I could feel barely any air blowing over the cylinders, even when I 
revved the motor.  (This is what it is supposed to do with a cold motor) 
(more air will go through the heater exchangers and doghouse cooler, but 
there wouldn't be oil circulating through the cooler yet at it is too cold.  
)    Felt the preheat tube, and it was warmer than the fresh air tubes.  the 
heat risers were warm, the manifold was only icing on its throat, not near 
the heat risers.   After 3 minutes had elapsed, the carb was still well iced. 
 at some point there the thermostat opened the flaps enough for I could feel 
the air blowing over the cylinders.  Revving the motor did not affect the 
carb icing.    The air cleaner was warm on the bottom, slightly warm on the 
top, but the tube leading to the carb was not really much warmer.   The ice 
began receding.     At about 5 minutes some the  revving the motor led to a 
visible thawing, (but if I dropped back it idle the thawing was slow) and at 
six minutes there  was liquid condensation only.

FYI, this bus does seem to like to warm up for a couple minutes in the 
morning.  Or it protests with lagging/inadequate pickup for the first mile.

My first split, a 59 with a 1500 and a paper filter, had no preheat, and I 
had to warm it up for 5-10 minutes in the morirng in the winter, or it would 
stall and runs horribly.  I felt awful if I was late and didn't warm it up, 
like I was hurting it.   Probably carb icing.   

Also, as the preheat gets picked up by the head,  it also depends on head 
temperature.   Which is hotter under power than when idling.    There fore 
the ice would met quicker under power than when idling.    If you are in a 
bus with a heaad temp guage, it drops quickly when you are at a stop, and 
rises quickly to circa 350F when accelerating.

FWIW, I have a modified aircleaner on my westy  that takes a 2&quot; tube, and use 
the 68 on style metal preheat pick up.   I found it at a swap, and thought it 
might help de ice quicker.

I hadn't though of it warming the oil bath before, but it makes sense.    And 
thus it has to warm all tha up before it warms up te carb, as all that stuff 
sucks the heat from the preheat. Probably helps with airflow as the oil gets 
thinner with warmth, better bong action?  VW says use 20 wt in the oil bong, 
but I use 30.    Maybe I should go with a thinner oil for the bong?

I put a preheat tube on my bus a few years ago.  I had driven c 850 mi to CA 
to spend Xmas with the family, and the carb was iced all the way  south 
through Oregon, hundreds of miles at freeway speeds.  Each time I stopped for 
gas I would check the oil and once over the engine, and there it was.   ON 
the way back I picked up a preheat tube in Eureka I think, and having no 
pickup pipe I just curled the lower end so it rested on the  tin under the 
push rod tubes facing forwards.    From then on I never saw carb icing when I 
stopped and checked the motor.

I think the late 66/67 style preheat with taking the heated air from the heat 
exchangers may be superior, as it is blown directly into the  system, rather 
than relying only on suction.   In fact, I have a 67 kombi, which amazingly 
has the heater box pick up system, and I can compare.  If I had a third bus 
with the 1&quot; system as well, started them all cold in a line, and compared the 
3, well wouldn't that be interesting.
