Subject: '59 Kombi 1600cc engine....

I slept in this morning and went to work on the engine with a fresh 
head. I took all the fastners off and starated to split the case and 
this allowed me to get the oil pump off a lot easier. I still had to 
use my home made tool to pull it. But it was much easier and came off 
this time.

So then I split the case. I had already noticed that my number 4 rod 
was loose. I assume a bad bearing. This was the area I was hearing 
the knock, &amp; I'm pretty sure that's what it was all about. There 
aren't any obvious signs of other damage yet. But it's SOOOO hard to 
tell 'cause of the dirty condition of the engine. I'm glad I tore it 
down. I can fix the problem and even more clean the heck out of the 
thing. Again, there is absolutely no way this thing was rebuilt. I'm 
positive now that the PO just bought a used engine and slapped it in.

Now the hard part is to figure out what to keep and what to get rid 
of. I'm kinda thinking more along the lines of if it looks good I'm 
not gonna swap it out. I'm totally not interested in breaking the 
bank on this one. Opinions appreciated.
