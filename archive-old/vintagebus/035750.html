Hi NQ,
If you reuse this throw out cross shaft make sure the clips hold the throw 
out bearing snuggly to it, no looseness.  If loose, most likely the cross 
shaft arms held the throw out bearing offset in relation to the tranny input 
shaft.  This causes the throw out bearing to be wiggled side to side which in 
turn wears out the throw out cross shaft arms thinner and thinner until the 
clips become loose and can take less than a month for this to happen.
