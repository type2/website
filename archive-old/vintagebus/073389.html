BTDTGTTS.  My daughters (now 10 and 12) have somehow managed to take long
trips in our bus without the benefit of TVs, VCRs, DVD, or video games.  I
don't even recall them wanting these things.

The key for us is to involve them in the trip.  They aren't just along for
the ride, they help decide where we go and what we do.  If there are
alternate routes, we decide which one to take and they get to help
navigate.  We stop at reasonable intervals and most of the things we go to
see are relatively child-friendly.  On vacation we tend to go 250 miles or
so a day, but when travelling beaten routes that number goes up to
400-450.  During the boring bits of the trip, the children amuse
themselves by drawing, singing (thank goodness that the back seat of a bus
is _way_ back there!) and reading.  They are also pretty fair
navigators and can follow maps as well as I can. These are all activities
that can be put aside as soon as more interesting terrain appears.

Sorry, but I'm not going to have my daughters stuck to a 2-hour movie on
TV when there is a panoramic view of America going by outside!  Nor do
they have to be plugged into video games every waking hour like many
children I see.
