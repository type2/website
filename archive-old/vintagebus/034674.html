&lt;You were told incorrectly.  Order a Birth Certificate from VW and you'll get
a list of M-codes your Bus came with, I did.  Instructions at

Actually, I did write VW and got the Birth Certificate for my '52 when I 
first bought my bus.  In the options area it says &quot;No information available&quot;

I find it all very interesting that nobody seems to agree on or know the 
absolute truth when it comes to this barndoor options issue.  Maybe if 
someone comes fourth with an actually barndoor era list of M-codes or options 
we can figure this all out.  

Everett, could you tell us what M-codes your barndoor's birth certificate 
lists?
