OCTO Moe wrote about the pre-OCTO campout...

I would like to second the motion for camping at
Dustin Retz's prior to the upcoming OCTO meet. Easy to
find, safe/secure, fun and QUIET! Dustin is a very
gracious host and all around nice guy. He didn't know
me upon my arrival but welcomed me in like a long lost
brother. OCTO is truly no more than five minutes away
with a 24/7 Donut/Coffee shop in between.
Easy to find for out of towners.
Unfortunately, I will be unable to attend this time
around.
Have fun!
