Subject: Strassenfest camping and upcoming BNNTA event...

Hi all,

Last night Kathryn and I drove the '59 Double Door Panel out to visit with a
few of the Buskatiers in town for the St. Louis Strassenfest VW event.  Gary
J., Ron L. and Amy and her hubby (damn! I can't remember his name - an airline
pilot!) and their kids (they are from Wenzville) did the Mississippi River
Tour and the ferry crossing and then went looking for a campground.  Because
of the absolutely prefect weather and the crowds at the State park
campgrounds, they ended up at Cherokee Lakes back in the same old area where I
used to host past Busses By The Arch events.  They circled the wagons and were
cooking up pork tenderloins with all the fixin's, so we brought dessert, ice
cream and toppings.  We had a great feast and settled in around the campfire
for great conversation.  We probably solved many of the world's problems last
night, but who can remember today?  What a beautiful night for camping!

Busses Nowhere Near The Arch preparations coming along fine for the upcoming
VW camping weekend.  It's a little less than a month away, so we're pretty
busy getting ready for all of our out-of town VW guests.  If you'd like to
join in on all of the frivolity, go to http://www.bnnta_dot_com for more info and
directions.  We look forward to seeing many old and new friends at the lake
with all of those VW's in a few weeks time!

Enjoy the crap out of your Summer!
