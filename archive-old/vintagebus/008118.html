These are pix in their raw form.  I don't have the time at the moment to
make a nice web page so just view my directory and enjoy the various pix
which include Terry Wolfe's restoration in progress on his 65 Westy, my 66
resurrection, and various other shots that for the moment will have to be
self explanatory.  Keep checking the directory because I'm scanning and
adding photos while I'm sending this message.
