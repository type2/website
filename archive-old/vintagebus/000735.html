 I do have a question or two, HOW DO YOU DRIVE WITHOUT A CLUTCH. I
 haven't had a chance to look back at what Muir said, but figured you
 guys would know more any how. How can you tell when the engine and trans
 are in sync with each other. I tried to go by sound and it worked ok.
 Should you start off in second as oppose to first?
- - - - -
shut the engine off, put the bus in 1st gear, start engine up with plenty of 
gas and also room in front of you.   You shift at the shift points that sound 
best.  just figure it out.
 .....
 Also should I just go ahead and drop the engine to replace the cable? I
 figure it's just as easy to do that as oppose to trying to snake in with
 the engine in the way. I don't know for a fact it's the cable but that's
 what it sounded like, not a throw out arm or something.

well, If the cable broke you have no pedal at the clutch pedal, it drop s to 
the fllor.   Go under the bus in front and look for the end of the clutch 
pedal, to the arm the cable attaches to.   pull on it, like you want to pull 
the clutch.  does the cable come out of the bus?    go under bus,   left side 
just forward of rear left wheel.  find arm on side of tranny.   pull cable 
back.  ?  broken?  or has the arm fallen off the tranny?   If your arm is 
there and you  pull the arm back and you friend says yes the pedal lifts up 
off the fllor then your cable is fine, your arm and cable are fine and I 
would figure the throw out arm (in bell housing) is broken. foir that the 
engine must be pulled.  If it is just the clutch cable you don't need to pull 
the motor.  less work not to.
