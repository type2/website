List
I just came in from cleaning the bus.................. for earlier today we
went to a Mariners game at Safeco field where Seattle beat San Diego 6 to 4.
When we walked out of the stadium (wife son and I) We found a crowd gathered
around the bus, assuming it was the usual crowd of memory lane nostalgia
trippers I didn't think much at first. Then all of  a sudden some long
haired Jesus freak (I can say this because up until about two years ago I
had hair hanging down below my belt)  pops his head up from the open sun
roof and starts rambling on to the crowd about some type of  eternal
damnation fate and that we were all going to hell. Walking closer to the bus
I was at a loss for how I was going to get him out of there. My first
thought was to drag him out by his hair and put the fear of MY GOD in to his
life. But then looking over at my family I realized that this was not a good
idea. Instead I decided to so see if he would stop talking so I could
address him and ask him to exit the vehicle (don't call me a pansy). After
about 5 minutes of his belligerent BS I was forced to locate a cop and have
him removed. The damn thing is, he was doped up pretty good and had pissed
his pants. So as you can guess all the way home my bus smelled like... well
piss.
when I got home I removed the interior and washed the bus down. I scrubbed
the seats and mats, but still can sort of smell it. Does any one have a good
solution to kill this stench. Also If any one has a locking door handle
driver's side for a 63 they want to sell it would be appreciated.
