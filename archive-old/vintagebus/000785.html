Subject: [VB] VW Trends feature and bus mirrors
Message-ID: &lt;0.eed8194e.25996b7d_at_aol_dot_com&gt;

Hi everyone,
I know it's not all that much bus content and I couldn't wait until friday.
I finally got the long awaited feature published of my 1960 ragtop bug. It's 
been so long since the pictures were taken and the article written I've 
actually started driving the car since and is no longer a trailer queen.
So if you look on page 72 of the Feb. issue of Trends you'll see the 3 page 
layout. 
Hope everyone else had a good X-Mas and got lots of VW stuff also.

Bus content
Anyone else have trouble with WCM elephant mirrors snapping off the arms?

Thanks and please let me know what you all think of my converted trailer 
queen to Sunday driver.
