Subject: Is it an ambulance?
Message-ID: &lt;DFD1EF94802BD21181C50060080B9D8F17378B_at_LIMONFS&gt;

Found a bus the other day with a rear door(hatch) that is hinged at the
bottom with no rear window opening. Was this setup specific to the
ambulance or were there other variants with the same?

The interior was stripped and the panel where I had hoped to find the
ambulance fans was missing. Are there any other clues as to whether it
was an ambulance or not.

Reason I want to know is that I believe that ambulances had a close
ratio gearbox(smaller gap between 2nd an 3rd gear) and a taller overall
ratio. Does anyone know if this is true? If it is I would like to take
the tranny out and use it in my doublecab.
