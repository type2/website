&gt; Nothing worse that

&gt; the parts on
&gt; e-Bay when it takes more than planned.

Here here! There is a freak bus that was left on the property of a friend of
mine by a tenant. It is a late seventies bay that was in the process of a
very extensive and professionally executed mid engined smallblock V8
transplant. A huge amount of high quality body work was put into the project
and then it was abandoned. 

What is left over is near useless to anyone who just wants a bus and an
uncertain proposition for anyone who wants a thunderbus.

What pisses me off most is that my friend tells me that the guy bought the
thing in very good running condition. With all the body work he could just
as well have started with a POS.

Later
