Normally, I stay as far away from conflicts as I possibly can, just part of my &quot;avoider&quot; personality.  However, I would like to make a comment regarding this thread from a COMPLETE OUTSIDER'S point of view.  I don't know NQ or Kevin, so there is absolutely nothing personal underlying here.  I can't understand why anyone would take issue with NQ's posting of ads which he does not intend on using FOR himself.  In the past five years, I have looked for and purchased 4 air-cooled VW's and Dammit, sometimes they are HARD to find.  So why wouldn't I want any help I can get in finding what I want, and anyone who helps me find it deserves a big &quot;Thank You&quot; for their help.  To me, this is not heaping loads of glory on someone, it's just common courtesy.  You help me, I'm gonna thank you and tell others that you helped me out.  And you would be deserving of it!  NQ, there is absolutely nothing wrong with wanting to know if you helped someone out, Hell, we all want to know if we make a d!
!
ifference.  This is not glory seeking, again just common courtesy.  So is the issue really that some folks may take offense at being offered someone elses' &quot;leftovers&quot;?  Sloppy Seconds??  Well, I'll tell it like it is:  It is 1,000 times better to get someones' &quot;sloppy seconds&quot; than to be standing in the corner by yourself j*rking off!!  Admin, I realize this is probably inappropriate and I wouldn't blame you a bit if you censored me.  But, as Walter Cronkite used to say &quot;That's the way it is!&quot;  And by the way, NQ, if you come across an early 60's Kombi or a 56 rag top split bug in the midwest that you don't want to buy, WOULD YOU MIND SENDING IT MY WAY?!?!?!?!?!
