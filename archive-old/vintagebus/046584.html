Subject: TX Listees: Anyone going to the show in Belton?
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

How's everyone?
Man it's good to be back on the list....anyways, just wondering if any TX 
listees are heading down to the Volkslennium 2000 show in Belton sunday?
If so drop me a line and let's get together...I need to meet some bus people, 
cause I sure do miss seeing buses on the road like out West....them bad boys 
are pretty scarce around these parts.

Beto
on the prowl for a new project (hint hint- any you Dallas guys got any leads?)
