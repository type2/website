It's supposed to go to the air cleaner, so that any
oil vapors would be sucked down the intake and burned.  
Some people just run a tube down thru the tin to 
run the oil mist past the engine.  Whatever you do,
don't cap it off!

&gt; I'm going to be honest with you, I have only seen 3 or 4 vintage bus engines up close and personal, and one of those is mine.  While looking through some gallery photos on Everett's site, I see that many buses have a hose connected to that tube thingy that comes up right next to the oil filler tube, my 66 has no hose connected here.  I have always assumed this just to be a crankcase breather (i have noticed a little oil residue beneath the opening)  In these photos it looks like the hose comes up into the bottom of the air filter\top of the carburator.  But I only see a hose connected here in about HALF of the photos.  Please enlighten me, was this hose on all engines, do I need this hose connected for performance issues, or is it just an emissions thing taht really serves no practical purpose???
