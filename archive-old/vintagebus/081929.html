Subject: More on door parts

As i search for the door parts i need a question comes
to mind.

Is there any reason that i can not use a passenger
side door gut assembly (pre 64) on the drivers side? 
That would allow me to lock the drivers door from the
inside as well as the outside.  I realize that it
would have to be installed upside down but will it
work???

Thanks
