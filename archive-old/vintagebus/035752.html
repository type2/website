&lt;&lt; well..
 when removing the seat belts the bolts were so frozen to the insert (all 4) 
that the insertss came out. i was told that this part is avail but when i 
looked through the parts book it shows the seat belts as an sp set but didnt 
show a part number for the treaded insert. i am assuming that this part is 
the same for many vws not just busses.   suggestions?  &gt;&gt;
Hi Andy,
Okay, we have been there before.  First apply a penetrating oil to the frozen 
threads for a week or two.  Then if you have a vise you can try to clamp onto 
the top, and bottom of the solid insert, and wrench free the bolts that hold 
the belts to them.  More likely than not even if you have a vise you will not 
get things apart.
    We have found that a large pair of Vise-Grips clamped onto the threaded 
sides of the inserts does the job.  Then once things are apart you can 
triangle file the damaged threads to usable shape.
If all fails you can try the VW parts shops for these inserts new!  We have 
seen them sold for all types of VWs with the new repro belts.
