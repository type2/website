&lt;&lt; all I can say is wow, if you can find an April issue of Total VW's from

England get it or at least look at it,. There is one of the most original

and beautiful 1963 Westy flip tops I have ever seen in that issue. It has

bullet front turn signals and the larger rear lights, it looks as though

it's a flip seat but hard to tell, no good photo's or mention in the text.

The seats still had plastic on them from Westy when the new owner bought it

and it is original paint, this is an unbelivable bus and warrant's takeing a

look at.
