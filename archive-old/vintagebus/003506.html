Just a quick note to let you all know that I made it home okay and Rob and
Justin are heading home right now.  The SC ran great the whole trip.  We
spent the night in North Platte, NE last night and junkyarded on the way
home today.  Found a complete oval window beetle and some popout glass in a
midwestern junkyard.  Met one splitty bus on the road on the way home.
Chased the guy down and he was enroute from New York to California.  He got
nervous and hopped in his bus and took off.  Oh well.

What a heck of a trip.  More later - I got pix to upload and mail to read.
