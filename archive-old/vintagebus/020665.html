Subject: 15&quot; by 23&quot; Color Wiring Diagram 

Hi List   Oh the joy of a huge color wiring diagram
lifted for free from the internet,Makes life worth
living.It's not what you know ...But who you know! I
dont have a printer so I ask a friend if she could
print it out for me.She gave me this color 15 by 23
inch or so print on clean white paper.I can see all
those little details very cool.                       
   Work on Ol'No Name is moving forward.Got the engine
out and have started cleaning off all the gear oil in
the engine compartment and else where from the torn CV
boot.Removed the burnt wiring from the tail light/back
up lights from that last fire.The battery tray area
might make it... This baby is a driver so I am not
going to over clean that is for sure.Hopes are when I
get a new/used engine in there she gets me down the
road and looks &quot;ok&quot; from the curb as I go by at
speed.Someday will come that full resto and I will
park it next to my cabin on my wooded property in the
northern Calif mountains...All I need is the
resto._dot_cabin..and wooded property !!!
