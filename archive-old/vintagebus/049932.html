Subject: Re: [VB] More questions

&gt;Yes I think I will keep the 6 volt as there are no problems.  How does
&gt;one know the mileage on a bus.

Educated guesswork.


  When I got my bus it had 40 thousand
&gt;miles.  What is this actually?

40,000 OR 140,000 OR 240,000 OR...

Or someone changed the speedo at some point and you'll never know.  There
is a production date (mo/yr) stamped on the back of the speedo.  If that
doesn't match the year of your bus (especially if it's newer), it's
probably been changed.



  The bus had tires on it that said made in
&gt;germany...

Continental?  Fulda?  Phoenix?



  Also what is the dime sized red light for  on the dash next
&gt;to the wiper switch?

The emergency flasher indicator.
