Subject: Re: [VB] re:upper engine bolt

This works for me, then again I have long gangly arms....your arms may
vary 

This is for the case with the insert:

Lay under the bus with feet pointing out the back.  Take the bolt and
any washers and start it by hand.  I then use a bunch of long and short
extensions and universal joints to accomplish the 2'+ reach to allow me
to use a ratchet down below all the chaos in the clear.  If you do it
just right you don't have too many sharp angles and none of the joints
bind.  Seems to work for me and since I'm a bit on the thin side I don't
even have to jack up the bus.  Of course my mild case of claustrophobia
does kick in every now and then.
