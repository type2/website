Subject: Re: [VB] Strange electrical problem

I still need to check it out, but I am thinking that there are 2 electrical
paths to the ignition system due to a miss wiring. Just need to chase it down.
Thanks for the info.

BTW The engine runs fine with the headlights on or off and the brakes on or
off as long as the ignition switch is on.

The new harness was installed by an &quot;expert restoration shop&quot;, to remain
nameless here, though I have mentioned the name before.

Chris

  normally the hot wire from the fuse box comes up to the 30 terminal on the
headlight switch, then jumps to the ig switch to give power to the ig switch.
If it comes off the ig switch at a different terminal, you would have to turn
the headlights on.

  Off hand I don't know what up with the brakes.. sound like it only runs when
the brakes are on?   that must be hard to drive... some thing is hooked up
wrong...   Coloured wiring diagrams at vintagebus_dot_com... do you have one
printed out?
