&gt; 
&gt;  O.K., so the windows are out of my 21 window.  What I need to know is,
&gt;  which company to go with when I buy the door and window seals.  Is there
&gt;  a company that has a reputation of good rubber products?  Also, who
&gt;  makes the best safari windows?
&gt;  
I prefer Wolfsberg West's seals -  softer squishier rubber than WCM.   They
are professional on the phone, and send stuff out ASAP.  

BUT- you must have a smooth sealing surface or the windows will still leak.
This means getting rid of any and all rust, patching and welding if
neccessary, primer, body putty to fill any rust dimples, and paint.   A smooth
surface.  Bare rust isn't smooth.   The 59 truck I am working on has new seals
and new glass over windsheild areas that were not fixed.  So I'll get to redo
them, lucky me.   And I like using roofing tar, maybe mixed with oil to the
right consistancy, between the seal and body and even between the seal and
glass on the bottom and bottom corners.  Help prevent bubbles and mist.
Takes more time to do it right, but the results are worth it.  

Safaris?   Volkwagen of course make sthe best ones, or did.  I hear Izzy's are
good, but do not personnally know.   I do not recommend safaris if you dislike
rain dripping in your left shoes or if you like to keep things on the package
tray.  If you live in a damp climate, you are nuts.  They are only appropriate
in desert like (dry) climates, otherwise they are a PITA, and cause rust holes
like swiss cheese in the front floor.  They leaked when new, AAMOF, though not
as much as the repros do.
