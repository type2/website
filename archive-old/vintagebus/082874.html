&gt;Craig,
&gt;	I forgot to mention that I was turning both camshafts without

ah - nevermind :)

&gt;   The german dished cam jumped solely from its contact with the oil 
&gt;pump gear.  So, I wonder what that is all about?

good question! maybe the slot in the cam gear face is a different 
profile, making the tab on the pump gear not seat right...

&gt;  The next question would go to what Craig mentions, does anyone sell 
&gt;&quot;adjust-a-gear&quot; dish style cam gears?  That would help with the -/+ 
&gt;fun!


sadly, no... since each case can be bored at the factory just a 
teensy bit different from side to side, the cam gears came in a range 
of profiles to compensate for the slop or tightness at the cam/crank 
interface. i forget whether the teeth have a different angle on their 
face, or the pitch of the gear (from perpendicular to gear face) is 
what changed - i think the hoover sermons explained it somewhere. 
but it means the variation is cast-in at the gear factory; no way to 
alter it.
