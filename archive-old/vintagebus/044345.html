Subject: '60 Standard is gone...

Chris Le Fon of Ft. Worth just left my house here in San Angelo with 
that '60 original safari window standard that I had bought a while 
back. This bus is original paint, minor body damage, 99% cancer free. 
Main problem with it is that the people who owned it before me used 
it for parts. So it's missing a lot...including safari window frames 
and glass.

I did my best to fill in all the missing holes, but he still will 
need a high hinge front cargo door and a few other tidbits. I'm sure 
once he gets it home he'll post what he's gonna need for it. I'm real 
glad he bought it and will be putting it back on the road. He's got 
his work cut out for him looking for parts, but bodywork is minimal.

He's towing it all the way using one of Dr. Joe's towbars. That's a 
long way on 4 wheels. Let's all keep good thoughts for him to make 
sure he has a safe drive home.

Nice to meet you chris! See Ya in Ennis!
