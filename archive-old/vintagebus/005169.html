Seems almost all the air cooled - modified engines I see use the .009
distributor.  Buggy House in Santa Clara, California seems to hate (based on
the flat spot problem) the .009 and love the .50.  I found in an old VW rag
(Hot VW) a two page write-up on many distributors available to the air
cooled engine.

Of the two pages, I think only one line were given to the .50.  Something
like:  The 0.50 is great for short rods. Does anyone else use or know about
the 0.50 distributor?
