&gt;&gt;There is a painting process that can paint the whole side of a vehical off of a photo, I saw this also at the SEMA show...  
&gt;&gt;
I wondered how they did that!  I'll have to call up McDonalds, maybe I can borrow it.

&gt;&gt;Do the graphics in vinyl, and seam them together like a billboard.  As far as the tatoos........youll look like the puzzle guy in all the tatoo magazines.
&gt;&gt;
I think vinyl graphics would be cost-prohibitive, not to mention it would suck to remove.

Are tattoo magazines a step up from porn?

Bus content:
I need a set of 1/3 2/3 middle seat springs from a pre-62 seat, these are ones that form the back rest and fold-down portion.  I'll even buy a rusty/crappy entire middle seat, as long as the backrests are good.
