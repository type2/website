Matt,

I guess I just developed the technique. Also, my 67 doesn't use the nylon
bushing under the shifter thingee, so I just need to get the sprung pin
thru the slot, then jam down on the shifter, and insert a bolt loosely. I
then just slide the whole mess over a bit to access the other bolt, which
is holding the rest together, and undo it. I guess I got this procedure
down out of bare necessity, as I do all my bus work alone.

&gt; Safety wire cut.  Penetrating oil applied.  :time passes:  OK,

Sound like you had quite a production here! ;-)  BE SURE to use anti-sieze
grease (Permatex/Loctite silver stuff in jar - NAPA Auto Parts, etc) all
over your coupling, end of rod, screw threads, so when you have to do the
repairs in 20 years, it will come apart easily.

&gt; I did discover that Craftsman flat ratcheting
&gt; wrenches don't work very well at all after you get p!ssed and throw
&gt; them at the driveway.

Did you know that the Craftsman flat 17/19mm ratcheting wrench (using the
17mm side) makes getting those two top-of-engine mounting bolts off and on
a real cinch when you're taking out/installing your engine? You learn to
feel the location of the nut by feeling thru the wrench, then slip it over
the nut, and it's off - same when installing. Start the nuts by hand til
tight, then get the ratcheting flat wrench back there and presto! You're
done. Just get them hand tight back there.

Anyways, end of rant!
