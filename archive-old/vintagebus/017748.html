 As soon as I
&gt; pull into my driveway
&gt; &gt; and see my bus I smile. 

You must have a painted bus that runs.


Actually, as much of a booger as DARTHVW looks, I
still peek out my kitchen window at him every time I
go to the sink. And on weekends, I open a cargo door,
ease onto the bare coil springs of the rusting middle
seat, peer up at the sky through the bent stringers of
the sunroof frame and imagine cruising down PCH at 40
MPH.

One day....
