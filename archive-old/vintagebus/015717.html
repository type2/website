Subject: 68 beam into 67

Hey all,
I have a 68 beam that I want to install in my 67 with 260,000 original miles 
on it's front end.
I need the straight dope on how much higher the bus will sit in the front 
end from someone who has done the conversion.
Did you offset it with larger tires in the rear?
I've heard that the front sits 1,2,3 inches higher? How high is it really? 
Thanks, Sam
