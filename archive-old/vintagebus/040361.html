Mike -

Could that be for the backside of a stripped out stud
on the oil strainer?  The one that got away while 
trying to get a nut on the backside?  It's really, really
easy to lose one, and very, very hard to find if it gets loose.

&gt;Neither the nut nor the washer is chewed up at all.  They were found
&gt;lying just forward of the strainer in the bottom of the case.
&gt;
&gt;I'm relatively certain it wasn't laying around loose in there when I
&gt;assembled everything and I can't imagine how it could have gotten into
&gt;the engine from the outside since then.
&gt;
&gt;Anybody got any ideas?
