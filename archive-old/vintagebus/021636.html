 Great! We all learn something. This is the reason for
 discussions. =) BTW: My xeroxed copy of the manual
 doesnt have pg 10-6 but skips to 11-1 (whatever).
 Pittman arm R&amp;R is on 10-4 on mine. Weird seems like
 we are a page off. Didnt intend a p*ssing contest but
 thought it weird that I had remembered seeing one on
 the barncamper. Then again I *am* within striking
 distance of Eddie VanHalen's age. Hahahahah!

I would still like to see pics of an install cause I wouldnt mind putting one 
on my 53.  Didn't think it was a Pissing Contest, thought the bible might 
tell me more than I knew.  who's got the steering damper installation  
bulliten?    put it up on a website.  search for the lost scroll.
