Raise it to stock height? :)

I'd found a '58 walk-thru standard FS a couple years
go.  It was actually in decent shape, not much rust, 
fairly straight.  But some bonehead lowered it real
kewel-like, to the ground.  He was probably the kewelest
kid in the high school parking lot until he had to remove
the rear wheels.  He ended up bowing out the rear wheel
arches - badly - in order to get the wheels off and on.
