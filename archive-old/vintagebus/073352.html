Subject: Voltage regulator hook up

Hey Y'all,
I have a 67 that I am putting an engine into. I bought
a new voltage regulator (for 67-68 bus) but there is
only one terminal on the VR which is labelled. The
labelled says &quot;D+&quot;, but the othe 3 terminals have no
labels. There is a small push on term on the same end
as the D+. Then on the other end there is a bigger 2
prong push on terminal and a smaller single one.
Can anyone tell which is what and which goes where?
