The difference between that and the &quot;new bus&quot; is the new bus doesn't appear to be offering anything new under the sun technology wise, but rather is a purely stylistic and marketing ploy.  Same goes for the New Beetle; 
-------------------

Very true, but you didn’t mention the years of enthusiast whining about &quot;bringing back the bug&quot; ie: Terry Shuler, and many others.  For years people whined about the fact that VW wasn't importing the Mexi-bug.

----------------
The new beetle is one of the few concept cars which didn't change much between the auto show and production, but it did lose a few cool feature on the way (like the androgonyous fenders)
--------------------------------------

Well, yes but what about cars like the new Ford Thunderbird? That car is extremely close to what the show car looked like.  Same thing with the Audi TT.  It seems with CAD/CAM, car companies seem to be able to make cars very close to their concept...if they want too.  That said, I'm sure people will help them change their minds about what the final design of the &quot;bus&quot;.
