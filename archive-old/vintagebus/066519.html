Subject: re:6volt starter life span

i have not done the switch over, i am still 6 volt. but i am pretty sure
that basically everything will fry in your system eventually-although i have
heard that the starters will last for quite a while-i think all your bulbs
would burn out very quickly, the wiper motor will fry pretty quickly-there
was discussion about something to adjust voltage to the wiper motor-but
there were problems with doing that-which i can not remember.
