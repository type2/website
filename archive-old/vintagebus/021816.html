I assume you're referring to the diamond shaped extension plate.  I
put one in my 67 bug and used it for twelve years until I put it in
my 71 bus and used it until I sold the bus in 1985.  It worked great.
I would put one in the 71 Bus I have now except the original owner
installed a Gene Berg shifter.

&gt;Hi list,
&gt;
&gt;     Has anyone here ever put a quickshift in their bus or beetle?  
&gt;How 
&gt;should I do it?  I ordered one from JC Whitney, but no instructions. 
&gt; I 
&gt;should be able to figure it out, but I wanted to know if anyone has 
&gt;ever 
&gt;done it.  It would be going in a '65 beetle with a 67 and up shift 
&gt;lever 
&gt;(with out the little rod to keep the letter from spinning in the 
&gt;socket)
&gt;
&gt;Thanks,
&gt;Matt
&gt;
&gt;
