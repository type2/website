You know this thread has got me thinking,
I'm gonna put some scoops on my 64, plus maybe I'll run some ducting up and 
mount one of those huge V-8 blower scoops on the roof.
Then I'll fabricate a custom exhaust with lake pipes coming out the side of 
the bus...hmm...could double as side steps

....It's gotta be friday somewhere... I hope..LOL
