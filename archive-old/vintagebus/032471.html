The front pieces are different as well.
Make sure you notch the bottom of the felt for the tract to slide into 
correctly.

Alright, well I need your help, once again.

In efforts to try and keep the '59 Westfalia as original/stock as
possible, I'm keeping the older front slider glass with the latch mounted
to the track for the glass.  As everyone probably knows, none of the
major parts houses reproduce this style.  My originals consisted of about
30% of what was supposed to be there.  I just received my new felt kits,
well 2, yesterday.  My intent was to try and carve up two sets making one
with the proper dimensions.  I just got finished with trying a 1&quot; sample.
 The drill, to delicately peel back the bulk of the felt, trim rubber
like a surgeon, glue together and reapply the felt.  It can be done, but
not only does one have to make basic cuts like completely removing one of
the rubber vertical divider pieces, but also trim the same dividers
vertically to thin them out, as know you have to create 2 dividers as
opposed to one, in the same width of space. !!

I've decided to best course of action is to try and locate a decent set
of original lower felt channels.  I only need the LOWERS, so don't worry
about having a complete window's worth.  I could care less if all of the
original felt is missing.  What is important is that the rubber is sound.
 But even if your's aren't great, email me anyway as it would probably be
easier to splice a few originals together than new ones.  I'm desperate,
I'll take anything!!!!

I would really appreciate anyone digging around and see if you have one,
or a pair that you wouldn't might seeing go into the Westy.  I'm trying
to stay on track for the maiden voyage to the Summer OCTO meet, and
playing Marcus Welby on felt channels is not what I need to be doing. 
Please, I don't want to hear that I should just mellow out and put in
later slider glass.  I realize I'm screwed up, I don't need to be
reminded. :)~

Thanks in advance for any help.
