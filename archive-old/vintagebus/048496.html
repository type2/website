&gt;&gt;Sounds like you'd better move out on a farm to store all these buss'
&gt;&gt; your finding.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; &quot; No Quarters Bus Farm &quot; Restored buss' and parts, at reasonable
&gt;&gt; prices!!

&gt;My very patient and VW tolerant wife and I are closing on an old farmhouse
&gt;with a 30' x 31' attached barn on 4 acres the end of this week...


Be VERY careful guy's.  At first my ex-wife was very tolerant of my busses.
But as I kept building barns (3 - 30x50) and adding busses (up to over 40)
she decided the bus farm wife was not what she wanted to be known for.

So now she is living her up-scale life (in her mind anyway) and left the
120 acres of trees, hills, streams and great fishing ponds (not to mention
all the cool busses) to our daughter and me.

Gee I wonder who got the better of that deal!!
