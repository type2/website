The spare tire location changed from the cab to hanging from under the bed
when the change to the adjustable seat was made.

&gt; I just got back from picking up my &quot;new&quot; Euro Single Cab. Aside from
&gt; alot of surface rust this thing is nice and solid. When sitting in the
&gt; &gt; The truck also has the spare tie mounted in a cradle under the bed
&gt; (pictures tomorrow) I've seen this twice before. Once in either Thom or
&gt; Everett's galleries and in the latest issue of Hot VW's. Is this a VW
&gt; option, and if so what is the m-code? I have must of them sorted out,
&gt; but I don't see this one.....
