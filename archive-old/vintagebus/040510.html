Hello there,

This is Regis Philbun, anybody out there have a nice VW bus they would like 
to sell me?  I like the ones with the little tiny windows on top and the big 
hole in the roof.  Do you guys know what I'm talking about?

Okay, I guess I could've waited for friday, but I couldn't resist.

Mike A.
