looking for any advice on setting up the bus for the journey. &gt;&gt;
Hi Dickey,
1.  Drain and refill with proper Wt oils the tranny, reduction boxes, 
engine/aircleaner, and steering boxes.  Look for any metal shaving larger 
than a pin head and the more of these the worse off that component probably 
is.
2.  Replace all the flexable fuel lines and make sure the metal fuel line 
where it goes through the forward engine tin either has it's hard rubber 
grommet in place or use a 2&quot; section of slit lengthwise and hose clamped 
around the metal fuel line protecting it from the tin from sawing it through.
3.  Buy the Bentley reprint of the VW bus shop manual.  Yes it is expensive, 
but worth every penny.
4.  Start collecting spare parts for you bus to carry on the trip, and save 
up at least $600.00 just for emergency $$.
5.  Tach your engine MPH _at_ engine RPMs in each of the forward gears to see 
where they are. You can not hear the RPMs in the bus like you can in the type 
1s especially in third and fourth gears.
