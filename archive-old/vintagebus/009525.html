This is a trip report that will eventually be posted to the buskatiers
website.  There will be pictures up but as of this writing, the mention of
them in this article is a bit premature so please ignore those references.
This happened on March 17th, 2001.  Thought you would enjoy reading this.
================================================================
Buskatier's Fun Day at Rick Taylor's bus farm.

(3-17/3-18-01)It had been a mere 4 weeks since we had been down in the
Kansas City area for the wonderful heater seminar that Rick, Pink, and the
KC Kombis had put on. I had told Rick at that time that I was interested in
his lone double-cab and would like to skit down there at the next possible
opportunity to check it out. I had planned for 3 weeks from that date and
the weather dictated that it be 4. As it worked out, Rob and Justin and our
bus-wannabe friend Kevin wanted to go along and I was more than pleased to
have them along as I travel alone in my bus most of the time when I go
places.

Friday turned out to be a rather nice day and after work I immediately took
care of things like getting gas, oil, supplies, and heading to the car wash.
When I arrived home at 7:15, the gang was already here. I didn't plan on
them showing up until 8:00 or after so it was a nice surprise to see that
they had beat me home. It necessitated that I step up the pace a little bit
and get things packed so we could head out. Within an hour we were packed
and I'm sure the guys appreciated the work I had done the day before on the
seatcover on the rear seat. The vinyl is so dry and brittle it's flaking
off and looking like a mouse nest. At least now I don't have to look at it!
:-)

As we left, Rob made the comment that he hadn't eaten and as a matter of
fact, nobody had. We ended up at Burger King - putting down some of their
delicacies and by 9:00 we were on the road, heading south on U.S. 77. Road
construction which commenced March 8th made us take a detour on rough gravel
roads but once we hit the highway, everything was kosher. Just outside of
Marysville, we heard a sound on the roof and come to find out, one of the
chains from the towbar had come loose and danced a jig in the wind up there.
We had just been chatting about the guy who was killed and whose body had
been carted off in my bus about 16 years ago so immediately we thought that

maybe he was knocking on the roof! :-) The towbar and the potato cannon
were still securely fastened to the roof so we were &quot;all systems go.&quot; We
avoided the trains that go through Marysville every 15 to 20 minutes and
kept on going east on U.S. 36 until we came to the little town of Seneca.
Bladders and munchies had us stopping so I gave Rick a call on the cell
phone. It was 10:00 by now and Rick said we were still 2 hours out. We
proceeded on to Fairview. That is where we picked up highway 75 and headed
south. We passed the Sac &amp; Fox casino on the reservation and I had to think
about how similar this was to the trip I took from Havasu to Vegas in the
early morning hours back in January amidst casinos. Gas here was $1.21 a
gallon but we didn't stop as we had enough to take us all the way to
suburban Topeka.

I had warned the guys that the bus does get cold even with temps as high as
in the 60's because the induced wind chill robbing heat from the bus via
leaky seals and raw cooling power can be a force to be reckoned with. Rob
and Justin kind of curled up in the back seat under a sleeping bag and
managed to sleep off the trip down there hit or miss. Kevin was up front
with me and since he can sing and carry a tune rather well, we sang a lot
and even did harmonies. I enjoy someone who can sing good enough to do
2-part-harmonies - it's a rare treat for me!

With Kevin as my right hand man/navigator, we managed to get to Rick's
about midnight with only one short wrong turn. At night, it seems to take
forever when you know you are getting close to your destination and counting
off road signs and so forth but in due time, we made it to Rick's. We
avoided the washouts at the beginning of his driveway and assumed our
position in the car port. Pigpen (our Buskatier friend from KC) was already
there chilling out and despite the coziness of the wood stove inside, both
of them came out to great us. I was impressed with Rick's house from the
get-go and it was as cozy and as conducive to company as could be the entire
time we were there.

Of course since we arrived right at midnight, everyone was still a little
tired but we milked out the evening into Saturday morning until 2:00 to
2:30. I played my trademark song, &quot;I've Been Everywhere&quot; for the gang right
after I restrung my guitar. Before long though, the sandman was making his
rounds so Kevin took the upstairs bedroom, Pig Pen and I shared a room with
our sleeping bags placed upon Westphalia cushions (yeah man!), and Rob and
Justin did the same in the adjacent room. Due to Rick's current renovations
project, we were able to visit freely between the open wall and laugh
ourselves to sleep with idle chat and delirious laughter.

I slept like a log.

True to form, I was either the last one up or darn close to it. Rick had
the &quot;Taylor Breakfast Burrito&quot; concoction well underway and I awoke to it's
beautiful aroma. I twilighted for a while, drifting in and out of
consciousness and finally whipped myself into submission and high-tailed it
into the bathroom. Once I was back to &quot;borderline presentable&quot; I got my
gear gathered up and ventured out into the living room to see if anyone
could beat my scarecrow hairdo. By this time, fellow Buskatier Keith Petite
from Junction City, KS had arrived as well as Bryant Baecht from Lawrence,
KS. We had a total of 8 Buskatiers sitting at the breakfast table. If you
went away from that table hungry, it was absolutely your own fault. We had
a sausage, egg, cheese, and potato casserole with homemade mini-cinnamon
rolls. What a chef that Rick Taylor is!

We talked about everything under the sun and before long, we all kind of
excused ourselves and meandered around the premises. I jammed a little bit
on the guitar and then before long I had the wonderful surprise of meeting
Rick's dad! He's 77 years young and has as much pep and spunk as you could
ever imagine. I'm sorry that I forgot his name but he's done extensive
research on an aviation pioneer from the early days in Kansas. Forget about
Cessna, Piper, etc. This guy built a composite aircraft that flew back in
1923!!! For $10, you could buy the book that details all the research that
has been compiled - things such as crash sites, buildings that were once
airplane factories, and misprints in newspapers - stuff any aviation history
buff couldn't help but be intrigued by. It's a great little history book
and I'm glad I was able to buy a copy. Rick's dad is quite the historian!

Soon after his departure, we headed out of the famed row of busses that
Rick has collected over the years. As it turns out, despite his selling
them off in recent years, he's got quite the stash. The less desirables
are kept outside in a row (splitties and bays with a few scattered bugs and
rails) and the better stuff is kept in several machine sheds. I don't know
if anybody counted how many VWs there were but I saw plenty. There was a
Thing, nice Double Cab, and a splittie poptop Westy that were worthy of
mention - pretty straight and in great shape.

It wasn't long after our tour of the facilities that Rick fired up the four
wheeler ATV and let us all take turns buzzing around the pasture with it.
The land Rick lives on used to be a little park/resort years ago where you
could go, rent a rowboat, and enjoy scenic life out on the pond. A rowboat
and one outhouse still stands where this spring- fed pond sits now and
rumor has it that trophy bass haunts its waters. Soon after ATV riding
commenced, Rick got a little shop-teacher-twinkle in his eye and after his
suggestion to set up the bus lifter and our resulatant and persistent
prodding, he decided to set it up!!!

This is a gizmo Rick made that uses 2 manual boat winches, steel
trusses, pullies, cables, etc. to literally winch a bus into the air out of
the ground high enough that you can back a car trailer underneath and lower
it down onto it. You no longer need good tires on your project bus in order
to pull it from that field. Just winch it up and set her down and that's
just what we did. For pure fun and photographic moments, we lifted a bus in
the air and set it back down. What a bunch of fun that was! The kicker is
that this lift is totally collapsible and can be dismantled for easy
storage. Awesome!

All the while that we were winching up the bus, we took turns riding the 4
wheeler. The weather was great and the VW high that we all felt was
tremendous! Shortly after all of this, it was time to put all the toys away
as Rick wanted to get dinner started.

The guys gathered in little groups here and there talking about what not
while we were waiting for Rick to get dinner put on the table. I set the
table for Rick while he was busy cooking up homemade beef stew, jalapeno
cheese cornbread, and a double fudge cake. Not bad for a bunch of guys
having a get together huh? Rick's ex-wife definitely taught him well. :-)
:-) Bryant's bus which he picked up from somewhere out in Colorado (due to
my VW ads) was running rich so a few guys gathered behind his bus to see if
they could adjust it out of the carb. As for myself and eventually the rest
of the crew, we fired off my potato cannon. I figured it would make for a
great past time and sure enough, in no time, we had shot off half a bag of
potatoes. Much to everyone's humor, we were putting them in the middle of
Rick's pond and even a couple made it over to the far bank. Rob was my
cannon-man. He would load the tater down the 10 foot long barrel with some
scrap chainlink toprail we found in the garage and I would charge it up with
a little starting fluid afterwards. With a muffled bang it would bring
laughter and smiles to us all. The fun was over once my igniter broke but
it was a great past time. Kevin and Keith went down and fired the little
.22 pistol down by the dam so all in all, we just had a great time doing guy
things in the country. Rick's got a wonderful place out there around
Berryton, KS and I'm sure hoping that eventually we'll have an annual
Buskatiers event at his place. It's a _GREAT_ place to hold a bus event.

In due time, Rick was ready to commence with the dinner proceedings so we
sat down at and ate. I don't know about the rest of the Buskatiers but I
really ATE. I even ate up my bag of puffcorn I brought along. Yeah, I was
a glutton but I was indulging in the moment. I knew that once this was over
it would be time to move on.

Just before we all left Rick's, he had received a call from some guy
wanting to know about a rumored double cab for sale. This really was the
whole reason for my trip - to scope out a 1962 double cab that Rick had for
sale. I felt like I really should make a decision so I made big down
payment for half of what Rick wanted for the bus. It's a project but it's
100% complete. Everything is there and the front end is nice and tight.
It's got rust but I'm looking for a project that I can tear into and do body
work on without feeling scared that I might screw it up. So I'm almost the
proud owner of a 1962 double cab. Thanks Rick! Rob also found out that
Rick had a nice old Apache camper for sale and so Rob bought it. It will
tow very nice behind the SC once Rob gets a hitch mounted on it. That will
make for one nice little package for Rob when he heads to events. Kevin
bought a 1960 Panel that Rick had. It's rusty too but Kevin is thrilled to
have his first bus. Hopefully he'll be joining us soon as the Buskatier
events in his very own bus! :-)

It soon was way past time for us to head out so with Rick in the lead and
the rest of us bus goslings waddling behind, we all pulled out and
caravanned to Shawnee Mission middle school where Rick teaches. He took us
all inside and showed us his shop. Never have I seen such an awesome votech
shop. The kids who attend this school are very lucky. I saw CO2 powered
cars, model rockets, video lab, VW generator hooked to an exercise bike to
produce power to run a 12v TV, wind tunnel, and just oodles of neat stuff
that I wished I had had access to when I was in school. After being out of
school now for almost 11 years, it was kind of nice to be back with some
&quot;older&quot; students. :-)

After this we headed to the Topeka Sam's club where we commenced to loading
up a cart or 2 of goodies to take advantage of Rick's membership. The very
propane Black Cat heater that I paid $50 for at the local Kmart could be had
with an igniter for $19.99. Mine didn't even have an igniter with it. I
also had forgotten my bedding so I bought a sleeping bag to use that night
at my friend Wendy's apartment in Kansas City. We all left with some kind
of a good deal there. Before long, we really needed to head out. Keith
needed to head home so we bid him farewell and the rest of us (Bryant, Rick,
and us 4 guys) headed to the gas station. We got a compliment on my bus
from a passerby while we were there so that was a nice touch. We shot the
breeze over pumping gas nozzles and once again, it was time to hit the road.
We left Bryant behind as he needed to head back to Lawrence but we left with
some agreements concerning the up and coming Buskatiers list and with chat
about starting an actual Buskatiers site.

We ended up on a toll road into KCMO. Rick lead the way and somewhere along
the line Rob realized he had forgotten his video tape of the heater seminar.
We managed to flag Rick down and after a quickie rendezvous at an exit, we
were soon trodding along towards KCMO. Finally our fearless leader Rick had
to exit as he was enroute to the machine shed where his gas heater stuff was
still sitting from a month prior in order to pick it up. Horn honks,
smiles, and waving hands concluded our interaction with Rick and we went our
separate ways, dissolving into the abundant yuppie traffic.

Toward KCMO, we bumped into Pigpen again. We thought we had lost him but
somehow he got beside us again on the highway and so we were also able to
part ways with smiles, waves, and all that good Buskatiers stuff. :-)

That pretty much concluded the Buskatiers weekend at Rick Taylor's bus
farm. What started out as a trip for me to scope a double cab turned into a
Buskatiers event which Rick tongue-in-cheek named, &quot;Buses by the Barn.&quot; As
it is with all VW events, it's overwith all too soon and before it even gets
started. You just never can get enough of this stuff! :-)
