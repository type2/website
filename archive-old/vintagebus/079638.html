Subject: Re: [T2] Why dwell would vary with RPM?

&gt; I pulled the dizzy and set the points exactly at .016. When

&gt; time I tried to fine tune the point gap with the dizzy installed. Again it

There are two possible causes for your wandering dwell.  The first and
simplest is that the spring that is supposed to sit between the
distributor and the distributor drive gear is missing.  The second is wear
on the bearings of the shaft.

The spring is necessary because as the engine RPMs increase the drive gear
tends to &quot;climb&quot; on its mate on the crankshaft.  If the distributor is
sitting on the gear then it will ride up as well.  This exposes the points
rubbing block to a different and possibly less worn portion of the lobes
of the cam at the top.  In order that this not happen Volkswagen installed
a spring between the drive and the distributor to pretension the
distributor at the top of its travel.  The cure is to remove the
distributor and look for the spring.  If it isn't there, insert one.

Worn shaft bearings can be detected by attemptinf to move the rotor
side-to-side while the distributor is out of the engine.  If it moves at
all, the bearings are shot. The cure for worm bearings is to rebuild the
distributor or to obtain a rebuild unit.

                             OOK!
