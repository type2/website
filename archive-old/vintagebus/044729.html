Hi JD,
Did your oil pressure switch have tapered threads?  Does the engine case 
appear to have had the same?  If so, then retap the threads. Make sure to 
pack the flutes of the tap with thick grease to catch as much of the metal 
chips and prevent these from getting to the bearings!  Then carefully install 
your tapered threaded sender.  Does the sender bottom out on the case?  If so 
you will need to file off enough case material to at least allow 1/16&quot; space 
between the sender body and the engine case.
