 Since the paint on the undercarriage of my '67 Westy is all but gone, does
 anyone know how it should be painted? Mine is not -and won't be-
 undercoated. Is it primer, black, or body color? My bus is a factory
 European delivery 2-tone. I'm going to blast it and repaint.
 
  &gt;&gt;
the underside of my 65 westy is primer, with some of the lower body colour
(velvet green).  When I had the tranny out the other week I sat in there with
a squirter of simple green and a old toothbrush and some rags, (this was very
effective) and cleaned away a bunch of that rust preventative slime layer left
by leaky trannys.  I wondered if this was cleaning off the green paint, as in
some areas there was more green, and in some areas it was only dusted on over
the primer.    Highly unlikely.  So I think it is mainly primered with some of
the lower body colour in places (overspray from the enigine compartment.
Where the spring plates attach there is lotso green, and in the engine
compartment, and right under it, but further under the body it is grey.   With
surface rust in places as that primer is over 30 years old.
