Follow-up...

I purchased the correct metric 8 x 1.25 tap at a hardware store.  Just the
single tap, then purchased a matching size cobalt drill bit.  All together,
under $9.  I removed the stud from another case and pretty much matched up
the metric size by eye.  It was right...

Like some said, drilling the type1 case is like drilling into butter.  It
was really easy to turn.  My only other experience drilling holes in metal
was attempts to remove broken exhaust studs... and hard steel doesn't drill
as easy :)

My new Brazilian AS 41 case __ DID __ have the boss for the thermostat stud,
so it was real simple to know where to locate it.  I pretty much just winged
it, as it isn't particularly easy to draw 3D lines.  The boss made a good
reference as to front/back alignment, and my drill did have a level in it...
but I ended up putting the case at 45 degrees to ground and just drilled.
I'd say I was about 8 out of 10 on location.  Slightly to one side of center
on the boss.

My biggest mistake was drilling the hole too deep.  I actually started to
penetrate the far side of the boss.  Oh well, not a huge mistake.

The stud from a German case fits perfect, and it appears to be in the
correct place.  Thanks all.

P.S.  Eagle hardware here in the PNW has a good selection of metric bits,
but their prices are really really really high.  The matching stud was $1.99
each, that just blows me away.  Even M8 nuts are like 50 cents.  Luckily
there is a VW FLAPS in area, Auto Sport Import near Seatac airport, that has
an awesome selection of bolts / nuts / studs.
