Subject: Radio repair
Message-ID: &lt;Pine.GSO.4.21.0007070900590.5524-100000_at_sandman.ucdavis_dot_edu&gt;

I recently had my Sapphire II radio repaired by a shop in Sacramento.  The
individual who did the repairs was very knowledgable and competent in old
radio repair.  If any of you out there would like the info go ahead and
e-mail me.  I had a hard time finding someone who would tackle
it.  Apparently the guy on the web (Brad's??) has retired.
