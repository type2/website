&lt;&lt; ok ..I think I have a problem,I have a 59 DD panel and just checked 
 the vin#'s on the title to the vin#'s on the body
 on the &quot;m&quot; code plate  vin matches the title as does the longer 
 plate in the engine comp.
 but the stamped number in the engine comp does not match!
 is this the vin # or a body number like a beetle????
 am I screwed???if so I may be parting this thing out!

they should match. at least they do on both my 59's. I would guess that the 
plates have been replaced(guess remeber). don't really see that its that big 
a problem. If you ever need to have the vehicle inspected by the dmv for what 
ever reason, just fill in or grind off the numbers that don't match. If it 
bothers you, get a number punch set and put a new one on. all better. doesn't 
seem like a reason to part out a bus that is otherwise fixable. would have 
been nice to know before you got the rig, would've made a good bargaining 
chip. If it makes you feel any better, my dormobile has 3 different vin's.
