&gt;He calls the bus a Kombi, but I have my doubts.

The easiest way to tell the difference between a Standard or Kombi is 
whether or not there is a heater tube under the rear seat in the cargo 
area.  Standards had them, Kombis did not.

Kombis could come two-toned, &amp; would have an SK before the paint code 
(as well as have the SK &amp; code in grease pencil inside the RH headlight 
bucket).
