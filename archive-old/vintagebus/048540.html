This thread about how your neighbors dislike your VW yard art is
interesting.  I personally live on a farm and bought the surrounding ground
so I wouldn't have any close neighbors.  I have three 30x50 barns that are
full of VW stuff, but have over flowed with around 30 busses that have to
sit outside.

The locals don't mind, I keep my stuff pretty neat, but I am afraid it cost
me my wife who left me in May, something about not wanting to live at
&quot;Sanford and Son&quot;.  I think she got a little too pricey in her tastes, she
is more of a Caddy person than a bus.

But I have coined a phrase that I use here at school for those students
that have problems following the school rules, and you can quote me on this
one:

&quot;The road of life is much smoother if you stay between the lines&quot;
