&lt;&lt; It is funny you should mention RMMW.  I brought up 
to OPP that if he wanted to  be successful in business 
he needed to change his approach.  He said he *was*
successful.  Told him Chris Nowak of RMMW going 
from a business operated out  of a garage to a huge 
national mail order mega-business in a few short years
was successful, OPP was not.  &gt;&gt;

Define successful. 

What does RMMW contribute to our hobby?  What have
they designed and manufactured to the betterment of 
our VWs?  They're just another in a long line of parts
resellers.  Remember Johnny's Speed and Chrome?
Small Car Specialties?  Same stuff- different package.
Anyone with enough money can take out ads in the
VW magazines (which can lead to 'coverage' of VW
events in their parking lot- more advertisement), put out 
a slick catalogue, and generally bombard the purchasing 
public into submission with their name.  Heck, they do 
it all the time in Washington, D.C.

OPP builds the one of the best Type IV fan shroud 
conversion kits around.  Hours of testing and research 
went into this design.  They didn't just grab some Chinese 
chrome stuff and slap it on a piece of cardboard with 
their name on it and make an earth shattering 
announcement about it.  Its like saying AutoCraft isn't 
successful,  Pauter isn't successful, Mendola Racing's 
isn't successful simply because they don't have the 
cheapest bolt on junk, the glossiest ads, or the 
slickest catalogs.   Long after that ill-fitting piece of 
repro offshore tin has rusted through, the quality 
products and their designers/manufacturers will still 
be here.  That is as long as we continue to support 
them in their efforts.  Otherwise, we run the risk of 
seeing the true support for our hobby simply saying 
&quot;You want junk?  You got it&quot;, throwing in the towel,
and walking away.  

What have you done today to ensure that those kinds 
of innovators will be around for the foreseeable future?   
Bolted on a knockoff Monza muffler because the real 
one was 'too' expensive?
