Subject: re:&quot;Slightly Custom&quot;

  Coachbuilt vs. Custom jobs facinate me.  Seems the difference is in
volume and marketing.  It seems this is excellent workmanship, at least
better than some of the Binz's coachbuilding problems I've heard about,
but I have to find out for myself if the mods compromised the stock set-up
unfavorably.
  
  I'm sure my 61' Sideloader was probably made and marketed againt the
Corvair Rampside (I'm still looking for info on this!), by a conversion
company who made a prototype.  According to dropgates_dot_com, the open bay
would cost *less* cause there is less materials.

  I *really* like this car and the think it is one of the top custom jobs
I have ever seen.  The price of this car has dropped more than the stock
market, and like the owner says to repo this yourself - it would cost
more.

  BUT, I just think it would be difficult to get a title change because it
would be considered a Reconstruction (great JG group) or canibal car here
in used jersey - what a nightmare that would be!, when I changed the title
on the sideloader, they told me the VW VIN was already taken by a moped! I
heard of a guy who bought a new mexican beetle and tried to get it
licensed and they confiscated his car.  And having no front blinkers would
be a safety issue.

Best,
joe
