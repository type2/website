Subject: cooling and charging in a 58 - help

I finally brought my '58 panel home today!  Woohoo!  However, there a
few key issues that I need to resolve before I can drive it to the vinyl
shop for some nice new logos.  Here is the history as far as I know it
of the bus.
 
A 1600 DP and non-stock tranny installed.  12V bulbs installed.  6V
wiper motor still in place (I will get the switch)
 
Here are my issues..
 
1)       being that it is a type I 1600, The rear tin is missing.  Can I
use the standard bug tin with the rear apron?  There seems to be some
tin missing underneath as well.  It has been some time since I have had
to deal with bug engines and I have forgot some things.  The two hoses
off the cooling shroud connect where?  The heater boxes?  
 
      2)  There is no voltage regulator.  The alternator is not hooked
up to anything but the battery (probably not good)   There is a large
red wire running from the B+ terminal of the alt. to the + terminal of
the battery.  There are also 3 push on stile connectors in front of the
B+ post on the alt.   Can anyone lend a hand in getting this thing
charging?  I know I need a VR, but which one?  What wires go where?  
 
 
This is just the beginning of the list.  Everything else is pretty
cosmetic, but I will post questions as I run into troubles.  Anyone know
where I can get a driver side mirror assembly?  How bout a rear view?
 
Thanks again
