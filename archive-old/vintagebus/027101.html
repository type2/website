Subject: Original glass

Wow, I never realized how worked up people can get.  I thought for a
minute I was reading a corvette clubs post!
    I personally am going to just have a new windshield cut and
installed. I tried using an original piece once, only to have it break
while trying to install it, (no I wasn't using a screwdriver.)
    Loosen up people, it's a VW, not a '31 Rolls Royce!
