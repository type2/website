&lt;&lt; I think 64 was the first year with an outward lip ,its the same up thru, 
 71and maybe 72 ,,you can get the panels from Wolfsburg west ,,and i noticed 
 today looking thru BFY's Catallog they list it also for the 64 thru 67 ,i 
 think WW was about 30.00 or there abouts ,,i have used it decent panel had 
to 
 modify it a bit ,,the BFY one might be a direct fit ,,but i don't know that 
 for sure ,,Later

the flared wheel well was introduced 30 july 62.  at chassis 971 550  doglegs 
also changed then

same time the bench seat went to 1/3, 2/3 and the spare tire recess was 
deepened

so if your wheel wells is cut you can look at the front seat and see which 
kind it came with.   If it had the divided cut out and bucket bolted in check 
the way the seats attached.   the drivers side rails should neithe r be 
screwed to the bus- that is for one year only walkthoughs with adjustable 
front seats pre the change of wheel wells.
