&gt;The only thing I remember for sure was the 28mm main venturi's.


28mm is on smallish side for duals on a 1776. Could cost you a few tenths in
the quarter mile, but shouldn't bug you too much around town. Would be just
dandy on a single one-barrel carb. Should be workable through the lower and
mid and start strangling at the upper end. If this is what it sounds like,
maybe a 30 or 32mm venturi would suit your application better, but those
rascals are around thirty bucks each, make a decision and pay for it. Easier
to drive with too small than too big, and if you're ballsy and careful, you
can make them bigger yourself. If you're going to upsize, do it first.
Jetting starts over with a new venturi. Webers' rough formula is for a main
jet that is the venturi size times four. A 112 is called for, but the
formula tends towards the lean side. The number is a starting point but I
would start nearer a 120, maybe a 115 and a set of jet drills. The formula
for the corresponding air correction jet would be main jet + 60 so say a
175ish. Again, these are where to start from if you have no clue as to what
you should run. If it idles good and stumbles when you crack the butterfly,
you're prolly rich in the lows (smelly with black smoke when you crack it)
or venturi is too big which will make it just fall on its' face (discounting
the 009, of course). If it idles and runs up good, but has no power at all,
too lean. If it idles good, good power and strangles at the high end,
venturi too small. I find it hard to believe that you are the first to
attempt this. Someone could save you a lot of trouble if they already have
the venturis and jetting all figured out, but if so, they are silent at this
point. It can be worked out, patience grasshopper. If you make a change and
it seems to work, you need to drive the vehicle for a while, it will change
when it gets to operating temp. for that setup. Think about what it is
telling you, then go back and make the change. The mixture adjustments
affects idle and low end, the main jets affect midrange and high end and the
air correction jet is pretty much high end only. Think of it like three
separate carbs. Each needs to be set up correctly. It won't be over in a
weekend unless you get real lucky or can get parts local.

&gt;I also think I'll take them to a carb shop and have the throttle shafts
&gt;re-bushed (34 ICT's weren't bushed originally, but I understand they can
&gt;be drilled and bushed by a good machine shop).  It's an almost certainty
&gt;that they're leaking air at the throttle shafts - maybe enough to
&gt;over-lean the mixture?  Maybe that in combination with poor jetting is
&gt;more likely.

I'm not familiar with these carbs, but I have always cut washers out of a
coffee can lid and slipped them up against the carb body on the shaft inside
all the little washers and doohickeys. A little bit of sticky grease to seal
it and then see if it makes an improvement. I'm not saying it will last, and
I'm not saying it won't, but it works good for testing.
