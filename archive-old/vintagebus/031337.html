Subject: Re: [VB] NEW HOT WHEELS BUS

I put in my order months ago... still waiting for it.  One of the 
corporate bigshots came through the shop a couple months ago and saw the 
pictures of my buses hanging on my tool box and said he'd get me some. 
I guess thats corporate BS for ya!  ...and I'm a freakin' employee!

Me? Bitter? Nahhhhhhhh...

Come redeem your oil change at the Oshkosh, WI location. :) The only VW 
I've touched there so far was a late 80s V'gon!  Talk about withdrawls...

store #4254

ps -- I thought I posted about this months ago?  Did they just become 
available to the public?

&gt; 
&gt; You get a free oil change coupon when you order also, so the deal is 1 free
&gt; bus with the purchase of an oil change,  and you can order up to 5 more at a
&gt; discount rate.
