Subject: Need help locating a stock looking Bus for a VW event 

Hello Vintage Bus Crowd!

My name is Laura Caligiuri and I'm a VW enthusiast.  I own a '74 aircooled Beetle that's currently in the restoration process. (http://users3.ev1_dot_net/~nuklhed/home.htm)  I also have an '03 20th Anniversary Edition GTI (http://users3.ev1_dot_net/~nuklhed/mycar.jpeg) and (http://users3.ev1_dot_net/~nuklhed/mycar2.jpeg).

My reason for contacting you is to see if you can assist in helping Volkswagen locate a stock looking Bus.  The year is not as important as its look - they're not looking for a customized Bus, just stock.

The purpose is for the inclusion in the Living Volkswagen Event which is a part of the Phaeton Premiere taking place at the W Hotel in Manhattan this Thursday, November 13th.  My GTI will be on display at this event and the organizers (Volkswagen's marketing firm, Arnold) asked if I could help round up a vintage Bus.  

I am a member of www.vwvortex_dot_com, the largest on-line Volkswagen enthusiast community (and the second largest on-line bulletin board community!!) and you can view of post from one of the Arnold guys on the Phaeton forum at VWVortex. (http://forums.vwvortex_dot_com/zerothread?id=1099200)  

If any vintage VW Bus owners are interested in taking part in this really cool event and can bring their bus to the W hotel in Manhattan on Thursday, they will get to see and test drive the new Phaeton sedan.  This is why I'm excited to be a part of the show.  

I was wondering if you could pass this information along to your community as there might be someone interested in participating.  

If you need to contact me, you can e-mail me at this address (my private addy) or call me at 732-679-2465.

Thanks so much for your assistance in this matter!

Take care,

Laura 

P.S. I do not work for Volkswagen or Arnold, their marketing firm.  I was just asked to help get the word out (by Mike Sexton from Arnold) to any bus owner who would be willing to help VW out.  I will be at the event because I have been invited to show my 20th Anniversary Edition GTI at the event.   You will be able to test drive VW's new Phaeton W12, which is an amazing machine.  Here's a link to one picture gallery of the Phaeton.  (http://www.vwvortex_dot_com/gallery/gallery2.php?mode=album&amp;album=/Volkswagen/Phaeton/Phaeton)
