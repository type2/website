Subject: [VB] 12 to 6 volt starter bushing HELP
Message-ID: &lt;19991206071544.22887.qmail_at_web903.mail.yahoo_dot_com&gt;

Here is one I have not seen asked on the list.

I have a recent new buy a `59 Kombi.  Tranny was
swapped out for a `67 bus unit with 12 volt starter
bushing.

Of course 1600 12volt engine was puked.  I have a nice
running 36 hp that would work nicely in the bus.  The
trouble is the tranny (which still works well) is 12
volt...the engine will fit up and so will the 6 volt
starter...but the bushing on the 12 volt tranny is far
too small for the 6 volt starter.  I know they make a
coversion piece going from a 6 to 12 volt...but never
seen a 12 to 6...make sense.  Removal of the 12 volt
bushing leaves enough room to use the 6 volt starter
but with a fair amount of slop...and of course no
brass bushing.  What can one do to rectify this
situation without getting a different tranny or
engine.

Thanks
Tds
