yeah it may not be what we wished it would be but lets
not be afraid of somthing diffrent. the early bus
probably looked as ugly then to people when it first
came out but we see the beauty in it now, maybe the
new bus will do somthing like the new beetle did for
the older ones much more accepted....who knows maybe
people wont be flicking us off because we are moving
to slow they just might understand.no i wont waste my
money on the new bus but lets not totally reject it.
