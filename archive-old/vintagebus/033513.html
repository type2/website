On the way home from the Classic, we made a pit stop in Ft. Stockton TX. I 
ran into a fella in a '67 Sundial Camper. He going back home to New Mexico 
from the Kerrville, TX folk festival. I don't remember his name, but have 
it and his address at home.

While looking at his old bus, he pointed out that he had swapped the front 
and rear end out. He had a '75 ball joint front end and the whole rear end 
from the '75..including tranny.....in his bus. He just cut out the whole 
rear torsion housing and welded in the one from the '75. He did it all 
himself. The bus looked fine and I wouldn't have noticed it wasn't stock 
without giving it a better look. He said it drove great and he travels 
quite a bit in it. The engine was a 1776 with dual Kadrons. He said there 
was some tricky little parts, but that it definatly was worth the work. 
He'd never go back to the old set-up.

Unfortunalty it was dark and we had to get back on the road, so I didn't 
have a chance to REALLY look over the whole conversion. But judging from 
what I could see, it looked just fine. And he definatly was able to haul 
ass in it.

Don't know what all this means, but just wanted to pass along the story. 
Really makes me kinda wanna do this to one of my busses to make a 
&quot;traveler&quot; out of it.
