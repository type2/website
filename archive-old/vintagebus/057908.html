Subject: FS:1963 SO-34 Subhatch Westy &amp; 1967 Westy: Iowa

Well, its' been along time since I belonged to this list but
I'm back and I find myself in a position that I need to sell
two buses quickly.. I will be moving soon.. Had alot of
dreams but couldn't follow through.

1963 SO-34 flipseat/subhatch Westfalia.. Disassembled
condition - all window glass and interior has been removed.
Has clear title - Has lots of surface rust but only rust
throughs are the rocker panels. Mostly straight body. No
engine - but original tranny (needs rebuild). Comes complete
with spare tire table mount, all interior cabinets (in rough
condition), gas heater, all seats including flipseat and
jumpseat. And best of all has the original small tent -
yellow and grey striped- in near perfect condition- with
poles and mounting brackets.. Was originally two-tone
turquoise/silver grey special color. Would like around $1500
but make me an offer.

1967 Pop-top Non-walkthrough Westfalia. Lots of usual lower
body rust - rockers and frame. White in color.. Complete -
mostly straight.. Was driven to current location three years
ago but will not start now. All jalousie windows operable
and interior is all there. Four good tires - could be
towed.. Good clear title. $750/obo.

1966 Kombi free for the taking - parts vehicle.. no title.

Email me for photos - specify which bus(es) you're
interested in.

Vehicles are located in Indianola, Iowa (just south of Des
Moines). My phone number is (515)961-3998 (leave message) or
(515)250-6745 (after 5 P.M. Central Time only).

I hope these can go to someone who has the means and
discipline and time to restore them to their orginal glory.

Thanks,
Nathan Dennison
P.S. still holding onto my 61 Double-cab
