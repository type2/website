Subject: Re: [VB] loose heads

Hi Ronnie,
If the chuffing noise only happens when taking off from a stop or other power 
driving then sealing surfaces of heads to cylinders are probably OK.  If it 
chuffs all the time like when idling you might have burnt sealing surfaces on 
the heads which will require machining or just way loose heads.  The only way 
to tell for sure is to remove the heads or do just the below and redo the 
work all over again when the chuffing does not stop.  Figure about two days 
for the beginner to do this work.
  We do the below when an engine is a mystery to us or we know it has about 
40,000-50,000 miles on it.  All of our previous engines required alot of 
retorquing at this point exept this last one with CW crank.  Even that needed 
a few Lbs. here and there.
Best to:
1.  Remove engine.
2.  Tear it down to long block.
3. Retorque engine case fasteners in proper order and torque,
4.  Retorque head studs.  
5.  If any studs pull loose install case savers in that side if already case 
savered you need a larger case saver.  In a pinch you can install a stud with 
oversized threads on the case end, but will not work if case savered already. 
 If you case saver only one you run the risk of having another stud pull 
loose and have to do all this over again!  Over heating of the engine softens 
the aluminum/magnesium alloy cases and allows the threads in the case to 
pull/strip out!
6.  Reassemble engine back to complete and install in VW.
