&gt; &gt;  Karl and I tried to do the above on a junkyard 66kombi-camper. Karl
&gt; recently found a great junkyard engine on half-price day that was blowing
&gt; ~135 compression after we fixed the PO botched generator installation,
&gt; loose exhaust studs, missing &quot;dime&quot; in the carb, etc. It's a stock
&gt; doghouse singleport from a '71 bus with the weird left heater duct.
&gt;
&gt; '71s were dual port.  I don't think that VW made any doghouse singleports,
&gt; at least not to the US.

Harry made a typo about the year and I did not correct it......hoped someone
would not catch it....also about the upper bolt, he meant to say 'replace
with an Allen head'......

I got the engine out of a 70, not a 71. It was a fresh built engine that
someone put together using a new universal case, new looking single port
heads, a 71 bus doghouse shroud with the bus generator dished mounting plate
but a 30 amp bug generator......and yes, the belt did NOT align at all!
Doghouse cooler was there but no flaps.
We replaced the mounting plate with a flat one and used the new looking bug
generator. Put flaps in. Swapped the 68-71 heater boxes with the ones off
the 66 engine. Left the H30/31 carb and 009 it came with on for now......
Engine runs sweet.
