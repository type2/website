Had just the same thing happen last year on my baby ('66 micro). The good
thing was I had a spare, the bad thing as that it was the wrong length (I
was tempted to walk the 20 miles to the part store and strangle the little
kid who sold me the bug cable, rather than the bus cable).
Anyways, first things first. It's much less work if you leave the engine in.
The only things you need to remove are the old cable and the hex nut (or
wingnut depending on year) from the oldcable. Remember to grease the new
cable as you insert it. When I did mine, I had to pull the bowen tube as
well so that I could get it through and then reinstall the tube (but that's
no big problem). Attach at the front and then tighten the back nut and
expect to readjust a few times the first week or two while it stretches
(keep a dirty shirt or cardboard piece so you can crawl under your bus in
the parking lot at work).
With that said, the driving w/o a clutch is more difficult than replacing it
but I've found it to be incredibly useful as a great party trick (Hey
everyone, look, shifting w/ no clutch)but word on the street from a few
mechaninc friends says it's bad on the synchros, and gears if you miss=(
Anytime you come to a complete stop you MUST turn the car off before putting
it into first. This can be avoided by downshifting to first before the light
and just crawling to the light hoping it will turn but you can't win them
all=( If you want to learn and get good, do it when you have a clutch=)
which means R&amp;R of the old one. That way, when you miss you don't have to
slow down to 15 to shift back into 2nd and then reaccelerate back up to 30
to try 3rd again=). You'll find that it's usually easier to find gears when
slowing down, downshifting and such. I usually use my speedomoeter as a
rough gage(sp?) as to when to shift down. You'll find that shifting while
going up a hill is nearly impossible because you lose too much momentum.
The way that I usually find a gear is to accelerate past the top shift point
just barely (30 in 2nd) 43 in 3rd and about (18 for 1st) and then let it
coast for a bit and slowly try and ease it in. Works 8 out of 10 times, not
too bad. And when I miss, I try somemore but if i grind it, I'll slow back
down to the next lower gear and try again. Just me and my tips.
Good luck to you and may you be blessed with a non leaky bus forever=)
