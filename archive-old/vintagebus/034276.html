I believe he is asking about the use of them. Everyone knows there for the 
cargo doors. Take a look again, they have a wierd key placement, ratcher than 
the lock mechanism being in the handle itself, it has one where the &quot;flip 
interior lock&quot; would be.

&lt;&lt; it is for the cargo doors- those mechanisms move up and down to secure the
 metal &quot;rods&quot; in the hole above and below the door to lock the door. i would
 have to look up the part # to see what year they are correct for
