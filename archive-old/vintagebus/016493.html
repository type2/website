Well NQ
You got some work to do. Interior panels are nice to make sure YOU don't 
wreck her sweater or something. Flowers are a good idea. You might want to 
remove all the parts and tools and put them in a box or only the tools in a 
box(listen it would drive me nuts if i was riding in a bus and i heard the 
slidig noise and bang!!!) Put the Fire extengisher in a unseen place(My 
Friend seems to think Vw vans have a tendicy to blow up) Make sure all fuel 
lines are clamped well and you will have a great ride and maybe score some 
points.
