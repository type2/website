Subject: Correct 6V batterr for 66 Bus?
Message-ID: &lt;19990402132216.8049.rocketmail_at_send205.yahoomail_dot_com&gt;

Happy Friday and Pre-Easter Gang,
Went to the local Trac Auto to check the battery that
is in the 66, it is 6V 550 Cranking Amps.  Is this
correct?  In addition when it was tested it came up
6.2V w/only 335 CA, guy told me I needed a new one. I
plan on buying a new one if this all sounds correct,
just want to make sure I buy the correct one.  Any
recommendations where to buy the correct battery. I
don't have a 66 manual or the 63-67 Bentley so that is
why I am asking such a silly question. I am in the
Annapolis, MD area
