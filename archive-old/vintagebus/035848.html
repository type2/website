Hi Steve,
The front bearing covers on the standard suspension from 1955 to early 64 
model year have a cap that is pressed into the front drums.  The later 64 
thru 67 models have a cap with hat like rim that is pressed over the front 
drums and makes it easy to pry off with a claw hammer.  Eric&amp;Barb
