At 6:30 tonight, I went and ate supper with grandma.  She threw together a
nice simply and filing meal.  It's funny how she can take left overs and
make a nice meal out of it, yet if I try it, I end up with a bunch of food
that doesn't taste good together and even if I had the exact same leftovers,
it still wouldn't taste the same. :-)

After a little visit with grandma, I went out to the shop to see the 67
sitting there kind of forlorn without its rear bumper.  I figured I'd better
get started so on went the full regalia of lighting, MP3 player fired up,
and I cracked the doors open for a slight draft.  I set a new record
tonight - I pulled the 1600DP in 35 minutes...not bad.  It took me the rest
of the evening to pull the rear end out (redux boxes, trans, etc.)  I kept
running into fasters that were rusted so hard, not even the impact wrench
could brake them loose!  I twised off  lower shock bolt on the driver's
side, (no biggie) and impacted off the redux box bolts but one of them I had
to break loose by hand.

Now I have an assless bus but it's another major step forwards...
