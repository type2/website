Hey All,

Happy Friday.  I was just wondering if anyone has tryed/sampled with any 
luck door seals from JC Whitney?  They have a 8 piece set to do bothe front 
doors for $40.  Just wondering if they compare at all to the kit Bus Depot 
offers for $100 a door? As always on Friday enjoy the weekend.

Eric
