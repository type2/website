&gt; Well yes, I never suggested scanning and burning the originals :(
&gt;
aww, i wish you'd said that earlier thom, i kinda wished i hadnt know,
still, at least the book kept us warm for a few hours.  :)

i'm all for it all being online tho - free to all - and thank you for your
efforts.
i've downloaded them all already. doesnt hurt to keep a copy on the laptop.
when we go anywhere that goes with us. - saves taking the books as well. ;)

as for the vw copyright thing - something i havent seen mentioned - if vw
own the copyright which they still probably do -they have to fight for any
loss - what loss can be proved. gain maybe :)

i've got a few bits and pieces - 1 is the 55 workshop manual - pages are all
real tidy if you ever want to scan it.  i'll do it myself the day they
invent a scanner that turns the pages over for me.

as far as the value going up or down of the originals - theres a limited
market anyway - so who cares?
praps they will go down... praps the prices will rocket as everyone sees
what is in these useful books!
praps it'll hurt the high price sellers more than us. :)

&gt; I've been trying to buy all the early lit I can to scan and put on my
&gt; page.  There have been some choice pieces that I didn't win on [auction
site]
&gt; that I really would have lived to put up on my site, like the barndoor
&gt; safari window installation manual addendum.  Unfortunately, the winner
&gt; refused to scan it for me.
&gt;
&gt; OTOT, scanning these and making them available &quot;devalues&quot; the originals,
&gt; but oh-well - I ain't in it for the money.
