Clara,

I think the John Muir reference you made earlier was taken out of context
(it seems you're offering it as second hand anecdotal evidence that gas
heaters are fuel hogs, but maybe I'm reading this incorrectly).  If memory
serves, he was telling a story about a bus he bought via a newspaper ad that
had a typo (the &quot;h&quot; was missing, therefore &quot;gas eater&quot;).  I don't recall
Muir commenting on gas heaters in that section, I believe he was hoping to
buy a cheap bus that needed a tune up.  Muir, aside from being a great story
teller, seems to be a classic warm weather VW owner.  Given his opinion of
the auto choke, I would be skeptical of any information he might've
published about gas heaters.

The gas consumption of the heaters really isn't debatable, the fuel
consumption specifications in the manual are for a tuned heater, just like
the specifications VW gives in their manuals for a tuned engine.  Nothing
mysterious happens to them as they age to make them untuneable, if a part is
out of spec it should be repaired or replaced, just like with an engine.
It's a shame manuals for them aren't circulated as widely as the Muir and
Bentley books because that would eliminate much of the mystery surrounding
them.  Then again, fewer people own gas heaters and there's no aftermarket
for replacement parts so there's apparently little money to be made in
reproducing such a manual.  I use the early 12v BN4 in my bus regularly,
typically on its maximum setting (especially during winters here in the
Northeast, but even in the spring &amp; fall and cold summer night drives) and I
can't say I've noticed the extra consumption, and that's probably why I
never bothered to do a before/after mpg check, so I can't provide personal
numerical evidence to support the specifications stated in the manual.

I often hear these heaters maligned when I attend the shows (typical
comments: &quot;they blow up&quot; or &quot;they use too much gas&quot;) and these days I try to
resist the urge to engage in conversations with these people (which become
exasperating because they don't seem to listen) whose comments are most
often based on hearsay or if they own a heater, because they don't make the
effort to properly tune it (and it's so much simpler than tuning a VW engine
if you have the info).   

Someone posted a manual for a 6v BN4 on the net which might be accessible
via the Type2 site and I wrote two articles that appear on Sean Bartnik's
web site (http://www.type2_dot_com/bartnik/tech.htm) to help folks with early
and late model 12 volt BN4s.  I hope these articles help strip the veil of
mystery off gas heaters and people will use them to warmly enjoy their buses
in the winter.  

I also hope this post doesn't sound too cold (hehe).  I feel there is a lack
of knowledgeable voices on this subject, and it does every freezing bus
owner a disservice to offer misleading information about them.  

Ron
