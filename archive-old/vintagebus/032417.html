And another one along the same lines...of what use is the forward bumper on 
a singlecab side gate?  There is only a bumper on the body to meet up with 
the *rear* bumper on the gate...

&gt;vehicle that served to protect the body from damage when one of the 
&gt;vehicle doors was opened AND were also equipped with check straps on the 
&gt;side cargo doors. On the other hand, DeLuxe buses were equipped with the

&gt;case the aluminum beltline molding) from damage. Now my question- why were 
&gt;the non-DeLuxe buses equipped with BOTH rubber bumpers AND check straps???
