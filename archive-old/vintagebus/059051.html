Subject: Clearancing alternator for 34PICT-3

I'm building up the 1600 for my '65 single cab and trying to knock out any
problems along the way.  Noticed that the accelerator pump arm on the
34PICT-3 carb hits the alternator and prevents proper movement of the
throttle.  Talked to a few people about this and the general consensus was
to bend the offending parts slightly and grind down the screw head a little
until the linkage moved freely.  I'm not into bending and grinding parts
especially when temperature can affect the clearances so I decided to
completely disassemble the Bosch AL-82X alternator and machine the area to
give clearance.  The tear down was simple and gave me a chance to notice the
oily dust build-up in the front (FIF) of the casing.  Seems that if you have
oil flying around for whatever reason some will get fed through to the
alternator.  In my Thing the leak was from the aircleaner.  Anyway it's
gutted now and I'll have it finished tomorrow.  I was thinking about getting
it powder coated on the outside only as it has oxidized a little while in
use in my '74 Thing.  I'll pass on how it works out.

Thomas
