We have a new club website up and running. It even includes classifieds (not
exactly high traffic but that might mean some good deals). Our club is in the
Columbia River Gorge with members in both Washington and Oregon. We are
approximately 1hr. east of Portland OR just off of Interstate 84. Although not
Vintage bus specific we have more vintage busses than anything else. I think we
are up to 7 now. This will be the best place to keep track of when meetings and
our show is going to be as well.
Check it out _at_ gorgevwclub_dot_com
