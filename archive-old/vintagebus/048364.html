 Paul, 
you may be maxed out at 50, but that will get you a ticket in town. Did for my
daughter when she borrowed the bus. The big flat front end is a tremendous
radar reflector. Any my 67 isn't limited to 50. It cruses comfortably at 4200
rpm (72 mph) with the temp under 210. Full throttle on flat ground and with a
light payload will show 4800 rpm or over 80 mph indicated. But the temperature
rises before to very long. It has a 1600 DP with stock carb and heater pipes
but an extractor behind them.
