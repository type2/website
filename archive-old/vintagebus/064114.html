Subject: Motor removal - weekend

Removed the sick engine form the splitty yesterday. On a previuos thread
we had a difficult to remove bplt behind the doghouse. I experienced
this, it was difficult to get a wrnech on the nut, as it appears the 67
trans bellhousing has a ledge to catch the bolt, with the assumption a
regular nut would be on the other side. A 12 point thin ratching wrench
got it, barely. Modding the case for nut, and dissasembling the doghouse
Tin migh tbe in order here.
Almost dropped her offf the jack, she was tough to pull, couldn't seem
to figure out the right lift on the jack.
Fetished over my input shaft all night then, but she doesn't seeems bent
or damaged. Engien mount studs ate a small bit of trans metal on the way
out not too badly though.
Tues night is tear down and decking check.
If I wire cyls, I can tunr engine over, right? Just to check deckheight,
I need one turns worth.
I hope she goes right this time.
