 &gt;What: 36 hp engine, acceleration seems to lag when you step on the gas (ok,
 &gt;I know it's only 36 ponies) but if you put the foot all the way on the gas
 &gt;or open the throttle by hand, the motor will actually die!
  &gt;&gt;

no, they aren't supposed to die when you step on the gas. They dont make the 
same fweem as the later flat 4s, just like a pancake motor sounds different 
than a 1600.    Hm, how would you describe the sound of a 36hp?  

 anyway I would suspect a vacuum line leak or a clogged carb.  or a clogged 
fuel line to the motor.  But have you tuned up your bus lately? where did you 
set your timing at?  what kind of distributor are you running?  Is this a 
problem that just developed in a well running bus, or a bus you have just 
revived from sitting?
