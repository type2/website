Well I went back out there and readjusted the brakes again.   Success.  I
_thought_ I had adjusted them before; they were really not even close (live
and learn).

I just took it on the 'victory drive' around the neighborhood, and was I
ever surprised at how much better it handled.  Before there was a bit of
play in the steering; even the slightest movement of the wheel would make
the bus veer to the left or right (we're not talking a hard left into
oncoming traffic, but some definite movement).  Never having driven a bus
before 8 weeks or so ago, I presumed that was the nature of the beast.  I am
guessing that the replacement bearings made all the difference in that
one!!.

As far as the brakelines were concerned, I never thought about replacing
them until I was into the job.  I am going to tackle the rear brakes on
Thursday and Friday (I've got vacation time to use or loose in the next
couple of weeks); I am going to replace them then.

Thanks again for all the encouragement and the advice;  I would be lost
without all of you.

&gt; This weekend I have gone &quot;whole hog&quot; with the front end of the bus (I had
to
&gt; because there wasnt alot of life in the brake system and I had a leaking
cyl
&gt; on the left front.  I still have a leaking one on the back (and new shoes,
&gt; etc) but the rear end is next weeks project.
&gt; I have done the following:
&gt; Rotors turned
&gt; Inner/outer bearings
&gt; New brake shoes
&gt; New cyl (all 4 of them)
&gt;
&gt; Now that I have done everything, I can not get pressure to hold on the
brake
&gt; line.  The first two pumps go all the way to the floor, and the third time
&gt; it catches and the bus stops very nicely.  I have bled the brakes 3 times
&gt; and still have the same problem.  This was never a problem before (it used
&gt; to go down about 2/3 of the way and just would not stop).  According to
the
&gt; maint records I  received last summer the M/C was replaced 7K miles ago
&gt; (although that was ~5 years ago in actual time).
&gt;
&gt; Having never done a brake job in my life, I am betting I missed something
&gt; obvious (or maybe I need to keep bleeding).  Any guidance would be most
&gt; appreciated
&gt; (BTW I tried the archives and could not get in)
&gt;
&gt; Thanks in advance; Rich
&gt; '67 microbus (which has decided to kick my butt today!!!)
