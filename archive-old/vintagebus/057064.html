Subject: Only You Can Prevent Engine Fires

Morning, all

About fire extinguishers.....Not only am I a long-time
VW owner (29 years), I have been a career firefighter
for the last 23 years.  Heres some information on
these.

Most fire extinguishers out there are &quot;dry chemical&quot;
type.  They have a powder (usually mono ammonium
phophate) that interferes with the chemical chain
reaction to put out the fire.  All extinguishers are
rated by their ability to put out different types of
fires.  &quot;A&quot; is ordinary combustibles (wood, paper),
&quot;B&quot; is flammable liquids, &quot;C&quot; is safe to use on
energized electrical equipment, &quot;D&quot; is flammable
metals (sodium, magnesium), etc...  The typical 10
pound dry chemical out there is rated 4A, 60B, C,
meaning it will put out, by Joe Citizen, 4 square feet
of ordinary combustibles, 60 square feet of flammable
liquids, and can be used on energized electrical
equipment.  When tested by UL, FM or other testing
organizations, this means the expert was able to put
out 4 times the coverage it is rated for.

A couple of things.....Flowing, burning flammable
liquids wont be put out.  So kill the fuel pump,
ignition, so the fuel flow stops.  It can reflash
without warning, so be alert.  The powder gets
everywhere!!!  If the powder gets into sensitive
electronic stuff (computers), it is usually toast
anyway.

Buy a nice sized one with a metal body and head.  The
previous described 10 pound model works pretty well. 
Firmly mount or secure as these things are not too
cool if you have an accident, as these make nice
missiles.  They should be pressure tested every 6
years by a certified shop.  Every once in a while,
take it and turn upside down to &quot;unsettle&quot; the powder.
 If the pressure has leaked off out of the green, get
it serviced.  If you use it, get it recharged.  As
long as it is still sealed and pressure is up, they
stay good for a long, long time.  If getting a
recharge, call around, prices can vary a lot, and
sometimes it is just cheaper to buy a new one.  Mount
the extinguisher within reach if possible, you dont
want to be climbing around the back of a bus, looking
for an extinguisher when its on fire.  

Hope this helps,
Chuck
