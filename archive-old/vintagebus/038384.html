I have to admit that suspension is an area I neither understand nor have
experience.  And I find it a pain to work this stuff without a lift.

The price tiy reference of the parts don't scare me too much.  Is this the
type of stuff that a good VW repair shop (aircooled specialist) could do
better than I?  We talking a few hours of labor for a place that knows how
to do this with a lift?  Or can such a problem be a major project?

I only have photos and owner's details on the bus.  Can't do my own tests.
Just trying to get a ballpark on worst case if I ended up paying a shop to
do the repairs.

I presume the owner's &quot;shimmy&quot; means it shakes as opposed to wanders.  Not
sure why he thinks it is the steering box, as he has a few other splits and
I'm assuming he knows something.  Maybe not...

Appreciate all the replies!  Very informative...

The front end as a unit can be had for about $100-150 from a junkyard.
Another $100 for all new tie rods and shocks; another $35 for bearings, if
needed.

If I found a bus with a bad steering/front end assy, I'd plan on spending
$200, but I wouldn't fear that bus.

If it's steeing gear box:

The hardest part, IMHO, is removing the steering wheel itself and finding a
good place to remove the steering gear. On early buses (up to '67), the
steering gear and the arm going up to the steering wheel are one assembly.
They pull down, out of the bus, but you almost need one of those &quot;pits&quot; to
pull one out into...or you need to jack the bus up about 4 feet off the
ground (safely).

I don't know about rebuilding those gear boxes or adjusting them, so listen
for someone else to answer about that.

I think you can get a good steering box for $75-150 used...maybe $200
&quot;rebuilt.&quot;
