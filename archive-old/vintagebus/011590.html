&lt;thoughtful stuff about grafting parts of multiple parts buses

Ok, that being said, I'm getting a craving for a 21-window sunroof
deluxe double sliding door walkthru barndoor.

I don't want it lowered, though.

(ducks under table)

I tend to agree that there's no harm in mixing and matching bits and
pieces.  Yes, it isn't authentic and it lowers the value of the bus,
but the real value in a bus is in the pleasure it give its owner. 
Better a nice bus on the road then two or more wrecks sitting in
fields (or going to the crusher).
