Subject: FS: 2 50's/60's Tin Busses

I have a couple tin busses I am selling.
 
1)  Bandai.  Friction bus.  Great condition.  Redish bottom, chestnut top.  $100.
 
2) VW Coca Cola Bus.  This is the tin one that is about 9 inches long.  Good condition.  $145.
 
I bought these about 6 months ago and am just trying to get my money back out of them.
 
I can email pics if interested but please do not waste my time.


Enjoy your day!

Tom Boyd
