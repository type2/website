Subject: 6v to 12v sites

i just found this site with a diagram of a simple 6v to 12v inverter:

http://www.aaroncake_dot_net/circuits/6-12conv.htm
although this one only outputs 800milliamps. that sounds like a pretty small
amount. perhaps it can be adjusted to handle more.

here is a place that sells a kit

i imagine the advantage to making it yourself, is theoretically you could
juice it up as much as possible, so you don't have to worry about not having
enough power or amps or whatever you get out of these things.

this is supposed to have something-cant get the site to work.

check out thsi site with 6v fans
