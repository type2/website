Subject: No EB visit/customs this year.  Have a Good Time

Hi Folks
            Some of you know me, some by the ton of questions I've ask over
the years.  I was planning on making EB this year, and doing some custom
diecast Buses for it.  After retiring from the Air Force and starting fulltime
in a Hospital (X-Ray), found out that I couldn't take time off for the first
90 days.  The Sat of EB will be day 90, I'll be at the Darlington show Sunday.
Anyway the Bus (Frankinbus) isn;t ready yet.  I at lease have the motor in it
and it starts, should make it out of the garage in two weeks,  Any way Chris
said no visitors anyway, just kidding Chris

        Just wanted to wish everyone a safe trip to, at, and going home from
EB. I'll will be there next year if at all possible,

Dave
