Subject: Re: [VB] repro pop-outs help...

Send them back.  All of the repro popouts I've seen were junk.  AFAIK,
there's only one maker of these stateside, sold thru various parts houses.
CE makes them as well, and I imagine theirs are better, but they're
also phat bank.

&gt; I have a set of repro pop-out frames I got from BFY(I think) and they

&gt; without too much trouble, but they don't seem to fit the bus well. They
&gt; are too close to the edge where the latch is and too far from the edge
&gt; where the hinge is. When I install the latch and close it, it pulls the
&gt; window in so tight it pulls the rubber out of the channel on the window
&gt; from scraping the door edge. When I got the DC it had no pop-outs
&gt; installed so I don't have old ones to reference. Anyone have any
&gt; experience with these repro frames? Any tips on installing them? I am
&gt; hoping that Im just doing something wrong, but it seems pretty self
&gt; explanatory to install these into the bus so I'm starting to thing I
&gt; have junk-ola frames. Any help is appreciated!!!
