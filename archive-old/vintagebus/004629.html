Need some help.  I just bought a 65 split window and the person that had it
before but a 1600cc engine in it.  The engine runs cherry but the starter is
blown.  He said he has been through 3 starters.  I need to know what kind of
starter to get.....also I heard that since the bus is 12 volt that I need to
get a converter or something ?  Need some help....I'm totally lost.....  Thx
fellas.....by tha way....this is my first VW
