Hey

I too tried all of those things to remove undercoating - that paint remover
stuff really doesn't work all that well and nor does a grinder or wire bush
I didn't try sandblasting but I can't see how it could work - my solution,
for my undercoating ..... I used a propane torch to remove the bulk, after
finding that the heat gun was just way too slow.... then after the torch
.... I got this plastic bottle from the garden store, it has a pump and you
pump it to pressurize the contents, then I filled the plastic bottle with
GASOLINE  yep, that's right, GASOLINE ..... then I used steel wool and more
GASOLINE ....  then I sprayed the underneath in small sections at a time
.... cause GASOLINE is flamable ... then I got another one of those plastic
bottles that you can pressurize and filled it with simple green and water
and sprayed the cleaned off sections with that ..... then I hosed off the
clean area and spayed metal conditioner on the clean spots then I painted
with por-15.   It was a little time consuming becuase I had to deal with
flames from the list for using .... GASOLINE.  One guy even made coments
about how I was doing something that would harm the environment ...... as if
somehow burning a gas engine and using toxic paints was environmentally
friendly.

Anyway, it worked like you would not believe and the thing about ...
GASOLINE is its about the cheapest solvent you can find .... I did try
lacquer thinner and paint remover as well as a few other solvents .. they
work as well but they did not work better .... they were no less dangerous
.... and they were much more expensive.

I was very, very carefull. Just a small area at a time and I washed
everything up very well ..... If you try ..... GASOLINE .... I'd suggest no
more than a square foot at a time and be AWARE OF CAUSING A SPARK ....
