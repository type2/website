Subject: re: [VB] Has anyone made this trip?

Partially...

Ellis took his first honeymoon (1980) in a Porsche Guards Red 1970 Ghia vert
and the first wife. Extremely little money, (no credit card&lt;s&gt;), VERY little
camp gear. Did the drive from San Diego up to near the Oregon border.

The Ghia and 1# Mrs. are long gone. I pined over the loss of the Ghia for years
and then finally saw it at a &quot;St. Mary's Food Bank&quot; show in central Phoenix.
The idealistic memories of how fresh, tight reliable and nice to drive the vert
was, immediately vanished. My warped sense of logic projected the same to the
ex. I walked away from both memories on that day.

VanBondo says, Fancy vehicles are like fancy wimmen. Both are exhillerating at
first, are proned to high maintenance, high cost, eat up too much of your time
cant really park them just anywhere and are subject to high rates of theft. Age
and wisdom is that a good old daily driver will get you where you need to be
without as many head/heart aches and worry.

Happy Valentines to both the bitch and the 'vert where ever they are...
