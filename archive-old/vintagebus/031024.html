Diana,

You forgot the most important step in cleaning your tank.  You needed to seal
it.  There are gas tank sealing products that work great.  You first remove all
the loose stuff (you did that already) and then pour in the thick rubberized
sealer and wash it around and drain....let dry and then repeat.  This
encapsulates all of the remaining nasty stuff.

The stuff is impervious to gas and in my experience works great.   You should
be able to find it at professional auto paint suppliers or I know Eastwood
sells it as does Restomotive industries (POR 15 people) in kit form.

&gt; In case you're not all sick of the topic, here's my fuel filter tale of woe:
&gt;
&gt; While I had my motor out, I decided to clean out the gas tank, as I'd been
&gt; going thru filters like crazy.  I was shocked to see about 4 cups worth of
&gt; crud come out of there.  It looked like flakes of rust and dirt.  We put
&gt; rocks in and shook it around with water in it several times (like 20) to try
&gt; to get all the flakes to come out, then rinsed with gas to get the water
&gt; out.
