&gt;
&gt;Just for fun, I looked up another high mileage car:
&gt;VW Golf TDI:  42 city, 49 highway, 45 combined, MSRP $16745
&gt;For four grand less than the Prius you get virtually the same mileage.

You also get a turbocharger, a 5-speed instead of an automatic,
2 less side doors but plus one hatchback, 1 cubic foot less passenger
room, 6 cubic feet more luggage room, and 0.7 ton more CO2 equivalent
greenhouse gas per year.

&gt;Diesel is also a bit less here at the moment than gasoline.

I have noticed this here (Oklahoma) and the EPA also gives a discount;
the per-gallon fuel prices they use in their cost-per-year calculations
are $1.63 gas and $1.44 diesel.

&gt;Also, I doubt that VW is selling the TDI at a loss like Toyota is the
&gt;Prius!

From what little documentation I can find, this is not true any longer.
http://home.att_dot_net/~john1701a/prius/prius-miscon.htm is one example.
I did find several estimates of a $10,000 to $20,000 loss per car
in news stories dated 1998 through 2000, but none more recent than
that.  They have sold about 9,000 2001 model Prii so far and expect
to sell about 12,000 in all; I really don't think they could justify
selling the Prius if it's going to be a loss of $240 million per year.
 
&gt;Plus, the TDI would get along better with my bus!  :)

Maybe.  But don't the Golfs come from Puebla?  Does your Bus speak
Spanish?  :)
