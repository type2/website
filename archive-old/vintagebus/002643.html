Hey Chris,

I researched this same question about a month ago re: welders-which to buy.
I finally decided on a Campbell-Housfeld from Lowe's. Sear's and Home Depot
use to carry welders, but both stores discontinued their stock within the
last year or so. At Lowes, I bought the highest model CH Wire fed welder
which can be used with either flux core gas-less wire or mig wire with a gas
mixture. This welder came with the gas regulator, mask, small spool of flux
cored wire..ect. The entire set-up cost $299...if you go to a welding supply
and buy a brand like Lincoln you will spend the $700+ ******* I have to
insert my philosophy here... many folks will say that the brand is important
and only purchase a Lincoln or something like that. I always buy Campbell
Housfeld (sp?) from a major store. If the CH screws up within a year of
purchase, I simply take it back to Wal-mart, Home Depot or Lowes and they
will most likely replace it &quot;no questions asked&quot;. Try this with a small
supply type store and the best you can expect is for them to try and repair
your machine. I believe the name alone of a big store is worth
more...*********
The gas cylinders must be purchased from a welding supply. They cost
anywhere from $60 up.. The $60 cylinder is a very small tank, about the size
older folks carry around with oxygen. This tank will cost virtually the same
to fill with the gas mixture as a tank four times this size...appears they
kinda ream the novice, so buy the largest tank possible and it will pay for
itself the first fill-up.
I myself have just been using the gasless flux cored wire which comes with
the welder. I just purchased a large replacement spool for $45 from
Lowes...gasless flux-cored wire costs more than mig, but so far my
investment in gas cylinders/gas hasn't been needed. You may want to consider
buying the lower model wire fed welder which only uses the flux core wire, I
believe it falls into the $100-$150 range. Only problem with this rig is you
won't be able to weld stainless, aluminum, or thin sheet metal.
Hope this helps :-)

-Tom
