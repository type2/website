&gt;  I am in the process of putting the engine back in
&gt;  because I just changed the clutch and the clutch
&gt;  operating lever (that was fun).  So anyway I am trying
&gt;  to put the motor back in and it wont go back in.  I
&gt;  know the problem::  the pilot alignement tool I have
&gt;  is too large for the VW clutch and the clutch disc is
&gt;  out of alignment, therfore making it impossible for
&gt;  the engine to go back on the trans shaft.
&gt;  
&gt;  MY CHEAP_ASS SOLUTION:  I figure that instead of
&gt;  trying to find a pilot tool for it I can tip the
&gt;  engine on its front on a block of wood and have a
&gt;  buddy hold the engine with the flywheel up in the air
&gt;  level.   I can eyeball it good enough and tighten the
&gt;  clutch pressure plate.  I figure that the oil will
&gt;  shift around but as long as I let it settle and check
&gt;  the level before starting there should be no harm.  Am
&gt;  I correct in my shade-tree assumptions???

yes, you can do this by eye.  or by feel.  Although clutch alignment tools 
are available and cheap, before I knew this I would carefully align it by 
feel, and it worked
