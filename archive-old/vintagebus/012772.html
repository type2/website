&gt;Sorry of it seem like I'm Pimping the Bus Depot. But Ron is having a &gt;problem
we would all love to have. From what he has told me he's &gt;growing fast (it's
because of his price's and service). but is having a hard &gt;time finding good
help.

Hummm, sound alot along the lines of discussion about BusBoys when I wuz on
the list a coupl-a-years ago....
