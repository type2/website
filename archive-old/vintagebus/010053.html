Subject: More Weber info

For those of you who like to follow my VW sagas and are interested in
knowing a little more about Weber carbs, I have some more info included in
this post.  I would eventually love to complete a chart where it would
include the A/C jets,. idle jets, and main fuel jets that you could cross
reference for the 40, 44, and 48IDA and IDF carbs.  That's a long term
project but for now, I'm starting to get somewhat of an idea on what the
40IDF's need to run.

Now when I initially talked to Ronnie (at Kymco), he suggested a 55 idle,
160 main, and 180 A/C.  When I got ahold of him today (after 5 calls - he's
a busy &quot;in-demand&quot; guy) he said the 160 main was was too rich.
Hmmm...that's the one he suggested initially.  Anyway, I told him what I had
done to the engine and his new suggestion was that I'd need a 55 or 60 idle
jet. (I've got 55's in my jet bin)  Then I would also need a 125 or 130 main
fuel jet and a 200A/C jet.  What happens is that the idle jet in these carbs
supplies fuel up until about 3500 or 4000rpm at which point the A/C jet
kicks in to supply the fuel.  180 is good for lower flowing engines but
Ronnie said that since this engine will more than likely see higher revs, I
better go with 200A/C's.  Well as it turns out, I have A/C180's but I could
drill it out if I knew what size a 200 hole would be (I have carb jet bits
here at home I can use)  I went ahead and ordered the 125 main fuel jets so
that I could drill them out if need be to richen things up.  I just don't
know how far to drill anything out.  What would the size difference be
between 2 successive jets?  Are we talking mere thousandths of an inch?

I'll get it figured out eventually - I just need a little help getting
there.
