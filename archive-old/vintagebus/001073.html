&gt;Would it be possible to get one of those ratcheting wrenches in there?
&gt;I mean the box end wrneches with a rotating mechanism,

I thought of this and it would work well IF it was short enough.  I suppose
you could take one of these ratcheting wrenches and cut it in half but
that's a big hunk of change and you have all kinds of internal mechanisms on
these wrenches that would all but be destroyed.

Pray for a wing nut on yours. :-)
