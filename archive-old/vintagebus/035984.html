&lt;&lt; Thanks once again for all the great info that you provide!  I must
 request the next part of the question.  How is this corrected?  I have run
 into this twice myself and both times it was on a T3 case that was
 converted to a T1.  Is there a design difference in the longblock/dizzy of
 the two?&gt;&gt;
You are welcome!  There is no real differance between the type 1 &amp; 3 engine
case/distributor.  
 
        &lt;&lt; The way I picture it, there is only two times the #1 cylinder
 reaches TDC.....one on compression stroke (both valves closed...waiting for
 fire from dizzy)....and the other at the exhaust stroke (piston pushing
 exhaust out open exhaust valve, closed intake valve).  Being TDC for #1 is
 only reached twice....the dizzy will only have the rotor bug pointing at
 the rim notch twice (that the drive will slip all the way down in).  At
 least, this is what I thought.  I have found when I rotate the engine to
 TDC #1, with both valves closed that the ONLY way the dizzy will go in is
 with the dizzy bug pointing at #3 in many cases.   
         Why is this such a common confusion?  I mean...I understand why we
 dont want to just rotate the wires on the cap and go on.  &gt;&gt;
Well you only need the rotor to point to the notch in the distributor when #1
cylinder is at TDC on the end of the compression stroke for that is when you
want to burn the air fuel mixture in the #1 cylinder.  When #1 cylinder is at
TDC at the end of the exaust stroke the rotor in the distributor will be
pointing at #3 cylinder when it is at the end of it's compression stroke.  How
this is done, is that the cam gear is twice as big as the drive gear on the
crankshaft so the crank has to turn fully twice around to the distributor
point at #1 cylinder at TDC at the end of the compression stroke.  If the
distributor pointed at both TDCs of the compression and exaust stroke you
would have a real backfiring problem from your VW because both of the valves
are open during the end of the exaust stroke.     Eric &amp; Barb
