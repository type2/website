well, I don't know of any other states that don't let you pump your gas...
think it is a wierd Oregon thing.

It's funny- you know the church key thing confuses people, which way to turn
it, how tight etc,   so I just like to avoid the confusion and do it myself.
 Cause those gas door thingys just get worn out.

Never took my barndoor to Oregon.  But when I got it inspected (had not been
registered for about 30 years - since 1966-  when I got it so it had never
been in the computer and the numbers had to be verified) the guy after
checking the numbers in the engine compartment slammed the lid shut and bent
the NOS engine brace.   Boy was I steamed.   It's just unavailable, and it
had worked SO nice before.   That NOS one had come with the bus as evidently
someone else had bent or broken the original one.    So yes the stand and
watch thing.

then again I went down to Portland last night.   got a six pack of beer, and
oddly enough they didn't bag it.  Evidently it is not a crime in Oregon to
walk around with an unbagged sixpack.    Whooo heee.    and the British pub
had good pickled onions.

Clara,

I stand and supervise. When the pimple faced kid cant get the
church'key  door open for the gas, I offer to do it for him. Them I
instruct him in very specific terms exactly how I want him to fill the
tank. If he is not willing to do it right, for example, if he needs to
leave it on super-high auto shut-down mode ( read: spill over the side
mode) then I insist on doing it myself, regardless of the law. There are
many stations who know me around here, and let me pump my gas, as long
as I do it with the gas-side away from teh street, so they don't get a
ticket from the fire-marshall.
All in all , it is one of a very few things that I dislike about Oregon.


I know that they always let motorcyclists fill themsleves. The gas tank
is in just too close proximity to the rider's crotch.


Are there any other states where you are not allowed to fill your own
gas?
