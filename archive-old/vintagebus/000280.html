Hi Mike,

I have two pop out window latches for you, an ignition switch two but I don't 
have any wiring and I don't have a key for it, but that is simple enough you 
just take it to a locksmith give him the code for it, it is the number that 
is punched in to the case not the one that is punched out witch is the part 
#. and I don't really know what you mean by a &quot;door latch&quot; I have a couple of 
lock assemblies and some other inside door handles as well as out side ones 
two if that is what you are looking for. I think that I also have that piece 
which mount two the inside of the door that the horseshoe peace latches to if 
that is the door latch. I don't know if it has to be specific to the left or 
right side but if any of those things are what you are looking for let me 
know, and oh yeah make me an offer on them, I am a country boy two a farmer 
and I like to barter and bargain. By the way my parts are in Vancouver canada 
of witch I will be returning in one week if nothing happens to the bus on the 
1500km trip through the mountains of British Columbia.

Later,
chris
