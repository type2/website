Please note - I was talking about engine cases - not P&amp;C.

&gt; I'd advise NOT to clean  your cylinders this way.  I took someone's advice (I
&gt; think from the Tom Wilson book) and took my brand new piston and cylinders and
&gt; put them through the dish washer to clean all the shipping oil and grit off,
&gt; and to my horror were completely flash rusted (just the steel cylinders  and
&gt; wrist pins of course) when I opened the door.  Two frantic hours of oiling and
&gt; scrubbing finally cleaned 99% of the rust off, but I'll never do that again!
&gt; I'm not sure why it happened, but I think the moist heat during the dry cycle
&gt; and the freshly de-oiled steel equaled instant rust.
