Subject: Petronix

Steve brought this up and I thought I would ask since many people are
running the Petronix.

When the Petronix is installed is there a &quot;lag&quot; when starting the motor?  I
say this because on my Chevy truck with points I dropped in a Petronix II
(newish and does not have the lobe collar like the Petronix I) and it takes
a few cranks before catching on.  I suspect the magnetic trigger needs to
&quot;time&quot; itself before getting going right to ignite the plug correctly.

Normally with regular points half a crank and it will fire up when properly
tuned.

Even in modern FI electronic ignition cars they take longer to fire up than
a proper points system.

...Still thinking about the Vanagon dizzy swap if I can find one.  The
Rabbit and other VW sedan cars with the inline-4 do not use a dizzy that
will work due to the lower drive gear is different.

Thanks,
Adrian S. Pillow
