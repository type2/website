Subject: Re: [VB] SOTO psychos

&gt; Latest HotVWTrends... Somebody made Dave Heard mad so he tells everybody to not trust the internet for technical information. No specifics, I'd like to see the pre-edited columns.
&gt;
Yeah, WTF was up with that?  Sounded like a personal grudge against someone.  Dude, be specific.  &quot;Badly done, [Dave], badly done.&quot;

I've always kinda wondered what's in the Member's Only section of soto_dot_org (maybe a jacket?).  It says it's a
&quot;Special &quot;Members Only&quot; website access to production information, color and upholstery codes and other interesting information on vintage Transporters. &quot;

What does that mean?  He stole all the info off my site?  Information should be free!  Don't make me unleash my Samba dog!

I'm pissed now, I'm calling up VWTrends for my own Transporter column.  Get me Dave Cormack on the phone!
