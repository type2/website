IMHO the good still outweighs the bad, there are some very helpful people on
the list and others who have thought provoking opinions. I often use the
list to gain a perspective on my own involvement in the hobby. Sometimes I'm
disappointed by the responses I get when I ask a question, but, that's life.
(that's what all the people say....)
