Subject: nose ladder

Hello,
Does anyone have any information on the nose mounted ladders?  I'm
looking into getting one... anyone know where I can get ahold of one?
Will this work with any roof rack?  The roof rack I will be using can be
seen at http://www.luckyboys_dot_com/isaiah/bus.htm  Its the rack sitting on
top of Stella.
BTW...I used Plasti-Dip today to coat the ends of my roof rack
clamps...I let y'all know how it turns out.

thanks!
Isaiah
