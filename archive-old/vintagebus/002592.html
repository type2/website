In about 1979 I was stopped by the Ohio Highway Patrol outside of Lima in my
bus for going 65 mph or so.  At that time the speed limit was 55 mph.  There
I was in a pony tail with the man walking up to my bus...not a pretty
picture.  He informed me I was speeding.  I couldn't believe it!  I asked
for proof.  He thought I was trying to get out of a ticket when in reality I
wanted a print out of the radar to prove to my friends that I actually got
the old girl over 60.  He was laughing so hard at my request that he just
told me to slow it down and get going.  When last I saw him in my mirror he
was still laughing on the side of the road.  I never did get a printed read
out of the radar to prove it.
