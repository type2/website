Subject: Club Stickers

Howdy all,
 
 I have an extra piece of rear glass from a big hatch bus and wanted to hang it in my garage. I was hoping to find some old VW Club stickers to put on it. If anyone has any extras let me know and I'll send you a sase if you want. 
 
I am only interested in club stickers that are related to Split Buses and related clubs. Yes, I'll even take a SOTO one too LOL!!
 
I do have a SV2's and OCTO one at present. Thanks. 
 
TIA, 
 
Sean
