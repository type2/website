Passenger busses from 57-61 were REQUIRED BY LAW to have safety glass 
(laminates) windshields installed in all EXPORT vehicles.
Between 62-65 the laws became less strict.
Laminated (sigla) glass you cannot drill through without cracking.

&lt;&lt; I don't think it's a &quot;later&quot; thing, I think it's just a glass option thing.
 My '55 had thru-the-glass window, but my '56 had &quot;on top&quot; latches.  What
does this mean?  It means that you could use thru the glass stuff, save
your sanity, and would not have to worry about being incorrect.  

I remember someone saying those funky windows came about because of not
being able to drill that type of glass. &gt;&gt;
