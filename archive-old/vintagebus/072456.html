Subject: Re: [VB] Re: bus with ghia tranny hard to shift

&gt; &gt; You can replace the front coupler and bushing without pulling the tranny, 
&gt; &gt; but if the rear coupler needs replacing I believe the tranny has to come 
&gt; &gt; out.
&gt; 
&gt; Hi Matt,
&gt; Fortunitly not!  We have done this replacement on VW buses from Clara's 1953 
&gt; to at least as late on our 1963 buses.  We just make sure to pop the tranny 
&gt; in first or third and then once the coupler bolts are loosened swing the 
&gt; shifter to where it would be in third or fourth gear.

 At worse one might 
&gt; have to remove the shifter and then move the shift linkages forward.

which is exaactly how they did it on my 66 last spring.
