Karl and I came across a different type of side step. Heavy steel, form fit to the inside rear of the front bumper. Two bolts to the bumper and it has a two long tabs bent over the top of the bumper. I uploaded a couple of pics to www.thesamba_dot_com/vw and could be posted soon. I'll send it to the Gallery at www.vintagebus_dot_com in a few minutes too. 
Anybody seen these? Can't find a brand or part number on the outside. They're on Karl's new find. We went to check out the &quot;61 VW Combi Van&quot;. Owner told us to look for the blue and white &quot;original color&quot; van.  Not only was it a '65, but a hard top bench seat deluxe in decent  condition. Maybe it was the homebrew from the night before, but we both passed on it. Gathering our wits later that afternoon, we made plans to snap it up the next morning. Karl had more room in his driveway than I do and less room in his wallet, so the deal was made. I did get the honor of driving it 25 miles back to Fresno with no passenger windshield and one popout out. 5&quot; of play in the steering, no speedometer or lights made a cold, exciting, but safe run home (stupid too, should have taken the T2 tow bar). We forgot to pick up the blue middle mat, and need to go back and deal with them for a '61 single cab that I'd move my EV stuff into from the Thing, but that's another story.
