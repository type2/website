Subject: Re: [VB] Painting in Cold Weather

Tom,

I haven't had to write this posting in several years so it may be a bit
'rusty' (pun), but I'll summarize - you can look up the whole bit in the
archives, look for the oldest POR-15 stories.

I did the entire underside of my 67 during the two year restoration, at
the resto shop in west LA back in 94-95.

I was taught by the owner how to deal with the situation, and also
employed POR for the first time, when it was still relatively unknown. I
believe I'm the guy that first brought it to this list!

First off, forget the rattlecan junk, forget the rust converter!
Rattlecan stuff doesnt' protect, rust converter doesn't either. Read on:

I mostly burned off the existing undercoat with a commercial autobody heat
gun, much more powerful than hair dryers and the usual heat guns. When it
was hot and soft, I scraped the undercoat off. A wire wheel came next,
lifting the residue and getting a bit deeper into the rust. Areas that
were really rusty, more than just surface, were replaced that week
following, by the welder dude in the shop (I worked on it on the
weekends). The few really hard to get at corners and such, were treated in
two ways. If not too serious, I left them for the POR. If serious, they
were replaced by the welder. All in all, when the welding was done and all
was exposed, and this all occurred in LA in dry mostly hot climate, then
POR15 was sprayed carefully everywhere, in several coats. I opened up
access holes into all the channels, and sprayed in there too. Wheel wells
were treated by a 3M spray product before POR-ing. Everything was coated
in POR.

My recommendations to you:

First, don't strip down to bare metal in the cold - you're welcoming in
trapped moisture, with no way to control or avoid it. The POR and any
other coating adheres best at 65 to about 90 degrees - they all say on the
labels. With all the effort you will expend on this project, don't blow it
just because you have some time over the winter. Pull the engine and play
with that and your brakes/tranny/redux boxes/etc. You're doing important
critical work under there, that can either protect from, or expose the
chassis to more and worse rust. If you must start now, then strip to bare
metal in small sections, then spray immediately, not later, but NOW, with
the professional strength BLUE phosporic acid surface treatment bought
only at a real auto body supply house, not Pep Boys, or Kragen, OR from
POR company. Thiers is okay but weaker. They call it Metal Prep, I
believe. Get the real thing, and apply it immediately as you strip. It
will coat the metal with phosphate and it will be protected indefinitely
from rusting. There was a classic Porsche in the resto shop that was bare
metal, had been sprayed with the blue stuff, and was there for nine years
when my deluxe got there, still in bare metal. It was there when I left 2
years later. Don't ask!   That should at least hold your work to the
warmer weather and drier as well, and you can get some work done.

If you do this, be sure to water rinse the work thoroughly before applying
POR, and let it dry thoroughly at that time. Like a week of hot dry
weather, at least, and /or a high power heat gun, etc. I only used the
blue stuff on small areas that needed to be stripped but not PORed at that
point in time. Most of the stripped work was PORed that day, as it was
done.

To attempt to summarize: I removed all rust, hard to get to stuff was
replaced, or if not too serious or structural, sprayed with POR.
Everything was eventually sprayed with POR. That was nine years ago now,
and no rust anywhere, not the wheel wells nor anywhere else it was used.

Again, if you wish to work anyway, buy the pro blue phosphoric stuff at a
real auto body supply house (yellow pages), bare and apply in small areas.
Don't bare areas that are too difficult - wait til warmer weather to deal
with them, take notes on where they are so you don't forget them.

When the blue stuff is on, it usually turns the bare metal slightly
golden, or sometimes dull grey. Another thing _ I have NEVER seen the rust
converters work, at all. Everytime I used that stuff, regardless of brand,
regardless of how thin the rust was, it just rusted around it again. Rust
is difficult to remove. The POR has stopped rust everywhere I've used it.
Follow the instructions carefully, wear gloves with POR, and it will
work. DOn't get it on your skin, or you'll wear it til it wears off. Don't
breathe it either. Work outside.

If you spray it, wear a chemical organic respirator. If you smell it, stop
working, and get a better respirator. If yo spray it, run POR solvent OR
fast acrylic laquer thinner (PSL 7002) thru the sprayer every 20 minutes
til clear. Then continue.

And that's just the summary.
