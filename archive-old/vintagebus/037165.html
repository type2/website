Subject: Re:  [VB] late61/62 dash color-top or bottom?
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

I know I sent this a little while ago, but though I would try again to see if 
the gap can be filled in a bit. 

When did they change the dash/interior aint colour from being the bottom 
colour of the bus to being the top colour?   

seems to be somewhere between 
VIN 773 959  (buildt 4th May 61) and
VIN 819 010  (buildt  ?~28th   Aug  61)   (62 model i think)

could be a change for model year, or when they changed paint options Sept 1, 
61.   yes I know Aug 28 is before sept 1, but remember that previous thread 
re production dates, and how they were often a couple days fudge in there.

Anyone else out there have a two tone bus buildt  between May and Aug 61  and 
what colour was your dash- the top or the bottom- just wondering.

See it

color)

My april 61  buildt bus vin 761 xxx  has the dash painted the bottom colour.  
 It has the 
later style panels w/o pockets, FWIW, just sayig they didn't changed the dash 
colour when they changed the interiors in April  61.
