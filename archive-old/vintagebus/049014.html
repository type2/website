Type 2's have always been cool, media attention won't make it any cooler! We might have the attention of the room-temperature media piglets for a few minutes, but a few commercials or print ads can't add to what's already there. 

I'm blowing a lot of oil and air out my breather tube and oil filler when open. Compression is good on 3 cyl., one is 15 lbs. low. Power is good. Karl sez it's time for new rings. I don't know the mileage on this 1776cc with an Engle 100 cam and large dellortos and want to drive it the 8 hours to Lake Havasu in 10 days. Any insight, psychic or otherwise? Guess I'll tear it down and be prepared for rings or p &amp; c's this weekend.
