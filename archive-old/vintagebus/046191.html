I would recommend having a fiend turn the egine round with a wrench (two trns 
of the lower pulley) while you watch those valves at # 3.    Each should open 
and close.   Its kinda neat, I think so at least.   When it is mostopen is 
where you want to adjust it.  You can all see when someone else is turning it 
round if your mark at TDC is in the right plae (those marks on the crank 
pulleys can be at TDC, something befoe or after or whatever, so make sure you 
know which is TDC.  will the real TDC please stand up?
