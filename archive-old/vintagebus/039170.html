Subject: Another wheel locking query

Thanks to those that responded to my previous wheel locking query. The
free play on the plunger rod into the master cylinder was mentioned a
couple of times. How much play should there be and how do you measure
it? Is the amount of travel on the brake pedal before it meets
resistance what I need to measure?
