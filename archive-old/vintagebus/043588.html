&gt;&gt; Also noticed that my case has the notation &quot;WB&quot; stamped in it on the
&gt;&gt; rear vertical surface between the distributor and fuel pump holes.
&gt;
&gt;Cool!  The case from my 1974 Super Beetle Sun Bug has this too!  I've
&gt;wondered what this is all about as the Bug originally came through
&gt;California, then was sold to someone in Nevada, Columbus, NE, Beatrice,
&gt;NE and then to me.

I'll look through the stuff that's kicking around in the Bus.  I
remember looking in that hole under the front seat and finding
a matchbook with the phone number of an AAMCO in California on it.
(I also found a California gold-on-blue plate, EDCVOSS).  I haven't
cleaned that stuff out yet so maybe I will find another clue about
who &quot;WB&quot; is/was...

&gt;Anyone else know the story behind this?  I really doubt that Warner Bros.
&gt;had a part in this. :-)

I don't know...maybe these cases originally were used as Acme Rocket
Sled prototype engines or something.  :)
