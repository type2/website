Lessons learned for the early to late gas tank swap:

1.  Do NOT cut the hose to try to avoid cutting the neck again to get the
right length.  I did this and ended up buying new hose which ran me $18.
Probably best to replace the hose new anyway but it also meant my Doublecab
was off the road for a couple of days waiting for the FLAPS to order the
wrong hose (Grrrr).  Once the right hose came in it was easy street...sorta.

2.  Be VERY careful when tightening the bolts which hold the tank down.  I
busted one off but thankfully there was a nub of a bolt left to get a nut
and some red locktight on after some grinding and reconstruction.

All in all it was a pain in the a$$ but was worth it.  It is a pretty easy
swap.  Just some &quot;little&quot; things that slow you down.
