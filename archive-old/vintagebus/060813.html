Subject: New project for me (61DC)

I had last week off and found myself caught up with
all the honey do's so i thought i would dig into my 61
DC.  I have had it under wraps in our back yard for
about a year.  It is not in the garage and undergoing
a simple restoration.

The goal of this one is to make a drive out of it.  We
will be selling my wifes F?rd Ranger but will still
need a pick-up so what better way to solve that then
to use a Vintage VW.

Over all the bus is in good shape.  It is 95%
complete.  Solid gates and not too much rust.  (More
then i have ever tackled though)  The goal is to get
all the rust repaired, sand blast it, do the body work
and leave it in primer.  That is as far as i want to
take it so i do not feel bad using it.  (Otherwise i
will get way too involved and end up with another
Garage Queen DC)

The worst parts of it are:
-  Driver door is shot.  Rusty and bowed
-  Passenger door rusty but i think repairable
-  Front lower 3&quot; of nose rusted away
-  ding in nose from over rider contact
-  Some rocker rust under 3rd door
-  Rear heater tube cross support gone
-  Many extra holes in cab area
-  Some extra non-factory ripples in the bed

The rust parts are what will be the biggest deal for
me.  (Please see my next post if you have any helpful
hints for these)

Other then that, i am at home working on a DC.  I am
reminded how much simpler they are then the Deluxes. 
What a difference.  Almost no interior to deal with
where with the Deluxe that was the main headache.

Well,  Off to bed but i sure am excited to get started
on another VW project.

Matthew
