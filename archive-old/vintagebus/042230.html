I saw quite a few of the Great Race vehicles as I drove across US50 in
Nevada.  I didn't see the Heb, though.  Seems like it would be quite a
show to see them all together.  The tow truck driver that picked us up
after the deer encounter had picked up a Bentley with a blown engine on
US93 the day before and taken him to Austin, NV.  And here I'm worrying
about getting VW parts when I'm on the road!  :)
