I have a nice combination of boxes that fit perfectly between the rails of
the middle seat.  All my tool goodies and basic spare parts (fuel filter,
hoses, wire, duct tape) are in there, with my breaker bar and 36mm 3/4&quot;
socket laying right along one side, and my floor jack along the other.  I go
on faith with the parts, though.  Generally have a very conservative session
with the ol' girl before we leave.  She's pretty honest.  Usually tells me
everything I need to know.  If you don't try to fool yourself, and listen to
your gut and your car, chances for an uneventful trip are in your favor.
