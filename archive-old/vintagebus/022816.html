Just a couple small things under my patio that I am ready to get rid of...

Straight cargo doors (slightly primered) from a 67 Panel.  Handle is there,
no key.  All the mechanicals on it work.  Asking what I paid, $30 for both
doors.

Ready to build that hi-po motor for your bus but want to look stock?
&lt;grin&gt;  I've a 40hp case (guts included) and a set of 1300cc dual port
(yes, local shop confirmed they're 1300 DPs) heads *and* apparently a DP
manifold that (as I am told) was used on early European buses that had such
a set up.  It has a little tube coming off the neck that I've not seen on
other DP manifolds.  Anyway, want it out of the yard, asking $75 or best.

Am located in San Jose, CA.
