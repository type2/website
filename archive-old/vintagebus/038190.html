&lt;&lt; Hello,     I have a little question. I've changed my flasher for my turn
 signals twice in the last month and can't figure out why  I'm running a
 6volt flasher and I have a 12volt system with a resistor up front. 
----------------

get a 12 V flasher unit.

.................
I've
 also noticed that a wire in the wiring area a yellow wire with a dual
 female end seems to get hot. That wire is not hooked up to anything but
 I'm sure it should be, but why the heat? 
--------

yellow?  where is it coming from?  dont remember any yellow wires in the 
front of a bus- not plain yellow.   check yr wiring diagram and find out 
where it comes from.  I enjoy ripping out excess wires from bus and throwing 
it dramatically out the window, preferably in front of the bus' owners.  :)  
You may also have crusty connections somewhere.
.....................
Should I try a 12volt flasher
 or is the problem elsewhere? I've tapped up any bare wires I've found so
 I don't think I'm shorting out. The turn signals work fine when the
 flasher isn't going out on me. I just thought turn signals would be nice
 to have full time, not that most people around here ever use the damn
 things. Any and all ideas and help is much appreciated.
 Thanks Shawn
