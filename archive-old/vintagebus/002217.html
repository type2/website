After years  of doing repairs on guitars I have found that epoxy can do
wonders!  I plan in filling the cracks on my bus with epoxy mixed with a
little black powder. the kind you can get from Stewart McDonald
http://www.stewmac_dot_com/catalog/1.asp?name3=Fresco_Powdered_Pigments  With
this stuff you can fill the cracks on your steering wheel just fine. You can
tape up the cracks making a reservoir, fill them up with the mixture of
epoxy and fresco powdered pigments and when the epoxy dries, sand it with a
sanding progression of 220#, 400#, 600# and then buff it with polishing
compound
http://www.stewmac_dot_com/catalog/1.asp?name3=Stew-Mac_Polishing_Compounds  if
you feel necessary.  This is the best advice I can give. I was taught this
by John Hargiss of Hargiss Stringed Instruments jmusickid_at_home_dot_com .  Any
other ideas?

Thanks,

Kevin Sullivan
