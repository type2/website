There's some &quot;Hella Style&quot; fog lights on ebay every other week or so...
oh wait, those are $20 Japanese &quot;repros&quot;

But seriously, I've wanted a set too, but seems like everyone thinks the
amber color means they're made of gold.  I've seen them upwards of *$600*
at shows.

&gt; I would like to find some amber (preferred) or clear fog/driving lights.  
&gt; Since it is for my Binz I'll be a vintage nazi, so no reproductions 
&gt; considered.  Prefer Hella or Bosch but any 50's or 60's light considered.  
&gt; Cash or parts to trade including some cool stuff.
