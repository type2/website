&gt; &gt; Good luck and don't knock anybody's teeth out while stretching during the

&gt; Well if we gotta cram, we'll cram.  Otherwise, I might have to put on some
&gt; pimp-daddy overall shorts and tan in the bed. :-)

sounds like a plan, but be forwarned that once you cross the boarder into CA, that
any passengers riding in a truck bed must be sitting in a anchored seat and
secured with a seat belt.  One of the laws that went into effect about 5 years
ago.  Unlike old vehicle seat belt laws that we can skirt around with the old
trucks/busses this applies to all pickup trucks.

I'll try and find the code section for you, if I can't find it, one of our LTs
usually has these thing on the tip of his fingers.

Remember the Isuzu with the two seats mounted in the truck bed facing backward?
