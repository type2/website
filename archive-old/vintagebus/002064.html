&gt; &gt; This probably isn't very good advice. It's true that the aluminum
expands
&gt; &gt; faster than the steel. The problem is that expansion makes the
spark plug
&gt; &gt; holes smaller(tighter). This combined with the fact that the spark
plug
&gt; &gt; has gotten larger will make it much more difficult to remove.
&gt;
&gt; This is a problem I give my physics students!
&gt;
&gt; If you have a piece of metal with a hole drilled in it, and heat the
&gt; metal, does the hole get smaller or larger?
&gt;
&gt; It's a bit of a puzzler, and the class is usually split 50-50 on it.
&gt;
&gt; To figure out what really happens, split the hole into four quarters
and
&gt; consider one of the quarters.  When the metal is heated, every
dimension
&gt; of the quarter will grow, including the arc that was part of the
hole.  If
&gt; the arc is longer, the circumference of the hole will be larger,
therefore
&gt; the hole grows.
