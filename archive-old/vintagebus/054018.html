Subject: SPLIT WINDOW WEB SITE needs traffic

--part1_107.8c0b8c0.29276800_boundary

Hey all ,

It has been a while since I have posted to the list. I have been working hard 
on all 5 of my vws mean while my web site gets no traffic flow. Perhaps some 
other sites can swap banners with me ?  any takers ??  I have just printed 
several hundred ohio bus works shirts.  two designs one of a double cab and 
the other is a vintage panel bus.

I need some help to get off the ground if any fellow listees have the desire 
to help a vw freak get noticed.    

Thank you   John Clancy
