Subject: my bus in vwtrends!

... which is prolly what killed em.  ironically, it is in the jerome 
article; top of page 94, right hand side: see the winnebago-style 
camper at the bottom of the cliff? my bus is to the right, behind it. 
you can see the white roof and luggage rack. just beyond me is a 
eurovan driven by the nice family from tucson who gave me food :)
ok, you can stop squinting now.
