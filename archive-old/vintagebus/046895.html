Subject: Anyone want to help finish sand my panel next week in Orange Cty?
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

I am need to finish sand my panel next week so that they can paint it......

the body shop pulled the plug on doing any more work on it (new owner) the 
old owner had a stroke and the new owner got to this point before pulling the 
plug......

I paid the old owner so I do not have much to bitch about to the new owner 
who got none of my $$$$$.......and did lots of work

BUT my bus is still not finished, it has all the body work done, is in primer 
but needs final sanding......

So does anyone want to spend a day helping me finish this ????
its in Santa Ana...........I can pay you a little $$$ or trade some parts

I need to get this painted  and then let it sit before lettering it......all 
before VW Classic

please email me directly,,,,,,,thanks for any help.......,.
