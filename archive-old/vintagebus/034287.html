Hi Jdd,
Maybe if you went with all NOS brake parts that would be true.  Last we heard 
the Wolfgang disc conversion costs $500.00 or 68-71 bus front beam and you 
still have to come up with either new or used 73 and later bus disc parts.  
71-72 disc parts are not as good.  Without the vaccume booster they 
apparently are not stronger brakes though they suffer much less fade when 
overused on long down hills.   Eric&amp;Barb
