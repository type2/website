Along the same line, if any of you saw the movie &quot;Pleasantville&quot; the TV
repairman rolls up in a nice Single cab.  They don't give a long shot but
once, but it's nice.  Also, there's this nudie mag called Club(let's not even
go to where I learned of this mag) in the May 1999 issue, one of the
pictorials shows a woman, nude of course hugging all over a pretty clean
looking(she's washing it)'62ish beetle, dove blueish in color.  It's a nice
beetle. It's really funny though, cause when we saw it, we were like &quot;NO
WAY!!!&quot;, never even saw the girl, just the beetle.    So, sorry if i've
offended anyone with the &quot;nudie&quot; content.  It just goes to show that VW's
cross all boundaries of life.
