&gt;IRS reduction boxes!
&gt;
&gt;He said that the bus had what looked like bug IRS trailing arms, but
&gt;reduction boxes were bolted on. The reduction boxes instead of &gt;having
swing axles coming out of them had flanges for CV joints.
&gt;
&gt;&gt;Anyone seen this or ever heard of it? it almost sounds like either
&gt;a) something someone made or b) something that came from brazil..
&gt;
The later Brazilian hybrid/monster buses with baywindow fronts grafted onto
splittie rears had a double-jointed axle/reduction box set-up. RGBs were
located by trailing arms like a bay, but instead of CVs on the axles, a pair
universal joints are used on each side. Nice in theory but apparently not as
durable as the original swingaxle in practice.

I have a repair manual for one of these trannies and may be able to scan
pics if anyone's interested.
