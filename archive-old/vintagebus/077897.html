Subject: Re: [VB] Front door pull handles

&gt;66-67 buses had short inner door handles and a &gt;plastic handle that mounted just below the sliding &gt;front windows that you pulled on to close the door.

&quot;short inner door handles&quot;....Are you referring to the &quot;paddle&quot; type things to open the door from the inside?  You pull up on them?

I have those on my '65.

&gt;'65 and earlier buses had large inner door handles &gt;that you pulled on to close the door.

That's not what I have. I also have factory screw holes right below the slider window for the pull handle you guys are saying is 66-67.

Read carefully. WW says this is for up to a chassis number that ends in the '64 model year. 

I think '65 is in with the 66-67's.

what's up?

Billy
