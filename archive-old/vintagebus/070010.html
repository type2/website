Subject: Re: [VB] Safari Windows

I'd go with Creative Engineering.  Izzy's were &quot;OK,&quot; but you
never know when or if he's going to have any.  I tried in vain
to buy a set from him, to no avail.  I'm putting safaris in the
double cab, and they will come from CE.

&gt; I think someone said Izzy was getting back in business? What was the general 
&gt; consensus on who currently provides the best product?
