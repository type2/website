&lt;&lt;  I have never really payed attention to powder coating before. But I got a
 &gt; question, what about brake fluid, will it eat it away like it does paint? 
&gt;&gt;

Hi Volks,
No and yes.  Powder coating will not bubble up immeadiately like normal 
paint.  We did have a problem with one seeping wheel cylinder that was not 
found out for quite a few weeks.  Result was the zinc primer and semi-gloss 
(80% gloss) black power coatings did bubble in one 25mm dia. area on one 
backing plate.  The rest of the plate looked great so we sanded and touched 
up the small area with normal zinc primer and paint.

PS to Clara and other list members up in the NW of USA,
We do know of a great powder coating shop in the Puyallup WA area that did 
our backing plates (Sand blasting, zinc primering and semi-gloss.) for about 
$15.00 each.  You just have to make sure the parts are completely degreased 
and the larger the amount of parts to be painted one color the better.  In 
other words take all the semi-gloss black parts you can find all at once.
