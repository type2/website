&lt;&lt; Hey, I noted a exhaust leak between #2cylinder and head and just checked 
the 
 bolt torque.  Results:none, I thought it must have really loosened up, but 
 after 2 turns I started to wonder and sure enough the stud was coming out of 
 the case.  Any ideas what to do?  This is my only way to work, and I'll 
 gladly buy a stock engine if I need to to buy some time to get this one 
 fixed.  Anyone in WA got one for sale?  A long block would even do just 
 fine.  I doubt I could find a business open on the fourth to supply a part 
 that day.  Thanks for the help and Happy driving--Chet

There are these self tapping oversize case studs that you can use to replace 
the stripped out one.  It really is better to insert a case saver, but as 
that is so much more of a PITA at this point, try your local VW FLAPS.
