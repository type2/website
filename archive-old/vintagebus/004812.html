&gt; coupler back at the tranny.  The only way to replace those bushings in the
&gt; shift tube is to pull the tranny and engine unfortunately.  This is one
very
&gt; important task to not overlook - if you ever have to pull the trans from a
&gt; bus, go ahead and do those bushings while everything is apart.

If memory serves, I replaced mine without pulling anything except the front
section of the shift rod (the short bent one that connects to the gearshift
lever). I know I replaced them and I know I have never taken out the
transaxle myself, ergo I must have done it without removing the trans. It
made a world of difference in the shifting action, smooth and positive.
