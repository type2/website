&lt;&lt; In my case it wasn't a simple clutch cable... it was a broken cross shaft

Hi Richard,
Was the cross shaft one of those stock spot welded ones or the beefier ones
with a nice welded bead or the splined on the shaft types?  We have found
that it really pays to buy a couple of the stock one at a time and have them
welded around the base of the arms to insure that they do not break off.
