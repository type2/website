Hi Pete,
Any reputable upholstery shop should be able to do the job.  Though some will 
not want to due to liability possiblities.  We are having Dawn of PLF not 
only sew our original belts, but replace the webbing which over time will 
weaken.  Plus new fibers and weaves are stronger due to new technologies 
produced now 30 years since the belt were made.  Eric&amp;Barb
