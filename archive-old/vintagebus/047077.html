&lt;&lt; It was also my fortune to have forgotten to bring any directions, or the
 name and # of the list member who offered driveway-camping near the event,
and I remembered that the list member with camping space said he lived 'down
the road' from the swap meet.  So, we headed straight for the swap site, and
drove around looking for this guy's guys house, but no busses were spotted.
&gt;&gt;

Saw you parked there in the morning when I went out to set up signs for the
event.  Next time try one street to the west and about 100 feet north and
you'll be in the right place!  The Binz was in the garage but you might have
spotted all the other VWs (H20) around...

&lt;&lt; The swap meet itself was OK. Not a whole lot of vintage stuff to be had, &gt;&gt;

I bought it all before you guys woke up.  8-)  Try again next year!
