Subject: cb performance oil filter

well i got the oil filter in the mail today. i am planning on installing-in
the next few days. just wondering what type of specialty tools i may need
for installation. i haven't taken the rear pulley off for a while-but i
imagine i need a pulley-puller type mechanism. now for taking the old oil
pump thing out do i need any special tools, or will it just come out when i
take the four bolts off.

then for installation-it basically came with no instructions, just to keep
the filter to the drivers side.

it came with two gaskets-i assume one is for between the pump and the case,
and one between the pump and the extension arm that goes to the filter. do
you use any type of sealant on these gaskets? or anywhere in this operation?

then for the filter attachment-as i have only owned vws my bus and a newly
acquired squareback. how does the filter attach-is this a dumb question. do
i just buy one-and it is obvious? are all filters a standard attachment-just
look for the best quality-or is the way the filter attaches different
deoending on the filter?

thanks.

GO LIST!
