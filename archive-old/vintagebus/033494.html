Subject: Re: [VB] rough idle

Pete,
   I noticed the same thing on my dual dellorto setup. Seems that at idle 
one of the cylinders gulps up all the air and gas from the manifold and 
leaves just a bit for the neighbor cylinder's firing. To test, drive around 
the block with one wire off, put it back on and see if there's a difference 
in power. You'll have to look at the idle circuit air and gas metering to 
smooth out a rough idle. You shouldn't have to fiddle too much with 'em 
after they're dialed in, but then it's easier to fiddle after you know how 
to set them up. My biggest problem is with linkage getting loose, hope the 
Webers are better than the CB Perf. setup!

&gt;Help Please,
&gt;I have a 1600 DP with dual Webers (bought new about 2 months ago). It idles
&gt;rough. Cylinders 3 &amp; 4 seem to be not firing all that well. If I pull the
&gt;plug wires one at a time from the dizzy, you can't tell much difference on 3
&gt;&amp; 4, but you can tell alot of difference on 1 and 2. I replaced the plugs
&gt;and wires last night. It didn't seem to make improvement at all. My
&gt;question, could the carb on that side not be supplying the right mixture of
&gt;fuel and thereby making those two cylinders not fire correctly?? What else
&gt;can I look for? The engine has only 2700 miles since rebuild. Any help or
&gt;suggestions would be helpful.
&gt;
&gt;Thanks List, yall's the greatest !!
&gt;
&gt;Pete and Buck
&gt;Poteau, OK
&gt;
&gt;p.s. Should I expect to always be adjusting stuff with dual carbs on a daily
&gt;driver? If so, should I convert back to a single factory carb? Thanks
