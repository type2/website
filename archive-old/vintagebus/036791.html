hey all , 
I noticed that my 65 double cab has 14 inch rims , are they supposed to be 14 
inch on a 65 , is that like that on all trucks?  because my 1960 has 15 inch 
rims ,
help which ones are original , which ones are better , and what rims match 
my speedometer .   john   thanks in advance

they switched from 15&quot; to 14&quot; very early in the 64 model year.   regardless 
of truck or kombi.      better?  depends on what you like, bigger or smaller 
tires?
