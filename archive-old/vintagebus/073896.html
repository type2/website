&lt;&lt; I just went through 6 liters of oil on the way to work today and was 
 wondering if anyone could telp me identify the problem.   the oi seems to be 
 coming from the above the oil sending unit behind the carburator and its 
 just pumping down and running down the  left head.  Is there an oil line up 
 there maybe under the engine fan tin?   thanks in advance.

wow, you really have a bad leak.   sounds like the oil cooler seals are bad.  
 solution:  tow bus home, pull motor, replace seals .   

oil cooler seals should be replaced anytime to replace the main seal.  some 
people dont do this, meaning they get really old and chunchy.

the parts are cheap, at least.  And while the engin eis out, check yr fuel 
line, tranny axle boots, engine to body seal, grommets for accelerator cable, 
fuel line, etc.
