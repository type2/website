   YES, we do allow non-vw`s up the hill at Jerome,we don`t encourage it,but 
hey we know it`s going to happen.We all know that bus`s periodically let us 
down(believe me i know all to well,just ask kyle). It would be great if it 
was VW-only,but afterall this is a show/campout for all VW`S and VW 
enthuiast`s........
  The only thing we ask is,if you come in a non-VW and it is not camping 
essential (ie.the only thing to sleep in),please park in designated area for 
non-VW`s.We did this last year,and had no problems or complaints from 
anyone.As much as possible,for photo purposes,we want the camping area pure 
VW !.Afterall this is a VW event. Also space is getting a little tight,so 
please no` circling the wagen`s '(thanks).
