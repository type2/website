Subject: Re: [VB] Pulling to the left

Funny you should say that.  My 61 started pulling to one side right after 
adjusting the brakes, but it went away within a day of around town driving- 
think it was just the shoes resetting and the edges wearing to the new place. 
 

You might try readjusting and bleeding them.  you can do a brief check to see 
if the cylinders are leaking but checking for fluid when you put your finger 
through the drum- spin the drum so you feel the rubber cap on the cylinders.

 My truck started pulling to the left violently when the brakes are first
 applied after the truck has sat for any long length of time.  After I
 brake a few times she does not pull at all.  This combined with its long
 standing misalignment pull to the right makes it a ton of fun at the
 first stoplight of the day.  
 
 The pulling to the left just started soon after I adjusted the brakes
 (never had done it with any other adjustments).  Could I have a cyl.
 leaking on the right side front???  I've not pulled the wheels yet.  All
 new everything brakes (hoses, shoes, cyls, etc.) 1.5 years ago (10 K).
 
 Thanks.
