&gt;Could anyboby please tell me how much power (Amp) a 6 Volt Wiper Moter use ?

Bentley specifies the single-speed wiper motor at 20 watts fully
loaded.  

To answer the next question you probably have, about what value of
resistor you need to run a 6V wiper motor on 12V:

Bentley also lists the system voltages of the various generators
at anywhere from 6.3 to 7.3V.

P=VI, 20=6.3I, I=3.2A .  V=IR, 6.3=3.3R, R=2.0 ohms.
P=VI, 20=7.3I, I=2.7A .  V=IR, 7.3=2.7R, R=2.6 ohms.

So, you'd need a resistor valued somewhere between 2.0 and 2.6 ohms
and rated 20 watts or better (25W and 50W types are commonly
available).   These resistors will generally be in a finned aluminum
housing that can be bolted down to a surface, or in a sand/ceramic
housing that mounts via its connecting leads.  The resistor WILL
get hot so be careful where you mount it.
