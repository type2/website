Kevin-
Lock up the endplay with another shim and
measure again to isolate the thrust error.
Your current updated endplay measurement is still including
the thrust error- subtract it and the real endplay will be less.

I have found that there is a range of tolerance in new main
bearings- Koblenschmidt is the fattest on the case side , Mahle is next, and
Metal Leve is smallest- This is all in a range of tenth's inside of
.001&quot;-.0015&quot;
This is not to say that one is better than the other, just that everything
must be measured- It may be such that you get a better fit with one
than the other. Remember, a crank is only .001&quot; from fresh to worn out.
Same with the case. That clamping force is around .001&quot;- .0015&quot;.
Just picture the effect on the center main- it is a split shell and is held
only on the dowel. And runout on a good crank is .001&quot;  Lots of things
here are only good inside .001&quot;

You can get lots of miles with what you have right now. It'a a running
engine.
You can mount it back in easy enough to take a cold compression test.
( Correct way is with a warm engine, but cold #'s indicate a trend ). ).
Take it apart, and it's just parts, many of which won't be reinstalled on a
rebuild.
*Cam plug in backward ? That is your major clue. Take it apart and you will
find more.
The bearings are marked, and the crank measurement will tell you what you
have now.
When they didn't mic the case, there was a big unknown regarding that
clamping force
which the factory requires to make a full service life. Don't make the
measurements, and
you can wind up with a brand new worn-out engine.

That case is actually made of peanut butter, it expands and contracts.
There aren't that many main bearings to hold that spinning mass of forged
steel,
certainly no extra ones. They need to be stable to control it. Let one end
run loose
and vibration does the rest.

I'm in western NY. In addition to align-bore, I also powdercoat my cases.
This combines stress-relief with an attractive finish. But that's just list
flame-bait.

&gt; Well, at a glance, the lower-end of the engine seems to have rebuilt. The
cam plug is in backward
&gt; (concave side pointing front). It's possible that when it was rebuilt,
they didn't align bore it and
&gt; just put in new std or oversize mains with a turned crank.
&gt;
&gt; Taking the worn dimensions of my shims, .008, .010, and .011, and the
corresponding unworn
&gt; dimensions of new shims, .0095, .0118, and .0118 into account, if I were
to put new shims back in, I
&gt; would be within the wear limit.
&gt;
&gt;                                               .0095 - .008 = .0015
&gt;                                               .0118 - .010 = .0018
&gt;                                               .0118 - .011 = .0008
&gt;
&gt; total reduction in end play with new shims = .0031
&gt;
&gt; new end play = .008 - 0031 = .0049
&gt;
&gt; This still leaves the problem with the wear in the case at the thrust
bearing. This is something you
&gt; just can't get around with any amount of math.
&gt;
&gt; The engine ran very strong before I took it out. I removed it to replace
some tin and to replace the
&gt; intake manifold that was leaking. I didn't do a compression check on it
because it was running so
&gt; good. I became concerned with the end play when I could hear a thunk when
I turned the engine back
&gt; and forth by hand.
&gt;
&gt; What kind of shop do you own where you to do align boring and where are
you located?
