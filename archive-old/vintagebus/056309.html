Anyone know what size tank is standard equipment in a '58 single cab? =
The PO of mine said he put in a larger tank and I was thinking Bay tanks =
were 15 gallons.  I ran out of gas the other day and when I filled up I =
only could put in 15.  Didn't put in that much from the gas can.  Anyone =
know?
