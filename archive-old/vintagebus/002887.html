Subject: Fw: Enclosure for Gas tank divider panel flange

Trying to locate Kelly (of Metwiz fame). I sent this message to him via
pmail but I must have the wrong email addy since I got no answer. If anyone
has his correct addy, please pmail me. (Sorry for the off topic post Thom)

If anyone else has any ideas on how I can repro this piece, please let me
know.


&gt; Kelly,
&gt;
&gt; Have you ever seen the two divider panels that enclose the gas tank
&gt; compartment on a double cab? There is a flange that attaches to the cargo
&gt; floor and runs along the width of the cargo area that the 2 divider panels
&gt; for this enclosure screw into. I was wondering if you would consider
fabbing
&gt; this piece for me.
&gt;
&gt; I am restoring a '65 DC and have a pretty good workshop to do most of the
&gt; work. I have already replaced the cab floor, the right rear corner and am
&gt; now working on the rockers and cargo floor. Since the cargo floor had to
be
&gt; completely removed, the piece I'm asking about had to go too. I can fab
some
&gt; things but, I don't have the equipment to do this piece.
&gt;
&gt; Let me know if I've described it well enough for you. If not, I can call
you
&gt; to describe it better.
&gt;
&gt; Steve Bradley
&gt; Atlanta, Ga
