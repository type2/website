I'm having the old turn-the-key....click! problem again. It comes back every
couple of years. In the past I've solved it by: shorting the solenoid
terminals, rapping on the regulator, rapping on the solenoid, replacing the
regulator, cleaning terminals, etc. It's really due to those old ignition
wires, and I want to take care of it permanently, so I'm going to install
one of those relays on the solenoid. I've got it all figured out, exept:

I know the ignition wire goes to the smaller terminal on the relay. The
relay has two other larger terminals, one that goes to the battery
connection on the solenoid and one that goes to the ignition connection on
the solenoid. These two large relay terminals look identical and are
unmarked. So my question is, can I just try connecting them one way, and if
that doesn't work, connect the other way?

Just trying to avoid frying my electrical system, or blowing up the bus, or
...?

Thanks,
