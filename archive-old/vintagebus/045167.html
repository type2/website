&lt;&lt; Are you kidding me? Where you going and how long you going, your gonna need
Bob's limo for all that stuff if you wanna be comfortable. What about a press
and brake lathe? &gt;&gt;
Hi Mike,
Thanks, was just waiting for that kind of response.  It is amazing how much
folks think that we carry too much and joke about it.  Then when they are
broken down and in need of a part the jokes stop and they are so polite, and
pleasant.  This is a list of parts that from the experience of both need and
over 260,000 miles of driving buses that we have come up with.  Some of our
trips have been over three weeks away from home and over 5,000 miles round
trip.  If you ever are up in the NW of the USA we would be glad to show you
how little room this takes if packed right and we still have all of our
camping gear, plus plenty of room to sleep, live and drive in our 1960 panel
camper.     Eric &amp; Barb
