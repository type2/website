Subject: yet another bus sighting.
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

i just saw a commercial with some kick butt bus
content. it was a commercial for the new compaq
presario. has anybody else seen it? it shows all the
cool things that you can use the internet for. one
example was a guy fixing up a bus! he said, and i
quote, &quot;i want to fix it myself.&quot; then showed shots of
him surfing the web looking at some 3d model of a bus
and typing some questions! deja vu! at the end it
showe the kids behind the bus modelling like they were
pushing it through the snow. they posed the question
&quot;qhat do you want from the internet?&quot; the wife said
she wanted a new car. LOL. it didn't look like the guy
needed to fix anything. it looked to be a show quality
23 window. does anybody know who owns this bus?
