Subject: Re: [VB] Rear Axle Seal O-rings
References: &lt;000f01bffaa8$141603a0$ee1151d8_at_oemcomputer&gt;

The large O-ring would stretch around the lower outer bearing.  Put the gasket
on behind the backing plate...then put on the backing plate... put the other
gasket on (there should be 2 of the same type...sorta square with 4 bolt holes
in them) after you put that gasket on...stretch the o-ring around the
bearing...then put on the cover with the 4 bolts to attatch it to the redux
box.  Dont forget the little o-ring that goes in between the spacers!

I just did this last week...

&gt; I have a rear axle seal kit and within that kit are two gaskets, a washer,
&gt; an oil seal, and  2 O-rings - where does the bigger O-ring go in my 60.
&gt; Neither side had the large O-ring and I don't see one in the bently, though
&gt; I'll recheck.
&gt;
