&gt;I merely said to the guy &quot;this is a Vintage list for discussion of Vintage
&gt;material&quot; and the guy got pissed.
[snip]
&gt;The thing I really don't get, is why I'm discussing
&gt;whether putting a Chevy motor in a 50's bus is &quot;against ethics&quot; or not. Is
&gt;this not the place where the hardcore vintage ppl hang, hence the list
name?

I do not recall ever reading or hearing that this list is only for the
discussion of 'correct' vintage material. We talk about radial tires, Type
IV conversions, fuel injection, 6-12 volt conversions, later models
trannies, disc brake conversions, etc. This list is for discussing pre-'68
split windshield buses. It doesn't matter whether stock or custom. If
correct vintage material is all you want to read about, you must filter well
over half of the discussion on this list. Sure, this guy asking about
hacking an old one for a V8 will be about as popular as asking PETA what is
the best way to cook meat, but he is more than welcome to ask. Several of us
on the list have V8 buses, several more have various other forms of
repowered vehicles, even electric. If you don't like it, my advice would be
not to do such a conversion on your own vehicle, and if one is offered for
sale, I would strongly advise you not to buy it.
