&gt; Well I got a solicitation in my email and couple of weeks ago for &quot;free&quot;
&gt; business cards at www.vistaprint_dot_com - it ended up costing me around $14.00
&gt; because of all the neat online features you can do to customize the card.  I
&gt; ended up with a box of 250 of this card:

Hey NQ,
You could start a new trend here.  Since you mentioned that at one time you were
a licensed ham radio operator, I figure this is appropriate.

For the benefit of others, hams hav post card sized cards that are called QSL
cards.  They are exchanged whenever a contact is made with another station.
Awards are given for &quot;Worked All States&quot; (WAS), &quot;Worked all Counties&quot; (WAC), and
on and on.

We could take the idea, make up a bunch of bus business cards and at every
outing, exchange cards with those you haven't met before.
There could be a WAB, WAL, ...BAB...       (you figure them out)

I guess I could go on but that's enough for the idea.

Scott
