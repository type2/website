Subject: Re: [VB] RE: '62 Westy for sale CAVEOT EMPTOR

For all the points that might be made either way, the thing that
bothers me is that a deal is a deal, and if I agreed to sell for a
price and someone came along and told me I could have done better, I
would still have to say I made a deal and honor it.

 45 minutes after my post we have three votes:
 
 1 = bus is way overpriced
 1 = a fair sale price
               &amp;
 1 = &quot;if it looks too good to be true....&quot;
 
 I guess the last vote could be construed either way....lol
 
 Happy Holidays everybody!  (and happy hunting)
