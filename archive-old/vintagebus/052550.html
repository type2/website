Subject: Re: [VB] What is Sealing Wax Red?

SWR is a really hard colour to mix, I think,  at least I have seen it done 
off at least as much or more than it done well.   Partly because it is red, 
which oxises and it can get mixed to match an oxidised bit of paint.   It is 
not orange or pink or coral, but a red you can see a long way into. sort of 
like a brick red.   There is also more than one swr.  I have been collecting 
pieces of og paint from buses and it is interesting to see the different 
shades of the same colour.     Yes partly that is because of different 
oxidation, but how much does the m code tag oxidise?   Ronnie from Havasu's 
DD is a pretty good match

Yes, you can go nuts staring at paint colours.   The PPG blue white comes out 
too green, you can amaze people by knowing the paint brand on sight.    I 
think sometimes velvet green came out a little different in different batchs 
too.   But usually people get that mixed too dark, as that green oxides 
DARKER than the original paint.  Compare OG engine compartments to outside of 
bus.
