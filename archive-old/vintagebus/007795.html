Subject: Re: [VB] Jerome as scheduled

.&gt;
&gt; Very good idea, and remember that the reason this all
&gt; happened, is that there is too much hate in the world
&gt; today.  Before we take revenge, keep in mind that
&gt; violence begets violence, hate begets hate.  Keep a
&gt; cool head, mourn those who died, and wait for the
&gt; truth to out!

True, too true. Yet, somehow, I want to nuke 'em 'til they glow. I'm getting
tired of being better than everybody else, I'll settle for being bigger and
meaner.

Craig
