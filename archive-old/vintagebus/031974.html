 Joe brought up the point of the jalousie windows being in the REAR two
 windows (drivers side..) instead of the front two...
 
 
 Well, not a much point in putting a jalousie window in the closet, is
 there?:)
 
 recall that the so-44 closet is directly behind the drivers seat..
 
 If anyone looks at this, I'd be very interested to know if the closet
 window is a popout instead of fixed glass.  (mine is.)
  &gt;&gt;

the couple SO-44s I saw had a solid window right behind the driver.  One was 
in a junkyard, the interior was gone, it was two tone blue/white, smashed bad 
in front, 67, the ambo fan was gone, but the wires still there, I took the 
steering lock, had more acessories (originally) than you could shake a stick 
at.

my euro delivery 65 so-42 has two pop outs, one in the closet.  makes sense?
