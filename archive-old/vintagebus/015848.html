&gt; Have you heard of Parts Place in Mich.

Not until you spammed the list with it.

&gt; If so how did you hear about us?

Your inane mass-email (aside - I receive the *exact* same message _at_ my isp account)

&gt; If you were a former customer tell us about your experience.

I'm a never-would-be customer now, and you're a former listmember as soon 
as I press &lt;ENTER&gt; in another window.
