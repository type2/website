They changed them for the beginning of the 1966 model year.  The &quot;B&quot; version (B suffix at end of part number) was used then, don't know when the A version was intoduced , sometime after 1958, but evidently it is physically interchangable with the plain/earlier version, as the 67 ed parts list shows the B version for the 66/67 trucks, and the plain version for the 65 and earlier trucks.
   So get a pair of panels from a truck through 65, and you should be fine.

the history of gas tanks in buses.  The part is &quot;Gas Tank Divider Panels&quot;.
Sorry for leaving out the panels part.  For thoses not having experience
with pick-ups, it's a pair of panels that divide the storage compartment and
the gas tank compartment.
