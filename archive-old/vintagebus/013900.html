Subject: [VB] Repairing unrepairable things (again)

Actually I could learn from you on that.  There have been a few times where
I've binked around with some made in China piece of crap with the intentions
at first of giving it a quick fix, but later found that it turned into a real
chore - but I didn't want to put it down because I &quot;didn't want the dam thing
to *defeat* me&quot; and end up spending so much time on it that it defies every
bit of logic there was.  Sometimes things just *iss me off.  I gotta know when
to put it down.

Paul

Some of it is there; I repair buses that people think are
unrepairable; but I try to streamline the process by
buying new stuff wherever possible.
