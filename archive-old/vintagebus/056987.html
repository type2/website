&gt; I just installed a 'mexi motor' in my 64 bus last month.
&gt; My last bus (66 westy) ran one a couple years ago too. I went with the solid
&gt; lifters on this motor, because it seemed the hydraulic lifters (in my 66
&gt; bus) would loose thier prime if my bus sat for more than a day or two, and
&gt; would take a few minutes to prime the lifters again. Kind of annoying.

I have a mexican engine in my '71, and another in my '69 bug.  Other than
changing one stud for the
dual port manifold and drilling and tapping a hole for the thermostat they
are a direct replacement.  Two years with only oil changes and valve
adjustments.  No oil leaks yet!  I'm happy with them.  Ronnie at Old Volks
sells them at a fair price.
