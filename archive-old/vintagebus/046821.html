Subject: 67 Camper Canvas Question
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

I am in the process of replacing my canvas on my 67 SO-42 Camper and wanted 
to ask someone about the white plastic strip that you staple over the top of 
the canvas attaching to the fiberglass top. Question, when you look up from 
the interior of the vehicle can you see this strip or can you only see canvas 
attaching to the white fiberglass top. I think I folded the canvas over in 
the wrong direction and wanted to make sure.

Thanks.
