Today I responded to the following ad:

VW-1970 CARMIN Ghia; dune buggies; sand rails; Webber carburetors- 44 IDF &amp;
48 IDA; Dellorto carburetors- 45 &amp; 48; 2387cc VW engine; plus many more VW
parts. Vernon, Florida 850-535-2426.

Turns out this guy wrecked while racing and is selling his VW stuff.  I
ended up chatting with Steve for over an hour and have come to know a neat
VW friend!  I have a notebook page full of his tricks and tips.  He's a good
old racer guy and really knows his stuff.

First off, the 2387cc engine is one he built and fired but never raced. It's
a t1 bugpack based race engine with cooling tins.  Price complete with carbs
$1700.  What a deal!!!   He's got 2 pairs of 44IDF's for sale for $500 a
set - they've only seen a couple of races.  The 48IDA's (2 carbs) come with
dual port intakes and pair of weber intakes for single carb application,
linkage for $700.  Not a bad price.

He also has some 36 and 40 hp engine parts.

The thing I was interested in was his tips on cleaning a 34-pict-3 carb.  I
told him how I do it and he said that 99 percent of people who clean them
fail to clean 2 places.  When their carb won't run right, they junk it and
buy another one.  Here is what he said:

On the side where the adjustment screws are is a pin that you can grab with
a pair of pliers. Turn and pull out on it.  Then turn the carb over and a
steel ball will fall out.  Save the ball and install the parts you removed
once you cleaned out the passage where the pin and ball were from.  Next you
need the screw from a taillight on a 73 or 74 Beetle (elephant's feet
taillights). Take that screw and thread it into a brass fitting in the float
bowl and near/towards the accelerator pump.  Just push the screw over the
side and it will pop that brass fitting out.  Clean out the passage and
reinstall the brass plug while leaving it on the end of the bolt.  A small
hammer works good for this.

He also gave me his personal tips for a strong running VW engine.  1) CB
Performance' idle kit for Weber carbs 2) 6a or 6al msd distributor 3) msd
coil (high capacity ignition.)  He based all of this on his experience at
circle track racing for many years.  Where he races, they won't allow ANY
MSD stuff because it gives the racers unfair advantages.

He mentioned his price for new heads being $105 used $80.

We also discussed trannies for high performance uses in bugs (of interest to
me of course!) and he told me instead of plunking down big money for beefed
up T1 trannies, enjoy the cheap benefits of the late model t2 tranny. (keep
in mind he was talking about shifting at 8g's here.) :-)  Here is what he
said:

Get a late model bay window tranny, it will bolt into the rear of an IRS
bug. You'll need the aluminum block/space that tilts the front of the tranny
down 1.5 inches to align the shiftrod with the nosecone.  Since the trans is
1/2&quot; wider than the stock bug IRS tranny, it creates some problems.  The bus
CV's will go on the bus tranny and bug axle just fine and you can either run
bug or bus CV's on the stub axle depending on what mods you want to do.  To
create more space for the CV's due to the wider tranny he does the
following:   Take bus stub axle and turn it in a lathe.  He uses some kind
of &quot;ring&quot; on the stub axle for a guide - unclear on this part.  But you take
the CV's off of the shaft and remove all the washers using only the circlip
to retain the CV's.  You turn the axles in a lathe to remove the inside
shoulder and this inturn allows the CV to slip down a little further to give
the clearance you need.  You can also have bus stub axle CV ends mated to
bug stub axles but it's expensive and not as strong.

My apologies to the vintage bus list for the non-applicable info and to the
vintagvw list for non-applicable info.  I'm tired and just wanted to share
the info with all of you.  You never know what will happen when you respond
to a classified ad. :-)


If anyone wants to reply to the ad, chat about VWs, racing, anything, he'll
glady do so.  You can call the number in the ad or email Steve at
