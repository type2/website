Dear List,
Just a reminder, don't ever use cheap looking jumper cables!  Invest the few
extra dollars into some good heavy duty jumpers.  I saw my life flash before
my eyes last night as I tried to jump my friends stupid white Infinity.  As
soon as her car started, the cable sheathing started smoking and then caught
on fire near both of our batteries. There are holes melted in her bumper and
melted plastic in my engine compartment.  As I tried franticly to stop the
situation, I could see the jumper clamps glowing red hot. I put out the
flames in my engine with my favorite sweatshirt and then used it to yank the
cables off of my battery.  I'm glad I did that quickly, cause I now that I
think about it, it could have been a lot worse. Accually it was a lot worse;
it was very scary and dangerous.  I think my mom bought me those &quot;emergency
jumpers in a bag&quot; for my bus sometime ago.  I've used them numerous times to
jump cars...  I think there might be a short in my friends car - her battery
is a month old. So with the combination of a possible short and taiwaneese
cables, I could have lost my bus.  Wooooo.... too much excitement for me.
Take my advice and buy good cables and a fire extinguisher! Sh*t can happen
out of the blue! Thanks for listening.
