Subject: Re: [VB] ics/stuck drum 

&gt; anyway, that what I was writing about before got erased accidently but the
RR drum is still stuck on the 67 and the midas guys didn't get it free, and
I once destroyed a drum before w/ a puller, and not sure where to go from
here.   any suggestions?

last week I  witnessed someone else using a large slide hammer that they
borrowed from knecht's to pull a drum off a bus that had been sitting sunk
in the mud in the soggy nw for 8-10 years. you could only attach it to two
lug bolts at a time so they had to keep moving it around the drum to get it
off even, but it worked really well. No fee to borrow it either so long  as
you bring it back in a day or two.
