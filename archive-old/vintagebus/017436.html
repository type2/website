There's one point Doug touched on that I'd like to emphasize, and that's
reproduction parts.  The duct-tape-and-bailing wire crowd, while they're
to be commended for keeping their cars on the road, don't help the
rest of us much because they don't provide a market for good repro
parts.  Some of these guys have really gone out on a financial limb to
repro parts, which is not something you can onsey-twosey.  For instance,
Mark Adair has spent a lot of time and money reproing jail bar pieces,
vent trim, kick panels, etc.  Doug has spend some OG cash for interior
bits.  Alan Schofeld has probably spent a mint on the setup for his
repro panels.

I'm not afraid to use repro parts whenever a nice original or NOS
isn't available.  My '60 is heavily repro: seat covers, safaris, mirror
arms &amp; mirrors, taillights, bumpers, rocker, front floor, interior panels, 
and soon, steering wheel.  Almost the entire frame on my '54 is repro!
