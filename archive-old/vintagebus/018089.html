&gt; p.s. the best way to make a split safe is to a)

but it certainly wouldnt look original

Such is my dilemma. That's why we have the 99 Passat.
But if I want to make the spouse feel a little more at
ease while I'm out there, I should do something. I was
toying with the idea of opening up the sunroof and
pouring a hopper load of those styrofoam peanuts in
the bus. Then I could be safe and snug like an ebay item.
