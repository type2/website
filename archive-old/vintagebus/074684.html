Subject: Sundial Documentation

This is my accomplishment for the week or so and I thought I would share.

http://www.Sundial-Camper_dot_com/docs/Sundial_Bed_Patent.pdf

File size is 694k and you will need adobe acrobat to view it.

This is the patent documentation for the Sundial &quot;Z&quot; Bed.  Invented by John L.
Nixon and submitted for patent on June 24th 1963.  The patent was issued June
8th 1965.  I PDF'd all 6 pages which include all the technical drawings and
patent verbiage.  So if you've seen that silver Sundial Camper tag with the
patent number on it here is what it is.  It's an interesting read.
