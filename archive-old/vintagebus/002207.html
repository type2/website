Subject: wiper motor wiring
Date: Sun, 28 Jan 2001 15:28:39 -0600

   Today I tackled the wiring in my 63 DC. Not very pretty. They used
masking tape instead of electrical tape and other ridiculous things.  The
worst part is that when the PO painted the bus they painted the inside also.
Now 95% of the wires are red. That makes it fun trying to figure out what
wire is what.
   The PO mounted a switch in the dash for the wipers. Flip the switch one
way and I get 7V and the other way I get 12V. The switch says 10A 250V; 20A
125V. So I have high and low wipers.
  I pulled the switch out and there are two wires from it to the wipers. The
wipers have 4 wires. 2 of them are not hooked up, one of which is brown so
that would be a ground wire. I don't know what the other one is, but the
wipers do work.
  I looked at the wiring diagram from VB and can't find figure out where the
wipers are on it. Any ideas? Plus, does anyone know if they had auto parking
wipers in 63? That might explain why there are 4 wires for the wiper motor.
In the table of Terminal Designation it says that the wipers terminals are
53. I don't see any 53's on the wire diagram.
  The original wiper switch is still in the bus. I pulled it out and it only
has 2 terminals on it. Again raising the question of the 4 wires for the
motor.
  Any help would be greatly appreciated.
