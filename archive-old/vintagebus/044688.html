Those bolts should be torqued only to qhat, 14ft lbs?  overtorqueing can warp 
that plate.   Not a high stress area.   .

 I disassembled my '60 Truck today as the driver's side inner transmission
 side plate (the one the boot goes around) was leaking A LOT.  Aside from a
 bunch of the nuts being loose (DPO?), it turns out one of the studs cannot
 be torqued down, it pulls rights out of the transmission casing.  I
 attempted to tap it a little deeper as I had a slightly longer stud but that
 failed.
 
 What are my best options?  Drill and install a helicoil?  Drill and tap it
 out for a step-stud?  If I tap it out for a step-stud, is there enough
 material there to not crack the casing?
 
 I put the stud back in with some locktite to sit overnight but I don't think
 that's gonna do it.
 
 I was able to successfully install an NOS set of heater cables.  ;)
 
 Thanks,
