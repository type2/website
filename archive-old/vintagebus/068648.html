Subject: Friday: Bus sighting in a movie

Hi guys,
I'm not sure if anyone's mentioned this one before but
my wife &amp; I just sat through &quot;Almost Famous&quot; &amp; almost
had a bus-sighting overload.
It's set in the early 70's and is jam PACKED full of
split windows and a couple of bays as well.
It was one bus after another for most of the film and
I was totally blown away by some of the really nice
ones and also the authentic &quot;worn&quot; ones.
They really did their homework in terms of what was
around at the time in cars in general.
Anyhow, I'll stop gushing.
If you like rock &amp; roll, a thought-provoking film &amp;
LOTS of buses then this is the movie for you.
Rent it ASAP!
:o)
Cheers &amp; God Bless
Andy P.
