I don't think the Binz that was for sale came out of 
Texas, but I could be wrong. The show was up in bus count from last year, 
there was 56 on hand for the days festivities. Included in the count were the 
two Binz crewcabs Dan spoke of, three highroofs, one being RHD, and the other 
two being US delivery, and a double door standard that could really use that 
infamous seat on ebay. Its is funny how buses seem to show up one year and 
then not the next, like, over the years there has been three different BD's 
there, and none this year. There were lots of &quot;new&quot; buses out this year 
including a 56 single cab with BRM's, Mark's 55 Standard,  Matt's slammed 57 
standard, and a 57 Kombi that was a transplant from NM. Oh yeah, Greg, your 
old single cab was there and looking great. It was great seeing all the old 
friends again, including the Georgia fellas ( Dave, Allan, Ted, and yes 
George) the guys from VA (Skip, Don, And long lost Lew) and Carlos from AL. 
And I couldn't forget my 'OL Bloke from South Carolina, Craig Allen.

&lt;&lt; It cost $2 to get in if you were driving a split.  The two bucks covered 
 everything - show &amp; swap.  If you weren't in a split it cost $15 to swap but 
 you couldn't park near the busses.  8-)  It wasn't a huge show like OCTO but 
 it was good sized for a bus only show, maybe around 40 busses but I didn't 
 really count.  There were about 10 each of crew cabs and single cabs, trucks 
 everywhere!  There was also another Binz that showed up.  It was the one 
that 
 came out of Texas a year or so ago.  We parked next to each other so we 
could 
 compare.  Very cool to be able to touch two Binz (Binzes, Binzi?) at the 
same 
 time.  It is the first time I have ever seen two together.  (It is for sale 
 if anyone is interested in a Binz.  Email me)  It was a pretty casual 
 gathering where the shiny busses and the primered busses were parked side by 
 side.  There were some really fantastic busses there including a great 
single 
 cab which was recently finished but was still driven a couple hundred miles 
 to the show...in fact everything was driven.  Great show.  I really 
preferred 
 it over the Bug Jam the next day. &gt;&gt;
