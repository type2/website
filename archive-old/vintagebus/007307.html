&gt;Why is Hoover credited for VW part 113-117-323, Sealing Frame?
&gt;
&gt;To my knowledge, he did not invent this part.


He is not credited with it, it is just referred to as this because it was
one of his 'Sermons&quot; which first informed most of us of the existence of
this part. Prior to that, most listees motored along in happy ignorance of
the glaring omission in the cooling system of their carefully built and
lovingly maintained buses.
