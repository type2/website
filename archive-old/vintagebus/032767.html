Subject: Re: castle nut on rear axle
Message-ID: &lt;4243f588.24439801_at_aol_dot_com&gt;

Hello,

&lt;&lt; The &quot;castle&quot; outer axle nut that holds the drum to the axle is
    46mm &gt;&gt;

For the nit-pickers out there the rear axle nut is correctly termed
a 'slotted' nut.  It is similar to the 'castle' but the hex sides go all
the way up on a 'slotted'.  On the 'castle' style the upper area of
the nut where the slots are is round.

Just some trivia for your Monday enjoyment.
