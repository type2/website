Subject: Bad Camberg 2003


&gt; Hello to all my VW friends,
&gt;
&gt; I have rather sad news.
&gt; After many rumours I stopped by Marcus Lottermann on my way back from
&gt; Frankfurt last Thursday, Bad Camberg was on my way home and after a phone
&gt; call Marcus was very happy to see me,
&gt;
&gt; We discussed many Volkswagen of course but also the 2003 event, Marcus
told
&gt; me that the carsales from their dealership slowed down very much, so
&gt; bussiness is going bad, not a isolated case as it seems to be all over
&gt; Germany, so they do not have a too large pressure from VW of Germany, but
&gt; like a good manager he is focussing on his bussiness now and not much on
the
&gt; show, he even told me when he should decide now he would cancel the show,
&gt; but officially he only take his decission around the New Year, he hopes
&gt; bussiness become better by that time so he got a little spare time for
&gt; organising the show, the problem is mainly with permissions, reservations
&gt; and all the work that has to be done long time before the event, as there
&gt; are already many people who offered him help around the weekend....
&gt;
&gt; Anyway so plse preview that there is a 50% change Bad Camberg will not be
&gt; anymore, so if You are really desperate and want to schedule, there is no
&gt; official decission before the New Year. If it will go on the date will be
&gt; like scheduled before on  June 20-22
&gt;
&gt; Whatever happen, we have to respect the decission Marcus take for whatever
&gt; reason, but we can all hope are favourit weekend every other 4 years will
&gt; not stop!
&gt;
&gt; Any further questions or remarks are always welcome
&gt;
