&lt;&lt; Anyone know a source for the felt channels for the slider and stationary 
door windows??  I know the regular stuff is available everywhere... but I 
have the wider channels as I have the latches that don't go through the glass

Hi Isaiah,
As far as we have heard these are NLA for the last several decades.  You 
might be able to glue on new automotive felt over them to restore them.  If 
you find a good source for this type of felt that does not rot please tell us 
about it.  We were fortunite to find a NOS pair years ago for our 1962 
westie.   Eric&amp;Barb
