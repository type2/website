It's not that we don't want to write anymore..... summer is usually slow
anyway with the board since everybody is kind of busy working (that includes
working around the house), vacationing (not necessarily in the Bus) and
working on their Busses...... at least that's what I think everyone is
doing.
Can't say much about my experiences since all I'm doing now is disassembly
of my 65 Standard so I can media blast few rust spots it has and get it
ready for respray....... I'm taking everything off, completely to do a
decent job. Undercarriage will get blasted and painted too. Yesterday I
started unpacking Safaris I bought from Ronnie so today or tomorrow I might
start on the installation........ That's all so far....

PS Sometimes I even noticed that some questions posted to the list never get
any attention.......... are we choosy as who we answer to????

All the best!

&gt; Well...I leave for Salt Lake City, Utah to collect my new 1963 Riviera
with
&gt; 69k original miles! I will proceed to drive the bus back home to
Sheboygan,
&gt; WI approximately 1400 miles. I just bought a copy of John Muirs book for
the
&gt; glove compartment. Many AIRS members have graciously responded to email
&gt; requests and are poised ready to help should the need arise. I will check
my
&gt; email from hotel rooms along the way and post trip updates. Long live the
&gt; list!
