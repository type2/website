Subject: suspend my subsription please
Message-ID: &lt;378566F3.C2DDBA2F_at_kiva_dot_net&gt;

Please suspend my subscription from July 12 through July 31. I'll be out
of town and am afraid the 30 to 40 emails I get a day will overload my
pc.

Thanks,
BHall

ps -- I have really enjoyed the emails, and am hopeful of buying an
early 60's microbus in the near future!
