&gt; In regards to time. I agree. Most people that I know are way-busy. As a
 nation, we cut back on the workforce, but not on the work load. I think
 we are at the all-time high for hours-worked (statistically).

A recent USA Today study lists this as one of the top causes of work
place stress, and has me on the verge of filing a stress claim.

 sorry for him not having a quarter - not that I have one, but I have
 dreams of someday not being the corporate guy with a growing family.

Buddy got a dime? 

&gt; My engine has been dropped halfway out of my Vanagon for several weeks
 now. (Oops, wrong list.) No time to fix it. So I ride my bike to work.
 (I bought a Schwinn Deluxe.)
 
List? Bus content? This isn't Friday is it? Well, okay,  my bus has a 1776 ....

Cube? Do I ever get out of my cube?
