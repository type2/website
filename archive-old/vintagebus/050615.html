Subject: Re: [VB] drafty front floor  :(

I have found it to be more effective when used with their metal ready. you
don't have to get all the rust off, but you need to scrape off the big
chunks and get down to the root of it. I cleaned my floor with a wire bush,
used meatal ready and por 15 silver and haven't seen any advance in rust.
best of all the silver actually ads strength to whats left. I didn't scrape
down or use metal ready in the belly box and it didn't bond well.

&gt; I have heard diff things about POR 15, some people say you have to get all
&gt; the rust off before you use it or it'll just rust away under the POR 15,
&gt; others say you can just cover it up.  What should I believe? It is
impossible
&gt; to get anything dry in W Wa this time of year if that matters.   I guess I
&gt; could light a campstove under it if need be.   This bus also has rust in
&gt; various places, like inside the bus at the rail the headliner tucks into,
&gt; that lip the condensation has been dripping into for 30ish years... that
it
&gt; would be hard to get the rust out of.
&gt;
&gt; Anyone have a really nice side panel behind the cargo doors for a 61?   It
&gt; needs that replaced too.  And one OG 15&quot; trim ring?
&gt;
&gt; Still,  bus made it to Red Barn/Kelley Park in the spring, in spite of its
&gt; lack of shininess.

&gt;  im just doin my 1960 mcrobus, i dont want it to be a show winner but at
&gt;  least keep rust away.
&gt;
&gt;  As im not as equipped as other, where i cant get sandblasted, i clean and
&gt;  apply POR15, as i did for my front floor, i cut the rustes through, i
clean
&gt;  the rest of the front floor and applied POR-15 over and under the floor,
&gt;  then ill need to put a ne passenger side floor section later, the driver
&gt;  side could be salvage with minor patch welding, but at least POR-15
prevent
&gt;  the rust to make more damage.
&gt;  ill suggest you the same, scrub most of the rust, clean all grease/oil,
then
&gt;  paint the floor with por15... it will remain at least forever in this
state!
