Ronnie for a used spindle?) reminded me that I've always wanted to locate=

and buy a die and tap to be able to repair any lug nuts and their holes i=
n
the drums for both my older Busses and my Beetles.  Offhand, does anyone
know the correct size and thread pitch to order taps and dies for the pre=

1968 Type 2 Busses and also for the 1950's Type 1 Beetle's?  Besides Baum=
