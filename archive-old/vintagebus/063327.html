First I must say the Binz is quite a score!

&gt;The tag reads as follows from top to bottom:

Comparing it with the tag in 
http://www.type2_dot_com/library/images/steveh9.jpg :

&gt;1750

Heat output in kilocalories per hour

&gt;6

Voltage

&gt;Benzin

Fuel (gasoline)

&gt;~~S 015

&quot;Testing mark&quot; (I think this means it conforms to German standards) 

&gt;8573

&quot;Apparatus Number&quot;  (With this you should be able to figure out the
  model number, but I don't know if there's a translation table
  anywhere.)  

&gt;1561

&quot;Factory Number&quot;  (I think this is the serial number of the heater)

&gt;(next box is blank)

So is the one in the picture.

Rick Taylor seems to be a good gas-heater guy; he put on a seminar
about them up in Kansas City.  He's on the list and will probably
be chiming in shortly.  :)
