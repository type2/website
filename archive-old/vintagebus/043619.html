&gt;I energized my new wiring last night.  Everything worked except the left 
&gt;blinker.  They all(frt.,back,.dashlight) would work for 3-4 flashes.  Then 
&gt;the only one that would work was the front one.

I'd start with the turn signal switch.  It should have the wire from
the flasher, the wire from the brake light switch, and four wires, one
to each corner.  The front and rear lights use separate parts of the
switch, because the rear ones do double duty as brake lights.

The diagram at http://www.type2_dot_com/library/electris/vw-9prong-fig1.png
will show you the insides of the turn signal switch.  That diagram is
for a later Bus with 9-prong box but everything in the turn signal
switch is the same.  On the diagram, disregard the VL and VR wires
that go back to the 9-prong box.  54Bl at the turn signal switch
is the wire from the flasher and 54St is the wire from the brakes.

Basically, if you unplug the VL, HL, and 54Bl wires at the turn signal
switch, and connect them all together, the left side should start 
flashing and should keep flashing as long as all 3 are connected.  If
this is true, then your turn signal switch is the problem.

Good luck!
