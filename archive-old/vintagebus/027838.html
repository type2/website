Subject: Re: re-painting

Regarding repainting over original paint--the 63  23 window that i'm waiting on
is 100% original--but of course shows wear and surface rust--Have no intentions
to build a show car as i drive all my VWs--I assume once the bus is in
Phoenix--the rust should stop?--that started in Florida when new--painting it
would make it Look better--But having an original 63 bus does sound cool--yet
again is it so bad to improve a bus by re-painting it?? Any thoughts out
there--Or just wait until it IS finally in Phoenix for a decision? as of now i'm
just working with photos--hopefully  TWWM, uj
PS-- am i allowed to powder coat the wheels and bumpers??
