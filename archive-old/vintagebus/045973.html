Hi Chris,
Keep the 66 tranny and rent a drum puller (Do not use the type that only 
bolts to three of the lug nuts!  Best is one that hooks the drum edge.) and 
remove the brake drums.  Check the gearing ratio by hand.  Rebuild the RGB 
and install it and the front end.  You will have 20% bigger brakes and 
hopefully the right gearing (4.1265 R&amp;P and .82 fourth will just get you by 
in todays freeway sppeds and traffic.).  If the gearing is wrong you at least 
have a core tranny to get rebuilt.   Eric&amp;Barb
