Subject: Early delux trim FS

We have the brand new deluxe bus trim described below and decided to
sell it since everyone objected to us cutting it up to fit the double
doors.   Just thinking if someone wanted it we could deliver to
BYOB/Kelly park.  Only problem is we thought of this a little late.  We
are leaving for SF area and Kelly Park on Friday (6 apr 01.)  Have to
beat the Havasu bullies to Red Barn.  :)  Otherwise it is in Hesperia,
CA, do not want to ship it - just too long.

Anyway figure $400 is a good price for brand new reproduction with all
the hardware.

Formal Description:  Deluxe bus body molding kit, 1951-1963 Bus,
identical to the original to the original profile, and is contoured &amp;
polished. Includes hardware &amp; and end caps. Holes are pre-drilled for
the corner sections &amp; a drill &amp; countersink is supplied for the
remaining holes.
No rocker moldings or colored insert

let us know
