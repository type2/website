If you look at the List of Advisory Board Members in N.A.D.A.--you will see
my name-
For a few years I have been trying to update the value of the VW Bus--If you
had seen how Low they were some years ago--you would know why the Insurance
Companies were Not paying market value for accidents involving the VW
Bus--Just recently I was able to get the Binz listed--It took a lot of
talking for NADA to believe me.-- About twice a year I receive a form to
update prices--I could really use all of your help to upgrade the value of
the VW Bus--It is Most important when trying to get the Insurance Companies
to pay out fair market value in accident and theft cases.--To date I have
not lost a case--But the value on The VW Bus is still not were it should
be--Hopefully I will receive some favorable input from the list regarding
market value of the VW Bus--
