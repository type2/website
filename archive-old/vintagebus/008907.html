&gt;     Went to the West Palm Beach show yesterday, and was able to look at
&gt;pictures that some friends took while in California. Among seeing alot of
&gt;of Everett's BD, I saw a pic that scared the poop out of me! At first I
&gt;thought it was a BD Deluxe with the roof cut off, but learned that it was
&gt;a true BD, is this true? And who won the long distance award at the SOTO
&gt;              Mike

I thought that wasn't a Barndoor, either, looked like they patched in a
Barndoor decklid.  I learned this weekend that it was, in fact, a Barndoor
with a whole later front-end welded on (later full-length dash, etc.)

Here's the story I was told, which chilled me to the bone:

The owner of said vehicle inherited a Barndoor Deluxe from his grandfather.
It apparently had some damage so they had it jacked up and were welding on
it when the whole Bus fell over on it's side, breaking all the original
glass.  Doh!  The roof was damaged so they decided to hack it off!

Stop the insanity!!!

Other stories are welcome...
