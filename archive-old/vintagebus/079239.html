Subject: Re: [VB] 21-window up in smoke

  I have been hired by an attorney on a burnt bus case to help solve the mystery of what caused the fire. Every one 
blames everyone else.


  Besides making sure your fuel lines are new, make sure you use GOOD fuel line. Just because it is the braided cloth 
hose OE style doesn't make it good.
   There is Mexican, Brazilian, Taiwan and German cloth covered fuel hose out there.  There is OE VW and aftermarket.

  I have found, through local use that most of the aftermarket hose out there is made of inferior rubber. Normal 
gasoline will work fine in it but when you add ethonal and/or MBTE (again my spl sucks) it breaks down the rubber and 
can/will cause the hose to either leak (yes through the hose itself), break, FALL off a fitting (if clamps aren't used), 
etc..

   In my opinion, if you do not have the best GERMAN or OE Mexican cloth covered fuel hose, go to your local FLAPS 
and buy good ol made in the U S of A rubber fuel hose, Goodyear or Gates and make sure its CLAMPED. 
 
  On one bus fire I looked in to, the cause of the fire was a blown fuel hose from the fuel pump to the carb. What had 
happened was the cheap, but Original looking fuel hose had started to break down, a piece of the rubber from it shut  
the needle and seat in the float bowl of the carb, thus causing to much pressure in the fuel hose causing it to burst, 
spraying fuel all over the coil and dizzy, causing the fire. Now the fuel pump should have taken the pressure of this, 
but didn't, so a fire happened.

&gt;OUCH!!!

&gt;
&gt;Volks,
&gt;
&gt;Check your fuel lines today! If they're more than a year old
&gt;replace them.
&gt;
&gt;Make sure the brass tube where the fuel line joins your carb
&gt;is tight. Make sure you have a grommet where the metal fuel
&gt;line goes through the front (FIF) left engine tin.
&gt;
&gt;And it's a good idea to fit a reserve switch or a solenoid
&gt;cut-off to your fuel tank.
&gt;
&gt;And always carry a fire extinguisher (or two)!!!
