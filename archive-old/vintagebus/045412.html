 Can the engine numbers tell if it came out of a bus? Below the generator
 stand there's the  #'s 6590055 and below that about an inch is a small WB
 (in caps) stamped on it.

a 40hp will fit equally in a bus or a bug.  The air cleaner is different, and 
so is the muffler.   I took a 40hp motor from a 61 or 62 bug, and popped it 
into a 59 SC, which I also converted back to 6V (the bug was getting a 1600 
and also the 12V stuff from the truck)  But I did leave the bug muffler on 
it, adding a bumper with bug tailpipe holes, and tossing an NOS fresh air 
40hp bus muffler in the cargo compartment for switching over someday. 

WB is for Warner Brothers, special order,  a rare motor than was used in a 
bus in the sixties hauling equipment and folks on site at the Grand Canyon 
for filming of Wil E. Coyote.
