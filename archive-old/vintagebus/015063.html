What is the gearing listed for that ~70 manual?

My views was to increase my gearing in the old split
with 1600 only to the point where VW did...the last
1600s in US buses was 70-71...and they had the best
gearing for speed....thus I would like to change my
split gearing to those bus specs....that way I am
staying within VW spec recomendations for a 1600
sp...make sense?

Let us (me) know what that gearing is in the `70 and I
wonder what the final gearing in 4th on a `70 is
compared to the final gearing in 4th on a `66-`67?

Curious?

&gt; I have a VW factory published repair manual for
&gt; '68-'70 Type 2 vehicles.
&gt; 
&gt; Publication info.:
&gt; 
&gt;     Copyright 1970 Volkswagenwerk Aktiengesellschaft
&gt;     All rights reserved   -   Printed in Germany
&gt;     42-00-0    192-1
&gt; 
&gt; This manual, of course, covers vehicles with a 1600
&gt; single port engine.

&gt; For all body styles and trims, except the &quot;Pick up
&gt; (with tarpaulin)&quot;, the
&gt; &quot;Maximum and cruising speed&quot; is given as 65 MPH &quot;at
&gt; an engine speed of 3900
&gt; RPM&quot;.

&gt; The table goes on to give &quot;Road speed at an engine
&gt; speed of 4000 RPM&quot;.  The
&gt; road speed given for 4000 RPM in 4th gear is 67 MPH.
&gt; The road speed numbers from this manual obviously
&gt; don't apply to a splitty
&gt; with reduction boxes, but the stated RPM figures
&gt; pertain to an engine that
&gt; is arguably more advanced than the earlier engines
&gt; with smaller
&gt; displacements.
