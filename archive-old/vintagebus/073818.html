Subject: Engine questions

Hi list.....

Couple of engine questions.  I just purchased a 1776 w/ dual weber 40's 
on it.  It also has a sump pump.  This engine is used with about 12,000 
miles on it and is verified good.  My questions are:

1)  The PO had an external oil cooler on it that he kept.  I need a new 
one.  I would prefer to put a stock 1600 oil cooler on it (inside the 
shroud type of thing) but not sure if this is wise.  Should I go stock 
or put on the external oil cooler?

2)  It needs a new clutch.  Will the stock 200mm clutch work good or do 
I need something &quot;beefier&quot;?

Thanks in advance for any help.  I too would have loved to be at Jerome 
but was unable to attend.  Anyone have pictures posted yet?
