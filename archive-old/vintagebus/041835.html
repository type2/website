&gt; &lt;&lt; Then the bus died on me, in a very electrical system type way. I quickly 
&gt; discovered the problem. My coil had slipped and the positive side was 
&gt; grounding out against my oil filter. I pushed the coil back into position, 
&gt; and everything seemed to be running fine. &gt;&gt;
&gt; Hi Arron,
&gt; That is bad.  The wire to the coil is one of the few that is not fused.  So 
&gt; there could be damage to the wiring and/or ignition switch!  Check how much 
&gt; voltage is getting to the coil.  Eric&amp;Barb

I think the other thing to consier is that if the outgoing side of the
coil shorted it quite possibly could have heated and damaged the coil
itself. So yes measure the 12v at the coil and if it seems ok probably try
swapping the coil.
