Subject: BarnDoor tires 16&quot; sought
Message-Id: &lt;199905152052.NAA18763_at_smtp03.primenet_dot_com&gt;

Is there anyone on the list who can acquire 5.50 up through 6.50 x 16&quot; bias
ply tires whlsale? Im blatantly trying to be thrifty. &lt;Shut up, Kyle&gt; ;-)

Pls P mail Vanbondo with details. Already know about Coker and the usual
bandwidth choking locations.
Am unable to locate 6.00 or 6.50 x 16&quot; Power Kings or JTR Premium Highway
XMC's two supposed Kelly Springfield private labels. A given source at which
a couple of listees bought them told me that the PwrKings were NLA. Nankings
are plentiful. Also available is a Denman (Hercules). It is supposedly a
Coker 6.50 private label.
Please advise privately.
Thanks,
