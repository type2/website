Subject: 23 Window winter roof cover? original?

Hi List,
 There is a 23 window presently on eBay:
http://cgi.ebay_dot_com/ebaymotors/aw-cgi/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&amp;item=338971104
I'm not interested in the bus, but have a question. The owner speaks of
a fiberglass winter roof cover, says its a &quot;rarest of the rare&quot; item.
Would I be correct to assume its an aftermarket item? Antbody know?

Michael.
