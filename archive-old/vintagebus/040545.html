Hello Susan, and list

What I ended up doing was sucking up my pride and buying the universal 
repair panel.  The corrugations are not dead on accurate, but I think they 
are close enough.  What I did was remove the cargo floor from where it meets 
the cab seat bulkhead, back to the first outrigger, across the entire width 
of the bus.  I then cut the patch panel into 4 pieces, each around 13&quot; long, 
I think.  When laid side by side, the 4 pieces fill the hole across the 
width of the bus.  It may seem a bit excessive to cut out that much of the 
floor to repair a rusty section that is maybe only 2 inches or so long, but 
doing it this way, the joint between the original floor and the patch panel 
is directly over the outrigger, that makes me feel a little better about its 
strength. I actually cut the floor back to halfway across the outrigger.  If 
you look at the outrigger from the side, it is an I beam, I cut the floor 
out to the midpoint of the top of the &quot;I.&quot;  The only bummer with this repair 
method is that on the original floor, the corrugations stop and the panel is 
flat where it meets the cab bulkhead.  With the patch panel, the 
corrugations go right up to the bulkhead.

When you buy the patch panel, you'll notice that one end of it (width end) 
is different than the other.  The corrugation stops and it has a section of 
straight panel.  That straight panel matches up quite nicely with the hump 
in the center of the bus cargo floor.  So by properly arranging the four 
pieces of patch panel, you can get the corrugations to line up pretty nice 
with the bus cargo floor.

I'm still finishing this on my bus, I have three of the panels welded in, I 
need to do some work on the b-pillar on the passenger side before I can weld 
in the fourth panel.  Short of buying a cargo floor cut from a bus, this was 
the best solution I could come up with, and so far, I'm pleased with the 
results.

Good luck,

Mike A.

P.S. I'm posting this to the VB list for information sake.

&gt;I was searching the List archives today and saw that you had asked for
&gt;help in replacing the rusty front section of your cargo floor. (Last
&gt;Oct.).
&gt;Did you ever find a source for replacement floor sections that worked
&gt;for you?
&gt;I have the same repair to make, but all the suppliers (Bus Depot, RMMW,
&gt;and a couple of others) are using what they call a &quot;universal&quot; cargo
&gt;floor section which is the wrong corrugation for '67 and older busses.
&gt;(Fits '68 to '72).
&gt;Just wondered how you ended up doing your repair, and what you used.
&gt;Thanks for any help you can offer,
&gt;Susan
