I am leaving is a few hours and will staying in the empty lot across the
street from the Winery. There are usually 4 or more people camping there in
the evening. I think there is also a car show tonight in downtown Escondido,
they block off main street for park what you drove car show, some really
cool cars if you arrive early.

Anyone leaving tonight or tomorrow to head down to Escondido from OC? 
Work decides if I leave tonight or tomorrow though.
