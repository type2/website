Hi KC
Saw your post and thought I'd try and answer your question.  I can't
explain a valve adjust as well as Mr. Muir so my first recommendation is
to read the Idiot's guide.  If you don't have one available then go to
Sean Bartnik's (Bartno-tech) page off the Type2 website (
http://www.type2_dot_com ) and read it.  Sean does a pretty good job of
explaining the process describing what you'll see.  If you get stuck or
something doesn't make sense, stop, look at what you're doing, read the
directions, and see what you're doing differently.  If it still doesn't
seem to make sense, p-mail me and we'll try to figure out what went
wrong.
Dave
