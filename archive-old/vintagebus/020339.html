Here's what I did:

I anchored a 2x4 to the studs on the wall for the length of the 
bench, about 1&quot; below the target height of the bench.  The top of the bench
sits on this.  I used 4x4 posts for the legs.  Notch the 4x4 to go under
the 2x4 to give it even more support.  I used 2x4s to build a &quot;frame&quot; 
for the bench top, then used 7/8&quot; plywood for the top itself.  I then sanded
it down all nice and smooth, and laid on several coats of varnish.
the &quot;depth&quot; of the bench is dependent on how much space you want to give up.
You might also consider making the center of the bench shallower to give
you more room to get around the bus, if depth is an issue - my garage
is 25' deep, so that's not an issue right now :)   

You can also build some shelving under the bench to hold stuff, and put
shelving or cabinets above it.  I make my shelves 18&quot; deep, which is
perfect for those fold-top crates.

I can post pix if that would help

&gt; small, but it's what I have.  I'd like to build a workbench in the back of 
&gt; the garage that will span its width (prolly around 10-12 feet).  The bench 
&gt; will be used for all kinds of repair (I hope to rebuild my front end this
