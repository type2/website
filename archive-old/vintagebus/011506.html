I was fully aware that I would be opening Pandora's butt on this one, and
truly wasn't disappointed.  Nor do I have any regrets or retractions. 
The most common response was one of appreciation for other's experiences
in using and driving an old bus, with insinuations that I don't myself. 
Not true.  I use the shit out of my bus (have good references!) and have
had no fewer adventures than anyone else.  However- I guess that I'm just
not impressed with anyone's tales of their annual roadtrip, I just assume
that if you are into buses, that's what you do, and unless you are a
truly inspired (and inspiring) writer, writing about it seems to be a lot
like masturbation.  But then I suppose a lot of writing, and art, is. In
truth I don't have much faith in (or trust for) human nature.   Anyway-
it seems that these tales are better placed on websites, than on a public
list, as some like George Lyle do.  I do appreciate them when I come
across them in occasional newspaper or magazine article, where they are
generally well crafted.  But being force-fed them daily gets a little
tedious, it would be better if they would remain in more marginal
sources.  

SO- I posed the question originally to see what other's felt about it and
i think it created an interesting discussion.  There were some very
interesting comments, both public and private, and I think many would be
surprised at who on the list are latent dissenters.  It was fun, and I I
have a habit of just kicking up dust (to many modern art classes). 
Hopefully, I've done no one any harm.

As for the guy that suggested I buy a Ford.  Kiss my SWUN sticker...
