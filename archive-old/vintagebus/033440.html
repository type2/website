&gt;Ok, the flyer
&gt;(http://www.redshift_dot_com/~taylorvw/svt/BYOB.gif) says
&gt;The show is on Sat the 21st. It also says &quot;Free parking
&gt;lot camping Fri night&quot;. If I want to score some O.G.
&gt;safaris at the swap, when do I need to show up?

As the guy who partially designed the flyer, either show up and spend the 
night Friday.  Or arrive around 6am Saturday.  I doubt you'll miss out on 
any nice OG deals.  :)

&gt;  Is the Taco feed and all the rest on Friday or
&gt;Saturday, and is there camping Saturday night also,
&gt;followed by a caravan to KP on Sunday morning??
&gt;  Is the earth round or actually an oblong spheroid?

Ronnie, John, and the LBB boys are doing the Taco feed Friday 
night.  Saturday night there is NO camping at Red Barn.  I think the Split 
Bus Club has a get together somewhere local, but I don't know exactly 
where.  The earth is halfway between round and oblong.  ;)

Another chapter member and I went down to Red Barn last Saturday to scope 
the place and hopefully make some mental notes about parking and so 
forth.  It should be a good turn out and a fun time...we're designing the 
ballots and stuff now.  Since this is our first year holding a show here, 
things may be a little hectic coming in the gate...I have no exact idea how 
many people to expect, how many will be showing, and how many will be 
swapping.  I want to personally ask everyone planning to attend to please 
be patient and understand that we're still getting this crazy shin-dig on 
its feet.  You've all been to shows before, you know how it can get a 
little turned around...so just hang in there and be flexible.  This way 
everyone can have a great time.  :)

PS: Wait till you all see the awards...they're very Silicon Valley. ;)
