will 215 75 15 tires fit?   They are wider- so?    another question I have is
how wide a tire is appropriate for what size rim.    evidently the 14&quot; rims
are 5&quot; wide and the 15&quot; rims are 41/2&quot; wide.   I am talking about width here.
I have run 205 75 15&quot; tires on my 61 NSR deluxe on the 41/2&quot; wide rims for
about 20 K miles, and am getting uneven wearing- more at the edge, which may
be due to the flex.  And I should run them at above the recommended pressure.
These are the lower rated tires PSI wise, and it would be better to get the
higher rated tires with the stiffer sidewall.  But I have not had the uneven
wear problem with 185 or 195 tires- so wonder if the 205 may be too wide for
the 41/2&quot; wide rims,      Would there be problems fitting them in the wheel
arch?    The 205s are pretty close.    actually as you have a 63 your  type2
probably have the later wheel arches that have more room (is this a
coincidence that he wheel arches changed close to the change to wider rims?)
Which in any case I am interested in the stiffer sidewall higher psi type 205
75 15&quot; tires in the Puget Sound area, as I'd like to get a pair on the back of
my truck, the loose15&quot; rims I have have ancient cracked bald glass belted
tires, which must be replaced before I put the 15&quot; wheels on the back to
counter the effect of the ball joint front beam.
