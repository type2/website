Well, dropped off my '65 at Maaco afterall, and am getting the
Presidential paint plus a little small dent/scratch work.  The manager
suggested the Ambassador paint, which was cheaper, but it didn't use
hardener.  I asked for the next one up!  Can't say I've heard of auto
paint without hardener in it!  He admitted it would be rubbery and
wouldn't sand well if I redid it in the future.  He cut me a 'break' and
gave my the Presidential, with the large vehicle charge for $350, and
body work for $250.  Will pick it up on Monday.  I'll let you know how
it turns out.
