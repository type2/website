&gt;['75 Fleetline] The far right hand fuse in the fuse box gets extremely 
&gt;hot when the lights are switched on. 

Heat means a bad connection somewhere.  Power (watts) is voltage times
current OR current squared times resistance.  Ideally all the fuses,
wires, switches, etc would have zero resistance and thus dissipate no
power.  0.1 ohm of resistance may not sound like much, but put the
current of two low-beam headlights through it (about six and a half
amps at 12v) and that resistance is suddenly dissipating four watts.
If that resistance is spread out over a wire you may not notice, but
if it's concentrated at a bad connection then you WILL notice it.

&gt;This fuse seems to be the most heavily loaded of all, since
&gt;it seems to handle the main power supply from the starter (battery),
&gt;as well as serving the headlight circuit and a couple of others.

I don't know if the stock Fleetline wiring is more like a splitty or
a bay.  On splitties, the top end of that right-hand fuse serves as
a connection point for the main hot wire from the back and the main
hot wire to the light switch and ignition switch, but the lighting
and ignition current does not actually pass through the fuse.  Bay
windows have more fuses with less things on each one, and things are 
split up more, but the headlights are still not fused.

&gt;I previously replaced the stock fuse with two short pieces of cable
&gt;with a Ford-style fuse attached, but that also overheated and melted
&gt;the plastic cover.  

The cover on the VW fuse box or the cover on the Ford fuse?

&gt;I have cleaned up all the connectors to that fuse, but it still gets hot
&gt;when the headlights are on.

Try removing the fuse altogether.  The headlights should still work.
Probably what will happen is one of the two clips that hold the fuse
in will get hot, probably the one with the two fat red wires.  If so,
you have a bad connection there or someplace very near there.

As the others have posted, the rivet that holds the fuse clip on the
back (FIF) of the fuse box and the wire connectors on the front of
the fuse box can loosen over time.  Another subtle failure that can
cause this is one of the wires breaking *inside* the insulation near
the terminal.  I had an output wire on a battery charger do this once...
I charged a battery for a couple of hours and went to remove the
alligator clips and the negative one was HOT!  Looking at the clip where
the wire attached, it looked fine...the wire came out of its insulation
and was well soldered to the clip.  The wire insulation was not broken,
but about half an inch away from the clip, most of the wire strands
had broken INSIDE the insulation.  I only found it by carefully bending
and flexing the wire and noting that one spot was much easier to bend
than the rest of the wire.  I cut the wire past the bad spot and
re-soldered it to the clip and it's been working fine ever since.

Good luck!
