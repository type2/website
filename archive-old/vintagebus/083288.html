Subject: Re: [VB] Need plywood.

Hey,

Thanks for the link. Looks nice. However, the original in my bus is in ash
ply and since I have all the old pieces, I am going to use them as forms and
cut new myself. I did find a couple of good web sites for plywood. Go to
your search engine and plunk in &quot;hardwood plywood&quot;.

Chris

&gt; Have you tried this web site:
&gt;
&gt;  (http://home_dot_comcast_dot_net/~sunrisebus/sunrisebuswerk.html).  They look
like
&gt; they have a nice selection of panels and probably have a source for the
&gt; other materials you need.
