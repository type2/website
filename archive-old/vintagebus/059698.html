Subject: Re: [VB] where's Thom?

Actually, someone else already suggested that to me. Looks like we are onto
his game. Let's all change our email personalities, send moronic emails,
and join the game!

Steve Bradley
Bradley Auto Body


&gt; &gt; Anybody know where Tom is?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Steve Bradley
&gt; &gt; Bradley Auto Body
&gt;
&gt; I was wondering that too. And then I was remembering Retarrdo showed up
&gt; about the time Thom dissapeared. Could it be a MPD? ( multiple
&gt; personality disorder )  It's ok Thom, I know a good therapist.
