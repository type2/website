&gt; Ellis installed Kuhmo 205/75/15's on the 63 EZ camper.
&gt;  Coupled with the 3.88 tranny it was great! Bad A**ed
&gt;  tires/tyres. Initial concerns with being &quot;too big&quot; or
&gt;  reducing the fan speed and thereby running the engine
&gt;  hot were quickly put aside.
&gt;  
what size engine and RGearing?

with my 65 westy 3.88/.82 4th/1.26 RG 1600 I swapped to 195 75 r14s from the 
205/75R14s to get a bit more zip.  Might go smaller.  Also we are not flat 
here, like Phoenix.
