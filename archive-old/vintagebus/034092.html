Last night i watched The Haunting, strange to say the least, but at the end
up drove the caretaker in a splitty. It was a Westy Pop-top, late 60's, blue
and white with a westy rack. It was cool because when he drove up you only
saw the view out of the windshield, and the true splitty owner could tell
what it was. Then at the end they panned away and you could see the whole
bus, much more time given to it then the bus in Blast from the Past.
