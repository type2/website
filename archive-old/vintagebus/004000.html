The worth of our chariots. They're not static objects, it's a wave of
engineering, manufacturing, maintenance, use, abuse, appreciation, ennui and
ineffable glory. Just as a wave isn't one ton of water moving from the
middle of the ocean onto the beach, it's a coordinated upheaval of MANY tons
of water briefly in a pattern. The pattern is what we have. Model this and
m-code that, mechanic A and the procedure from page 47. We're surfing these
waves, using them as our tools. Get into the details, appreciate the flows.
Buy and sell, cut and paste, litter, vacuum, patch, preserve, don't slam the
doors. We treat them like we want to be treated.
