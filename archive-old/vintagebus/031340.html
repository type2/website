&gt; Hey,
&gt; I've noticed that a lot of cars for sale on the 'net
&gt; or in online auctions have the license plate removed
&gt; or purposely blurred-out in the pics.
&gt;
&gt; Why is this?
&gt;
&gt; Is there some risk involved with people knowing your
&gt; plate?

I can only imagine that someone thinks that a perp will look up the license
plate and then hightail it over to the registered address with a flatbed and
remove the vehicle in the dead of night.

I think it's a carryover from news/reality shows blurring the license plates
while the video of the cops busting someone goes on.  Maintaining privacy
for the car thief.

Irony - Car auction, plate not blurred.  Perp looks up address then steals
car.  Cops catch the guy and the video is later played with the perps
license plate blurred.

All I know is that just about everyone knows what my license plate number on
my DC is.

As far as bus content to the above message, it seems relevant if one is
preparing to list their bus for sale or auction.
