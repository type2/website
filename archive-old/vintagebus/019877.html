Yup.  It's the classical reaction to any event of that general nature,
and is the motivation behind the maxim to &quot;get right back on the horse
that threw you&quot; (which should give you an idea of how long the
problem's been known about by the non-psychiatric-professionals).
Extreme cases (which this doesn't sound to be) are called
post-traumatic stress disorder.

Given that you didn't really have the option of getting right back on
that horse, it's going to be a harder uphill battle.  It also will get
harder the longer you put it off.  The only cure, assuming you want to
be cured (which it sounds like you do), is repeated exposure (i.e.,
driving your bus) just like they use to desensitize phobias.  Makes
sense, since this is effectively a rapidly-acquired phobia.

It might be a little easier to start off in the passenger seat and
have someone else do the driving the first few times.  Then, try just
maneuvering around the vicinity of your house (on your property, if
you've got a large enough spread, otherwise around or up/down the
block).  Then take it to a school parking lot on a non-school day
(Sunday mid-morning often works well) and doing maneuvering exercises
(slaloms and so on).  Finally, try steadily-longer-range trips.  It
may or may not be helpful to have a chase vehicle on some of these, or
at least a cell phone, so that you know that if something happens you
won't be stranded.

Good luck.
