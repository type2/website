There is also baumtools_dot_com, with a vw-266 for a whopping 39 bucks. I
have one, very well made and sturdy. Used it twice, like a dream. I will
only use my pickle fork for paint cans and burglars now.

Tie rod puller. It's like a gear puller. Alot of parts houses have them
for rent or even for free. I have done it with a C-clamp, but your
curseword vocabulary has to be up to snuff, although you can use the
same couple of words over and over with changes in volume.

&gt; Subject line pretty much sez it all!!!!
&gt;
&gt; The ones on the driver's side came off just fine.  However the one on
&gt; the passenger side (the one that was bad) wont budge.  Ive beat on it,

&gt; shot it full of WD40 and I even used nasty words.  Still no luck.
&gt;
&gt; Ideas????
&gt;
&gt; Thanks in advance!!
