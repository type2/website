Subject: Hazet Torister kits FS on ebay + Roundbox tools (LONG!)
Mime-Version: 1.0
X-MIME-Autoconverted: from quoted-printable to 8bit by lenti.type2_dot_com id HAA11669

(Let me start by saying i have no financial interest in the following)

Maybe it is just me but there seem to be a lot of hazet touri$ter toolkits
(the round kit that fits inside the rim of your spare tire) for sale on eaby.
None of them are rock bottom prices but for those witht the $ there is lots to
choose from ( 3 kits when i last checked)

For the non purists the ~$130.00 roundbox (roundboxtools_dot_com) toolkit may look
a lot more appealing.

I ordered one form them (roundbox tools) and was very pleased with the
professionallism of their dealings. I wouold recommend them whole-heartedly.
Apparently thesy are no going to be making any more of these ktis so once they
are gone they are gone.

One note the tools in the repro kit are strictly for decorative puposes (look
like they would break trying to pullout a staple), these are made in
India/China tools, they ain't no Hazets! As well the layout of the tools (as
compared to the originals) is incorrect and incomplete. But it is pretty durn
close when you factor in that the original kits are going for about 5 times
what they are charging. The outer case on the repop tools kit is very well
made though and just about bang on!

my $0.02

If you want to see what an original and complete toolkit would have looked
like check out
