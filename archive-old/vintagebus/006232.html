Subject: NQ's T4 on a budget - 2L parts.

I had a request from a listee to put a more consistant subject on all my
posts related to the T4 project as it will make it easier to find the info
in the archives.  What a brilliant idea! :-)

Got a message from Joe _at_ Oregon performance just a minute ago.  He confirmed
what I had thought that with a 1.8L Porsche 914 engine, all you need to
convert it to a 2L is the crank, rods, and P/C's.  Whew - I thought I was
going to have to buy another engine.  I found RMMW has 10/10 T4 cranks for
$166 but they are currently out of stock.  I'm gonna check with Ronnie as
well to see what kind of goodies he has.  I wanted to go junkyarding today
and grab a bus 2L engine that I know of but with that all in mind, I might
not have to.  It might be better to outsource the parts needed instead of
hoping some local shop can do the regrind work for me.  Probably would cost
more and defeat the budget aspect.

My brother bought this T4 1.8L engine and trans for $50 and the nice brother
that he is, offered to sell it to me for $100.  I think I'll buy it and sell
the trans for spite. :-) :-)

Anyway, got things to do...
