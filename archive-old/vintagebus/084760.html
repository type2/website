From the tunacan site.  http://www.tunacan_dot_net/t4/tech/cr.htm

Compression plays a large factor in the resulting combustion chamber 
temperature. A really low compression ratio, like 7.0:1 for a Type 4 
engine, will generate less heat in the combustion chamber and accordingly 
in the head and oil. Other factors also determine how much heat is 
produced, but with everything else being identical, the higher the 
compression ratio, the higher the resulting temperature at the head.

Less CR in a hi load, long trip bus(DC) would be good.

good luck Tom!


Cheers, dave

&gt; I am the one who posted the 9.1 c. ratio &amp; you are exactly right in

&gt; obsessive comp. Gene Berg protigi, bug racing motor guy.
&gt; 
&gt; My criteria to him for this bus engine was &quot;BOMBPROOF&quot; engine for long road
&gt; trips to shows, etc.  It runs well around town &amp; has great torque on
&gt; hills-can go over 7000 ft elev. passes in 4th gear which I was in 2nd or 2rd
&gt; on before, but does get to 230 + when driving over 55 mph for over 15-20
&gt; minutes in warm, dry weather. I have 6000 miles on the engine ($2800) &amp; need
&gt; for it to last.
&gt; 
&gt; But I am questioning the wisdom of this engine in a DC w/ tilt  &amp; roof rack
&gt; also!
