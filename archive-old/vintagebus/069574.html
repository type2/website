Subject: tranny/redux update (longish)

Finally got the nosecone bush issue resolved. Ronnie made the simple
suggestion to cut a sleeve from a beer can to shim up the outer
seal-carrier bush, and that worked like a charm.  Added a little sealant
around that.  Still a little baffled by that - w/o a caliper I couldn't
measure the diff exactly, but the new bushes (plain and seal-carrier) both
appeared to be about 1mm smaller OD than the old one.

But it's in now, with RTV-painted gasket and nylocks on the nosecone.
Loosely attached the rear bracket with new mounts and put the front mount
and new ground strap on.

Tonite I put the axles/FPs/side gears in (swapped sides to wear in the
other direction) and got the thrust washers and snap rings in, making sure
the gears meshed up.  Twist one axle, the other turns the other way:
seems right. :)

Offered up the tubes &amp; played with shims.  Three appears to be right --
with 2, it seems to bind and with 4 it flops around.  Checked this dry
with nuts torqued to 14ft-lbs.  Tomorrow night I'll finger-paint shims
with RTV per E&amp;B and get everything torqued down.

Next step appears to be to tap in the upper inner bearings and the lower
axle shaft, then crank down the 41mm nut with some loctite on it.  Also
per E&amp;B I ground two extra notches on the lower axle to have multiple
staking points for the nut.  Then plugs with RTV and paint the backs of
the plugs.

At that point I'll go ahead and horse the Klingon bird of prey back into
position and get the bolts started, make sure everything's about right and
snug them down.  Outer bearings etc. then seal the redux boxes up.  From
there I'm back on familiar turf.

PS: Much thanks to Ronnie for investigating the nosecone bush issue.  I
will donate my spare plain bush as a door prize at the Lovebug campout. :)
