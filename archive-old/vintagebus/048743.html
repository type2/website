Subject: engine won't start-up

Got the '59 Kombi 1600cc DP engine that I just overhauled back in and 
all hooked up. Got everything real good. Took my time. turned over 
the engine with the coil plug pulled to build up oil pressure. hooked 
it back up.

The engine wouldn't fire-up for nothin'!!! I did all the tests. 
Checked I was getting fuel. Did the disty checks. Same with coil. 
Closest thing I could figure is maybe the coil ain't cuttin' it. I've 
never really done the test before, but the little spark I get from it 
is pretty much orange in the middle with a little bit of blue at the 
edge. Do you think this might keep the engine from starting up? It 
turns real good. I was all ready to let it run for 20 minutes will I 
celebrated with a beer. No start...no beer. So I'm grumpy right now.

I might swap the coil with the one on my wife's bug tommarrow and see 
if it helps. Don't really know what else to check.
