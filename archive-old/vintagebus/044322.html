Subject: Eric &amp; Barb's roof rack clamp trick...

While I was out at our local crazy guy's vw yard grabbing a fender 
for my wife's 'vert (yeh..me too ronnie!!!) I saw one of the bug gas 
tank retainers laying on the ground. I remembered how Eric &amp; Barb 
reccommended using them as a replacement for a missing westy wood 
slat roof rack clamp. My rack is missing exactly on clamp...so I 
snatched it up. I can't tell you how amazed I was when I fit it to 
the rack. This little guy works PERFECT!!! I highly reccommend anyone 
out there that's missing a clamp to grab one of this cheap little 
boogers up. You can probably find one in your junk stash or get one 
for free from a vw person. They fit and work perfect...and even look 
like they were made for the purpose. Pretty darn neat.
