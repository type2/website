Speaking of safaris... I picked up a set from Izz at Kelley Park (w/ a free t-shirt;c).
 Question is what do you use for sealing the rubber to the frame?  Roof tar?
 Silicone?  Anyone install Izz's windows have any undocumented tips?  I'm gonna
try and put them in this weekend so any advice would be great.
