So that's correct.    There are no holes in the plates?  If I remember
correctly, they are at 4 and 6 maybe?  Are there little finger plugs covering
up the holes?  If not, you can always revert to removing the drum, but you
probably already knew that.  I had to do that, because I could get the stars
to budge.  When I took the drum off, it was suddenly obvious why my brakes
weren't working.  The wheel cylinder had blown apart.  So I dismantled the
whole back brake, degreased it and repainted, repaired and/or replaced just
about everything back there.  They worked great for the next few days, then
I took my Crew off the road to rebuild the engine - which I am still doing.

Paul
66 Crew - great brakes and no engine (all stop, no go?)
