&lt;&lt; PS I guess the moral is: Carry a fire extinguisher, and all the insurance 
you 
  can afford. &gt;&gt;
 
 Or another moral is: always drive your bus so you know it is safe with you 
at all times. &gt;&gt;

But I can't drive all my busses at once.  I was driving the doublecab next to 
the camper when the accident occurred.
