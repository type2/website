One way to flatten them out is to get them nice and wet with a sponge or
something, then put them between two pieces of plywood, or  weigh them down
with a bunch of phone books on a flat floor.

When dry they should be pretty flat.

Then there are a million ways to keep them flat...
por-15 on the back I heard works pretty well, although the majority of listees
probably use a plastic liner between the panel and the door, making sure that
the door can drain properly, Eric and Barb probably have some solution with
tar...good luck.
