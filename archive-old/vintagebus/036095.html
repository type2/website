&lt;&lt; With all these complaints, is anyone going to talk to the GG chapter and 
 maybe help them make some changes for the future? Tell them how 
disappointing 
 it was?  &gt;&gt;

After Kelley Park, Taylor Nelson forwarded comments made by list members to 
the GG chapter (After editing out our names and addresses). They were 
actually published in their chapter newsletter. Whether or not our input will 
be acted on is another story.
