 Rex-
 I adjust my brakes so they JUST touch a hair.
 More brakes is better. The pedal will be higher.
 Adjust the brake so the drum won't turn, then
 back off until the drum turns freely. a slight scraping
 will more than likely go away when the brakes are applied
 and the shoes settle in.

Ya, me too.  And if I put new shoes on I adjust them again soon.    As the 
new shoes will wear into a circle.  You can feel them not being the same 
circle as the drum.  And if you take the drum off in a hundred miles you can 
see the wear pattern on the shoe, where patches are contacting the drum and 
patches aren't.  Like I put new shoes on the back of my 61, and the braking 
almost pulsed, it was odd.  It was new drums too.  But shortly broke in.     
So each time you adjust the shoes, it cganges the shoe geometry, right?  as 
the side of the shoe at the cylinder keeps the same motion, but the side at 
the adjusted is pushed towards the drums.  But then when you stomp the brakes 
the shoe will reset.  Like it can shift along the axis up and down, you know, 
sometime you have to tap it to center when you put the drum on as the drum 
will catch on the shoes?  So shoes will shift like that to re center itself 
after adjusting.   Then they have new geometery (very slightly) on each end.

As I can't post with out mentioning grease, It is much easier to adjust 
brakes if the stars adjusters had been greased (threads, and where the star 
piece turns in the backing plate. 

Okay, that was the longest I had put a coherent (?) thought together about 
brake shoes.
