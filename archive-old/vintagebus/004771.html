 Anyone need split front door glass? have tons of small serkit? glass and
will bring if anyone wants. To heavy to haul it all for no takers.

 Also installed the Aircooled_dot_com vacuum advance 009 dist. that was in VW
Trends today. Been setting on the bench for a couple of weeks. Talked to the
Aircooled_dot_com guys at BOR and learned a few things. They say 3 to 4 MPG gain
off the bat. Got 20.4 to and from Phoenix with full load and single wheel
trailor running 60 MPH +-. Will check MPG to and from KP and see what I get.
Will report back. It this thing works it will pay for itself in 1 or 2
trips. 1st trip around the block was great, lost the 009 flat spot off idle
and seemed to pull better up the hill. The KP trip will tell. If works will
have Thom install one to save on gas for VW Classic.

 See you at red barn Fri night.

 John Howard
