&lt;&lt; anyone have any suggestions for remving a steering lock from the steering
 column? the key has long since been lost and apears to be in the &quot;locked&quot;
 position :P
 
 i have taken the side plate off via the two slotted screws but that hasn't
 gotten me a whole lot further

  &gt;&gt;
what year is the bus?  does the lock have the Fahrt start writing on it?  You 
could also take your bus to the locksmith (or get a house call) to have a key 
made
