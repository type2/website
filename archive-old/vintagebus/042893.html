Put about 1200 miles on the '57 bus this weekend, and I'd have to say that
it was pretty successful.  The girlfriend and I left friday morning and
got to Boise friday evening and went camping at &quot;Westys in the Woods&quot; put
on by the Bus Pilots Association.  Since it was the beginning of the
weekend, there weren't many busses out &quot;in the woods&quot; yet, so my bus was
one of two splittys.  It was a load of fun!  to get to the campsite, we
had to drive many, many miles on bumpy dirt roads.  I had to stop a couple
times to put my aircleaner back on!  After the camping trip we cruised
down to twin falls for a wedding, then back to Boise.  Anyway, the bus was
running pretty hot almost the whole time, and noticably hotter after the
camping trip.  I think it sucked some dust.  Anyway, I don't think it will
survive in Calif. so I'm not taking it down.  But I'll be there with the
Bus Pilots!  See ya in California!!!
