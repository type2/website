Hi Kevin,
Yes you can!  You need to measure with a straight edge the distance from the 
forward end of the pressure plate and the forward surface of the engine case 
where it mates to the tranny.  Then using the same tools measure the rear of 
the bell housing  surface where the engine case mates up to the rear of the 
clutch throw out bearing nearest to the fork that holds it is best.  What you 
want is the measurement of the tranny to be 1/8&quot; (4mm) longer than the 
measurement of the engine/clutch measurement.  This at worse results in a 
clutch cable needing to be adjusted a turn or two!  Not the five to fifteen 
minute adjusting and checking back and forth, up and down!
