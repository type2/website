OK, Not saying my 56 is the same as youre 59, hey, Mines even got differences 
int he hatch itself.
On my 56, 
Here is the order from outside, in.
Hatch, Hatch hinge, Rubber seal (This is the same rubber as used in bus walk 
through sections, and on my cargo floor mat in my westy, its thick, and has 
grooves/texture in it), Then the roof/sheet metal, then through the wood 
blocks and the headliner panel, then a thick aluminum? washer, and the 
bolt/cap.
Hope that helps, I dissasembled mine on Sunday.

Like most things on my bus, the subhatch had been dismantled by the time I 
took ownership of it.  Thus, no record of how it is supposed to be mounted.

I have the new veneer panel, both hold downs and the prop installed.  What I 
don't know is what washers, grommets, spacers, etc. go on both the exterior 
roof side and interior side of the 4 hinge bolt studs.  Can any subhatch 
Westy owner out there give me a detailed description of the EXACT order of 
what goes when and where when mounting the hatch?  This would probably only 
be feasible if you've disassembled your hatch fairly recently.  For some 
reason I remember reading a post by someone a few months  ago that lead me to 
believe there are more metal and rubber washers up there than one would 
expect.

As always, TIA!
