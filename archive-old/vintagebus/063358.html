&gt;On a whim, I called Auto Zone and asked them if they could get me a
&gt;carb for my 71 VW bus. They said &quot;Yes, there are 2 to choose from, One
&gt;from Champion for $149.99 or a Federal Carb for $110.99

I guess I was wrong about &quot;Federal&quot;, it really was a brand name in
this case.

AutoZone and O'Reilly both have their parts looker-uppers online now,
so you can get price and availabilitty over the Web.

&gt;Cost: $110.99, Thank you Autozone.

Did they charge you the $45 core?

&gt;I'll let all you &quot;009 Dizzy Sucks&quot; guys know if I become a believer
&gt;or not ;^)

I don't know.  I do know that the 009 works a lot better on my engine
than the Porsche 356 distributor that was on it when I got it.  :)
