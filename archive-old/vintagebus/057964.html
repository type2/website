Subject: Re: [VB] leaking crew cab

Along these same lines, the PO or PPO (the only other owners) at one time
removed the oak slats but for better or worse leaded not only all the holes
closed but did the bed seams too.  For now I think I'll just leave it as I
think it contributed to this trucks dryness.  But I'll eventually put slats
back on it and was wondering how the best way to remove the stuff?  Torch
and scrape/wire brush?

&gt; installed a repro set of bedslats,
