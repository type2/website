Hi Fred,

Again, thank you for publicizing our trip.  Our membership grew from 63 to
87 thanks to you.  Needless to say, we were thrilled when we checked the
site today.


&gt;I'm amazed by your speed of response.  There are several Type 2 driving
&gt;families roaming the western USA right now, and they are having a hard time
&gt;finding 'net access to post reports.  When they do find a connection
&gt;[usually in a library], the connection is so slow they give up in
&gt;frustration.  The best arrangement seems to be Pocketmail.
We are carrying a laptop with us and are able to type our emails, save them
on a disk and cut and paste into hotmail at  the internet cafe, which makes
things quicker.  In addition we found that, in general, internet cafes are
very good and inexpensive.  For instance, we are paying 2 soles (60 cents)
for an hour which is typical throughout Latin America.

&gt;A couple more questions about Jova...

&gt;When you converted to a 1600, did you install the &quot;European&quot; tin that goes
&gt;with it in a late bay bus?
I had a mechanic install the engine and he made the tin himself.  It is a
little tricky and he did a good job.

&gt;You haven't mentioned any heating problems, so I assume you have some sort
of engine compartment sealing arrangement. And, guessing again, I assume the
1600 is a dual port?

We used the standard seal around the tin he created and have had no
overheating problems.  It is a single port motor.

&gt;The stock transaxle in your bus has substantially higher gearing to take
&gt;advantage of the extra power of the 2000 engine.  When I read of your
&gt;difficulties climbing the grades in Mexico It occurred to me you might be
&gt;running a late bay transaxle.  That alone would account for your
&gt;hill-climbing difficulties.
I agree.  Unfortunately, there is not much we can do now so we will stick
with it.

&gt;What type of distributor are you running? I hope it's a stock vacuum
advance unit. They make an enormous difference in the bus's ability to start
from rest and pull up steep grades. The ubiquitous &quot;009&quot; distributor is
totally unsuited for a transporter/bus in &quot;normal&quot; circumstances, let alone
the rigorous conditions you are encountering. If you are running an 009, you
need to rev the engine up and slip the clutch to get going on a grade and
that's not conducive to long clutch life. I speak from long and painful
experience driving a Westfalia in the mountains of the Pacific Northwest...

Hum, I did not know this.  Yes, we have the 009 and I wonder if it would
help to change it out.

&gt;&gt;Last nosy question... do you have actual internet access where you can
&gt;download websites, or just e-mail access? One of the reasons I ask is that
&gt;right now a South African member of the VintageBus List is departing on an
&gt;expedition to drive from the S. tip of Africa to its Northernmost point. It
&gt;might be interesting for you to exchange notes via your respective
websites.

&gt;And its too late now, but are you aware that VW has published a
&quot;supplement&quot;
&gt;about modifications and preparations for &quot;difficult journeys&quot;? It's
&gt;available online.
Yes, we have internet access and we plan to ship the van from Buenos Aires
to Durban, South Africa sometime in early 2002 and we would love to
communicate with the South African vintage bus list member.  We are a bit
concerned about the route through Northeastern Africa and would greatly
appreciate help there.

If you have any other information that could help us, or if you have any
other questions we look forward to hearing from you.

Take care,

Rich and Amanda Ligato
