&gt;Then the rain came, six volt wipers in heavy rain, manually turning 
&gt;them on and off not to burn the motor out, for the next hundred miles
&gt;wasn't fun (time to install the volt-a-drop), then the winds came, so
&gt;besides working the wipers I had to fight the headwinds.

Per Bentley the 6v wiper motor draws 20 watts.  It occurs to me
that this is a decent match for both filaments of a 6v tail-light
bulb in parallel (1154, 16.8W + 5.3W = 22.1W) or just use the
bright filament to get a little more speed out of the motor
without hitting it with the full 12v.  What I'm trying to say is
that a tail light wired in-line in the wiper motor hot lead might
be a good field expedient replacement for a volt-a-drop.  The
bulb will light up and get warm, though, so you will want to
put it where it won't glare on the windshield or ignite anything.

My '64 is still 6v so I work on minimizing voltage drops rather
than adding them.  :)
