 I've got a 1.5 mile dirt road/driveway, and it wreaks havoc on my engine
 compartment.
  &gt;&gt;

I would'nt use extra covers to keep dust out.  They'll clog and keep air out 
too.

I would go get some simple green, liberally squirt it on you engine 
compartment, under neath, and be careful to squirt it from underneath around the push 
rod tubes and everywhere you can get to on the fins .  Let it soak in a while

then go to a self serve car wash and pressure wash it off.  Make sure you get 
the push rod tube and fin areas underneath.  It's a funny angle.  Wear your 
cruddy clothes, as the grit gets kicked back.   This should give you a nice 
clean degreased engine compartment and engine.  If the engine is not oily, the 
dust shoud not stick to it.

Now just check your oil bath (bong action) air cleaner every tune up, and 
change its oil.  use thin oil.  If you have a paper filter, chuck it and use the 
oil bath.   This should work fine.  VW said if you drive in dusty conditions 
check the oil every 600 miles.  You could do this, and see what happens.  I 
have found oil baths with a half inch of crud at the bottom,  don't know how the 
engine ran though.

If you are still worried, find a heavy duty (cyclone) air filter at a swap.  
I think the ones out of things were almost the same.   Or think of investing 
in gravel at some point.
