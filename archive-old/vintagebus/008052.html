The bus towbar made by Dr. Joe is as narrow as it is so it will work on both
bays and splits. That is also why it has the spacers for the beam. The
narrow design also makes it more convenient to carry and it is adequate for
towing a bus. It is lightweight, and works respectably well. The fingers
could be thicker, but the main problem is that the bolts he supplies are too
long in the shank portion. The nut won't tighten down tight on the fingers.
This is the only problem I have seen. The muffler clamps when installed
tightly work well to prevent sliding, but the fingers will spread if the
bolts are not tight. We saw this on the tow to the Classic, the winds were
heavy and we were travelling fast. I had the limo towing the ABC raffle bus
and Joe had his bus behind the Chevy. His bus would take off in a crosswind
or when a truck passed and it would yank over 7000 lbs. of Chevy van and
passengers all over the road. Turns out the fingers had spread by the half
inch or so allowed by the unthreaded portion of the bolt leaving a very
sloppy connection to the bus. The solution, after we beat the fingers
straight again, was to pile washers on the bolts and crank them down. He
said it towed like a dream on the way home at 75 mph. Same winds and truck
traffic. First time we tried that bar at speed, and after realizing what the
problem was, it worked well. I tow at speeds in excess of that all the time
with the limo, but my bar is considerably stronger, wider, and shorter. It
is designed to pull a bus as a trailer with the steer tires removed should
the front end be hammered, or something. It weighs a ton, and is a major
pain to transport unless it actually has a bus attached to it, so while it
is good for what I am doing with it, there aren't many people that have that
need. If you haul a lot of buses, you probably made your own, and most other
folks would be more than well served by one of the Dr. Joe bars. The
problems with the bar are easily fixed, and for occasional use a heavier and
larger bar would suck.

&gt; .... I can see how there might need to be some reinforcement added on
&gt; around the little fingers that slide up on the beam but I really like my
&gt; towbar and haven't had any of the problems
&gt; that have been mentioned....
&gt;
&gt; Welding on a gusset to these fingers would sure help. Also, drilling new
&gt; holes to mount the keeper pin/bolt closer to the tube would reduce the
&gt; amount of leverage applied to the fingers by some degree. I've used my
&gt; towbar off and on for about a year and I see no signs of the fingers
&gt; bending. Using the spacer for the required beam diameter may be a factor
&gt; also.
