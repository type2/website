Subject: Custom Vehical Regs

Any one know exactly what the custom vehical regs say for the state of
Florida? I am thinking about doing a custom job out of a older VW that
is not long for this world other wise, and I want to know exactly what
equipment it needs to have on it to be street legal.. I know some states
you need a windshield where as other you just need windshield squirter,
and as it will probly be registered in this state it would be nice to
know exactly what I have to comply with and see if its worth the effort
to do it.. or even a general idea of what is required in most states..
and will it depend on the year of the frame I start with? IE if I used a
say 62 that didnt hae belts originaly would I have to put them in, that
sort of thing..


TIA
