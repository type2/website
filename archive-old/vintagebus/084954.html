Subject: Re: [VB] wiper arm recall

Hi John -
 As I previously noted to the list, VW has discontinued providing this style
of wiper arm, in fact several years ago. I have some inquiries into Europe
for any old stocks laying around, but have turned up zilch so far. I will
keep looking.
 There was a Brazilian variety available up until last year, but that was
discontinued as well.
 VW PN is 221 955 407 A Note - the original style arm as well as the
&quot;recall&quot; arm has the same part number - VW never superseded it, which is the
exception, rather than the rule.

&gt; After reading the post on the wiper arm recall I'm
&gt; looking to replace the wiper arms on my 67 Westy. I
&gt; would like to put the style arms on that clamp on to
&gt; the shaft with a bolt instead of the set screw style.
&gt; Does any one know where to get this style wiper arm?
&gt; I've seen a reference to Jeep but nothing specific.
&gt; I'm not concerned with stock original stuff. This is
&gt; my only vehicle, a daily driver. Thanks for the help.
