Subject: Re: [VB] What the son said [67 rebuild - cracked case]

Like others said, don't worry why the case cracked.    

But you are getting a replacement case, not a 'fixed' case, right?   did you 
write down the old ,cracked, case number?   So you know you get another, ya?

&lt;&lt; I called to see how the progress was going on the bus .. The father wasn't
 there, but one of the sons answered.
 I said &quot;have you figured out what caused the case to crack.&quot;  He said .. 
&quot;that
 the motor flexing.&quot;  I said &quot;huh ?? what does that mean ..&quot;  and he stumbled
 around for words and basically said &quot;we are fixing it with a brace.&quot;  Anyone
 have any idea what he is saying or what it means ?? I will drill the owner
 better if I know what I am supposed to ask.
