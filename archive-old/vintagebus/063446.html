&gt;[the Bentley] is exactly the book that I am using to rebuild my tranny.

OK.  I assumed you were asking &quot;out of the blue&quot; and didn't have a book.

You might want to look at the Without Guesswork books at the doc
project http://wow.atlasta_dot_net/~mriluvu/oacdp/ .  The '69 version
has the picture with the r-number as in Bentley, while the '72 version
mentions that the r-numbers weren't marked on the gears starting in
January 1972 - look at page 80 and following of the '72 book.  The
direction is to &quot;determine &quot;actual&quot; measurements before repair&quot; which
to me implies that you have to measure the gears while they're in
the original transmission before you take it apart.  I don't know if
this is the only way to do it, though.
