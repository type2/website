Subject: [VB] Bumper puzzle

Hi -

Could someone explain to me why these bumpers are different.  

This link:
http://www.thesamba_dot_com/vw/classifieds/pix/207711.jpg

Shows the end of the bumpers ( i.e in front by dogleg and in rear corner ) as having this sort of upward point

While this link:
http://www.thesamba_dot_com/vw/classifieds/pix/210880.jpg

Shows the point equidistant from ground and sky.

I hope someone gets my drift.  Anyhow, I have the first kind ( in the front ) and want to find a matching rear bumper,
what am I missing?? I thought all 59-67 bumpers were the same.  If I order a rear bumper from say WW which one will I get?

Thanks in advance.

rob
