&lt;&lt; Can anyone give me a couple ideas on which way to go, i was planning to 
put a stock bus muffler and pipe on it.  &gt;&gt;
Unless you are going to do drag racing RPMs with that sized engine then stock 
muffler will do just fine by keeping the engine cooler and better MPG.  Plus 
keep you from monoxiding you and your passengers to death.  Eric&amp;Barb
