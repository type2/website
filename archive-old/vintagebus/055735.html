I'm looking at my '79 vintage Idiots book (Muir), It has a Bug including the
emblem.  Wonder if the newest ones have the emblem?  Certainly times have
changed!

I don't buy the &quot;clear the decks the real stuff is coming&quot; either. They seem
to be trying to eliminate so much non parts stuff. I saw a poster with a
DRAWING of a beetle and the word &quot;Bug&quot; on it as part if the artistic design.
They got nailed. Vendors that have removed artistic designs that have
included a VW symbol have been hit. And my favorite is the blacked out VW
emblem on a bus in VW Trends magazine. That's incredible.
