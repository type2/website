&gt; &gt; That said I'll put a plug in for Wilsons 'how to rebuild book'
&gt; &gt; I've got Bentley, Muir,Clymer and Haynes and at rebuild time it
&gt; Sold my Bentley, kept my Hayes and bought the Tom Wilson book.
&gt; I wouldn't mind having a Bentley that just covers the 80-83 Air Cooled
&gt; but my Bentley covered 80-91 Air and Water Cooled and I sold it to a
&gt; Waser Boxer owner, bless his soul, who needed it a lot more than me.
&gt; Just flipping through that giant book was often more work than the minor
&gt; repair was attacking.
&gt; Lets get Jake Rabe to write a book on the engines types 1 thought 4 so
&gt; we'll know the truth.
