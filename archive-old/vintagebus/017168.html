The vehicle that I'm trying to get rid of is a 1963 singlecab. It is located
in Michigan and therefore is not in the best of shape, but the body is in
fair condition, it needs a little straightening and some paint. The rocker
on the passenger side is going and the wheel arch on the front drivers side
is pretty much gone. The motor runs but needs some work (1600 singleport)
and I haven't even tried to start it in several months. It has new kingpins,
a new gas tank, new fuel pump smaller reduction gears, EMPI lockout shifter,
and a rebuilt speedo. The interior is actually in great shape although the
dash does need a little work. The VIN# as appears on the title is 1092910,
but I will look at the plate behind the seat just to verify the next time I
am out at my storage lot. The title # (titled in Michigan) is 299K1090069 T.
As far as who to contact, I can be reached at BZWACKER_at_HOME.COM, or my home
phone at (248)656-1432 my name is Brian Zawacki
Thanks for your help and if there is anything else that you need just let me
know.

Thom
