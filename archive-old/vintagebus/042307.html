&gt; HOW DO I NOW WHAT SIZE THE FLYWHEEL ON MY 66 MICROBUS IS?
&gt; 

Assuming a stock transmission and engine, without the optional 12v
available that year, you should have a 200mm 6v flywheel.

If you have a 12v-original bus, you would have a 200mm 12v flywheel.

So, you have a 200 flywheel, assuming it is still original.


Of course, someone may have put a (assuming you have a 6v bus..) 180mm 6v
flywheel on at some point......Your best bet is going to be to pull the
engine and find out, unfortunetly.  Or order both clutch sets, and send
one back.;) (find a local parts house who would either have them on hand,
or who would be willing to le you do that...)

good luck...david

ps: Its advisable to NOT type in all caps...Its sort of annoying.;)
(unless you have such an old computer...but that is not likely in this day
and age.)
