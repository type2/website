&gt;regarding the poor quality of engine lid to body seals...I ordered one

&gt;year, but the quality seemed so bad, i never installed it.
&gt;Any one know where to get a really good seal? 

A few years ago I did an analysis for NEATO's Old Bus Review on 
the issue of rubber for our buses.  At the time, the list discussions
were
about windshield seals, so I used that as my example.  I ordered
two seals from

Bus Boys
Rocky Mountain Motorworks
Vintage Parts
West Coast Metric

Prices and handling for these two pieces ranged (at that time) from
$30 to $34.  The look, feel and joints of the various seals was
pretty consistent from all vendors.  What stood out in my quasi-
scientific review was the weight of the seals.  Three of the four
vendors' product weighed in at 750 grams (plus or minus).  One
was 33% heavier, at over 1,000 grams.

I put the heavy seals on my '67 Deluxe just based on the 
denser materials.  Haven't had a problem since.  The source
of those seals was Vintage Parts, and that's where I'd go
back to for any other seals in the future.
