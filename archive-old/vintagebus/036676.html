&gt; Apparently there is a 
&gt; push to &quot;put more
&gt; stuff on vw_dot_com that is of interest to all in the VW 
&gt; community&quot;, meaning
&gt; people who own vintage VWs. I hope they really do it.

Here in South Africa there has been a trend in VW advertising over the last
few years to make a connection between the features that made bugs, and to a
lesser dregree buses, attractive ie. economy, reliability, etc.

There are currently three TV ads here featuring 'vintage' VW products of
various types(one is an aeronauticized engine powering an ultr-light) that
are aired here. I have always found it irritating that VW, in South Africa
at least, are quick to hire their immaculately resto'd vintage products to
use in ads but are not nearly as enthusiastic when it comes to maintaining
even the smallest store of parts beyond the level of fan belts and spark
plugs.

I think that taking an attitude more like that of Mercedes Benz would be a
good idea. One can supposedly order virtually any factory part for a post
war Merc from the dealer and it will be supplied(at a price of course). A
mate of mine drives a second owner '54 merc and has never had any parts
hassles(other than price of course) from his local Merc dealer. Not
surprisingly he is a Merc nut and his wife drives a new C200.

I am a vintage VW nut but have absoloutely NO affinity whatever to VW's
current product range. Given the number of Bugs that are driven daily in
South Africa alone, I think that they are missing out on the opportunity to
make a couple thousand more converts to their brand by making it easy to
keep and maintain these rolling billboards that scream relibility,
dependability etc. These vehicles tend to be cycled through families where
college age kids drive them for a bit and when they get a job they pass it
down to the next sibling.

My experience of trying to source VW parts for my bus, and for the bugs of a
couple of friends, is that VW thinks it's a pain in the ass to service this
part of the market. As a result almost every part I have ever bought for an
aircooled VW product has come from a FLAPS or scrapyard.
