The pump has got to be nore accurage than my gauge. The last time I pulled the motor I decided to drain the tank. The gauge read less than 1/4 and I am drained almost 5 gallons out. Quite a flurry to find another gas can as #1 was filling up :)

You can be pretty sure that the pump reading is accurate, as they are usually
calibrated by a weights and measures agency.

Interesting, I'd heard they were up to 10% off...  there was a recent discussion
on the Type 3 list about this, it came about because of a few people putting
11 gallons into their 10 gallon tanks.
