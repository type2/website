77 bus Westfalia camper, popup top, needs engine work. $400 obo
559-322-0931

Now you know as much as I do.

This is a heck of a deal if it is a local bus that spent all its life here.
It would be rust-free. If it has all the camper parts, it's worth more in
pieces. If anyone wants more info, I will go look at it. [if it is still
available, it appeared in the 'too late to classify' section] Wish I had
room in my driveway!!
