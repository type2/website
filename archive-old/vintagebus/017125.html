i just got safari's for my bus (from Wolfsburg West)
and they seem to fit fine. the rubber needs to be cut
to fit. i don't know why they just didn't make them
fit, but i am pretty stupid.

&gt; Hi All.
&gt; 
&gt; I was trying to put together my safaris last night
&gt; and realized that the
&gt; windows I have are complete SH^T (that's all caps
&gt; for a reason!).  The
&gt; corners are all wrong and they are actually too
&gt; narrow...  I'd tell you who
&gt; made them but let's not all go there.
&gt; 
&gt; Anyway, who makes good safari glass for original
&gt; frames that IS the right
&gt; size and shape?  Or, who has that original pair in
&gt; their garage that they're
&gt; willing to part with for a few thousand dollars. ;-)
&gt; 
&gt; Also, I noticed that the rubber seals (WCM) stretch
&gt; quite a bit and I always
&gt; ended up with extra that could not be crammed into
&gt; the rail... even though I
&gt; soaped everything up real good.  How do you do it
&gt; right?  But then again,
&gt; maybe this happened since my glass is the wrong
&gt; size.
