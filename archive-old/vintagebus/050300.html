I've got a set of back-up lights that came off my '66 parts bus. I was
wondering if someone would mine looking at them and telling me if they were
original on this bus or not.

I've also got a 1/4 and 3/4 type front bench seat set. I'm not sure what
year they came out of. Was wondering if someone could check out those
pictures and let me know.

You can see 'em at the bottom of this page:
