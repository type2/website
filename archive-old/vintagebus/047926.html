Subject: Re: [VB] DriversFest VW Show
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

wow, a VW sponsored show kind of makes me a little queesy.  I suppose if we 
skipped both Jamborees this year at $12-$14 each to get into ($25 total for 
both of us) we'd have an extra $50 to afford Driversfest.  Who knows what 
food'll cost though.  Maybe Hot Dog Fred can set up in the parking lot.  He'd 
make a killing.

I just dont know what I'd do there all day.  Maybe make a few trips over to 
the brew pub across the street.  I dont imagine there'll be any sort of swap 
at this show.  VWOA would never allow that.  Maybe it's a chance for the 
Watercooled and Aircooled communities to come together and bond &lt;sob&gt; with 
VWOA and make ammends.

In any event, we'll probably be there.   It looks like they change the 
location of the show every year and I heard it &quot;wasnt bad&quot; last year out in 
NY.  I also want a ride in one of those cup cars.  Hell I want to drive one, 
but that'll never happen.


See ya there

Matt
