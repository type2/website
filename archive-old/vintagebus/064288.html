Subject: Re: [VB] Lowered Bus Question

yea.. um...
the real easy way to change the rear tire on a lowered bus is to .... raise
the bus back to stock height... could work. I always thought that lowering
was for Jap cars and Caddys.

Speaking of stock height, if anyone wants to 'fix' their bus I have a rear
end from a 63 , small nut tranny with RGBs and suspension. $25 come and get
it, Located in Charlotte NC

Later,
Bryan
