Subject: Re: [VB] Score! jealous

    I was one of these lucky guys not to brag. I got my 65 21 window two
weeks ago for $1700 and change I will get the pink slip this Friday once all
the paper work is final. I give this bus a 7  it needs just the two front
outriggers and two pans left and right replaced everything else is in
working order.


Eric :-)



&gt; You know I just got a call about the same sort of thing, a guy in Florida
&gt; just got a 23 window in about the same deal 1000 dollars, he called it a
7/8
&gt; on a scale of 1 to 10, that made me jealous, but I'm glad they are still
out
&gt; there like that.

&gt; I'm a mechanic in southern New York at a small shop, and we do alot of
work
&gt; on air-cooled VW'S because my boss and I love them. Well, anyways. A new
&gt; customer just towed in a 1967 bus today that he just purchased from the
&gt; original owner. It is &quot;rust free&quot; and absolutly georgeous! the right front
&gt; door was hit and besides that 100%. The original owner stated that he
never
&gt; washed it. It was hidden up on blocks for 15 years in a barn in the Bronx.
&gt; Oh! did I mention that it was only 81,000 miles on it! OK all, here is the
&gt; kicker...are you sitting down? They bought it for....$1,000. oh I am soooo
&gt; jealous!!
