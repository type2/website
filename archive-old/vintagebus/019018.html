&gt; &gt;'53 book...
&gt; might
&gt; not want that broadcast to the list since that narrows down who 
&gt; might have
&gt; it.  I didn't want him being emailed just wanted to mention that a 
&gt; '53 only
&gt; book exists for those interested.

several things come to mind here, 
one is the image of blood in the water
(sharks)
the other is that of an inbreeding family
(you might be a redneck if you think that a
family reunion is a great way to meet women- foxworthy)
how about the Latin mass?
the royals in Britain.
a rideable wave on Oahu with out ten surfers fighting for it.
what was it? Melvill? go not softly into that final sleep
rage rage against it.
I remember the flames against SOTO and 
the a yard full of type2's
i remember quotes (not on the list) 
about &quot;guys rapeing each other for parts&quot;
isn't paranoia fun?

&gt; 
&gt; Hey, I'd sell you my '59 book but it's useful for my '60 Truck.-
Everett


that's the spirit!
