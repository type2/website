Subject: Funny Bus Reactions

I have had many &quot;bus&quot; comments, the the most fun I had was from a reaction.
I was driving my '75 &quot;parts chaser&quot; bus when coming up to a stop light, I
noticed in the other lane a Dodge Caravan with a computer printed banner in
the back window that read &quot;I'd rather be a VW bus&quot;.

When I pulled up next to the wanna-be bus, the two teen age girls that were
in the van almost got whip lash when they spotted my bus, they had grins
from ear to ear and I thought their hands would fall off their arms from
waving so hard!

It just proves that there is still another generation coming up that enjoys
the busses as much as the &quot;older generation&quot; does.
