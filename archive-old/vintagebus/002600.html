well, you can try that or simply convert it natural gas. Many cars in Europe
are being converted since natural gas is half the price of gasoline. I'm
wondering how much would such a conversion cost here in the good old USA. I
would be interested.

&gt; Thanks All  Just what I wanted.....some inside info on
&gt; what to look for and what to ask for when getting that
&gt; &quot;New&quot; engine for my bus.....Hey come to think of it no
&gt; one said a word about going electric....with a very
&gt; long extension cord I guess.Electric sounds good but
&gt; my guess is much to much money and short range for
&gt; serious road time.I did read about some guys that were
&gt; using old oil from the fast food places that they
&gt; could get for free out back...to run their Franken-Bus
&gt; creation...I'll look for that link....Thanks
&gt; Again...Mark 67 Deluxe 13 window
