I've posted gleaming messages in the past about Gabriel and
his lick wizardry. The guy is good and has quite the stash
of old NOS Bus keys, ignitions,
&gt;
Lick wizardy?  Woah, I'm getting a visual I don't want
there...  :)

He is a nice guy and I've bought a lot of stuff from him
but I believe some of the more common key blanks are
reproduced.  Let me know if I'm wrong.

I respect anybody who tells me I get the same item cheaper
&gt;from someone else...
