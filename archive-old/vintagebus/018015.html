Do you have the color code text handy?  Did you enter your bus in the
registry, or at least search to see if any other buses had similar codes?

&gt; I just received my birth certificate for my 1959 deluxe and it has &quot;special
&gt; painted&quot; for color with no paint code. Has anyone received a birth
&gt; certificate for a special painted bus that had a paint code shown? Anyone
&gt; know if they have that info in the archives?
&gt; 
&gt; My bus was definitely sealing wax red on the bottom and has the word &quot;grau&quot;
&gt; written in the RH headlight bucket like my other 1959. The only difference I
&gt; can see is the upper color seems to have a lot more gray in the color.
