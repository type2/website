several months ago i ordered a bunch of stuff from bus depot for my bus, i
ordered shift patterns that were on back order and soon forgot about them .
 the other day i recived my shift patterns sent priorty, I would never had
even rememberd about them if they had not arived , I just thought that it
was cool that they got them to me as soon as they could and paid for priorty
mail,
Thanks for a job well done
