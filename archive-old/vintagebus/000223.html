Hi, all kind and knowledgeble listees:
     I got several questions with my 66 westy.  Hope you can help.
1. Does SO42 come with ac/dc converter?  If yes, where is it?
2. Is there any original metal roof rack around?  I've seen some in sales 
lits and I   
    wonder where are they from.
3. Does anybody know the source of SO42's cabinet handles?
4. Can anybody tell me how to adjust idle speed of 30 pict 3?
    Thank you.
Michael
