Folks,

What to do with the AIRS site is totally up to Charlie and Wade.

--It *is* possible to scrape email addresses from the AIRS map site. If you
put your address in there spammers might get hold of it. Wade will probably
remove your email address if you ask him to. Personally I think it is worth
the risk and my address is in there but you have to make your own decision.

--Even if we were to password the AIRS site and limit access to listees
(which would be difficult and high-maintenance, but possible) you need to
understand that 1600 people or so will STILL have access to any information
you allow to be published. Among any group of 1600 people, some are
probably wierdos. If you are squeamish about having your address/phone
number on the web where people can see it, you should not be in the AIRS
map IMO whether it is passworded or not.

--Discussions about the nature of human altruism are interesting and all,
but they are off-topic: at issue is whether the AIRS site should be public
or limited to listees. (Imagine you are on the road for two months. You can
probably find ways to get to the web but I wonder whether you can be sure
you are still subscribed to the list/still in the AIRS &quot;permitted list&quot;.
Email addresses get unsubscribed all the time because of network wrinkles.
Ask me how I know. =^ )

&gt;intended as a goodwill gesture totally.
&gt;
&gt;I think some people's worries about the site being public are well-founded.
&gt;I would hate to know that some leech was pulling names and selling them to
&gt;spam generators and such.  I would almost be tempted to find that person and
&gt;practice the good old southern religious move of &quot;laying on of hands&quot;.
&gt;
&gt;I would love to see AIRS stay public and free, but as it grows it's going to
&gt;be much more difficult to do that, and protect the names of the people that
&gt;are legitimately registered on the site.  Wade and I spoke about this when
&gt;we first created the site, but we may have to reconsider and change some
&gt;amount of direction.
&gt;
&gt;Please be patient with us, and give input into how we may resolve this
&gt;issue.  As always, I am at your service, just rather quiet these days.  I
&gt;said so much for two years I have very little to offer anymore.
&gt;
