i was wondering what the pros and cons are of rebuilt engines and new ones 
from mexico. i talked to a mechanic today who said that the rebuilds he gets 
are garrenteed for 12 months or 12,000 miles. he said that new ones are only 
a few hundred dollars more? i just assumed the new ones were the better 
option? any advice? experiences?
