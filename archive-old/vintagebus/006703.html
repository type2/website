Is the coil you have internal ballast resister? or external???
if you do not have the ballast resister you will prematurly burn out points
and/or condenser. The Bosche blue coil being sold by most retailers are not
internally ballast resisted. The Original Blue coils are (but availability
is spotty and the prices are rising) buy them while you can!!!!! The new
Bosche (so called blue coil) are now silver with a large Blue decal these
are internal resisted and are fair priced but do not come with the coil
bracket.

Subject: [VB] My Bus Eats Points


Hey all,

I adjusted my valves sundays and put in a new set of points 2 days ago as 
well as set my timing.  Yesterday bus ran like a champ with the absence of 
brakes like usual.  About 8th of a mile from my house I ran out of gas on 
the top of a hill and rolled backwards a 100 yards or so parked and got gas.

  I kept my accessory lights on for the coast backwards.  I have been real 
careful not to use the accessory due to past experiences with frying points.

  Do you think that short of a time is exceptible to fry a brand new set of 
point.  Due I have a super hot coil?  Any ideas?

Thanks,

Eric
