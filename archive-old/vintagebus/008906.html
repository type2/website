&gt; How about N for Nova Scotia??
&gt;
&gt;


Yeah - maybe, but I thought the second letter referred to the &quot;port&quot; of
entry - Nova Scotia is, as I'm sure you know, a province, and a province has
many ports of entry, in Nova Scotia (Canada's Ocean Playground) there would
by Halifax, Dartmouth, Glace Bay?, Lunenburg? Sydney?.  Also, so I've heard,
the code KM refers to Kanada, Montreal - if that's true - it seems odd that
vw would use Country, City in the case of KM and Country, Province in the
case of KN.   Also there as a major Kanadian port at St. John's
Newfoundland - so would KN (if it were Country, Province) be Kanada,
Newfoundland or Kanada, Nova Scotia?
