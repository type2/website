Subject: [VB] How to mask for 2 tone paint
Message-ID: &lt;383C94EB.D030C1EF_at_dolphinsci_dot_com&gt;

I'm getting closer to being able to put the paint on the double cab and
am looking to find out the best procedure for masking the two paints.
Upper half will be the original light gray and lower half will be L337
blue-gray.

the dividing line will be at the lower edge of the rib that runs the
length of the truck and makes the distinctive splitty front end.

Do I mask off the bottom, paint the top and then reverse?

paint the top, then mask it off and paint the bottom not worrying about
the over spray?

How long should I wait before I put masking tape on fresh paint?

Any other comments or suggestions?

Thanks,

Scott
