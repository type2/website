Subject: Insulation, Noise, and Rust-Proofing

All,

This discussion on insulation reminds me of a site on the web the goes into 
great detail about how to insulate and noise-proof a bus:

http://www.bulley-hewlett_dot_com/VWindex/intrir1.html

One of the procedures this site recommends is coating the interior of the 
bus with a product called Kool-Patch to help prevent rust resulting from 
moisture buildup in insulation.  Are there any opinions on this process?  I 
am a bit leary of it, thinking that rather than protecting myself against 
rust, I would just be making any future restoration nearly impossible.
