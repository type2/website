  I use Castrol Racing 20/50 year round. It's 116 degrees here now and it
cools off to around 90 at night. Just drove the round trip to OCTO/Classic
last weekend. Around 800 miles I guess. Changed oil before trip and
yesterday after getting home. Have 35mm fan, type 4 cooler, filter oil pump,
1776, pict 34, no gauges what so ever. I thank the key with any oil is to
change it often or before and after each trip.
