Dave,

I guess you got some great lessons from VW in them shutting down fan web
sites because of whatever reasons they think it was a good move.  I always
wondered if there were people who SUPPORTED such things based on twisted
logic.

This mailing list lives in fear.  &quot;Information wants to be free&quot; sure isn't
your attitude, eh?

F**k tact, love that?  Truth is what matters, not being friendly.  Oh my
god, I bet that value isn't something you want to see someone say.  We have
to all agree with you that Tact is what matters, not quality, honesty,
openess and other values that some people who lack tact may have.

We should all be driving Mercedes Benz instead of a VW, suing each other,
and supporting &quot;the system&quot; all the way to the bank after exploiting the
world.  People NEED to be told what to do, they NEED protection, dictators
are a good thing.

You don't like my archive interface?  Why don't you get the data and make
your own... but wait, I'm not allowed to share or distribute that data!
Gee, why was it that I wanted to share it in the first place, to allow
people to have their own interface?  Oh yha.  OH, but EVERYONE will like
Ken's interface, yha!  I'm going to wait for that.

Don't let the logic upset you.  I'm just one person, I should be ignored,
because I don't honor &quot;chain of command&quot;.  Or maybe I just get confused if
the chain starts at one end with the users or at the other end with a guy
who owns the domain.

Hahahaha, hysteria, fun.

I think certain people need to learn a lesson in tact and 
chain of command...

Any time you go around your boss or immediate superior 
you should expect to be handed your walking papers.

Whether anyone likes it or not, Hooper owns Type2_dot_com. He 
is very protective of the content and access and we are 
all the better for it.

Whether anyone likes it or not, Type2_dot_com is better run as 
a dictatorship than like a democracy.  A democracy is nice 
until you try to get a group to make decisions or get 
things done in a timely manner.

Before you go spouting off wait &amp; see what Hooper has 
planned.  Chances are we will end up with an archive with 
a better design that is easier to navigate &amp; get useful 
information from (no offense).

Anyone having withdrawal from being without a bus list for 
a week really should look for something else to enrich 
their life.

Dave
