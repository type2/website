I like buses in the sky too. We could make the web site like a perpetual
nirvana. Were paradise is one big bus meet.

Thanks,

&gt; We should call it buses in the sky.

So simple yet so functional and novel.  I like it.

I'm willing to start a simple one page memorial website (for starters) that
makes brief mention of our dearly departed listees.  Maybe I can at least
create some kind of online tribute just so we don't forget these people.  We
owe it to them.
