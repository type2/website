Subject: Original glass-windshield advice
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

Executive summary:
Get unscratched windshield glass whether OEM or recut.
Background:
When restoring the 67RFH, Paula and I decided to
install the scratched original safari glass in lieu of
having clean, clear, nice, freshly cut non-logo glass
installed. Whoops! wrong decision...
I think we had some unfounded fear that the mythical
&quot;Vintage Nazis&quot; would send us to VW_Hell if we didn't
have just the right logo. Keep in mind that those
whacky Vintage Nazis wont be driving your beast on the
next curvey two lane back roads at night in that
rainstorm with the highbeamed head-on traffic coming
at you and the impatient tweaker semitruck driver on
your arse.
My favorite example of bad conditions for bad glass is
the lovely AZ highway &lt;95?&gt; that runs between
Kingman,AZ and Wickenburg,AZ. It's a shortcut between
Kingman and Phoenix. It's a one lane in each direction
favorite of truckers and tired out drunks coming home
from LasVegas. Not a good place for scratched
windshields at night!
Advice:
Get the appropriate windshield glass cut and use the
logo poop elsewhere. Ask the VintageNazis and the
overly opinionated GrayPrimerMilitia &lt;crowd with more
gossip,opinions and rust than maintained VWs and
actual experience&gt; to mind their own bidnezz or
provide the glass if they cap on you for not having
the logo.
