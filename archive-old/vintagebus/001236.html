I have a book/pamphlet on steering wheel restoration that I bought from
Eastwood for about $10 I think.  It's well worth it.

It says:

- us a polyester primer that comes with a catalyst hardener such as
&quot;Morton's Eliminator&quot; or &quot;Feather Fill&quot;.  Morton's is the favorite since it
can be water sanded.

- for paint, us an acrylic lacquer.  The favorite is R.M. brand but Dupont
and Ditzler tie for second choice.


Good luck.
