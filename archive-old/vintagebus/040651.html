Greeting listees,

I am starting to work on the cargo section of my 66.  I am looking for
opinions in regards the the quality of replacement cargo floor sections
(Both left and right)  Are the pans sold by RMMW any good?  Wolfsburg?
Scohfield?  Or is there any descent re-pops on the market.  The most
important thing I am searching for is restoration quality.  I have section
out of a bus but it really needs alot of work.  I would much rather invest
in a high quality re-pop if available.

Any input or experience would be helpful.  If anyone is curious I will let
you know what I find out.

Thanks!

Kirt
