Well,

I would say that if i were shipping middle seats and had a couple, i would
clamp one down and attach teh second one to the first one with ratcheting
tiedowns or other such devices.

Short of a rollover that will suffice, maybe pad between em and be careful
that the ratchets are hanging in open space.  If you do have a rollover i
would assume that the seats will stay in place but sustain some damage,
though at this point the middle seats being damaged will probably be the
least of your concern...

Probably any kind of tying down is unneccecary to protect the seats, they
are pretty heavy and wont move much if you wedge them in right, what you
are protecting is your noggin in case of accidents, a flying middle seat
can bash ones brains but good.

take care,

Steve
