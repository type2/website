Could you folks take a look at the link below and give me an opinion please?
I done a write up on the webpage about what I know about the Bus.  I'd just
like to hear some opinion if you think the price is OK.  One thing that
stopped me from making an offer on the phone without driving it first was
the owner said the tranny made a bit of noise that he didn't know if it was
normal or not.
