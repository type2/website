Finally replaced the ignition switch today. Been dreading it, hate working 
upside down behind the dash. Anyway, I forgot one wire went to the light 
switch. The problem was intermittent, and wonder what the odds are it was 
truly the ignition switch rather than the light switch. The light switch 
looks more fragile. Any thoughts?
