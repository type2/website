&gt; Just wondering if anyone else is tired of all of the self-absorbed 
&gt; trip reports

Well, Shawn, the list is quite useful and some of the most useful
information I have found _was_ in trip reports.  

Things like how people coped with problems on the road, what spares
they took with them, how they handled routine maintainance on the
road, etc.

The other thing that trip reports provide is _confidence_.  Knowing
what others have done makes it easier for people to get on the road
and enjoy their buses to the fullest.

Sometimes I read about places that I end up visiting.  It's great to
have a &quot;real-life&quot; perspective of what is happening.  What to see,
what to avoid, where to stay, etc.

Since trip reports aren't strictly technical, they are a &quot;friday&quot;
topic, but they are still a valuable contribution to the lists.

For those who like to read self-absorbed trip reports, I just put mine
on the type2 list.  Just go to:

http://www.type2_dot_com 

and select &quot;Read type2 from the web&quot;.  Look for &quot;George's Summer
Vacation&quot;.  It's in four parts.
