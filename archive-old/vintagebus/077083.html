Subject: bus runs again

On thanksgiving, I posted saying my bus wouldn't
go....
Started fine, idled fine, but had no power to push the
bus forward...Problem would kind of come and go.
In case anyone was curious, I got it all worked out.
Once again, clara was right! I pulled off the line to
the fuel pump, and only a weak dribble came out, so I
knew there was some kind of clog between the tank and
the pump. I'm guessing it's in or around the tank tap,
So there was no point in taking that all apart in the
snow...
So I rigged up my own auxiliary gas tank:
I took my 1 gallon gas can, and made the pourer into a
gas line fitting, by cutting it down, and wrapping
some duct tape around the line. 
Then I routed the gas line through a rust hole in the
walkthrough-spare tire well, and bungeed the gas can
to the spare tire mount there. Got me home, but I had
to stop for a fill up about every 10 or 15 miles!
Thanks everyone for your help and suggestions. 
I blame this list entirely for rekindling my
interest/ability with busses!
