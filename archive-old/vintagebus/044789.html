In a message dated 98-10-23 13:09:11 EDT, you write:

&lt;&lt; Never time by #3 or have your #3 cylinder plug hooked into this notched
mark area of the distributor. 
 Are you saying not to do this because of the geometry of the distributor
shaft relative to #3? or is there another reason?  &gt;&gt;
Hi Joe,
The lobe for the points for the #3 position is ground at the factory so it is
about 3 degrees retarded in relation to the rest of the cylinders.  This was
done because #3 was behind the behind the oil cooler which made it hotter in
pre-dog house cooling systems.  Even when this later cooling system was
introduced the #3 cylinder was still in a area that gets less cooling air
compared to the other cylinders due to it's position.  If one times the engine
to the proper degree for #1 using the #3 lobe all your cylinders will be moved
up 3 degrees and which will cause overheating and possibly detonation in all
cylinders.  Eric &amp; Barb
