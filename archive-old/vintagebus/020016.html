Just curious, these switches seem designed to come apart for repair.
They are held together by a few pressed in areas that look like they would
pry apart easily.  

Reason I ask: I fixed my starting problem by replacing the electrical portion
of my locking steering column with my spare; I don't need to use a quarter to
short the connections anymore to start it.  I think I may be able to fix the
old one because it was not &quot;broken&quot; exactly.  Its problem is simply that it 
wants to turn a hair farther before completing the circuit than the tumbler 
wants to let it go.  I used to get it to work by installing it slightly canted
in the hole.  When that stopped working I applied some pressure to it and it
would work.  When that stopped working I used the quarter :-)

So how about it, anybody had one open before?  I'm thinking of giving it a 
shot.  They seem really simple from the outside...

In case anybody thinks I'm really cheap: I can't find these anywhere, and 
people I've talked to say it's like finding a particular needle in a pile
of needles.  The spare I've got I have because Dave Raistrick is about the
swellest guy on the planet ;-)
