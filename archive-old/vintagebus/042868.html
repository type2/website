Well, I've been trying to get my '65 Kombi drivable for acouple weeks now.
I'm just itchin' to be a bus pilot!  I thought I had the answer when a
friend of mine said I could borrow an old 1600 DP that he had out behind
his house.  I hurried and got my trusty red wagen and rolled it across
the street where he lived and brought it over to my house.  That's when I
noticed the  SERIOUS end play.  That thing was moving at least an inch!  I
was so excited about actually driving the beast more than just around the
block that I decided to slap it in the bus and give it a try.  No dice.  I
got around the block with it before it leaked about a quart of oil and
stared to overheat.  There was oil leaking from the oilpump as well.  The
engine was junk!  Oh well, I learned my lesson.  Someday I'll get to drive
my baby....
