Subject: crap case

ronnie told me the other day that the importer of these aluminum 
cases allegedly said that it was &quot;impossible&quot; that i still have sand 
coming out of the casting after many cleanings, grindings and an hour 
of runtime.

i laughed so hard i cried. no, wait, i was already crying........
