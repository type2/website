&gt; Thanks all for the advice concerning the soldering of the connections at the 
&gt; 
&gt; light switch. 

Hi Volksvan12,
Good to hear it has gone well!

&gt; One remaining issues concerns the grounding of the tail lights.  Does anyone 
&gt; have any pictures or procedures for doing this??  I'm not sure what would 
&gt; be easier, soldering a wire to the housing or screwing it to the housing.  
&gt; I know this will clear up any remaining problems.    

It depends on what type and manufature of taillight bulbholder/reflector.  
The easiest way to state it is that some bulbholders/reflectors are one piece 
cast potmetal, while others are a mixture of cast potmetal and pressed steel, 
pressed/riveted together.  Take a magnet and test the bulbholder for steel, 
no magnet action and you have all potmetal bulbholder/reflector.  Steel you 
can solder to if you have a high enough wattage soldering iron or carefully 
use a propane soldering tip on a propane torch or even an old fashioned blow 
torch and soldering iron.  Cast potmetal you have to drill and nut and screw 
the wire to or better yet in a thick area of the potmetal thread for more 
surface area.  Using an dielectric grease will help keep down future 
corrosion here and throughout all connections in the wiring system.  Only the 
signal switch if self canceling is not a good place for dielectric grease, 
instead use a sprayable contact cleaner with silicon protection to keep 
future corrosion at bay.  If you use grease, oil, or other lubricant the 
switch will not lock into postion and will just flip off.
