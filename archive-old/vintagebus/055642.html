&gt; &gt; I'm both.
&gt;
&gt;You forgot to mention Boy Scout and have a Master
&gt;degree.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; Don't mistake concern for stupidity.
&gt;
&gt;I have no doubt you have much concern. I also don't
&gt;doubt your stupidity either.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; Directed at no person in particular but if you
&gt; &gt; haven't figure out that
&gt; &gt; messages with &quot;RATBASTARDS&quot; or &quot;Bad manners&quot; in the
&gt; &gt; subject heading is going
&gt; &gt; to be about the terrorist attacks you might not want
&gt; &gt; to be calling others
&gt; &gt; ignorant.  Also, if you haven't figured out how to
&gt; &gt; use the delete key when
&gt; &gt; you see those messages you definitely shouldn't be
&gt; &gt; calling others ignorant.
&gt;
&gt;Ignorance is lacking knowledge, stupidity is having
&gt;knowledge but unable to apply it. Why should
&gt;subscribers to a vintage bus list have to delete
&gt;dozens of emails because some are too stupid to follow
&gt;the charter of the list, and too stupid to go find a
&gt;list or newsgroup that discusses the topic they want
&gt;to force on everyone?
&gt;
&gt; &gt; Yes, this is a bus list.
&gt;
&gt;Well mighty wide of you to notice.
&gt;
&gt; &gt;And messages, for the most
&gt; &gt; part, should be about
&gt; &gt; busses.
&gt;
&gt;One of the admins posted the charter earlier. Read it.
&gt;You'll find that messages should be about busses.
&gt;Period.
&gt;
&gt; &gt;But in a time of crisis (terrorist attacks
&gt; &gt; qualify in my book) a
&gt; &gt; little easing of the rules is appropriate.
&gt;
&gt;Well this is a departure, now it's &quot;a little easing of
&gt;the rules&quot;, instead of &quot;null and void&quot;. In case you
&gt;have forgotten, last week you pmailed me this, &quot;When
&gt;the list charter was written there had never been a
&gt;terrorist attack killing 6,000 people on US soil...or
&gt;any countries soil for that matter. The world was not
&gt;potentially headed into World War 3. I believe all
&gt;list rules were rendered null and void around 9am on
&gt;9/11/2001&quot;
&gt;
&gt; &gt;Dealing
&gt; &gt; with terrorist attacks
&gt; &gt; in the homeland is something new for Americans...
&gt;
&gt;Have you forgotten Oklahoma City?
&gt;
&gt; &gt;and
&gt; &gt; the list is
&gt; &gt; predominately made up of US citizens.
&gt;
&gt;So perhaps we need the US Vintage Bus list and the
&gt;Non-US Vintage Bus list.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; We all deal
&gt; &gt; with it in our own way.
&gt;
&gt;And obviously you and some others put yourself above
&gt;the list charter and force others to put up with your
&gt;emails, or spend time and bandwith deleting your
&gt;off-topic posts.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; Please be patient while your friends work through
&gt; &gt; it.
&gt;
&gt;Please be considerate of your fellow bus listees by
&gt;&quot;working through it&quot; in proper channels. Go see a
&gt;counselor, join a support group, find a list or
&gt;newsgroup that deals with the topic. When you want to
&gt;talk about busses, then come back to the list.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; Thanks for the tolerance Thom.
&gt;
&gt;Thank the whole list for their tolerance. We've heard
&gt;enough. Move on or move to a more appropriate place.
