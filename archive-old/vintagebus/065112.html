&gt; I am all over that Honda Element as well...
&gt; The cool thing is they put utility above
&gt; looks. I am 6' 2&quot; and can sleep in the back of the Element, it has a
&gt; diamond plate rubber mat that runs the full length of the rig, it is a
&gt; walk thru, the back seats fold up against the wall or remove easily, it
&gt; is offered in 4 wheel drive,

Well, kind of 4WD.  Nice for snow, not for real off-road use.  Ground
clearance is only 7 inches, generous for a car, not much for off road.

&gt; it gets 26 miles per gallon

Well, that's EPA highway.  I figure it'll do a bit better than my bus.  Of
course, with 500 pounds more weight and 100 extra horsepower that is a
considerable improvement.

 and fully
&gt; decked out it is right around $20,000

$21,000 plus about $2000 &quot;additional dealer profit&quot; markup, most likely.

&gt; (the base model is like 16)

I figure they'll make about five of those.  No radio, no air, no sales.

. The
&gt; other cool thing is by making it a &quot;BOX&quot;, the outside of the thing is
&gt; about the size of a Subaru Forester but the inside is bigger than alot
&gt; of these stupid SUV's running around.

Unfortunately, it is a lot smaller inside than a bus, which has pretty
much the same footprint.  Gotta have that crush zone!

&gt; First really smart car I have seen
&gt; in a while. I also picture it with genuine simulated wood grain panels
&gt; stuck on the side to cheese it up a bit. I saw one of these in person at
&gt; a ski show last week.

Their marketing is silly though.  They're so desparate for the &quot;Gen Y&quot;
male 16-25 that they are marketing this thing as a &quot;rolling dorm room&quot; as
if that is a good thing.  What they don't realize is that the gen Y males
don't have enough money to buy the thing!  I think they'll sell quite a
few even with the bad marketing.
