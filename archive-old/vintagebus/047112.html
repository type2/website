So the gas heater I wanna stick in my bus is a BN 2,  so what exactly is the

difference, in a nutshell, between the various BN's.  My understanding is

BN2 is from an early 70's beetle but does it really matter which one I put

in my bus.  This BN 2 looks awesome.  The point doesn't even looked

scratched, but I'm missing a switch.  Is there a prefered place to put these

things, i.e. I've seen one installed under the driver's seat and it looked

to me like a factory installation, but I realize the most common place is in

the engine bay opposite the battery.

 .. . ....
ya a BN2 is from a bug, think they mount under the hood
the BN4s were mounted opposite the battery, works good.
I have also seen diagrams for installing a heater in the spare tire well, the 
heat vents out by the drivers feet.  Not sure which kind.  THink that was 
intended more for panel vans with the cab partition.   
Seen a stewart arner mounted in the treasure chest, venting i nto the cab.
