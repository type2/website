&gt; Ronnie,
&gt; This is great!  I was just composing a message telling you how much I
&gt; hated Kadrons, etc. etc.:) and would you have this type of engine around
&gt; you might try.  The numbers on your 74X88 were great.  The torque curve
&gt; wasn't even a curve.  I'm impressed.  If only it didn't have Kadrons!
&gt; Also something I have been interested in is the 34pict/dp manifold with SP
&gt; end castings.  I tried this on my 69X88 engine and the quality of the
&gt; Taiwanese adaptor end castings was so terrible that I had to give up.

For a single port, it would seem like a relatively easy job to fabricate a
SP manifold to accommodate the 34 carburator.  I hate to see a single port
motor stuck with a dual-port manifold and the accompanying vacuum leaks at
the boots.

Even the dual-port manifold center section is nothing but piping.  No
flow-enhancing shapes from carb to horizontal pipe there!
