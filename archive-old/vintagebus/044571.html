on the westy tag on your Z bed- the on ethat says SO-42, it will say what 
year it came out of.  regardless of slitty or bar, it can be bolted into you 
67 with seat T bolt, large washers, and appropriate nuts.  If it is splitty, 
you will need to install traingle supports for the bed to fold down 
supporting the rear part, or it will sag and give you an awful crick in the 
back. The bay seats have buildt in supports which work better.   The westys 
came with another welded in support at the pass side that the westys screws 
the bottom of the Z bed to, but it functions fine w/o, or at least has in my 
61 deluxe which has a bay westy Z bed in it

The bay window side cabinet will have to be cut shirter to fit.   Gene 
(mizamook_at_ something_dot_com) has one of these in his 66 westy (did ya notice the 
cabinet door by the bed folds the other way?) Which was modified to fit when 
me and my ex has the bus, as it was missing then.

happy camping
