Incidentally on this point of the 7.25, just a heads up:

Most retail outfits don't know this, but if you buy something mail order,
and it is shipped by common carrier, namely, UPS, FedEx, (just not the
stores own vehicle) you are only required to pay 7.25.  Not the rate of
wherever it is that you &quot;bought&quot; it.
