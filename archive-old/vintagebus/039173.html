Morning list,

Turns out that my &quot;1961&quot; doublecab is actually a December 1959
doublecab! I was around at fellow listee Christian Figenschou's place on
the weekend trying to wrestle a nice steering wheel off a parts bus of
his when he started checking out my M code tag.

Both the M code date line and the VIN agree, this is a '59 for sure.
Since buying my van 6 years back I have happily swallowed and repeated
the story I got from the PO. He said he was the first owner and that he
had  imported the van to South Africa himself. Christian showed me the
port code &quot;SF&quot; which means that the van was an official VW import, so he
didn't import it.

I guess it's possible that he ordered it but that wouldn't explain the 2
year difference in the age of the vehicle.

I must be a nut as I'm thrilled off my head to find out that my daily
driver is actually two years older than I thought. Glad it wasn't a '98
Toyota!

Later 

Michael  ('59 doublecab)
