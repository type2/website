I now  use 5/30 synthetic and Baldwin filters on my fresh

Hi lake.show,
Good to hear!  At swap meets we have come across  stock pre-1971 oil coolers 
where the flattened cooling tubes have  been swelled to an &quot;O&quot; shape due to 
oil pressure over 80 PSI.  The air  flow through the cooler is drastically 
reduced, and the &quot;O&quot; shape creates an  eddy behind it reducing the cooling even 
more.  Not good!
