The reason sunroof parts are so spendy here in Eugene is that they have very 
little wear due to our lousy weather...just kidd'n.
     Higher prices just seem to hand in hand with the Internet.  Once upon a 
time, you could score a fairly nice splittie project for around $200, the 
price I paid for my '58 (found it 3 blocks from my home)  But people soon 
found they could sell the same bus on the Internet for $750-$1000, sometimes 
more if you parted it out.  Why not?  Used to be the market here was from 
Portland to Roseburg, now it's world wide!!!  Hence, prices here have pretty 
much gone battshit crazy.  I feel your pain....but then again you really can 
blame folks, it's a sellers market and if you don't pay the price, someone 
else will.
     Good luck finding your parts!!  May the Volkswagens Gods smile upon your 
project.
