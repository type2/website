Matt:

Thanks for the tip. As it turns out, I found some screws at a hardware 
surplus store today that look as though they will work.

Skid



The book mentions a screw &quot;...with an extra thin head...&quot;.  It looks
like the head has to be thin to fit in the space that the rivet used
to, and not poke in to the door jamb.  What you might do is find
a slotted countersink 8mm screw that fits the hole and is long
enough for the bolt and try it in the door.  Probably its head will
stick up some, so take it back out of the door and file or grind the
head down to fit.  You may need to deepen the slot a little with a
fine hacksaw blade or cut-off wheel in a Dremel to give your screwdriver
enough grip.

Good luck!
