&lt;&lt; I have a 63 samba that I am getting ready to restore.  Both front doors 
and the right cargo door have rusted through.    
 ...The right cargo door is completly rusted through along the inside bottom 
from front to back.
 Any sugestions on how to repair the rust throughs?  Does anyone sell curved

the easiest way is to find some nice straight rust free doors and bolt them 
on.
