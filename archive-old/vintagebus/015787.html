Three suspicious things here.  First, when you rebuilt the carb, were
you extra-careful to make sure the float moved easily?  If it's not
cutting off the fuel when the bowl is full, you'll flood out.  Second,
is the output pressure of the fuel pump correct?  Too strong, and it
doesn't matter how good your float valve is, it'll just fountain right
past it.  Finally, even on a warm day, you need some choke.  The choke
doesn't cut out until things are well over 100F in its vicinity.  I
doubt you're getting ambient temperatures that high quite yet.
