Subject: Sunroof

    I have finally finished the brake job I started in May, and hope to
move on to something new.
When I bought my bus the PO had already removed the slider assembly, so
I've never seen it installed, which brings me to my questions...

        1) Are the blocks that slide in the roof channel supposed to be
wood. If so does anyone
            make reproductions (or does any one need a set, they look
easy to make!)

        2) Can you use the -'63 sunroof handle on a '64-'67 front
locking bow? The bows seem the
            same other than the handle, but not sure. ( the bow that
came with the van is really rusted.)

        3) Has anyone installed a sunroof cover? The one I got from
W.C.M. has no instructions, and
            the pictures in the Bentley are kind on lacking. Any tips
would be appreciated.

        4) I have to replace the two strips of  &quot;rubberized canvas&quot; that
run down the outer side of the
            bows. Are the bows supposed to be a certain distance apart
and is each one spaced equally
            from the front to the back

B.T.W. Drove up and down the driveway today for the first time with
brakes, only a couple more
weekends and it will be on the road. Also bought Safari Windows from
Izz's at the Seattle V.W.
show and they are THE best aftermarket ones out there. I will post after
I install them as to how
they went in. I also bought the round mirrors and stainless mirror post
from Izz, very nice! And
they look so &quot;kewl&quot;.
