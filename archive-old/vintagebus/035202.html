Subject: RE: [VB] Dangerous Brakes!

&quot;I have been driving old VWs for 15 years and this was my first failure of
brakes. All the brake equipment was replaced just one year ago with Varga
parts. This event could easily have killed myself and wife, please respond
with any info. Thankyou, Lou &amp; Liz in Havasu&quot; 

Ouch!  Thank God you all are okay!  Whew!

You have probably already read the article about the dual circuit master
cylinder in the type2 library.  Here is an additional part that may take
some work out of the conversion.  It is made by Wolfgang Int.  PN# 2611011
$40.  This is an adapter plate kit for the 71-79 dual circuit MC, this will
take the cutting out of the original instructions by Eric and Barb.

My MC was slipping a little so I just installed a regular single circuit MC
in my bus, but I plan on getting this Wolfgang part and installing the '75
MC I have on the shelf...  I have been lazy about it so far.

You will need mass quantities of penetrating oil as well.  A week of PB
Blaster worked miracles on my crusty old MC, might have been stock.


Take Care,
