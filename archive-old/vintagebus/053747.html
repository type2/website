Subject: RE: [VB] Metal Fuel Line Safety

Couldn't agree more!  Strange tidbit is...I have owned 6 old typeII's and I
have only seen Copper line, never steel!

What was OEM (I assume copper)?  What is the consensus on the best retrofit?

Copper?  That's the wrong material for fuel lines in a vehicle!  Fuel
lines hsoulg be steel.  I use brake line when I need to replace metal
line.
