Subject: [VB] Re; door handles needed 
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

&gt;&gt;I have a 60 dbl door and would like to have all the doors keyed the same.  
Can I buy new custom made or is it better to buy used if they are 
available.......are they available????&lt;&lt;&lt;

Hi Kevin,
Best to buy good used ones and or use your present ones.  Then have an old 
fashion locksmith redo the tumblers so they match.  If there are no old 
locksmiths in your area you can try Gabriel in CA.  He may even have good 
used or NOS handles or availible.
