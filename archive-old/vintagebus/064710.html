Subject: Re: [VB] Spongebob bus source?

Well, I'd buy one if there weren't any strings attached. 

Here's my splanations...

1. It's the cheapest and best quality. Barbie's microbus will be $5 at the swap 
meet next year but that's with a years worth of blonde inflicted dents and 
damage. Not true with made-for-collectors overpriced crap like the HW hotrod 
bus series. 

2. The more the merrier. We all like to see lots of buses lined up at bus 
meets. I like lots of buses on my shelf too. Squint my eyes and relive the day. 
(note to self - create D&amp;D type game based on AZ bus weekends)

3. It's a vote. If bus toys fly off the shelves hopefully it'll cause R&amp;D money 
to enter the stream. A letter to the companies asking for more variety helps 
and a &quot;I bought all your same-mold toys, make some interesting models&quot; lends 
credibility. A &quot;bus toys don't move&quot; message will stop every bus toy. 

4. It's cultural history. Sponge Bob Square Pants will be as cute as a Buddy L 
bus in 40 years. Japanese tin buses were cheap and crude in their day, now have 
charm and value. 

5. Convenience. My mantle can hold a lot more buses than my driveway.

&gt; I have yet to figure out the appeal of all of these commerical
&gt; toy buses.  Every few months, they slap the pop icon du jour on
&gt; the same die, and the bus people go crazy.  I bet if they made a
&gt; Tampax bus these guys would be lining up on ebay to buy them. Why?
