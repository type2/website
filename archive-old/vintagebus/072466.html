Subject: Re: [VB] stuck drum update

&gt; looking at the eastwood tool again it says &quot;not to be used as a pulling
&gt; tool&quot; I guess it's not strong enough. In the bently manual on page V-4, 1
&gt; it shows the proper tool. What are my chances of finding something like
&gt; that? (not good thinks I)  Is there a Hazet tool or similar tool like it
&gt; that is well made. Is John &quot;hazetguy&quot; still around?


hazet_dot_com full catalog  there is a five arm puller 781-5

I dont see it listed at samstag but they or John should be able to order
it.
http://www.samstagsales_dot_com/hazet.htm
phone is (615) 735-3388

It probably wont be cheap.
