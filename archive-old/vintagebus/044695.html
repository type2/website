 transmission fluid.
 
 is their a specific type of redline I should get, or is there only one type.
 
 thanks. &gt;&gt;
You want MT90.  I think you can get it at Aircooled_dot_net.  I am at work and 
don't have their website at hand.  I'm sure someone in the group can give you 
specific infor before I get home this evening.
