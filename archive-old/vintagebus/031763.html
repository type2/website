Subject: New Bus/L A traffic sucks

   I am back after 17 hours and 700 miles of driving (thank the big G I have
a diesel truck with air). I dropped a bus off in HB, Cali. to be shipped to
England (tried to sell it here but nobody wanted it, again, $900.00 rust
free 67 deluxe rolling shell). Anyway, it took me 3 hours to go the first
230 miles then another 3 hours to do the last 70. L A traffic SUCKS, smog,
very RUDE drivers, bumper to bumper cr#p, etc.etc. 
  I logged the miles from here (Havasu) to Christmas tree Island is 230
miles. From Christmas tree Island to West Coast Classics (Lennys pre Classic
Party) is 50 miles, add approx. 5 more miles and your at the OCTO show.
Let's hope the traffic isn't as bad on Sat Morning when the busavan leaves
Christmas Tree Island to OCTO!
   Proceeded to continue the journey to pick up my 60 DC, another 2 hours to
go 50 miles, damn that L A traffic, you would think that the traffic would
lighten up after slow (rush) hour traffic, but NOOOOO. Did the last 100
miles in less then 1 1/2 hours out to California City, a hell hole in the
middle of the desert and proceeded to pick up the DC. 
   What I got was a 2 owner 1960 DC, rust free, the bus had been stripped
and blasted, all body work completed, just needs final massage and
primer/paint. The person I bought it from got it from the original owner, he
then parked it and proceeded to start to restore it, that was 7 years ago.
As I was loading parts there were boxes and boxes of new parts for it. Over
the years he had collected everything needed to complete this bus, some in
duplicates. The coolest thing I got with it was a set of NOS Brazilian BUS
headlight assemblies, haven't seen those around in years. The bus is missing
a few pieces that I either have or will try to locate (more on that later),
but it's ready to go. I didn't STEAL this bus, I did pay top dollar, but the
condition of the bus reflects the price, no welding or major body work
necessary, that was worth the price alone.
   Anyway does somebody out there know when they quit using crank start
aprons? This bus came with one and it's the same color paint as the original
bus, but when looking at the 40hp that came with the bus, there is no crank
start provision.
  One of the funny things I found was that the cargo door had been
reshinned, over the old skin, very nice job though!! Also it is a high
hindge door with the wedges.

   So now all I need is the time to work on it, or should I do the 60 westy
first?

ronnie, tired but home safe and L A traffic su#ks!
