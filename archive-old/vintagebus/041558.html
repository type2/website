&gt; HI
&gt; 
&gt; I am trying to change a type 3 engine into an upright motor for my 61
&gt; bus.  It is a 1600 dp and had fuel injection and all the type 3 stuff.
&gt; (Which has been removed and is for sale, cheap!) I have noticed that the
&gt; distributor drive shaft is turned a little different than on a normal
&gt; type 1 or bus engine.  Do I need to try to remove it and turn it to the
&gt; normal position? Or do I just adjust the notch on the distributor body so
&gt; that the rotor points at it when #1 cylinder is at TDC?  If I leave it
&gt; like it is, do I set my timing differently? Or will it still be 7.5
&gt; degrees btdc? (I am using a 009 distributor.) Thank you for any help you
&gt; can provide.

Just set the rotor to point at the notch when #1 is at TDC of the firing
stroke.  This will work fine for a 009, but if you ever switch to a vacuum
distributor you will have to reposition the distributor drive to allow
clearance for the vacuum can.
