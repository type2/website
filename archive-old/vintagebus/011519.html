Subject: '54 Deal-Part 2

VanBondo recently purchased a 1954 VW bus. Here is Part 2 of the adventure.
I am breaking this report up into several smaller sized segments. This
segment covers insights into the Barbie Twins and Bungee Jumping. Part 1
ended with my considerate inclusion of my Chili cooking life-partner &lt;wife&gt;
in deciding to buy this bus. Actually, I was crawling like an abused puppy
in hopes that it wouldn't mean Divorce Court.


The VanBondo Barbie Twins theory:
To her credit and fortunate for me, I had caught my wife in what I describe
as the &quot;Barbie Twins Weekend.&quot; My theory is that there is one occasional,
magical, weekend in which my wife is so agreeable that I could &lt;almost&gt;
invite the Barbie Twins over for a menage a trios in the living room. The
theory suggests that the Chili cookin' lady would only roll her eyes and ask
if everyone had a fresh beer and commadaire the vidcam. Reality is far from
the theory~trust me. The other weekends can sometimes result in public
execution for breathing wrong. I tend to adjust the valves and do total VW
restorations on those alternate weekends. I have never had the cajones or
inclination to go for the Twins. I'll stick to that goofy notion of being
faithful.  I can't imagine dealing with more than one woman. Kinky? You'll
never know. Sadist? Definitely not and Kenneth Starr is not my cup of tea.
My lovely and extremely patient wife &lt;she will probably read this&gt; agreed to
the Barn deal in exchange for the other half of the community property
rights and my cajones. &lt;maybe she shouldn't read this&gt; I secretly think that
I got a good deal as a result of reading &quot;You Can Negotiate Anything.&quot; =)

Bungee Jumping:
So now, The deal was made after a million email and telephone conversations.
Many photos were placed onto a hidden URL for my review. Transportation was
researched and rough estimates were calculated. My persistence at gleaning
the minutia created a heck of a phone bill and probably made for a PITA
impression of me in the seller's mind. Hey, it was my money that I was
forking over. Time to either make the fateful transaction bung jump or step
back. We took a deep breath, ran, and made the leap of faith. 
In every distance deal there is a moment of free-fall when the funds are
being transferred. You have nothing but air movement and pure silence.
Hopefully the rope holds and saves you and doesn't leave you hanging in the
end or positioned around your neck. Gradual deposits, installment payments,
purchase agreements, or formal contracts only go so far to protect the
parties. A tense day or two rolled by with no email or phone calls. Random
thoughts of being the world's most gullible ***hole ran through my head. I
had transferred the funds and had nothing but air. Others who have imported
have reported to me that they too have experienced the bungee feeling. It
would have been a bummer to have to travel to Denmark to try to recover the
money. Thankfully this time was a safe one. Finally a confirmation came
through and documents appeared in the mail slot. Whew! Now I had to figure
out the details of getting this cool odd duck from there to here...

Next time- Part 3: Shipping Fun and Final Analysis
