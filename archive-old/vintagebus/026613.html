Mike,

YES this is a common and very dangerous problem.  You should take a hammer and
punch and peen the fitting in place by peening some of the surrounding carb
body aluminum on top of the brass fitting this should keep it in place.  Make
sure that it does not leak!  If it does, replace the carb or seal it with JB
weld or similar epoxy (Marine-Tex, etc.).

You are very lucky that your motor did not catch on fire!  We all know what
nice atomized gasoline and an air cooled motor can do to your bus.  We should
all remember to do this in addition to replacing fuel lines and carrying an
extinguisher.

Drive safe in to 2000!!

Steve
