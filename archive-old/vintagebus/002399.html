Having the DC completely apart, this subject is right up my task list.
I've decided to use tar*, followed by the roofer's membrane** and silver
stuff that looks like bubble wrap pushed in and held by the panels. It's
light enough and I can remove it to check for interior rust.

*Tar... Is this really roofing patch cement, brand name Henry? I don't
have a tar pot to heat and mop the 'real' tar on, and would be a messy
job in the ceiling. Suspect the Henry patch has petroleum distillates,
but should be out-gassed by the time I get the other stuff in/on. Same
stuff used to seal windows, Eric?
Another question, will it melt and drip from the ceiling during our 110f
heat? Guess I'll have to read a can &amp; report back.

**Membrane... The Home Despot has 1/4&quot; or so thick sheets for lining
shower pans in home construction. Is this the stuff, or is the roof
membrane better? If it works well, I'll stamp some cute name on it
(Rumble-Gone, Fweem-Less, Tekno-Kewl-Def-Mat) and make a bundle.
