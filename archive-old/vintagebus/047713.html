Hi NFA,
First try a longer cheater bar.  We recently had to use a 8' one on a axle
nut.  If that does not work then do not use heat to loosen it or cut it off.
This will change the temper of the steel and waste or worse make it dangerous
to use this axle later!  Instead use a hammer and chisel to cut one side of
the nut.  You do not have to even cut it all the way.  Just the chiseling
will spread the nut and loosen it on the axle.  This same use on stuck exaust
nuts loosens them so you do not have to break off the head studs.   Eric&amp;Barb
