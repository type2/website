My damn mail system sucks, BTW. I am thinking about getting very unexcited
about excite.

Anyway....
I went to one of my favorite local electrical rebuild shops today. A little
shack just outside of Olympia. I asked if they could rewire my 6v wiper
moter to a 12. They said they could but recommended against it. They said it
would cost way too much as opposed to a voltage drop.

So if I wanted to......$200. I know somebody on this list may consider that
an option, so I post it. About $200 and you can have a 12v wiper motor.
The reason it is so expesive is the small parts. But then again you get a
completly rebuilt unit.
