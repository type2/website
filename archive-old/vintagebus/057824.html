Subject: Re: [VB] &quot;Schlepping&quot; a transaxle

Hey Rex and list:

Maybe, I'm thinking too easily, but I'm a little guy and am always trying to find
a way to make things easier.  Wouldn't it be easier to pull the 8 nuts off of each
side, removing the tranny sides.  Rubber mallet the next layer of the side out and
then remove the cir clip thingy and isn't that about it too pulling the tranny
sides, axles, redux boxes and a Whole bunch of weight off.  Now granted, I'm
probably making this a little to easy in that I'm assuming the nuts all come off
easy and what not, but a can of liquid wrench and the right tools could do
wonders.

If you don't like that idea.  How about a flat bed wagon with those knobby tires?
Then you only lift it once to get it on the wagon and once into the truck.  No
carrying what so ever.

What about mounting wheels with really big tires on the drums and something like a
camber compensator to the axles to hold the tranny up and just rolling it to the
truck?  Would only work if redux are locked up is suppose.

Ok I'm done.  Hope I helped a little,
Aaron
