Isaiah, David:
And either change the lube in the transaxle or drive the thing long enough (50
to 100 miles!) to boil out the water that may have come into the transaxle
thru the vent hole on the top.
A while back I had the opportunity to disassemble a 79 trans that had been in
a flood. Sure enough the needle bearing on the end of the pinion was rusty/
ruined! Driving this transaxle a few hundred miles would surely have ruined
the whole thing.

&gt;
&gt; After that deep of water, You'd be well advised to flush fresh grease
&gt; through your front beam, pump grease in your ball joints if you have
&gt; nipples, and repack your front wheel bearings...rears wouldnt be a bad
&gt; idea either.

&gt; Bearings dont like water...
