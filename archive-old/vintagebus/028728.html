    i almost fell out of my chair... railroad tracks indeed :)
    i'd say it works, though...
    your friend's uncle wouldn't have happened to have an alignment rack stashed in
his shop, maybe...? ;)
    the mental image, you must admit, sounds kind of funny... and what would you
tell the cops if they showed up?
    hehehe.... i will however keep that trick in mind if i am stranded somewhere
w/o the proper tools....

later...

&gt; That reminds me of a friend of mine that had and uncle back in the 70s

&gt; like the cheapest way to do it and it sounds like it's pretty effective.
