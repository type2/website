&lt;&lt; I'm not really sure what I mean.  When I took out my gas tank I removed the
 valve at the bottom.  The threads seem strange, maybe one is left hand and
 one is right hand?&gt;&gt;
Hi Jdd,
Correct!  This allow the tightening of the reserve switch while keeping the 
switch in one position and not ending up turned the wrong way in relation to 
the reserve switch cable.

&lt;&lt;Anyway, in the bently it mentions a cork gasket or seal or something which 
wasn't there when I took the valve (or cock or whatever it's called) off.  
So, I'm a wonderin' what to do.  Maybe I should get some gasket material and 
just try and make one.&gt;&gt;
Yes, you need a dense cardboard gasket (Much like the gasket between the main 
jet and the carb body on pre-1968 VWs.) on top of the fuel strainer sock.  
You can make one out of 1/16&quot; thick gasket stock from your local Shucks for 
about $3.00 a 12&quot;x12&quot; sheet.
 
&lt;&lt;How bout gas line.  I just ordered a couple of meters of the braided stuff 
but isn't there something better to use.  Like maybe some sort of stainless 
steel flexible stuff.&gt;&gt;
The thing is that until someone comes up with a way to braid stainless steel 
wires so tight that fuel does not pass through rubber has to be used.  So far 
all rubber for fuel applications after being exposed to engine oil and ozone 
from the generator turns hard and cracks open.  Yes, the braided German fuel 
line is covered with cloth which seems to protect the rubber longer than the 
exposed rubber material at the ends.  When the ends begin to crack it is a 
sign to replace the fuel line or enjoy your VW barbeque.  Best to just 
replace fuel lines every two or three years.
 
&lt;&lt;BTW I don't think I have to cut any of this engine seal stuff,  it all 
seems to be pre cut.  Hey, maybe I'll soak it in a bucket of hot water and 
use some soap to help slide it in the channel - think it'll help?  &gt;&gt;
Definitely!  Also carefully going over the body channel and undenting any 
part of and cleaning out the channel really helps.  It seems that at VW these 
channels at the ends were dinged on the ends to lock these seals in place.
