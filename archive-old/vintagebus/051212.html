Subject: RE: [VB] Final verdict on oil hemorrhage

That reminds me of the seal that collapsed on me and blocked off the oil
flow. By the time I figured out what was happening, there was smoke pooring
out the back of my bug. Fortunately no fire, but one warped case and a pair
of cracked heads.

Oil really cools, if you can keep it flowing !

Okay,

After pulling the motor and changing the seals, then scouring and
testing and scrubbing and cursing, I took it to a local shop (Mesa West
in Costa Mesa, CA) and they found that the oil cooler itself had
ruptured internally. I'm not sure how that happened, but they put a
reconditioned unit in and I'm good to go! Woohoo!

Thanks to the listees that posted comments and suggestions. Even though
I had to take it somewhere eventually, I feel that I know (much) more
about the workings of my bus now.

Subject: Re: [VB] Rear main seal replacement??


That really bites when you do the work and don't fix the leak!!!!!!!

sounds like you have a doghouse as you mention 4 seals.  usually its the
upright kind that leak, though it's not impossible that yours does.
were the
old seals crunchy?  they should be supple.   in the middle where the oil
flows through is where they crunch first.  once I found one bent into
the
middle so it would block the oil flow!!!!!!!!!!!

puzzling.   pressure check wouldn't be bad idea.  hm which seals did you
use?
 the ones that are higher in the middle than the edges?  or the tubes?
how
high?  what number case do you have?   if you have a small oil passage
case
and use a dighouse (larger passages) you need the seals to fit that are
bigger one side than the other.

you said it looked clean around the main seal- does that mean you pulled
the
FW?  If you pull themotor again do yourself a favor and swap that main
seal
and o ring just cause you don't know how old they are and the parts are
cheap.

when you look at the engine tin to the left of the dist near where it
goes to
the fan housing, does oil drip there?  usually it is oily there with an
oil
cooler leak.   And all over the left side cylinder (look from under
neath at
those)

is it leaking from a push rod tube?  does it drip at idle?   watch with
a
flashlight and try to narrow down the source?

 First of all, thanks to everyone that provided both public and private
 advice on this matter.

 Matt &amp; I pulled the motor today and replaced the 4 oil cooler seals.
The
 cooler -&gt; mount seals had what looked like paint on them and there was
a
 significant amount of oil in/around the area, so I figured that was it.
 We took about 3 hours total and wasn't too difficult, even for me being
 a first-timer! Unfortunately, I am reading this recommendation (replace
 rear main too) a little late.

 We got it buttoned back up and the leak was still there. Aargh!! It is
 still leaking out of the drivers side, although not as bad as before. I
 drove it around for a while this afternoon &amp; evening w/o significant
 loss of oil. I was not able to check it for drippage, since it was
 raining, but have put it away again and will check for leakage in the
 morning.

 The area around the main seal seemed very clean, so I'm not sure what
 the story is with it. The oil cooler looked to be in good condition,
but
 perhaps it could be cracked (?) or damaged somehow.

 Still looking for solutions,
  &gt;&gt;
