&gt;
&gt;A few days ago I had a generator light, so I replaced the brushes. [...] 
&gt;The new brushes fixed the light problems, so I counted the problem as
&gt;fixed.  During the 400 mile drive yesterday, I noted the voltage as
&gt;being rather low, [...] I checked the generator, and the brushes were
&gt;almost completely worn out! [...]
&gt;
&gt;Review of symptoms:
&gt;1. Low voltage (12.0-12.5V) but still charging.
&gt;2. Very rapid brush wear.

For #2 I'd say there are two possible causes:
a) mechanical eroding of the brushes
b) electrical eroding of the brushes (excessive current draw)

For a) you could *probably* tell by looking at the commutator - are the
edges of the bars sharp instead of smooth?  Is the insulation undercut
the right amount?  Is the runout too much?  This might be hard to see
by eye, but it could be caused by a bad bearing which you might be able
to hear or feel.

For b) it could be a lot of things.  You could have a short somewhere
in the system that isn't quite enough to blow things but makes the
generator work overtime to keep up.  If one of the field coils is
shorted to ground, this might happen, but I think you'd notice in in
reduced generator output.  The two field coils are in series, one end
is hooked to D+, and the other comes out to DF to be grounded by
the regulator.  FWIW, the spec for each field coil in the 6V 180W
generator is 1.0-1.1 ohm per Bentley.

Or, it could be something like the regulator points being stuck, 
driving the field coil current to the maximum, causing the generator
voltage (and hence current, for the same load) to be higher.  If your
regulator is the kind with a screw in the top center of the housing
so you can take it apart easily, you might inspect the contact points
inside there.  You might try a new regulator before swapping out the
generator.

Good luck!
