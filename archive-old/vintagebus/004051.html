hey ya list

So the gas heater I wanna stick in my bus is a BN 2,  so what exactly is the
difference, in a nutshell, between the various BN's.  My understanding is
BN2 is from an early 70's beetle but does it really matter which one I put
in my bus.  This BN 2 looks awesome.  The point doesn't even looked
scratched, but I'm missing a switch.  Is there a prefered place to put these
things, i.e. I've seen one installed under the driver's seat and it looked
to me like a factory installation, but I realize the most common place is in
the engine bay opposite the battery.
