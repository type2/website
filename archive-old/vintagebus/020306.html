An early congrats to Dr. Robert- (Surfer Bob), &quot;Don't
call me Bob!,&quot; Davis on his multiple trophies/plaques
that he will receive this weekend at the OCTO/Classic
events.

Good job on the early Westy restoration! and don't let
Blue make you take second place! =) At least try for
the 'under construction' pity F awards.
Hopes are that every one has a fun and safe weekend.
