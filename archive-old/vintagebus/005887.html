I know there is only one splitty in this listing but I tried to think of
those of you who might be looking for a T4 engine for a project, or simply
for an engine rebuilder in your area you didn't know about.  Usually the
splitty nuts know some people who have bay window buses as well so you could
pass that info on to them.  As for the VW Things - as rare at those are and
the prices here are on the lower side, I thought I'd toss them in as well.
If I'm out of line, please privately email me about it...
