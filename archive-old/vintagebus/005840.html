Happy to see you......... happy. It looks like everything worked out good
for you. 16 year old driving under the speed limit is really something. Keep
it going Isaiah and keep your baby in the best of shapes.


Good luck.

Subject: [VB] wheel cylinder rebuild kits


&gt; I got my wheel cylinder rebuild kits in the mail today from BFY Obsolete
&gt; Parts.  Good packing job! :)
&gt; The fronts were 4.50 a piece...but the rears were 10.00 a piece.
&gt; yes...you can buy a new rear cylinder for that price I know... and I
&gt; already did.  I didn't think they would be that much...I shoulda
&gt; asked...good thing I only got 2....
&gt; I got 6 for the fronts so I can do all of them...and still have 2 spares
&gt; for later...or someone else.
&gt; The fronts are made by Varga and have the dust boot, and another little
&gt; 0 shaped seal in them...and the rears are made by ATE and come in a nice
&gt; little box with 2 dust boots, 2 other seals, and instructions for
&gt; rebuilding even!  Made in the UK.  Vargas are made in Brazil...
&gt; We'll see how the rebuilds go.
&gt; I have about 500 miles on the 62 by the way...  I'm having a blast with
&gt; the thing.  I drove it from Oshkosh to Shawano to see my grandma...and
&gt; then to Green Bay to see some other relatives....they got a kick out of
&gt; it.  I've been driving 55-60 the whole time...more along the lines of
&gt; 55...and slower at night when there is no traffic :)
&gt; Ever hear of a 16 year old driving under the speed limit?  ;-)
