Subject: Re: [VB] Replacing Steering box on my '60 DD

I have a  good replacement box for my bus.  I purchased a pulman arm 
puller  today.  I got the pullman arm off no problem.  When I install the  
replacement, how can I make sure that the box is in the center.  Does  
this make sense?
-- 




when I pulled the pitman off for some reason, I noticed that there  were dots 
on the pitman arm and on the spline where they line up.    Clean them up and 
look carefully.  one has two dots, the other one, and the  one dot goes 
between the two, look from the end of the spline thing sticking out  of the SGBox
