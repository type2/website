Okay everyone, I didn't drive the bus to work today because I don't feel the
engine is really ready for any more miles until I get some kinks worked out
of it.  I'm asking for tips, advice, and anything I can grab onto to help me
out on these last few little bugs.

First off, the valve thing.  I'm running dual springs and I intend to keep
them on there.  I rev my engine when I drive - maybe not to the point I need
duals, but I have been told that the bigger valves require more pressure
than stock to keep them from bouncing and doing little valve no-no's while
cruising around.

As for valve geometry - I'm totally convinced that I'm off.  In my last
minute rush to get to BNNTA, I threw on stuff and didn't check it.  It's not
WAY out of whack but it ain't perfect.  With the engine in the bus, just
exactly HOW do I know other than from just &quot;LOOKING&quot; whether my geometry is
set right?  Is there a tool, guage, homemade reference gizmo that I can use
to check this?  With my swivel foot adjustors and the heads being spaced out
.040&quot; from the cylinders, it almost appears to me that I need longer than
stock pushrods to correct the geometry but I could be mistaken.  I'll take
any tips in this area because my knowledge of what to do is ZERO.

Secondly, I'm leaking oil like crazy.  It took 4 quarts to do 350 miles and
that was traced to no oring on the dizzy but I'm still loosing it.  Some is
from the deep sump and that can be cured by putting a better gasket on
between the engine and sump.  I had to use a marginal one before because I
ran out of time.  I'm getting oil from behind the pulley for sure because it
drips right down on the merged part of the header and you can see each blue
puff from each drip while driving around town.  I also am going to replace
the gaskets under the fuel pump and alternator stand with some thicker
material because it is wet directly beneath these areas.  The area under the
dizzy is bone dry now that it has the o-ring in place.  I my pushrod tubes
are dry as well - they are permatexed in place.

I know for a fact that my slinger washer is in correctly.  I made it a point
to put it on right as I was told that screwing up here can cause you to have
to totally disassemble the engine again.  I didn't want that so I stepped
lightly and got it right.  I'm wondering if my stock breather setup is not
enough and I'm forcing oil out from behind the pulley.  I currently have the
stock breather vented into each of my dual carbs.  Will further venting from
the valve covers to the carbs help me any?  I was also told that an oversize
pulley may be required and yet another person told me just to sand seal the
case.  Still another one greatly encouraged me to NOT sand seal the case -
almost pleading with me not to.

The oil is misting around the engine compartment so bad, it drips off of the
coil, alternator, etc.  I'm wondering if the vaccuum in the engine
compartment with the vented decklid (on my 67 bus) causes any oil leaked to
go flying around on it's way back to the fan and then gets deposited
enroute?

Thanks for the tips.  I'll treat them like printed gold and go tackle some
more problems.

I've still got my rims and tires up for sale or trade.  Thanks!
