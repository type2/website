Subject: why so many different exhausts?

 Kinda joining this discussion a bit late, sorry, but,
 I have a stock VW muffler, single outlet on left side (driver's. stock
 location), larger than the bus mufflers I have, made in Germany, and was
 told that it was from late model Super Beetles. The outlet is like a bug in
 that you have to clamp a pipe to it.  Maybe a compromise between larger
 aftermarket and 'wimpy' stock.
