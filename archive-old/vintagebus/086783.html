Subject: Bosch Distributor Rebuild Kits?

Any one here have a source for the steel and fibre washer/shims for
rebuilding Bosch distributors?  I know I can buy a fancy new chrome 009
from just about anywhere, but I'm trying to rebuild the original vacuum
model that came with '67 buses.

Rumblings have it that Bosch used to sell rebuild kits but got out of
that business years ago (except perhaps for S**b distributors for some
reason).  The Hoover sermons talk about rebuilding distributors but cite
the scarcity of shims as a problem.  I did a search on &quot;bosch rebuild
kits&quot; and found only parts for Bosch tools.  Nothing 40 years old.  

I also searched through the Grainger online catalog and found some
generic washer shims that might work.  How can they justify a price of
$10 per washer?  Do I just have to cannibalize a new 009 for washers to
get end play back within reason and seal out the oil?

Any leads will be appreciated...and may end up as the subject of an
article for NEATO's Old Bus Review.
