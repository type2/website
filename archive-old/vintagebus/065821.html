&gt; I managed to bend the tab, but have not managed to move the clip at all.  I

&gt; remove them?

Hi Paul,
Hmm, are you sure you are attacking the wider side of the slide on 
locks/clamps?

&gt; Next question is about the torsion leaves - should I remove the grease from
&gt; them or just bag them up as they are whilst the beam is powdercoated?

Leave them greased for now.  They are a higher carbon steel so will rust 
easily if not coated with grease.

&gt; Powdercoating - whilst looking in the archives I spotted a handy tip about 
&gt; using two long pieces of thread all to hold rubber and wood at either end 
&gt; to prevent the sand going into the torsion tubes.  What should I do about 
&gt; the grease nipples?

Best to find new zerk fittings and install them.  These will be grease free 
so will not bleed grease about when heated and ruin the powdercoating.

&gt; Last question now - I disconnected the link that goes from the steering box 
&gt; to the swivel pin at the swivel pin end.   However the link has a lot of 
&gt; side to side movement - I can push it into and pull out from the steering 
&gt; box quite a distance - is this normal?

Hmm, not sure what you are talking about there.  You might want to look at 
the bus parts manual on the Obsolete AC Documents website for proper 
nomenclature.

&gt; Whilst on the subject I am glad I decided to take it apart - one of the link 
&gt; pins was so badly worn I was surprised there wasn't more movement than 
&gt; there was.  Old grease had clogged up I think and was preventing it from 
&gt; being greased at all. 

We have seen this over and over again!  All due to gunked up old grease from 
not religiously greasing the front beam every 3,000 miles.  We take all link 
pins apart and clean them thoughly when we get a new to us set on a parts 
beam or complete bus.
