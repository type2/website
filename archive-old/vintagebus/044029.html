Oh Yea!!!!!!  I think I've seen that one!!!!!!  It's where the swat guys
shoot the tear gas container thru the windshield, right?  And then when
the occupants come falling out the doors, coughing...they get surrounded
and stomped on, clubbed and cuffed right?  And then they are frisked, body
cavity searched and read their rights and taken to the hospitalso thier
injuries can be treated and the driver dies right?
yea, I've seen that one too......I think I saw them filming that episode
up at the American/Canadian border!
later
