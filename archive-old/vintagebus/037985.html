 into another &quot;war of words&quot; on the lists, everyone knows we've had plenty of 
 those.  &gt;&gt;


John,

You have not offended me. I think your post was in good taste and certainly 
not SPAM. There are other dealers on the list who do a lot more promotion 
then you do. I guess any list member who offers a service to other members or 
posts something for sale is guilty of SPAM, huh?
