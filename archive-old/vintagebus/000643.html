&lt;&lt;Will an original abarth clear the rear bumper in my 57 bus?
Guess I wont find out till the motors done and installed......but that could

I have a very old 4 tip muffler made by BRUTON BIG BORE.  It fits under my 58 
bus rear apron just fine.
the repop abarth style mufflers do go down then out.  a friend has one on a 
59 bug, abd the holes in his rear apron have been filled in for that &quot;clean&quot; 
look.
