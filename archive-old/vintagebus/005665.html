Subject: [VB] CB in a bus

Well I actually got a good deal on eBay and scored a vintage-looking Royce
CB radio that actually works for less than it cost to get shipped :-)

I'd like to mount it in my Kombi.  The Kombi is beat all to hell and back so
I don't mind cutting holes wherever to put stuff in..._but_ eventually when
I retire the Kombi I'll transplant the rig into the Westy.  So my questions
are:

What's the best way to mount this sucker in a bus?  I have it sitting in the
parcel tray right now.  I don't want to put it in the dash as I plan on
putting an AM/FM radio in there.

What's a good CB antenna to mount on the front of the bus?  I'd like
something that's not too tall (as to not look silly and/or cause clearance
probs), provides good performance for the price, and doesn't require a hole
much larger than for a regular antenna.  I'd rather not use a magnetic
rooftop antenna.  The Westy already has an antenna on it so I won't be
making any new holes.  The hole in the Kombi is bondoed over so I'll just
take a screwdriver and knock it out ;-)

Thanks for any help!
