When you talk about fit, do you mean the front or rear?



I've only put these on the front...



Thom and I took the fronts off in Sacramento and it had (worn) 215's at the

time.  Don't remember anything special about it.  I do nice the fit is tight

at the back of the front wheel well.



As for the rear -- 215's were on there when I purchased the Truck.  I've had

no reason to pull them yet, but you and I can find out next weekend :)

I meant fit front and rear, I guess.    The fit is pretty close on my 61 (205
75 15 tires), which has a narrower arch that the later ones.  The flare in the
rear lets the tire be a bit wider there, and also the arch was changed in the
front, but fit, or lack thereof, is probably more noticable in the rear
particularly when taking them off/putting them on,  as the arch is lower
(unless the wheel wells are hacked and you can then put monster tires on it)
Eric thought you would have to deflate 205 to put them on an early arch bus,
and was surprised when I said they go on my 61, but I know he and Barb ran
wider/bigger tires on their  early wheel arch bus for a while, and I got the
impression they had to be somewhat deflated to get them on, then inflated
while on.  Idea being to get the speed up w/o excessive rpmage.  

  I had a parts bus about 10 years ago that slid on ice and hit a tree (the
driver got away with a wrenched wrist) and the drivers front wheel arch was
mushed in so bad.  I wanted the tires and wheels for my 59 (which had 15&quot; bug
rims/tires that were junk on it).  I let air out of the tire, pulled it off,
let air out of the tire on thebug rim to replace it, put that on, and rolled
it a block to the gas station, put air in it, rolled it home, and had a nice
set of 14&quot; wheels/tires for my 59.   It handled a lot better.   I think there
was metal showing in one of the old tires.
