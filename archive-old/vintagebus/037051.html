&lt;&lt; Last summer I was sitting in the Dusseldorf airport on my way back from 
Bad 
 Camberg.  As I was waiting, I was looking at the video I had shot over the 
 weekend when a guy in his early 20's asked me what I had shot. When I told 
 him it was of a VW show, he told me that he had a '65 barndoor. After I 
asked 
 him a few questions it  turns out he had a '65 double door.  &quot;Naw man, it's 
 called a barndoor when they have doors on both sides, they are really rare.&quot; 
 I showed him footage of barndoors and double doors, and explained the 
 difference, but he still insisted. I thought it was funny that I was leaving 
 VW mecca and there is this kid telling me everything I know is wrong. &gt;&gt;


 I have met more than one individual who have had buses in the past who 
called splittys barndoors cause the cargo doors open up on hinges &quot;like barn 
doors&quot;.  Even an older German guy who had a bus in the late fifties.   It's 
all a matter of terminology and since we are the bus folks who dribble on 
about buses and agree that a &quot;barndoor bus&quot; is the pre March 55 kind, doesn't 
mean that everyone knows our codes.  I mean, who thought up that word anyway, 
 it really isn't so descriptive.  Splitty is descriptive, its a split wind 
sheild bus.  It makes sense.  Barn doors dont open up like a barndoor engine 
lid.   they tend to hinge out like splitty cargo doors, unless they have 
newer ones that slide like sliding cargo doors.

I guess barndoor is a big catchword, hm.      People get annoyed at me for 
saying some parts aren't 'barndoor' only, they are used through mid 56 or 
whatever, cause they love calling something barndoor, the magic word , whooo 
hoooooooooo.

think I'll put some barndoor air in my barndoor's low tire.
