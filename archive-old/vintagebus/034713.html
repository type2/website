Hi NQ,
You might want to mention the exact size of pistons you have now that is 
stamped on the pistons.  All ACVW pistons and cylinders not only come in 75, 
77, 83, 85 mm, and so on sizes, but each of these have three slight bore size 
differances in each set of P&amp;C sizes.  In other words a slightly small bore, 
a nominal bore and slight overbore.  If you install the slightly small bore 
pistions in the slightly overbore cylinders you will have too much piston 
slap.  Visa versa you have large bore pistons that if they can be squeezed in 
small bore cylinders, will sieze up when they get up to operating temp due to 
aluminum expanding faster than cast iron!   Eric&amp;Barb
