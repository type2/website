That being the case how do we know that VW (or the original copyright
holder) hadn't let the copyright lapse on the old manuals?  I don't think
that you can rule out that possibility.  Another point, maybe someone should
ask VW if they give a crap about someone copying out of print manuals.  The
way I see it there is a definite difference between copying a manual, which
is a tool, and reproducing artwork, parts, etc. with the VW logo.

Notice the 3rd sentence.  Looks like Thom's got another 28 years to
wait... legally anyway.  If you'd like to see the complete text of this
FAQ I found, you can see it here:

http://www.faqs_dot_org/faqs/law/copyright/faq/part2/

The copyright act of 76 basically got rid of the renewal clause that
used to force copyright holders to renew or loose their copyrights.
Interesting, but just a tad on the dry side.
