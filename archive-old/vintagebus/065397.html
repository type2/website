&gt; I'm running at about 3500 RPM at 70.  I don't have much left to pass with,
&gt; but my bus is currently running a somewhat tired 1600 sp.

Hmmm, my '71 would be just about topped out at 70 and I've a feeling that
it would be turning quite a bit more than 3500RPM.  Are you sure that your
speedometer is reading correctly?  Mine reads about 70MPH when I'm really
going 62 (and it's more accurate than the one I replaced!  :)
