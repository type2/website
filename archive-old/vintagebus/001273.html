Subject: Re: [VB] Help me lern....Binz????

&gt; Just what is a binz? I know this may sound like a dumb question, but if I don't ask, I will never know. Any one have a photo. I went to ebay looking for the one you mentioned but could not find it.
&gt; 
Not a dumb question!

One of the best examples was one now residing in New Hampshire, pictured on Page 1 of my DoubleCabs page:
http://thesamba_dot_com/vw/type2/photos/photosdoublecabs.htm

Basically, a Binz is a Volkswagen Double Cab produced before &quot;formal&quot; Double Cab production began during 1959.  It is a custom vehicle made from a factory-delivered Single Cab. It has several unique features, among them the back seat, the shortened side gates, custom windows for the passenger area, the rear door, and the partition between the front and rear seats.  It also is the only VW truck to have belly pans installed, similar to a Sunroof Bus.  More info in the Archives:

So go find me one and I'll give you my Ambulance step!  :)
