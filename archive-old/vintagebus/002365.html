 Lost your email address. After comparing a known early bus single exhaust
tip with the one I got at KP, the KP one is 2 inches longer than the known
ribbed bumper one. Rarest of the rare 1959 36 hp only tip ??? It's yours for
what I paid for it plus shipping if you still need it, otherwise it goes to
Hot VW's for the vintage issue. Or is it a early bug tip and not a bus??
Parts book lists only one style.

See you all in Prescott May 19,20 and Christmas tree island in June.

John ( butt healed ) Howard.
