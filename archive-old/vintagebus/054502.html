Subject: Re: [VB] Torque hub king nut to 650 ft-lbs+++ /Antisieze


Jim,

I've heard this on and off over the years too. Yet I've not had any
problems with anything treated this way. Nothing falls apart or breaks,
and removal is a relative cinch.

So I really can't say, but this old bus is running just fine.

&gt; Aren't torque specifications usually for &quot;dry, clean

&gt; lubricate the threads and make it easier to stretch
&gt; the bolt, in effect over tightening the fastener with
&gt; the same amount of torque? (I recall that I have put
&gt; antisieze on these kinds of fasteners mayself.)
&gt; Can some one out there clarify this?
