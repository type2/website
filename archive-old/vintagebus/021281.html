It was great. Good friends, good weather, good music, great location. How's
that for short?
Hope someone will fill in the details. :-)

Took my 85 year young dad in *his* bus along with my 9 year old daughter
&quot;Tootsie&quot;. My dad loved it and those there treated him to tours of their
busses. Everyone made a point to explain all the features on the different
years to him and made him feel welcome. To those there: A great big thanks
&gt;from me and my dad!

The 69 behaved beautifully and ran like a champ, and loved the cool air.
Finished the valve adjustment and new MC just before the trip. I was so
happy, I bought her a new rear bumper at Farmington.

A note: Judy did an outstanding job of providing raffle items for the event.
All the kids got a prize. In the future I will always bring something to
throw in to the raffle pool. If everyone did this it would be great at these
events. A real big thanks to Judy!!

Thanks Chris!
