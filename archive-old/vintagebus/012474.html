Hi Ken,
We would suggest having the type 3 tranny modified for freeway flier for
the
bus with reduction boxes.  Will keep your stock height, stock rear wheel
bearings setup, and saves you the cost of the lowering job.  Which
lowering is
costly if you want to do it safely.  If you are interested in lowering we
suggest the Wolfgang lowering kit using CV setup.  If you are interested
in
more info for the modified tranny we would be happy to p-mail it to you.

******************************************************************************************
While that in the weeds look might play well with the local surf scene I
am somewhat ambivalent to the thought of lowering my Kombie. It will
never be a show Queen or any such stuff.
having gone into the guardrail 70 miles outside of san antonio (Black
ice)I'm interested in better handling not ride height. around here the
speeds hardly ever get up to what you would get on a mainland freeway.
it's just that i'm thinking about taking it to the farm in Mo. from San
Jose CA and back before i put it on the boat home. It's got a fresh 1.5K
mi. 1600 SP in it now.
I have a balanced  1600 SP w/  a mild cam and a set of dual kadrons or a
28 pci w/o venturi and headers in my bug that I could swap into the bus
but not right away.
I drove the Kombie from FL to CA were it waits for me to ship it to
Hawaii.
The scarriest part of the trip was not the breakdowns but the lack of
power.
my 69 Westy didn't have this problem and it had a SP 1600as well...

Ccould I run 15&quot; rims and stay out of the big rigs way more effectively?


 

Aloha

Ken

be acceptable in thy sight, O LORD, my strength and my redeemer.&quot;
