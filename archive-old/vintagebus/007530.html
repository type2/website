&gt;  Anyway the extractor bolt holes dont match up with the dualport intake
&gt; manifold at the heat riser tubes, so icant bolt it together, im wondering
&gt;if can &quot;afford&quot;  the real deal muffler???????
&gt; any comments/warnings  would be appreciated, i really dont want to cause
&gt;any damage to my new engine
&gt;

You'll probably not damage the engine.
 
I've been in a similar situation. Running a big engine with dual carbs and no heat risers to bolt up at all. 

I simply cut the mounting flanges off the exhaust and welded up the hole. Don't worry about the intake side leaking, it won't. You are going to replace this exhaust any way. You have gotten more than your $50.00 out of it.  Weld it up.
