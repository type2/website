I just got back from an adventure in the foothills of Moscow, Idaho.  My
buddy informed earlier today that he had seen on the side of the road an
&quot;old VW bus with the small back window.&quot;  I instantly thought pre-1960!
We went up there and found the beast.  It was even better than I had
imagined!  It was so complete that it even had all four hub caps!  The
newest registration on the plates read 1979.  Oh, yah, and I almost
forgot.  It's a Westy with the flip-top on the passenger side.  Just like
the one that Thom purchased a few months ago.  I tried talking to the
owner of the land tonight, but couldn't locate him.  I did find out who
owned it and got a phone number, so I'll keep you posted on what happens.
By the way, what was the last year that they used the flip-top on the
Westfalias?
