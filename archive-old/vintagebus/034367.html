Hi all,

Deanna Larsen has drawn to my attention that Alan
Schofield lists cargo beds for pickups.........

The listing is:

Part No.    18C    P5    Pickup Bed.......(complete)...(not illustrated)
296 pounds 

I think that would roughly translate to around US$600.  So,
these sections may be available to you US'ers
through Ronnie.

I may put my plans back on hold - I thought pickup
cargo bed panels were not available anywhere.

&gt; if it was thick metal like original and in the correct pattern i'd be all
&gt; over it like flies on the proverbial.  yesterday the professional bus
&gt; cutter
&gt; &lt;shudder&gt; and i went to look at the bed on that '60 single cab.
