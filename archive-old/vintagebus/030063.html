Well there are the people who just take an extra long stare as they past
on the inside lane and then the ones who want to stop and talk to me
about it. Then there's the ones who I see in the side mirrors with their
hands in the air just plain going &quot;what the F*%K&quot; cause they don't see
the signals or brake lights in the usual spots.

All in all it has been a little different than my other buses. But I
definitely know your point most people don't pay attention.

&gt; Man that happens to me all the time. I dont think regular, everyday joe
&gt; drivers, know your bus is different. They see them all the same.
