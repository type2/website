 Any ideas as to what they Wanna Be?.

 

 Different from the rest of &quot;society&quot;, brother. Look at your nearest &quot;non-corporate&quot; mall for the latest in drop-out fashion garb. I think there is a &quot;kit&quot; being offered for just a few hundred dollars. Comes with a tye-dye by Diesel, birks, Hillfiger cargo shorts, hemp bracelets via Abercrombie, Amazon discount card for the latest GD &quot;Dick's Pick's&quot; or Dave Matthews cd's, and a pot leaf hat by Calvin Kline. Oh, you can get pretty well done up in the latest Punk Rock fashions too only a few racks over! :)
