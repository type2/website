&gt; &quot;How do I positively identify the size of the engine so I can get the 
&gt; correct parts?&quot; I've found but a few parts and add-ons/upgrades for the 1800. 
&gt; Would it be wise to replace it with a 1600?

Hi Angus,
Probably as others have already said that you need to ID the engine case 
first!  As far as figuring out EXACT engine size you would have to remove a 
cylinder head and measure/read piston size and measure stroke to get cc size of 
engine.
