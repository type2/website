i have heard from some other net sources that VW will be unveiling a new 
Micro at the Detroit International Auto Show on January 8th. i have been 
quite excited about it!! i will definately be attending. i dont know if 
there are New Beetle fans on this list, but i am and my wife has one. if the 
new Micro captures the look our busses like the New Beetle, ill be the first 
to throw down my deposit. i have read things like a sliding ragtop sunroof, 
45mpg TDI, 4-Motion (all-wheel drive) and of course a Westfalia. sounds 
good. i know everyone will be b|tching about how its going to be $20k.... 
but thats just what stuff costs these days. at least Volkswagen is making 
money. Olds is phasing out... Ford is cutting back... Buick??? as a fan of 
H20 VW's since i drove a 16V GTI at 14, life is good! i sure am glad i got 
my first air-cooled a couple years ago though, busses are the best. and it 
sure is great having you guys (girls) to be there to lend a helping hand.
thanks for reading my rambles... Happy New Year!!!
