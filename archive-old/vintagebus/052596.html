Subject: Re: [VB] Oil Cooler Block Off Plate



&gt; I am installing an oil cooler block off plate, and I have a few 
questions I 
&gt; hope some of you can help me with.  First, let me describe the plate:
&gt; 
&gt; It is a flat plate with a U-shaped hump for the flow-through tube.  
The 
&gt; &quot;hump&quot; has a hex-plug that provides access to the flow-through 
chamber.
&gt; 
&gt; Now, the questions:
&gt; 
&gt; 1. Why is there a plug here rather than having a solid U-shaped hump 
for the 
&gt; pass through?

Some like to tap into the oil system here for a cooler or filter.

&gt; 2. What is the likelihood of this plug leaking, and other than teflon 
tape 
&gt; and lock tight, how do I insure that it doesn't leak or even come out?

Safety wire means never having to say you're sorry.

For leaking, I wouldn't use teflon tape.  Better to use some sort of 
fuel and oil proof sealant like hylomar.

&gt; 3.  Should I screw in this plug all of the way until it bottoms out, 
or 
&gt; should I screw it in only part way to avoid blocking off part of the 
oil 
&gt; flow?

Is it a tapered thread?  If so, screw it in until snug.

&gt; 4. Is there perhaps another block off I should be using?  (i.e. is 
this 
&gt; design a little faulty or are there better block-offs I should be 
using)

I question the use of a block-off at all.  What is wrong with the stock 
oil cooler?  Unless you have built a monster engine, the stock oil 
cooler should be more than adequate.  Hard to beat a multi-layer fan-
forced cooler.
