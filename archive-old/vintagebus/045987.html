&lt;&lt; Well as far as we know Westfalia never made a hitch for the bug.  As for
the bus one it has a round bar running front to rear where it bends upward and
suddenly has a ball on the end. &gt;&gt;

Hi Eric and Barb,
   I know what a Westfalia hitch looks like, that is why when I saw that on
the beetle, I asked the list about it! It is round, and it does suddenly have
a ball on it. And since you say they didnt make them to your knowledge, they
must be really rare? As for the lug nuts I am no longer running the bus ones,
but now have beetle brakes and lugs.
