I just recieved a restored set of ambulance fans from Bob Vega (empi_at_aol_dot_com)
and they look great!  He knows his stuff.  They came packaged and sealed,
cleanly primered and tagged for proper installation.  Very professional.  He
sells these fans for $250 (shipping in continental US included, insurance
extra) and they are worth every penny!  Give him an email at empi_at_aol_dot_com for
more complete information.
Thanks Bob,
Dan Morris
