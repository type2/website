Subject: Re: [VB] Double Cab Bed Floors, and Double Cab parts Help.

In addition to what has already been mentioned, there are also:

1.  Doublecab-sized wood bedslats (if you're going for the original
look)
2.  3 interior trim panels for the backseat area
3.  Some of the masonite headliner pieces may be unique to the DC
4.  Hold-down brackets, bolts, and wing nuts for the rear seat base
5.  You should have 2 dome lights (sometimes one is missing), and an
ashtray in the back seat area.

&gt; I might be able to get a toasted Double cab in some horse, er VW trading,
&gt; but it has NO bed.  All of the supports are there, but the top is gone.
&gt; Does anyone make a panel for this?
&gt; 
&gt; Also what other Double Cab only parts should it have?
