Guys, and Gals.. That flipping over thing was a joke... Come on now.. Trying 
to put a smile on all our faces...

Donald, build your bus the way YOU want... Thats what we should all do.  
Don't let people sway you... There are lots of Vintage guys out there with 
what they call &quot;stock&quot;  early type II's that have 1600's in them.  Not too 
many type II's remain that are truly original or totally stock.

John
