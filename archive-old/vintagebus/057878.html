Subject: Re: [VB] bus electrical probs.

Yeah, I just brought my '60 DC home and there's no brake lights. I mean there
just gone; ie: never were! As in, didn't get any. Well, I didn't buy it for the
lights anyway.

&gt; My brake lights don't work. where do I start? i do have a wiring diagram
&gt; from tom's site, seems that all the wires are hooked up correctly. now what?
&gt; is it in the master cylinder? sure don't want to have to buy another one of
&gt; those. Also, my turn signals blink very fast. Everynow and then it will
&gt; blink at the proper speed, but not very often. wonder what is wrong there?
&gt; I want to be able to hook my radio up so it will come on when the switch
&gt; comes on, and also when i camp i'd like another way to flip it on. I was
&gt; wondering if i just ran a hot wire up and put a switch on it, so i could use
&gt; it when i want, will the wire that goes back to the ignition coil be hot
&gt; when i flip the switch? I know that sounds confusing, but i did find a wire
&gt; on my 67 that turns hot when the key is on. so i used it for my accesory.
&gt; but if i put another hot wire up from the battey and put a switch inline,
&gt; when this wire is hot, it will also be sending current to the accesory wire
&gt; which defeats the purpose correct?
&gt; sorry for all the danm questions. i'm trying to figure out this vw.
&gt; peace
