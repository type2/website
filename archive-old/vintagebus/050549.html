 &gt;Also, my wipers run R-E-A-L s-l-o-w.   I believe the PO (took me a
 &gt;while to figure out that acronym!) didn't convert the wiper motor to
 &gt;12v when he converted it.  What is the recommendation?  Should I put a 
 &gt;&quot;reducer&quot; on it and run the existing wiper motor, and will it help the
 &gt;speed?  Or is there another option?  How difficult is this?
 
 Typically if you keep the 6v wiper motor when you convert to 12v, the
 6v motor spins really really fast...until it burns out.  I think it's
 more likely that the gearbox on the end of the wiper motor is full of
 old grease, or the wiper blade axles are rusted up, etc.  Or maybe
 the brushes in the wiper motor need replacement. 
 ------ 
ditto on that,   cleaning out the grease and replacing with fresh really 
helps.     Can make not working wiper motors work, and also quiet noisy ones.
............................
 You might look at the '65 wiring diagram on vintagebus_dot_com and make
 sure the switch and motor are hooked up right.  Your Bus should have
 the two-speed motor and switch, which is more wires for the PO to
 get hooked up wrong.
 ---------------------
er- no- 65 has a one year only one speed wiper motor that is self parking.
.........................
 &gt;Brings up another point, my hazards don't blink.  The big red 
 &gt;light left of the steering column comes on steady.  Is this a
 &gt;6v-12v related problem? 
 
 It could be.  Your Bus would originally have been equipped with a
 6v hazard and turn signal flasher (also known as the &quot;9 prong box&quot;).
 This should have been changed out for a 12v version but probably
 wasn't.  The PO may have replaced it with a generic 3-terminal flasher
 which means the turn signals will work but not the hazards.  
 -------------------
no again, 65 does NOT have the 9 prong box.  The 9 prong box is a 66-67 
thing.   The 6 came with a three prong flasher for the turn signals, and a 4 
prong flasher for the e- lights on the right hand side.   My 65 has a 12 V 
version in it.  But before assuming you have a 6V/12V problem, you could try 
cleaning up all the connectiond (or at least wiggling them) and checking to 
see if the light bulbs are still good.

........................................
 The original flashers are prominently marked with their voltages.
 Turn on the turn signal and follow the clicking sound.  You'll probably
 find a little round metal or plastic can with two or three connections,
 next to a bigger metal or plastic box with nine connections, some of
 them unhooked.  If the bigger box is marked '6V', that's the old flasher
 that the PO has bypassed. 
 
 The &quot;Troubleshooting&quot; section of
 http://www.type2_dot_com/library/electris/vw-9prong.html will tell you more
 about the flasher system on your Bus.
 
 Good luck! &gt;&gt;
