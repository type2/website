The only problem I see is that even though we're talking about a straight
points system here, I would still imagine some people would be saying &quot;ah
that guy never liked me anyways...that's why he scored me low on that&quot;. You
would need to have the Concours class be it's own class. And people
entering it would fully understand the ramifications.

The benefit of a points system is that a really nice panel van could beat
out a little bit less nice 54 deluxe! That might be fun to see...I think it
really evens the playing field.

I would say that the scorecards should be available before the events (is
that true for other Concours's?) I don't think there's anything proprietary
on them, right? It's essentially the ultimate &quot;Progressive Refinements&quot;
list. Also, what value does cleanliness play? I mean, does an original part
that's a little road-worn get less points than a bad repo that's in mint
condition?

Of course, we need to make sure we get a COMPLETE list of M-Codes before we
even think about starting this. I still haven't seen that anywhere.

I nominate Greg Noble to be a judge, by the way...he's pretty merciless on
originality.
