high teens around town seems fine.   straight freeway driving  milage in the 
low to mid twenties also seems average.   I find my freeway milage is better 
when I drive at 2500-3K rpms, or on winding hilly roads, especially on hot 
days.

a thourough tune up with new ignition cap rotor points etc does help
