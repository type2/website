so you switched to dual carbs and this new breather/filter set up?     I'd
try removing the breather set up and see whta happens.   That sounds like a lot of oil coming out of there.    how lng is the tube on there?   of course,
it will spray oil if not connected to something.  what year is the bus?   hm.

&gt;&gt;I &quot;seem&quot; to have fixed the problem--I did the old classic two things at once so I don't know which worked.  1) I had put a CB performance internal sump oil filter in; some people said this could cause a problem.  CB and a local VW shop said no, they hadn't heard of any problems with them.  I took it out anyhow and 2) instead of running my crank outlet hose into a small carb vacuum, I tapped a 3/8&quot; nub right into the manifold and ran the hose into that.  I definitely have positive pressure now!!  My problem seems fixed....I just wish I knew what the actual cure was and if I now could have too much vacuum on the outlet hose????  Ever hear anything about those filters--it was kind of expensive and looked like a great idea.  I don't mean to badmouth CB but it doesn't seem I added that much extra vacuum and suddenly removing the filter and problem solved ????  Makes ya wonder.
