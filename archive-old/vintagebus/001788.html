Howdy folks -
I think the time has come for a new steering box for my '67 Deluxe.
I have been having *terrible* steering play with my bus for awhile now. Not
just annoyingly loose, but down right bad!

I took my bus in to a VW dealer to have new tires mounted, they tried to be
helpful and make an adjustment trying to tighten-up the play in the steering
wheel - all it did was to cause the steering to stick in the corners and not
return on it's own.
Not helpful. I made them 'unfix' it.

I have reviewed through my plethora of repair paperwork that the PO supplied
me with and discovered that both tie rod assemblies were replaced (incl.
steering drag link arm) not too long ago. It may be possible that they
weren't installed correctly or they have nothing to do with the problem at
all.

I am not certain if busses have 'king pins' but I remember an old truck that
I used to drive had similar problems w/ the king-pin being the culprit. Can
I get rebuilt or new steering boxes or is this a junk-yard dive sort of
deal?

In addition there are times when it feels like the tires track together well
enough while I am making a turn but on the straight-a-way, it feels like the
aren't tracking together. But it's hard to tell if it is due to a steering
problem or a wheel problem. Are there any good ways to narrow this down?

I would appreciate some helpful hints on this.
thanks
-melissa
