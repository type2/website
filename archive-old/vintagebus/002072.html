Volks:

Replaced the tranny in my '62 with a freeway flyer. (BTW - Everyone raves
about these things, but I didn't notice much difference.  Anyone know how to
check the gearing to confirm I got what I paid for?)  I'm fairly proficient
in the &quot;shop,&quot; and other than wanting death over trying to get the wheel
bearings off without a puller, the job went off OK...  Until....

Whenever I hit a decent bump, or jerk the clutch, there is this hideous
knock in back, reminiscent of when the nose cone mounting bolts came loose
on my bug...  The shocks are old, could this have anything to do with it?
What about the rubber tranny mounts on the undercarriage?  Any thoughts are
appreciated: it's one of those noises that you know is nothing to fix now,
but will cost you $$ in the future if you don't address.  Dig?

Thanks,
Adam
