Barndoors are like that, all my fill and drain bolts for the tranny and
redux boxes use those.  I don't know when it stopped, wouldn't surprise me
if all split cases were like that...

If the bolts are nice, I could use them.  A couple of mine are pretty beat,
I have use an crescent wrench instead of a socket.

My parts book says all 55-63 redux box outers are the same part # so you
should be ok to use it.

 I have a spare 36mm small nut tranny I was pullin parts off of including a
 Redux box half, and I noticed it had 19mm bolt head fill plugs. Not a big
 deal but not the typicall 17mm *allen* head bolts I'm used to. so the Q is,
 Is this from a different year (splitcase?),  or is it a 63 only 1 ton redux
 half ? I know its a 36mm tranny, but i just want to make sure this half
will
 be ok to use. both sides top and bottom have this plug.

 Dont even know if you can fit a 63 redux half on an earlier tranny, but i
 wanted to make sure.
