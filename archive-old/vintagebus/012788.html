Patching holes . . fascinating already . . :-)

There is a lot of data on doing this job right . as in
welding in a proper patch and yada yada . .

What if you live in one of those Nazi apartment complexes
 . .? you whip out a torch and he whips out your eviction.

What if you're 200 miles off Ecuador and there's &quot;greenies&quot;
coming over both sides . .?

I have this hole, a couple inches or more round in the
left fender of my van . . the A/C hoses . .

So we will no-weld fix this error . .

At the Flaps . . any flaps, they sell decorative aluminum
strip for taping on your 4WD trashy stuff . . it's like
.020 thick and a couple inches wide . . self stick . .

This jobs almost done . .

Another source of easy worked metal is the roofing section
of your other local friendly . . flashing . .

About .030&quot; thick and 6&quot; or 12&quot; wide by some feet long . .

Take a piece of the metal . . aluminum is easy . .
they have galvanized steel or even copper . .

Get your rubber mallet and warp the metal over the fender
in the area to be patched to get the contour . .

Hold it over the hole on the inside while you reach outside
under the fender with your longest arm and trace a line
thru the hole on the metal . . :-)

Now you cut that piece out . .

If you warped a big enough section, just cut a piece to go
clear over the hole with about an inch overlap all the
way around . .

Axiom: Make your overlap equal to the size of the hole
until it gets ridiculous . .

So you have one piece that overlaps the hole and one that
fits the hole . .

Clean the metal and the area around the hole . . rough it.

Get some of your favorite epoxy, slather it on the big patch
and slap it on the inside of the hole . . prop it in there
with your wife while you go outside and stick the hole-sized
patch in against the other one . .

Now the two of you hold that there till it sets . .

Now your clean patch filling the hole should almost fill
the depression . .

You could use a little body putty . . a water-proof type
to fill the line and any remaining depression  of the
hole . . I'd rather you didn't tho . .

Now that is cleaned up of any excess epoxy etc.  .
get a can  of that undercoating and go over the whole area
out under the fender . . finish will obviously vary with
where you are putting this patch . .

The philosophy here is that it is better to patch than
to put it off for years because you can't &quot;do it right&quot;.

The second need I have is leave some evidence that it is
a temp patch . . only seen if you look for it but there.

Bob  Hoover has mentioned the most expedient patch . .
the side out of a beer can slathered with RTV  . .

This is not for you yuppy scum tho . . more like patching
bullet holes in the side of the van when you got 800 miles
more before you get out of that miserable cold Montana.

Freedom fighten' is one thing but cold freedom fighten'
is quite another . .  :-)

I have another patch, I think on the end of my heater
channel . . like the end has rusted out into a square
hole . .

I would not like to do this one except the right way but
it's  still better than leaving it an open wound , ,

Take a piece of that flashing and make a box section . .
Cut a notch in the corners of a square and fold up the
edges . .

If you made this the right size for the square hole,it
will slide in there and grip the walls of the square tube.

That is also the bond lap-joint so slather on your
favorite  . . . .

To get a good bond joint, you need to clean the areas to
be bonded with all the care of a surgeon . .

Rough the area to be bonded . . within the rules of above .
I get my grinder on the thing . . real rough . .
The epoxy etc. gets a grip on that rough tooth . .

Now the real important part . . the thinnest bond line
is the strongest bond line . . so clamp it . .

Stop whining . . you can too clamp it . . get a 2x4 and
brace it against the patch . . get a wedge in on the end .
Piece of cake . .  :-)

You can clamp by using fasteners . . rivets . . screws
take them out later and fill the screw holes . .

Sometimes . . like most of the time you have to massage
the shape or size . . so you make a pattern out of card-
stock . . the side of a cereal box . .

Get it like you want it  . . . then transfer your pattern
to the metal . .

One thing with the card-stock . . I cut out this box I want,
now if I had a flange here and here I could just fold this
over this . . . so you just tape a piece of card-stock
where you want it . .

This will all show up when you trace the pattern . .

Why don't you use your hot-melt gun . . ? you haven't used
that thing since you bought it . . beats holding it there.

You can get a real good bond with a hot-melt gun on metal
if you heat the metal . . cold is just cold . .

I haven't mentioned treating the rust in your cancerous
hole  . . . do so . . .  :-)

Adhesive . . I like JBWeld but there are many . .
Use a decent lap and even bubble-gum would work . .

Body filler: I am using some &quot;Bondo&quot; brand fiberglass
body  filler right now but there are a half dozen
water-proof or all-metal etc. body fillers at your local
paint shop . . use them as your adhesive . .

For those few perverts who want the worst, you take a
piece of window screen and dab some bondo around the
edges, now you reach under the fender and slap it over the
hole . . now you start troweling on the bondo on the outside
till you got'er about the shape you want . .  :-)

Done neatly and with care and  such a patch will last you for
years . . and it will look &quot;almost&quot; perfect . . :-)

Yes I believe you'll do it right one of these days . . :-)
