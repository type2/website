problems starting....

If the bus was sitting all winter, the carb can get gunked up by the gas. If
you store your bus for extended periods you need to put some type of
stabilizer in the gas otherwise something happens to the gas..i think it is
bad for the carb. I think this could give you the symptoms you are talking
about. Sounds like you need to clean your carb thoroughly...

although could be fuel pump problem as well-i don't know anything about these
and am not sure what the symptoms of a bad one are...

good luck
