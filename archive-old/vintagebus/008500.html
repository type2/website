Subject: [VB] Got my bus home.


&gt;Hi all. I just came back from NE last night with my new bus in tow. I got
&gt;some pictures on my web-site already and will be getting more later.
&gt;Address is: http://www.inter-kiosk_dot_com/VW-Bus/     and go from there on. 
&gt;I'll have a ton of questions since this is only my second bus and I did
&gt;nothing with the first one. This one drives and it was only $1,000.00.
&gt;It's a bit weird though. I know now that it was a panel at one time
&gt;converted by some visionary pseudo mechanic to camper. Windows were cut
&gt;out using sawz-all I bet and in the back panel is cut-open to the engine
&gt;compartment. I mean really nasty job. Woodwork is not too nice as well.
&gt;I'll start with the questions next. Thanks all for all your feedback.
