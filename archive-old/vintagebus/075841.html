Subject: Where can I find a tranny?

Hello!

My bus (a '66) has not been running for almost 2 years.  We broke down in 
San Francisco (~1,000 miles from home) with (I think) a reduction box 
problem.  The big problem was that I didn't have a safe place to get her off 
her back wheels long enough to diagnose/repair whatever is wrong.  Week 
after next though, I'm bringing her back home on a U-haul trailer.

Can anyone recommend someone who does superb transmission/reduction box work 
(for a fair price) in Arizona/New Mexico/Southern California?

Does anyone have a 12 volt transmission w/reduction boxes (all the way out 
to the wheels) they'd like to sell?

ADVthanksANCE,
Michael
