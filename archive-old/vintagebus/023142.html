&gt;I bought a whole bunch of bulbs for the panel, as I have 6 dome lights
&gt;in it total.  All of the new 12v ones are longer than the originals,
&gt;and I think they're 12w.  They are *very* bright, and get *very* hot -
&gt;do I have the wrong bulbs?
&gt;
No, Thom...don't call *me* Clara.  ;)  Kidding, anyway, I put red bulbs in
my forward interior light and blues in my rear interior light.  They're
Kragen jobbies, so they're not the right size (unless you own a Bug)...I
had to fiddle with the connectors a little to get them to fit and stay in
place (as well as not break them).  They are bright and they do get warm,
but I try not to leave them on long enough to melt anything.  I've a $6
battery powered lantern from Wally-Mart to keep some decent light going.
