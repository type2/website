 were bitching about the price. $1500.00 for a solid Cali bus? So the
 interior is shot, big deal. That brings me to the point, we just simply
 don't appreciate something until we loose it.

Thats stoopid, some folks would rather pay $1100 for a rust bucket rather 
than kick down the extra $400 for a solid bus. unless you enjoy metal work 
and already have the bits it just doesnt make since.
