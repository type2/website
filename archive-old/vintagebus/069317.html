Subject: Re: [VB] Warning

I have been getting the run-around and BS excuses since Feb 8th. You know
how it goes: 
----------------------- Clip -----------------------
Contact the other buyers of his products.
I got scammed for $78.00 and found about 18 others that got scammed.
We teamed up with Visa/Master Card and his local Police with the
assistance of E bay and got him arrested.
If you can't get your money ......... get revenge.
I just satisfied a 90 day problem with a seller without help of E bay,
but they are willing to help you get results.
