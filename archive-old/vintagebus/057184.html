Subject: Re: [VB] should I feel bad or good

there is a great site that explains the common misconceptions about copyright.  it seems that in this new electronic world of ours, it is very easy to violate a copyright:

bus content:  wade sent me an email a while ago asking after the bed replacement saga i'd begun.  his email spurned me on to updating that particular page.  i didn't realize that he had a link to the page on his site.  knowing that i felt i had a &quot;responsibility&quot; to the community.

cheers,
