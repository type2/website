Why go through all of the trouble, just use a 12v to 6v voltage adapter and
the current wipers and motor. Headlights are one thing, you want them 12v if
you are going to drive at night, but if the wipers work and you don't
regularly drive through torrents of rain. why bother?

btw, in Oly, WA, rain is the norm, this long dry  sunny summer is an
aberration.   I've had to clean the dirt of my windows!!!!!!    Although it
doesn't usually pelt down, 6V wipers in a 12V bus with a voltage drop work
fine.
