&lt;&lt;    I have a 1960 bus and would like to put in a fuel guage, is this
 very hard to do? By the way I don't plan on hacking up the dash. I just
 want a guage to be on the safe side as I plan on some long trips.
 
                                               Thanks,

It does require installing a tank with a sending unit, which means removing 
the engine to remove the gas tank.  However, To me a working fuel guage is a 
reletively recent aquisition,   and was happily driving for years w/o such a 
luxury.  I do, however, tend to write down my fill ups with gas in my bus log 
book, and know my milage, so I dont run out.  This is particularly easy on 
road trips.   And since I got into the habit, for some wierd reason I still 
do it though my 65 has a functioning gas guage.  However, my 61 had a 
functioning reserve tap, and I would just pull the knob and know I had 40 
miles to get gas in.
