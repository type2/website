&gt;Is there any problems with the auto glass silicone causing rust?
&gt;In my 57, the old man siliconed all the windows shut.

&gt;I would be worried about this stuff they inject rusting out the channel under
&gt;the window frames.

Probably not as long as the auto-glass shops uses a HOT applicator. The 
stuff you can buy in the store is kept liquid in the tube with acidic acid 
(lemon juice) This being a hydrous hydrocarbon loaded cocktail that 
attracts corrosion. (it will even eat through most grades of stainless 
steel...course it has to be above 120 degrees F to do this)  All in all 
silicone sealants aren't that bad but also be sure to check out if the 
rubber in the window seals is compatible with silicone (not all are!)

I would have to agree with E&amp;B that tar is probably the way to go as the 
components of tar are almost identical to most common forms of rubber.
