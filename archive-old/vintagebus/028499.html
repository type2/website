Subject: re: cooling &amp; guages

Yesterday went over to Berg and picked up one of their dipstick gauges
since the 62 DC got hot coming back from the classic and I wanted to see
if it was just because the bonehead mechanic (that's me) had let the
front brakes drag or there was really something wrong with the motor.
I'd planned on putting on a VDO gauge, but in talking with the Berg
folks, they informed me that in all their testing the VDO units were
VERY inaccurate.  The fact that the warning light dipstick gauge was 1/3
the price also convinced me.

Anyone have any experience of this gauge vs. the VDOs I see on
everyone's busses.  I've hooked it up to a separate light instead of
T'ing into the oil light like they say to do.  I think that seeing a
range of temps would be helpful, but now I just needed a quick &quot;its too
hot indicator&quot;.  If the VDOs are reliable and accurate, I'll put those
in too.

Thanks.

Steve
