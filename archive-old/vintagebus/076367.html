Subject: Flipseat westies

I saw some pictures of a flip seat westy today, how were these done without
seriously reducing the strength of the bus - ie removing the bulkhead?

Did they just do it without thinking about it or is it safe to have a bus
without a bulkhead?

This particular one didn't have belly pans either.
