Subject: Dyno test complete/1800

   Tonight I finally got to dyno the 1800 type 1 engine. This is a 74 stroke
by 88 cut-ins, 7 to 1 compression, big valve duel port heads with duel
Kadrons. The dyno results are as follows

2500 rpm  51.5  hp  108.19 ft lbs torque
3000 rpm  60.6  hp  106.09 ft lbs torque
3500 rpm  71.7  hp  109.24 ft lbs torque
4000 rpm  79.2  hp  103.98 ft lbs torque
4500 rpm  83.7  hp    97.68 ft lbs torque
5000 rpm  85     hp   89.28  ft lbs torque

carb jetting   150 air  127.5 main  50 idle

    We found that the stock Kadron jetting is way to rich for the 1800 and
extremely rich for a 1600. Another problem is that we could of used a bigger
air correction, but decided to live with the 150. We also reset the
accelerator pump setting, The timing was set at 27 degrees total advance  at
first but advanced to 30 degrees, this added 3 hp.
   We tested the engine with a Thunderbird header with a junk EMPI (China)
tuck-a-way) muffler. Geoff Hart who did the dyno work (you have seen his
test in Hot VW's) said that if I used a better header (S-S) with a better
muffler (dyno max) we would gain approx 10 hp more and the equivalent in
torque.
   I designed this engine for a good torque band in the rpm range that most
of us drive our buses at. I have the same engine in my 1960 DD panel and
found it has a lot more pulling power then the 1776 that was in it
previously. 

  In the near future I am going to pull the 1800 out of my bus (14,000 plus
miles) and put it on the dyno (when we have more time) and do some more
exhaust test and carb changes to see what it produces, even after the miles.

  I learned a lot from Geoff about the importance of proper jetting and saw
HP differences in just what a little jet change can do. I have all the data
on each change and will post it to www.volksrescue_dot_com when I finally get
the site up and running
