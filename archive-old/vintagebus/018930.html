Subject: (sorry but) New Microbus MPEG if you want it
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

I have 2 MPEG videos of the New Microbus, from the
press release from the Detroit auto show.

One is the bus spinning on a turntable, the other is a
lifestyle/different angles of the bus in and out
video, about 4 minutes long.

The long one is 34 megabytes. The short one is 12
megabytes.

If you have an email account that can handle this
size, and an MPEG viewer, and you're interested,
P-mail me and I'll email one or both of these to you.

You just have to promise to NOT post comments on the
list (LOL)
