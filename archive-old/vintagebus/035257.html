starter dying?    I bought a rebuild starter from Schucks (also checkers/
Kragen) cheap wth forever warranty and few years ago for my 65 westy.    The
starter I got with the bus worked fine for a while, then would sometimes
click and take a few tries till it started.

replaced it, and it was fine till this past November.  SO I took it back for
the warranty and installed another.   (I tested it w/ a battery charger  with
the starter bolted to a piece of a tranny to check the old one was dead and
also the new one worked before installing.

then a month or so ago it started click click, but not starting.  Okay after
a few tries it'd start.     yes battery etc was fine.      then was worse.
Well, with a bad starter and a leaky motor with slipping clutch I stopped
driving it and went for the safari corner window bus.

The other day I took the motor out of the 65

checked the starter with the battery charger-  nope, dead.   Found the
receipt , went to Shmucks, got a replacement,    replaced the starter bushing
just for the Halibut, and installed the rebuildt starter that I hope will
last longer this time.  Better put that recepit back in the drawer in the
camper.

yesterday I took the motor out of the 61 and put it in the 65.   The
preheat/air cleaner set up is different, and had to hook up wires for the
generator (65 had had a nalternator).

CARB

So since the motor had run funky at start up I took the carb off to inspect
it.  Previously it had run smooth all the time, but at some point develope
this wierd thang.

took the top off the carb and noticed the little brass fuel U squirter thing
was gone.  Musta falledn into the manifold.  eek.  Found one- it was
cloogged.  found another, it too clogged.  third one was good.   figured the
rest worked why mess with it, washed up the carb so it is cleaner, and put
that back together.  Started the bus up and it ran smooth.  :)

the plan is to do a bit of work to the 61 so it's off the road for a bit.
