Subject: Pickup Tilts - Webbing Straps

Wade &amp; List:

I've owned 2 original Single Cab tilts, one came from South America, the other the States.  Both had webbing straps that were for all practical purposes the same *natural* color as the canvas itself.  Granted they were darker due to wear and handling, but they weren't a dark green or brown.  I have a ton of natural color webbing strap if anyone needs any.  Tom??  It's readliy avaliable, so unless the notion is that a darker color is correct, why not use the same color?

On another note, it is my understanding that the tips of the webbing straps were dipped in shelac to keep the ends from fraying.  Maybe this had something to do with the appearance that the straps were a darker color.  You might want to do this to yours Tom, not so much to keep it close to og, but to keep them from fraying.

Tom, out of curiosity, what are you using for backing on the loops and around the window, a tannish or greenish vinyl?  Also, what are you using for the hooks on the straps to keep the sides up?  I personally used a correct gauge wire and bent my own.  I made up a small jig that I bent them around when I was making tilts.

Robert
