&gt; short of nuclear assault, what methods do you folks recommend for

Get a medium or coarse cup-shaped wire brush, chuck it into a hand
drill motor, and have at it!  It'll eat through the bondo at a good
clip, but won't hurt the metal beneath it.  Wear breathing protection
and clean up the bondo dust afterward, as who knows what nasty
substances are in earlier formulations of bondo!
