Subject: Re: Crank end play 


I think I need the crankshaft oil seal changing as 
there's a bit of a persistent drip at idle. However, I 
know this can be a symptom of much worse in terms of 
crank bearings.....what kind of play should I have on 
the crank? I can shift it about 2mm at the moment.

Chris,

2mm is a little too much but I've seen worse run for a long time.  
When you change the flywheel seal check for play in main bearing.  
There are several ways to do this: one is to slide the crank back and 
forth while looking for movement in the bearing, if there is obvious 
play between the bearing and the engine case it't time for a rebuild 
and align-bore otherwise you'll spin the bearing a destroy your case.  
The other method of checking bearing play is to use a large pair of 
needle nose plyers, or something similiar, and delicately grab the 
outside edge of the bearing to see if moves in the case.  Once again, 
if it moves, rebuild the engine.

Good luck,

Jeff
