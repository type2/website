True, indeed, the bill was vetoed by the Guv on 29Sep2000.  The veto
message stated:

&quot;This bill would authorize the extension of the Year of Manufacture
license plate program to vehicles 1973 or older, conflicts with the
intent of laws that require license plate reflectorization.  License
plate reflectorization enhances public safety and assists police
officers and citizens in identifying vehicles that are involved in
unlawful activities.

The purpose of the vehicle license plate is for identification and
registration purposes only.  The issuance of vehicle license plates
is not to enhance the beauty or value of a vehicle.&quot;

What an old poop!

&gt; I find that there was a bill (AB2058) which would have opened
&gt; up the ability to register a car prior to '74 with YOM plates, which
&gt; seemed to have been vetoed by the governor.  Is this true?
