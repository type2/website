&gt; If it's an internal regulator, you should end up with a fat red wire
&gt; from the D+ or B+ terminal on the alternator to the battery positive
&gt; terminal, either at the battery, or at the starter where the battery
&gt; cable bolts on.  The thin blue wire (for the generator light in the
&gt; speedometer) should go to the 61 terminal.

 Just as another data point, on the AL82N/X internally regulated
alternators I've seen, the spade terminal for the idiot light (blue
wire) was marked as D+, and the B+ terminal (fat red wire to
battery/starter) was a threaded stud.  61 is the DIN designation for
charge indicator on alternators, so I don't know why it's marked as
D+.

The internally regulated alts need the idiot light to initially build
the magnetic field in the rotor windings.  It will eventually
self-excite but not at idle rpms.

I think AL82X designates a rebuilt unit (eXchange) and AL82N is New.
