&gt;Sorry to bring up a sore subject again so soon. Reading the GGC newsletter 
&gt;it also says that they &quot;would hold to the 25 years or older vintage 
&gt;definition and see if it makes a difference&quot;. The newsletter also states &quot; 
&gt;basically the classes for next year's show will be 1967 and earlier and 
&gt;1968-1976&quot;. These years include the lagwagons and even some rabbits. These 
&gt;rules sound fair (remember it is billed as a vintage meet) and will help to 
&gt;keep another early car in and a NB out. I promise to keep my '63 DC in the 
&gt;parking lot if it makes room for even 1 more nice BD,split,oval,heb or 
&gt;even(gulp) baywindow.

Mario's got a good point, but I have a further explanation on the classes
informally from a fellow club member up here.  She writes:

&gt;I honestly don't think you'll have too many headaches, IF the people at the 
&gt;gate do their jobs.  With the new rules we've put in place, ANY CAR coming 
&gt;through the gate is in the show, so the parkers will only have to point that 
&gt;car to its class.  They park WITH their class.  Now, if you get a bunch of 
&gt;guys in a bus come in and want to park with their friends in a BUG, that 
&gt;won't be possible and the best thing will be to just TELL them that right
off 
&gt;the bat.  Park with their class or they leave.

And the end of that statement is basically geared toward folks who come in
as a group or a club or whatever and all want to just park together and
party.  I think it's more or less the approach they're taking to clear out
the general parking crowd.

Now, I'm sure all this does is invite more criticism from the general
populous, but ya know...there's no guarantee any of these ideas are gonna
work for the club.  Realise this is gonna be an experimental year for
them...all the club meetings this year have had some argument over how to
run the show in 2001, so all I can recommend is be patient, have faith in
the club, and come up and enjoy the event whatever you drive. :)
