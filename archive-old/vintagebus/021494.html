Hi Mark&amp;Tracey,
If you can get a sales receipt.  Then make an appointment with the nearest 
Washington State Patrol office and have the bus towed there to have it 
inspected.  Strange rule they have is that the auto being inspected must have 
an engine in it.  Just an engine case with number on it will do.  
  If that does not work then get a temporary three year title for it.  If the 
owner shows up then they can claim it.  So you must keep photographic and 
receipts of parts and work done to it so you can be reinbursed for your 
repairs if the owner shows up.  Which is highly unlikely!    Eric&amp;Barb
