MESSAGE MONITORED BY THE VW CONTENT POLICE ;-0

 The pictures of VW BUSSES (up to 1979) site is up and running. I'm not
totally done but decided that there's enough material to start. The direct
link is http://www.frontpageaccess_dot_com/raderik/vw_bus_gallery.htm and will
be posting a link to the site from another URL.

 It is pretty generic at this time but will be working on &quot;beautifying&quot; it
some and making it a little more comfortable to surf maybe by using frames.

Again, thanks to all of you that allowed the copying or sent pictures. Send
your opinion directly to me. I don't believe that bandwidth should be wasted
with this matter. I would appreciate your cooperation. Thanks!
