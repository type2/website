The events put on by these guys are some of the cheesiest I've ever seen.
Gives all the strippers something to do on a satruday afternoon, I guess.
Also really big with the pierced tongue/nipple/??? tatooed &amp; gansta crowds.


Kinda sucks the bumped the VW show to saturday, so the honda girls can
play on sunday.  Now *there's* the gansta crowd.

They were also hassling a guy I know 'cause he was selling his own T
shirts in the swap area.  The didn't like the competetion with the
cal-look event t-shirts.  Also seen lots of grumbling between vendors
and show workers over various issues, like waiting too long to let the 
vendors in to set up,etc.

I'm prolly gonna sit this one out.
