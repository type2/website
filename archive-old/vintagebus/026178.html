There are numerous &quot;Rattle Can Paint Jobs&quot; driving around the State of
AridZona.--Krylon seems to be the paint of choice--Rubbing out to a nice
finish does Not take that long! These are all daily driver buses that
are used and enjoyed by their owners. Up in Prescott a wavy sided bus
was put straight by using plaster as body filler;
then a sealer was applied. Have no idea how it held up in the rain--but
it is being driven that way for over a year now.. The Street Rod club
that i belong to has several high dollar machines that are painted
&quot;Rattle Can&quot; primer in various colors including flames.At many of the
big VW shows we now have a New Beetle class--Is it time for a &quot;Rattle
Can Paint Job&quot; class?  In fact the Arizona Bus Club has already awarded
a trophy for Best Rattle Can Paint job!!   You are only limited, by your
amount of imagination.-------  uj
