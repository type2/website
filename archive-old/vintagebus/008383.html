Subject: Re: [VB] What year is this tent really for?

On the subject of tents... I have a similar Westfalai tent with heavy vinyl
grey floor, blue roof, red/white stripe front door cover over screen,
external frame, and complete with original Westfalia bags for poles and
tent.

I use it on my '67 Westfalia and it works perfectly with the side doors open
inside the tent and the whole thing attached to the bus. If this is a
&quot;68-72&quot; model there is no pocket that a sliding door would fit into. Tryed
it with a '73 Westfalia and had to leave the backside of the tent open for
the sliding door to function. There supposedly is a date stamp somewhere on
the floor along the seams???... never found it.  Anyway, from this
description.... what is the guess of the year of manufacture of this tent
model.

Also found the same tent in a 1966 Westfalia Dormobile I used to own.....

&gt; That is a 68 to 72? Westfalia tent.  It will work on basically any year
&gt; bus.  Yup....any bus with a rain gutter will work.  That's because it
&gt; attaches with a rubber lip that grips to the rain gutter of the bus.  It
&gt; really is designed for sliding door bay busses though.  There is a pocket
&gt; that the door slides into I think.  No big deal though as many people use
&gt; these with the split busses.  A correct tent for your 66 (if it  is a
Westy
&gt; ) would have a internal frame and be a bit different.  Talk to Jim about
the
&gt; differences.  He has the correct one.
