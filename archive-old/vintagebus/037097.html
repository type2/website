Hi Andrew,
With dual circuit MC brakes you have to hand adjust all the brake shoe 
adjusting stars to a very tight fit.  Then bleed the brakes starting with the 
front pair of wheels and then the rears.  Omce these two thngs are done you 
back off the brake shoe adjusting star till they just rub on the drum and 
have fun!   Eric&amp;Barb
