Hi Jason,
Well we got our's for $250.00 from a good friend who is not really into the 
VWs, just automotive literature.  The OG ones are hard to find, but there are 
repros out there that are hard to tell the differance (The OG ones have a 
manufacture stamping/mark in the hinge area.) since most of the parts are just boat 
ladder parts!  As for $450.00 price that does seem way too high to us.
