Once upon a time when most vehicles came with a removable hand
crank/starting handle it was common to have a short extension beyond the
&quot;ears&quot;.  The extension fitted into a recess/drilling in the crankshaft nut
or the
crankshaft itself.  This arrangement centered and stabilized the end of the
starting handle while you hand cranked the engine.

Some designs also incorporated a coil spring around the short extension.  To
hand crank the engine you had to push in on the handle while cranking in
order to keep the &quot;ears&quot; engaged in the lugs on the crankshaft nut.

The idea was that when the engine fired the spring would help free the
starting handle from the crankshaft nut.  This would reduce the possibility
of the starting handle kicking back or flailing around and injuring the
person wielding it.

Years ago it was common for junkyards to have a huge pile of anonymous
starting handles/hand cranks.  If you needed one you just poked around the
pile until you found one that worked on your engine/vehicle.  Hand over a
buck [or less] and it was yours.

It was also common for folks to buy the biggest, meanest looking hand crank
they could find and carry it beside or under the driver's seat for &quot;personal
protection&quot;.  Never any hassle from the gendarmes because it was &quot;just&quot; a
starting handle and they were ubiquitous :-)

OBC:  I think it was a sad day when VW discontinued this tool.  Even with a
totally dead battery, as long as a generator-equipped VW engine was in a
reasonable state of tune it could always be started on the hand crank.  Even
VW buses that had the battery stolen while parked for extended periods were
never stranded, cuz they could be fired up with a couple of swings of the
starting handle.

FWIW.....

&gt;&gt;  ...I'm thinking the extra post sticking out would provide more stability
for cranking an industrial engine?  &lt;&lt;
