&gt; Not only that, but are the beetles, buses, things,

&gt; house and 7 VW's and the 
&gt; city came to us pulling this BS I was pissed, and I
&gt; went to court(to no 
&gt; avail). It's ridiculous in this land of the free
&gt; that we can't have as many 
&gt; cars as we want. Don't the lawmakers of this land
&gt; need to get busy cracking 
&gt; down on real crime?

 Where do you think you are! I live in a country where
folks can kill &amp; getaway with it... steal a car &amp; be
outa jail the next day... or if you do get the death
sentence, ya get to live in luxury for the next 20
years before they give a stay of execution for the
next 20...  Or if your innocent you could still do 2
or 3 years, then the MAN says, &quot;Oh, you didnt have
anything to do with this, your free to go.&quot; after
everything youve worked for is gone.
 Its like those ole boys that drug that man to
death...
they admented to it... need to take em out... tie em
up behind a bus (bus content) &amp; do the same... Next
person who thought about doing sumthin stupid like
that might stop &amp; think..... The law books in Texas
still state that a man can be hung for horse
rustling... Aint been much of that goin on.... 
As Hank JR put it.. An Eye for an Eye &amp; a Tooth for a
Tooth....
 Wait a minute.... we were talkin about cars in the yard...right?
