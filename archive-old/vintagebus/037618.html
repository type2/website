&lt;&lt; Is anyone familiar with this item, particularly with it's functional
 effectiveness?  If it is an effective heater it would be placed into service
 this winter. &gt;&gt;
Hi Fred,
We have picked up several of these over the years for $10.00-20.00.  Saw one 
sell at Puyallup Oktobugfest for $15.00 used.  Mostly needed if you park over 
2 or 3 hours in areas where temps stay below 15F, and cause way to thick of 
oil at start up.  Like Alaska where there are 110AC plug in outlets on main 
streets of towns to keep your engine warm!   Eric&amp;Barb
