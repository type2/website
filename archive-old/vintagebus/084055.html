Subject: Re: Carb wierdness

Hey all,

I started this discussion with Joe off list, but thought I'd post the  
comments here to see what kind of feedback I get. ;-)

I had bought one of those &quot;rebuilt german solex carbs&quot; off The Samba  
and an SVDA from aircooled_dot_com. Got it back from mechanic #1 who put  
them in and the engine would bog down and almost die if I gave it  
moderate gas. I could nurse it off the line and eventually get up to  
speed. I went to mechanic #2

Here's what mechanic #2 said

1) Timing was set to 5-6 BTDC. He said the timing marks on the SVDA  
are different and you have to know that to get it right. Obviously  
mechanic #1 didn't - but you have to start out with good timing  
first. (I'll ask him what he dialed it in at when he was done - but  
he said he would document the timing mark and setting for me.)
2) The main jet on the carb was restricted. He says that it is common  
for the main jets on the old carbs to get gummed up over time. The  
main jets have to be &quot;opened up&quot; for the engine to run correctly.  
This will result in slightly worse gas mileage, but the engine will  
run better. (I've seen some other discussion here about re-jetting,  
but I have to admit that I have no idea what I'm talking about here.)  
He said that modern gas isn't easy on old carbs, and that carbs don't  
outlast the vehicles anymore anyways. Spend the extra $ and just buy  
a brazilian. He says he has seen the Brosol carbs work out of the box  
with almost no adjustment needed.

I won't comment about how much I have spent for mechanics #1 and #2  
to resolve this issue that really is quite a simple one. Learnin'  
ain't cheap.

Conrad
