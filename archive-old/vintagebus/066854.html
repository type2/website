&gt; I'm in need of an in-line electric fuel cut-off valve.
&gt; I've cobbled together my BN4 heater with an aftermarket electric fuel
&gt; pump and adjusted flow with a brass needle valve but I'm nervous about
&gt; installing it without a positive cut-off in there.

IF I am not mistaken the BN4 uses a similar fuel pump to the BA4 that I
have....these fuel pumps are metered injection pumps, NOT continous flow
and a regular carb fuel pump is likely to pump far too much fuel possibly
causing a fire.

please check before firing that thing up, don't heat your bus or yourself
into cinders
