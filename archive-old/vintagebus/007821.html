&gt; Thanks for the kind words.
&gt;
&gt; Politically, Southern Africa is fairly stable. The rally was
originally
&gt; planned to go through Zimbabwe, but with the tense situation there
with
&gt; gangs of thugs grabbing white-owned farms, the route was changed to
go via
&gt; Botswana and Namibia instead. Next year the entire rally will take
place
&gt; within South Africa's borders.
&gt;
&gt; SA is very stable politically, although violent crime is a serious
concern.
&gt; I have travelled literally hundreds of thoudands of kilometres
around SA
&gt; over the past 10 years and I feel safer from criminal thugs while
travelling
&gt; than when at home, however, wehther I'm safe from other drivers is
another
&gt; issue ...
&gt;
&gt; come drive with us
&gt;
&gt; fig
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Thanks for the wonderful writing. Quite an adventure you took.
Since I
&gt; &gt;live in California, I don't have a clear view of the political
climate
&gt; &gt;in S. A. Things must be quite stable for a group to take such a
long
&gt; &gt;trip on the open road. Can you enlighten us as to the political
&gt; &gt;situations down there?
&gt; &gt;
