Subject: shows in maine and new hampshire?

I just recently spent half a day driving up to new hampshire looking for
this great parts car for a squareback i got a few months ago. unfortunately
it was compacted about three weeks ago. definitely not what i was planning
on hearing-i already had all the parts swapped(in my head).

anyway while there this nice guy I met mentioned a show in maine and new
hampshire coming up soon-but he didnt know the particulars...anyone out
there know?

thanks
