Subject: Case Bore Size?



Come on guys!!  Anyone out there have a copy of WOG for a 1500 type 2, 
assuming there was one, that will answer my bearing question?  The WOG for a 
1969 1600 shows we are over tolerance at a wear limit of 2.5601&quot; but is the 
1500 the same as the 1600?  And if you do have a WOG for the earlier years 
perhaps you could loan it to me for scanning and inclusion on the 
documentation project with the others?  I think some out there will vouch 
for me if you are worried about getting it back.

&gt;
&gt;
&gt;A couple of questions:
&gt;
&gt;1.) On a pre-1965 engine case with a &quot;B&quot; coded engine that was originally a
&gt;1500cc, what was the original case bore size on the number 1 bearing?  Our
&gt;case is measuring 2.5745&quot;.... comments?
&gt;
&gt;2.) Can you use the 1600cc cylinder bores in a 1500 case without machining?
&gt;
