Subject: BBB TO COLORADO???????
To: wades_wagens_at_uswest_dot_net, vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

Im trying ot find someone coming from Colorado to BBB who could possibly 
transport a seat from the show back to the Denver area.
I can pay up to 100$ for delivery to the house 80 miles north of Denver.
Or possibly negotiate picking up somewhere in the area.
I need a response ASAP.
Call me at 1-800-201-4201 if you think we can work something out.
THANKS!
Greg
