Well, it looks like my source for a passenger-side lightbucket is flaking (
I am assuming thru too many daily personal and professional demands, and
not a habitual quality of being a flake :)   )  so I am once again beating
the bushes...
The 65 s/c needs the right lightbucket bad, as it is the last piece of my
nose rebuilding puzzle; Poppa Ken sent me a NICE middle nose sheet some
time back, I've got new behind-the-bumper bits from Ronnie... and the
borrowed mig unit for only two more weeks!
While we're on the subject, some floor pans would be nice, too - don't need
the complete things, just the extreme front corners of both sides.   I
don't have the budget to buy these pieces new, and this is a repair and not
a resto, so *slightly* grungy pieces are more than acceptable.
