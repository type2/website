Subject: Tuesday Questions

Been driving the truck a bunch since all my &quot;new&quot; cars have decided to
let me down all at once and the only thing that's reliable is the 40+
year old double cab.  Last night I finally got around to adjusting the
brakes and replacing the right side axle boot on the 62 (with 67?
tranny), and I had a few questions.

Does one boot usually go bad before the other?  One was cracking and
leaking and the other looks almost new.  I replaced them both two years
ago when putting this bus back in service.


The PO told me that a '67 tranny had been swapped in for the original
box right before I bought it.  When changing the right side boot I
noticed the part number was a 113 number.  Do bus tranny center sections
have a bug part number or is this a bug tranny center section???

Thanks.

Steve
