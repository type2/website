Subject: Speedo cable and cold weather

  The last few days it has been in the 40's in the mornings here in Havasu,
well on my way to work each morning my speedo cable has been whining and my
needle bouncing around, sounds like all hell breaking loose, then it
happened. It was like Randy Johnson winding up for a fast ball pitch. I
heard a terrible screech, the needle whipped around, hit the pin and snapped
the clear needle right in half !. Moral of the story: If you hear your cable
whining, disconnect the cable before you destroy your speedo. Now I have to
dig through my stash and find another speedo to install, along with a new
cable, bummer.

Ronnie
