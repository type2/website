Ok,

I have a decent Crew to pass along that I got some great info on... and I
want to provide everyone with my impression of the Crew Cab market:

  1) A lot of great people on this list who are willing to help and refuse
any compensation.  If anyone who has helped wants a favor, PLEASE ask.  I
think $20 is more than fair for a complete body check out.  I owe about 4
good visits!  Thanks to all in Sacramento, San Jose, and Phoenix area!
  2) Crew Cabs are up there with 23 Windows... they aren't cheap.  A lot of
feedback that the San Jose one at http://www.i405_dot_com/vw/crew2/ was too
expensive at $4200 without engine, $5500 with engine.  I won't go into
details, but the engine is worth $1300 (especially if you want to drive it
home).  Most people told me that this seemed about $1000 high.  I'll agree
that it is a LITTLE high, but there are a lot of REALLY HIGH prices out
there.  Frankly, this one is a solid deal at $5500 and sets the benchmark
for &quot;fair price&quot;.  Yes, these pups are expensive and are going up...

Here is the '62 Crew info.  He is starting at $6000 but seems willing to
deal.  Real great to deal with over Internet (has great photos and answers
e-mail with lots of detail).

Still a remote contender for me, but a little more project than I want, and
a little too far away.

Original for-sale:
http://www.type2_dot_com/cgi-local/buysell.cgi?MODE=3&amp;RECORD=902814547

Just to let you know...La Jolla is in SOUTHERN Southern California 
(approx. 450 miles south of San Jose).

I put more pictures on the ftp site, check it out.  If it's definitely 
the best body that you're after, you may want to take a good look at 
the pictures.

I had planned on completely restoring the crew cab.  I began with and 
completed the mechanical restoration.  The body, paint, and interior 
are all that is left to do, but ALL of the original body parts are 
present and in good condition.  The mechanical restoration is the more 
expensive restoration, so I wanted to get it done before I dove into 
the body, paint, and interior.

The crew cab will definitely make the drive back home for you and all 
of the &quot;safety&quot; devices that you mentioned are working.

As for the price, please note that I am serious when I say &quot;or best 
offer&quot;.  I am much more concerned about the truck going to someone who 
is going to complete the restoration and appreciate the pickup for what 
it is.  The $6000 is a figure based on all of the mechanical work that 
has been done to the crew cab--all work done by Top Line Racing in 
Anaheim, CA.

Yes, the crew cab is still for sale.  However, I just moved to La
Jolla, near San Diego (about an hour and a half car drive south of
Aliso Viejo).  You can check out some pictures at
ftp://optic.ucsd_dot_edu/crewcab/ (Note: ftp, NOT http).  Let me know if
you'd like to see any other pictures and I'll put them on my site right 
away.
