Subject: Holy dirt batbus

&lt;&lt;I will never ,ever, ever sand blast the floors of a bus again.&gt;&gt;

Well, I havent been sandblasting mine. Instead, I have been using a hand
grinder to remover the scale and then brush painting with a white primer
with a high zinc content. Don't know if this is the best way to go about
it, but so far I am content to do it though it is a formidable task. And
to top it off, I may paint or undercoat on top of the primer! But I may
delay that part until later and may spray that final coat. I know it may
not be as smooth as if I sprayed everything, but it is underneath the
bus and my intent is simply to stop or at least slow down the rust
developement. It is starting to look real sweet. I pulled the belly pan
and got that really really clean before giving tow coats of zinc primer
on both sides followed by two coats of red on both sides. I think it
will give me a real grin when I find it necessary to crawl under it. One
thing is for certain. . . I won'rt have rust scale dropping into my
face.
