hello

i am for sure that it is a coil and it looks like the old one that come with 
my bus. My bus is now 12 volt with blue coil.  it is connected into the 
wiring by the spade terminals on either side of the dizzy plug wire goes.
it is not stereo capacitors because i already have one of those.

there are not any anonymus switchs that do not work  my bus is fairly 
original according to ronnie anyway.

thanks again

&gt; &gt;I also have what looks like an old bosch 6 volt
&gt; &gt;coil wired into my wiring.   What is it there
&gt; &gt;for (is it a booster for the old wiring?)
&gt;
&gt;Is your bus 12 volt now?  It probably would have
&gt;been 6 volt originally.  If so, someone may have
&gt;wired that coil in series with the &quot;real&quot; 6v coil
&gt;(on the fan shroud) so they could keep running a
&gt;6v coil.  In other words, they ran two 6v coils in
&gt;series on 12v.  The only problem is that the added
&gt;one would tend to spark a little too when the main
&gt;one fires.
&gt;
&gt;Here's another idea.  Do you have any anonymous
&gt;toggle or push-button switches in the cab?  An old
&gt;hot-rod trick was to wire a switch on the dash to
&gt;a second coil.  This coil fed one spark plug that
&gt;was installed near the tip of the exhaust pipe.
&gt;&gt;If you're sure it's a coil (a cylinder about 2.5&quot;
&gt;(6.5cm) by 6&quot; (15cm) with two small connections and
&gt;one big insulated &quot;tower&quot; in the center) then those
&gt;are the only two things I can think of.  If it looks
&gt;about like that but doesn't have the center big
&gt;connection, it might be a big capacitor (condenser),
&gt;perhaps added to support a stereo (only likely if
&gt;your bus is 12v) &gt;
