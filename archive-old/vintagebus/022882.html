Yeah, this Kelley Park has to have been the biggest and one of the best
yet.  I know, the gates got closed early and it was said that 200 cars were
still in line outside.  I'm a member of the Golden Gate Chapter (amongst
many other clubs) and really we are often at the city's mercy when it comes
to doing things lately.  I think there's now a greater lean toward making
it a truly *vintage* show.  The GGC could benefit from taking some lessons
from (so I've heard) the Bob Baker show down in Carlsbad where it's just
vintage and just swappers.  That could go a long way next year to fitting
more people in.

That annoying politics crap aside, I had a blast!  Roger, Susan, and I
staffed the Silicon Valley Chapter of SV2s booth along with new member,
Mario, and had some great traffic along the swap row!  I put so many faces
to so many email addresses.  Thom, Everett (and brother Dave), Ronnie, John
Howard, Steve Migetto (sp?), and I'm sure any number of other members I saw
in passing.  Met a lot of Split Bus Club members I've only heard of by name
and a lot of SV2s members I've heard of by name.

I took delivery of my Hot Dog Fred roof rack and ladder.  It's just awesome
and looks great on the 63 Camper!!  I know he could have sold it to people
five times over...the rack has already traveled further than I have in the
camper (OC to Tucson to OC to Kelley Park!), but that'll change before
long.  :)

Big big thanks to Rick Spohn and the folks of the GGC for going thru the
stress of putting on this show, all members of vintagebus, SBC, SV2s, etc
for stopping by and showing their support of the new chapter, and Dave
Cormack for coming over and chatting in between taking pics of the show!

Next year: well, we're thinking of a Bus-only event on the Saturday before
Kelley Park.  Don't pencil it in just yet, but we're looking into it!
