&gt; As I understand it, you can run propane and gasoline
&gt; on the same engine - basically you have the propane
&gt; carb and the gas carb and can use either.  Using
&gt; two different liquid fuels, like gasoline and alcohol,
&gt; is more interesting but still doable.  I would guess
&gt; that because of the different energy contents of
&gt; different liquid fuels, you would need different
&gt; jet sizes and settings in a regular carb to run 
&gt; multiple fuels. 

this is the beauty of the fish it doesn't need to be re jetted 
just adjusted on the shaft for a richer/leaner mixture.

did you study the info in my links?

boy this is one long Friday....
