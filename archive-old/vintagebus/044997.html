MAny years ago Clara &amp; I put an engine from a crashed 77 bus into gher 73 camper. I still have the sliding door sitting in my garage and need the room.
I llive in Cupertino in the san Francisco bay area, and could be persuaded to take it to bugorama in sacramento.
If I hear nothing in the next few weeks it goes out with the garbage, window lok trim &amp; all!
