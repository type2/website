Subject: Re: [VB] Torque hub king nut to 650 ft-lbs+++ ??

There ain't but a real short list of things that can let the piston fall
out. The brakes weren't adjusted properly. That's the list. The problem
ain't hiding in a brake line or master cylinder. Your drums could be cut
oversize which would make the diameter too big, but if properly adjusted
they still can't fall out. If you can't get them properly adjusted you throw
the drums away. If the piston can come out of the cylinder it has too much
room to move, plain and simple. When adjusted properly those pistons
shouldn't move much more than about an eighth to a quarter of an inch each
to seat the shoes on the drum. To fall out they need to move more than the
length of the piston, over a half. This isn't rocket science.

And there is absolutely no need to torque them above 650 ft. lbs. unless you
like destroying parts. 250 ft. lbs. is plenty adequate. It's not like they
can back out while locked with a cotter key. The drum needs to be torqued
all the way to 250 on your bus or the axle seals may leak, but the use of a
big-assed impact on the axle nuts is just abuse.

&gt; I went to the local VW guru. Had brakes redone. Back brake piston came out
&gt; of wheel cylinder 3 days later when wife romped on brakes.

&gt; What do you think of the Torqing? Why is it needed?
