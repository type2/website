&lt;&lt; Well, thanks to Clara and Eric and Barb for recommending i change my
 transmission oil.  Wow, was that stuff cruddy.  &gt;&gt;
Hi Jdd,
You did change the oil in the reduction boxes at the same time right?  Did
you get any noticable steel chunks out of them?  Mark down that you should
change the tranny/reduction oil at least once somewhere about 1,000 miles or
if you really like your bus change it twice one at 500 miles and again at
1,000 miles.  This will help get almost all of the crud out.  Then replace
the oil at least every 30,000 miles or if you want to baby it every 20,000
miles.  If you have a tranny rebuilder in your area or a wrecking yard that
you are on good terms with you should to get more magnetic plugs to replace
all of the non-magnetic plugs in your tranny and reduction boxes.  This way
you will have as much steel dust/shavings removed as possible as you drive
along your way.
&lt;&lt; I
spoke to a guy today and he told me that the clutch cable housing can
deteriorate inside and that you can be left with the cable riding on the bare
steel of the cable housing and that this can lead to clutch cable breakage. &gt;&gt;
That makes no sense to us.  The clutch cable runs through a steel tube welded
to the bus body with no housing of the cable's own.  Suggest applying oil to
the clutch and brake pedals piviot area and see if that helps.  You are
welcome,  Eric&amp;Barb
