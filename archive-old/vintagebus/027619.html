You'll have to take the boxes apart to put them on your tranny so you
might as well rebuild them. The quality of bearings is just as good now
as it has ever been, if not better. Just be sure to buy bearings that
were made in a country with a nice long industrial history. China is
still learning about this stuff.

&gt; Normally I would rebuild first but I am a little concerned about the quality
&gt; of the bearings available.  Seems like all bearings are made in China now.
&gt; If the originals are good I would rather just leave them.  Any way to tell
&gt; without taking the boxes apart?
