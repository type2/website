Subject: ARC vs. MIG - torsion bars

------=_NextPart_84815C5ABAF209EF376268C8
Content-type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII


hi all. i am rebuilding the front end in my 56 bus. i have 
disassembled it to the point where i have removed the 2 sets of torsion bars. 
one set, i believe the uppers, are cracked at the welds on both ends, so that 
the leafs can be separated into 3 smaler groups. the lower set is cracked only 
at one end, and only for 2 of the leafs. 

my question is: should i be concerned? i feel like the 
welds are there strictly to hold the leafs from &quot;slipping&quot; outwards, and they 
have no bearing on flexibility or overall strength since they are contained in 
the trailing arm. i have in the past installed the leaf spring clusters with a 
broken weld at one end with no problems, but the set with both 
ends broken is a little alarming to me. i was considering taking a grinder 
wheel to the old weld down the center and making a groove in the weld and just 
MIG welding it to keep them together. any and all VW service manuals i have read 
say to ARC weld. will MIG be too hot or is there something special about that 
fancy looking, nicely laid puddle that the factory did?

i don't think bug torsion bars are welded and i can't 
recall them &quot;slipping&quot; outwards, so again, should i be concerned? i guess i 
could always have them welded when they were installed.

any suggestions?

jon
