Just recieved about 32 barndoor style shift couplers, these are the
lamenated style coupler, and they come with new screws (these are made in
Mexico, if the packageing serves me right). Also I just recieved some more
of the regular shift couplers (sold out at KP) these are excellent quality
OEM for VW, the best Ive seen in ages, Ive recieved 15 more of these, and
when there gone I don't know when I'll find this quality again.
