&gt; On a slightly unrelated note to Greg's email, I have to rave about this book someone on 
&gt; another list suggested.  It's called _Blue Highways_, was written around 1982, and is 
&gt; this great travel journal of a guy who just takes off one day in his F*rd van and drives all 
&gt; over the little tiny two-lane highways of America.  Very cool!  


was my first 'reading' of books on tape i took on my cross country trip last summer.  nothing like
driving the blue highways while listening to someone elses experience doing the same thing.

i'll second the recomendation.
