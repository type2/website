Hi Richard, just keep the replacement wires as big as the old ones or bigger 
and you will have no problems as long as you solder, heatshrink all places 
you are connecting wires together or when putting on an electrical clips on 
ends of these wires.  The factory crimped on connectors are the only ones 
that work well without solder.  Last we heard the special tool to crimp these 
connectors on was about $150.00.  Do yourself and the next owner of this VW a 
big favor and only use wires of the same color and stripe as the ones being 
replaced to to keep future electrical jobs from creating madness!  Best place 
to get these type of wires and proper size is out of other wiring harnesses 
out of wrecked VWs. Eric&amp;Barb
