It all depends upon where you are.  Since you bought it from a tow
service, they must have had something like a &quot;mechanics' lien&quot; on the
vehicle that gave them title to the vehicle.  Otherwise they couldn't
legally sell it.  What sort of paperwork did they give you?

Picture this scenario:  Your beloved bus is stolen and abandoned on
someone's property.  They have the vehicle towed.  The tow company
then sells your bus to another person.  Does that person have legal
ownership of the vehicle?  Not unless the tow company took ownership
of the vehicle in payment for services rendered (tow and storage
fees).  In order to do this, they must make a reasonable effort to
find the owner of the vehicle.  If they did this, then they are the
legal owner and should have a title for the vehicle.

At least that's the way it works here on the Left Coast.  Other states
may be considerably different (particularly if you are friendly with
the local lawman!)
