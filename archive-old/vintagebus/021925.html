In a message dated 98-10-21 20:38:49 EDT, you write:

&lt;&lt; If the clutch is properly adjusted, you won't need any clips at all, once
hte
 motor is installed -- there shouldn't be enough room 'twixt TO bearing and
 pressure plate to allow it to fall off...   &gt;&gt;
Hi Jeff,
The problem with this is that you will have to keep the clutch throw out
bearing in contact with the pressure plate at all times.  This would mean that
you would have to turn your VW on it's nose to keep the throw out bearing in
place due to you not using the clips, while you installed the engine.
Otherwise the bearing will fall out while you install the engine.  Also having
the bearing in contact with the pressure plate constantly will wear out the
bearing prematurely.  This is why VW had the bearing adjusted to keep it 1/8&quot;
away from the pressure plate and strongly advised against resting your foot on
the clutch pedal.    Eric &amp; Barb
