&lt;&lt; I marked my back tires, rolled my car forward and marked the distance. I 
then let out air to reduce the radius by about 1/4&quot; and lo and behold, one

Hi Chris,
Which is why it is important to keep up your tires to proper pressure.  A 
tire, especially a radial run at lower air pressure is going to flex in a 
upside &quot;U&quot; shape where the tread is against the pavement.  Resulting in the 
sides of the tread wearing badly while the center of the tread still look 
brand new and probably causing a blow out of that tire due to flexing 
constantly.  Also there is going to be a certain amount of flex outward at 
higher MPH that will on the other hand increase the tire diameter from a 
sitting measurement.
 
&lt;&lt; If I am right, then all the previous freeway flier and standard 
calculations are out the window. The correct calculation will use the radius, 
not the diameter.  &gt;&gt;
If you are talking about running just one or both of the rear tires at lower 
pressures than rated then this is true, but if you mean all four then the 
speedo MPH _at_ RPM is going to be the same.  The speedo does not count how many 
feet/yards/miles you have gone, but how many time the left front tire has 
turned.  In otherwords if you install a 25 or 26 or 26.5&quot; set of diameter 
tires on your speedo to engine RPMs in each gear are going to read exactly 
the same.  Yes, these changes in tire diameter is going to change how fast 
you get from point A to point B.  Plus the fact that some if not alot of the 
VW speedos are going to be a little out of calibration after 30+ years.  What 
these calucations are really good for is to see the changes in the gearing 
especially if one figures all four forward gears at 1,500 and 3,000 RPM with 
a 4.375, 4.125 and 3.875 R&amp;Ps.  To not only avoid high RPMs in fourth on long 
distance travels, but to prevent large gaps between the gears.
