Subject: Chrome bumpers and shipping???

--part1_fc.1526d1b5.29c4dc85_boundary

I am looking for a set of chrome bumpers for my 59 panel.  The paint is being 
sprayed next week and I told him to squirt the bumpers as well.  But I have 
to have the chrome bumpers, my baby won't be complete without them.  So I 
need to know who has them? (new or used)  how much?  and how do we get them 
over to Germany, container, etc.... I will be excited with just the chrome 
blades front and back, no fancy chrome riders, etc... I need help guys and 
gals......
