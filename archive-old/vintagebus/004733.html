&gt;could you answer some of my questions?&gt;
&gt;i live in britain and go to vanfest each year and as i am now old enough to
&gt;drive i am looking for a splitty.  fourtunately i've been given around
&gt;£4,000 by an aunt. could you point me in the direction of a decent place to
&gt;start looking for one?&gt;

Hi thom .. oops better be changing that name..   he bites!  ;)

best bet for you is to 1, join the split screen van club.. Uk.

ring terry ellis on - 01926 814860  or email terry_at_ellis814freeserve.co_dot_uk
but dont expect any quick response there.. best to ring my guess.
and check out the mags - volksworld and total vw.. sometimes you can find a
split or 2 on www.loot_dot_com
ssvc also do a rapid ad thing - join up and find out about that -- pay a
tenner and get early updates to the classifieds.  be there first and all
that.
you could try asking on edubs list to see if anyone knows of sales too.

&gt;also, how much does it cost and how easy is it to lower a
&gt;splitty's&gt;suspension?
about pretty much free if you can do it yourself..  just time consuming..
if you want it adjustable.. add at least 100
if you want someone to do it add 250- 500. just the front will cost about
two thirds of these if you get it done.

good luck
