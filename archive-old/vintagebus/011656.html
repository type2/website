Subject: Sunroof

&gt; From: Steve Urchison &lt;urchison_at_islandart_dot_com&gt;

&gt; 1) Are the blocks that slide in the roof channel supposed to be
&gt; wood.  If so does anyone make reproductions (or does any one need
&gt; a set, they look easy to make!)

Originals are of a wood composite material, like a very thick
masonite.  They have a tendency to delaminate if wet for any
length of time.  I considered making replacements of solid nylon
block--which would slide easily and not be affected by water.
Turns out mine weren't so bad and I just put them back in.

&gt; 2) Can you use the -'63 sunroof handle on a '64-'67 front locking
&gt; bow?  The bows seem the same other than the handle, but not sure.
&gt; (the bow that came with the van is really rusted.)

Seems to me that the _Parts_List_ shows pretty much the same
parts for the whole split window run.  My book may not go back
far enough, but I think eariler handles will fit (clara, you have
the older Parts List, right?)

&gt; 3) Has anyone installed a sunroof cover?  The one I got from
&gt; W.C.M. has no instructions, and the pictures in the Bentley are
&gt; kind on lacking.  Any tips would be appreciated.

I had an upholstery shop actually attach the cover to the front
bow. I did the rest.  There is one key element in attaching the
cover to the front bow.  On the bottom/front lip of the front
bow, there should be a thin bead of rubber weatherstrip that goes
between the metal bow and the cover fabric.  When the sunroof is
closed, this hidden W/S forms the seal at the front of the
sunroof to keep water from blowing in as you drive.  Most
crucial.

From the front bow back, it's fairly straight forward.  Install
the rear bow bolts loosely at first.  Then close the roof and see
if it's too tight or too loose.  The holes in the rear of the
fabric should be oval (or at least round/big enough to slide it
back and forth under the rear bow that screws to the rear metal
roof.  You may get lucky and have it fit the first time, or you
may have to fit and adjust until you're satisfied.  Each time
you'll have to remove the top of the front bow so you can fold
back the cover to expose the top of the screws in the back bow.

Once that is done, the small screws/brackets on each side are
fairly simple.  There are two pieces of metal sticking out there;
one is the bow itself, one is a thinner and shorter piece on top
of each side.  This top piece fits into the cover, so the cover
has to have a slit cut (about an inch).  There should be two sewn
seams on the outside of the cover.  The slit should be cut
through ONE THICKNESS ONLY from the underside about 1/4&quot; from the
inner seam.  Make sure you know what I'm talking about before
cutting the cover!

Once all pieces are in place, the screw goes through:

1) Finish (cone) washer
2) Top layer of fabric
3) Short bracket
4) Bottom layer of fabrick
5) Into bottom bow

&gt; 4) I have to replace the two strips of  &quot;rubberized canvas&quot; that
&gt; run down the outer side of the bows. Are the bows supposed to be
&gt; a certain distance apart and is each one spaced equally from the
&gt; front to the back

I know the pieces.  Seems I reused my old ones so the screw holes
were already there.  I'd have to go look at mine again to really
remember how that is done.

Hope this helps some.  I can get more specific if necessary, just
need time to go out and check mine to be sure.

Good Luck.
