Aloha,

&quot;Ice Pick&quot; or button....

I just bought a '65 Kombi and the drivers door has a button on the
handle.... the passenger door has an older(?) &quot;ice pick&quot; on it....

I just started this &quot;PROJECT&quot; and this has been bothering' the hell
outta me... I like the &quot;ice pick&quot; but (not that I'm going stock , this
week) which is proper?

And by the way... where do you get 'em? I've just been on the net and
have gotten a few catalogs but nobody seems to offer the handles???

Many more Q's to come... And I promise I'll keep the pipe down while
corresponding ;-)

Really!

Aloha and Mahalo,

Doug Gibson,
'65 Kombi

    over the years... 

had a '67 bug
had a '68 bug
had a '72 Square back
had a '65 notchback
had a '72 fastback
had a '72 ghia (auto stick...what a freak that was!)
had a '71 panel

     wish I'd have keep a few!&amp;^%%^!
