I had to track down the previous owners as part of cleaning up the title on
my '56.  I ended up calling a lady in Sonora, who'd owned the bus for about
20 years.  She was older than dirt, but was still able to give me a little
history on the bus.  She was going to send pix, but they never
materialized.  She managed a small apartment complex, and had sold the bus
to one of her tenants, who died a short time later.
