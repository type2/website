You would be right between a lot of VW action. We are the Gorge VW club and we reach from Cascade Locks OR to Goldendale WA and actually have a few members from Portland. There is a super friendly and happening VW club in Yakima the Apple Valley Volksters or something like that. You wouldn't be surrounded
by stuff but you would be a close drive to a lot going on. You might also get first crack at some good deals out in that dry air.
Good luck,
Craig
the Gorge VW club
