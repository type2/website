&gt;I love the trip reports and all Dave, but ah...this much detail I could
&gt;do with out.  Ya know a lot of us are eating while reading out here!

Steve,

Sorry about all the &quot;potty-talk&quot;.  Ed was supposed to be doing travel 
restroom reports for Cletus at Splitzine so we were taking notes.  I 
left out my punchline at the end of the above paragraph.  There was 
supposed to be another sentence saying, &quot;Where are those restroom poll 
boxes when you need one?&quot;

I'll try to finish the trip report this week &amp; I promise to keep it 
&quot;clean&quot;.

Dave
