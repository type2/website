Subject: Almost lost the bus

Just a little story of my how this morning went.
   Woke up and was feeling good so i decided to take the bus down to the 
airport and watch planes. I was crusin downhill to an intersection.  went to 
apply the brakes and all i felt was the stop of the mastercylinder. No 
brakes at all! i forced it into second gear (it doesn't like going into 
second at 30MPH while pumping frantically. I got a little braking action, 
but not much. Thankfully I remembered the parking break. I ended up locking 
the tires up to get me stopped. Just in time before i slid out into the 
oncoming traffic. I slowly drove it out of the way into a parking lot, and 
went inside to check my pants. I wonder what happened? My brakes have never 
been the best, but never nothing like this.
I'm feeling better now, but just thinking of being side-swiped by that 
traffic going around 50 MPH bothers me.
