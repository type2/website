Subject: RE: [VB] Good place to order parts.

It sounds like you were ordering something wierd. Like maybe a left handed
metric widgit extractor with left and right side markers ? Both times I
ordered from Bus depot, they were quick, and the parts were right. I admit,
I haven't ordered millions of items from them, but I am DEFINATELY a
satisfied customer because I still drive my daily driver because of those
parts.

  Recently I ordered some parts from busdepot_dot_com. It was terrible. They 
sent the wrong stuff(actually screwed up the order so bad it was pathetic) 
and weren't the most coperative with me trying to straighten out the order 
and get what I needed. I need a place that will take care of me and send the

correct parts out quickly. Don't mind paying the price it takes.
Thanks
John
