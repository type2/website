Subject: clear needle 80mph speedo on ebay

http://cgi.ebay_dot_com/aw-cgi/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&amp;item=229839857
Here is an actual good deal on Ebay (at least for now). I am in no way
attached or involved or even have a clue who this guy is. I do know that
the clear needle bus 80mph is a bit of a rarity. I have one in my Double
cab for coolness sake. I would go for it but I don't really need it and it
is a very short lived speedo. It would be cool to see it go in the right
bus.
Good luck,
Craig
