Just wanted to share!  The &quot;Amazing Yard Engine&quot; just got back from being
rebuilt.  For those that don't know, this engine is one that Dave Easterwood
more or less found in his yard, and I proceeded to put 25000 miles on it
without any trouble.  Alarming amounts of sludge came out the first two oil
changes, but after that no problems...

The time finally came not so long ago to retire the Kombi.  I was pondering
rebuilding the engine since it was in more or less unknown condition, but it
was still running well.  I did a compression check, and the numbers came out
like this:

1 - 100
2 - 120
3 - 90
4 - 80

The numbers made me go ahead and do it.  With all the other work I had to do on
the bus, plus school, plus moving shortly, I decided to pay someone else to do
the work for me.  Ron Hunter got my transmission, and he got the engine too.

Basically it's a stock 1600DP with a few modifications.  I had a counter-
weighted crank put in, and the case is now full-flow.  Besides the CDI
and Pertronix, that's it.  After the break-in period (I'm giving it 3K miles)
both the tranny and the engine will be switched to synthetic lubrication.

The rebuild itself was pretty uneventful, according to Ron.  The cam was worn
out as were the lifters, so they were replaced.  The lifters were so worn they
were dished inward slightly!  The case had been bored by an unknown PO .002,
and did not require any more work.  The flywheel I had replaced before I put
the engine into service; it was rusted on the sealing edge causing leaks.  The
one I used was marginal, but I needed to get to Cleveland so I used it anyway.
This was also replaced with a better one during the rebuild.

Question time!  There's only one really.  It's about the oil filter mount.  
Does anybody have a place they like to mount theirs?  I don't know how generic
these are, mine is in a &quot;Bugpack&quot; package.
