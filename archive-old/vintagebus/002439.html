&gt; It's a bench seat, two part, but the connection between the front
&gt; and back is the only one.  There is no distinction between the back
&gt; and the bottom, thus I can't look behind the seat.

&gt; Jeff,
&gt;
&gt; If it is the original seat, it should be in two sections.  1/3 (driver)
&gt; 2/3(passanger).  Its a bench seat...right?  The passenger seat will tilt
as
&gt; a
&gt; unit forward hinged at the base of the front part of the seat.  Grab the
top
&gt; of the seat (2/3rds section) and tilt it forward. Look closely and you'll
&gt; see
&gt; how it works.  The spare is directly behind the seat.

&gt; &gt; On second look, I think it's a standard.  It just doesn't
&gt; &gt; have the pop-outs for the 2 door or opposite windows, but
&gt; &gt; it does have middle and rear seats, unlike a combi.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I can't find a way to get behind the front seat, as the base
&gt; &gt; of the back just won't come up.  Oh yeah, I don't have a VIN
&gt; &gt; on paperwork, as there wasn't any paperwork.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Now that I take a closer look at some details, the windshield
&gt; &gt; wipers are locked in one position, straight up!  Nothing
&gt; &gt; short of breaking them will make them move however, oh well.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; It does have totally clear front turn signal lenses tho.
&gt; &gt; Odd very wide front license plate holder, standard shape on rear.

&gt; &gt; Jeff '66 Standard 1/19 Solido
&gt; &gt; presented as a Combi
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt; &lt;&lt; I just got fixing my new bus!
&gt; &gt;  It was presented as a '66 Combi, with a two
&gt; &gt;  tone paint job, white over red.  The interior panels
&gt; &gt;  are the cheapo ones, no pop-outs, so it's a kombi.
&gt; &gt;  No uprights or overriders for the bumpers either.
&gt; &gt;  The right mirror arm is broken off, but the original
&gt; &gt;  driver side one is round.  It has all of the seats!
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Strange muffler that starts correctly out the side,
&gt; &gt; but then goes straight back.  Oh well.
&gt; &gt; One wiper arm is a little bent too.
&gt; &gt; All of this for just seven and half!
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I had to do some dis-assembly &amp; re-assembly to get
&gt; &gt; the front seat re-installed properly, but it went
&gt; &gt; pretty easy.
