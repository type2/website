&gt; I understand stock-but what is a dampner and tip(. does this attach before or
&gt; after the muffler? how does it affect horsepower? does it affect engine temps?
&gt; or for that matter does the type of exhaust you use affect engine temps?
&gt;

Kevin,

Its all part of the stock system.  You have the muffler that attaches to
the heads/heater boxes which has a single outlet on the left side. 
Attached to that is a long tube with some sound absorbing material
inside.  It attaches to the muffler outlet makes a 90 degree bend to the
left and is braced back to the muffler with a bracket.  Finally you
attach a tip witch is like a 90 degree elbow which bends to the left and
points straight back (perpendicular to the axis of the bus)

Check out the online bentley or better yet buy one!  Or check out the
parts manual on Thom's site.

Go here http://wow.atlasta_dot_net/~mriluvu/oacdp/5867part.html#q2  and
download &quot;group 2&quot;.  With Acrobat you can zoom in on the picture of the
entire stock set up. Look at image 195
