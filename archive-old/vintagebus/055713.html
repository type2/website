So by your &quot;story&quot; either the orig owner who only
owned it for a year, or the lil old lady, who wouldn't
have been that old in 59, cut the wheel wells? I can't
believe in your story you didn't track down the og
owner who still hade the hoops and tilt for it.
 
I love a tall tale.
  Mike


Only
&gt; bummer is the rear
&gt; wheelwells are cut and desert tires are on the back.
&gt; Real faded unpainted
&gt; dove blue paint.  Then she
&gt; brought me the Original NV 1958 title sighed by bank
&gt; and org owner and never
&gt; put in anyone else name, she only drove it around
&gt; the desert and never did
&gt; anything with title. By the dates she bought it on
&gt; May 14 1959.
