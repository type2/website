Subject: RE: [VB] Re: steering box gear oil



	Thanks to all that responded to this Email. I put the new
steering box in and a new drag link in just in case and it drives like a
dream. No more 1/4 turning of the wheel just to correct my direction. I
tell you what that it sure gave me a work out each day when it was windy
coming home from work.


Thanks again
Eric Lykens

	Can someone tell me what type of oil I can put in my steering
box. It is a 1965 gear box and I was going to put GL4 in it (Yes/No). 


Thanks for your time
Eric Lykens
