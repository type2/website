Hi there I tried using a roll pin in a similar situation on a thing deck
lid and it froze up in two months. I ended up going to a local farm
implement dealer and they had a pin that worked, and looked stock. It
was a john-deere dealer and they had a large selection of these pins out
on the sales floor. Hope this helps!!

I got a beat-up VW bus for my girl-friend. It was a very good trade!!!
