Subject: Re: [VB] 54 Barndoor

&gt; Hi list, nice to have you back. Has anyone else been drooling on that 54
&gt; barndoor advertised on the samba? I have been, any opinions or comments
&gt; would be appreciated ( good deal ? ). Also would being 6'4&quot; be a problem
&gt; as far as being able to look out through the windshield. It's not really
&gt; a problem in my 60's buses but I saw that factoid about barndoor windows
&gt; being shorter and got worried. Is the roof lower too or are the windows
&gt; just shorter? Any tall people out there with barndoors?
&gt;
I'm 5'10&quot; or so and I can't sit back in my '55 Barndoor Kombi unless I sit
back and slouch.  I drive leaned over the wheel which  is how I normally
drive anyway so it doesn't matter to me.
