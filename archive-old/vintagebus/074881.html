Subject: preheat tube into air cleaner?

Hi All,
I've now scraped the skin on my unprotected skull 4 times (yes, it's
numb) against the tip of the air cleaner snout trying to find where to
run a heat tube from so i can preheat my incoming air (there's a
fitting for that on the air cleaner next to the crankcase ventilation
tubefor which, BTW, i still have not found an elegant routing).
Or, in plain english, from where does that tube run? A search of the
archives yielded the remark that it came from the warmest part of the
engine, between #'s 3 and 4 cylinders, near the thermostat. Unless i've
got some weird tin, there's no apparent fitting there. A spark plug
hole with bootie, a manifold, another spark plug hole.
What am i missing?
TIA,
Andres
ps, would someone please confirm that it is a really bad idea to stick
my spare gas can into the area between the left rear fender well and
the left tail light? I'm sooo tempted. Fits really nicely if i aim the
air cleaner snout at the vent instead of at my (did i say bald ?)
skull. I need the can because the DPM removed the reserve valve from
the fuel tank when they  put in a newer higher capacity tank. They also
put in a '67 VDO fuel gauge which i consider digital: It's either
marking 3/4 or it's empty. No in-between. Since i've only had the bus
for a few days i still haven't gotten the hang of calculating mileage
by distance travelled, especially since i sometimes climb that mountain
pass...
