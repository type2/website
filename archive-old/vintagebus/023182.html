Ow!  My neck!  I can't work, I'm in constant pain...

There's 3 ambulance teams sitting around, drinking beer, swapping stories.  
The first driver says &quot;Ever since we added a GPS to our ambulance, we've
improved our response time 10%!&quot;  
The second one says &quot;That's nothing, we added a neural network guidance
system, coupled with real-time traffic pattern analysis, and we improved
response time 25%!&quot;
The third one says &quot;Whatever.  Ever since we hired a lawyer to do the
driving, our response time has improved 75%!&quot;

&gt;hi all,
&gt;
&gt;on teh way back from Eureka springs i was rear ended...
&gt;
&gt;put a dent in the left rear corner (if you go to my pix page you can see
&gt;the rear shot in the first line and second line are before and after pix)
&gt;
&gt;Its not that big a deal i suppose, just another damn dent i have to
&gt;remove...
&gt;
&gt;I was just upset as i thought it woudl be much worse than it is...
&gt;
&gt;So, what do you all think, should i claim it or not? cut the scatterbraind
&gt;collider some slack or make them pay...
