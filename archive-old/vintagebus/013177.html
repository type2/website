I have been doing this ever since I had to pay $17 for a 6V headlight bulb, unfortunately I haven't seen many 6V buses in junk yards lately.  I have been diging through my swap stuff to pull out the 6V bulbs.  Sure glad I bought those 6V semaphore bulbs a few years back.

is probably why we have always picked up bulbs out of wrecking yards.  That 
way the cost is nearly nothing and we were there anyway buying other parts.
