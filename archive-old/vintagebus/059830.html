Interior was rough to say the least. &quot;Z&quot; Bed was some kind of tubing =
thing that needed legs propped. Table was very rough, but salvageable, =
has a weird curve, wider at the hinge. No cabinets except wardrobe and =
it's rough. Roof is good, but it's a panel with 6 flange one piece crank =
out windows .  You might be able to put together one good one from all =
of 'em. Maybe two upper aluminum window brows are useable. No front =
bench seat. The nose is in good shape with only one towel bar dent, rear =
corners abused, one good outie engine inlet with scoop holes. Didn't =
look under for rot behind the bumpy front bumper. Holes in driver's =
floor, rusted rockers on the passenger side. Probably a useable front =
beam and the big nut rear if anyone really wants it. Bits and pieces are =
in custody, rear window, rear hatch latch, apron, front window tops, =
handles, knobs, speedo, gas guage, turn signal, headlight assys, etc.=20

 -Harry in Fresno

&gt;Harry and I found a 63 panel camper conversion in the Fresno Pick a =
part.
&gt;Appears to have been a Sundial. Not much left on it. Yesterday and =
today was
&gt;1/2 price sale days. About the only thing left worth saving is the =
[wrong]
&gt;later model large nut transaxle with reduction boxes.
&gt;The bus appears to have come from San Jose Calif. It is cream colored. =
Any one
&gt;know of it?
