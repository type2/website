 hey all,
 i have been keeping an eye out for parts and cant really seem to come up 
 with much... so ill ask the experts. i have some time on my hands 
 considering my engine is getting rebuilt and its still 35 and snowy here. 
 (its was actually 66 degrees today! but snow will be on the ground when i 
 wake up tomorrow) anyway, the metal strip that holds the adjusting star in 
 place is the part in question here. only one of four corners of my bus has 
 them. what happens to them? do they break? fall off? it is VERY frustrating 
 to have to adjust them every other week cuz they (shoes) keep backing off. 
 last time i had the wheels off i didnt really check them out to see if you 
 can just put some new ones in. anyone??
 
 thanks,
  &gt;&gt;
 Where do the brake star clips go?

they get eaten by the brake monsters.   

the fronts are easier to replace- I have attached them with little screws.  
as each was rivited on with twoi rivet.

the rears are trickier, by you can take the piece that holds the stars of and 
use one that has the clip.  early bats use the same clip/star holder, though 
not the same backing plate

I haven't made them, so far, but have a strips of thin spring steel set aside 
for when I next run into the problem and need some, to see how making them 
goes.
