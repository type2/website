&lt;&lt; I used the Wolfsburg West ones.  They look nice, and have only minimal
 warping after sitting outside under  covered storage.  I could have avoided
 some of the warping by using more screws. &gt;&gt;

Ditto that - Very good stuff.  I would suggest painting the back of the panel 
with enamel paint or something to reduce the warping - that is what I did on 
my second set, it helped.
