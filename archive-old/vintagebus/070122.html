Subject: Re: [VB] Vents... latches and whistling

On my old Chevy pickup, the drivers vent window whistled. It was driving me nuts. An old mechanic
showed me a trick. He put a penny on the frame where the latch sits and then closed the latch.
Whistle gone.

Never seen a broken latch on a Chevy truck. Guess its good they aren't made in Brazil.

Bus content. I've got one. It's not running. I'm bummed.

The tipper vent on the driver side whistles... with og seals, but the
pass side doesn't.  The v80 seals don't whistle but then again, reaching
45+ miles/hr is a rarity :-O

Oh, I just posted up a picture of the differences between the bug and
bus latches...
