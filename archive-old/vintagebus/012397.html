Yes! The picture at http://www.ruf.rice_dot_edu/~krg/ looks just like the
&quot;original&quot; door panels and frames out of the EZ Camper conversion that I
have in the '63 bus that I have been blathering on about lately. I suspect
that it could be similar to some of the 'Sundials' that people claim to
have. The true Sundials that I have seen seem to be a schosh nicer, interior
wise, than the EZ's. Usually very similar to the EZ's but maybe with
aluminum edging on the cubby doors. My EZ only has the Hacksaw Harry bare
edges on the cubby doors. Kinda talking out of spots other than my face at
this point.

Panel is the keyword here. A Kombi style body will have recessed window
areas already formed into the body and cargo doors. Therefore those
doorpanels will be covering only the lower half of the cargo doors and the
main wall. The lovely ;-) full length door panels are necessary in the
conversion of the commercial (Panel) vehicles and cargo doors in order to
hide the nasty looking hacked holes that were cut into the (panel bus) doors
and main wall. Check your VIN tag. My bet is that somewhere there will be a
211 number somewhere or at least a 21XX in the second set of numbers on the
last line of the Mcode tag. Is that set of numbers 2113? I will double down
on the bet and guess that the paneling covers from floor to ceiling along
the far wall in the main cabin/cargo area.
Have fun and run what you got!,
