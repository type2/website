Subject: sticky clutch lever
Message-Id: &lt;v03110700b37133a000a5_at_[38.28.67.99]&gt;

OK heres the new problem (it seems to be at the rate of 1 prolbem a week :)
I was driving to work this morning and All of a sudden, I realized that the
clutch seemed to be slipping because the rpm's would go way up when you
released the clutch then it would gradually clutch in and the speed would
increase and rpm's drop.... So ok I think to myselfe That Im going to have
to drop out the engine again and fix the stupid clutch... then I was later
looking at the lever it's self and realize it wasn't returning properly and
you could pull it up and get the clutch to work fine when your driving...
Itook some WD-40 to the bolt holding the lever to the body and had Alisa
work the clutch while I was applying  it, It loosened it up a little but
not nearly as much as I would have liked. it still sticks just enough to
affect the action of the clutch. I want to fix it as soon as I can because
I dont like the thought of burning the clutch all the time! If anybody has
had any experiance in this area I would be extreamly greatful to any
information!
Thanks a lot
