To everyone one the list...
The very best of the holiday season to all my VW friends.
From Quebec to South Africa and everyone in between.
I wish you all health, happiness and many happy hours behind
the wheel.
You have all added immeasurably to the richness and enjoyment
of my favorite hobby and obsession. Your daily dialogue reflects
the diversity, experience, frustration and happiness that nurturing
these anachronistic, tempermental and completely wonderful
vehicles brings to each of our lives, and I thank you all for sharing.
Here's to another year on the road under air-cooled power.
Fondly,
John Flowers
Northern Illinois, USA
