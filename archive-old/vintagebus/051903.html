Subject: RE: [VB] FW: BBBB6   Busses and Buzzes By the Bridge 6

   The message below Thom's WAS NOT written by me (Ronnie  old volks of az)
but forwarded on one of my computers.
   To clear matters up BBB was very mellow and the problem happened WELL
after all guest had left.
   BBB IS a family  event and those there in attendance can attest to that.


Ronnie  London Bridge Bullis    BBB VII only 361 days away!

(*sigh*) 

It just ain't a VW show unless someone's stoned/drunk/tweaking/tripping.  
It's good to see someone is keeping the tradition alive - *not*
