Subject: Re: [VB] truck drivers on my road trip :(

&gt; &gt; &lt;&lt;As long as you were staying in the right lane no one
&gt; &gt; has any right to be mad at you.&gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I disagree with you to some extant. Though I do feel it is proper to
&gt; &gt; move to the right lane when driving slower. But even in the right lane,
&gt; &gt; a speed that is drastically lower than the overall flow pattern can be a
&gt; &gt; hazard.


I have run into what I have heard referred to as a &quot;TRUCK STORM&quot; a few times..
I-81 in VA. is the worst I have felt,, as I wasn't able to drive as fast as the
trucks,, who insisted on getting right on my rear bumper before changing
lanes,,  I noticed this was way worse at night ,,, 

I took some reflector red tape and stuck it to 3 fridge magnet strips,, then I
stick it on the rear hatch in the shape of a farm vehicle sign,, SLOW MOVING ,, 

this has dramatically increased the space that the big trucks leave when they
change lanes to get around me!

:-)  I used this sign set up during a rain storm once,, and a Bus following me
commented that that was about the only thing that was visible through the fog
and downpour

just my 1.6 cents canadian eh!
