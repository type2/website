Copper's softer than the aluminum alloy the head's made of.  I use a
dental pick, get underneath it and work it up gently.  If that doesn't
work I'll try and deform it in the same radius as the manifold port with
a screwdriver, using my hand as a hammer and making sure I don't contact
the head with the screwdriver.  It's not hard, just be careful of what
you're trying to save.  It also helps to have a rag in the port if the
head's on the engine so you don't accidentally drop something inside. 
The port should be shiny silver.

looked at the intake port on the head, it appears that there
 is a (much flatter) copper seal in there already
