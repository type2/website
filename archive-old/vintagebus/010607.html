&lt;&lt;  it won't start unless you pump the gas a couple times, then hold it 
completely on the floor until started. If you just pump the gas while turning 
it over, then it won't start. This even happens after it's been well warmed 
up. I have tried adjusting the idle 
 and mixture screws, but to no avail...  Also, the bus gets like 12 miles per 
gallon, which is horrible...  It runs fine (other than the gas mileage) once 
you start it, doesn't stall out or anything. &gt;&gt;

Hi Volks,
Definitely sounds like way too much fuel!  Probably doing wonders washing out 
the piston rings.  Check/replace your carb reseviour shut off valve and do 
the same to the float in there.  The latter could have a hole in it causing 
it to sink or it could just be too heavy.  Also recheck the fuel pump push 
rod for proper hieght or if using an electric pump only run it with a fuel 
pressure regulator ste to about 2-3 Lbs. per sq. inch.  Also check you carb 
jet sizes!
