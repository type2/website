ok, i got my 1600 single port all together and 
running, kinda. i've spent the last 3 days screwing with it, trying to get it to 
idle. i have tried 3 different carbs, 2 german 30 pict 1, and 1 brosol h30/31 
(just for grins), 2 different known good distributors, and 2 different known 
good coils. the 30 pict 1's--one was on the engine i was driving about 3 months 
ago, and had no troubles with. i did re-bush the throttle shaft because it felt 
a slight bit loose, now it's fine again. the other one was unknown, so i 
completely rebuilt and checked it, so i'd guess i had about a 75% chance of it 
working with adjustments once on the car. it ran good with that carb for a 
while, but the accelerator pump was leaking, so i took it off, replaced the 
outer part of the pump, put it back on, then it ran like crap, aka wouldn't idle 
well. i never got the brosol to work.

basically the problem is a bad idle. once it hits 
the midrange and up it runs freakin' great. good power, no misses, and the plugs 
(after 75+ miles) all look very good--light brown on the center ceramic and the 
electrode looks clean.

when i remove the spark plug wire from #2 at idle, 
nothing really changes. when i pull #'s 1,3,it is immediately noticeable that a 
cylinder isn't firing. when i reattach #2, it picks up for a brief second, then 
it goes back to idling on 3 cylinders. #4 when the wire is removed, isn't quite 
as bad as #2, but it does drop off rhythm when removed for sure.

at idle, it sounds like it's only hitting on 3 
cylinders out of the exhaust, and the engine visibly appears to be not idling 
smoothly.

i have checked the timing numerous times (german 
009 dist that is in good working order with a known good pertronix. i also tried 
a points set up in a different distributor with the same results) and it is 
set at the mark between 7.5 and 10 degrees btdc, where i have set if for 
years.

plug wires give a nice blue spark when removed from 
the plugs. the plugs are new, old stock german bosch 145T1 (w8ac today). i 
thought #2 may be bad somehow, so i did change that one, no 
difference.

the valves have been checked and rechecked 3 times 
(due to removing the rockers twice). i did have a &quot;problem&quot; with what i thought 
was too much space between the rockers and the valves, so i installed lash caps 
to make up the difference. i thought they may have contributed to this idle 
problem, so i removed them to see. it made no difference, so i put them back on 
to make up some space. the initial valve adjustment after running in did not 
change, so it's not like lobe or lifter has gone flat.

i have tried 3 different sets of intake manifold to 
head gaskets. i have tried putting 2 gaskets per head as well, as suggested by a 
local vw shop owner. nothing changed any time i tried.

the manifold, as far as i can tell, DOES NOT 
HAVE A VACUUM LEAK!! so please don't jump to the conclusion that there is a 
vacuum leak. i THOROUGHLY checked the manifold before even installing it, 
because i really didn't want to have to change it again in the future. the one i 
had before did have a crack, which made me check this one very very carefully. 
yes, it is a 1500/1600 manifold, not a 1300 manifold. i filed the carb flange to 
assure a smooth face when the carb was installed. i even put water in the heat 
riser tube and laid the manifold upside down overnight to make sure there wasn't 
a pipe to pipe leak. there are no cracks or leaks in it. i cannot detect 
any vacuum leaks with carb cleaner.

i have tried various jets in all the carbs. it did 
idle better with a 65 pilot jet. it idles the &quot;best&quot; with a 65 pilot jet, a 145 
air, and a 120 main. although the air jet doesn't really affect idle, that's 
what's in it. bigger/smaller mains made no difference. believe me, i've tried. 
fuel pump works properly.

so again, i'm back to a bad idle. the carbs i've 
tried have been cleaned thoroughly. it all seems to lead back to #2 not firing 
at idle. oh yeah, compression is: 135, 135, 140, 130 respectively. i have tried 
EVERYTHING and ANYTHING i can possibly think of, barring a manifold change. i'm 
hoping it's something more simple than that. i did have it idling very well for 
about an afternoon, until i removed the carb to replace the accelerator pump 
diaphragm. no, i did not drop anything down the manifold. i have looked into the 
intake part of the head when i've replaced the gaskets both times and there 
isn't anything stuck down there.

so why won't #2 fire? please, ANY suggestions would 
maybe help me sleep better tonight. i feel like i have checked all the basics 
and beyond more than enough times, but maybe i'm missing something even more 
obvious than what is right in front of my face.
