&lt;&lt; Looking thru the july vw trends I found an ad from Kustom 1 Warehouse with 
a 61-67 bus trans for &quot;only&quot; $195.00 each. Has anyone ever bought one of 
their units and if so was it a good unit? Any other sugestions. &gt;&gt;
Hi Mereidith,
As always you get what you pay for.  Unless you are looking at 
pulling/pushing your bus home as fun and theripudic then get the tranny 
rebuild by a repuidible tranny rebuilder.  Like Todd Hill and get the freeway 
flier if you plan to travel and run a 1500cc or larger engine.  Eric&amp;Barb
