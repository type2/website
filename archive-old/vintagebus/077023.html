&gt; Any special tricks for getting old tie rods out?

&gt; Mine are stuck pretty good...  I thought a good smack with a big hammer 
&gt; would snap them out, nope.

when I replaced the tie rods on my 66 I used a 3/2 jaw gear puller. I
was able to get it on all ends except for the drag link. To get that
one off I pulled the arm from the steering box first and was able to
get to the drag link end that way. There is also a hazet tool out that
that will do all the ends easily, but I don't want to spend the cash
for that one tool. search the hazet site for the tool. Oh, also used a
lot of pb blaster. good luck
