&lt;&lt; Does anyone know how to tighten up the cab rear view mirror.  Mine is just 
flopping around and hangs straight down.  If I have to remove the glass, 
what's the hot tip for prying up the metal around the glass without 
destroying it?    Thanks.  Steve &gt;&gt;
Hi Steve,
You have to carefully pull the edge of the aluminuim mirror head away from 
the glass without prying against the glass and shattering it or chipping it.  
Going around and around over and over slightly bending the metal just a tiny 
bit at a time till just enough that it allows the glass to pop out.  Then you 
can see the spring metal piece that keeps the shaft ball in it's socket and 
keep the head of the mirror taunt.  Once you fix/repair whatever went wrong 
in there and maybe rechroming the mirror pieces you have to get the glass 
into the head by burnishing the metal back over the glass.  You can do this 
with a jewlers burnishing tool or in a pinch the side of a polished round 
screwdriver shaft.   Eric&amp;Barb
