&lt;&lt; Hmmm, what does this say about the hot-rodder's practice of wrapping the 
pipes in fiberfrax insulation?  They claim that this increases power, and 
more back-pressure certainly wouldn't do that! &gt;&gt;
Hi George,
   On the contrary!  The muffler on each and every internal combustion engine 
is designed for a certain amount of flow and back pressure.  Not enough back 
pressure and the engine runs too lean unless you jet it way rich to send 
flames out the tail pipe like on dragsters.  Which results in more gallons of 
fuel used than miles covered and an engine that preforms well only at way 
higher RPMs.  Several bus owners on this list have found this out by going 
from dual tipped headers to single tip or from header to stock muffler.  
Suddenly getting better HP and MPG.  Also we doubt that most VW hot rodders 
use 1-1/8&quot; internal diameter exhaust tubing on thier rigs.
   Back on 15DEC62 Vw started to issue thier type 1 and 2s with fresh air 
heating system and small snout on the front of each heater that matched the 
early body heater tube size of the pre-1964 type 1 &amp; 2 VWs.  Almost all of 
these small snout heater boxes J-tube inside have cast aluminum fins on the 
outside,but no fins on the inside surface.  Shortly before or with the advent 
of the larger post-1963 snouted heater boxes the J-tubes.  The outside of 
these J-tubes have cast on fins on thier exteriors AND fins/ribs pressed into 
the steel of the tubing inside this casting creating more surface area on the 
inside of these J-tubes.  VW made this change for a reason.
  Okay, fast forward to the future!  Danske a company in Europe has been 
making cheapie replacement heater boxes for  type 1 &amp; 2 for several years 
now.  They have the larger snout of the post-1963 heater, but have no 
internal fins/ribs on the inside steel J-tube cast into the aluminuim finned 
exterior.  Result is less heat transfer to heat your VW interior when needed 
and especially for engines bigger than a 1200cc these heaters cause higher 
engine temps and less HP!  
  We stopped in at Wolfsden in Redding and talked for a over an hour with 
Steve the owner there.  He had found the same problem with engines especially 
the bigger ones they had built with Danske heaters instead of original 
post-1963 heaters.
  The perfect air/fuel ratio jetting the higher the engine temp the more HP 
can be produced, but the main problem with engine materials now is that the 
pistons, heads, and valves tend to melt down too easily.  Which is why many 
companies and countries for the last two decades have been trying to create 
engines made of ceramic material which would easily sustain temps 1,000 F 
higher than what is commonly used now.  So for now we jet our pre-WWII 
technology reciprocating engines on the rich side and cause much more 
pollution and lower MPG.
  Since higher temps do not reduce HP we must at this time side on the back 
pressure solution to this puzzle.   Eric&amp;Barb
PS Have heard that Danske does make heat exchangers with internal fins, but 
these are more expensive than the ones you usually see.   EEE&amp;B
