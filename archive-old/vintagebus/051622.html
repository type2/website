&gt; I agree with Kevin about the deal Tom is giving out.  I couldn't afford
&gt; an arm and a leg, and I wanted a rack to honestly use ( You should see
&gt; what my mouse grey and white 62 standard looks like with a 20ft
&gt; fiberglass ladder lashed to the 6'0&quot; rack - talk about strange looks).  I
&gt; picked mine up in Deer Park en route to MT for a visit to my
&gt; father-in-law.  When I got there, I couldn't contain my smile, because it
&gt; was gorgeous.  Don't know what I expected.... but between usability and
&gt; price, I guess I expected something not as nice looking.  TOM CONNOR
&gt; ROCKS  If you want a rack that you can use and is durable, but don't
&gt; require stock (though his looks a lot like a rack on a 63 VW Rack ad I
&gt; have) there is no other option in my opinion.
&gt;
&gt; I'm in Aberdeen, WA BTW and travel frequently to both Seattle and
&gt; Portland.  If you want to see the rack in person, p-mail me and I'll let
&gt; you know next time I'm travelling.
&gt;
&gt; Wish I could be Tom's saleman, but they sell themselves, so who needs me?
