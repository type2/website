Subject: bus stalling

Hi...got a problem with my '65 bus. Relatively new engine(less than 1 year
old, not sure how many miles, I don't have my log book handy)

While driving down the road recently it stalled out on me...kind of like I
had run out of gas...the needle was kind of low, so I thought maybe I ran
out...it started up again, but kept stalling, so I made it the couple
hundred yards to the gas station. Filled it up(only ~7 gals)So I wasn't out
of gas. I then drove to my mechanic-problem still there. I could cruise
along fine for a little while, then all of a sudden the engine felt like it
just stopped...like maybe it ran out of gas...

So when I made it to my mechanic, it idled fine in his driveway while I told
him the problem. I also asked for a tune up, lube, oil change...etc.

He did all this, checked the choke, and checked the carb, when I went to
pick it up, he said he thought he got some dirt out of the carb, and that is
probably what was causing the problem. He also mentioned the tie-rod end(se
previous messages).

So it had been sitting in my driveway until I had time to order the tie
rods...but I decided I wanted to take it out the other night, I drove about
4-5 miles no problem, then the same problem returned. Stop/Go...unfor
another mile. I got out, had dinner with the family, then got back in the
bus to drive homw, and the whole way home-same problem. So I brought it back
to my mechanic, and we are trying to figure it out...he said he had it
idling in the yard for a while, with no problems...

My guesses:
fuel pump? But if it were bad, wouldn't it always be bad, and not
intermittent?
Very dirty carb(maybe one of the openings is getting stuck)?

Any suggestions?

thanks
