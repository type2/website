Rachel, Thanks for standing up for the Lunchwagen! I've got Greg and Thom
beat hands down. I'd hazard a guess that the Lunchwagen even has Mercury
beat on rust depth!

I am offering the list a formal apology...I had no idea when I sold Greg
his bus that he would go so overboard on the resto. Jeez...and here I
thought it was in decent condition! It was brought to my attention around
the campfire at BBBV that I have inadvertantly set loose a plague upon the
VW community in the form of Greg scrounging for parts that you never
thought anyone would scrounge for. In my defense I have to say that it was
sold for a good cause.

I was going to make a joke that I actually have all of the parts that Greg
needs...but you just don't joke about that sort of thing. (note to Greg: i
DON'T)

Ok...my conscience is clear. Long live the Lunchwagen and the Zebra bus.
Long live the 55-56 Westfalia!

Scott
