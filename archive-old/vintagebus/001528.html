Well good grief - as soon as the plans were made, they got yoinked!  I got a
call from my buddy Dan tonight and he's not going to be able to go to the
Springfield show.  My plans were to ride with him down there, use his tent,
and campout at the KOA.  So right now my options are 1) drive down there by
myself  2)find a listee to go with  3)go to the Omaha show  4) don't go at
all and stay home and work on some projects.

Right now I'm leaning towards option 4 unless someone can convince me
otherwise. :-(
