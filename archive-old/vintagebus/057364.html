Subject: RE: [VB] Alternator light

&gt; OK, so I've grounded the wire and nothing happens.  I've checked the
&gt; connectors on both ends and they are good.  At this point do I have to run a
&gt; new wire from the engine to the dash?

No. More troubleshooting needed.  A test lamp or better yet a multimeter
would be good. You would want to check that there is 12 v on the other
side of the lamp, check that the lamp is good and you could check
continuity of the wire using the frame as common. could be the wire or
the lamp holder or the lamp or the wires or connection bringing the 12v to
the lamp....
