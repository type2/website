The Intriguing Bestseller by Jean Rosenbaum, M.D.

So, this book was left on my door and I found it when I returned with my new
'63 Crew Cab on Saturday!  Ah, the irony... I have since learned the
neighbor who left it, and I don't really know them, so I take it as their
way of introducing themselves and paying respect to my hobby.

The book is Copyright 1972 -- the year of the first VW that I purchased 18
months ago (a bug).  That got me started on the whole VW thing, I'm here to
stay.

Anyway... Page 22, from chapter &quot;Is More Horsepower Really More Happiness?&quot;

___&quot; Volkswagen buyers are a special group   When you buy a Volkswagen, you
don't just get a car; you also acquire a lot of friends--other Volkswagen
owners.  The Volkswagen is a way of life.  More than that, it is a
declaration of a certain attitude toward life and society.  The Volkswagen
owner is saying that he is concerned about economics, air pollution, and
good craftsmanship.  Volkswagen owners include students, professional
people, and executives as well as large number of older retired persons who
appreciate economy and ease of handling.  Creativity marks the Volkswagen
owners.  They usually take an intellectual and rational view of life.  They
are individualists.  A Volkswagen owner is almost fiercely loyal to his
&quot;bug&quot; and does not harbor secret wishes to own a Cadillac, a Thunderbird, or
a Continental. &quot;___

Ok, so we could re-write that last sentence to say:

__&quot;A Volkswagen owner is fiercely loyal to his &quot;bus&quot; and does not harbor
secret wishes to own a Caravan, a Explorer, or a Suburban&quot;__
