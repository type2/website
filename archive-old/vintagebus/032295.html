Hey David,

Well, the Orange County chapter of SV2s meets on the first Monday of each
month, and that falls on the 2nd of April. So, if you're still around...you and
anyone else in the area are invited to come by. It's about 1.5 hours from San
Diego, only in bad traffic for a little bit at the end...

Here's the info from the website...

SV2's Orange County Chapter Meeting : Strictly Vintage II's Orange County
chapter meets 1st Monday of every month, unless it's a holiday. Then it's the
following Monday. Come on down to Gustav's Jagerhaus in Orange at 6:00pm and
meet your fellow bus maniacs. No charge, unless you want to munch on great
German food! See you there. For more info call Fred at (714) 836-1265 or email
ocmeet_at_sv2s_dot_com. 


Hope to see you and anyone else there!

Scott
