It is so great to be driving along in Bartholomew, my '60 Doublecab,
pondering the possibility of making for a dry bus inside, using my
windshield wipers, which appear to be of the 6-volt variety in a 12-volt
bus, and work quite well as a result (although not for long, I
fear....conversion soon!), when I hear this chattering and jolting,
accompanied by crashing and clattering sound, which soon proved to be the
arms from the wiper motor to the shaft assembly detaching themselves with
verve and vigor.

So I drove without windshield wipers...wondering if all it would take to
seal the leak from my overhead vent is a vent flap seal, or would I have to
try to replace the seal on the body part as well.  I was also trying to
determine if the water &quot;flowing&quot; through my windshield corners is coming
under or over the glass, and whether the pop-out window (ya, the same one I
said was dry in an earlier post) was leaking through the glass to frame seal
or frame to body seal......and what about the incredible amount of moisture
that is collecting under/behind my back seat (henceforth known as &quot;the
bilge&quot;)....I made it home, no problem, and repaired the windshield
wipers.....then when I went into town, I got me some Rain-X...both the
exterior, and the interior stuff.

I know why the problem happened....the driver's side rod came out of its
socket (it just needed tightening) and then fouled the passenger side rod,
and popped it out....I was able to pop it all back together and torque down
the set screw for the driver's side rod.

Until I get the wipers switched to 12-volt, I'll use them sparingly....I
don't need them, really!

So:  Does anyone need this 6-volt motor/assembly and switch?  Ya wanna trade
it for a 12-volt unit?  I can steal a 12-volt unit from Mathilde, the
neglected '67 project, for now, but I think it would be best not to have to.
Other trades (if anyone's interested anyway) are cool...I don't know what I
need, besides everything, but hey...I thought I'd put it out there.

Oh, I suppose the bus will hold together until Spring....then it's weld and
Rust-Mort galore!  Yippee!
