Hi Scott,
Get rid of the extractor and get a stocker 1600 bus only muffler.  Unless you 
are drag racing way over 4,000 RPM or runing a 1776 or larger engine the 
extractor is a waste of $ and sucks fuel out of the engine due to not having 
the proper back pressure.  Then check you carb jetting and tach for your RPM 
at your cruising speed.  Best MPG and engine cooling for us happens about 
2,500-3,000 RPM.
