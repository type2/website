Subject: Re: [VB] clutch/flywheel question

Hi Dave,
A 40HP engine in a 1971 bus is going to be hugely under powered because of 
later higher gearing and heavier later bus.  It is only going to be drivable 
around a flat town, and forget getting onto the highway!  You will need a adapter 
plate bolted to the stock oil pump to hang the rear of the engine from the 
engine hanger.  As for the clutch, FW situation best to install a 6 volt 
starter, and remove the clutch release plate on the pressure plate so the clutch 
release lever arm tips ride on the later throwout bearing or you have to replace 
the throwout bearing and arm it hangs from.
