Hey John and Kyle and the rest of you out there,
    Its nice to know the spirit is still alive and if any of you are ever 
stuck somewhere near Benicia Ca. (bay area) gimme a ring and I will help in 
anyway I can. I am going to red barn on the 21st and would love to meet up 
with anyone that is going, I wish I was driving my 63 panel but its going to 
be a few more months....me and my girlfriend will be looking for you guys. 
Peace!

-Christian
