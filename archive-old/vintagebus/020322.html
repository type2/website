Subject: Sloppy Steering - was Tie Rod Replacement
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com (SplitWindows Rule/LagWagens Drool)

My bus's steering had been sloppy, and getting worse by the day
it seemed - one of the issues I wasn't eager to face 600 miles
or so to OCTO (that and a very nice sinus infection!)

I'd already bought new tie rods and drag link from Ronnie,
I just hadn't taken the time to put them in.  After a particularly
exciting drive home from work in the bus, I decided there's no
time like the present.

I'm unusually fortunate to have all of tools and materials at my disposal -
new pivot bushing kit &amp; reamer , new tie rods &amp; drag link - even a 
spare steering box, but mine's only a year or so old.

In short, I'm loaded for bear.

So, I get the belly pan off, and set to evaluating my steering play.
Hmm.  What's this?  The (un)safety wire I'd used to lock the 
castellated nut to the drag link was compromised - it had sheared,
and the nut was slowly backing off.  I tightend it down, tied it with
some heavier-duty wire, and now I've got Formula One steering.

And my new tie rods live to see another day on the shelf...
