Subject: Roof Rack Ladder

Hiya gang,
When I bought my full length roof rack a couple of years ago, it came with a
detachable ladder.  It's the type that has a round bar welded on, which fits
into the drip rail around the top of my Sundial camper.

When I bought it, I weighed 290 pounds, but have dropped down to about 170,
and so I'm wondering; how much weight will this ladder support?  Is there
still a chance of bending up the drip rail if I were to use it?  How much
weight will the drip rail support?  Any feedback would be helpful.
Ed
