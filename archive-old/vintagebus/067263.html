Subject: Re: [VB] rattling cargo doors

Open the doors and watch the check rods while you turn the handle.  Both 
should go up/down.  Check the other door.   I mean, you want all 4 check rods 
holding the door closed. I'd oil the mechanisms while you are at it, and make 
sure they move nicely.  and aren't loose on the door.

look at the thingy the rods catch on theres on up top and one below.   On my 
61 the rear bottom bit was rusted out, so I welded it back so it worked.

All that in place?  how old are your grey rubber seals?  Go to the junkyard 
and pull decent grey rubber out of a splitty there, and install it in your 
bus.

&lt;&lt; I vaguely recall someone describing how to fix rattling cargo doors. 
 Mine has noise coming from the door handle area as well as the long 
 verticle metal rods. Any ideas how you have dealt with that would be 
 appreciated.
