Subject: Re: [VB] VWOA Trademark Licensing Program


Well, Dave, c'mon. Until VWOA starts loading people into boxcars, 
gassing them, shooting them, etc. we might consider the Nazi rhetoric to 
be a little exaggerated.

For people who may be interested, here is what seems to me to be a 
nicely done tutorial on trademark law:

	http://www.iusmentis_dot_com/trademarks/crashcourse/

My read is that it isn't commercial exploitation/competition that VW is 
worried about; they're worried about the value of the marks being 
diluted. I am not a lawyer, though (a shortcoming for which I never tire 
of congratulating myself).

Does anybody know a journalist who cares about technology issues? What 
do I know, but I think this is just the richest story; if _Wall Street 
Journal_ or _Wired_ were to look into this, they might find that it is 
an incredibly interesting story about how very badly you (VWOA) can 
shoot yourself in the foot on the internet if you don't understand the 
medium. I think the license-for-free initiative is above-board, 
personally, but the continuing controversy shows what a spectacular hash 
VW has made of this whole thing. I can't think how they could have made 
the internet public more hostile toward them.
