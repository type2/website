Subject: RE: [VB] safari windows

CE sells parts.
Al




The safaris glass is smaller than the windsheild glass.   You would need

get safari frame, seal, windsheild glass, latches, dasg tabs, etc,
sounds
like close to a full set.  Sounds like you have the bits thewing nuts
thread

that
makes safaris would sell partial kits, could ask at least.
