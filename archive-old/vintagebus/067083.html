Hi Ray,
Pretty sure those were used on FI late 70s beetles.  We have collected about 
five of these fan shrouds so far for our future engines after we convert them 
for center carb control cables.  Since the USA emission standards of the late 
1970s was getting harder and harder to meet for the VWAC engine and this in 
turn was making these engines run hotter and hotter this ring seemed to be a 
try at increasing air flow into the shroud.  From what we have heard this 
ring increases air flow by reducing turbulance at the fan shroud opening.  
Much like the leading edge wing slats on those Australian crop dusters (As 
seen in the last &quot;Road Warrior&quot; movie.) that increases flow over the top of 
the wing for better lift at really low MPH air speed.
