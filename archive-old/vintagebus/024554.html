Subject: Bus progress (65 Samba)

A little update on the 65 Samba

As of right now, all of my windows and small parts are painted beige
grey.  I have painted the interior of the bus beige grey also,  That
turned out all right with the exception of 2 run's on the dash.  I have
yet to spray the top outside grey.  The lower red has been painted and
well....  It stinks.

For whatever reason, the paint did not flow at all.  I have all kinds of
orange peal on the lower red.  Kind of a bummer.  I have decided to sand
it all off and start over.  It will be less work to go in with 200-400
grid paper and reshoot it then to go over the whole bus with 1500-2000
paper and buff it out.  I do not want to hand buff all the door jam's
and such.  This will set me back about 10 hours of sanding.

One good thing though.  since HVLP gun's use MUCH less paint then i
thought, i have plenty of paint to reshoot with.  Maybe someone can
shead some light on why i orange pealed.  My thoughts are one of two.
Either the paint was too thick or the temperature affected the paint.

The paint i use is preaty much cut and dry on mixing.  I use only 5% by
volumn of reducer so there is not much room for error.  The reducer i
used was for 70-80 degree weather and it was in the 60's when i shot.  I
do not know if that is a big no-no.  any ideas?

Some parts i still need:
middle seat (2/3)
interior front door trim
dash clock bezzle

Thanks
Matthew
