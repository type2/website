&gt;Hey, that's not the tire that's blowing out on all those new SUV's (Ford
&gt;Expedition...I think) is it? You know...it's been on the national news the
&gt;last couple of days. Lots of accidindts with blowouts and roll-overs and
&gt;stuff. Just checking!

It could Very well be Rex but We Canadians sure haven't been hearing about 
it!. But anyways even though it might be the same model of tire i do not 
believe they will be the same size tire and it wouldn't be put under the 
same amout of prussure like on those huge SUVS (thats my therey). So anyways 
Take car during the long weekend ANd keep them Dubs rolling Sincerly Kirin
