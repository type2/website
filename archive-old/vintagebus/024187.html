Have you ever seen pictures of the statue of Justice, you know, the
blindfolded woman holding a set of scales? The blindfold represents
impartiality... something we could evidently use a bit more of...
	If you feel uncomfortable stopping for someone who appears to be broken
down or in need of assistance, then please, please, drive down to the
next exit or wherever and call the highway patrol or police, to let them
know the location and desciption of the stranded vehicle and that they
might need help. The officer can call for a wrecker or an ambulance or
whatever the driver needs.
	Last year a man's life was saved on the interstate just south of
Knoxville because one of the drivers from cedar bluff towing stopped to
check on him and his wife. He had just had a serious heart attack and
would have died without prompt emergency care which was called in by the
cbt dispatcher.
	It's a good idea to use discretion in helping people... if you're not
okay with stopping, please at least give them another way out of their
situation.

Thanks.
