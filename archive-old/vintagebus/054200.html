Subject: Air Vent on a 63 singlecab ??'s

I replaced the rubber gasket around the air vent on my singlecab, but I do 
not seem to be able to get it back together in a manner that makes sense.
The lever on the driver's side seems to have to be down for it to go into the 
shut position. Does the bar that goes across with the flat bits for the 
screws to hold onto have alternate positions?
Does anyone have any pictures of what it should look like with the cover 
taken off?
