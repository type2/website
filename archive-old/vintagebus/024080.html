&gt; Oh-boy I've really done it this time,
&gt; 
&gt; Yep, there's a heater tube, it's a standard. No biggie,
&gt; just change the sig line right? Wrong. It's going to be
&gt; a lot tougher to change the cool (and expensive)
&gt; &quot;62-KMBI&quot; license plate that I ordered. YIKES!
&gt; 
&gt; Oh, the newbi-ness of it all..

&gt; '62 Standard
&gt; 
Yeah, but really...
lots of folks call all buses Kombis. In mexcio they are all &quot;combis.&quot;
In  Just like every hippy I ever met told me &quot;wow, duuuude, nice micro&quot;
when they saw my kombi. 62-kmbi is still agreat plate, and only the
really anal of us will ever give you any greif about the small
inconsistency. :)
