(description of bad braking-accident closelyt avoided,)
after pulling over and calming down for a few minutes, i drove around a
parking lot testing my brakes.  there was a slight pull to the left but seemed
so-so.  i made it home (slowly!) and pulled everything apart,  could find no
visible problems, cleaned and re-assembled everything.  blead the rears -
noting unusual.  Blead the front right - nothing unusual.  Blead the front
left and felt more resistance than the first 3 wheels.  pushed harder and it
all of a sudden let go and seemed to bleed normal.  i checked and found no
'chunks' of anything swimming in the spent brake fluid.

i drove the pickup around a bit yesterday after checking things out, and drove
it all around today from west phoenix to scottsdale to tempe and it doesn't
pull a bit to either side now.

can anyone offer an explanation as to what happened and why it isn't happening
now?

rubber brake hoses

replace them    the front left sounds llike it is collapsing inside - which
will cause the symptoms you descibed.   Always do both on an axle.  Heck, do
them all, rarely do people notice them and replace them.   

And flush out the brake system, if you flush it out very year or two the
hydraulic brake components will last longer.

I found out about brake hoses when one burst on me (!!!!!) causing an
immediate and  severe lack of braking ability.  good thing my hand brake was
in order.  I knew there was something wrong with the brakes, but I didn't know
that it had rubber hoses.
