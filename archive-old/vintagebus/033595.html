Subject: RE: [VB] Holy dirt batbus

    I heard about and used the 3M rust inhibitor about 3 years ago, $18
dollars a can was steep I thought. It was designed to be used in body shops
that did a lot of colision repair and needed to protect inner areas from
corrosion after replacement (thus the long tube). 3M also makes a weldable
rustihibitor primer. This is great for primming the inner parts of rockers
etc. before welding in.

Hi Ronnie,
We wash out all those areas and every time it is amazing how much crud comes

out and often blocks the drain holes.  We have heard about 3M products that 
spray with a wand into these areas to seal the metal from rusting.  Has 
anyone tried these products and/or knows of a website on them?  Up till now 
we have used roofing tar thinned down in these areas.    Eric&amp;Barb
