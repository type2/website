Subject: Re: [VB] pulley leak

Hi Eric &amp; Barb

I think the real key is the part that says air can enter the
crankcase. The crankcase is sort of a pulsing between vacuum and
overpressure as the pistons move up and down. If air is sucked in
through a valve cover leak on a vacuum pulse, there is more air in the
crankcase on a pressure pulse, and by the gas law more gas is more
pressure, forcing oil out anywhere it can get out.

&gt; According to Workshop Bulletin of 15 August 1969:

&gt;   If oil is lost via the crankcase breather, first check the cylinder  head
&gt; cover gasket for proper position.  If a gasket is dislocated, as shown  in
the
&gt; illustration, air can enter the crankcase.  This forces oil into the  air
&gt; cleaner or through the condensate drain tube.
