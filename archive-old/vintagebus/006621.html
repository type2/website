   Over a year ago I had a fire here, in cleaning up the mess, with a lot of
help things got missplaced, well today I was sorting through some stuff and
found one of my missing boxes with a bunch of NOS parts in them, really made
my day, now to clean up the mess I made trying to get the shop clean for BBB
V  ronnie's shop tours.
