Subject: Re: [VB] Small nut gear set in a big nut RGB?

I am trying to figure this out too. I think the answer may be in '63-'67 
Bentley section H-4 page 7. I'd like to hear what others take this to mean, 
by my reading says: from maybe mid 1963 to the end of 1963, 1200cc busses 
had late suspension with early 1.39:1 ratio reduction gears.
&quot;Big-nut&quot; shaft is 35mm
&quot;Small-nut shaft is 30mm
(These are the little short shafts that the drums mount to, I think the 
shaft between trans and RGB stayed the same diameter.)

&gt;
&gt;Can a small nut gear set be installed into a big nut RGB?  Is the actual
&gt;output shaft a smaller ID or is it just the nut is smaller?
