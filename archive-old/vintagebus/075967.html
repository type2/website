&lt;&lt; When in the middle of the search for a nice shift rod boot, I asked the
 parts guy to tell me the cost of a '211xxxxxx'.  He turned to his
 computer and tried to figure how to enter the number.  What is that? Was
 his replied.
  &gt;&gt;

hm, the local dealer here was okay with the 9 digit part numbers.  I bought 
new rear axle bushings (for under the spring plates) from the dealer.   Their 
info went back to bay windows, but if I had a number they were fine with 
putting it it the computer

did you get your shift rod boot?.
