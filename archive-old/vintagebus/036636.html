Subject: Front Ball Joint conversion...leading to disc brakes

Earlier I had posted a question about the ball joint conversion.

Basically, it was agreed that the conversion from to a '68-'69 front beam
would rais the front of the bus 3&quot; or so.

I posed the question as to whether or not the modified Ball joint torsion
arms (to fit a splitty beam) would do the same?


No one replied with this information. Leading me to believe no one has
tried.


SO, I just got off the phone with Bus-Boys and got the information that I
needed.

According to them (I forget who I spoke to) -

	-There is no height difference

	-The cost is $295

	-This conversion only fits late '65 - '67 beams

	-Probably NO core charge

	-Not stocked... made on a order basis.

This sounds like a conversion I might wish to try with the ultimate end of
haveing front disc brakes.
In terms of all the other options of getting Front Disc Brakes, this seems
like the least trouble and in relation to other options, the least expesive.

They say at Bus Boys that they don't get many request for these.
Also, As I recall, Jim Thompson of Sherwood/Old Volks Home, had this
conversion and loved it.

Here is some pertinent info if **you** are interested.  Part# 21041001 Ball
Joint Converstion Torsion Arm Set
Bus Boys info number is (530) 244 1616.  Also....

I plan to get a set later this summer, when I have time to deal with it.

Hope this helps some people....
