Subject: 16 to 21 year old brake hoses replaced
Message-ID: &lt;19990517201345.11961.rocketmail_at_web114.yahoomail_dot_com&gt;

All the recent talk of rubber brake hoses finally convinced
me that I should install the four new hoses I've had
sitting in my &quot;Install all this stuff on my Bus&quot; box.  So I
did the deed, no problems other than one stubborn brake
line connection.  Tip - The can of Liquid Wrench says
&quot;Shake before use&quot; in big red letters for a reason.

I noticed my new brake lines were dated September, 1998 so
naturally, I took a look at the lines I pulled off the Bus.
 Only the rears were dated, one was 1978 and one was 1983.
The 1978 one looked brand new, the 1983 one had a few tiny
cracks.  Yeah, they break down on the inside, but I've got
to assume these were sitting on a shelf somewhere for a
while before installation...

Brake action is unchanged but I've got piece of mind.

Well, back to my box,
