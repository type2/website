&lt;&lt; after a little further inquiry...it appears that the gauges that i have 
seen
 rated as 6 volt, are mechanical gauges-where voltage is basically
 irrelvant(well the bulb in the gauge might need to be altered).
 Does anyone have any experience installing these mechanical gauges? It seems
 like a lot more work than a electric gauge...I guess eric and barb are right 
i
 may be better off installing an inverter, or search at some vw shows for a
 used 6 volt gauge like claral...
 
 
 I spoke with AutoMeter- the salesman there thought they used to manufacture 6
 volt gauges, but do so no longer.

did you try a VDO catalog- they have loads of guages and what not with all 
sorts of faces on.   And a lot of vintage car restorers buy them- not just 
for VWs, so there may well be 6V guages.   

BTW, I just happened on the 6V oil temp guage with VW 3/55- style face with 
dipstick sender dated c.1956,  both marked 6V, and the price was right.  It 
sat around for a few years before I installed it.  Then I found it worked.    
    Wouldn't mind trading it for one with a face to match my BD's speedo (ha 
ha)  anyway, you never know what you will find at shows if you dig around.
