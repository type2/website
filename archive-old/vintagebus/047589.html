&lt;&lt; Actually, you do. Because the stock heater blows air into the cabin for
 heat, obviously it needs some way to get out. If you crack a window open it
 will allow the heated air into the cabin easier and allow for more volume.
 This assumes that a million leaks aren't already providing plenty of space
 for the air to get out of course. You aren't wasting heat by opening a
 window, you are helping it.

I know people have said this before, but I disagree.   THe interesting thing 
is how opening vent wings directs the air flow.   it only gets cooler above a 
certain level.  which is good to wake you up is you are sleepy.  also it suck 
all the cigarette smoke out of the bus. but I feel generally warmer with them 
closed.   anyway,

I sent and earlier post, and forgot to say hey if your windows are rattling 
around in the frames you may want to just redo the whole top door assembly 
with new weatherstrips.     really cuts down on drafts.
