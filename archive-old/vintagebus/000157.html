 My bus has had ambulance step, but I dont have 530 on my m-tag, why?
  &gt;&gt;

these things happen.

my 65 westy is a westy, but has no westy codes in the m tag.  Yes, type 23 
painted inside in  the back and all, with tent things on roof and bumper.   

also it does not have the codes for safari windsheilds.  Which it came with.  
little bracket with threaded holes in the body above the glass in the window 
area, etc.
would be very difficult to do that later
