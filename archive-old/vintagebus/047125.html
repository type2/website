&lt;&lt; Please help me to understand this. While recovering a '67 bus for parts, I 
had occasion to get under it to tie it down. I looked up and saw a single 
circuit master cylinder. 
 
 The M-code plate reads like this:
 
 247014979
...........
 So what's up with this? It looks original and I doubt anyone would regress 
to a single circuit master cylinder.
  &gt;&gt;

this is an early 67.  early 67s came with SC master cylinders.
