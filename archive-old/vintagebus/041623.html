&gt; I'm coming in late to this thread, but I'll offer Harbor Freight as a source. 
&gt; A couple of decades ago I bought a Harbor Freight 3/4&quot; drive METRIC socket set
&gt; for $39.95.  Came with a ratchet, t-bar and 6&quot;extension.  I've used it
&gt; occasionally for, as I said, two decades.  Haven't bent the t-bar with a 6'
&gt; cheater. Haven't broken a socket.  Might want to check them out. They're still
&gt; around the same price.

44.99
such a deal. incl all the good VW sizes.
