&gt; , so i put on my new continental spare belt and the correct &quot;D&quot; stamped 
&gt; pulley and my ratio is now at 1.8:1.  my question is, what else could i do 
&gt; to get the 2:1 
&gt; ratio that im supposed to have? 

Hi Joshua,
That is what we found recently and posted to the list.  The only way to get 
higher ratio that we know is to install a 356 Porsche generator pulley and 
shorter than 905mm belt.
