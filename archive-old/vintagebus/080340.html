I would go with a minimum of 127.5 main and 55 air. I run a 132 main and
60 air on the carb that was on my old 1776 prior to switching to the
Holly 5200 progressive.

Bernoulli Interval: Do I really have enough data to draw a valid
conclusion ?

The main jet I removed when having major problems was 125 (but may be
the one I drilled out...unsure)

The main jet I replaced it with is 115 I think...there is a scratch
obscuring the number.

The air correction jet that was in the carb is 60

The pilot jet that was in the carb is 60g (whatever that means)

Available to me now, from other carbs, are main jet sizes 127.5, and 120
   air correction jets 125, and 75
