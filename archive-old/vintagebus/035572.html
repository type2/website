&quot;I am wondering if there is a good website around that has information on a 
switch from VW power to Porsche in a splittie?&quot;

I am probably more certain of my plan to put a 911 T 2.4l motor in my 
splittie. I am nearing the purchase of the engine and trans. So I am at least 
as interested in more information, pics, technical stuff etc
