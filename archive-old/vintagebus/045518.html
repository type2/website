&lt;&lt;  I've learned on hills to let the clutch out just to the point the
 engine bogs down and then switch from brake to gas and take off.  It's a
 no-roll start.  &gt;&gt;
Hi Volks,
As long as this is done in an instant it is not a bad thing.  We have known 
others who haved used this slipping of the clutch all the time while waiting 
at lights on hills which causes the clutch to wear out very quickly here in 
hilly Western Washington State.   Eric&amp;Barb
