&lt;&lt; Heading out tomorrow from my home in SoCal to points north.  General plan
 is to spend the 4th at my Dad's house in N. Nevada, then to head toward
 Glacier Park.  We'll probably be on the road for three weeks or so.  Lots
 of room for leeway in this plan!
 
 So, if you live in N. Cal, Nevada, Oregon, Washington, Idaho, Montana,
 or thereabouts and would like to have the Lyle's drop by for a visit send
 me a pmail and we'll see what works out.  We had a great time seeing a few
 listees last year and would like to do the same again this year.
 
 We're generally doing the same thing this year as last, but in a new
 (to us) region.  For some reason the Pacific Northwest hasn't seen out
 wheels for some time!  We'll put in a few miles each day and generally let
 our noses guide us.  The girls (2nd and 4th grade) are learning how to
 read maps and navigate,
 so this should provide some interesting side trips!
 
 If you see the white-over-green '71 with the antenna farm on the luggage
 rack, give a wave!

If you are heading near Olympia WA, come and visit.  It's not a very exciting 
town though, I tell you, but that's kinda nice.  My phone number is 360 866
