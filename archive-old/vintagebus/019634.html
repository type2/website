You need 3 things to run an engine - air, spark, and gas.  The trick is
to get the right amounts of each at the right time.

The fuses should have nothing to do with the bus.
 
Do you have an idiot guide?  If so, you can follow the procedures in
there.   Think of it in terms of getting the juice to the gas.  The
juice comes thru the ignition thru the switch, to the coil, out the coil 
to the condesor, across the points, thru the plug wires to the plug, which
spark and *bank* - there you have it.  Follow that path and make sure
each of the pieces is working correctly.  You didn't mention the condensor,
for one...  Take one of the plug wires off and set it close to something metal,
like the engine tin, whilst your buddy cranks the engine.  Are you getting
a bright blue spark?

&gt; Ooookay, well, I go to start up my bus last night... It sounds normal, but
&gt; does not want to fire.  I was just riding around in it 5 hours prior, so
&gt; this one is a puzzle.  I noticed that the needle on my tach doesn't even
&gt; shimmer like it usually does. I checked the fuses. Fuses are good. I checked
&gt; to see if my new set of points were opening. Points are good. I replaced the
&gt; coil with a new one. Still no dice. I checked again to see if there were any
&gt; loose wires or any sort.  The battery is nice and strong and I have plenty
&gt; of gas. Any suggestions? My poor bus :-\ TIA
