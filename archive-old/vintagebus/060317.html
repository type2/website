Subject: Re: [VB] what tow hitch works?

Anybody know of one that would work on a '67 Deluxe without any
modifications, I'd like to be able to tow my bug to shows.  Thanks.

&gt; I am looking for a tow hitch that works on a 60 doublecab.  How do these
&gt; mount to the bus and where are these available?  I want the best possible,
&gt; but it needs to be readily available.  I cannot hunt for 7 years for some
&gt; rare german NOS part at swap meets.  I need to get this ordered ASAP.
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; Jay
