I had the pleasure of taking two days off to go to the VW show hosted by the
Peach State Transporters and SEVWC in Marietta this weekend.  I took a few 
bad pictures, not as many as I would have liked as I left my laptop at home
so I couldn't offload 'em and keep taking more.

This was a historic show for me, as it is the first VW show the Westy made it
to.  It is also the first trip to some VW event in which my vehicle didn't
break down at some point!  :-)  Hopefully this will be a continuing trend.

I got to sleep in the back of the Westy for the first time too, that was 
really swell in comparison to lying on the cargo floor or across somebody's
front seat.  It rained a lot so it was a challenge keeping things dry, but it
was comfortable.  

The bus behaved well overall.  The fuel gauge magically started functioning
(I _like_ that!) on the way home today, and I don't seem to be leaking any
motor oil.  I picked up a nice straight crank pulley at the show that I will
be replacing my bent one with tommorrow.  Hopefully that'll stop the 
guitar-string effect I'm getting now.  The freeze plugs will also be replaced
in the RGBs.  Dave Easterwood and I will be working on the stuff after I get
out of class and he's off work.

Finally, if you want a larger version of any of the pics drop me a line and I'd
be happy to email you one.
