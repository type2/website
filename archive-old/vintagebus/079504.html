Hi Ric,
First you should have someone work the shifter while you slide under the bus 
and check for loose connections or the flexable shift coupler in the rear is 
nearing falling apart.  Also make sure all the bolts in this shift linkage are 
tight and safety wired in such a way as it keeps the bolts tight.  If still no 
luck you need to loosen the base of the shifter and move it left or right to 
get first and second gear working.
