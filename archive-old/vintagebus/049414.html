 &gt; I don't think the Binz that was for sale came out of
 &gt; Texas, but I could be wrong. The show was up in bus count from last year,
 &gt; there was 56 on hand for the days festivities. Included in the count were the
 &gt; two Binz crewcabs Dan spoke of, three highroofs, one being RHD, and the other
 &gt; two being US delivery, and a double door standard that could really use that
 &gt; infamous seat on ebay. Its is funny how buses seem to show up one year and
 &gt; then not the next, like, over the years there has been three different BD's
 &gt; there, and none this year. There were lots of &quot;new&quot; buses out this year
 &gt; including a 56 single cab with BRM's, Mark's 55 Standard,  Matt's slammed 57
 &gt; standard, and a 57 Kombi that was a transplant from NM. Oh yeah, Greg, your
 &gt; old single cab was there and looking great. It was great seeing all the old
 &gt; friends again, including the Georgia fellas ( Dave, Allan, Ted, and yes
 &gt; George) the guys from VA (Skip, Don, And long lost Lew) and Carlos from AL.
 &gt; And I couldn't forget my 'OL Bloke from South Carolina, Craig Allen.

 &gt; &lt;&lt; It cost $2 to get in if you were driving a split.  The two bucks covered
 &gt; everything - show &amp; swap.  If you weren't in a split it cost $15 to swap but
 &gt; you couldn't park near the busses.  8-)  It wasn't a huge show like OCTO but
 &gt; it was good sized for a bus only show, maybe around 40 busses but I didn't
 &gt; really count.  There were about 10 each of crew cabs and single cabs, trucks
 &gt; everywhere!  There was also another Binz that showed up.  It was the one
 &gt; that
 &gt; came out of Texas a year or so ago.  We parked next to each other so we
 &gt; could
 &gt; compare.  Very cool to be able to touch two Binz (Binzes, Binzi?) at the
 &gt; same
 &gt; time.  It is the first time I have ever seen two together.  (It is for sale
 &gt; if anyone is interested in a Binz.  Email me)  It was a pretty casual
 &gt; gathering where the shiny busses and the primered busses were parked side by
 &gt; side.  There were some really fantastic busses there including a great
 &gt; single
 &gt; cab which was recently finished but was still driven a couple hundred miles
 &gt; to the show...in fact everything was driven.  Great show.  I really
 &gt; preferred
 &gt; it over the Bug Jam the next day. &gt;&gt;
 &gt; 
 &gt; dan ,anthony camacho, was the guy in the blue binz from texas, i belive he is still in korea, he startted a two year tour right after the classic this year,it could have been a freind in his crew cab , hard to say.   paul
