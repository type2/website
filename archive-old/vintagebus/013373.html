&gt; Happy Canada Day listees!(july 1st - Canada's birthday)
&gt; Can anyone help me? I was at the classic in Irvine last month and
saw a 
&gt; booth  for a company in California that does a beaut job of restoring 
&gt; steering wheels, and for a decent price too. I had picked up their
card but 
&gt; now that I'm back home I can't find it. If you can get me some info
on that 
&gt; company or any other that does a good job of steering wheels, that
would be 
&gt; appreciated.

That would be Koch's VW in Canyon Country, CA.  Bob Koch's shop is
about a mile from my house!  He does a beautiful job on steering
wheels of all makes and models.

His phone number is 661-252-9264
Web page http://www.kochs_dot_com/
address is 26943 Reuther, Unit M, Canyon Country, CA 91351
