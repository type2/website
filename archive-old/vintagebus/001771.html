Thanks for the outpouring of support everyone.  I don't feel near as bad
now.  I know that no bus I'll ever own will be a show stopper.  Show
stoppers aren't driven and when it comes to VWs I own, they are driven and
used.  The daily driver routine does take it's toll though on the old dubs.

One thing that kind of bothers me is that when I tried to pull that popout
window on the cargo door, the seal came loose so I just pulled it out and it
took a big hunk of the petrified vinyl interior out with it.  There is no
way to hide the glue mess that is left behind other than glue on new vinyl.
The door panel looked like crap so I took it off and it revealed paint
peeled surface rust around the bottom of the cargo door - down under where
the support member is.  This bus by far is in much better shape than the 66
but because of this, it's almost like I've shot myself in the foot.  At
least the 66 I didn't have to care too much about it rusting any further
because I don't see that there is that much left behind to rust away! :-)

I've got a book around here someplace about body work that I should start
reading.  Right now if I was to go outside and tackle some rust spots with
my guess and by golly intuition, I would tear into the surface rusted areas
with a 3m abrasive pad and grind the rust away and then paint the area with
some of that POR15 with filler in it.  Then before it dried completely, I'd
shoot several layers of gray primer, let it dry, and then dry sand the edges
down.  Maybe I need to read the book though - I really know nothing about
it.

Anyway, I think what made me have a sudden change of heart for the worse
about the bus is that after realizing all the money, time, and hard work I
spent/put into this bus, I'm still not even close to halfway done and it
really does look like a POS inside and out.

So for now, I think this is what I'll do:

Replace that worn out steering box
Pull out the middle seat and floor mat and treat all the surface/deep cancer
areas with POR15 and let it cure.
Fix that popout window in the cargo door with one from the 66 and replace
that seal, leaving the torn vinyl spot exposed
Throw the floormats back down
Bolt in the middle seat
Bolt in the back seat
Put the VW logo on the back hatch
Oil and screen change on the engine
New tranny fluid (since I put 500 miles on the new tranny, I want to flush
out any wear particles)
Adjust the headlights since they are way off
Install a good stereo
Figure out how to put some plywood down inside in order to have a makeshift
bed for trips

And then just drive it this summer to a few shows, assuming it doesn't take
all summer to do the aforementioned list. :-)
