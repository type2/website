Yup.  The air-cooled crowd is notoriously &quot;thrifty&quot; save for
a few notable exceptions.

Most of us air cooled people buy are goodies at swap meets and junkyards.

Unless they were to get advertising revenue from the junkards, there's
not much point in marketing to the AC crowd.  THe only advertising
possibilties would seem to be from the chrome-fan-shoud type of places,
and they're a dying breed.

Face it; the only parts most of us buy new are resto bits, like
repro rubber.  Now that the CalLook craze has died, with only a few
holdouts here and there who were too young (and romanticise about the
Disco Era because they didn't suffer thru it) and missed it all back in 
1985 (or who refuse to believe the world has moved on), the market for
&quot;engine dress up kits&quot; and clear distributor caps has dried up.  My
local VW FLAPS can't give the stuff away.

In step the A2/A3 chassis vendors, with rice boy exhausts, body fiberglass
kits, engine hop-up kits, yada yada yada who have marketing and 
advertising budgets to get their stuff in front of the kids in the
new beeters.

It's just good business.

Now, for a type-only mag to survive, it has to have income.  Printing
all those cool glossy centefolds of NOS ribbed (for his pleasure!) 
bumpers costs money.  That money has to come from advertisers or
subscribers.  

I think the only chance of a decent type 2 oriented publication would
be something like the NEATO newsletter.  And guess what?  It already exists!
If membership was larger, the resulting fundage could support a larger,
cooler newsletter.  Maybe even color pix like the one Ty Hodges
does (Cascade kombi's?).  And the classifieds are to die for!

Yeah, VolksWorld is cool, but it's too hard to get over here, and
it's still tooo full of kustom kars with carerra cup wheels and
wizard bodies.
