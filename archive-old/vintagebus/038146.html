Hi Zachary,
Ok.  Where are you located!  After all shipping it all the way from Outer 
Siberia to USA would be too expensive for most volks even when free.  So 
knowing your location on the planet might perk up more takers if they know 
they are in your neck of the woods.  Next what engine number does it have?   
Thanks, Eric&amp;Barb
