Subject: Re: [VB] Jerome as scheduled

&lt;&lt;Religious zealots are the problem today;&gt;&gt;

Boy, you hit the nail on the head there. And you can witness the rise of
relogious fanatisicm here in this country too. They come in every
religious denomination and have more to do with jumping up and down and
releasing brain endorphins in emotionally synchronous ra-fests than with
true belief in God.. Their mantra is to &quot;don't think. . . surrender and
let God guide you.&quot; They don't bomb buildings but make no mistake about
it. . . they are dangerous too. Take guard against these types.

Hopefully, listees are more level headed.

Saying a prayer for the victims and families.
