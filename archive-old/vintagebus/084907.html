  dipstick oil temp sensor

&gt; We need some good pics of your engine.

Two to start with

&gt; I am having trouble with the idea that your oil gets  hot, but your
 heads don't appear to be getting hot.

Many on the list believe that oil and head temp are not that correlated.

&gt; ....you are correct about checking
 the oil cooler for obstructions...especially if I remember that this
engine sat up for quite awhile...  mouse nests?

No this engine did not sit. I visually inspected oil cooler a month
ago when the engine was out. It was clean outside. Dunno how it looks
inside.

&gt; If I remember correctly, you already said that all engine sealing rubber
 was replaced.....???
Yes, (pic 2).

&gt; Check fan belt tension...generally more of a problem than folks
 realize....make it tight!  Cooling fan clean? and clear of leaves/rags and
 other debris?

It is tight. No debris in the fan (except one of my fingers)

&gt; Disconnect paper air hoses(for a test) and cover the fan shroud air holes
 very well...VWFLAPS sell plugs for this for a few bucks...or use several
 layers of duct tape....just for a test.

Tried that already. Does not solve. Wife likes heat at 2am after partying.

&gt; You should easily be able to do at least 65 on flat roads all day long.
I wish.

 &gt; Brakes dragging?(more load on engine).
Nope. New brake lines, caliper changed as required, rear drums not
dragging. Heads would get hot if they were under load. Heads are cold.

&gt; Yes, take the engine out and check for an oil cooler that has gunk all
over the outside(inside).
Will do.


&gt; Thermostat operational???? and correctly set up?....take it off
&gt; totally(make sure flaps are open totally) and  go for a drive...any better?

No thermostat. Flaps and return spring working.

&gt; Exhaust in good shape?...or leaking back towards engine compartment.
&gt; Use your hands to check for exhaust leaks after you start a cold engine

New stock exhaust. Engine almost dies when I block it.
