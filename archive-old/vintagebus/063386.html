&gt;And finally his signature file to reveal the beast to all:
&gt;
&gt;VW  Bob
&gt;Bob's Auto Salvage Online &lt;--Also doing business as East Coast Motorworks.
&gt;http://www.vwbob_dot_com
            ^^
I wonder if VW's over-active trademark protection department knows
about him?  The enemy of my enemy is my friend...

Other interesting info...Bob is in Pennsylvania.  His domain is
registered to somebody in Texas:

His Web site is hosted on freehostingweb_dot_com under the username
&quot;vwbobco&quot;.  Freehostingweb says they give you mailboxes at your
domain; Bob could have his email _at_vwbob_dot_com but he doesn't.  His
Web page has a Webmaster address of baja1641_at_yahoo_dot_com and a general
contact address of vw_bob_at_webtv_dot_net .  His &quot;order form&quot; goes to
the WebTV address and to bobsonline2_at_hotmail_dot_com .

He has a '65 Bug race car for sale that he presumably built.
Interestingly enough, he didn't build the engine for it - says it
has a &quot;Kawell racing engine&quot;.  He also doesn't know how to spell
Pauter.

He _may_ have previously called his business &quot;Bob's Volksworld.&quot;  See
the picture http://www.freehostingweb_dot_com/~vwbobco/jypbobssinglecab.jpg .

Just some extra info.
