This is a small poem for those who can speak German!
Say it out load
I hope you have fun and a MERRY CHRISTMAS


Dot Lettle Fur Cap.

Der next night vas Christmas
Der night vas shtill
Der shtockinks ver hung
By der chimney to fill

Nodding vas shturring
At all in the house
Fer fear dot St Nichlas
Vas nix kom hereus

Der shildren ver dried
Und gone to der bed
Und mudder in her nightgown
Und I on ahead

Vas searchink around
In her trunk for der toys
Ve krept around kviet
To not make der noise

Now Mudder vas carrying
Der toys in her gown
Showing her person&gt;
From her vaist down.

Ven as ve kum near
Der crib uf our poy
Our youngest und sveetest
Our pride und our choy

His eyes open vider
As he peeked from his cot
Und seen everytink
Dot his Mudder has got.

But he didn't take notice
Der toys in her lap
He chust ased,
&quot;for who Iss dot lettle fur cap?&quot;

Und Mudder said &quot;hush&quot;
Und she laffed mit delight
&quot;I tink i give dot
To your Poppa tonight!&quot;
