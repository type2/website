Well,

While all the big spenders were over on the other side of the pond
dropping wads of greenback son cool trinkets, they weren't around to
jack up the prices of things on e-bay.  I won 6 auctions that I placed
all under $20.00.  NOS door handle $5.50!   Hey every one.....stay in
Germany.  Woo Hooooooo!
