Subject: Vintage Meet Trip Report

Friday afternoon Bruce and I packed up the swap stuff into the white 67 
Riviera and headed off for Seattle.   Had spent Thursday installing the new roof 
lining in that bus.  WIth the bubble wrap shiny insulation and the wood in, it 
was much cooler in there than with the whole back unlined.    Been driving that 
bus the past 2 weeks and I figured it was ready for a trip out of town.  I 
had only put abouy 300 miles on it, so it is still somewhat of an unknown 
quantity.  Sat since about 95.   It also has all the camper kit out, so there is 
lots of space to haul stuff.

Decided not to take the barndoor, it takes so long at 50 mph and it seems 
real hot these days to take such a long drive.  I wimped out.

Ended up getting stuck in traffic for so damn long the average speed must 
have been 30 mph, including the fast bits. (hah on me) Stop and go traffic  for 
miles and miles.  accidents, etc happened.   Eventually got to the 
burgermaster,  think it took almost twice as long as usual.     Bus started popping out of 
1st gear and sometimes 3rd, once 4th.   jeez   I hope it's the shift coupler 
and I don't mess the tranny up driving on it.

Burgermaster was a parking lot filling up with many ACVWs, spilled over into 
teh safeway lot next door  lots of bugs and buses.  Of course I was scoping 
out the buses.   Driving this Riviera I spotted a bus that was a really nice 
66(?) Riviera.  green/white with deluxe trim on the outside exceot the rear 
hatch, real clean original Rivie inside.   Should have taken more pictures.  Cant 
remember the guys name, but he also collects 8 tracks and he has Black Sabbath 
Paranoid so I hope to get hooked up.   This is a great meet, lots of neat VWs

 We wandered around and gabbed and drank malts for a while (2 or 3 hours),  I 
asked if anyone brought a shift coupler with them. then went to go hang 
signs, to direct people from the freeway to the show.    Got done with that just at 
it got dark (10ish)  and found a diner for dinner.   We stayed the night at 
Zachs. and got up at crack of dawn to go to the show for early set up.    Ended 
up in a swap space next to Ken (with Wayne of the prize winning 56 kombi) who 
was next to Bob Herr.   against the trees to have shade all morning.

Wandered around the swaps some, but didn't get much other than a $5 15&quot; bus 
rim (not dated 56)(there were more for $40 a pop) some fuel line, and a few 
widgets.  No one seemed to have a shift coupler (mine had wiggle, the old 
sandwich kind with cracks in the center of the burger).  Eventually I noticed the guy 
right across had them, I traded a cute little barndoor toy for it that I got 
at a non VW swap meet.   Crawled under the rivie to swap it, but I couldn't 
get the old one out.  I had my 8mm square headed socket with me and a short 
extension on the medium ratchet, cool. Undoing the two screws for the old coupler 
was fine, but the shift rod didn't go enough forward to actually get the old 
coupler out.  icky 67 style shifting.   removing the shift stick in the cab 
didn't help.   I tried to take apart the front linkage, but broke the screw  :(.  
 Well, guess hm I was stymied, and the gravel felt really comfy under the 
bus, especially when it worked it's way into my jeans, ow.  So screw it.   I'll 
do it at home, and grind the collar apart, I think I have a spare.

So kicked it for a while longer, the afternoon sun was hot, left the show 
after the prizes (beer steins for 1st, pint glasses for 2nd were being award.  
Why no shot glasses for 3rd?  awards that will get used instead of collecting 
dust).  Took down the signs. the post meet Cascade Kombis club barbeque was, as 
always, excellent.   The drive home shorter.   The riviera got 17.5mpg, not 
too bad considering the ton of stuff in it and the traffic, and hanging signs it 
sat and idled at every stop.   Puleld hills loaded really well, blew my mind. 
  Oil stayed clean ofter this first freeway run. (put about 200 miles on it). 
 I kept it at 55.  Dipstick wasn't comfy to hold for too long, but engine 
didn't sizzle spit.  nice.  still keeping an eye on the mystery motor that sat 
for years.    dern shift coupler.

Transfered the stuff from the rivi to the westy when we got home.   I set the 
alarm for 5 but didn't wake up till 6.   We got out the door and ended up at 
the raceway about 7:30, surprised to find the line of swappers still waiting.  
It started real soon (perfect timing, I appreciated the extra sleep).   I 
bought a header muffler for the rivi, as the one on it points up, preventing a 
bumper from fitting.    Ya, stock mufflers are better, but this was $3.   This 
day I brought a baseball cap,  good against the sun, and hung out in the Herr's 
shade next door and shared my Aloe Vera with them.  Neat radio station 
sending bus with huge antenna on top in the show section, bay but still cool.   

 packed up about 1.30 and cruised through the swap on the way out.   Then 
through the parking lot , which was in the shade on dirt under trees.   Bruce 
said hey, that looks like Susan's bus (blue/white dormobile, visible in Wayne's 
Burger Meet pics).   And there was Susan and Chris with his green westy not 
starting.   the point were white from ambient moisture when the motor sat for 5 
years in her garage, so I filed them shiny.  The fan belt was really loose, and 
there was stuff around that area.  Seemed that the rust on the pulley was 
sanding off the belt,  it was new the day before, when he had replaced it.   so 
Chris sanded the gen pulley smooth, and as much of teh crank pulley as he could 
get.   Now it started up, but sounded bad.  Like something metal in there 
wanted to emerge.   no excess crankend play, oil still clean, not quite sounding 
like a rod going.  From both sides, not the middle.  I suspected really off 
(loose) valves.  were the rocker arms coming loose?   Hey Susan did it get home 
okay?

Westy ran 87-90C (about 190F) oil temps on the way home in about 90F weather. 
 Got home about  6 or 7.  Nice weekend.  Might go to Portland next weekend 
for the Bug drags/swap there
