Subject: Report from Switzerland - I miss my Bus

Switzerland is where I got my first jones for vw buses. The wheels had been set in motion when my uncle and
his two friends arrived in London with all their saved up money in 1968. The next day they went to the Stones
Benefit in Hyde Park. My uncle met a school teacher who had spent a few years in Europe and was heading
back home to British Columbia. He was selling his European transportation, a 1960 bus. They bought it for a song,
One of the guys wrote his dad in Rhode Island, had him run down to the registry and get plates for the bus. His
dad sent the plates to them in London, they stuck them on, stuck their goodies under the gravel guard and proceeded
to drive all over europe and had no trouble using the RI plates except in Morocco where they had to wait at the border
for a few days. So a few years later, they bought a 63 panel van from a French Winery- it has grapes and vines painted
all over it, they took it under a bridge and brush painted it blue. When I visited them in Switzerland in 1973 I was 5
years
old and remember driving around in the back of it, going down to France to the supermarket, or up the mountain to ski.
Later they brought it back to RI on a freighter and one of the guys kept driving it. In 1981 I went up to his house in
Harmony, RI and discovered the bus was gone. He said the clutch went and they no longer wanted to deal with it and
junked it. It was a sad moment as I was 13 by then and looking to get it in a couple of years.
