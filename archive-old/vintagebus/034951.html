motorcycle list.
 Sounds quite comparable to questions we have about our VW's. XS11's are 1100
 CC Yamaha inline 4 motorcycles, air-cooled.

  No There is not a temperature sensor on the XS11 but you can add one.
 
 I have operated all types of air cooled aircraft engines from 100 to 650 
cubic inch displacement. The technology of these aircraft engines is exactly 
the same as air cooled motorcycle engines, the
 &gt; materials are the same and they are both cooled only by movement through 
the air stream. The smaller aircraft engines normally only have an oil temp 
gauge. I just checked several aircraft manuals and the red line on the oil 
temp is usually 245 degrees F but some are as low as 225 F. I never really 
worried about the oil temp except as an indirect measure of the engine 
cylinder temp itself. The oil carries heat away from the cylinders and 
radiates it from the oil pan and from an oil cooler if you have one. In this 
way the oil acts to cool the cylinders and the oil temp is an indirect 
measurement of the cylinder head temp. I have always figured that the 
critical temp is that of the cylinder head itself and that it makes more 
sense to measure that temp directly with a Cylinder Head Temperature gauge 
rather than indirectly with an oil temp gauge. The larger aircraft engines 
usually have cylinder head temp gauges in addition to the oil temp gauges. 
The red line on the CHT fell in the range of 460F to 500F in the manuals that 
I just checked. The red line on the oil temp gauges on the large engines is 
the same as in the smaller engines, 245F.
 
 I added a CHT to my bike for about $60. Took about 20 minutes. I  just 
unscrewed one of the spark plugs, removed that spark plug gasket and replaced 
it with the thermocouple (sending unit) and reinstalled the spark plug. Then 
I attached the the gauge to my handlebars with two cable ties and attached 
the wires. No connection is required to the bike's electrical system.
  Works good and the temp is pretty stable at 350F. The highest I have seen
 is 400F and that was crossing the Mojave desert when the air temp was 120F. 
I figure that 475F is a reasonable red line in this operation so I haven't 
come close yet. It provides peace of mind.
 
 On a former bike I had the pistons seized from overheating on two separate
  occasions and I had to do major surgery on the engine to fix the resulting 
damages. Each time cost a lot more that $60.
 
 It just so happens that the 14mm CHT thermocouple (sending unit) fits 
perfectly around the crankcase drain plug and replaces the washer. So I 
installed a second thermocouple there and use it as an oil temperature gauge.

 I wired in a two pole two throw lever switch  in the thermocouple leads so I 
only need one temp. gauge on the handle bars and I can measure both cylinder 
head temp and oil temp just by flipping that switch.

 I ordered the parts from Gulf Coast Avionics, 800-474-9714 with a credit
 card and they arrived in three days. Order the 2 inch Cylinder Head 
temperature gauge and the 14 mm probe which are on page 30 of their catalog.
