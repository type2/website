I'm sad to say that after doing some additional research it looks like
I'd be happier on the type2 list rather than the vintagebus list, so If
you have any info on a VW Bus of any year, and think it would make it
on a lengthy road trip, and think I can afford it, you have my email,
and I'll be on the other list.
Goodbye!
