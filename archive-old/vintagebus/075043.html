Subject: Pedal pan covers (under pedal cover plate)

   Type2parts_dot_com is pleased to announce a new product we are making. We all
know how hard it is to find the under pedal cover pans for our buses (1955
to 1967) so we have decided to reproduce them out of fiberglass.
   I have just approved the prototype part and after a few improvements they
will be ready for sale. These look exactly as originals and now you don't
have to worry about them rusting.
   If you are coming to OCTO I will have it displayed and if you are only
coming to the Classic look for my Aussie container van in the freak show and
I will also have it displayed their.
  I will post pics on The Samba later and vintagebus_dot_com today. Projected
cost on these will be $75.00 dollars each.
