&lt;&lt; WAITAMINUTE - I get it now! This whole thing has been concocted by Erin as
 another way to stroke his ego!!! We all have to yell &quot;pretty please don't
 make us sad Erin&quot; just like Caesar and the Roman Senate.... well, NQ, we're
 ON to you boy!. &gt;&gt;

Anybody thinking along this route is waaaaaay off base.  I have known Erin 
for several years now and have had him stay at my house several times.  There 
isn't an over-ego'd ounce in his body.  He is the kind of guy who says 
&quot;Thanks&quot; 10 times for everything, makes the bed when he gets up, does the 
dishes for you, and would do anything to help you out at anytime.  

I think the main problem is that the (VW) world is so full of shysters that 
when someone genuine comes along you/we have difficulty believing it.  You 
can believe it when Erin says he is posting to help other people out.  You 
can believe it when Erin posts that he drove 150+ one way miles to help me 
get my Binz ready for my move.  You can believe it when Erin says he met some 
list members at BBB and really liked them.  And, you can believe it when 
myself and the list members from BBB post that they really liked Erin.
