With all the Puck talk, I had to go dig out the Nov. '98 issue of HotVW's
and take another look at Jim &amp; Paula's SO-42/Puck combo. All I can say
is...sweeeeet!!! I can't wait to get my bus in that kind of shape.

One question: why is the electrical inlet on the driver's side? Mine's on
the left rear above the tail light. Is this because of the back-up lights,
which I don't have?
