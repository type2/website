If you took the best features of a late bus, you'll find them on this 66
Westy.
Larger 1600 cc modified engine.
Independent Rear Suspension (Reduction boxes removed), 210-51012A  IRS I
Conversion with Adjustable Spring Plates, March 1955 to 1967  $585.20 
Heavy duty transmission.
Rear Sway Bar.
Ball joint front suspension.
VIN: 236017302
This is a 66 Westfalia Camper with walk through front seating.
After driving this Westy about 700 miles on both city and highway
conditions I'd say that this Westy is one that you can buy and drive for
five years with just normal maintenance.
The engine is highly modified to a 1700 cc, dual port head, dual carb
with a hot cam but it starts easily and runs strong in all gears.
This little Westy is a screamer, it just hunkers down and goes like
crazy.
It has no difficulty running 70 mph on the highway and still has power
for passing.
The vehicle weight is 2600 pounds and performs better than my 83 Air
Cooled with a 2000cc Type IV engine.
I installed all new ignition with wires, blue ignition coil, points,
condenser, rotor and cap. 
I adjusted the valves.
I installed new CV Boots and packed the CV joints.
Change the oil and filter (6 quarts with add on 1.5 quart pan, FL1-A big
Ford Filter, Oil cooler)
Changed Grease in Transmission.
Installed new front wheel cylinder kits and brake shoes.
The engine does not drip any oil and the exhaust / heater system appears
to be in very good condition.
There are several thousand dollars worth of upgrade modifications to the
engine and drive on this vehicle, it is a good working combination as
evidenced by the performance.
Engine modifications:
Dual Solex 34 Carburetors
Dual Port Heads
Oil Cooler
Large Remote oil filter (Ford FL1A)
Vents added to valve covers and collector added for crankcase
ventilation.
Oil Pressure Gauge
Oil Temp Gauge
1.5 quart add on oil pan with 110 volt oil heater
Type2 Tranny and Drive Axles
Engine Hour Meter
K&amp;N Air Cleaners
Ceramic Fuel Filter
New Battery. 
S&amp;S Header System.
The electrical system has been updated to 12v with an alternator upgrade.
Heavy Quality rear trailer hitch bumper.
The rust in all locations has been treated and removed and then retreated
prior to priming or painting. If you have any interest in this 66
Splittie, it is located in Dallas Texas and it is a driver.
The van was completely striped of the interior and all interior surfaces
have fresh paint.
All interior trim and kick panels have been replaced. 
All void areas have been packed with foam block insulation.
Both front doors have all new rubber seals and scrapers.
The original front seats have been replaced with late model Vanagon
seats.
The original 1966 Westfalia Camper equipment is intact.
The rear passenger floorboard has been replaced and covered with vinyl
floor covering. 
The floor area below the plywood has been treated for rust and properly
rust proofed.
It has been brought to my attention that this bus has a late bay 75-79
Dash in it. After a thorough examination I find that a late model clip
has been installed starting at the seam behind the bumper and up to just
below the windshield. This accounts for the wipers not being in the
center of the windshield position and the later model dash. This slipped
past me since I'm not a Type I aficionado. I don't see that this detracts
from the bus unless you are wanting to win best of show at VW events.
If there is anything else that you want to see a picture of .............
please advise me. I'll add the picture here or mail it to you.

I have tried to make a full disclosure about this bus.
Here is the Bus Story as I have been told by the PO.
A Husband and Wife bought the Westy from the PO that had it for about ten
years. They took on the restoration and had the bus in their garage and
out to local shops for repairs and restoration. During the ten years that
they owned the bus they traveled in it and pulled a small trailer similar
to those used by motorcycle riders.
They lost interest in the bus and it migrated from the garage to the
carport and then to Rick's VW for completion where it sat outside for
about a year.
They clearly spent lots of money on the engine, drive train and the
extras such as oil cooler, remote filter, supplemental oil pan.
The bus became available as the result of a divorce and I bought it from
the wife over protest from the X husband.
I've bought and restored about six Westies (mostly 80-83 Air Cooled) in
the last eight years. This is the first one that I've ever bought and
could drive home. After liberally saturating the cylinders with Marvel
Mystery oil and changing the fuel one day I returned the next day to
start the van.
After installing a new battery, changing the oil and filter (added a
Quart of Marvel Mystery Oil into the new oil and 8 oz to the fuel) a
spark coil wire and giving it a jolt of starting fluid it started and
ran.
With minor carb tuning, setting the points and general inspection I ran
the engine for about an hour before driving it home approximately six
miles. 
From that point it was just a matter if simple things to the engine:
New Plugs, Points, Condenser, Rotor, Spark Plug Wire Set, Distributor
Cap, Setting the Timing, Lubricating the Distributor, New Alternator
Belt, New Battery Cable and rebuilding the Carburetors.

The quality of the oil cooler / remote filter installation, the vent
tubes on the valve covers and some of the other add on items leads me to
believe that much of this work was done by an individual that had access
to a very large shop and had aviation mechanical experience.

Yes! I painted the dents.
I'd rather have painted dents than bondo. The buyer knows exactly what is
there and can deal with the simple body work chores and minor painting
required.
I can't envision this van as ever being a show stopper but it has a lot
of fun and utility left in it that can be enjoyed with minimal repairs
and maintenance requirements.
