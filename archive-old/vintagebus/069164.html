I used the same stuff...off of some american car..mini-van or something. 
Found the same stuff on the trunk of another car. So it's on plenty...just 
look around.

I think it's important to get it BEFORE you install the safari's. I did 
mine after and the seal was bigger than the original. Made the fit kinda 
not so good. But still worked tons better than the original stuff. Don't 
know why they don't use this kind of seal. Just plain makes sense.

Of course if you've got the original safari &quot;plates&quot; installed you can move 
your windows around for a good fit. But most guys won't have that.
