Here's a photo of the tent I need/want.
This is the ideal color but any pre-59 tent will do. Don't need poles but 
will take them if available.

big bucks plus finders fee $$$$ + trades, show me what you got!

I spent about 2 hours in the cold garage picking at the westfalia yesterday.
Debating whether to repair the mechanicals and get it running/driving to make 
BBBV,
or to strip it down to nothing and fix the rust, and do the paint.

Well, I started ripping it apart and labeling everything.
Time to get started I suppose.
Its not going to be quite as nice as Robert Davis' 59, as i'm taking a 
different approach.
Heres the current parts wanted/needed list:
