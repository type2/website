Subject: Re: [VB] CE Aluminum Safari's  first impression

Hi Ronnie,

Is CE still using the rectangle |_| shape frame or have they gone to the more v
shaped outer edge like the OG ones?

Thanks,
Aaron

&gt;     I just recieved a set of C E aluminum Safaris for a customer (he ordered
&gt; direct) and I must say WOW. The frames are absolutly awesome. They are
&gt; extremely rigid, no flex and are DOUBLE WALLED like OG ones. The only thing
&gt; I don't like are the hindges are SCREWED on instead of welded so you have
&gt; screw heads showing and he hasn' t changed the hindge holes yet so they
&gt; won't bolt up to OG plates.  Overall impression on a scale of 1 to 10 I
&gt; would give them a 8/9.
