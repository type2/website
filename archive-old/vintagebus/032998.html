&lt;&lt; Eric &amp; Barb, I'm in Spokane right now, and I need to get to Bangor, near 
 Seattle.  I've driven ~500 miles already with this leak, and lost .5 qts. of 
 fluid.  I figured the bearings were shot.  I've got over 1000 lbs. loaded 
 into my poor bus.  Any suggestions on what I should do?  As of now, I have 
 to leave Spokane by Tuesday or Wednesday to have time to buy a house and 
 report to my sub by Monday.  Thanks and Happy driving--Chet &gt;&gt;
Hi Chet,
Yes!  Get a reduction box axle seal kit, a page of telephone book to make a 
gasket to go between the reduction box halfs, a gallon of tranny oil, and a 
set of four bearings for the reduction box.  Drain tranny, and both reduction 
boxes taking time to see what size and amount of shavings (Shavings bigger 
than a pin head and much more than just a few are the sign of bad bearing/s.) 
are coming out of the tranny and each box.  Once you have the drum off of the 
leaking box check the stub axle for play.  If you get lots of shavings, 
and/or play in the axle, it is time to dissassemble and replace the bearings 
and seal.  If not loose or shavings then you might get by with just replacing 
the lower rear axle seal.   Eric&amp;Barb
