&gt; 1961 saw a new needle color, I believe at the front of
&gt; the model year.  Check out the middle issues of 1995
&gt; HVW's for the &quot;definative&quot; answer though.

HVW's and definitive answer....thats an oxymoron!

 (around
&gt; May/June of that year.)  They did a once a month
&gt; series on the bus from sometime in '94 through
&gt; sometime in '97.
&gt; 

Lots of mistakes too.  Doesn't anybody check facts anymore?
