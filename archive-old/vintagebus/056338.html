Subject: RE: [VB] Carbs again....116?

Mikuni's are the same MAINS, they look slightly diff, but screw in,
sizing similar. I have them, but only 120,100,90,lower. I would like an
elusive 116 jet, if anyone has one.

I'm running a 125 with that exact set up (similar to 100 cam I think)
and mine (brand new 30/31 stock 40 hp air cleaner) is running really
rich.  I'm going to try around 117 and see what that does.  Once warmed
up it does run really nice...no hint of a stumble.

What size Mikuni carbs do you ask for.  Are the mains the same?????


Steve




&gt; 112.5 main
&gt;
&gt; Bigger!  Bigger!  Bigger!  Especially with that cam.  Heck I thought
&gt; that carb came stock with a 117.5..?
&gt;
&gt; Try a 130.
&gt;
&gt; Go to a bike shop and get a Mikuni(?) jet for $2.
