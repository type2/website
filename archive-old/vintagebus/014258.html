Subject: [VB] '54 Still for sale...
Message-ID: &lt;19991210223317.5616.qmail_at_web1204.mail.yahoo_dot_com&gt;

Back on the list after a change of ISP and hard drive
crash...

Just to remind you all that the '54 ambulance camper
is still for sale. It truly is a nice bus.

Se habla &quot;OBO&quot;
&quot;Make offer&quot; means just that...
 
Original asking price was based on recent (1999)
market movement and the July,1998 appraisal by Dan
Lawson of Competition Engineering, Tempe, Arizona.

Happy Channukah and Merry Christmas to all!
