&lt;&lt; I've often wondered if it would be possible to utilize the external
 electrical outlet on westys to run a BN4 or similar heater.  &gt;&gt;
Hi Mike,
In such a situation you can easily plug the bus into the 110 AC voltage.  
Then plug in a battery charger into the 110 AC inside plug and plug the 
outlet wires of the charger to a cigarette plug inside. 
In a bus without the 110 outlet plug one could easily just put a battery 
charge in the engine compartment with an extension cord to it and charge the 
battery that way.
  Either way it would be wise to put a note on the steering wheel or a couple 
of bottles of oil in the drivers seat to remind yourself to disconnect your 
bus from the extension cord!   Eric&amp;Barb
