&gt; &gt;Check the turn signal switch.
&gt;
&gt; Before I layed the bus up I was having problems with turnsig switch not
&gt; staying in the left position.  I have now lubed it with dielectric grease,
&gt; and the switch itself is shiny and the springs look like new.
&gt; Is there something inside the switch that could be causeing this? Because it
&gt; still looks like new on outside of switch.
&gt;
&gt; Do not us antiseize for wiring you should use dielectric grease.
&gt;
&gt; I was careful with the anti-seize I used a toothpick to insert the stuff in
&gt; each terminal because it is a conductor.

Which one are you saying is the conductor,
the terminal or the anti-seize?
I don't think the silver colored anti-seize is a conductor and
don't use it on spark plugs for that reason If I did;
I'd track down another anti-size. There is a
copper / graphite anti-seze, Champion part # 2612
I have been to lazy to find a source for it, though.

Aloha,

Ken Alford
