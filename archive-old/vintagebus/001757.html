In the past 2 days, I've taken a great step forwards in this bus project.

Yesterday evening I was able to install the brake pedal and weld up the
fatigue crack in the stop.  I also braced it up with an additional tab but
my welding skills not only sucked, they sucked even worse when I welded
upside down.  Now I kind of have a stop tab with a ball of gumball welds on
the backside.  Oh well - it's all POR15'd now and the belly pan will hide my
amatuerish welding job.

I had to buy a welding bottle earlier in the day and nobody had the little
bottle in stock that I wanted except the welding supply store that had
ripped me off last year and really left a bad taste in my mouth.  The story
was that I turned in my bottle last summer and 6 months later, I was still
getting bills and threats of collections so I had to call the head office
long distance in Salina, KS to iron out my problems.  This was the 3rd in a
series of incidents and last summer was the last straw.  When I spoke with
Gene (the new manager of the store for 6 weeks) initially over the phone, I
related my story to him.  He apologized and told me stop by in the afternoon
and he'd have a bottle fixed up for me.  I visited with him and he told me
of how when he took over, he found checks 3 months old that hadn't been
cashed amongst other paperwork that was allowed to accumulate.  Gene has
really had to pick up the pieces left by the last numskull.  He apologized
for the gross oversight despite it not being his fault - he backed up his
words with a discount on the bottle and giving me free gas.  I told him that
was enough to convince me to do business with them again - I left on good
terms sealed with handshake.

I placed my first order with Bus Boys last week and my order showed up
today.  I ordered the $10 tool that aligns your torsion springs and rented
the swing lever bushing tools.  I gotta say that the tools are AWESOME and
the directions for using them SUCK!  It's just a bunch of photocopied
stuff - some pages look like blueprints and others are hand drawn diagrams.
The written instructions aren't too bad but they are written for a tool
which is slightly different than the one they sent me.  I would venture to
say or at least suggest, that Bus Boys should allow someone free rental of
these tools as long as they take full color photos documenting the procedure
along with writing step by step directions.  At any rate, I figured it out
finally and installed my bushings, reamed them out, and installed the swing
lever - wow - that is nice!

I'm so tired now I can post anymore - I'll finish this update in the morning
if I can get up!

More later...
