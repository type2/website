Subject: Re: [VB] five buses

70 daily driver in the yard, parked in front of the 67 deluxe project
(please buy it!) parked next to the 73 ghia i'm wrenching for a friend, in
back of the 50 chevy half-ton, which is next to the 67 beetle lewis is
assembling, which is next to the 65 singlecab... yesterday lewis's 70 was
also in the drive. oh yeah, and a bassboat, a pile of trannies and enough
doors fenders and hoods to build 20 bugs.

next door is is 68 beetle and a 70 poptop, both motorless. plus about 7
other cars, truck and trailers and other junk the guy drags home alla time.
he won't sell, give or trade me the poptop, so i get to watch it rot :P

across the street are 3 plymouth furies from the early 60s... i LOVE living
next to the scrapyards - NOONE is gonna complain about US :)
