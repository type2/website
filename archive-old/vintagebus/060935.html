Subject: Re: [VB] Bus sights in a movie!

Does anybody remeber an old thriller/mystery movie (in color) where an
austrian/swiss/german type guy is driving an american (like claude
rains-ish sort) back and forth all over the snowy hilly ski-ish sort
of area in a
red/white deluxe? Seels like maybe a quarter of the movie is involved with
the bus. I cant fo the life of me remember what it was.
