All they are are modified Brazilian bay window bus dog legs
they fit a bay window (Brazil) perfect (almost)
The rear corners use OEM brazil and you have to take the bumper hump out,
there are cheaper Brazil parts out there, just make sure you get the ones
with the VW parts tag on it, just like the cargo floors, there are OEM ones
and then the cheap Brazil repo's.


just my 5 cents worth
