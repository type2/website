Subject: RE: [VB] New items and interest

&gt;On another note, I am wondering what the interest would be on complete
pre bent brake line kits made out of stainless steel.
&gt;
Possible stupid question, how do you install pre-bent brake lines when the
brake lines go through the frame in some places?

It sure looks like a bunch of my brakes lines would need to be bent in place
during the install process.
