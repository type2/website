&gt; I have not been able to determine, by the parts list, what size those
&gt; [walkthrough seat] pivot screws are.

You may have figured this out already, but:

If the part number looks like 211 222 333, possibly with a letter after,
then it's a VW-specific part.  This doesn't mean you can't make something
up that will work, but you probably won't be able to buy it off the
shelf at your friendly local hardware store.

If it looks like N 11 222, that's a VW &quot;Normteile&quot; or standard parts
number.  Quite often the description of these will also give the specs,
like M6 x 30 mm, but if not, there is a list with full descriptions in
Main Group 0 of the parts manual under &quot;Standard parts&quot;.  You can get
most of these off the shelf at your local hardware store.

You may have done this already, but it may be helpful to buy one bolt
each of all the combinations of thread pitch and diameter from about
M4 to M12, each one around 30 mm long or so.  Then spray-paint the whole
set bright orange or some other hideous color, and keep the set in a
little bag as your gauge set.  When you're faced with a threaded hole of
unknown origin, try your orange bolts until you find the right one, then
take it to the hardware store (or your bolt bucket) to get one to
actually install.
