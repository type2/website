Subject: Looking for a split again.

hello everyone, this last year I found myself doing the unimagineable and
selling off my 70 fatchick and a load of related parts. A deep emptyness
needs to be filled once more, as I realize I can't get myself out of the bus
seat. My heart has always been in the splitties, and now I seek to have one
again. The search begins for a nice original girl, somewhere out there I
will find her....

I miss the old crowd and the chats and the shows and campouts, even though I
am on the much deprived east coast. Hope all the names I once spoke to are
well and safe.

Please feel free to contact me for any reasons, as well as for any busses
you know of that might not be on the samba in the 57-67 range,

Regards to all,
AL once known as incynr8
