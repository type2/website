You will need to rig up some kind of a press to get those frames back
into position where you can put the screws back in.  A couple of 2x4 or
1x4 sections of lumber and a couple 2-3 foot bar clamps usually work. 
Push everything back together as much as you can, then apply the wood
and clamps to each side.  Gradually tighten them (do not force) until
the screw holes line up, and there you are.

&gt; I seem to have two different kind of pop-out glass to frame seals. I had
&gt; some lying around I think i got at a swap meet. these fit perfectly. But
the
&gt; ones I ordered recently seem way too small. i can't get the frame all the
&gt; way on because they are too small. Am i doing something wrong or is this
not
&gt; the correct seal for what i need? another words, do they make two
different
&gt; kinds of these seals?
