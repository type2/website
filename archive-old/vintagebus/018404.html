re: prefiltering gasoline
I use the cheap disposable paper filters that are sold
at paint stores and some hardware stores or home
centers for straining paint.  They are a paper cone
with a fine cloth (?) mesh at the point and fit a
large funnel that in turn fits in the gas filler
opening on the vehicle.  I use this when using
gasoline from one of my gas cans that is a bit rusty
inside, and if I drain gasoline out of anything, I
filter it before storing it or using it.
If you wanted even better filtering, a milk filter
disc and funnel would do a good job, and could be
found cheap at a farm auction in a dairy farming area.
