Subject: Re: [VB] To buy or not to buy: '59 Double-door panel
  walk-through

&gt; BTW I am not worried about the rust replacement, I know i can do that if i 
&gt; take my time, and of course the mechanical, I am not worried about, but I 
&gt; would also want to put a bed in the back, and not sure if this would be 
&gt; the bus for me, especially if I would devalue the bus at all if I was to 
&gt; put camper interior in it......opinions?
&gt;
Since it's both a double door and a walk-thru and you are not worried about 
the rust, I'd say go for it.

That combination is not rare but it is less common.

Making a Panel into a camper would not devalue it unless you start hacking
stuff up.
