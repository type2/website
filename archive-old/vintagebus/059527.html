Subject: Re: [VB] Friday question

I'm scooby fan. But it seems like they might have blew it with the 
movie. Won't know until my kids decide they want the video.

The only good thing is if they DID  blow it, then maybe they also did 
use the wrong vehicle and stuck a VW bus in there as the mystery 
machine. Scooby should have really had one originally anyway. Oh 
well, most folks remember it as a VW bus anyway.

We could alway talk about Sheryl Crowes new music video. Who's bus is 
that in there? Wouldn't mind having Sheryl  rub around my bus with 
her guitar.

Old VW busses are REALLY &quot;in style&quot; right now.

&gt;Any of you SoCal, Hollywood insider type bus folks have the scoop as 
&gt;to if the &quot;Mystery Machine&quot; in the new Scooby Doo movie is a VW or 
&gt;not?  You can only see a partial shot of the cargo door in the 
&gt;commercial.  Looks like it might be.  I'll have to take my boys to 
&gt;go see iteither way but if there is a VW in it at least I would have 
&gt;something to look forward too.
