 Yeh, that doesn't really help though. I've got a mango bus sitting in my 
 barn right now. But like that picture on the URL you sent, it sometimes 
 looks brown, or tan, or yellowish, instead of a green color. I don't know 
 why. Maybe my eyes are bad.
 
 So it's a green....right?

oh- you want a word not a picture.,  As they call is Mango Green, lets call 
it a green.   A brownish yellowy tan sort of green
