Subject: heads dumping gas
Message-Id: &lt;199903071546.KAA24113_at_home.hrfn_dot_net&gt;

I have a friend with a 63 23 window he hasn't driven since he had it (6
years). anyway, we put the new motor in it yesterday and it's DUMPING gas
out of the #4 exaust pipe studs, or somewhere around them. The nuts are
tight and it has a gasket, but every time you turn it over gas comes out.
We checked for fire going to the wire and it was there, (and it has an
electric fuel pump if that matters). even if the plug is bad and it wasn't
firing, it shouldn't dump gas out right? He took it to a well known shop
here (Va Beach) that said they ran it, but we don't think they could have
with all this happening. Anybody got any ideas for us. Right now we're
really getting frustrated.
