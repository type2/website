&gt; Many unenlightened people believe that the pedal

&gt; Up is &quot;off&quot;, Down is &quot;on&quot; and anything in-between is
&gt; boring.  When switched
&gt; on, you have achieved WOT (a.k.a. wide open
&gt; throttle) and are ready to
&gt; venture forth into the world, Grasshopper.  (Any who
&gt; don't believe me
&gt; haven't ridden with me!!!)

And this from a man who owns a bus that that at WOT
can run at MACH 1.2...... (a.k.a. The Gensler Zone)

Hey... we got witnesses....
