&gt;Your views on wanting a '55 book are no doubt shared by many
&gt;bus owners,  NEATO and vintagebus list members alike.
&gt;(especially those with barndoors )

The 1955 manual does not cover barndoors.  It covers March
1955-58, but the only change between them &amp; up to May 1959
is the bumpers.  The 1952/53 manual covers barndoors &amp; I
realize that is a much more limited market and not economically
feasible to reprint.

&gt;I &quot;need&quot; a pre 1963 Bentley (though as you said,-
&gt; &gt; There is VERY LITTLE info

I am a little confused...  You &quot;need&quot; a pre-63 Bentley?  You have
a 1961 which is mechanically identical to a 1963:  Same 40hp
engine, same front end, same early syncromesh tunnel-case
transmission, same reduction boxes, same brakes...  the only
differences between a 1961 and a 1963 are cosmetic:  bullet
turnsignals, glass taillights, front seats and engine compartment
louvers.

&gt;You think a pre 55 is best; others a CDROM w/ .pdf files
&gt;What it all comes down to is that Bentley holds all the cards;
&gt;and it would be best if a united front is presented to them.
&gt;I hope that a open forum such as the list would lead to agreement
&gt;and publication rather than fictionalizing.
&gt;What would you like to see different in a post to the VB list
&gt;  or a OBR opinion piece / petition

I would prefer that priority be given to getting a reprint made of the
1955 edition of the VW Transporter Workshop Manual.  The 1955
covers the 36hp engine, the non-syncro 1st split-case transmission
etc.  that would not be covered in the May 1959-62 edition.  My
version of the May 1959 Workshop manual covers the &quot;bastard 40hp&quot;
which would be useless to 99% of the people out there, although I
believe there were 2 versions of the 1959 manual, with the earlier
version covering the 36hp.

In short, I believe the 1955 edition covers more uncovered information
and would be more useful to more people than a May 1959 edition,
and Bentley would sell more 1955 edition reprints than 1959 reprints.

As I said, I have a 1955 VW Transporter Workshop Manual I am
willing to loan to Robert Bentley and Neil Pickett made a similar offer.

I agree we need to be unified in our efforts, but I also think we need to
be realistic as to what would be easier to market.

In terms of which edition to reprint, I hope I made my point clear...  ;)

In terms of what format, even though a cd is cheaper to produce, you
have to take into account economy of scale...  Bentley will never sell
as many cds as they will printed manuals.  Look at the prices on the
Bentley website &amp; you will see the cds are more expensive than the
printed versions.  Why, if the cd is cheaper to produce?  Because
they don't sell as many cds.

I think we should ask for a printed version.

These are my opinions, but I realize I am not the Alpha &amp; Omega of
the Vintage Bus Kingdom.  I will support whatever the consensus of
this list and NEATO members feel is most appropriate.
