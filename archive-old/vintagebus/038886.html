Below is a copy of a letter I received from Robb Reed President of the Rose City
Volksters they along with the Eugene club are the promoters and organizers of
the Woodburn Oregon Show and Drag Races. Seems they are looking for &quot;show cars&quot;
for the Portland Roadster Show. If you are interested in having your bus part of
a display give him a call or email him back

his email is semaphore_at_ifreedom_dot_com and phone number are listed below

As many of you know the show season is coming, in fact our first show is less
than a month away!

The Portland Rodaster show in the Oregon Convention center on March 3,4,5. We
will be doing a club display and we need your help.
We need 4 cars to participate as a club. The application process is lengthy and
there is no guarantee that any of us will even be excepted. Their judging
criteria is specific and unknown to applicants. I have heard stories of cars
that were not excepted that should have been and there is always 1 or 2 in the
show that are real eye soars.
So here is where you come in. If we have more than 4 cars our chances of
entering are greater. Justin and I have filled out applications and we are sure
that Greg will be entering too. He has a triple axle Rabbit pickup that might be
ready for the show. We also have Mark Kunt with his dragster that is in primer
and should see a coat of paint this weekend. A few other members have shown
interest but we are not sure if they will materialize. Do you or a friend of
yours have a Portland Roadster Show worthy VW that could be entered with us? 
The show set up date is March 1, 9am-11pm. The entry fee is $30.00, but it will
be refunded at the door (so it's free). Our theme is the Bone Yard (junk yard)
where we will have old and dirty VW parts spread around like a scrap yard.
Behind all this rubble of broken trannies, tires, heads, and leftover seats will
be the diamonds in the rough. We should have some fun with this. 
If you or someone you know is interested we have some important information for
you. The deadline for applications is the 9th of February. We need to turn the
applications in TOGETHER and here is the criteria.
 You must first obtain an application, I have a few and so does Justin, we will
have them available at the club meeting on the 8th. If you want to wait and fill
it out at the meeting, and hand it to us at that time, here is what you need to
do between now and then! Write a check to The Portland Roadster Show for $30.00.
Gather two pictures of your car. One 3/4 shot of the front and one 3/4 shot of
the rear. Bring these things to the meeting.
If you want to get a jump on the application you can reach Justin at
503-981-0678 or Robb at 503-620-6508. We will do what we can to get you one in
the next couple of days. I cannot stress the importance of the February 9th
deadline enough. We cannot be late on this or we WILL miss out. If you are
having difficulty making this deadline, call me! Otherwise get started and we
will see you Tuesday.
Robb
Ps, some of this information will be duplicated in the upcoming newsletter, but
I wanted to give you just a little more information!
