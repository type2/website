Subject: update tent cleaning

After taking the list numerous different opinions on tent cleaning, I used a
little of each, this is what I learned so far

1. Woolite mildew and mold spray cans does get rid of the smell, but does
not clean the spots away.

2. Woolite, that you add to the wash, cleans fairly well but doesn't
completely get rid of the odor.

3. The tents must have some kind of water proofing on them that comes off in
the wash, or there was a residue left from washing on gentle cycle with cold
water and Woolite. I will hose them off today and see.

4. Hanging the tent panels in the Arizona sun dry them out in less then a
half hour.

5. I only tried cleaning 1 side panel and the changing room divider
(thank-you Mr. Ellis for that info), so I still have the top and 1 side
panel to do.

6. On these I am going to try the simple green method, but only a little
spot at first to see what happens.

7. I will keep the LIST informed on my progress.

8. Look for my DD at the shows with double Tents now, 1 on each side.Looks
like a circus.
