&gt;  &gt; List,
&gt;  &gt;
&gt;  &gt; There is a little red light between speedometer and fuel gauge on some 
&gt; split
&gt;  &gt; buses what is it for ? , my 67 single cab doesnt have it , I have one and
&gt;  &gt; want to install that but where should I hook it up ? . I am improving the
&gt;  &gt; dash I have installed an original clock and an old vdo tach , thats why I
&gt;  &gt; want that little red light ..
&gt;  &gt;

It is for the 65 and earlier style emergency lights-  the red light flashes 
when the hazards are on, on 66/67 buses the actual hazard knob flashes.
