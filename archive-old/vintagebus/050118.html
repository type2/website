&gt;         That's one of the things I don't understand about the archives --
&gt;why is there any delay at all in archiving???  My only experience with
&gt;running a list is with majordomo, but with that, it's automatic. Why isn't
&gt;it here?

The archive lives on an entirely different system (Stephen Gutknecht's
vw.i405_dot_com, which he maintains entirely at his own expense) and the
messages have to be moved into it manually, which is not done often because
it is a real chore.

We're looking at a MySQL/WebMerger system run out of the type2_dot_com box; we
have the horsepower now to run real database muscle where we didn't used
to. That one will have a message lag of no more than 23.9 hours and
blazingly fast search/retrieve. If the UNIX gods smile I may be able to
have it up this weekend. They never smile though.
