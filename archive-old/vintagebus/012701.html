hey all,
don't know if anyone will care but i also have an interest in Land
Rover vehicles, and in my travels through the net i found a sweet
page with Land Rover Dormobiles. lots of pictures, check this out:
http://wheel.dcn.davis_dot_ca_dot_us/~jfhess/startpoint.html
considering Land Rovers and the Dormobile factory are from England, i
wonder who decided to take a bus and install this into it?
later,Bob Margiotti
Cleveland, Ohio
'66 Westy SO-44 &quot;Showboat Gertrude&quot;
