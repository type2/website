To all - 



Any help with the following questions would be greatly appreciated. This is

my first split - cut my teeth on bay windows. I have a '66 21-window that I

have begun to restore...



1. Does anyone make replacement nose skin?
- -- -  -
yes, but they are not as good as original
.  . . .  .

2. What's the going rate for one hacked off a wrecked bus?
-  - -- 
varis immensly- circa $100 I think
. . . . . .

3. How hard is it to put on - anyone done this before?
- - - - 
yes- just the skin, and also a nose graft.   To include the dash you graft the
frame on as well as the skin.  This requires much carefull fitting or the
windsheilds will not fit and the doors will hang a bit off.
I have recently seen a really cool tool to undo the cool pressed eges of the
nose skin (swage) it folds it up!!!!   so cool.
.  . .. . . . . . . . 

4. With the exception of the blinker lights - are nose skins the same from

60 - 67?
-  -- - - - - 
there are headlight bucket differences- it this that was about 62 model year,
the dash tray and the cut out on the pod were changed aprill 11 61, (the day
my 61 was made), the 71 dash has a larger radio hole, 62 was the first year
all buses had grab handles, the 63-65s with emergency lights have the hole for
the red warning light on the dash.   the gas gauge was standard as of 62.   SO
really you want a 62-66 dash w/0 emergency light holes if you want to
transplant the dash.
 ..  . .. . 

5. Is it easier to get a nose skin with a dash already attached?
- - -  -
probably, but you could take the skin off
 ..  . 

6. Are the dashes the same? - with the exception of the cutout for the

clock
- --  -- 
see above.
 .. . . . .  .. 



My nose skin  is good until you get down to area above the bumper. Here the

PO has tried to pull out a good size dent with a puller - drilled lots of

holes - didn't do a very good job. The area below the lip which has the

holes for bumper mounting has started to rust-out in places. I guess I was

wondering if it would be easier to replace the bottom half of the nose or

do the whole thing......I guess I'm just exploring my options...
  -- - - - - - 
it may be very hard to hide the weld seam.
 .  . . .     .

My dash has had lots of extras added to it, (lots of holes), and I would

like to return it to stock....One item I'm not sure about is the

rear-window defogger switch.... Was this a dealer add-on? It's mounted on

the left side of the steering column part of the dash (perpendicular to the

dash), and has 2 wires that run in the channel below the skylight windows

to the rear glass.

it was an option, but I think as of 67, but it is so unusual that I am not
sure.    It i was a stock installation it would have a little  (~1/4 in or
maybe a tad smaller) red light on the dash that lights up when they are on,
same as an Italian spec beetle brake warning light.  Think the stock switch
may be hidden, but not sure.
