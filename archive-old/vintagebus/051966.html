&lt;&lt; Is there any reason why I can't reweld a broken steering damper bracket 
while the torsions bars are in? &gt;&gt;

Hi Gary,
First if you do not remove the torsion leaf springs and wipe out the grease 
in there you could end up with a grease fire inside the tube!  Second you 
need to be aware if you heat the tube too much you possibly anneal (Soften) 
the steel of the torsion leaf springs in that area.  Best advise is if you 
really want to do that way is to have a fire extinguisher handy and only weld 
small areas at a time and let it cool down between the welds.  After welding 
regrease the torsion tube zerks fitting with lots of grease to rid the burnt 
grease out of there.
