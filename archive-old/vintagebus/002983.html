&gt; Brian, where are you stationed? I'm in the AF (saw your KC-135, as a
&gt; vehicle)(grin)
&gt; Jon
&gt;
&gt; Yea, I thought I would just throw that in since I work on those as much as
my 67 bus. I'm stationed at McConnell AFB,(jet mech) been here about four
months. I am getting used to these as I was a 141 die hard for 13 years. I
am still trying to convince my commander to make a TDY to Germany for a
parts hunting trip, I'm sure that I could really load up the cargo bay with
lots of vw parts.
