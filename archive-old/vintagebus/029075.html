One thing to think about is are you going to replace the sunroof with canvas
or the vinyl?  I couldn't find anyone with white canvas but there is a beige
canvas that looks really nice.  The vinyl comes in white.

Do you want the sunroof to blend in or stand out.

I replaced the sunroof in my '58 bug with the canvas which  really looked
great compared to the old vinyl.

Just my 2 cents worth.  Ginger
