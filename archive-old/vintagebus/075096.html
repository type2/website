Subject: RE: [VB] How do you buy a new/old Beetle from Mexico?

  Beetlemex and other companies are changing the pans and using those vins
to register them. When you buy a Beetlemex or one of the other companies VW
beetle they will be registered as the year  the pan used, usually 67 to 73
depending on the emission laws of your state and/or county.
  I have allready tried to get one of the last 3000 limited editions built
but my friends in Mexico have said they are allready all sold out. I am sure
we will see a couple here in this country in the next few months at some
West Coast VW show.
  Another way I have seen them brought in is by switching vin numbers and a
couple of them even registered as 2001 models by using some less then kosher
title companies. Just don't get pulled over by some federal DOT or EPA guy
with one of those.

The company is called &quot;BeetleMex&quot; and they import a new Mexican beetle with
an old american vin number

Scott

I think you can get them in (pretty difficult) but you can't register them.
It has something to do with emmisions or safety regulations I think. Some
guy is selling on for $11,000! That's a pretty expensive parts car!
