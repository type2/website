&gt;M 544 anyone?

Per your message from the other day, I think 544 is '009 without flat
spots'.

&gt;anyone have 535 (tach) ?

&lt;tangent&gt;
The German reference book I have (the same one that led me astray the
other day on 1500 vs. 1600 in a '67) calls M 535 &quot;Fahrtenschreiber&quot;,
which Babelfish says is &quot;Travel recorder&quot;.  I wonder if this is what
is sometimes called a &quot;tachograph&quot;...basically a speedometer with a
chart recorder.  I think in the EU, over-the-road trucks have these
installed, and they record the speed and time the truck was driven.
The one I've seen mentioned has paper cards that each new driver puts
in, but now they may be electronic.  The idea is a basic form of
&quot;flight recorder&quot; for accidents, verifying speed limit compliance,
and verifying hours-of-service compliance.  I think US truckers would
have a fit if such things were mandated, although many companies here
have similar capabilities with GPS tracking now.
&lt;/tangent&gt;

ObBus: I'm sure many Buses were delivered by OTR trucks... :)
