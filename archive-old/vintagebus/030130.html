How about rent-a-bus in the sin city or there may be good deals on cars

&gt; I've managed to find a round trip ticket from Omaha to Las Vegas, NV for
&gt; $168 and that is dirt cheap.  The price doubles if you want them to fly you
&gt; any closer to Havasu.  It's even more to go to Phoenix.
&gt;
&gt; So I guess all that is left is to ask if any one is coming down through Las
&gt; Vegas or would like to shuttle me to the event and back (I'd be in Vegas on
&gt; the 18th and have to head home that Monday afterwards 22nd).  If I get the
&gt; ticket, then it says I would arrive at the Vegas airport at Thursday night
&gt; at midnight.  Then I'd have to be at the airport like late Sunday night at
&gt; midnight.
