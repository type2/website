Hi all,

I've kept a close ear for any talk of the Vintage VW Spring Festival in
Carlsbad this sunday, but it seems that no one is bringing it up and its
NOT even a SOTO show. :-) Has this show been kept low key for a reason?
Or just overlooked.
I'm going to be there, and while I'm not a tall skinny guy in VW hat,
(No offense from the smaller population on the list) you can find me
roaming around with my  navy blue VW Hawaiian shirt on.

Well, I hope to see you there.
