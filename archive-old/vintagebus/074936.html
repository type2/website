Subject: RE: [VB] Re:Paintin' me bus

  Painting is a very tricky business and takes time and patients. Lou has
time and patience, as did Rex. Ricky Fu painted his westy and it looks
great. Lous bus looks like a pro shop did it. 
  There is a whole list you can go down of people on this list that have
painted their own buses and they are all beautiful but there are just as
many that have PAID to have it done.
  My DD was pretty till the paint went to crap. Thom F painted his yellow
DD, Lou painted his Westy, Gene C painted his, Ricky Fu also painted his
own, SV2's did there own club bus. John VW/Harley Howard has painted many a
buses himself, Dawn from PLF oainted her highroof herself and hasn't Clara
painted a bus or 2 and I am sure there are a lot more that have I didn't
name.
  Yes it's nice to say I DID THAT, but sometimes time doesn't allow it, so
off to a shop it goes. That doesn't mean you can't still take pride in your
bus. Owning and driving a bus has enough pride in it's own right.

ps. for a good look at home painting go/find the site of Gene Cornelias,
very good pics start to finish, including his home made paint booth

&gt;  you can say &quot;i did it myself&quot;, with pride!

I agree w/Lou. It really does give you an empowering feeling to learn 
to do things yourself.
