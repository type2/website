Subject: Re: [VB] Bar and Chain Oil

What is this thing people have against petroleum products?   

Oil is great, roofing tar is awesome, grease is good. What about vinyl and plastic?  Those dinosaurs died for us to be able to use petroleum products.  Don't make them sorry they died.   Drive more, use more gasoline.  Our civilsation is based on this stuff.  They're fighting for you in Iraq.  Support the troops!  Use more oil.

(oh, you mean POR-15 is a petroleum product?  okay, never mind)

(it's just that I love the smell of tar.  associations as a small child with La Brea Tar Pits in LA, which is a great place.  Take your kids there.  All kinds of critters wandered in and died and got preserved in the tar.  When they repave the road it wafts me back to a happy childhood.  Preserve your bus in petroleum products.)

(It's sort of Friday, isn't it?)

&gt; do you want POR in there or oil?
