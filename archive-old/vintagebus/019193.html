quick survey question...what condition is the wrap on your heater pipe?

mine appears to be in great shape...I don't want to take it off, because i am
sure i would never be able to get it on properly again.

why does this wrapper...towards teh back of teh bus only cover one of the
pipes from the heater box...it appears that way on my bus, and on parts
diagrams I have seen

any ideas..
