Stella is idling now...
I adjusted the valves via (not to start any opinion wars again) the
method where you adjust the forward 3 valves on the pass. side, and one
on the drivers side, then rotate the crank 360' and do the others.. you
know what I mean.  when they say adjust them stone cold...well ..they
were adjusted at about 0'F.  Is that cold enough? :)  She runs better
than ever now.
I had to jump her as I need a bigger battery for this cold weather....

just wanted to let you all know


later
Isaiah
