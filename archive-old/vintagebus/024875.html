I once had a bus guru here in St. Louis tell me his philosophy on
walk-thru vs. bench. He said if you had a bench seat and you wanted a
sandwich, your wife would kick you in the head when she crawled over the
back to make your sandwich. He also had a few colorful metaphors
describing why you need crank out windows on your bus instead of
pop-outs, but this is a family list and I'll save it for scary-story
campfire time. I could never tell the tale as well as he could, anyway.

	I have both a walk thru and a bench model, not by design, but just
coincidence. The bench is great for keeping our Lab off our laps, but he
prefers the walkthru, because he can put his chin on the dash and see
the road better.
