Subject: My new baby!

Hey everyone. Well I have a new addition and she arrived safely off the
boat tuesday morning. I'm talking about my new to me 53 Barndoor panel.
My partner and I had a beautiful morning coastal drive from Port Heuneme
(Oxnard) to Santa Monica and the 53 drove like she was brand new thanks
to Merrill Burton's cherry restoration. I was pleasantly surprised with
the way it handles and the ability to make it up a hill with pretty good
speed and power considering it's a 25 horse engine. For those of you who
don't know this is the 53 grey panel that is showcased in the &quot;Original
VW Bus&quot; book (same book Jerry Jess's 50 is in) and has also had feature
articles in numerous magazines since it was restored. 

I can't remember how many looks, stares, rubbernecks, or just plain
hurry up and get out of my way drivers I have seen since hopping in
yesterday morning. Well off to have a little fun cruising it around.
Check out the photos and drive your bus. Trailers are for when they're
apart not when they're together. http://hannoverwerks_dot_com/53drive   I'll
make a web page later but for now enjoy.

I will be bringing it to the first OCTO of the year for it's U.S. debut

By the way we have t-shirts for sale that are sure to be hot sellers.
The prints have either a sealing wax red / chestnut brown logo or an all
dove blue logo on white, blue or biege shirts. Or you can get a navy
blue shirt with a white outline logo. These will be 12 bucks for list
members otherwise they are $15. Get em for christmas. Shameless plug.
