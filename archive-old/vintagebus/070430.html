Subject: RE: [VB] Safari Windows

  Bus-Boys does not sell Safaris anymore that I am aware of. John Howard
just put Wolfgangs front and rear polished stainless steel (truck) Safaris
in his (now gone) V8 DC and they seemed to look good and fit well. Wolfgangs
front safaris alos have changed the latch to O G style wide base!
  C E's are almost exact copies of OG and they do offer them in polished
aluminum. Their frames are now double walled aluminum (same construction as
OG ones, except aluminum), these fit great and also look good.
  It is best to CALL C E to order, this way you know for sure that they got
your order and get a verbal delivery date.

Still haven't heard from anyone whether they have had any experience with 
Wolfgang or Bus Boys Safari's. I can't seem to get a reply to e-mails from 
Creative, and it doesn't appear that they offer polished frames.
