Subject: Last weekend, was loose heads

Hey y'all
Pulled the engine this weekend and retorqued the heads.  This is the 1st
in 468 miles for the right head (since left head was installed), and the
1st real, 2nd if you count just the nuts under the rocker for the left. 
The left head was, as I thought loose, in the 13 - 18 ft/lb range.  The
right side was in the 19 - 23 ft/lb range.  Not as bad as I thought it'd
be.  I loosened the nuts and most carefully retorqued whilst fervently
worshipping at the dog-eared altar of St Muir ;-)

There was no sign of the studs pulling out of the case savers, so that
wasn't the cause of the loosening syndrome.  It could be that everything
was getting reacquainted and some settling occurred in shipment.  I'm at
a loss for the cause, but the suggestions included:
	1.  Studs pulling out of case/case savers (Several)
	2.  Already overstressed studs caused by overheating (John Kyte)
	3.  Improper nut to stud fit (machinists fit class 2) (Eric &amp; Barb)
	4.  Overtorque the first time (a distinct possibility) (John Kyte)
And Bob Hoover who replied to my original post and this series as well,
discussing the probabilities of the above and offering much advice on
what to look for.

I'm betting on #4, as this was the first top end my wife had ever done
and I doublechecked her torques in typical Dave fashion - to spec and +
1/4 turn.  My own damn fault if that's the case.  This is closely
followed by #3, as the nuts spin freely on the studs.  

While I was in there, rerouted the oil lines to filter, made them longer
so I don't have to cut 1.25 inches each time I want to retorque.  Also
renewed a clamp that grenaded when I started to tighten it, and
doublechecked all the others.

Also removed drivers window, derusterized the area, filled &amp; painted,
and reinstalled the window.  My stereo shouldn't short out in the rain
any more!  Gotta have tunes ESPECIALLY when I can't see where I'm
going.  Jerry &amp; the band tend to have a soothing influence during those
stressful times.

And so at this point, I must thank all of you who offered very
insightful suggestions as to the cause of this phenomenon.  Thanks to
the support of all, and ESPECIALLY my better half who rolls her eyes
whenever I mention taking the weekend off to wrench!

Dave
