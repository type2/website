Subject: Change the stats 66 Westfalia in Arnold MD (WHOOHOO!)

Well it looks like I am a dual list member now.  I have been looking for a
decent split for awhile now that was affordable and drivable.  I was unable
to drive this van because it did not have a license plate.  It was some sort
of trade for money owed thing. The seller has a mint 63 21 window (I think
it was a 63) and I felt he was honest   It has a clean title and I plan on
registering it as historic (no inspection or emissions!).  I will post all
code info etc., when I have in my possesion.  It has a rebuilt engine that
sounded very good and I figured w/that and I believe a fairly complete
camper interior it was worth what I paid for it.
It is all white, will need driverside rocker work. Cargo floors looked
great, the whole underside exept in the front driversside looked good. Needs
hubcaps and new rubber for the windshield. Back right light is out.  All
glass intact and lights etc.  Has bed, cabinets, sink/cooler, hammock,
poptop which I haven't popped do to the exitement. The guy was confident I
can drive it home so hopefully after title change I will be able to get home
this weekend.  I will keep you all posted and am interested to find out all
the original color accessory information.  Looks like I will be learning
some body work!
