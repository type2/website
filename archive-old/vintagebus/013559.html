&gt;so, 800 spins per mile...at 3500 rpms and 4 to 5 miles per minute..50,000
&gt;miles to knock off .....10,000 minutes...divided by 60 gets you roughly
&gt;167 hours...then in days that'd be about 7....
&gt;No problem...secure the thing to your work bench...hook up the drill motor
&gt;and tape up the trigger and plug it in...
&gt;We'll all be sure to remind you next week at this same time to go back out
&gt;in the shop and turn it off.  :)
&gt;By the way...if you accidently go over 000000   it'll take a lot longer
&gt;than the 7 days to re-zero!


Not sure how this affects the equation but on all bay and Vanagon speedos 
[not sure on splits] the cable speed is underdriven (or is it overdriven??) 
by the speedo head. The ratio is marked on the back of every one.  W = 0.82
