Hi Andy,
Did you check the end play?  Hopefully when you removed the old seal you did 
not scratch the bore it seals into.  Also when instaling FW seal it is a good 
idea to run your finger around the bore in the case to make sure it is 
smooth.  If not then lightly sand with fine wet/dry paper to make sure any 
corrosion or scratches are smoothed out.  so far the red colored seals made 
out of silicon work very well and do not harden up like the blue originals or 
the black later ones.  Eric&amp;Barb
