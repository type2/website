&gt;  The 62-63 2/3 middle seat is fairly difficult to find, although you could
&gt;  always fake it by using a 64-65 seat and switching the grab handles.
&gt;  
&gt;  I also have a full-length 62-63 seat that I would trade for a short one...
&gt;  
&gt;  '67 seats have the kicked-out leg near the cargo doors.  '66 had this too?
&gt;   I'm not sure on that.
&gt;  
hm- interesting- I thought 62-66 was the same-   now 66 is different one year 
only as well as 67 (67s have the arm rest going the other way on the 2/3 
seats than the earlier ones) 

how is 62/63 diff from 64/65?
