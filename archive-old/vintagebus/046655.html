&lt;&lt;I'm wondering if it has more to do with spraying the lighter color first 
then 
the darker color.  Seems like the older busses had the darker color on top 
while the later had the lighter color on top.  Any painter out there who can 
tell us if this might be the case?&gt;&gt;

I've seen a number of sealing vax red busses with HUGE amounts of red showing 
through the white on the roof.
They painted the entire bus the bottom color, and masked off the bottom and 
sprayed the roof, and in later busses, also the dash.
