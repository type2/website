&gt; DO not waste your money of that stuff (B-Quiet) I tried it on one of my 
other 
&gt; 
&gt;  cars... It went on easy enough, a lot easier than Dynamat, BUT when it got 
&gt;  hot outside (summer) the adhesive started to melt and it would slide 
around 
&gt;  or down AND it bled through the vinyl backing and it's nasty when that 
&gt;  happens (stains your hands and whatever clothing/interior that touches. 
Just 
&gt; 
&gt;  spend the extra $$ on Dynamat ( I know I will when I have a bus with an 
&gt;  interior) It really doesn't cost that much more.
&gt;  Thanks,

Thanks for the info, I guess that I will use Dynamat, it seems to be the best 
and when you invest your time, the $$$ saved can all be wasted if it does not 
work as you want.
