I gonna be heading to LV for spring break and was wondering if there is
going to be any shows going on next week.  Or if anybody knows of any good
VW scrap yards or shops that they can let me know about.  I'll be heading
from Boise going through Utah most of the way.  First long road trip since
I lowered the bus!  Should be interesting.
