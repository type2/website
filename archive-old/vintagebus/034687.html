 1 of my originals has the part # stamping offset such that the part # is off
 the edge a little, must have been a production mistake.  That's an original
 Barndoor one too, they were probably doing it by hand back then.  ;(

the round mirror that was on my 53 standard when I got it had no stamping on 
it, the bus had sat since 66 when I got it, but I cannot swear it is the 
original mirror.  I put new glass in it, as the old glass was all fogged and 
ugly and non functional.
