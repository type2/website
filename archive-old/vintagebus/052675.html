I have a HBF 80 sandblaster. Hates play sand, clogs it. Like black
beauty, big tip, full sand flow at tip valve, lots of air.

Put the 80 towards a good one...like a TIP or some other quality
blaster.  Also make sure your air is DRY!

&gt; Harbor Freight has a 40 pound pressurized sand blaster on sale for
&gt; $80. Anyone have one or Used One?  Are they any good? I have one of
&gt; their venturi type units that sucks the sand out of a bag. It sure is
&gt; slow. Is the pressurized unit better? Time to blast out the rust from
&gt; behind the nose skin.
