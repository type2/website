 Hi all-

For those in the San Diego area (or nearby), there is a car show sponsored
by Coronado Mainstreet on April 18th.  It is held in conjunction with the
annual Coronado Flower Show, and usually draws a pretty good crowd.
Unfortunately, I don't think I have ever seen any busses on display in
previous years.

P.S. Please don't enter if your bus is really nice, I don't want to look bad!

On the same day, April 18th, there is a vintage only VW show in Carlsbad, CA (just north of San
Diego).  It is hosted by SVII's.  Lots of busses, good food, and a 60's costume contest.  Check
the SVII site for show details.
