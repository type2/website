    My 1966 bus was recently converted to 6 volts and everything runs
smooth except the emegency flashers and the fuel guage.  I think that I
have the emergency flasher problem licked thanks to Wolfsburg West
(great bunch of people).  I have attempted to find the problem with the
fuel guage but to no avail.  I have 12 volts coming to the guage and
proper grounding but she no work.  I have tried another 6 volt guage but
it did not work.  Can you use a 6 volt guage in a 12 volt system?

I figure to mean converted to 12V, right?

well, I guess you found you needed a 12V blinker box

the fuel guage may or may not work on 12V.    I guess it worked before the
switch, right?     Well, sometimes they work, and sometimes the extra voltage
can fry it.    

I am waiting on a source for 12V fuel gauges rebuildt, but it will not be the
cheapy deal.    Will let you all know when I do.
