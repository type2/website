Subject: re: plug blew out/need to know

I had this exact same thing happen to me, 1600dp, '67 Westy.  As I had to
replace the clutch anyway while I had the engine out I had a local mobile
mechanic install the insert in number 1 and it's worked fine ever since.
That was 4 years ago.  I wasn't real comfortable not pulling the head.  I
would have liked to see him use a vacuum cleaner or something to try and
pull any metal shavings out that may have fallen in the combustion chamber.
I was straped for cash.

the threads stripped. What I need to know is WHAT HAPPENED? HOW TO REPAIR
IT?
CAN I DO IT MYSELF?
