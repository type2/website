Subject: 61 roof rot (ooh nooo)

hi all,

After my friends all telling me i need to fix my roof here in the midwest
or im cruising for a bruising, i went and looked closer and found one
pinhole rust through about an inch above the rain gutter :(  Just barely
big enough that you could get the tip of a ballpoint pen in there... but
its a hole...)

So, even though i kinda like the rusty roof, looks like i have to fix it
before the miwestern humidity does it in.

I was thinking of using POR15 system.  wirebrush/Metalprep/por15/por15
primer/sand/regular primer/sand/paint.  But, i also have access to a
sandblaster, so that is an option as well... though the blasting may open
another pinhole or two, i do have access to a mig.

Anyone used POR15 in a situation like this where its a finish coat type
surface, thus far i have just used it up under the bus and on the floors
etc. no-where where the final coat of paint will be open to inspection...

I was thinking the POR15 will both add strength fill the pits a bit, and
give super secret extra added rustout protection.

Any opinions on how best to proceed?

thanks,

Steve White
