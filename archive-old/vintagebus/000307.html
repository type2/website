Hi yawl

  I have been away rom the list for a while and came back to a server that 
shut my account down so i lost allot of mail. I am looking for the person who 
was looking for the front mat for a 65 bus, and the person who is looking for 
bumpers (ribbed). I am back in my home town and can send these things out to 
you who wanted them.

please contact me by e-mail.

thanx,
chris.
