You trusted a tire shop employee!?That was mistake #1 and mistake #2 was not checking it on your own.Not to bitch but a torque wrench is your friend.

Hey volks, 
When this shows up for discussion,a light goes off in the dark file of the 
brain.
Several weeks ago I heard a noise that to me indicated a wheel bearing 
detonating
I got home &amp; examined the bearings, there was some indication of wear so I 
changed them.
Finished up &amp; took it out for a short drive, no sooner cleared the drive way 
&amp; there was that damned noise, pull back into the shop&amp; raise the front up.
I didn't mention it but I had not taken the lug nuts out just took off the 
wheel.
As I reached for the wheel to give it a shake, I noticed two of the lug bolts 
were missing...... And the others are loose... Dhu!  What gives?

I had the wheels powdercoated a few months back &amp; had new tires installed
last month, the tire guy said he had torqued every thing to specs. I'm 
wondering if powdercoating affected the torqueing of the wheels....._dot_causing 
them to become loose?
Any thoughts on this possibility?
