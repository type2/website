Subject: Re: [VB] Bus on Futurama &amp; 70's Show

I've seen it. The 30th century people ask where the time/space hyperdrive is and Fry, the 20th century character, pulls a bong from under a seat. Pretty good episode. 

Also, last night on That 70's Show, the green/white 21 Window is destroyed when it rolled off &quot;Mount Hump&quot;.
