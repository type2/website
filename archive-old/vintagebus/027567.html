&lt;&lt; There is a slight amount of play in the short shaft (the one the wheel 
mounts to).  How much play is allowable?&gt;&gt;
If you can only feel the play, but hardly see it at the tip of the axle then 
it should be fine.  If it is enough to see it easily it is too much.  Best at 
this point to drain that RGB into a clean drain pan.  Let the oil from it sit 
for a few minutes and then pour the oil into your recycle container and 
carefully take note of the shavings in the bootm of the drain pan.  Any 
shavings bigger than a pin head and/or dozen upon dozens of pin head size 
shavings means bad bearings.

   I'm wondering about the plug (211 501 249) at the back side of the 
reduction gear housing that must be removed for access to the nut on the 
inside end of the short shaft.  I have looked up  the part in a number of 
different catalogs, and the price of the plug varies from $14.50 down to 
$1.25!  There has to be some difference to make such a difference in price.&gt;&gt;
From what we have heard that is the differance between plastic plug and the 
stock style steel plug.  

&lt;&lt; Do I need to replace the plug,  who sells the best one, is the cheapest 
one good enough, etc.?&gt;&gt;
To remove the plug you either need to weld something to it and pull it, or as 
we do drill as close to center as possible.  Clean the seam between the RGB 
and the plug with a sharp tip of a knife like a Exacto to remove/breakup 
crusty dirt/rust and allow the plug to slide out easier.  Then use a body 
puller slide hammer screwed into the new hole in the plug to remove it.  
  We then drill/file a hex hole into the plug to weld a thin nut into it.  
Block the hole with a piece of bolt cut off and slotted with a hacksaw to 
allow unscrewing it later.  Install the cut off bolt with high temp silicon 
sealant and the plug is ready for installation with more silicon around it's 
circumference.  Then next time you need to remove the plug you just unscrew 
the cut off bolt piece and screw in one of the RGB half bolts to allow using 
a claw hammer to pull out the plug.  Walla you can repair it later on the 
road with no problems dealing with a stuck plug!  Eric&amp;Barb
