Hi Don,
If all the other gears are easy to shift into then fourth is more that likely 
shot.  If the tranny was driven in fourth gear most of the time it can fail 
way before any of the other gears.  When you changed the tranny oil did you 
get any or many chuncks of metal bigger than a pin head come out?
