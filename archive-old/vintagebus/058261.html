       My stud gun is one of my more favorite tools.  Makes shrinking a 
breeze and I've also used to fill small holes.  On the creases and bigger 
pullers I like tacking some scrape on, clamp it, and pull with my Morgan 
Knocker (very large slide hammer).  There are all sorts of gizmos out there.  

       The Dent Master is the next step up from a stud gun.  It has a single 
replaceable stud that it uses over and over. Leverage comes from a bar with a 
slot in it (the stud and handle go through the slot) and a small padded foot 
on the other end.  When your done pulling you just twist the stud and go on 
to the pull.
       If you have money to burn there is a neat setup that welds a wire to 
the metal.  The wire looks like this WWWWWWWW     The bottom of wire is spot 
welded to the panel, hooks go through the top for pulling.  This wire can be 
bent to fit again any curve or dip.  Its a very neat toy.  It can also spot 
weld and shrink.

       Peace'
