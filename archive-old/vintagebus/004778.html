&gt; Great; are we going to have another round to see who can out-hoopty the
&gt; rest on the road to jerome?

However it gets here, this is what the bus culture is all about. No asphalt,
no convenience stores, no waxing. Just hundreds of bus folk camping and
hanging out with the sounds of a steam sawmill blowing smoke rings up the
hill. Even though it is a lot of work, it is still my favorite event of the
year. From the world famous slow drags to the twilite raffles, no event
compares. You set up camp and you're done. No driving and no need to polish
your bus. If it is good enough to win in the top 20 car show, we can look
through the dust and tell.

See you there, or not.
