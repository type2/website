Looking for vent windows for my '67(I have the glass, but the frames are
shot), also the chrome plates that are mounted to the frame which the vent
latch grabs. I have the camper jalousie windows to trade or sell ( replaced
with solid windows).

Additionally, the bus was totally stripped inside when I bought it. Does
anyone have a picture looking forward at the nose panel with the interior
panel removed. I want to see how everything was laid out.

Side pop out windows?

Thanks

Jerry
