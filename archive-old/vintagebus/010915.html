&lt;&lt; I saw the thread recently about the quality of safaris and ideas for design
 improvement.  Sounds like none is thrilled with any of them.  Nonetheless, I
 definitely want safaris in my bus.  Can anyone list what the options are for
 repro safaris and the general opinion on each?  So far I have...

 Anymore?

Originals are the best.  Cost more, and tend to need restoration. Better 
frames and latches

, some of the repro frames will flex and glass break (I saw this happen on 
some izzy's windows, but I heard they had uprgraded the windows again since 
then)  Also some of the repro latches are notorious for breaking, the old bus 
boys ones that is.

The bottom line IMOPBO, is that safaris will leak.   They are great on hot 
sunny days.   If you live in a dry hot climate go for it. If you only driive 
on nice days, go for it.   If not, think hard about it, and make sure you 
have a place to park it out of the rain.  ANy one with a daily driver with 
safaris in the PNW will hate it most of the time.
