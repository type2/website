Subject: help: shudder from a rear wheel

I think that all this talk about bearings and redux boxes lately has
jinxed me.

I'm getting a clicking noise accompanied by a vibration from one of my
rear wheels.

I can reproduce it by pushing the bus with the engine off.

I can NOT reproduce it with the wheel in the air.

I'm hoping this isn't the diff.

Does anyone have any thoughts beside bearings?

Thanks,
...Markus (and Tardis)
