Subject: Re: [T2] Have to disable a bus

&gt; I found a buyer for the pristine 67 Deluxe, problem is he is only 15 years
&gt; old and his mom does not trust him. Apparently, he wears tie-dye so must do
&gt; drugs and stuff like that. In addition, his hair is kinda shaggy looking.

well as a parent of 6 now adult children.
&gt;
&gt; Anyway, his mom has agreed to cough up the cash for him (money not a problem
&gt; in that family) but she wants me to disable the bus, as she is afraid he
&gt; will try to drive it w/o his license. She knows that VW buses are unsafe and
&gt; she wants it stopped forever, not a temporary disabling. I thought about
&gt; pouring something in the crankcase just after I deliver it to seize the
&gt; whole thing up after a few miles but kinda hate to do that to the original
&gt; engine, as it runs so sweet. A bad dizzy cap kept it parked inside 30 years.
&gt; I know it is a real find but money talks here.

sell it &quot;as is&quot; let them work it out, if it is that sweet you could find
another buyer.  or hold it for the kid to pay for it himself, by then he
will be closer to 16

&gt; Another idea is to try to rip out some wires under the bus as it has a belly
&gt; pan due to the double sliding doors.  Must have been a right hand drive
&gt; option.

don't mess with a rare bus like that.

&gt;
&gt; The kid is a straight A student so will figure out anything obvious.

the old phrase  &quot;SEP&quot;   somebody elses problem.   I would not get involved
in any thing like that, especially if the kid doesn't know. he has
seen/heard it run. if he is that smart he will &quot;know&quot; if it is sabatoged

my opinion,, this is between mother and son,  look for another buyer this
is trouble.
