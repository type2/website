No....&quot;they&quot; didn't do anything.  A transaction is a two person affair.  Its
all the greedy people who have sold the busses to &quot;them&quot; that have driven up
the prices.  Unfortunately,  some people just view busses as a commodity.
Something to turn a profit on.  Others....most of us here, view them as
special, different and unique modes of transportation.

There are definitely two camps.   The enthusiasts and the speculators.  You see
them at every show, here in Southern Ca at least.  I've learned who they are an
refuse to buy from them.  They have a very elitist (who the hell can figure
that one out...its a VW bus not a Ferrari ) attitude and usually want WAY too
much for their precious nick knack.  I just smirk and walk away.

If you think its getting bad, just wait till VW realizes the &quot;new&quot; bus.  Talk
about bringing attention to busses.  It won't be one aging 80's rock star going
through a mid life crisis, it'll be 20 something's asking daddy for a loan to
buy that 'cute' bus like thingy at the VW dealer that will create a pop
interest in 50's/60's busses.  Don't despair though.  The natural ebb and flow
of the market will come.  Just ask Ronnie about the ups and downs of the 356
market.  It will get worse before it gets better for us enthusiasts.

 BTW besides Eddy, I had a productive outing at OCTO, finding my front seat and
air cleaner I'd been looking for....about as many busses and listees as last
time.  I spotted 'darth', (but didn't say hi as you were parking), Everett
(also didn't get a chance to chat), Katie &amp; Matt, &amp; Jim (don't call me Robert
Davis) Ellis....I accidentally introduced my friend to him by calling Jim
&quot;Robert&quot;....doh!   Sorry Jim and Robert...arn't you two long lost brothers or
something like that ;-)!   Hey...it was early :-)    Anyone else get some good
stuff?  There was a Westy tent railing there (long part) but it was $100 and
you still need the short piece. I have one so I passed. A bay window tent 8
bills...OUCH!   Who has all the original Safari parts?  I have frames glass,
sliders and latches....I need the rest.  I'm tired of asking the F'n
pretentious chicken wire box people!  Good show though.

&gt; What about the thousands of OG buses that went to Japan with the Japanese
&gt; doing all kinds of sh--t to them ? They've done more to drive the prices up
&gt; then anyone one celebrity.
