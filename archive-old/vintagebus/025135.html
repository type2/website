Subject: &quot;58&quot; Gear Shift Lever?
Message-ID: &lt;3723BAF9.DF00779F_at_frognet_dot_net&gt;

After a four year restoration Patty and I got the 58 double door panel
on the road this past saturday. Everything went perfectly but I do have
one small question for you guys. My gear shift lever turns 360 degrees.
Is this correct? I checked the entire system and I did not see anyway
for it not to turn in a full circle. This condition prohibits me form
using any shift extender.
Thank you.
