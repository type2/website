&gt; Does anybody have some helpful hints on repairing a chip-up, crack, chunks

&gt; will be very greatfull
how i've been told to do it:

grind the cracks into v shaped grooves, fill with epoxy putty (comes in 2
sticks of putty you cut off equal sized pieces from both sticks, knead
together) smooth it pretty much like you want it as its hard to sand.

sand and paint.

thats it,
