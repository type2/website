Subject: PNWers going to Sacto on Labor day

Hi All,

Is anyone going to the sacto show in Sacramento CA on labor day in two weeks
that either live in the Boise area or that will be traveling through
LaGrande OR on I84 on the way back home and that could carry some cargo back
for me?  I have an og empi rear seat that I've been trying to get up here
for about a year and I have someone that can get it to Sacramento...  I have
an uncle in Nampa that could pick it up from you if you live in the Boise
area or if you're traveling home along I84 through beautiful eastern Oregon,
you could drop it off at my place.

The seat is too big to ship so you'll need a bit of space free to carry it.


Let me know.

David
