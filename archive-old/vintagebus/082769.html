Hi  Clara,

Did you make the Shasta trip in the baja barndoor? I trust youse  volks made
it back home from foggy  Utah?

Regards,

Tom


yup.. it has been an epic adventure.  It was 17F at a gas station  before we 
climbed out of the SLC valley, colder over the mountains into  Idaho.  thank 
you much for your hospitality.  Now we're in Oly and I'm  furiously making 
panels for people.  Spent long hours at the end of  January to revive the barndoor 
Baja truck to take it to Shasta w/ no  wipers. 
 
The truck made the Shasta trip with verve and elan... really is built for  
offroading... rocks... don't barely feel them... slippery roads... not a  
problem... ramming snow banks is fun with hurky ugly bumper, which is good  for 
tying a cable to when stuck in a river.   pulled the motor due to  a totally fried 
clutch on the side of the road after a river crossing, then had  to push 
start it every time as we put in a 12 V FW w/ big clutch  as no  spare small 
clutch parts were taken with, which does not jive w/ the 6V  starter.  needed to 
have cleaned up more connections for better  lights. no heat... tubes were AWOL 
from under the bus.. the metal  tubes...the ones that were once welded in 
place... not exactly in tip top  shape but the mystery motor preformed well. LOL.  
 there are some  pics up on the samba gallery.  Search for 'Shasta'.  U-boat 
Mike just  put up some new ones.
