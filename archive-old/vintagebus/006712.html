if your engine has done so good , I wouldn't add gauges, that could create
some bad karma with your engine, very interesting survey, maybe I'll use the
syn oil on my new 1776 single port, I'll know after I tear the 1600 new VW
mexican engine down after the swap, it'll have about 35,00 hard miles by
then.

As far as heads, there are 3 long reach duel port heads made with VW
stampings, not counting CB's own brand and MoFoCo's so you have a choice of
5 different castings, stay away from the cheap Brazilian, CB's have valves
from Isreal, the rest I don't know where the valves come from, but a lot of
the valves used today are made in Taiwan, I use only Manley valves when I
have my heads done, 200.00 dollars per head on my single ports, open for
90.5's, deck and CC, install new valve seats (40 and 35.5), 3 angle valve
job, match all spring tensions to specs, hifh rev springs, cromalloy
retainers and keepers, silicon bronz valve guides, seems like a lot of work
but the last 2 engines I had heads built to these specs are still going
strong after much abuse and many miles.

&lt;&lt; Now I have some questions. Does anybody have any experience with
 aftermarket DP heads? Are the ones with 3/4&quot; spark plug threads any
 good? What about valves? Anything better than stock? &gt;&gt;
Hi John,
From what we have heard that is the way to go if you want DP heads.  You 
might want to give Bear's VW Machine in San Diego for these new and have
them 
install exhaust valves with thicker stems to help prevent dropping another 
valve!   Thanks for the interesting and detailed info.  It would be 
interesting to hear how your next engine does with gauges.   Eric&amp;Barb
