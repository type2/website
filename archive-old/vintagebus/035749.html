Obligatory warning:  This got a little longer than I had planned...

Last Sunday night I got a call from buddy and fellow list member Pink Newell 
telling me of a Barndoor for sale (Thanks Pink!!)  Pink and I had met the 
owner of this Bus about 4 years ago and the RMMW show in Colorado.  The guy 
had driven the Barndoor al the way from southern New Mexico to get to the 
show.  Cool.  I hadn't really been looking for a Barndoor or any other new 
bus for that matter but I remembered this bus being very solid for a '73 let 
alone a '53.  Pink and I discussed the condition of the bus for a bit and I 
got the owners phone number.

I real quick called one other buddy who knows the bus to see if his 
recollection was the same as Pink and I.  The response was &quot;If you don't buy 
it I will&quot;  That was all I needed.  I called the owner, and within about 15 
minutes I had bought it.

Monday I spent a good part of the day calling transport services to arrange 
for transportation.  Prices quoted ranged from $595 to $1245, most of them 
around $750.  I felt real comfortable with a company that was going to charge 
$650. As Monday night rolled around I was getting very eager to execute this 
deal.  After much pondering and a few discussions with a couple of other Bus 
nuts I decided to just go get it myself.  It is amazing how quickly 
everything just fell into place.  Within an hour of the decision I had a tow 
dolly loaned to me and a bus nut copilot. 8-)

The original plan was to leave early Wednesday morning but everything was 
ready to go by Tuesday noon so I hit the bank, then hit the road.  Mike, my 
copilot, and made it to a rest stop just outside of Amarillo that night.  
That was going to put us into New Mexico away ahead of schedule so we decided 
to hit some salvage yards on the way there.  To make it short we found some 
good stuff but came up empty handed.  For anyone interested there is a great 
salvage yard in Roswell, NM - A1 or something like that - right off of truck 
route 70 on the northside of town.  Unfortunately he won't sell parts, just 
complete vehicles.  Really he wants to sell everything.  If anyone has 
$30,000 laying around he has 14 busses and 300 bugs for you.  He does have a 
'56 or '57 ghia for sale, $1,500 and a earlyish single cab with semaphores 
for $900, both are solid but major projects.  Pmail me if you are interested.

After the shutout in Roswell me scooted on down to the rendevouz point.  
Found the house no problem.  Best thing was the bus was better than I 
remembered.  Every time I had seen it, it had been loaded full of swapmeet 
stuff and camping gear.  I had noticed rust by the cargo door and assumed 
there was more.  Well, I was pleasantly surprised to find that was the rust.  
All the rust was confined to this area and except for a quarter sized spot in 
the battery tray.  There was no other cancer  8-)  Oh yeah!! 

We loaded up the bus with all the other parts -- including a Barndoor middle 
seat -- then put the bus on the tow dolly and headed out.  Plan was to go to 
Albuquerque and stay with my wife's aunt.  Since &quot;Everywhere Ed&quot; is on the 
way we decided to stop and see him.

What a place the bus barn is!  Lots of stuff everywhere and some of the most 
mutated busses around.  Ed really does his best to save everything.  His 
current project is a sight to behold.  Mike bought a 15&quot; rim while we were 
there which would come in handy the next day.  After an hour or so at Ed's we 
went to the Aunts house and crashed.  The bed felt great compared to sleeping 
in the Jetta as we had the night before.

Thursday morning we left Albuquerque and headed for home.  I have a habit of 
getting the biggest size drink available whenever stopping for gas.  This 
time it paid off.  After about an hour of driving I was doing the seated 
version of the wee wee dance.  Had to pull over release pressure.  When I got 
out of the car and went back by the bus I heard this &quot;Wssssssssssss&quot;  Uh oh.  
Turn out one of the rear ties had picked up something and was leaking.  Damn.

We rolled the bus off the dolly and switched the front and rear tires then 
pushed her back on the dolly.  We cinched her back down and headed out. About 
twenty minutes later &quot;wuwuwump thththtthththth&quot;.  A tire on the dolly had 
just separated and thrown it's tread.  Scared the hell out of me.  All I 
could see in my minds eye was the Barndoor doing somersaults past me.  
Luckily I was able to get the rig to the side without any problem.  We were 
alone on the road at the time so the flying tread didn't hit anyone.  We 
changed that wheel, the spare had a brand new tire, and headed back out.  

Since we had no more spares we needed to stop as soon as possible and get 
some tires.  We stopped at the next opportunity which was Santa Rosa.  When 
all was said and done they plugged one tire for $7 and sold me a piece of 
crap used tire for $20 which we put on the rim Mike had bought the day 
before.  I was feeling a bit dorked on the used tire since a new one could be 
had for $45 or so.  (neighbor is a tire wholesaler so I will get a new one at 
home)  While waiting I asked the owner if there were any old busses in town.  
turns out they had one in there &quot;Lot&quot;  Hmmm.

After a bit the owner had one of their tow truck drivers take Mike and I out 
to the lot.  The driver was less intelligent Hispanic version of Earnest as 
in &quot;Know what I mean Vern?&quot; Earnest.  As he drove through the school zone at 
60 I knew we were in for a ride.  The road out to the lot was hilly with lot 
of curves.  As we round a corner on two wheels our driver says &quot;Thees is 
where a couple of guy got keeled.  Dey was drunk&quot;  Amazingly enough we 
arrived safely at the lot.  There was a bus there but it was a Bay Window.  
Mike grabbed a few goodies from it while I scouted around.  Found a crunched 
bug but nothing special.  However, in the car next to it was a ton of Army 
stuff.  I pulled out a Poncho, a 2 piece rain suit, and some extreme cold 
weather pants.  Cool.

When we finally made it back to the shop the owner looked a little pissed 
that Mike had the parts.  Apparently they had neglected to tell us they 
wanted to sell the bus complete - must be a New Mexico thing.  Mike ended up 
with the stuff for $20 though.  They said I could have the stuff I found - 
doesn't rain much in NM.  So I ended up paying $20 for a $5 - $10 tire and $0 
for about $100 worth of army gear.  I'm okay with that. 

As we neared the TX / OK border the wind was picking up.  When we stopped for 
gas they told us about the Sever thunderstorm warnings and the Tornado watch. 
 Oh Joy.  We hopped in the car in hopes of out running the worst of it.  When 
the radio talked about golf ball size and tornados on our tail we put the 
pedal to the metal.  must have been going 60mph!  Jettas pulling Busses don't 
move too fast even with a motivated driver.

We managed to get away from the tornados and hail and stopped driving about 
midnight.  With Mike being the taller of the two he got to sleep in the 
longer Barndoor middle seat while I took the back of the Jetta.  About two 
hours later the storm hit.  No hail but man did it rain.  I was afraid we 
were going to float away.  In the morning all the fields were flooded.  I'm 
not exactly how much rain fell that night but it was several inches.  We 
headed out about 7am and hit home about noon.    

All in all it was a great trip.  Bottom line is it cost me $275 to go get the 
bus and I had it in 5 days vs. $650 and up to 3 weeks to have it hauled.  Not 
too bad.  The extra $375 will buy a few of the parts I need for the '53.

If anyone is ever in the Kansas City are drop me a line and I'll give you a 
cruise around the block in a Barndoor.  8-)  Thanks for listening.
