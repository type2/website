Subject: RE: [VB] Alternator Q

Sean and Bob, I have seen the Chrysler/Dodge/Plymouth 4 wire voltage
regulator successfully adapted for the three prong alternators, and they are
cheap. The fourth wire, I think brown, is a ground. Get the ones for the
Dodge Dart, Plymouth Barracuda, or Valiant with the slant six. The last two
I bought were about $17 each at FLAPS. Let me know if you need a wiring
diagram and I will try and scan one off for you.

Sean -
What you have is an externally regulated alternator. Hence the 3 prongs. To
use it you would need to acquire a regulator and wire it to the 3 terminals.
The B+ goes to the starter as the charge line to the battery. I used one of
those alternators years ago on a bug but I had the donor car for the voltage
regulator and the plug that fits the alternator. As for testing it take it
down to you local auto parts house and have it tested(pulley attached - fan
not attached). If it tests good, then if you want to use it a trip to the
local junk yard could yield you the plug and regulator. Also you might wanna
check the price on a new regulator due to the price of a new one (no idea of
the cost) maybe your best bet would be to go with a new internally regulated
one (to me your best bet for around a hundred or so). Also depending on what
you plan as far as power draw to your system (ie radio, lights, etc.). Stock
generator output 30 amps - Alternator output I think 50-55 amps. All is
dependant on funds. I know that tune.
