Subject: Re: [VB] 65' brake system question

 It is a good thing to periodically inspect the brakes.   I mean, how can anyone tell what you need from miles away?   You can do a quick inspection now, ie pull drums and peel back dust covers on wheel cyliners, if there is any ooze they need to be rebuildt or replaced.  Check master as well.   Are shoes worn?   How old are the flex lines?     I find that rarely is the master bad, but it does happen.   When you do your brakes, if the reservoir is dirty, wipe it out with rubbing alcohol (after flushing the dirty fluid out enough to have the reservoir empty).  Flush the system with clean new fluid every two years.  When it's hard to tell the level of the brake fluid without backlighting you've got it clean.

It's easy to grease the suspension when you're doing the brakes.  grease is good.

 Hi Tracey,
&gt; You are just going to have to take the entire system apart, clean, inspect 
&gt; and replace what has gone bad.  All brake cylinders will 
&gt; have to be taken apart
