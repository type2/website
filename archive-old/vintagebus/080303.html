Subject: Something broke....

On the way back to work from running errons (work related actually) 
something broke on my '61 Rat Rod Double Cab. The engine acted like it had 
pulsating power. Almost like clutch slip or something. I was close enough 
to work to basically coast into the parking lot. Sounds like something 
bouncing and banging when the engine is running. I'm thinking I lost some 
part of the clutch system. Or, maybe the gland nut came loose or something 
goofy like that. Something ain't right.

I'll end up towing or trailering home so I don't do any more damage. 
Bummer. Had a free weekend coming up as the wife and kids are leaving town 
to visit her family for Mother's Day. Good thing is they're leaving today, 
so maybe I can just get after it tonight and get something done. Figure 
I'll work in the carport since we've got nice weather and my shop is full 
of &quot;in progress&quot; VW's right now. Don't know for sure.

Clutch problem would be the best. I can get parts local. Keep your fingers 
crossed!
