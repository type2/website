I almost forgot!  I am in the process of going through the electrical on my
'67 Westy.  Various things do not work of course, but it's worse than usual.
The wiring is in really nasty shape.  Most of the wiring in the engine 
compartment is non-original, taped-up, spliced stuff that goes who knows where.
One of the more interesting hacks I found was two wires going the the same
connector on the pass. side tail-light.  In addition, there is not a trace of
the wire from the turn signal to that light...

Here's the question.  I can do three things: patch this mess (cheap, but 
difficult and it'll look like hell and probably be about as reliable as
a politician under oath), get a brand new harness ($$$), or use the harness
out of my '67 Kombi.  I'd like to do the latter, as the wiring in the Kombi is 
in pretty decent shape.  But how hard would that be?  How about with the wiring
for the Westy stuff like interior lights?  It &quot;seems&quot; to be completely
by itself.  Should I just spend the money for a new harness?

FYI, the Kombi is destined to be a parts bus due to frame damage.
