&lt;&lt; It's a '75 case with a vac adv disty and a 34 pict-3 carb. I'm really 
green in this area so ANY input would be great. Right now it's at 10.5 BTDC 
and it SEEMS OK. I'd just like to know where it should be. &gt;&gt;
Hi Rex to be able to tell you need to figure out which distributor you have 
first.

&lt;&lt; I ended upwiring it open and disconnecting the wire. I don't know how 
setup the
choke. What's the procedure for that?&gt;&gt;
Loosen the three screws that hold the choke element in the carb.  Then turn 
the element counterclockwise for less or shorter choke.  Clockwise for more 
or longer choke.
