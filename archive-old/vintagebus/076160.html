Subject: RE: [VB] My buses are going up for sale

Well,

Here is a sad story.  I USED to have:  '66 (My Sweet Bus), '67 parts bus,
badly rusted out, but Kelly could do a Metalwiz job on it easy, 70 Bug, '71
Sqbk, '65 Bug w/hardtop sun roof, Manx w/ a late '50's pan (shortened) and a
'74 Bug.  Actually, I still have them all but the parts bus and the '70 Bug.

I had all but MSB stored at a friend's 5 acre property about 10 miles south of
Provo.  Well, housing developments went up around him.  He is still zoned
agricultural and put a huge warehouse/workshop on it.  The city wuz ticked off
at him, so they gave him a citation for the old cars on the property.  I had
like 3 daze to get rid of them.  Oh me, oh my, did I shed tears.  I sent to
the parts bus and the '70 Bug off to the junk yard that has a lot of them and
they promised to keep them for parts, as they do have several already (no
splitties though)  I'd have liked to have gotten the tranny out (condition??)
and the wiper motor.  I did manage to pull a few parts off, but the cargo
doors . . . tears, tears and more tears.

The '70 Bug was in excellent, restorable condition, no rust, just the rear
window shot out.  The '65 Bug we towed home and got &quot;on the road&quot;--benefit of
son with emissions and safety certification.  The engine needs a little
attention and a new pressure plate--going in tonite.   Ditto the '74 (new
coil, someone tried to steal it and fried the wires last summer) which is
going to go up for sale as it is in decent condition.

The Sqbk-'71 is sitting in the driveway, awaiting a total resto this fall when
son enters a year-long autobody course at the local college.  The Manx also
sits in the driveway.  In sad shape, no motor, but good tires and restorable.
We have an engine block machined and partially put together to put in her.
The local Sand Dunes beckon . . . she'll be ugly but street legal.

Here in Provo the cops are eagle eyes for cars parked in the same place for
more than a couple of daze.  Heck, in Feb. I bought a '92 Camry from a couple
around the corner, for my son.  They took the plates off at the time of the
sale.  Fair enough.  I drove it around the corner to the house and parked it
out front, went to work for an hour and a half, intending to come home to
inspect and license it.  Cops beat me too it.  Ten dollar
unregistered-vehicle-on-the-street ticket.  (thats why we registered the Bugs
with still no egines in them)  I contested it and won when I showed it was
registered the same day as the ticked was issued.

All this and I am leaving for Oz in 10 daze!  Gimme a break!  I bet I come
home to tickets on the Manx and '71 Sqbk for being &quot;visible from the street.)
