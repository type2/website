 Found a Schwinn tandem twinn bike in town and the guy wants $185 for it.
Need to know if it is worth it or not. It's candy orange/gold color, single
speed, chrome finders, rear coaster brake,white pinstripe and lettering.
Don't know year, is above enough to know what it is?? Will look good on the
bus roofrack and maybe I can get Ronnie to ride double with me! Bike has
been sitting for years but is ridable as is air in tires ect. Pmail me if
you have info, thanks, VWHOWARD.
