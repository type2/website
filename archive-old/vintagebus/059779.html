&gt;&gt;A while back, last winter or early spring, I &quot;ran&quot; into a nice site that
spelled out how to install front door seals per the original diagonal cuts
and trims.  Man, I hit the print button quick smart.  Now I can't find the
two sheets of paper for the life of me, and I can't find the site surfing
for it.

It included overall &quot;big picture&quot; graphics and a couple of closeups for the
angle trims etc.

Where, where, where?
