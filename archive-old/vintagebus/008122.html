OK OK nough said,,, then I should get both heads new. The only reason I'm
looking to replace it is because one of the heads has broken off exhaust
stud, broken off with part of the head as well. Cool, thanks.

&gt; Simply put - go with new.  Do you know what rebuilt means?  For GEX it
&gt; means, &quot;Spec all the parts.  If anything is within toleraance, leave it
&gt; alone (even if it will wear out in 5 miles).  Bead blast the old valves,
&gt; grind them, lap them in, and sell as rebuilt.  When the heads pops off one
&gt; of the exhaust valves in about 3K miles, remind the customer they bought
&gt; &quot;rebuilt&quot; heads.&quot;
&gt;
&gt; The only way to go is new because it will MATCH the parts and the life of
&gt; the rest of the engine.  Otherwise, plan on an early rebuild in uder
20,000
&gt; miles.
&gt;
&gt; I learned the hard way and will NEVER go with out sourced rebuilt heads.
&gt; The ONLY rebuilt heads I would use are ones that I bought new valves and
&gt; guides for and did the machine work myself.
