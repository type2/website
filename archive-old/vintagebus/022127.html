&gt;      Stock pulleys vary as to timing notches -- but I think 3 of them

&gt;first two, or 2.5 degrees left.

In the &quot;Bizzaro World&quot; where clocks run backwards.... ;)

Those timing marks are BTDC (before top dead center) not ATDC (after top 
dead center).  Turn the pulley clockwise (non-bizzaro world clockwise) 
and watch the marks if you don't believe me!

&gt;Then forget the timing light, just set
&gt;it statically -- pull the coil wire off the dizzy, turn on the
&gt;ignition,  have the pulley lined up exactly with the new 10 degree mark
&gt;at the case center crack, and turn the dizzy back and forth until you
&gt;get a nice spark from the coil wire.

I do not agree with setting the timing on a 009 statically...  The 
advance curves on 009 distributors tend to vary from distributor to 
distributor.  You are much better off statically timing it at TDC to 
get it to start and then timing it at about 30 degrees at total 
advance with your timing light.
