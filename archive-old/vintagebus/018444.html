&gt; I was wondering how Thom sees behind his panel while he's driving ?

Behind?  There's a behind?

&gt; No rear window and the little round mirrors !!

Well, in all honesty, the little rear window in a panel, coupled with
the little divider window, don't make much for a rear view...

&gt; Have you ever left the right lane ?

There's other lanes?  Wow!

&gt; Is changing lanes conducted via the braille method ?

Actually, I have the passenger side mirror biased more away
from the car, which works quite well.  I still have to plan lane changes well 
in advance.

&gt; How many neighborhood kids have you backed over ? :-)

The Zero Population Growth Committee sponsored the restoration of my panel!
