Subject: Trip speedo problem
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com, list_at_hvwc_dot_net

OK, I went off the deep end for Christmas and bought myself a trip speedo. It 
is perfect looking shows 40k miles and only needed the faded gels replaced 
(which I did)  The problem is ... when I get close to 100 miles the 1 
overturns by half a turn. It gets stuck halfway between 1 and 2, and stays 
this way up through 300+ (haven't let it go any higher, I love resetting it)
It's not really that big of a deal I can tell how many miles I've gone, I 
just was curious if there is an easy fix to this. I don't really want to take 
it apart to &quot;try and fix it&quot; Has anyone seen this problem?
Thanks,
Brian
