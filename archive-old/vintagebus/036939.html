205/75/15  Cornell is the label on the  tyres that I out on the back of my 63
singlecab.  They were from Pep Boys and I think cost almost 1/2 of what you
paid.  Check out Pep Boys for 15&quot; tyres.  They seem to be just fine but I have
yet to do a RPM check to fin out what rpm's per mph.  Still complicated by the
fact that I have 165R15's on the front.

They have a max load of 1600 lbs. So I do not I will have a load problem.
