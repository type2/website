Ray,  is the fulcrum plate the plate that pivots _at_ the body and is bolted
onto the redux boxes? I had loud clunks as you describe and replaced the
bolts holding this plate onto the redux boxes (clean thread with bottoming
tap) and it all went away.

Subject: axle question


&gt;      I am gathering parts for a transaxle swap/redux rebuild for my '66
&gt;      standard.  Evreyone that I've talked to or seen advertised sells
&gt;      rebuilt transaxles without nose cones, axles, and redux boxes.  The
&gt;      reason I'm looking for a rebuilt unit is that I believe my fulcrum
&gt;      plates are worn and are the reason I'm getting loud metal clanking
&gt;      noises every time I accelerate.  I'm also assuming the paddle ends of
&gt;      the axles are equally as worn but won't know this until I start
&gt;      removing them.  I am not interested in taking on the job of doing the
&gt;      rebuild myself, just the swap will be hard enough, physically on this
&gt;      old, abused body.
&gt;
&gt;      In preparation for this bigass job I'm gathering parts now.  The
&gt;      questions are:
&gt;         Once I get them out, how do I measure my current axles at the
&gt;      paddle end to determine their worthiness?
&gt;
&gt;         If I need replacements where do I get them?
&gt;
&gt;         I have a set of axles that look very nice with redux boxes that
are
&gt;      identical to Lea's '63 single cab.  I've been saving them for the day
&gt;      when her vehicle might need them.  Does anyone know whether these
&gt;      axles are the same length and design as mine in the '66?  Are axles
&gt;      generally interchangeable?  I know the redux boxes and stub axles are
&gt;      very different but I don't need to swap those.
&gt;
&gt;      Hoping for enlightenment.
