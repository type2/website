I wrote the original email on this thread.  I too have a sway bar on the
front end, however with drum brakes. What is a camber compensator?  How did
you install the disk brakes on the front. I know that there are several kits
out there. You seem to like the way your disks work. Can you give any
recommendations for a supplier?



Chris,
A Camber compensator is an after market device that attaches to the Trans and
swing arms in back. It functions as the equivalent of a rear sway bar. The
design of swing arms doesn't allow a regular sway bar to be installed. This
reduces sway in turn and increases stability of our rather tall vehicles. The
tallness is important in two areas. First, sensitivity to cross winds,
created either by real wind or by the wake blown off of trucks. These winds
blow us around much more than smaller shorter vehicles. Being blown around
makes it harder to control the vehicle, increasing the work of driving and
reducing the pleasure. Second, our big boxes have a relatively high center of
gravity. The inertia of the bus acts as if it is all located at the center of
gravity when you turn. When this is higher, it puts more force on the
suspension during turns. Effective and balanced sway bars and camber
compensators help control this higher force. THE RESULT, calmer and more
predicable handling at regular speed, and safer at higher speed. Our antiques
were engineered to drive at 50-60 mph MAX. We now live in a world where this
speed is very uncomfortable on freeways. We now have tires that are safe at
higher speeds. The choice that has been made clear by many contributors to
the list is DRIVE AT THE DESIGN SPEED (50-60) and make the driving
accommodations to do this, or MAKE SOME MODS TO THE ANTIQUE and drive a
little faster. Each choice is valid. I have made mine.

Camber compensators are available used at most VW Junk Yards and from the
bone piles of most VW mechanics, as well as from Bus Boys and other
suppliers. There is some info in the archives on the extra stress and wear
that they put on transmission mounts. Nothing is free.

Disc Brake upgrade info is also in the archives. Very briefly: To upgrade to
discs, you need to get your front beam to accept the spindles off of a 71-79
bus. To do this you need ball joints instead of king pins. You can either get
a 68-69 beam, which has the ball joints and bolt right onto your earlier bus,
or Bus Boys now sells a modified torsion arm (need 4) that has ball joints
and bolts right onto the earlier beam (this is less work). Get used spindles
(71-72 have smaller discs and calipers than 73-79) and used hub carriers. You
will need new bearings and seals.  Most folks use the backing plate as well.
I had to trim mine to get rid of some rubbing.  You also need to install the
pressure reducer from the 71-79 bus to reduce the line pressure to the drums
in the rear, and a 2 LB check valve in the line to the Discs to keep the pads
near the discs. Also, you will need lug nuts for the front, not bolts, and
narrow 5 wheels instead of wide 5 wheels, new hub caps and maybe some other
parts I can't remember now.  When you do this, be sure that your components
in the rear are all in good shape. Bleed the brakes generously. I bleed and
flush the entire system in all my vehicles every year. If you get dead brakes
when you drive you get dead.
You can see that this is not a simple change out. You may be happy enough
just rebuilding your current drums to be sure they are up to specs. That my
provide you with all the brakes you need. Good luck and keep us posted.
