try vintage-vacations_dot_com...they sold the weather sttripping for the windows,
so they might have the cranks too. My bus has had two of the cranks replaced
by the PO, he supposedly got them from HEHR window directly, they are located
in CA somewhere...

let me know if you find them, i need to replace two on mine, but have never
quite gotten around to it...
