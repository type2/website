Subject: RE: [VB] Seals for the gas tank doors in the 66 SC treasure chest

I take it that the *doors* are the panels that separate the tool compartment
from the gas tank compartment...

From the remnants I found on my double cab, the seals on the two panels
appeared to be the same as that for the fresh air vent....  I've scavenged
seals from a number of fresh air vents but I have not been able to find nice
seals for those panels :-(

Basically, the seals are thin strips of butyl rubber.  I plan to make some
from sheets of butyl that I purchased from MSC.  Unless I can find someone
with some nice og ones.... hint hint.

Rob asked:  Looking for seals for the 2 doors inside of the treasure chest
that go to the gas tank area.  Anybody know what these are called or where
to look.
