VanBondo just recieved a cell phone call from 'Mexico Jack' Maynard.
Traveling north of Tucson, He and his wife are hoping to stop by and see my
vast acreage &lt; ;-) &gt; before I have to leave for the swing shift job. Given
enough time he will have use of my computer to post something and make
quickie emails to the appropriate folks and pig farmers up home.
