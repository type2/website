But how many times will you replace it? Labor is a lot more then the part. A
few dollars more you would have had NEW. I find that most Discount flaps
rebuilds are just cleaned and repainted with out any new parts except brushs
and that is only in some cases. Check it out carefully before you install it
and save a lot of headache in the future. A good thing to do is have them
put it on there tester and runit for a couple minutes to make sure it is
putting out and that they polerized it correctly. I have had customers with
reverse polerized generators from the discount flaps.


ronnie   just another of my personal opinions

	I just bought a rebuilt generator from Kragen for $39.95 + $15 core.
Thought I'de share the good deal.  If you call and ask it is listed as an
alternater.  I think the part number is 15270.  The only generator they
list is an $80 Bosch.  So if you want a good deal look for their $40
generator with a lifetime warrenty.  The one I bought was originaly made by
Bosch and rebuilt in some impoverished 3rd world country by barefoot
children.  But hay it only cost $40 and I never have to buy another one
again.
