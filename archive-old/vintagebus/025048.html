pat.

the ground wire for your gas gauge is your gauge itself!  try tightening
the little nuts that hold it to the metal harness that holds it to the
dash.  mine's been giving me trouble as well.  sounds like juice is
being re routed back through yours.  I'd try another gauge, check the
voltage, make sure everything's kosher and equal.  usually, the sender/
sensor in the tank is not the problem.
you may want to check the relay on the bright switch. I've the wrong
switch on my lights, so when I turn them on the gauge automatically
registers FULL.
6v gauges will work for a while, then fry out.  I just recently switched
to a 12v gas gauge.

&gt; Where exactly is the ground wire that attaches to or

&gt; my guage not to work. Additionally my high beams don't
&gt; want to switch off.  I looked for a dimmer switch on
&gt; the floor, after reading my (63-67 Bentley, $70 from
&gt; JC whitney after delivery!!!) I guess I don't have
&gt; one.  Is there a relay I need to replace or reground?
&gt; Slowly but surely I will fix everything up on the 67.
&gt; Also, can I remove the back/closer to front engine tin
&gt; w/out dropping the engine.  Ie: remove gas line and
&gt; starter bolt plus 2 egine tine screws.  Thanks for
&gt; putting up w/my LAMO questions.
