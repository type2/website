&gt;My first question for the list: what is the going price for z-beds such as
&gt;mine?

Around $10-20. If you feel disappointed, go out and gaze at your ==free==
middle seat and realize that they are becoming very rare and are unheard of
on $850 buses.

(discussion of &quot;the role of the newbie&quot; smells like a troll, skipped. =^ )

&gt;what about
&gt;&quot;check out this rust &lt;link&gt; what do I do first in my particular
&gt;circumstance?&quot;

Jeff is asking about the feasibility of (in effect) adding pictures to our
emails by adding links to the pictures (NOT by sending binaries or encoded
attachments to the emails which will get the message killed).

I could be overruled on this by either list owner but I think this is an
extremely sensible idea in those cases where pictures are worth a thousand
words. Listees reading from a browser or a savvy mail client can click back
and forth between the pic/page and the email, while those with simpler
browsers have relatively little HTML clutter to ignore. Remember that the
only thing worse than ASCII art is ASCII art without line endings,
witnesseth events of late. 8)
