Subject: Crew CAB almost done

My 1963 Crew cab is almost done after a year of waiting, The body shop
has finally painted it. I went to see it and it looks great. I just got
off the phone with West Coast Metric and ordered all new Rubber. Which
to my surprise was a hefty price. Wait till my wife finds out how much i
spent. I will post some pic's as soon as i pick up my bus. I have had
this bus for about 5 years and  i will finally have it complete.(after
install the interior components.
