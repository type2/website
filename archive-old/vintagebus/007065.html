All that reminds me that I was suppose to get together with a local guy that
has &quot;some&quot; VW parts. He doesn't even know what and a 70 Bay sitting behind
his barn. Place I came upon driving around one day. There's still too much
snow on the ground to go on checking the junk yards here. Weekend is shaping
up warmer. Cool.

&gt; I forgot to mention that I found a couple school buses.  Walking inside
&gt; these converted campers was neat - lots of neat ideas but at the same time
a
&gt; shame that someone's work is sitting in a heap like this.  One bus had an
&gt; old white beetle seat (lowback) sitting in it and the other one had an old
&gt; never opened set of VW pedal pads (with the V logo - not VW) so I grabbed
&gt; them as well.
