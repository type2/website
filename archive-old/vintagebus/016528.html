Rex has a point.  The reason I get my (most of) my projects done in
an expedient manner is not becaus I'm some bodywork god or mechanical
genius, but rather that I have nothing else to do with my time.  I
rarely watch TV, I'm not big on the party scene, and my only other obligation
is work.  I rarely work OT, and it's even rarer to have to work weekends.
So my routine is to come home from work, take a nap, change clothes, then
break out the tools.
