&gt;&gt;The amount exerted to the nut will always be &quot;less the amount used
&gt;&gt;to deflect the shaft around it's axis&quot; . . .
&gt;
&gt;According to whom?  I would love this to be true, as it is a recipe for a 
&gt;perpetual motion machine and a solution to all the world's energy 
&gt;problems; but alas, that damn nuisance 1st law of thermodynamics won't 
&gt;allow it... 
&gt;
&gt;Mike (and others), you are confusing deflection and torque.   You are 
&gt;quite correct that the longer the extension, the greater the angular 
&gt;deflection, but the torque will be uniform through-out.  
&gt;
&gt;Regards,
&gt;

 Tom . .  I assume I'm doing a poor job of explaining . . . 
we try again . . :-)

 Rather than perpetual motion, I'd like to cite the law of &quot;Conservation of
Energy&quot; . . . 

 The only energy being applied to the shaft is the torque wrench 
that reads say 50 ft-lbs . .

So if there is any angular deflection, it has to be using some of that
50 ft-lb as energy . . . 

Since you can't get more than you put in, less than 50 ft-lb will 
reach the nut . . .
