&lt;&lt; Has anyone ever made a cab divider? How would one do it? is
 cardboard good? or should i use some thinner wood?  Its a walk through,
 so I figured maybe someone did it in a walk through split.  tis why its
 on the vintage list.  Its for a 71.  So any input would be greatly
 appreciated! &gt;&gt;
Hi Isaiah,
Better to sew up some curtians instead!  We have these in our 1960 walk thru 
panel.  They work great, at a moments notice can be opened to allow excess 
heat to the rear, and allow you to still use the walk thru.
