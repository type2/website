Ok. Choke is working, I seem to have gotten it to stop running like a
racecar. But, its still backfiring, inside the manifold it seems (is'nt that
where it always does?) Is it possible I have plug wires crossed or would it
not even start that way? I set timing, as I figured that since the two
notches are 2.5 degrees apart, stands to reason that 4 marks are 10 degrees,
so hopefully thats right. (I have only a static timing light, but I'm
assuming thats ok). I'm off to go check manuals and such. Thanks for any
help.
