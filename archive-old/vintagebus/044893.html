Take a pill Nikki,  I was wrapped up in the middle of Dawn's fiasco last year 
and didn't know for months if I was going to get my money back or product.  
Fortunately, I received my product and what a fine pop-top it is.  Having 
someone ask about Dawns status before gambling with hundreds of dollars is no 
reason to get your panties in a bunch.
