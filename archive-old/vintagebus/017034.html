I think those are targeted at the Empi Cal Look crowd.  Those original 
empi wooden steering wheels fetch crazy dollars on ebay, though!  What's
funny is to see old mags with ads for them for like $20!

&gt; I just noticed that RMMW has wooden steering wheels.  Not sure if
&gt; they'll fit a bus, but they do have some potential.  Pricey, though,
&gt; particularly once you include the separately-listed adapter....
