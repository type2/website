Subject: !! URGENT News about NQ and his leaving work early Thursday
Date: Fri, 19 Jan 2001 10:29:57 -0800
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

The clue to this Mystery Message that NQ posted on Thursday:

He is reported to have been seen somewhere near sand and water.

I am working to get some photos in, but not sure if they will arrive.  Could
be another &quot;Bigfoot&quot; report, as I've heard that NQ is a pretty big guy.
Maybe the photos will be of Bigfoot himself?

Subject: [VB] Gotta leave for a short time.


Just wanted to let everyone know that a matter came up today and I had to
leave work early.  It necessitates that I leave town for a while so if you
email me, you can expect to hear back from me in about a week.  It's nothing
really serious so don't worry but it just means I won't be able replying to
you.  Hang in there gang...
