hi all,

I ma going to order mirrors for my 61 this week... and have come to this
point...

I like the round ones because they look way cool.  But, i wonder how well
you can see to the rear with em. I have a 61 and i plan to drive it a
lot.  It has the small rear window so the mirrors may well be an important
tool.

The elephant ears look like they might be better suited for seeing out of,
but they arent as cool looking... i think they started offering the
elepahnt ears 61 or earlier, so either one is correct...

any opinions from those who have used both/either as to usefulness when
driving?

peas,

Steve

p.s. one of my taillight glass pieces is cracked, and one of my rings has
lost its chrome... anyone have a spare of either they'd let go
reasonably?
