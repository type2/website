&lt;&lt; I had planned to convert the rear of my '59 single cab to big nut 
 redux box transaxle. So I'm now planning on installing this '67 beam 
 to the front.
 
 Before I do this, I'd like to go through it and do any replacing or 
 rebuilding needed.
  &gt;&gt;

any wiggly bits need replacing or adjusting.  tie rods, drag link, . do kings 
wiggle?   links?   how's the swing lever bushing?  steering damper okay?  you 
can change it now and not get grit in your eyes.  

yes, the 67 column fits fine .

on mirror, I don't know that there is an adjustment.
