Theres a thing called a spitznagel.
Like a slide hammer but works without making holes.
You can pull the dents up past level.
You can then use whats called a shrinking disc to put the metal back into its 
original shape.
Once you get good at it you can make the metal PERFECT, ready for paint with 
only a coat of primer and ZERO bondo.
Look in hemmings, theres a few places selling these shrinking discs.

&lt;&lt; &gt; I am beginning the bodywork on the nose of my '64 westy.  i knew there 
was
 &gt; some bondo there, but the more I work at it, the more I find.  Sigh.  It
 &gt; looks like i will need to replace the nose section.  Now the question,
 what
 &gt; is the best way to do this.
 
 That's like asking what is the best way to hit your thumb with a hammer.
 Best to try fixing the original with a hammer and dolly and a torch. Once
 you're all practiced out, either it will be allright or you can go on with
 the welding. &gt;&gt;

I saw Kyle doing some of this torching the bent metal, really neat the way 
the metal wanted to go back to it's original shape.   Works best on dents, 
not creases.   Supposedly applying a damp cloth to cool the metal after it 
goes back helps it &quot;set&quot;.
