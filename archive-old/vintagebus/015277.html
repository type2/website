Subject: Gauges in fresh air box

I did this on my 66 deluxe, it was one of the first things I did to get that 
hideaus black gauge panel off my dash. It worked out well and the flap still 
works fine. Not sure about the humidity or water up there affecting the 
gauges but that is really more dependant on where you live. I just snaked 
the wires up behind the passenger door weather stripping and then drilled 
and ran it up over(behind) the headliner. It was a pain to snake it through 
abut then again I'ma rookie and so experience may make a world difference. 
They look real nice there. Good luck.

Scott

I have a spare cover plate for my overhead fresh air box, and I was
thinking about putting some gauges up there (oil pressure, temp, maybe a
clock from a KG). Has anyone done this before? Is there enough room for
the flap to work properly? How hard is it to get wiring up there? Are
there any compelling reasons NOT to do this (vintage Nazis need not
respond)?
