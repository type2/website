No. Instead they have a threaded insert, that's what the grooves are, 
the threads. If you are going for the Vintage Nazi poles these aren't 
them. If you're going for the look and function of original poles with a 
few of today's technology used to make them, then these are the ones. A 
few people on the list have seen them, and at least 1 has bought a set 
from me. I made 10 sets, and have sold 7. For awhile I was using one set 
of originals on one side of my DD and a set of my repros on the other 
side. No one ever knew. It worked good for selling purposes too, as I 
could show the buyer *exactly* what they were getting.
