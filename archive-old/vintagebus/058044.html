Subject: Wood paneling 

One of my Club Veedub members has asked me this and I don't know what to
tell him.  Can anyone help me out??
&quot;The varnish is coming off my interior wood panels. Is there a product like
a stain that I can get to bring back the paneling? The inside of the sliding
door on my '78 van is an example of a place that needs work.&quot; 
Thanks in advance!
