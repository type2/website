Hello fellow bus fans,
Thanks to all who gave me advice on the swing lever bushings. On
closer inspection my link and king pin bushings don't look so hot
either so I pulled the beam and now I'm going to overhaul the lot.
Besides all the bushings, tie rods, shocks, a new steering dampener
and some new grease nipples, what else is there to do on the front
beam? Is there any maintainance I should perform on the torsion bars
and tubes? Those are still a bit of a mystery to me...
Thanks,
Joel
