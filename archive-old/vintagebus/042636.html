&gt; The IRS II kit allows your early Bus to remain at stock height.
yes,

i am aware of that... i stated (as you can read) that it was either
expensive or cheap with compromises.

i was refering to the bus boys irsII kit as the expensive option.
the kit is: $650.00
the cv joints required you list at: $354.80

right there we are at $1004.80

then you need thing inner CV joint flanges a type 1 or 3 transmission,
68-71 spring plates 68-71 rear axle bearing housings complete with brakes
etc.

too rich for my blood....

one can homebrew a bug irs kit much cheaper, but it has many limitations.
It can, however, be made to run at stock height with thing cv flanges
inboard and outboard, type4 cv's and custom axles. ( i think you need
thing springplates too... but im no expert... i read enough to decide i
like redux box suspensions...)

take care,

Steve

&gt; &gt; right for squat.  Generally the cheaper option requires you lower the bus.
&gt; &gt; Once the bus is lower you need to run low profile tires... then you loose
&gt; &gt; the high speed gearing advantage you just spent so much money to get...
&gt; &gt; kind of a catch 22.
