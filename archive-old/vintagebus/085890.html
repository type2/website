&gt; George,

&gt; Thanks for posting the pics! Great turn out. Were you one of the lucky
&gt; recipients of a gas card? I found a pic of myself and another with my bus.
&gt;
&gt; Movie was not all bad either. Too bad it was a bay not a split.

I tried to get all the buses, though I might have missed a couple of late
arrivals.

Somebody handed my wife a gas card while I was out taking pictures.  Wish
I'd won that $500 number, though!

Interesting movie, but a real VW bus pilot would have replaced the
clutch cable in 30 minutes and pulled the wire on the horn!

I'm still chuckling over the ending...

George
