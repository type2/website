Subject: Life Magazine ads

I have been looking for LIFE mag ~Special Holiday Issue~ 1959.

There is a cool illustrated ad of a 23 deluxe sunroof with a family inside.
I missed getting this one years ago when a buddy had the $6.00 for the whole
mag and I didn't. Just for fun I have been looking since. Not a big deal but
fun to look for~ just like the Popular Mechanics with the privy tent on the
front cover  that my buddy got for $0.50 and the May '72 Natl Geographic
with the tourist-photographer-nerd and hungry looking grizzly bear in front
of the white splittie.
