Subject: yet more on dual springs
Mime-Version: 1.0

Hi Folks - here's my hard earned 3 centses:

================
 From George Lyle:
 &gt;&gt;....
You only need enough closing force to cause the valve to follow the
closing side of the cam, plus a bit more to prevent bounce.  If you're
using a stock cam and rockers at normal RPM, then stock valve springs are
all you need.  Stronger/double springs will only increase wear and
friction.

OTOH, if you are using a cam with a high lift, steep profile, or are
running at high RPMS, then you will need stronger springs to keep the
lifter on the cam. ...... hot-rodders eschew this, opting for
the strongest springs available and living with the increased wear.&lt;&lt;
===============

 From me:
I'm on the third version of of my blueprinted, full flow, low compression 
stroker motor in my bus, now totaling over 160,000 miles since 1981.  I'd 
always thought that Gene Berg's strongly worded claim (still there in the 
latest catalog) that even stock motors in busses can float stock valve 
springs due to the low gearing in first and second was likely true; but 
bowed to Doug Bean's knowledge when we built the first one - we used 
shimmed, single hd springs (and even thick aluminum push rods, still 
available then) on Doug's p&amp;p'd stock size valve heads with an Engle 100 
and a Claude's 78 cast crank with thick walled 88's, sucking from a 
Holley/Weber two barrel.  We dropped an exhaust valve at 55,000 miles, 
coming home from an offroad race 30 miles outside of Twentynine Palms, 
CA.  Had it towed to the back of a Mexican restaurant, found someone to 
weld shut the nickle size hole in the top of the piston, bolted on a stock 
head and I put 15,000 more miles on it before teardown.

Next time we used 40 X 35 big valve heads and replaced the (now broken) 
cast crank with a 74 forged from Mance and a set of Kadrons.  Still single 
springs w/ chrome moly pushrods.  This one dropped an intake valve going 
onto the SF Bay Bridge one morning rush hour.

Doug died and the bus sat in my driveway until I had to do something before 
a move to AZ or lose it.  This rendition finally got GB dual springs on a 
set of GB stock dual ports w\ 3 angle valve job and a set of 1.25 
rockers.  Still an Engle 100, Kadrons, and shimmed to a ridiculous 6.3:1 CR 
(ridiculous until your fillup is gurgling from a rusty 5 gal can deep in 
Baja).  This one is still taking me the 50 miles roundtrip to work or cross 
country at will after 60,000.  Yes, I give up some HP to the springs.  But 
note that I used the same cam (w\ fresh lifters) from the second motor.  It 
starts right up in any weather, runs on any gas available and does cruise 
at 65-75 on the Interstate at no more than 220F indicated on the oil temp 
guage from the sump in summer's heat.

The clear moral to me is:  I _will use_ dual springs on the next version as 
well.  I'll Finally give Betsy (a '71 kombi) a fresh case and a set of 
Weber 40's but will happily keep compression way under 7:1.  Ditto for the 
upcoming 90.5 X 69 single port motor for the '61 pickup.  Berg actually 
said that he had not seen one case of engine failure from &quot;too much&quot; spring 
pressure.  I now believe him.  Anyone interested in more details on low 
compressison bus motor design is welcome to ask me offlist as I can't 
really keep up with the digests.
