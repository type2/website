P&amp;C,

I learned to drive in my bus too. Sometimes on the hills of San Francisco!! 
There was a skit by I think Bill Cosby maybe someone else, about driving in 
San Francisco and the joke was that you didn't want to  have to stop for a 
light on a hill unless you were at the front of the line. The reason was 
that you could then hook your front wheels over edge of the top of the hill 
onto the flat intersection so that you would not roll backwards as you 
desperately clutched back into motion.

On a learner's permit I drove several times from our home down the peninsula 
to Lake Tahoe with my Dad asleep in the front seat and the rest of the 
family in the back at night. Lots of 20mph in second gear going up those 
Sierra mountains.

Chris

 Thanks for sharing that is REALLY net.
 If Philip could fine the 1960 bug that he got to drive in off the lot
 also he was 13, and some of he first driving trials, the hand brake was
 close for his dad.
