Mike - I pressure washed everything inside of the bus minus the clock and
the headliner.  There is so much rust in the floor that I didn't have to
worry about drainage.  The radio and speedo work fine and neither them nor
the fuel guage showed any signs of water penetration.  I would be cautious
about turning on a radio while there is water still inside and keep in mind
that the ash tray doesn't have a drain hole.
