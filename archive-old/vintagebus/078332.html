&gt;&gt; Have you or anyone ever tried Muir's suggestion for oil-soaked brake

&gt;Ya, BTDT, cheaper than brake cleaner.

Cool.  It sounded good but I wasn't sure.  Maybe I'll try it the next
time an oily friction surface presents itself.

&gt; I guess for everything there is a time and a place,

This has probably been done better, but now I have stuff in my head
like:

A time for splits, a time for bays
A time for rust, a time for paint
A time to lower, a time to raise
A time for six, a time for twelve
To everything, turn, turn, turn...

&gt;do not oil your clutch every tuneup.

I may have just solved my hill-climbing problems...
