I believe that the SO 69 interior is the Westy interior that we are used to 
seeing in US busses.I have some of that floor plywood, but it is at home, and 
I am not.I recently parted out a 68 Dormobile which was relatively complete, 
and I drive a 66 Dormobile.I may actually have an SO 69 manual at home, I'll 
have to look.      Ed
