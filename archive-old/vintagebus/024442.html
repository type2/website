Subject: Pop-top wanted for '66

Hi,

I'm looking for an original Westy poptop for my '66 hardtop westy.

If anyone has a line on one I'd appreciate it.  Condition of canvas not
important,
but hopefully fairly complete hardware-wise.

I'm located in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada, which is near the NY border (in
case it has to
be shipped some distance).

Thanks for any leads,
...Markus
