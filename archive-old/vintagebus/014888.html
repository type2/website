Heh!
Well, finally!
Just maybe a really nice older bus with TONS of truly
rarest of the rare items on it with real original (not
repopped) mechanicals just finally *might* be worth
more than a half assed deluxe.
Just because a POS has holes in the roof doesn't
automatically mean that it is money in the bank.

A thorough quality true restoration such as those that
have come out of Transporter Restorations and original
mint condition buses is the way to go. Starting with a
nice base and doing it right will always be the
ticket.

What is that old saying about trying to polish
&quot;yogurt&quot;. Rub and rub and all you have is &quot;yogurt&quot;.
Ya can't polish a turd...

Back to basics folks: Buy a bus because you like it
and wanna drive it. I like my '54. =)
