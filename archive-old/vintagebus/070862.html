Subject: RE: [VB] Bus buying scams

Is it at all a good idea to take their checks and deposit them, so that the
fruad is actually commited by them and gives the FBI more ammo? Of course,
send them nothing in return..

....
Both of those sound like scams.  In fact, they sound identical to emails I
have seen.  I have hundreds of these scam emails.

For international sales, you should accept cash via Western Union or via
bank wire transfer only.

Obviously, anything that involves you sending them money is a scam.  Any
situation where they want to send you more than the sales price of the car,
no matter what the reason, is a scam.
