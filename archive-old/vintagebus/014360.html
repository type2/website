I have a well-earned distrust of Chief/Kragen/AutoZone &quot;rebuilt&quot;
parts such as generators and starters.  Sure, they offer a lifetime
warranty, but how many times do you really want to pull that muther
out?  The last time I bought a Kragen generator, I got the thing
home, took one look at it, and took it right back.  The commutator
was in such crappy condition, and had been oversprayed black, that
I knew this thing wasn't going to last.  I took it right back and
paid - gladly - twice as much for a real Bosch unit from the VWFLAPS.
