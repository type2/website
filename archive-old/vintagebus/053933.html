Subject: Re: [VB] fuel pump placement

I've never heard that or any other advice on 'em. Seems if it's going in a =
'Merican car you'd have more of an effect placing it in the engine =
compartment vs. near the tank. We don't have that problem on T2s.=20
FWIW, the PO put the Electric fuel pump on the bulkhead in front of the =
engine of my '63 DC making it real tough to work on. It'll be moved to an =
easier reach next time the engine's out.=20

I'll make a guess... less hose to collapse in the event of negative =
atmospheres (vacuum)? In home brewing we restrict the output of a pump to =
regulate flow, never the input. Less hose =3D less drag.=20

i have read that the closer you can place the
electrick fuel pump to the gas tank the better? what
is the reasoning behind this?
