Subject: Re:  [VB]size Correct DOOR BUMPERS???
To: rdavis_at_sbch_dot_org, vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com


This door bumper thread reminded me of a list question.  The repop bumpers 
are larger than the originals.  Anyone know of a source for the smaller, 
correct, original style door bumpers?

the repop are the mid 65 through 67 style.   
they were smaller mid 54 through mid 65
they were even smaller mid 54 and earlier and were located differently.
