Subject: Re: [VB] Front end questions

The 8mm square headed screw.  This is often known to be rusted to sh&amp;t.  I 
hope you have been using penetrating oil daily for the last couple weeks, 
having seen how things rust in the UK., it's even worse than here in WA 
state.   The thing is, you might break it off, and have to drill it out, 
while the collar is a softer metal and you don't want to mess it up.   I know 
the earlier (61 type) collars are available repro, but I don't know about the 
later collars.    Sometimes I use a propane torch and alternate with a squirt 
bottle of water to shock the rust loose, then more penetrating oil.   

I have found  that you can mash a 12 point 10mm socket on there, use a short 
extension, and it usually works.  If you can find a 8mm square socket you're 
stylin.

the square head used to have a wire through it, to wrap around the shift rod 
and keep it from undoing on its own, check to make sur ethe wire's gone 
before undoing the set screw.
Always grease liberally when assembling.

 On the subject of removing the beam, the only part I have left to do is
 removing the front shift rod.  From postings I remember in the past I
 believe this can be quite a pain.  I have plus gassed the area several times
 in the hope of freeing it up a bit.  Now in the manual it says to remove the
 screw.  Is this the square headed bolt - I couldn't see any slot for a screw
 driver.  Should I use a pair of mole grips on this?
 
 Thanks
