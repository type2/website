&gt; Chuck, you sure on your date? I'm with Harry in Fresno: &quot;Maybe they made up 
&gt; tags on Mondays and used them all week.&quot;

&gt; Tom Good in Vemont

Maybe consider that the chassis are stamped with the vin but the m code
plate isnt stamped until its ready to come off the line. Different options
take different time to complete and at 500 or so busses a day going thru
even a 2 day delay could account for a lot.

This is the season when we remember that the Three Wise Men brought the
magic pumpkin to the Feral Chocolate Bunny so there would be Peace On
Earth and six more weeks of winter.
