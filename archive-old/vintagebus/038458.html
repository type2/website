I recommend that anyone considering electric pumps get the Gene Berg
catalog.  You will see a lot of people tear down Berg (like Hoover) but I
think a lot of what he says is based on his own testing.  I've done a lot of
research and I think on this topic that Berg knew what he was talking about.

Anyway -- he says he has run the STOCK fuel pumps on the largest of dual
carbs.  If you insist on Electric, he also has some recommendations (for
racers) to use the Holley red/blue if you want to go electric.  (Tom
Wilson's book has info on these too I believe).

Although Berg doesn't get into this (in what I have read), my own research
suggests:  isn't one of the _huge advantages_ of the stock pump is that it
is variable and tied to RPM.  As the engine cranks faster so does the pump
rod...  Think about it, even if you go to 8,000 RPM (which Berg does say the
stock pump can do)... it is pumping more fuel.  Plus at lower RPM it has
lower pressure...  In many ways, an electric isn't even as good as the
stock!  Yes, even the facet.

My $0.02.  I ultimately decided to go with the stock pump on my Dual
Kadrons.  (abet a new Alternator style one from Gene Berg -- which is just a
Mexico one they sell.  Make sure you get a new rod and the proper 99mm
size.)

Subject: fuel pump

if anybody out there is going to run an electric fuel pump be sure to buy
the
one from cb performance.its a rotory fuel pump,and its not as loud as the
faucet style fuel pumps are.the pump from cb works good and it only puts out
3
or 3.5 psi.you can get it with different psi.but fot the stock carb all you
need is 3 psi.
