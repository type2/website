Subject: Bus rims?

Hello oh list of knowledge,

    I would like to put some stock rims on my 65.  Right now it has 15
in beetle rims on it and I'm tired of getting thrown all over the road
with those tiny tires (165r1585s)
    My local vw yard has pleny of 14&quot; bus rims, but very few 15&quot;.  I
belive 14's were stock for my year, but I'm not positive.  I've also
heard it's hard to find tires for the 15's.
    Does anybody have some spare rims they would be willing to part
with?  I can supply 5 beetle rims to anyone who needs them.  My local
guy wants $20 bucks a pop for them, is that good, bad, or average?
    Any help is appreciated.
Thanks,
Jon
