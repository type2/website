On 10/5/99 8:10 PM, bighouse_at_type2_dot_com thus spake:

&gt;I was playing with the Faq-O-Matic, courtesy of Brother Hintz, which isn't
&gt;linked to the home page yet because I forgot:
&gt;
&gt;	http://www.type2_dot_com/fom-serve/cache/1.html
&gt;
&gt;And I was looking at the Distributors section, which is cloned from the
&gt;type2 Library:
&gt;
&gt;	http://www.type2_dot_com/fom-serve/cache/44.html
&gt;
&gt;So I added &quot;Timing the Bosch 009&quot;, you'll see it at the bottom. However, it
&gt;turns out that the FOM removes all redundant white space her HTML specs, so
&gt;it looks awful. Here it is again corrected:

FYI-To add white space to an entry simply double return, the FOM will 
strip one cr but not the 2nd. If you submit an entry and want to edit it, 
click on the &quot;appearance&quot; link at the bottom of the page, and choose 
&quot;show expert&quot; editing commands. Assuming you are the person that created 
the entry in question, you will be allowed to edit it.

If all else fails, the FOM submits every change to me (as the moderator), 
and I'll check and fix as necessary-I just fixed Brother Hoop's entry...  
;-) It's also possible to put your info in as untranslated html, should 
you really want to...


Peace,
