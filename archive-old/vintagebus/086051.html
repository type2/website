Subject: Gas tank retrofit?

Ok, So I got a 68-72 gas tank, got it installed in my bus and it doesn't seem to sit down as I thought it should even with the straps tight. There is a gap about a half inch underneath the tank and it wouldn't be a problem if it didn't make the flange for the filler neck too high, high enough to make the neck interfere with part of the body. Does anybody have similar experiences and a subsequent fix to the problem? I really want to have this bus ready for Everybus. Thanks and yes I have checked out the article on the VB website but it is very vague.
