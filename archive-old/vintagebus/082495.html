Subject: Re: Big Nut to Freeway Flyer

i appreciate all the responses, but am a bit more confused now.

will my stock 1500sp be too small to push a freeway flier? Ohio is FLAT 
aside from the occasional grade. what about some dual carbs for a bit more 
juice :-)

in my previous '66 that the big nut came out of, i dont remember being able 
to cruise at 65 without pushing past 4000rpm. and this was on stock sized 
tires.

thanks again,
Bob
