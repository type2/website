I don't know if their on the web but those numbers are all part of DIN 
72552 (Bosch sells a book with them all in it)

30=Input from battery (+) terminal
56=Headlamp
57a=parking lamp 57L=parking lamp Left 57R=parking lamp Right
58= Side-marker lamps, tail lamps, license lamps &amp; instrument lamps
58b= I haven't got a clue as my Bosch automotive handbook doesn't list it 
(I would guess one of the above)

&gt;  Is there someplace on the
&gt;net I can find out the &quot;standard&quot; numbering scheme for
&gt;electrical components?  I am guessing that, for
&gt;example, the headlight switch on my 66 bus doesn't
&gt;have the numbers 30, 56, 57, 58, and 58b randomly.
&gt;There must be someplace that dictates a 30 terminal to
&gt;be something like &quot;fused power&quot; and 58 to be power
&gt;output or something.  Any ideas?  Thanks!
