Thom,
I believe that it's CopyMax (at the OfficeMax stores) that does the setting and binding, for a few
dollars.  (I think that's right... it may be Kinko's, or both???)  Anyways, you can get it done
there, for a nominal fee.  With that size book, you're probably looking at $7-8 a piece, if you
had enough made.  They also do the ring binder stuff, which would make more since than book
binding, anyways!

I would be happy to make a &quot;donation&quot; to the Thom Fitzpatrick re-imbursement association, say, in
the amount of $20 dollars or ?? and receive a &quot;free&quot; bound book, for your appreciation of my
donation!! ...hint, hint!

&gt; I recently purchased a 1954 (8/53) bus parts book, and I'd like to make
&gt; some copies.  Does anyone have suggestion on how to best accomplish 
&gt; this?  As it is, I'm almost done scanning it, my little contribution
&gt; to the Obsolete Air-Cooled Documentation Project.  A few individuals
&gt; have expressed interest in having a copy of their own, and I have
&gt; this fantasy that somehow selling a few copies would help defray not
&gt; only the cost of the duplication, but partially offset the cost of
&gt; the book itself.
