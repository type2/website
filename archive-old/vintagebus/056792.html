&gt; Does the reference &quot; LJ/REG/180/6/25001-8 (or 3 )&quot; speaks to anyone as a 6 
&gt; Volt generator part number ?

Hi Bertrand,
Not sure what &quot;LJ/REG&quot; means, but &quot;/180&quot; = 180 Watts.  /6 =6 volts.  /25001-8 
(or 3) means nothing to us either, but it is a probably a L3 not an 8.  By 
the parts book which is also online in &quot;Obsolete Aircooled Documents&quot; webpage 
this is a 113 903 021 B used from engine 5 000 001 up to 8 209 812 and was 
superseded by 111 903 021 H.
