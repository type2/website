The front is very obviously bent, no guesses there.

How about for rear gates?  The rear hoop hit the gate, and kinked
it outward about 1 1/2&quot; or so.

&gt; Fair market replacement value for hoops are $500.  You will need a full
&gt; replacement set as the front was most likely bent as well, although it may
&gt; not be obvious until you try to replace just the rear.

&gt; Feel free to use this email as an estimate for your insurance.
