&gt;And, oh yeh, what's a &quot;non-kock price&quot;?
&gt;

 he said :&quot; non-koch price&quot; not kock....meaning &quot;koch's&quot;- the company that
restores steering wheels and charges a fortune. I bought a 58 ghia wheel
&gt;from them (450 bucks!!!) and when I got it , it had paint runs..._dot_called
them and sent it back and they said &quot;you cant expect it to be perfect, were
only human&quot;....jeez guess I was expecting too much for only $450?
