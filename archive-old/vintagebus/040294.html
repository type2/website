I need the exhuast bracket that attaches to the bumper/bumper mount on a
1966 Deluxe split, PO removed it to install an extractor and bugpack,
currently leaking..Already have a nice German exhuast to mount, thanks to
Bus depot. Will the tailpipe stay on/up with out this temporarily? Or should
I wait until I get one to install?

What paint is recommended over the grey paint that the muffler came with?
Concerned with longevity, and correctness to some degree.
Also, pop outs. Mine are moderately pitted, swayed away from ISP repos due
to recent threads, so I am searching for either more restorable OEs , NOSes,
or reassurance that filler is ok here by tested experience. Also, I saw
stainless screws for reassembly, but don't remember where, any leads?

The mail order ebay (yes, I AM stupid) 66 is underway. The carb was replaced
with a 34PICT, and shes running now. Hard to tune right due to exhaust leak,
but no bad flat spot with the 009 right now. Fuel lines all replaced, and
filter changed to steel, instead of the bus frying plastic POS that was
there to begin with, couldn't believe there were no clamps!, none! Still
have to do the under bus line, but waiting to burn some gas first, as I have
a 1/2 tank. I put the metal can filter in the inlet side to the fuel pump,
mounted vertically left of the distrib, with zip ties to 'cable' the two
lines together where they run parallel to the pump, trying to avoid any
possible contact with anything under all conditions. Metal line through tin
area seems to be missing the grommet too, so going to fab something up to
get rid of that scary thought. At least she moves, encouragement to keep
going. Next will be manifold boots (please tell me I can do them with
everything in place, looks possible..
