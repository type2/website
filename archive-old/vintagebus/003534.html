Hi All
I looked into having this done about 8-10 years ago.  I found a contract
tent manufacturer who would manufacture,ship,and store them!  However, they
were unable to come close enough to a functional repro.  Also, they would
have been about $600 then.  I decided that the hassle was too much for an
expensive (at the time) &quot;incorrect&quot; repro.

The funniest part of the story was my wife calling Westfalia.  It took her a
week to get an English speaking person.  She was then told go for it, they
would not be concerned about patent stuff!
