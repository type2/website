&lt;&lt; My red light is on, the generator light to be specific.  I smelled
something
 sorta burning while driving on the freeway.  Then my red light came on.  I
 stopped, opened the rear lid and found little pieces of cloth type thread
 stuff lying around the engine that should be in the generator where the
 windings are.  I know this because I just had the same problem a month ago,
 funny smell, red light, cloth type thread lying around the engine bay.....
 The generator is a rebuilt one that I installed a month ago.  Saturday night
 when driving home my headlights were getting brighter the faster I drove.
 This worried me, but I thought that since the generator is new it must be
 the regulator.  So I put a new regulator in, polarized and all, but that
 hasn't eliminated the red light. &gt;&gt;
Hi Jim,
Did you replace the regulator at the same time you replaced the first
generator.  It could be that your regulator was bad, burned out the first
generator and when you installed the second did the same all over again!  Eric
