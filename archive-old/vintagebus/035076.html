&lt;&lt; Again, if memory serves correctly we used this later front shift rod 
bushing 
 on our 1960 without problem.  Could be that DPO had the later metal bracket 
 shift guide piece installed and that might let the later bushing work with 
 the earlier shift rod.

 &lt;&lt; the rear two bushings are the badminton birdies, and they were changed at 
 chassis 835 088.  the older version are smooth on the outside, the newer 
 version have a ridge-&gt;&gt;
 If we are figuring that chassi # out correctly that change should have 
 occured about the third or fourth month of 1962 model year.  If memory 
serves 
 correctly we used the ridged rear shift rod bushings from WW on our 1960 
 panel camper without any problems so far.  The only thing we had to do was 
to 
 carefully peel open these bushings and carve out the casting flash around 
 locking tab that locks these bushings to thier position on the rear shift 
rod.

that is good to know!!!! - that you can use the later birdies with the 
earlier buses

===============
 &lt;&lt;the rear shift rod was changed at that time and no they are not 
 interchangable. &gt;&gt;
 Think Clara means that only the rear shift rod is not interchangable.

right- you can not use a later rear shift rod on your early rear shift rod 
bus.  
sorry if I wasn't clear on which piece I was talking about.
