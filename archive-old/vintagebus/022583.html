Maybe it's like the farm leauges; if you get &quot;discovered&quot; at VW Trends, you
could some day write for Cosmo or GQ, or, if you're really lucky, Consumer
Reports!

&gt;still holds true or not I couldn't say.  As has been mentioned, these 
&gt;magazines are something like a few Phoenix radio stations:  revolving doors 
&gt;for anyone and everyone to pass through.
