There is no way in hell Bob can be married.  Any of you that are married know
that the 50/50 rule is the best you'll ever get.  Between 12 hours a day of
work, fixing the house, and taking the kid to something time is at a premium.
If I get one day a week to myself to wrench on the beast, I thank my lucky
stars!  Single people have no idea how much FREE time they have.   Enjoy it
while you have it.

&gt; It's all fair in love and VW's&quot;

&gt; if that was the case i would be broke! you would finish your bus in half the
&gt; time if it wasn't for this... not really FAIR, more LOVE on your part.
&gt; sounds like you r wife is a little teeny bit jealous. she should be just as
&gt; excited as your are about your VWs. she's gonna love when you need that new
&gt; GEX motor :)
