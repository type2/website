Subject: Re: Protecting a new front emblem??

&gt;I bought a brand new emblem for my '66 DeLuxe (Chrome) from Wolfsburg West
in May 98....now the emblem is covered in surface rust, and the chrome
plating is flaking off :-(  I called WW and they're going to refund the
$100, but refuse to replace due to the fact I live on the coast of Florida.
I ordered another emblem from Kustom1 for $80 and it arrived today. Before I
install, I would like to protect this emblem so this problem doesn't occur
again.  I thought about using a high-gloss clear coat, but I'm worried that
this might ruin the emblem's sheen or peel off???  I really don't have the
time or $$$ to spend having extra layers of chrome added locally (a friend's
suggestion).  What should I do?  Thanks for your help..
&gt;


I have often wondered this same thing, but have never talked to a plater
about it. I do know, from discussion with a plater, that even good chrome is
not rust proof. They recommend a good quality car wax on a regular basis to
prevent rust formation and pitting. Also, seal the back side with a high
quality paint and maybe even and undercoating over that.
