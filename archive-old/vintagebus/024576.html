Subject: yellow light

Got my bus back from the mechanic today. I could never get it running so 
I had it towed and Fred fixed it. Sort of. He told me it ran good but 
needed a muffler real badly. So I paid and drove it home. The yellow 
light would not stay off. According to Muir, this is oil, right?? I only 
drove it a few blocks. It sounds like hell but I dont know yet how much 
of that is muffler.

It was great to finally drive it, even if it wasn't a successful test 
drive. It was rolling under its own power and the clutch and brakes work. 
The brakes seem a bit weak but I have nothing to compare it against. I 
havent driven a bus in over 20 years.

At any rate, it looks like I have my hands full. Looks like the spare 
engine may be going back in the thing after all.
