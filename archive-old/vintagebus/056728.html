  Ladies and Gentlemen, Boys and Girls, step right up to see the very
  first commercially produced 1/64 scale VW pickup. This bus is loaded
  with wonderful features. Beautiful Velvet Green color, outstanding
  detail level. Includes chrome Volkswagen script on the back and VW =
logo on the front and are you
  all ready for this!!! Our own Kokopeli logo directly above the bumper.
  That's right folks working from the photos Terry Wolfe took of my bus =
the
  designers included our Koko magnet on the back of the bus. I doubt =
there
  is another bus club that has as cool a toy as this. Keep watching the
  stores folks. You just gotta have your own Buskatier logoed Johnny
  Lightning bus.  http://204.26.80.78:8084/scweb/johnny.html
  The page also includes the original images the toy was designed from.
  Dock2.jpg was used for the card inserted into the blisterpack. It was
  flipped over and the background removed.
