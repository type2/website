Subject: Hello, new bus owner

Hello everyone,

I just bought my first bus (1966 21 window) in January and I'm happy as a 
clam.  I've been following the list for the past few weeks and I've been 
blown away at how friendly and helpful everyone is.  Cheers to type2_dot_com for 
setting up this forum for so many excellent and knowledgeable people to 
communicate.

I have a fair amount of restoration work to accomplish so I'll probably be 
bothering ya'll alot.

My current problem is that the bus wont start.  (It will push start fine).  
When I turn the key over the engine does a sluggish half attempt at 
starting.  Battery is fully charged and the cables are all good (I've tested 
the voltage from the battery to the solenoid and that looked great).  I 
hooked a jumper up to bypass the solenoid (err a screwdriver ;) and the 
starter whirred to life.  I've taken the starter out (not as easy as I 
thought it would be) and here is where I'm at.

The PO said the old starter (6 volt) died (didn't explain much)and so he 
went out and bought a 12 volt starter (the bus has been converted to 12 volt 
but I can't tell how thorough of a job was done [wipers go so fast they must 
still be 6 volt + speedometer dosen't work but I'm not sure if that would be 
effected]).  I'm 99% positive that the flywheel is still the smaller 6volt 
size but the PO said the rebuilt 12v starter he bought was designed for a 6v 
flywheel.  Have any of you heard of this?  I've heard that a bushing needs 
to be changed in the tranny for this to work.  My current thinking is to try 
a new solenoid on the supposedly &quot;new&quot; rebuilt 12v starter.  Sorry if my 
questions seem a bit stuipid, I'm very new with busses and automechanics in 
general.  I have a Bently and the Idiots guide but I was wondering if any of 
ya'll know of a hint or trick I'm missing before I go waste my $.
