Subject: Re: [VB] Re: ordering vw part from US to Canada

Been there, done that, ship both ways all the time, send it usps or canada
post and mark it antique auto parts should avoid both duty and tax. Not as
expensive as some ebay'ers would have you believe. Stuff like brochure's
never costs more than $1.85 us. Don't; however mark it 'educational
material' will definitely be opened by customs who then will tax you to
justify their existence ask me how I know. Or do what I do, use it to
justify a trip to the sun ; )

&gt;
&gt; First and last comment on this thread.
&gt;
&gt; A friend of mine was involved in an industry that made extensive use of
&gt; shipping and he commented that East-West shipping has always been worse
than
&gt; North-South shipping all things being equal.  Something to do with traffic
&gt; and volume etc.  Needless to say I after comparing I generally order to
use
&gt; North-South shipping rather than the alternative when parts quality is the
&gt; same provider regardless.  I do order from Canada...
&gt;
&gt; Bus content: Got my front bumper, very nice one from CMeanly in BC,
Canada.
&gt; Met him on his cruise South... nice guy.

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;&lt;&lt;I recently canceled an order from CB perfomance because shipping is too
&gt; &gt;high, and few of my friends just order stuff from RMMotorworks and were
&gt; &gt;shocked at the shipping price, even if they choose the Ground shipping,
RMM
&gt; &gt;factured the high rate shipping....
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Thats why i usually choose Ebay, its easier to accomodate with the buyer
on
&gt; &gt;the shipping way...
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;I recently bought someting from BUGCITY.COM and now UPS called me to pay
&gt; &gt;for
&gt; &gt;custom...arrggg .. i hate UPS !!
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Please let us choose who we want to ship... !!!&gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Mike don't rag too much on our US companies.  It's a bit of a pain to
ship
&gt; &gt;to
&gt; &gt;Canada and the taxes and fees are charged on your end.  Call up your
&gt; &gt;government officials and complain.  The free trade agreement is for items
&gt; &gt;manufactured in Canada or the US, and doesn't apply to parts made
&gt; &gt;elsewhere.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;I try to send most orders to Canada by USPS, but those shipments can't be
&gt; &gt;tracked.  The post office says 7 days, when It really may take 4 weeks.
If
&gt; &gt;you are in a hurry for the item, UPS may be your only choice.  The postal
&gt; &gt;system is more expensive than UPS Standard service. USPS will not ship
&gt; &gt;large
&gt; &gt;items we sell like our bike racks and awnings.
