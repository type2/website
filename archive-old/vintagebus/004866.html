I was in an antique store this weekend and spied a VW bus in the matchbox
cars. It is a single cab flat bed with a working plastic elevator scaffold
looking thing with a rotating top platform. It pulls up to about 2 times the
normal height. I thought is was remarkable that the plastic part was there
unbroken. It says Husky and made in Great Britain on the bottom. Anyone know
how old it probably is? Anyone seen one?
