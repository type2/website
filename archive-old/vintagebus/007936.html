Tonight I went and sandblasted my rear apron (it was a smattering of white
and black spray paint topped with dried grease) and the headlight buckets.
The buckets had water sitting in them in the past and the primer had peeled.
Everything cleaned up really nice and is ready for some POR15.  One thing I
must say - the areas on the rear apron that had cheap spray paint on them
not only look nice but were protected.  It appears that even a cheap can of
spray paint can help deter rust and act as a preservative granted that it's
not put in a place that is exposed to abrasion and such.  I guess kind of
have newfound sense of respect for the rattle can.
