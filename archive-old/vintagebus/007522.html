never ending quest......well, I know that enough has been said on this
subject but let's do it all over again..... I don't have much rust on my
Bus, just surface in a couple of spots with minor penetration in the cab and
cargo floors but when I looked underneath the bus, the entire underbody has
gotten rusty in an instant when I brought it home. It's not rusty rusty rust
but just slight surface covering.... I was thinking about covering the
entire underbody with POR-15 but how to prep the surface?? I've got a guy
that does sand blasting.... he tells me to blast it with plastic........ any
thoughts? anybody done that? We here in the Midwest (Chicago) don't have too
many choices....

(((My wife tells me that I should go into business of restoring air-cooled
VW's...)))

Thanks,
