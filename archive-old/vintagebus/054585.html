It seems that Britt used his fine skills of persuasion and &quot;found a
ride&quot; to
California.  I received an email form his daughter around 3PM today and she
said he is fine.

Thanks to anyone who may have helped out. I am sure we'll get an update on
the situation soon.

Looks like Britt's Karma account is still running strong.  For those
that do
not know Britt, he has to be the single most decent and kind-hearted VW
Lover I have ever met.

Thanks for my new engine(s) Britt!
