Nick writ:
&gt; well the motor will be broke in after the drive to sacto in 2 weeks but
after i need to re-torque the heads right? so needing to do this do i have
to pull the motor and remove the tin? &lt;

The only way I know of to properly do it is to remove the motor and take the
tin off.  

The nuts should be torqued to 23 ft/lbs.
