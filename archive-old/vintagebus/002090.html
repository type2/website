Ok, Here is a serious Ignorant New Guy question...
I have a 67 Westy.  It is just sitting in the garage until I can get it on
the road, so I haven't had an opportunity to play with all of its features.
Is the refrigerator actually a powered refrigerator is it just an upright
cooler?  If so, is it powered by the engine or only when a plug is in the
side of the bus?  Same question goes for the interior outlets.
Thanks,
Mike
