Hey All,

I gonna get my bus aligned on lunch today.  Changed the right tie-rod last 
night w/ a fully adjustable one.  The guy said he would align it to the rear 
wheels.  Is there anything I should discuss w/ the mechanic to make sure the 
job is done right?  My steering box seems fine w/ the steering wheel in 
pretty much the right location.  Just wondering if its a good idea to make 
sure the steering box is properly adjusted before paying for an alignment 
job.

Thanks,

Eric
