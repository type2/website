Subject: Kill copyright/web-geek thread?

Folks, can we kill this discussion of who rips off images, how to rip them off, how to delude yourself into thinking you won't be ripped off, etc.?  Yes, you're talking 
about images of busses, but otherwise the content is vintagebus-free, isn't it?  I mean, are discussion of xerography topical?

Sorry, I just deal with this stuff at work all the time and would like to see this list stay on topic.  Let's hear more about jealousy windows, for example!  My 
pseudowesty has, instead, those envy-type windows because someone was (naturally) hoarding the jealousy windows that year.  The mfr tried to obtain a set of 
covetousness windows but they were on back order.
