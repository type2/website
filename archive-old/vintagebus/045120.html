&gt;can anyone recomend a good alternative other than the Idiot's Guide? I found
the 
&gt;Idiot's book useful but not nearly specific bus enough.   
&gt;hope you can help 

There's a manual that came out of England in a series published by Kenneth
Ball
called VW Transporter 1954-67. It's long out of print, but you might be able
to find
one if you run a search on Bibliofind_dot_com     Also, there was an early manual
out 
of LA from Clymer Publications, also long gone, but worth looking for.
