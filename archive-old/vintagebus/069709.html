 I know earlier busses and trucks have different rear bumpers but I was
 recently asked whether or not the mid 60's line up had different bumpers
 and I couldn't answer the question with certainty. so I post it up to
 the masses for judgement.
  &gt;&gt;
the stamped bumper ear had a different truck than bus bumper

for the sturdy bumpers, there was a diff truck bumper until partway through 
the 1960 model year . As of 5th Jan 1960 at VIN 554 147  the trucks and buses 
used the same bumper.
