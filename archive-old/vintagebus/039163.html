Greetings list.

A while back (couple months) there was a thread about the &quot;Hoover Bit&quot;
being reproduced. This is a small part of the cooling tin and there was
a post about how important it is to the cooling sytem working
efficiently. Two simple questions: 1 how many of these are there per
engine? 2 where does it / they go?

Thanks

Michael '61 doublecab: finally home and being re assembled at the speed
of desperation.
