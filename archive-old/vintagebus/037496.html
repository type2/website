Subject: engine stand?
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

I've been thinking about getting an engine stand lately.  I saw an engine 
bolted to one at the classic.  From what I could tell it had the loaf tranny 
bell housing bolted to it and the engine bolted to that.

I didnt see any actual engine stands for sale other than the little roll 
around dollies.  While checking out your favorite auction site and mine, I 
came across this:

http://cgi.ebay_dot_com/ebaymotors/aw-cgi/ebayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&amp;item=351265032&amp;r=
0&amp;t=0

It's a standard engine stand, but adjustable in many ways.  If I were to 
acquire something like this.  Could I conceivably adjust the arms to fit the 
bellhousing, bolt the bellhousing to the stand and then, when ready, bolt the 
engine to the bellhousing?

Am i crazy or right on track?
