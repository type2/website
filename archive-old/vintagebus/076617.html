Subject: Re: [VB] Re: &amp; my 65 Re: [VB] Another Lazy Mechanic

Me too. I had a 60 in 1965 van before there were hippies. I used it to sleep
over at the beach when I went surfing at Malibu. I went to Filmore and saw
Big Brother before anyone knew who Janis Joplin was. I stopped driving buses
because everyone else was driving them. Now I have returned and am feeling
quite at home.
Peace.
&gt; Anyhow .. I don't really mind the hippie comments.  But I do get annoyed
at
&gt; how little attention they pay to detail .. They are Not John Lennon
&gt; Glasses - and they are NOT Janis Joplin glasses .. and it is a bus .. not
a
&gt; van .. and what sort of nut case would buy their glasses to match their
&quot;VAN
&gt; .. &quot;
&gt;
&gt; Peace, Diane
