Subject: Putting my safaris back in
To: VintageBus_at_type2_dot_com

Well, since theres not much mechanical to tinker with on the 67 I decided to 
actually fix my safaris.  A while back I posted about the frames breaking.  
Contacted CE and they sent me a new set of frames out very quickly.  Anyways, 
they didnt want the broken ones back so that's cool. I sold the broken broken 
frames to a buddy for $50 and hes giving me his UN-broken Wolfgang safaris in 
the deal too.  I have no use for them but oh well.

I went to the paint store today, Arizona Automotive Paint &amp; Supply, and 
picked me up a quart of PPG Delstrar Acrylic Enamel L87 and had them mix it 
into 2 aeresol cans at $34.64.  So it looks like I will be able to use the 
safaris again.  Wuppee.  Now I can at least THINK im cool on the way up when 
im surrounded by Ronnie, VWHoward and the guys ;)
