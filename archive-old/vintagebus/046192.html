Home already!?
Hey, I was curious......
My 20- engine case has a screw hole where the later oil filler attaches, does 
that mean it needs the screw on style? Or did someone drill a hole? or??????
Hmmmm.........

What color is &quot;Grund&quot;?


Side note: M-code 30 is &quot;delivered in primer&quot;


Is it a slang of Gray, i.e. gray primer?


Thanks,
