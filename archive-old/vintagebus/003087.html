I would like to think most of us are on the up and up on this list but it
only takes on bad apple to spoil things. That's just my two cents!


PS: I was just looking at the bus registry on Thom's site and with all the
entry's he has my bus looks like it is one of the last 67 deluxes made (67
July). I was just curious if some one hade one even closer to the end of the
production year. I think they made splits only two more weeks after mine was
made.

I will sit back and listen again! ;-)
