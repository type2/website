Subject: Stuck Door
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

I have a 65 Bus with a drivers door that is stuck closed...the latch will not 
release, the button pushes in and the inside handle turns, but the bar that 
connects it to the latch just flexes...this bus has been sitting a few years, 
is there anyway to get the latch to release without mangling the door?
