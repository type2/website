&gt; Can ANYONE shed some light on NEATO/LIMBO.....

Not sure about LiMBO, but I'll add to the previous comment on
NEATO.

&gt; I have sent my money and my application over a month ago,and have
&gt; not heard a thing back.....

I'm the NEATO Treasurer, and your check reached me in late
September.  It came to me by way of the membership guru, so
you're in his files for the next newsletter.

&gt; When I called I just got a recording
&gt; that &quot;this number is NO LONGER in service&quot;.....Are they still
&gt; around???

The NEATO phone number listed in some older Old Bus Reviews and
other places was the number for Tom Brouillette (former editor)
in Albuquerque, NM.  There is a new number in the most recent
OBR's (now you're going to ask me the new number and I'm at work
and don't have it handy).  Tom recently moved from New Mexico and
the old number has been disconnected for that reason.

&gt; or have they gone by way of SOTO(Taking your cash,and
&gt; well you know the rest)

Yeah, we're having a great time spending your money!  Yours came
in with another $700 or so and the party has been going for quite
a while.  Oops, I keep having flashbacks to when I was in SOTO.

Actually, I recently wrote checks for printing OBR #68 and for
the postage to mail it out.  I haven't communicated with Dave
Easterwood for a couple of weeks, but the hang up is probably
with the Transporter Tourist and Travel (TTT) directory which is
scheduled to go out with this newsletter.  Another NEATO/LiMBO
advantage those in cyberspace don't get.

As long as I'm tooting NEATO's horn, I'll beep mine as well.  OBR
68 will have an excellent article on VW bus paint codes from 1959
to 1967.  After collecting Production Plate (M-Codes, etc.)
information from over 300 buses, I submitted an article detailing
the standard and optional colors used for buses since VW started
putting the codes on the Production Plate.  I have found examples
of 55 codes listed on the plate and know of another 25 codes VW
used, but haven't turned up in the NEATO Old Bus Registry yet.
Another NEATO advantage those in cyberspace don't get.

So, hang in a little bit longer.  NEATO stuff will arrive soon.
