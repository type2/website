Subject: Re: [VB] re:what are these red things

The black stock mounts transmit less vibration to the 
chassis. If you think about how the tranny and engine 
are suspended, most of the weight is on those mounts 
with some of the leveraged force held by the front 
tranny mount. My DC didn't have the red urethane front 
mount, so changed rear mount did reduce vibration. 

I did adjust the shifter up front, I can't attribute 
improved shifting to the mounts.

&gt; was writ&quot;There is a notable difference in vibration and in shifting&quot;
&gt; 
&gt; not quite sure what you mean? is is quieter with the stock ones or louder?
