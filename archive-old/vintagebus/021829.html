 About a week ago there was a thread about clunks in the 
 transmission on taking off. The thread ran out just as my 
 tranny clunks began.
 
 I checked all the mounts and everything seems tight except 
 for the right side rear 27mm bolt that secures the engine 
 mounting plate to the chassis(does this make any sense?) This 
 one is sufficiently loose for the warpy washer under it to 
 spin freely. Could this be responsible for the clunk and what 
 do I torque it to?
 
 I was able to turn the spring plate to RG box bolts a quarter 
 turn before my tendons twanged but they were not really 
 loose. What do I torque these to?
 
 Is it true that a clunk every time power is engaged or 
 disengaged suggests loose mounts rather than worn fulcrum 
 plates?(just typing that question has given me the cold sweats)
 
 I have lost my manual hence the torque related questions.
 
 TIA for any help
