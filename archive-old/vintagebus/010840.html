&lt;&lt; This (Reserve) knob, where is it located.  I recently purchased a 61 and I 
am still learning a lot about my new bus.  Reserve tank...this is new. &gt;&gt;
To the right of the heater control knob.  Right=reserve!  There is only one 
tank just a differances in hieght of two tubes which allow the fuel to exit 
the tank.  On the left side of the heater knob should be the choke cable 
control knob if you had a pre-1961 bus.
