People,

Please use common sense when announcing stuff for sale, VW events
and whatnot.

The list membership does not change very much - I see every single
subscribe and unsubscribe request - so it should be more than
sufficient to mention maybe a month before, and then maybe the week
before, to give listmembers in that geographical region a heads up.
Posting it every day or every other day doesn't really do any good.
Everyone close enough to go most likely already knows about it.
Continuous hyping of the event just makes the ones who can't go jealous,
and contemptuous, like bragging to a cosmetically-challenged friend
how much you've been getting laid lately.

I'm not trying to squelch content or anything; just the endless repetition
of said content.

Thanks.
