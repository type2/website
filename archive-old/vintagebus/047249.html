&lt;&lt;  The one in my '61 was rebuilt 1 yr. ago and has a slightly higher ring 
and pinion gear ( it's a bug trans with '60 axles/reduction boxes ), and it 
doesn't leak a drop!  I know this is some what of a backwards swap, small nut 
into a big nut, however I know my '61 trans is good.  The trans in the '64 is 
quiet and shifted smoothly, but I know nothing of its past history. &gt;&gt;
Hi Greg,
Hmmm, unfortunitly not alot of info on the gearing to go by.  If the tranny 
in your 60 is a bug geared tranny it will have a .89 fourth which is alot 
lower geared (about 5MPH lower in fourth gear) than the stock .82 used in the 
bus and KG.  First thing would be best to tach each truck and see where 1,500 
and 3,000 RPM is in 2 thru 4th gear at which MPH.  Since it will cost you 
time, trouble, and about $200-300.00 labor to have a tranny shop redo the 
gearing inside the bug tranny it probably would be better for you just to 
have a new tranny center section rebuilt with gearing more for a bus/truck.  
At the least you should have a 4.12 R&amp;P installed with the 64 and later 
bigger brakes and lower geared RGBs or as we have done to go to the 3.875 R&amp;P 
(We are going to try out a 3.44 R&amp;P freeway flier sometime soon!) freeway 
flier also with the later suspension.  If you are doing 60 miles a day you 
will save plenty of $ in gas savings and engine longevity by being able to 
keep the engine RPM down to 3,000 RPM and still keep up with most of the 
traffic.  Which will pay for the rebuilt tranny easily in only the first 
50,000 miles.  Eric&amp;Barb
