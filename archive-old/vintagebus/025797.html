&gt; &gt;Any buses with sunroof, or double cargo doors, or double slider cargo doors.

&gt; High-Roof busses, and fire trucks also had the belly-pans, (at least all the
&gt; ones i've seen) or &quot;sub floors&quot; as we seem to be calling them these days.

Also, I have seen many doormobiles with belly pans(subfloors).At least the ones
that
were destined from the factory to doormobile.I am not sure if these were kombis
with sunroofs or if doormobile
cut the hole themselves.
