Hi all.

Just so you all know, my grandma went home yesterday at 4:16pm....It's been
a rough week.

Also, I did decide that all my VWs have to go, so I can just get one.  So,
yes, the bus is now on the market...

Email if interested.....

Later.

Mr.VW

'67 Deluxe Bus (with IRS rear suspension, for sale!)
'68 Beetle (for sale!)
'73 Beetle (parts car, also for sale)
'74 Super Beetle (for sale!)
'85 Ford Club Wagon (the &quot;Beast&quot;)

&quot;An honest answer is like a kiss on the lips.&quot;
