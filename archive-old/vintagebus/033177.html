Hummmm? You guys never seem to amaze me. You send me hate mail when I tell
someone how to lower there bus the &quot;correct&quot; way, but you give tips and hints
on how to lobotomize his bus. THIS is what ruins buses, what happens when he
thinks that he's in too deep, or just gives up. One more for the yard! I agree
with Shawn and Mike.
