Subject: re:fuel shut off valve

Is there a 6V version of this? How does this work exactly...ie if your
battery is dead or disconnected-does the fuel flow? Or does it need to have
a battery connected for the fuel to flow? I was thinking if you go to remove
your engine, will this be an aid or hindrance?

I have also seen some simpler shut off valves at the following spots:

http://www_dot_castoinc_dot_com/lawn/20.html

or this cool looking quick disconnect:

I haven't tried one of these yet, but keep telling myself I'mm going to
install one next time I pull my engine....
