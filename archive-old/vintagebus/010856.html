Hi John,
As far as we have heard and would like to try some tests POR-15 does not have 
any self sacrificing elements to it.  Instead it is a good coater of and turn 
chemically inert slightly rusty iron or steel and therefore the person 
applying it does not have to go to all the work to completely derust, primer, 
and paint the steel/iron quickly to prevent it from rusting especially in 
humid climates.  Many POR-15 advocates swear by it &quot;Because it is really hard 
paint!&quot;.  Hard is not always good!  Go out and buy a perfect one carot 
diamond which is the hardest material know to humanhind.  Set it down on a 
slab of concret and hit it with a hammer and all you will have is a bunch of 
diamond dust.
  Steel is actually a more pure form of iron, but without the high content of 
carbon atoms that iron has.  Steel/iron oxidation digs into the material by 
expansion, so the rust just gets deeper and deeper into the metal due to 
flaking action of the rust which exposes the next layer of metal to rust.
  Ever notice how metals like copper, silver, lead, zinc, and even alloys 
like brass, and alot of Stainless steel do not seem to rust and deteriorate 
like steel/iron?  This is because these metals and alloys do rust/oxide but 
when this happens there is little to no expansion of the oxided layer.  Thus 
the outer layer of metal is oxided, but since this layer does not flake off 
the next layer is not exposed!  Only erosion from wind and water exposes the 
next layer of metal.  This is why roofing with copper lasts so darned long 
when a simular thickness of steel/iron would have long since rusted away.
   Plus when you plate, hot dip or paint metals like steel, iron, and even 
aluminuim with a coating of zinc the zinc layer is self sacrificing.  Which 
is why VW used a zinc primer at thier factories!  In otherwords the zinc will 
protect the metal underneath it even if the zinc layer is cracked, chipped or 
scratched through to the steel/iron and slows the rust/oxidation to a very 
slow crawl and confind to the exposed area.  With normal primer and paint if 
there is a crack, chip or scratch through to the steel/iron underneath the 
rust/oxide works to get under the cliff of paint and even through most 
primers (Since the majority of primers are not water/gas tight!).  The oxided 
steel/iron expands and the paint/primer are crowbarred up and crack away from 
the steel/iron to expose even more to rust/oxide, and the cycle continues on 
and on!
  In otherwords we had our 1963 KG body worked and painted.  The shop 
completely stripped the nose and many other areas of this VW and used 
standard no zinc primer and a good quality of paint.  Result is whenever we 
drove the KG we get paint chips in the front especially the nose.  These 
chips almost immeadiately begin to rust and if one does not treat and repaint 
these spots they just get visably bigger and bigger diameter week by week.  
On Nermal our 1960 panel camper conversion the nose had the same treatment 
via DPO as done to our 1963 KG with the same results of visably spreading 
rust spots.  Plus on top of using normal non-zinc primer the painter of this 
bus sanded the primer too smooth for good gripping of the light yellow paint 
over this primer!  You can scrape large chips of paint off the primer with 
just a butter knife with ease!  So we completely sanded back down the nose of 
Nermal and gave it a coat of high content zinc primer and sprayed a cheap 
rattle can of light gray color.  That was at least five or six years ago and 
we have traveled 69,000 miles in the last five years and this bus has been a 
daily driver, not garaged, or carported until last year when we got the 
Costco canopies!  Even with no no repair work done in that time to the nose 
though there are alot of small chips in the paint, the biggest one is less 
than 1/4 inch across!    Plus we have found bare steel under the paint in 
areas on the sides of this bus, and have only lightly sand these areas rust 
free and thinly one coat with zinc primer without any painting over of these 
areas.  Result is instead of a month or two for normal primers for the steel 
rust to bleed visably through, the high zinc content primer takes over two 
years here in the rainy PNW!  
  For this high zinc primer we have been using NAPA Zinc - Rich primer 
Balkamp # 765-1610.  It has a 95% Pure Zinc Formulation.  According to 
Popular Mechanic Magazine any zinc primer with a zinc content lower than 85% 
is not worth using.  The only problem we have had with this primer is the 
fact that the zinc is heavy and tends to settle into a thick mud in the 
bottom of the rattle cans causing the primer to spay out like X-mas tree 
flocking.  Turns out to prevent this, one should pull out the can/s to be 
used at least 48 hourd before and about every 12 hours shake and when putting 
the can/s down for the next 12 hours make sure to set the can/s upside down 
from what postion it was the previous 12 hour period.  Then this primer 
sprays smoothly.
  So how about this anyone doing some POR-15 work?  How about treating ten 
3-4&quot; squares of otherwise bare sheet metal.  We will do the same and trade 
five of our pieces for five of your's.  Then paint most and leave others just 
zinc primer and POR-15.  Scratch one side of each square and hang all out in 
the weather or better yet behind rear wheel/s of a daily driver VW.  Then 
every six month period take digital pictures and notes.  Post these results 
each time on a website and continue the test for at least three years.  Would 
be even better if the other person lived in a salt/rust belt of the world!
