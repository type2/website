Subject: Flasher Relay help needed

I've solved all the electical stuff wrong with the 65, except for one thing.
The indicator lights in speedometer do not blink for a left turn.  My bus
has the emergency flasher switch and red light, and was converted to 12
Volt.  In the 65 wiring diagram, the relay seems to have three prongs plus
ground.  The one currrently in there (aftermarket) has three prongs, but no
apparent ground.  I've checked all catalogs, but don't see any relays listed
for 65 with emergency flasher.

What should it look like, or have on it?  Any ideas?  BTW, out of curiosity,
should the indicator lights be blinking for right turn without key in start
position?

 Thanks in advance
