&lt;&lt; 1.  Is it normal for the inner race to stay with the inboard bearing?&gt;&gt;
Hi Matt,
Bearing race no.
 
&lt;&lt; 2.  Should there be a separate spacer on the spindle, or have I described 
the &quot;integral&quot; spacer?  Is one lip of the grease seal supposed to seat on 
this spacer?&gt;&gt;
Yes to the latter.
 
&lt;&lt; 3.  Should the inboard bearing inner race turn freely on the spindle?  I 
know the cage/rollers should turn on the race - that's their purpose in life 
- but I'm not sure the race should turn.&gt;&gt;
Yes, that is fine!
 
&lt;&lt; 3.  Is it a safe assumption that the Brazilian wheel cylinders aren't 
original?&gt;&gt;
Correct!
 
&lt;&lt;4.  Should that upper shock absorber bolt and nut be tight to the frame 
horn?&gt;&gt;
Yes, or the mounting hole will be ovaled due to this wobbling.
 
&lt;&lt;5.  Should I be able to drive the grease seal flush with the hub or even 
further in, or is it supposed to stick up a bit? &gt;&gt;
Most of the time yes to the former, but sometimes the bore for the grease 
seal is just not deep enough.  If in doubt measure the bore depth and compare 
it to the seal thickness.  Eric&amp;Barb
