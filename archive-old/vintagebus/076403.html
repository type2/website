Subject: Engine locked up

Hey Volks

I've been thinking the vintagebus list is getting far too
quiet and thought I should find something to contribute, but
this wasn't what I had in mind.

Driving my 75 Fleetline panelvan home from work on the
highway this evening it felt for a brief moment that the bus
was being held back, then all was well again. It felt like a
seizure coming on but it was so brief and since we were
climbing a long hill at 90km/h (55mph) I thought it must be
the hill and thought nothing further of it.

I got home and parked on the kerb outside my gate and shut
the engine down; it was idling fine. I went inside and
opened the garage door and then got back in the bus and
turned the key: THUKK!! Turned it again and THUKK!! I went
back to the engine to find I couldn't turn it over by hand
with the crank pulley. It's locked solid. I felt the
dipstick and it was well cool; this is a 1600SP with DP fan
and doghouse oil cooler. I checked the oil and it was
between the lines. Apart from that one moment of drag the
20km drive home was a breeze: 90km/h the whole way on the
freeway, engine smooth, quiet and powerful. No ticks, knocks
or other unusual noises. But now it's locked up solid.

WTF???
