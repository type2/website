If you get all this stuff, $400 sounds about right. 
For example, I seen just the spice rack selling for
250.  Of course the seller was totally out of his
mind.

Ellis blabs,
I too saw an L shaped whatnot cabinet FS at the OCTO
but it was priced at $275.00 **as written in black
magic marker!!!** on the otherwise unusually perfect
cabinet.
Yeah, I'd probably not out of his mind but obviously
ignorant on two counts by my observation. Dont know
the gentleman so I wont make any judgements. 
I'd align myself with creating your own, searching for
a reasonable price like the one that was at last
June's Classic for $40.00, or doing without. I cobbled
mine together from two rough ones which were donated
by Kevin what's hisface Murray(?) in Florida and
Michael Heron. Thanks guys! Surprisingly the vintage
nazis never lynched me or dragged me behind a truck
and the old L shaped sumbidge does a bang up job of
holding my peanutbutter and toilet paper and other
small items in place on the door... $275.00 would go a
long way toward buying masonite, brass nails, Formica
sheeting, glue and other supplies $275.00 Hahahahaha!
My belated Father used to warn me that &quot;A quick nickle
is better than a slow dime.&quot; Lord knows that I've
learned THAT lesson lately.
