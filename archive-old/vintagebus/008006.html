I'm not sure my input is necessary, but I agree with the gentleman from CA.
I recently &quot;retired&quot; my '67 Kombi in the interest of safety.  I figured that
although it did run and the brakes were strong (even if the drums are a bit
worn), it was getting to where *something* was going to go, and I couldn't
afford to fix it correctly.  Not being able to stop is a problem worth
keeping a bus off the road, but also IMHO coming to a halt in the middle of
the interstate because the tranny locks up, or the engine does Something
Bad, is just as dangerous when the average speed of the other cars hovers
between 80 and 90mph.

I'm not interested in endangering my own safety and that of others to enjoy
my bus.  I skipped HCBF even though I probably would have made the trip ok.
What I'm interested in now is fixing up my Westy so I can be out of the
Che*y Spectrum I'm driving, and back into the vehicle that I love, safely.

Two cents from an infrequent poster.  ;-)

&gt; I took a lot of flamage last year on this topic, and my nomex are all
&gt; ready to go this year.
&gt;
&gt; Like I said last year, running an unsafe bus is a desperate measure.
&gt; It's one thing to break down in BFE and have to limp into town
&gt; without all systems 100%.  There aren't any Chinese tanks rolling down
&gt; the street towards your house.  No mushroom cloud drifting towards your
town.
&gt; No wildfire encroaching on your home.  No dam about to burst.  Desperate
&gt; times call for desperate measures.  Driving several hundred miles
&gt; into the desert to party isn't one of them.
