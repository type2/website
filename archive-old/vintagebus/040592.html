Where are you?


Hi list-

Does anybody know of a beyond saving splitty crew cab that might be a 
donor for a body part?

Mine is missing a portion of the rear body structure (on the drivers 
side behind the rear seat) that the rear seat support structure bolts 
to.  It also looks like something is missing on the just below the 
forward end of the pickup bed in the pax compartment.  (Is there are 
door or access panel behind the rear seat?).

Any help or leads would be much appreciated.  Also, if somebody could 
forward a picture of the area in question, I might be able to have 
something fabricated.

TIA

Dave
