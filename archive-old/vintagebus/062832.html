Subject: RE: [VB] Cargo door handle

 Actually I think there are more 67 handles out there then the earlier. In
all my handles and in most of my buses they have and/or are 67 L key
profiles. I have a harder time finding the earlier then the latter. I would
gladley trade L profile handles for any earlier ones.
  My 60 DD 2 L profile, 60 Deluxe L profile, 63 Westy (just aquired) L
profile. I haven't checked my other 5 buses yet to see what they have. 
  I think the reason for this is that after 67 that is all the VW had made
and when ever someone came in with a broken handle , it was replaced with
the later L profile. I still find 67 only used and NOS handles at the swaps
on a regular basis.

ronnie   Wanted and pre 67 cargo door handle (long shaft)

ps. I do find a lot of early panel handle though!

yes, especially because 67 cargo door handles break.  if you see a bus with
a 
broken cargo door handle 95% chance its a 67.  as the key is longer the 
handle is weaker, and yanking the handle eventually breaks it off, (but does

not open the door)

 Hi Paul,
 The 1967 &quot;L&quot; profile key is much longer so no way will your shorter &quot;T&quot; 
 tumbler fit.  If you have &quot;L&quot; profile handles trade them to 1967 owners for

 the &quot;T&quot; ones you need.  Since the &quot;L&quot; profile parts are one year only you 
 will probably have alot of 1967 owners trying to batter down your front
door 
 soon to get those parts!
