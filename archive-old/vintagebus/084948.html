Subject: Re: [VB] $99,000 Westy

I wouldn't be afraid to wearing the rubber on the gas pedal - because there
isn't one on the pedal from the factory to begin with - it's all metal. Only
Type 1s &amp; 3s have gas pedal rubber pads.
 Why not drive it? My late father and I daily drove a fully restored (twice)
1950 Split Window Beetle for 20 years (66 to 86). VWs are made to be driven
and utilized.
 Well........there is the fact that for the last 10 years we had it that my
father and I ran a 2180 w/dual 40 IDFs, Scintilla Mag, a Tunnel Trans (with
a very tall [Bus] 4th Gear - who needs a five speed?) and Porsche 356B
Brakes all the way around. Looked bone stock otherwise until you pressed the
OG Starter Button on the bottom center of the dash :-)......Ask Joe Crockett
about the car sometime, he'll fill you in on the
rest.........................
 Someday I'll scan the photos (if I can find 'em) and post them on my
site......

&gt; But really - how many people would want a 100K Westy. Its not like you
&gt; could actually drive it - at least, I couldn't. I'd be terrified of
&gt; wearing
&gt; the rubber on the gas peddle.
