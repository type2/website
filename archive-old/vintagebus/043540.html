Hello all!

After finding George Lyle's list of &quot;MX codes&quot; (M-codes that VW forgot)
in the archive, I was inspired to start a list of &quot;VWX&quot; numbers...special
tools that VW forgot to mention.  The list has grown to 18 tools that
you just won't find in the VW literature, not even the &quot;Tools for Local
Manufacture&quot; book.

The current list, with contributors, is below.  Help fill in the gaps
in this list!  Note: If it's not Friday when inspiration strikes you,
private mail would probably be better.  I'll keep the list compiled
and post it a few more times until it seems &quot;done.&quot;  Keep those cards
and letters comin', now!
