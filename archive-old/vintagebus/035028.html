Also a proper anvil and a GBH[1] Put the rivet thru the clip and wheel (I 
know, you already know this part :), put the wheel/rivet/clip sandwich on the 
anvil so that the rivet is
 *tight* in place, take a blow torch to the rivet 'til the rivet is cherry 
red, then whack it a good one with the GBH.  &gt;&gt;
  
Hi Steve,
Heating the rivet before installing it in the rim will work, but heating it 
it while it is in the rim might change the hardness of the steel of the rim 
in that area.  Which could be disastorous.  Check out any of the Bentley 
reprinted shop manuals for to VW proceedure for installing and removing 
these.  Eric&amp;Barb
