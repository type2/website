Subject: Vallejo Show Trip Report- Brief


Went to the show and had a very nice time albeit to brief a visit given 
other pressing matters.  Saw Dave and his 15 there... wish I had given Dave 
my phone since I live in Benicia and could have pulled him over to my house 
in Benicia so he could do the quick fix...

I was disappointed in that I did not find a nice rear deluxe bumper for my 
bus, a radio block off plate or the vent trim (the little chrome strips 
along the engine vents... sigh.  Nice to see a few buses even though, as 
Dave said, there were a bunch of water pumpers (which were nice too) and 
T1's.

So I went home and gardened followed up with a nice little Cinco de Mayo 
magarita in the sun.
