Very good idea!  Those were the starter for the Automatics
I believe.  If so I think the Bosch number is an SR17X??
Also, for those big compression motors that strain your
stock starter Kennedy Engineered Products sells a VW
diesel starter with a special adapter nosecone to mount
to your trans.  If it will crank over one of those pigs on a
cold morning think of what it'll do to your 1600!
