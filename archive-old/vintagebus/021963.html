Today, I pulled the engine from a 1973 beetle. I think the engine is good 
and, if not, it may be a very good case to rebuild. I picked it and the 
starter up for $100.00. I know I need to go back for that sleeve or 
whatever you call it that the starter needs. At any rate, tomorrow is 
likely to be the last day that I can pull parts off of this thing. I know 
I should pull the tranny, but time does not permit. Are there any other 
parts that list members can suggest that I get while the gettin' is 
good?? My bus is a 1965 Westy, so I doubt there are many.

pull the wiring harness, you can then do wiring repairs with correct wires in
an assortment of colours.
