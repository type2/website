hey all

i recently aquired a 64 kombi in og unrunning
condition. just to check it out i was planning on
sticking one of my other engines in there to see how
everything was doing-now the shifter some how isnt
hooked up. i went under and checked everything and
found the problem. right around the nosecone is a rod
coming out of the tranny and at the end of it is a
circular plate then... a space... then another
circular plate followed by the rest of the linkage to
the shifter. what exactly do i need to buy for this
&quot;space&quot;? whats involved in this as far as taking the
tranny out and everything. thanks in adavance
