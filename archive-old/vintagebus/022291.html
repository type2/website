Subject: Bus Gonna Be For Sale
Mime-Version: 1.0

Recently, Kurt Smith here in Saint Louis found a nice 99% rust free 1967
Kombi and bought it.  Pat Hoffman and myself have dedicated ourselves to
stripping off the cheezy hand paint job and basically restoring it back to
it's original glory.  We have been working on it since Sunday with me
driving to Pat's house each evening.

I will have to admit, I am learning more and more about the artful split
window busses as we are working on it.  The kid that owned was about to
lower and chop it when Kurt offered him the opportunity to sell it.  I
think he needed the money so essentially we rescued it from sure
hot-roddish demise.

By the time it is finished the bus will have all new seals, new paint
(after being stripped, sanded, and primered), new engine (rebuilt),, new
glass in the front, and other new odds and ends including the emblem.  We
are sand blasting everything that even looks like a rust spot so in the end
you could call it 99.9% rust free.

Asking $6500.00 for the starting price but of course will negotiate.

As I said, the bus is essentially rust-free and will be one fine looking,
solid reliable machine when we are finished.  We still haven't decided on
the color.

If anyone is interested please e-mail me directly or give me a call at 314
772-8197.
