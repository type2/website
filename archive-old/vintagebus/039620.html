well... when i got my first bus it would take bumps as you are describing 
your as taking them. VERY rough. i would hit my head on the ceiling on this 
one dip close to my house, and then slam down on the seat. are you sure that 
the king and links arent seized together? will the front end take any 
grease? if the front end is really rusty, or has been neglected, this could 
be the case. check it out :-)
