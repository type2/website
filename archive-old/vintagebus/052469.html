&gt;you know those 12v to 110 power converters?

Yes.

&gt;so iwas thinking of getting a power converter that could put 
&gt;out 1500 watts.

$250 to $300, 12 volt only.  A 6V DC to 120V AC inverter is made
out of unobtainium.

&gt;now my question is, will that put too much strain on the 
&gt;battery/generator?

Yes.

&gt;would i have to go for an alternator at that point?

Well, 1500 watts at 12 volts is 125 amps.  This is about four
stock VW generators or three stock VW alternators.

You'll have to supply more than 125 amps to the inverter because 
it is not 100% efficient - more like 80 to 90%, so you'll have to
come up with 140 to 160 amps or so.  You can get alternators this
big - just go down to your Dodge dealer and ask for the alternator
from a Ram 3500 with the V10 Cummins turbodiesel.  If you can get
that beauty for $200 I'd be impressed.

Your price tag is now up to $450 or more, and you haven't even
mounted the alternator on the engine or bought the heavy cables
you'll need yet.  If you do hook this up and turn it on, you'll
also lose over 2 horsepower from the engine (1 HP = 746 W).

By contrast, it looks like you can get a used Eberspaecher for
maybe $200 or so.  No power loss from the engine; no wiring or
alternator brackets to make.

Or, if you really want to try electric heat, try one of those
little ceramic heaters that are made for cars.  They only pull
about 10 amps (120 watts) but may be better than nothing.
