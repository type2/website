 Hey list,
 I had a strange experience today. I was driving 35mph and the strangest 
sound 
 occured. First of all, my tranny is starting to whine quite a bit... The 
 noise was like my starter was engaged after the bus was already running. A 
 constant &quot;crunch&quot; when I was driving? I pulled over to turn it off (the 
bus), 
 started right back up completely fine? I don't get it. Should I save up for 
a 
 new tranny soon... I'm leaving for the University of Oregon next week, so I 
 may not be able to tackle it 'til christmas break, but I'd like to have an 
 idea of what's goin on. My tranny doesn't pop out of gear and runs good 
 besides a bit of noise.
  &gt;&gt;

change your gear oil, and do a tea leak reading.  If it really is a tranny 
noise and not the starter running all the time due to crossed wires (BTDT, 
had to get a new starter), this will help extend the doomed tranny.  Then 
again, then all have a finite life span and you may get 100,000 more miles 
out of it, but probably not so start saving.  or don't.  crunchy noises and 
whines getting louder do not heal, just get worse.  I drove one to the end 
once, and ended up with a shreiking sound of tearing metal, and a bus that 
went no where.   Kind cool noise, but I really dont recommend this drive it 
till it kills you system as it is rather inconvient and there goes you core 
tranny and rgb/axles/bearings etc all full of shavings

then again, it could be in a RGBox?    can you jack up the back of the bus 
and see if you have a lot of play in a rear wheel or it makes crunchy noises 
when you spin it?  If you have really bad RGbox bearings and keep driving the 
gears will start jumping around and eat through the RGBox case.  This may 
take a while if you just put around town.  It is loud and noticable.   then 
all the oil falls out and the shavings from the case get in the works, and 
something will give, in one instance (not me) it was the axle shaft, and the 
bus wouldn't go no more even when the engine was running.  At that point it 
is a lot more work to fix than when the moise started.  so depending on the 
noise... if it worries you I would check out the rear wheels and the gear 
oil.   brass gleams in the gear oil is synchros going, and whiny trannys tend 
to have brass gleams in the gear oil drained out of them.    Does it make the 
noise in all gears?  louder at certain speeds?
