Subject: my trip to marin


well the trip to marin with sam went well except when 
sams coil wire popped of right at the enterance, but 
after a few minutes of looking around he found the 
problem . But on my way home before the gg bridge i had 
to down shift becouse of the hill and when i went to go 
shift back to fourth there was no fourth! so i try third 
no third! luckily my girlfriend ws right behind me with 
her brother. so we push my bus up the hill and get it 
into a pull off before the golden gate bridge. i find 
that the bolt that hold the shifter linkage is gone! so 
i jack it up and start looking fo bolts. I used a under 
sized bolt with red silicone and tied it up with a 
plastic bag. It worked for 2 shifts but just fell out.
i jack it back up and start looking for anything that 
will work i find a carburator stud and bolt , i put it 
in and it FITS! now i just have to make sure it going to 
hold when i shift. After a couple shifts in the lot and 
i was off. well i made it home with no more problems .
