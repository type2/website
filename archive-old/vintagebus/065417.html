Hi Nick,
An oil cooler type heater definitely will not heat your interior well once 
the outside temps drop below freezing.  We have seen how much freezing 
outside temps lower enigne oil temps.  The stock heat exchangers produce more 
BTUs since they take heat directly off the hot exhaust gases.
  Plus unless you really need the extra oil cooling, having external oil 
pressure lines are just another part to fail and loose oil pressure ruining 
your engine.  If we ever do try installing an external oil cooler we would 
install metal oil cooler lines to and from the cooler and only have short 
flex pressure lines to attach to the engine.  Gauges would be a must.
