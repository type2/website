I'll second that one; I run my filter off the bumper bracket as well. I had
a farmer at a gas stop shake his head at me for mounting my filter under the
bus, but I have had it that way for five years with no problems. Even
mounted on my bug, I never had a rock puncture the filter. However, I did
have one blow up on me one cold winter morning with a gut wrenching pop!
Waited too long to change out my 30wt. Messy!
