well,

this is just a quick report on what i've been doing this week.

I hope to be driving my bus by this time tomorrow...

Over the last few days i have worked on the electrics, and all is working
100 percent. (cept i have the headlights in upside down, oops.  PO had the
buckets on the wrong sides with the drainholes pointing up, i put em back
the right way round, but forgot to flip the headlights, heh)

Last night i finished stripping down that used type3 engine i had bought.
The endplay was a bit out of spec, so i am getting a new shim stack after
work today.  The thrust seemed okay as that front main bearing wasnt
moving around.

I think this engine had a fuel injection problem that put it on the
inactive list as there was about 2X as much oil as you would expect to
come out of a t1 engine, and it reeked of gasoline. (rich running is my
guess..)

I bent and broke my t3 to t1 dipstick adapter trying to figure out how the
heck to get it to go through the tin... whoops, but at least they arent
terribly expensive, and i have to go to the store anyway to get a shim
stack. (might buy an aftermarket rearmost tin because i dont want to cut
up a stock one for the dipstick hole)

As much as i hate to spend the money, i think i will just buy a new carb
when i go to the store tonight, i have one i rebuilt a while ago but i
took it off my 71 due to some wierdness, i'd hate to blow up this bus
because i am cheap ;)  Think i will go with a 34 pict as i have the dizzy
for that carb, and i hear they get the best fuel mileage due to having 3
circuits, they are just a pain to tune..

Bonus stuff: the type3 engine has provisions for a mechanical fuel pump, i
wont have to use an aftermarket electric one after all :)

question:
how foolhardy is it to try and tap the case in situ for the oil pressure
switch, i am thinking if i grease up the drill and tap and am reallllly
careful then i wont have to use the t3 cooler.

I retract my original statements about the t3 cooler being superior, i
cant see one lick of difference between my doghouse cooler and that one,
and i'd rather be able to use the &quot;hoover bit&quot; as the oil pressure sender
hole gets in the way of using one of those. (the t3 cooler may well be
superior, i just dont want to diddle with it to find out...)

I am also adding a good used filter pump i have, there is a fair ammount
of guck in the bottom of the case, and i dont want that to get to the main
bearings...

Well, thats it for now...

hopefully i will post on the maiden voyage in the next few days...

take care,

Steve

P.S. man its quiet for a friday... i bet everyone is out at shows and
stuff...
