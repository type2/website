Gee, that does not sound too outrageous to me...and I
live in Ohio! ;-)  That is probably the rarest piece
in a 21 window I would think...anyone care to back me
up on that?  I have seen very few of these over the
years...have owned one or two and folks almost beat
each other over the head when they saw me unloading it
at the swap spot!...I think I sold those couple around
$75 each and that was many many years ago.

...but now $1000 for a southwind heater..what the heck
is the deal with that!?

:-)
