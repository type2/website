&gt; 1) Are mis-matched bearings OK ?

Yes as long as they are the correct numbers.  They are built to a
standard.

&gt; 2) Should I try to find used cylinders or should I fork over the
dinero for
&gt; the new
&gt; ones?

Well, as the saying goes:  Every time you step on the brakes your life
is in your foot's hands.

I wouldn't scrimp on the brakes.  A bit over $100 for the front wheel
cylinders doesn't seem out of line to me.  Price a pair of calipers
for a '71!

If you don't want to buy new cylinders, you can rebuild the old ones. 
Rebuilding consists of disassembly, cleaning, honing, and reassembly
with new seals.  The honing step removes any corrosion pitting from
the cylinder.  If this step makes the cylinder larger than the maximum
allowable diameter then it will have to be trashed.  Many people
consider the hassle of rebuilding wheel cylinders to be not worth the
cost savings, and I really can't blame them.
