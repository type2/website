Subject: re:  paint off chrome and other handle ?'s

I don't know if this was the proper way to do this, but I used a fine
steel wool. Chrome is a very hard metal, and the steel wool doesn't
really seem to hurt it.

I've also used it to remove rust-thru on hubcaps and such, but it is
important to treat the surface immediately afterwards with some sort of
wax or acrylic to keep the rust from coming back. Rust-thru is usually
more a problem with aftermarket stuff. The chrome just isn't as good on
aftermarket stuff as it is on the original stuff...

I've also used steel wool on glass and rubber with good results.
