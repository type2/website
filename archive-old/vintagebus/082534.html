Subject: Re: [VB] Tilts for trucks

&gt; I just finished bending the U channel stock into into a set of tilt hoops
&gt; today for the SC, damn talk about a job getting the bends right without
&gt; flaring out the sidewalls on the stock when turning the end corners . Anyway
&gt; I was successful and now need to figure out how to make the caps that go
&gt; over the wood. Anyone have any ideas on how to make these?

Derek Gregg in Lancaster, CA. Makes very nice repro hoops &amp; endcaps. He
doesn't do the rubber bumpers, so he may be interested in ordering some.

  The end caps are much harder to make than the rest of the hoops-you have a
compound curve in the caps &amp; they turn out in a heart beat.  Without a huge
VW factory like press/jig, the best way to make them is by treating them
like a blacksmith would-w/ heat &amp; pounding while hot until they are
correctly shaped over a premade jig-good luck.  I have also seen what appear
to be og end caps that are a little crooked along the edges that face each
other when on the hoops.  It appears that the end caps were made as 1 piece
&amp; then cut lengthwise down the middle to make 2 endcaps. You could have the
steel plate rolled to the right radius from side to side in long pieces &amp;
then heat them up to get the 2 different radiuses required for the top of
hoop profile.

FWIW,
