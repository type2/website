Hi Christian,
The bus is no type 1.  In other words there is no way to just unbolt the bus 
body from it's frame/pan.  Take a look at the web page    
http://www.pipeline_dot_com.au/users/hoopty/default.htm    and look around.  
Especially this page   http://www.pipeline_dot_com.au/users/hoopty/page7.htm     
in there shows how the floor sections are replaced.   Eric&amp;Barb

Thanks Eric/Barb...

I wuz thinkin' this might be the case..  Most of the frame components from 
midway back have to be delt with.  It is major.  Floor pan(s) all around are
in excellent condition, tho..  The PO cut holes in the cross members to
accommodate a BA-6 Eberspacher which I must say when it werked, wuz a pleasure
of heat.  

again, thanx

-christian
