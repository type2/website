&gt; I'm building a stock 1600 with a brand new Brazillian case. 
&gt; 
&gt; Tired of pulling head studs and swapping bearings, I ordered the new
&gt; case from Bernie Bergman (from a HotVWs ad -- $350 plus $35 shipping). 
&gt; Nothing seemed out of the ordinary until I started preparing to apply
&gt; the Permatex seal and close the case.  The case has no V-shaped groove
&gt; in the cam shaft bore where the cam plug fits.
&gt; 
&gt; I don't see a way to use the old standard plug except by cutting off
&gt; the ridge.  Then, it would seem, it would be subject to being pushed out
&gt; by oil pressure in the case.

There are two ways you can go.  One way is to machine the groove into the
new case and use an old style plug.  The second is to use the new style
plastic plug, as is done on all new production engines.
