&gt; Ya know, I am gonna incurr such a wrath for saying
&gt; this, but *nothing* on a
&gt; bus should cost that much (save for engine, paint or
&gt; body work).  I've been
&gt; writing an article on my beef with eBay...how it's
&gt; artificially inflated
&gt; the prices on the used parts market, but I realise
&gt; now that you don't
&gt; always need eBay to get outrageous prices.  Before
&gt; anyone starts, I'm not
&gt; trying to pick on tds here.  I've seen these
&gt; senseless price blowups
&gt; before.  I know this is going to start such a
&gt; loooong thread (and I better
&gt; check email from school today) but if company X is
&gt; selling safaris for,
&gt; say, $300, then what about original safaris makes
&gt; them worth the extra
&gt; $100-300?  I'm not saying people don't have a right
&gt; to try to get what they
&gt; can for parts, I just want to understand the logic
&gt; behind it.
