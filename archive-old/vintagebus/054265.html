 what do you guys think of it - it's been an interesting point of discussion 
for decades.  &gt;&gt;

Hi Cal,
Good thing to do.  We use grease on ours and this prevents rusting into place 
and or being rusty and giving a erronous torque reading.  Up here in the PNW 
it only takes five years for a supension fastener to rust into place to the 
point of shearing off when unbolting.  Given the grease can result in a 
higher torque we use the lower torque reading when VW supplies it.  So far no 
broken fasteners for us doing this in nearly 500,000 miles of driving VWs 
between us.     Eric&amp;Barb
