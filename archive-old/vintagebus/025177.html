Does anyone know where I can get hinges for my pop-out windows?
 1962 15 window.

 Better buses came with only the 2 pop outs.
    I have been know to remove the extra pop outs

------------------------------------------------------------------------

I was just going to use piano hinge to put in the extra 4 pop outs in my
bus.  Now that I got the extra 2 with my parts bus I just need 2 more.
Clara, If you have troubles with leaks check out some fresh WCM rubbers.
If we didn't live so far apart, I would gladly unburden you of those
spare window frames you must have kicking around.

Daniel.
