Hi,

I finally went out and purchased a new radio/CD last night for my 64DD.
Installed it into the dash(horrors!). Yes the dash was upgraded to a 67 so
it fit with about 1/16 inch of filing. I found some KLH 4-1/2&quot;  outdoor
patio speakers that fit under the dash. They sound just fine. It is a good
solution. Anyone want a photo, just pmail me.

Chris
