Subject: Speedo Issue

Hey all,
 
Back in April, I posted regarding my speedo not working at all.  I had already replaced the speedo with another unit, then replaced the cable which fixed everything.
 
Fast forward to last Sunday.  Drive out to Buses in the Shop and everything's cool.  Go to leave the show and the needle jumps a couple times and then registers nothing!  Augh, I think, killed another cable.  I half expected to pull off the hubcap and find the clip sucked into the dustcap and obvious signs of brokenness.  Believe it or not, nope.  The cable and the clip look just fine!  So I go to loosen the cable and see if maybe things weren't lining up just right...and I could not get the cable to loosen at the back of the speedo at all.  Maybe I just have weak fingers, but it wouldn't budge.
 
Thoughts anyone?  For the record, it's a new bay window cable in a 67 bus with a 64 speedo.
 
-Taylor
