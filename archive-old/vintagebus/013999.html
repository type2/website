Howdy all. Thanks to nasty neighborhood no-gooders, my personalized 
license plate is gone, and my taillights smashed on my '62 crew cab. 
Although no one can help me deal with the mess at DMV, I am hoping 
someone can hook me up with a better price than $20.00 each for tail 
light lenses that seems to be the going rate new. These are the red oval 
lenses, used from 62-71. I don't want new ones, or really care if they're 
scuffed or cracked, as long as they're in one piece. Cheap would be nice...
I'm in Raleigh, NC. Please e-mail me if you have a couple extras lying 
around. 
Thanks,
