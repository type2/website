Hi All,

Today has been the worst rain since I got my crew, and the recent time
change on the clock ensured it was dark coming home.

My truck is cold and drafty, mostly due to all three doors not sealing well.
All rubber is gone and I have it on the to-do list...

But, my to-do list is too long.  I've got a new motor to put in, new tranny
too.  Taking care of mechanical to make this a safe daily driver, but the
drafts are causing problems... rain and condensation.  Heat can't keep up
with the drafts :)

What is the consensus on paying someone to do rubber work?  Is this
something a good VWFLAPS shop can do?  Any listees for hire in Seattle /
Olympia area who have done this before?  Any idea on what to expect in terms
of cost / time?

I just have too much to do, and I want it done for practical / safety
reasons.  I know it isn't a huge project, I'd just rather have it done right
the first time.
