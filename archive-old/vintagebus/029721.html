&gt; And take compressionn readings.  
&gt;
Which brings up a topic, what is an acceptable compression for a 36hp engine?
 

Based on the figures on http://type2_dot_com/library/engineg/comrat.htm and
my 1954 manual which states a compression ratio of 6.1, I get an acceptable
compression ratio range of 88-106 psi.  And the wear limit would be somewhere
down around 75 psi?  That seems real low.
