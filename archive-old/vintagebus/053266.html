Subject: The EZ is forever immortalized!...sort of...

It's Friday for some of somebody.

And the story begins.....
As I zigzagged thru the mountain canyons on my way home from work, the ol' 
lady gives me a ring......&quot;we need blah...blah..blah ..from the store...ok 
hon' love ya bye&quot;
I hang up the phone and crank ol Dub Miller a little louder.  Pull into the 
grocery store and head inside.  grab the required supplies for dinner and 
head on over to the magazine rack.  Coolio, I thinks to myself...new HotVW's. 
 pick her up and head to the cashier and then fire up the EZ for home.

Get home and do the normal get home chores, play with daughter, yak with ol' 
lady and finally get a little time to sit on the crappe....I mean, couch to 
read the Hot VW's mag.  Flip thru and start reading an article about the 
Familienfest and look down at the B/W pic of a camper at the bottom of the 
page. Hmmm....looks familiar...hell, every damn show I go to I somehow manage 
to park beside this dude.  Hey, wait...what's that in shadows behind it!?  
That looks like....It is!  There she is, my 63 EZ Camper, all half a cargo 
door and dark shadows of the interior, right behind this guys primo camper.  
I can even see the ass end of my daughter's wagon on the ground! Hehe....ok 
ok sorry guys, but hell...at least I can honestly say I'm in the mags.  Hell, 
If I ever sell it.._dot_can I say, featured in Hot VW's Magazine?  

Oh well...my nanosecond of fame.   Jan. 2002 Hot VW's- page 30-  like I 
said..BEHIND the nice camper in the picture.  I swear...that's my baby!

I guess it's time to end this nonsense....i need to get back to figuring out 
how to frame that pic = )
