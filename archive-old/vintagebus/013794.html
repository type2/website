Be careful, these were reproduced about 8-10 years ago
by some club on the west coast (can't recall who
someone in Cascade Kombis?) 

The repops are almost indistinguishable from the real
ones...the only exception is they seem to nice and the
paper and staples are very new...they don't have that
old patina a nos one would have.  The paper on the
repops is a bit glossy where the originals were not at
all.

Just a note
