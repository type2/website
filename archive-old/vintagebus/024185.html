Subject: Re: Needles the armpit

This is to Clara ,only because she mentioned it, and other listes
who hate the armpits of the U.S.A. You need to stop once in a while and
smell the armpits. Myself and friends have bought from the Needles
armpit the following: 58 walkthru panel,58 singlecab 2nd owner,61 s/c
original safaris, 63 deluxe, 64 crewcab, 67 deluxe, 62 s/c, 67 crewcab,
66 westy, 65 deluxe,64 kombi,63 kombi and I know I forgot some. Most of
these were bought within the last year. If Clara would have looked close
she might have seem the 54 panel in the pool. My point is not to knock
Clara or others , but to tell them when they get the gut feeling that
a place is an armpit manybe it is and others feel the same so no one
has spent to time to go into the armpit and smell it out for splitties.
My point is to look,look,look no matter what the area. Most of the best
finds latley have come from the armpits because all the roses have been
picked. About the only places we look any more are the armpits because
no one else looks there, but that might be all thats left. Where did
Koch find all those nos semephores last month? Rex all those original
safaris? Enough said, go out and pinch your nose and check the armpits.
See you at BBBIII in Jan.
