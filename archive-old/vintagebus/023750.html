Subject: Re: 67 HT Walkthru FS

Have a 67 HT Deluxe Walkthru FS. No interior panels or rr 2 seats. Has
headliner and ft. seats. All deluxe trim, windows there. Repainted gr/pw
once. Various dents around body, some rust, not bad though. Motor
dropped valve seat, out of bus. Wheelwells not cutout! Missing rr
bumper,clock,dash perfect, not cut. Good Calif title. Will sell to
listie for $1000.00 less engine. As I am restoring bus price will go up.
Call for more info and honest discription. Thanks,

Will deliver for expences within 500 miles if you look at bus first so
you know what you are getting. Pictures look to good and dont tell the
whole story. Will sell with blown motor also.
