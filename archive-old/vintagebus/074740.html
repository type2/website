Nope .. that isn't it because I don't have an emergency brake.  That is why I
have to leave it in gear.
Any other thoughts ?? The mechanic-from-hell decided when he was doing my $600
brake job, that
an emergency brake [heating - horn - temp gauge] was unnecessary and didn't do
the emergency
brake cable.

  Your emergency brake is sticking to the inside of the drum!  try not
sitting
  the emergency brake and curbing your wheels to keep from rolling!
  Don't leave the E brake on for too long as it could rust up tight
