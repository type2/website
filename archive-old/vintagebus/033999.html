Hi Dworkin,
Sounds like your main jet is too small or too big.  The latter could also be 
in conjuction with too big of an idle jet.  If your old carb worked well try 
using the jets from it in the new carb.   

&lt;&lt;It ran fine before the carb swap.  Well, actually, I'd sometimes get
similar symptoms when driving at night, after running at highway speeds
for a while.&gt;&gt;
We have had the same problem off, and on when the weather is cool, and the 
humidity high.  Wondering if it is a bit of icing occuring in the intake 
manifold?  With the sudden drop in RPM/high speed air movement the moisture 
has a little more time to form into ice.     Eric&amp;Barb
