Hello all,

I'll be there with my brother in the 63 hardtop deluxe.

If anyone has a passenger rear corner deluxe trim for sale and useable shape, 
I can pick it up there.

Thanks,

Dave Barnes

PS  I finally bought a house and can store all my VW's in one place. All my 
VW toys, books, parts have there own home.
Home ownership is such a grand thing!!!!!!!
