Subject: [VB] VW vs Porsche oil cooler

The 356 units are similar to the early VW coolers except for the top tab for 
tinware mounting.  Also some years received an aluminum cooler which is 
super sweet.

If I ran an early (non-dog) engine I would consider picking up a used 
aluminum 356/912 cooler and grinding off the tinware tab.

There was one on gar-bay a week or so ago, but I did not follow it to figure 
out the final price.

Later,
Adrian
