&quot;...I was attempting to squelch the discussion before it got ugly
again...&quot;

	Let me point out that everyone here was a &quot;newbie&quot; at one time or
another, to VWs and/or the internet. It's easy for us &quot;pros&quot; to get
jaded and cynical about anyone who happens on to the list, but we
shouldn't forget our days of not knowing as much, and of making more
mistakes than we do now and *appreciating* it when someone who had
experience politely helped us out or taught us a skill.
	I think the solution to this problem is going to involve stressing the
importance of copyright laws severely in the initial e-mail from the
listserver, so that everyone knows what not to do concerning that
subject... and so that noone will have to continue their martyring
off-list &quot;copyright law&quot; private e-mail campaign every three weeks. I
say &quot;off-list&quot; because, with the exception of the Vana*on Archive
Dispute, I haven't noticed anything on the list much/at all about
copyrights since I came on here last winter/last year sometime (?).
	Getting pissed off and feeling hate is really not very constructive
here. It's like... if you meet someone who doesn't know the accepted
regional pronunciation of &quot;Willamette&quot;, do you rant about how stupid
they are, or give them some mild instruction in local phonetics and
accomplish something? The &quot;dissatisfied elitist&quot; image doesn't present
itself well to out-of-towners or to new listmembers, who might have
something to add or gain to the list if the behavior around here is
semi-friendly. I think we'll get better results by guiding people away
from mistakes than we will by flaming them in an attempt to squelch
discussion. 
	Most people here would like the Sermons to remain available for all to
read. It is a masterpiece and compendum of Bob's experience...
priceless, and very helpful. When a few people jeopardize that privilege
for all of us, well, we need to realize that Bob Hoover is capable of
dealing with the problem himself, and that we have already had the
option of making a printed copy for our own personal use, thus making
the Sermons available to us individually forever &quot;until they pry our
cold dead fingers from around&quot; the Sermons... If you haven't printed out
a &quot;personal-use&quot; copy for yourself, as Bob has given you permission to
do, now would be the time to do so. 
	Even better (I believe) will be when Bob Hoover's book is completed and
available (glancing impatiently westward) for me to buy and read. I'd
love to know when we'll be able to order it... 
(hint, hint)...
