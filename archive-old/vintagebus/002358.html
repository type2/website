It all depends on your tolerance level. To me, yes. I wouldn't want to tear
down the engine for the price of a set of jugs. I would replace them even if
there wasn't a groove. However, there is another point of view that says a
new set of rings and you're good for another couple of thousand trouble-free
miles. Those with that point of view are what keep my garage from filling
with used P/C's. To me, every time the engine is stripped to the case it is
at least going to get new exhaust valves pushrod seals, and P/C's. I'm not
big on roadside rebuilds. If we all liked the same things, everyone would be
married to your mother. YMMV

&gt; But on the first one I cleaned I notice there's one vertical groove that's
&gt; just deep enough that I can feel it with my fingernail.  Barely.
&gt;
&gt; So... Junk or not?
