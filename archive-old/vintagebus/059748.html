Subject: bus sighting in MA

Hi All,

Yesterday morning around 8 am, I passed a nice looking pre62, dove blue,
panel(?) on 'West' St near the intersection with 'Lowel' St. (or is that
38...) in Wilmington MA.  Anyway, I waved, they waved... but I was in some
lame rental...  damn I wish 'Dollar' would rent *cool* cars....


David
