its all about priorities. the sooner i can pay off all my bills, the
sooner i can have extra money each month to do a full restoration on a
bus.

oh, and thanks for the &quot;dis&quot;.  
just because you dont like cal lookers, you think noone does?

&gt; just curious Eric.....how can you stand to go from:
&gt; &quot;an *original* unrestored westy in very good condition&quot;
&gt;  ....to....
&gt; &quot;71 pan (for the irs), ghia disk brakes, set of Porsche alloys, full velour
&gt; interior, filled dash with custom vdo gauge set&quot; ?
&gt; 
&gt; Besides the fact that its free or cheap, It seems like a very big change
&gt; that I wouldn't even wish on my worst enemy, even if he wasn't a vintage
&gt; nazi :)
