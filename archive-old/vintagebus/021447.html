&gt;Hi Jim,
&gt;If you have a copy of the VW shop manual you probably can figure out how they
&gt;go.  Otherwise you are probably best off looking for a local bus owner who
has
&gt;thier seals still in place for you to use as a pattern.  Eric &amp; Barb

Hi Eric and Barb,
I have a very original 66 bus, all rubber is square with a groove in the
middle.  I have a 55 shop manual and a 63 shop manual, neither show different
types of rubber.  When I pulled the rubber out of my 58 bus before it went to
the shop, I made note that all the rubber was the same grey square type(but
with out the groove).  I have replacement rubber for the 58, and it has many
different rubber shapes (triangles?).  Jim is not crazy, I think a lot of the
reproduction parts contain things that are incorrect.
In looking at my 1961 type 2 parts list, I found the following information
about door rubber.
Part number     Description
211 831 711    weatherstrip - door, front, lower (length 780mm)
211 831 721    weatherstrip - door, upper (length 1460mm)
211 831 725    weatherstrip - door, rear, lower (length 540mm)
211 841 825    weatherstrip - door, lower (length 1170mm)
Placement is simple, the upper rubber extends from the top hinge to the middle
of the rear of the door.  The lower rubber follows the top of the dog leg.
The front rubber covers the hinge areas, and the rear rubber fills in the rear
portion that the top rubber did not cover.
I hope this has cleared the front door rubber questions for you Jim, all
rubber is square.  I don't know what to tell you about the tri angle shaped
stuff, it is not factory.
