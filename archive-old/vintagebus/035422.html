&lt;&lt; Anybody have any advice on how to remove spray paint from plastic knobs?  
PO 
 painted the interior of my bus gold, including the vent flap knobs, and the 
turn signal knob.  They used to be ivory, and I want to clean them up, and I 
figured a wire brush would scratch those pieces up, and I'm not sure if 
certain solvents might react with the plastic.  &gt;&gt;
Hi Mike,
Try 3M &quot;Safest stripper&quot; at your local hardware store.  This stuff works 
great on spray can paints, and if used correctly will not remove original VW 
factory paint on the body!
