&lt;&lt;  need to get one of my 54-55 round regulators rebuilt, does anybody know
 of a place that can perform this feat?  My local generator rebuild place
 said there used to be a place in Tucson, AZ but they went out of business.
  Apparently a wire broke internally in my generator and fried it.
 
 Or if anybody has a NOS/New one, please let me know.
 
 Visible in this pic for those wondering what it looks like:

  &gt;&gt;
anyone have a way of testing regulators w/o hooking it up to a running 
motor/generator?

inquiring minds want to know
