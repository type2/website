Subject: Re: [VB] Re: Gas Guage, Horn?

I had a 71 tank installed into my 64DD. Be sure to seal off the breather 
tube at the top. Be sure to obtain the filler spout and hose from the late 
model donor.  I also took the straps off the donor bus with the felted pads. 
You may have to dimple out the area around the exit tube at the bottom and 
it is a tight fit pushing it into place. The pics from Thom are right on. 
The extra driving range is nice. BTW, what is a BN4? is that the reserve 
tank valve? My late model split didn't have that.

Good luck,
Chris

&gt; Also has anybody done the late Bay bus gas tank conversion? I've seen the 
&gt; &quot;How To&quot; on the VB site but I have some question about hooking up a BN4 
&gt; with the late gas tank. Anybody have any good insight? I figured it would 
&gt; involve having another outlet brazed on to the tank in some fashion.
