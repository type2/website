Hi list,

No part number yet but I have a price. Bought retail from a Mercedes
dealership here in South Africa the headlight units run under $100 each
without freight. This is for a complete fluted lens assembly with seals and
bulb in 12 or 24 volt. I think these are what you guys in the States call
'euro spec' lights.

The downer is that these are set up for right hand drive vehicles so they
may not be legal in left hand drive vehicles. The fluting aims the beams so
that they are more concentrated on the right side of the road.

Once I get a Merc part number I will post it. If anyone would like me to
hook them up with a dealership here in South Africa I will happily do that.

Later
Michael
