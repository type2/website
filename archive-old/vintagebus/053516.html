Subject: RE: [VB] Throw-out fork question

Just did this.

Make certain you have the right shaft, the later Bays had a shaft very
similar in appearance, but the arms did not go all the way around the
central shaft. This shaft seems to fit, but untrusting of function.

Make certain you have a good bushing on the pass side, and that the
shaft is greased into it, moving freely.

You either have one of two bushing styles, a brass one, or an aluminum
thin one, with two rubber ribbed bushings. Check the screw to make sure
you are on target and not binding. Also make sure spring is up to job, I
recently got a rebuilt trans with a wasted spring making clutch pedal
NOT return from floor.

Out side the trans, you get a dust cap, the spring, the arm (don't mount
spring to arm yet!) Then the clip.

Then mount spring to arm with a small screw driver, making sure not to
keep popping off the arm with the sideway spring pressure (this can be a
real pain) Filing the clip groove slightly on recently zinced arms can
help for a better fit. Some early shafts don’t seem to have the ribs for
the arms grooved as well as the shaft, like the late 59-60x HD shaft.

Some shafts have two grooves near the center on driver's side, if you
use the wrong one, alignment is fun. Make certain the throwout arms are
equal distance from the input shaft for a centered TO bearing.

Use the late TO clips with the full circle, so you can safety wire them
into the TO, so you don't have to mess with it later. This works great!

Subject: [VB] Throw-out fork question

After a search of the archives I have failed to find an
answer to my problem...Big nut tranny in my '59 DC:

I am replacing the throw-out fork and cannot get the
snap ring to seat in the shaft's groove inside the bell
housing. The fork is all assembled with bushings, set
screw, clutch cable arm and spring. I can't get the fork
shaft pushed into the the trans far enough to expose
that groove to seat the snap ring.

Could I have a shaft that has the groove in the wrong
place or am I assembling something in the wrong order??
I only am about an 1/8&quot; shy.

AArrgg!
