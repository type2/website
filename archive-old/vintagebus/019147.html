Along these same lines, has anyone used the 3 point dolly approach?  This entails making a single caster dolly that mounts to the tranny horns in back(with about a 1 foot extension between the mounting angle iron and the caster).  In front, basically the same caster approach, except that a plate is bolted to the front beam frame locations (one for each side)and it (the plate) is welded to a notched pipe or square tube that is welded or bolted to the large caster.

I was planing on building these with bigger rubber tires so I could roll it in and out of my rough drive way.  I've seen these on a few busses, one which was even loaded on to a flat bed tow truck.  Any comments from users??
