In a message dated 98-11-24 00:32:49 EST, you write:

&lt;&lt; Clean the flywheel and pressure plate with rubbing alcohol.  The
 friction plate cannot be cleaned as oil or grease will soak into the
 friction material.  If it's one greasy fingerprint don't worry about
 it. If it's soaked in oil then get a new friction plate.
  &gt;&gt;
Hi George,
We use a product called Brake Kleen on both our brake shoes and clutch discs
when affected by oil.  This product gets out all of the grease/oil from the
friction material and we have found that it will drop instantly wasps when
encountered in the junk yards.  Eric &amp; Barb
