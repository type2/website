It sounds like you have a 34 pict 3 K-Cal carb, these are carbs for
California cars and have a different size main jet then all other Solexs,
this was done so people can't change the main jet (for emissions)'

Hi all renoir here.
I want to increase the main jet size in my 34-3 carb.
1600dp,009, electronic ignition.
I purchase a 140 and a 145 but when i take out the main jet, that puppy is
small.
Question?
Is my only option to drill and rethread?

thanks all.
renoir
