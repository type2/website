Subject: RE: [VB] bolt specs

Over the past 28 years I have tried several methods. In the beginning I
was doing a lot of 40 hp motors for bugs and Super Vee. During that time
I purchased the correct studs from my local Nut and Bolt place, Tacoma
Screw. They also had timeserts that were 22mm long and were actually the
same as was used for the 10mm case savers (12mm on the outside coarse
thread). The problem I had with the was that they took too much meat out
of that area to drill and tap for the 12mm thread. I started using the
10mm X 20mm helicoils and that saved a lot of strength in the block. I
still use the helicoils for the tranny mount studs and the timeserts for
the head studs.

  I have a motor im working on (the stock sp for the 67 delux) that has
apparently the bottom two (mounting) bolts (you know the two poking out
you
use to put the motor in) that are apparently damaged. I got new studs,
they
dont really go in right or take any tourque (whichi is probably why they

were missing, yeesh). Are these 8mx1.0 pitch holes (in helicoil or
timesert
terms)?. Which is better for this application. (i want to drill both out
and
redo them). I found a timesert kit that has 8x1 thats only 11mm long
tho, i
think this is the only thing offered (nothing longer).
