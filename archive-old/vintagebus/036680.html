Subject: 'Equus' brand gauges Q.

Hi list,

I would like to get a set of VDO gauges(oil temp, oil pressure and tach) for
my bus but down here in deepest darkest South Africa VDO products are a
little rich for my blood.

Does anyone have experieince of a cheaper brand called 'Equus'? These are
available from the bigger Flaps chains here and they cost about 40% less
than the VDO items.

TIA for any info.

Later 

Michael (60 doublecab)
