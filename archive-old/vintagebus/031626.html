If I remember right, I think I found Yokohama Geolander come in 215 and work
great on my 1963 Double Cab... but it has been 2 years since I purchased
them (Discount Tire).  I think someone once told me that Honda SUV's came
with this size and that was why they were around.

On the 14&quot; front Bridgestone is great at 185 size too.

Hey, doing a search on Google I found this great german site:

I didn't study it that close, but seems to be organized pretty well.

So what kinda load rating am I lookin' for on the 60 standard with 15&quot; rims.
I had 235/65/15's on there but I wanted a 75.  So I searched and searched
and even searched some more but I could not find an LT tire in 205/75/15
best I could find locally was a P tire with, I think,  a load rating of 1596
lbs. Am I a  blow-out waiting to happen?

jdd 60 std
