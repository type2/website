Subject: Bus sightng- 57ish kombi in Oly

very odd- thought I knew all the buses in town- but when I went out last 
night I saw a very shiny dove blue kombi - no pin stripes- with pointy turn 
signals, stamped front bumper, high hinge cargo doors, no rear bumper, a 1600 
style header muffler, center brake light, bump taillights but no reflectors.  
 I was stopped on Division when they were taking Harrison downtown.  Anyone 
know who that was?  Looked like a fuzzy headed dirty blonde haired guy.
