Subject: RE: Dying at speed

You don't mention checking your fuel pump pressure, or the filter inside
it. Also, is your filter between the pump and the tank?  I remember a
thread awhile back where somebody said a fuel pump doesn't like to suck
through a filter.
    How about your accellerator pump volume?
Hope this helps.
