Subject: Fixed a starter bushing tonight.

This evening I've been prepping for the test fire of my 1776 engine which
hope will take place Sunday evening.  I've got the battery on the charger
and the busted tranny housing which I use to crank the engines is ready to
go only this time with a different starter.

Before, this housing had an autostick starter in it.  Since the housing is
on &quot;permanent loan&quot; from a friend of mine (he has no room to store it so I
get to keep it but when he needs it he comes to me), I'm subject to a few
surprises. How so?  Well, his starter bushing went out in his tranny and he
didn't want to pull the engine again.  I told him about the autostick
starter trick so he pilfered the one off from the housing and left me with
his old one.  Well the bushing was visibly shot when I put the manual tranny
starter in so I drug out the bushing box as I call it.  Anytime I have a
cylinder of about any size and material, it gets put in a little box.  It's
full of pipe fitting, scrap copper tubing, valve guides, etc.  I happened to
have a brass fitting that was close in size to the starter shaft but the
ID/OD was too small.  Surprise surprise though - I found a steel collar that
press fit around the brass tube.  All I had to do was get out the calipers
and find out that a 7/16&quot; drill bit is about .005&quot; bigger than the starter
shaft.  So I drilled out the brass tube with the steel collar on it,
hack-sawed off the length I didn't need, and using an old valve guide I
press fit into the tranny housing.  I swabbed some grease in it and bolted
up the starter.  After hooking up the wires, I fired up the starter and let
it run to distribute the grease and kind of wear things in.  All in all that
starter shaft doesn't wobble anymore!  This isn't a fix I would do on an
actual vehicle (I prefer to get the actual part) but it was fun to do it for
the first time and improvise at the same time so as to learn how it all
works.
