Subject: high mileage engines

[snip]
&gt;From what I have read and seen, very few Western states 
&gt;people really drive there buses that much or any long 
&gt;distances on a regular basis.

Bah, I resent that! 
 Lisa and I put a LOT of miles on our previos bus. 
Unfortunatly our odometer gave out while on our 
circumnavigation of north america so I don't know exact 
milage. I do know that we burned 635.4 gallons of fuel 
which would put us around 12,700 miles in only 3 months 
on that trip alone.
 Now I drive this EVERY day:

 It also hauls tools, parts, manure, furniture, and 
stuff my brother and father can't seem to fit in their 
fancy Ford Expeditions. Lisa, Emma (our 10 month old) 
and I also camp in it at most California VW shows.
