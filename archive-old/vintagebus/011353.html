&gt; Raise/lower the jack under the engine, so you are clearing the rear

line

&gt; again.

I always take out the tranny with the engine.  Is it really any easier
to prop the thing up and juggle everything?

&gt; Now...a quick RFC.
&gt; 
&gt; when I started working on VW's, I was told by a very competent
mechanic
&gt; that whenever one uses an extension on a torque wrench, to set the
wrench
&gt; to 5 lbs higher than you would normally.  5 lbs for each extension.
&gt; 
&gt; Later, I asked him about deepwell sockets.  He looked at me for a
minute,
&gt; then said he saw no reason to change for them.  the 5 pounds is not
for
&gt; the length, but for the flex that happens in each socket joint.
&gt; 
&gt; I've been using this for a few years now with no noticed
problem...anyone
&gt; have any comments?

I am loathe to disagree with experienced mechanics, but now and then
their wisdom doesn't ring true.

The torque on one end of a shaft is equal and opposite to the torque
on the other end.  In a static situation (such as a torque wrench) it
doesn't matter if the shaft flexes or not.

Extensions do add inaccuracy to the torque, as they add to the
opportunity to change the length of lever arms, input secondary
torques, etc.  If you must use extensions, be sure that they stay
straight, at right angles to the wrench, and that you don't apply any
twists to the wrench or extensions except for that through the handle.
