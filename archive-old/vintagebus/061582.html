Subject: Re: [VB] Seattle vintage weekend


The SIR show has been put on by a different group, unaffiliated with the 
cascade Kombis.

What I heard Tuesday at the last club meeting is that SIR changed hands and 
there is no Bug show this summer, but I have only vague info.

There is a event at BowWow and rally on the Sunday.  The Burger Meat on 
Friday is pretty cool.

for info

&lt;&lt; Can anyone provide info about the Seattle vintage
 weekend? I ave been to the Cascade Kombi's website, so
 I am aware of the Burger Meet and the Vintage show
 Saturday, but I have not been able to find any info
 about a show on Sunday at SIR. Is there one on Sunday?
 It's a long way to drive a bus for a one day thing and
 I'd like to know beforehand if it's gonna be worth the trip.
