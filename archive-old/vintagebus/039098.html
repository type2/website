I know exactly how you feel. When I built my first Must_at_ng, a 66, I drove it
all over. One day I went around a corner at about 20mph and I saw a sliver
streak rolling away from my car(the wheel). At the same time the brake pedal
went to the floor and the steering locked up. I spun around a few times and
landed on a center island. Turns out the spindle just snapped. bearings were
fine when I checked them in the wheel(which was about 1.4 mile away) and it
was cool to the touch so it wasn't heat. Mustang guru I showed it to guessed
at a stress crack from age. I got the car fixed but was scared to drive it
for a while. When something happens like that with no warning or way to
prepare it freaks you out. You'll get over it but it will be in the back of
your mind for a while. VW content= I had a similar thing with my 67 ghia
vert. While towing it I lost a wheel. That wheel managed to make a curve
onto an on ramp for a highway and rolled down the road for a long time. Can
you imagine driving down a highway in the right lane and having to yield to
a wheel trying to merge into traffic? That though made me laugh as I ran
across 3 lanes in rush our to get the wheel off the divider.

OK. So you may or may not remember, 1 1/2 weeks ago I had the lugnuts on my 
front driver's tire back out and the wheel came off when I was driving my 
'59 Kombi. Luckily I was going about 20MPH and no one was hurt...except my 
bus. The dogleg got all bent up and the drum  was bent a tad out of round.

Well, I got my drum turned from an old guy here in town who is &quot;the 
master&quot;...for $7.50. Great job too. I cleaned and greased all the bearings 
and put it all back together. I ended up pulling the drum on the other side 
and doing the same thing over there. I adjusted the front brakes and 
tightened up the emergency brake. So everything SHOULD be fine.

But now I find myself nervous and uncomfertable driving. I keep waiting for 
something to happen again. Having a wheel come off was pretty intense...and 
I can't seem to shake it.

Is this gonna go away? I feel good about my work, but I'm just nervous for 
some reason. Anybody else ever have this?

I had planned on driving from San Angelo to Ennis for the bug-in on may 
6th. I think it's about a 500 mile round trip drive. I'm gonna do it 
regardless...I just hope I can &quot;get it together&quot; so I can enjoy the drive.
