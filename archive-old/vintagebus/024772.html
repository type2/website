I have a '63 that at one time had a camper interior. PO must have
totally stripped out everything, including whatever was on the floor.
Only the screw holes remain in side supports where there must have been
panelling of some sort. Vehicle has the jalousie windows. The only clue
to &quot;camper's&quot; origins are a sticker on the inside of the cargo door
which reads &quot;Sun Valley Mobile Products, Sun Valley, CA.&quot; Has anybody
heard of this outfit? If so, did they do camper interiors or only the
windows? If they did the interiors, does anybody have pix?
Bob, in northern Calif.
