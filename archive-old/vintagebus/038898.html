This ad just came out in the on-line edition of local paper yesterday:

---
1956 VW 23 Window Bus, complete, but apart, very rusty, semaphores, $2,000 206-789-6800 jwworkshop_at_aol_dot_com
---

I went over and took a look at it yesterday.  I'm no old bus expert, but here are my observations for what they are worth (after an extensive 5 minute examination):

The current owner just bought it.  He has an automotive shop and uses a 71 SC for a shop truck, but seems to work on Porsches and older American cars mostly.  He bought it from one of his customers who had it in a barn/shed where it had been sitting for many years.  It very complete &amp; original pretty complete when he got it and he's stripped it to begin a restoration and then got discouraged when seeing the rust.

It has a rusty roof along the drip rail on both sides including a 1 baseball sized hole.  The rust extends upwards to a couple of the top windows.  Also the cargo floor is rusty under the rear seat with a few baseball sized holes.  The bottoms of the cargo doors were somewhat rusty and a little tweaked as I recall, but he has a set panel doors that could be used as donors for repair.

I can't recall seeing rust anywhere else except for the rockers, but that sorta goes w/o saying.  The cab floor is perfect along with the doglegs.  The rest of the body looked very straight, though I can't remember spending much time looking at the nose as it was pretty clean.  Didn't look at the battery tray.

The good news is that it is very complete.  All the original interior is there (including the middle seat) but needs to be redone.  The sliding sunroof and all hardware, original motor (a bit rusty - supposedly &quot;ran when I parked it xx years ago&quot;).  The brake light deck lid is there and even the rubber floor mats looked pretty good.

The semaphores are there along with the European fluted headlights.  It is missing the section of jail bars that attach to the rear hatch, but the rest are there.  He's taken all the glass out, but said it is all there (It'd be hard to count to 23 even with taking my shoes off, so I took his word for it).  The rear bumper wasn't there, but the previous owner thinks he has it and will look for it.  The front pressed bumper is there, though a little tweaked.

Oh and you get these really cool 8&quot; round RV tail lights in place of the stock ones &lt;gag&gt;.  That is the only non-stock item I noticed.

I was pretty tempted to get this bus.  I think it is probably worth more in parts than he's asking for it, but I've seen much worse vehicles restored.

If I wasn't going down today to pick up my new bug project (57/rag/semaphores) I would have grabbed it.  But seeing as how I've grown used to being married these last 21 years, I thought better of having too many projects around the house at once (my wife is only slightly amused that we keep the old VWs in the garage, but the &quot;nice cars&quot; have to sit outside).  

That's all I know about it (and then some).
