Subject: RE: [VB] My new tires and wheels

&gt;205/70/15 Pirelli Scorpians look and work great. They have a load range of
1525 &lt;

Are those the LT load &quot;C&quot; tires?

Most people are selling the &quot;P&quot; tires and I have found that the &quot;LT&quot; are
hard to find.  

The tires look awesome so please report back as to how they perform.
