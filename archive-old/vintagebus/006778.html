Drove the cattle truck (side loader single cab) to work today to fix all the
little things that need attention, leaking axle seals and a brake
adjustment, plus to do a full service on it. I must admit that it runs like
a sewing machine, even my wife was impressed (that's saying a lot). Upon
further inspection I noticed that it has the original spare tire
(Contenental) that was used way out of balance and that it only came with 1
drivers outside mirror, no holes inside for a mirror and the original pin in
the passenger door, the PO's did hack in a late glue on interior mirror
which I will remove and I will add a passenger side mirror for safety sake.
The bias ply goodyears need some miles to get rid of the flat spots of
sitting on them for the last 30 years and a good coating of glyceren, they
aren't cracked so I'll try to use them (except on a road trip) I will use my
extra set of 15 inch wheelsand tires. I'm also going to repaint the bumpers
as the PO painted them black and do some other detail work on the bus, looks
like it's going to be a fun one and got more looks in it then when i drive
my DD.
