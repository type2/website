Subject: Re: [VB] Gauge placement (overhead?)
To: dfmartin_at_mindspring_dot_com, vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

I have the VDO 3 gauge holder (black and made of hard rubber or ??soft 
plastic) mounted upside down just above the sun visor directly in front of 
me. I required a compound miter cut to get it to fit onto the wood paneling 
of my Westy. Because I am tall, it is just above my vision and easy to see in 
my peripheral vision. Wireing went up inside the left side post, including 
the dash lights in the gauges. I have a Tach, Oil Pressure and Oil temp. 
Works for me. 
Keeping the backs of the gauges dry in wet weather, as well as the distance 
from my central vision, got me not interested in fresh air vent placement.
