Subject: Electrical Problems Solved!!  Thanks All

I solved my electrical problems with help of you folks on the list, and 
the archive.  After replacing the ground straps, sanding down the 
surfaces prior to installing them, things didn't quite work.  I had the 
wierd behavior of getting a negative voltage output from the generator 
(-9 volts).  So I re-polarized it for about 15 seconds and then 
reconnected everything.  The generator light goes out now, the voltages 
are positive and things SEEM to be working fine.   Hopefully they'll 
stay that way.   Thanks once again!

Chris
