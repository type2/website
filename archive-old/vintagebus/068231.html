Subject: RE: [VB] Tires, it had to be tires!

Cal -

GoodRoads on Commercial blvd, west of powerline knows tires...Dunno for sure
if they have the specific tire you speak of, but they are 'The Ones' that
would have it.  There used to be a VW guy who worked there too.  He left the
company though. Friendly folks, fair prices.

They are your best bet - K
