It has been awhile since I have posted a message so I figured I would
bounce an idea off the list.  I went outside to take the bus out when I
opened up the lid to check the engine.  To my dismay I noticed oil slung
all over the roof of the engine compartment and on the engine.  My mind
began to race and ideas were flying by like cars when I drive my bus on
the interstate :)  I cleaned all the engine parts of oil and debris. I
then started the engine and there it was, black gold flowing down from
the fan shrouding and the base of the carb.  Hmmm, my first thought is
that the seals on the base of the oil cooler are shot.  As I rev the
engine, the oil tends to flow faster and faster.  Maybe the pushrod tube
seals have gone bad?  When the engine is stopped, the oil flow also
stops.  This engine used to have non detergent oil and now I have been
running detergent oil since last year and the oil temps have never gone
above 200 degrees.  Any suggestions?
