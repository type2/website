Subject: Engine knocking
Date: Mon, 3 Jan 2000 12:48:41 +0700 

Dear volks,
I am Thomas from Indonesia with '74 air cooled micro bus. I had problem with
my friend 1.8 L air cooled engine.  Originally this engine is 1.6 L and
replaced with 1.8 L MAHLE boring and installed Weber 40 dual carburetor.
This problem coming when engine turn off, engine indicate knocking like some
gasoline still coming into it's cylinder.  I didn't use additional washer
ring between cylinder head and piston boring, compression ratio indication
is 9 : 1.  I didn't found electrical / mechanical shut off equipment at
Weber 40 like electrical shut off valve at Solex carburetor. Friends, do you
have any suggestion with our problem ?, is engine knocking had come due to
high compression ratio ? or engine knocking had come due to No shut off
valve at my weber 40 ?

Best regards,
Thomas
