I awoke Monday morning to the sounds of Neil and Mary Kay getting ready for
work, and George coming in for coffee and a shower (the singing shower,
remember?  George doesn't know 'the trick').  With all the folks around,
Neil and Mary Kay called in to say they'd be late, and we had a quick
breakfast of bagels and coffee (tea, Earl Grey for me).  It was surely going
to be a long day, and I had to get moving if I wanted to be home at a
reasonable hour.  Plans for the morning included a quick tune-up on the bus,
and somewhere along the way I wanted to stop and get myself one of them
new-fangled stroboscopic timing lights.  And if time permitted, I was still
tossing around the idea of heading up to the parkway for a &quot;top of the
parkway&quot; sticker.

It didn't take long for Neil to get ready, and soon after he and Mary Kay
were driving off to work in the 66 Deluxe. Not without Neil making one more
attempt to get me to stay another day though &lt;grin&gt;. That left the rest of
us hanging around the house for the morning, the drill being only to lock up
when we finally broke camp.  George left soon after, headed back to Georgia
I suppose, and I remained along with the couple in the big pickup/camper
combo.  While they were getting ready, I dove under the back of the bus for
my 2nd Valve adjustment of the trip (all slightly tight again) and when I
checked the timing, I was in for a real shock. Remember how Dave had set it
up for total advance with the light?  Well it worked out that statically,
this meant it was at about 20 degrees BTDC!!  Yowsa!  Surely that wasn't
right!  It must have slipped somewhere along the way, and maybe that's why I
was having so much trouble on the way to Neil's. I took my best guess on the
timing, and set it just before the mark on the pulley, which I believed to
be about 5 deg. BTDC.  It sure seemed to idle a lot better, and not smoke as
much after that anyway.  The RV couple it turns out would be heading the
same way for a while, so we decided to drive together to the rest stop just
before the Tennessee border on 40.

Well, it was a good idea anyway.. as it would turn out, I only succeeded in
making the bus worse.. I guess it really does need to be set that far BTDC
statically!  It was an ultimate struggle just to do 50mph, and the head
temps were up to their same old tricks.  What was really even more
frustrating, is that I got stuck behind some big ole' Mercedes Benz doing
about 40mph, and I could never get up speed on the downhills to make it over
the uphills because of them!  What #$^%ing jerks!  That Benz could have done
120mph without even blinking!   This was horrible, and there was no doubt in
my mind that if I tried to go up on the parkway, I'd die, or at least end up
with a bus like Danny Morganelli's. I limped into the rest stop well behind
the RV'ers, and immediately got out my 'engine stool' and the appropriate
tools.  The first order of business was that I wanted to switch back to the
stock main jet on the carb, since I was still getting a VERY black tail
pipe, and crappy mileage. Funny though, the plugs STILL looked like I was
running a bit lean, even in that thin mountain air.  I also bumped my timing
up to what I thought was about 15-20BTDC statically, and made a mental note
to REALLY monitor the motor for sounds of pinging and stuff.  With that
going on, the RV couple were busy making some breakfast, ands treated me to
a really awesome breakfast burrito!  WOW, that sucker was tasty!   It was
probably about 10AM or so by that time, and I needed to get moving again.
We said our good-byes, and I took off back onto 40, doing about 50
balls-out.

The motor sounded OK, and the going was a bit easier since the highway
between the NC border to about halfway to Nashville is mostly downhill.
When I got to Knoxville though, I decided this would be a good time to go
looking for a Auto-Zone or something to get a timing light.  I jumped off 40
and onto state hwy 70, which I knew from previous trip more or less runs
parallel to 40...  it also takes you through lots of little towns and
'strip-mall' area where I was sure to find an auto parts store or two.  The
1st place I tried was a K-Mart, who didn't have a light.  Then I went to an
Auto-Zone, where I had to wait in line for about 30 minutes to be told they
don't carry them anymore.  The clerk there said that I might be able to find
one at the Pep Boys about &quot;a mile or so&quot; down the road, on the left hand
side.  So I went off in search of the Pep Boys.  And drove, and drove.  And
drove some more...  About 10 miles down the road I finally saw it... on the
right hand side!  I swerve over, cutting off a few people, and nearly
hitting a truck that was in my blind spot (jeesh I miss my Deluxe some
times!) and into the Pep Boys.  There I found me a nice  gun-unit with a
dial for total advance and everything.  For hid unit, I had the privilege of
paying about 75$!!  Zoiks!  I was now OFICCIALLY over-budget on this trip!
I set my timing out in the parking lot, and it seemed to idle a bit better,
but the real test was yet to come.

I was rather enjoying the more relaxed pace of 70, so I decided to stay the
road for a while.  70 runs parallel to 40, even crossing it several times,
so I wouldn't be too far off course, and I could get back onto the highway
quickly whenever I felt.     I must have stayed on 70 for about 40 miles or
so, when an entrance to the highway presented itself, so I decided it was
time to give it a try.  I had been running nice and cool up 'til that point.
Once on the highway though, things changed...  The winds were picking up
again, coming from the south west, and hitting me in sort of a
frontal-broadside fashion.. winds are not my friend.  I was able to keep her
up to 55, but my head temps were running awfully high.  About 450-500
consistently.  And my oil temps were way up too. About 170 on my oil!
Anyway, I rode the highway for a bit, listening to my Tom Petty CD's, or the
truckers on CB...

I was about halfway between Knoxville and Nashville by then...  it was about
1:20 or so in the afternoon.. clouding up a bit..  I might just get rained
on for the first time in this trip I thought.  At that point, it will be
important to note that I saw a particular hitch-hiker on the highway.. I had
seen many on the trip, but pay attention to this one.. he's important to the
story..  He wasn't a dirty bum type as the others were, this guy was
sporting a crew-cut, big hiking boots, and a giant metal-framed backpack,
walking with his thumb out.   I didn't stop for him, but he did stick in my
mind...   Sometimes I will pick up the occasional hiker..  Good karma I
think.  Once when my bug ran out of gas, an older gentleman stopped for me
and he was even running late for a flight at the airport.  It would have
taken me about 2 hours to walk to the nearest gas station, and this guy
saved my whole evening!  He even offered to drive me back to my bug, but I
declined, telling him he'd better get going.. I could just call my
girlfriend for a ride.  So, I have vowed to return that favor as often as
possible.. this time though, the mood just didn't strike me for some reason.

Shortly after seeing the hitch-hiker, I stopped at a rest area for some
lunch and a quick nap.  I also checked the weather on this little computer
terminal thingy they had at the rest station.. pretty kewl!  When I awoke
&gt;from my nap, it had clouded up pretty good, and had actually started to
sprinkle a little bit.  It was actually the sprinkles coming in through the
hatch which had awaken me.   It was goin on about 3:30 by then, and I got
and got going.  About an hour or so down the highway, what did I see?  That
same damned hitch-hiker!  He sure was making good time!  I continued on
struggling along at about 50mph.. those winds sure were brutal!

I arrived in Nashville just in time for the evening rush hour.  Thankfully
though, I was heading into the city, so for the time being it was clear
sailing.  Just before the major downtown area, I stopped for gas.  I was
only getting about 16mpg still, which had me pretty steamed.  The crappy
mileage I was getting, and the extra expense of the timing light had me over
budget for this trip by a long shot...  a pretty serious deal seeing as how
I'm unemployed and all.  I checked my oil, transferred some snacks and
beverages up front (Cracker Jacks and Vess!) and went on my way.  Just
before my turn north onto highway 24(?) &lt;I'm too lazy to look at a map right
now&gt; Guess what I saw?  THAT DAMNED HITCH-HIKER AGAIN!!!!  Man, he was
making better time than me it seemed!  This was the THIRD time I had passed
him today!  I was VERY tempted to stop just to find out what the heck was
goin on.. I'm sure he noticed me too...  getting passed by an old, slow VW
microbus 3 times in one day is not something that goes un-noticed..  It was
like a Twilight Zone episode.. I half expected Rod Serling to pop up from
the other side of the bulkhead  and give a little prologue to my journey.

After I made my turn north, traffic got pretty bad, and I was stuck idling
for quite a ways.. at least it gave my motor a chance to cool down though.
After about 45 minutes in traffic, it was clear sailing all the way to
Kentucky.  One of my favorite detours on the trip home from NC, is off the
highway and through the &quot;Land Between the Lakes&quot; area of Kentucky.  Being
just at dusk, I dodged off the highway and onto the state road.  Not only
was this a very scenic detour, but it also bypasses a giant bulge north out
of the interstate, and so it's a shortcut too!  Bonus!  The Land Between the
Lakes sure is breath taking.  The highway takes you over two *enormous*
suspension bridges, and I hit it just as the sun was going down on the
lakes.. wow, what timing...  at least for a while my thoughts were diverted
&gt;from my failing engine, the meltdown that was sure to come, and my preset
jobless condition.  Soon after that, it was back on the highway, and back to
the white-knuckled drive of the interstate.

About 9PM, I reached  Carbondale IL. And stopped for gas.  There, the gas
station attendant mistook me for a stink-foot, and I had to enlighten him as
to my thoughts on the matter (Jerry's dead, take a bath).  Since the turn
north however, I'd been doin much better on the temps.. I'd been staying
below 450 on the heads, and 230 on the oil, and I was able to maintain 55-60
pretty easily.... That wind makes all the difference in the world!  I was
getting 20mpg now, but just barely... still way to low for my taste.. this
bus driver ain't happy unless he's getting high 20's.  I bought myself some
Combos (addicting little suckers those are) transferred some more pop up
front, popped in a fresh CD. (The Cars greatest hits I think) and set off on
my way.  It was well into the night by then, and I entertained myself
watching all the bugs collide with my massive frontal area, and boogied up
the highway.  That same crappy stretch of highway I mentioned in the 2nd
installment of my saga.. this side is marked and circled too as if to
indicate impending work, but none has been done in at least 4 years...

An hour or so later, I was turning back west on highway 64, back to St,
Louis.  And as always, I was about 50 miles from the river when I smelled
it.. that rank, fishy 'river' smell St. Louis has.  Nobody believes me that
St. Louis has a smell, but spend a week up in the mountains and come back..
you'll smell it too.  It was just about that time though that I leaned down
into the infamous &quot;bus crouch&quot; and saw it...  Like beacons guiding me home,
the crescent moon lay directly ahead, to the left an up was Mars, as red and
bright as ever.. and to the right of the moon and just above the horizon was
Venus, glimmering that faint blue tinge.   My long-time desires to learn to
use an old-fashioned sextant were renewed at that moment.  I took a moment
to ponder sailors of old, using nothing but the stars and sun to navigate
their vessels, taking HOURS to get fixes on their positions in the rolling
waves.  And here I was, in the vessel of my day, with a hand-held computer,
and GPS receiver to give me  fix and bearing down the foot, AAA maps with
drive times, and exact mileage, and I wondered if some of the magic was
missing. I wondered if maybe I was somehow still missing the point of all
this wondering.  Does a man who makes the same trip in a new Pathfinder, in
air conditioning and seat belted air bagged harmony have any less valid an
experience?  The answer should be no, but something inside me says it really
is yes, that he misses out on the whole point.  Ever try to explain the
appeal of driving an old bus to friends or co-workers?  I know many of us
have faced those bewildered looks and snickers, and joke about old VW's at
work.  Maybe even from parents or family.   Some people just don't have the
capacity to understand that it's all about the TRIP, not the destination.
Ever tried to explain why you'd drive halfway across the country for a car
show?  See what I mean?  It is for these reasons that the end of the trip,
the getting back home to the St. Louis Stank is the saddest part, and not
the leaving your friends behind that you only get to see maybe once a year.
The most sobering part is always the realization that the journey is at its
end. I don't know what it is, but the world sure is a lot different when
viewed from behind that split wind-screen, with the humm of the motor, and
the drone of a pair of worn-out reduction gearboxes behind you, and feeling
every single seam in the concrete click right under your butt.  Maybe even
you get to enjoy some wind whistling through your vent wings, or water leak
in from the fresh air vent.  Some of us even get to watch the road go by
right under our feets!  I don't propose to have the answers or know the
meaning, but it sure is cathartic, don't you think?  There is simply no
other experience like it.  You are not simply an observer of the trip in a
bus, you are a part of it, and exchange of energies between your bus, the
magic that makes it go, and road passing by you.

It's about 11 PM when I turn off the highway, drive about a mile down
Kingshighway, turn onto my street and into the driveway.  The dog is so
excited to see me I'm surprised he doesn't spontaneously combust.  I unload
a few perishables from the bus, download a weeks worth of e-mail &lt;computer
must have crashed sometime during the trip&gt;. And then hit the sack to dream
sweet dreams of continuing on to the west coast....

I could elaborate more, but you all must excuse me...

The lawn needs mowing again.
