Subject: Light/dark Dolphin Grey for Deluxe?

Evening all,

Lately I have been thinking about colours for my
deluxe - getting close to painting the engine bay and must
decide on an overall colour scheme soon.  Originally bus was
beige grey and sealing wax red.  

If you're a purist stop reading now 8-)....

While I could go 'original' I've always thought
that the early cabriolet colours light/dark Dolphin Grey
L320/L321 would  look s**t hot on a deluxe with nicely
polished aluminium trim.  Light on top and dark below
of course.  Has anyone ever seen this sort of scheme
on a deluxe and if so what did you think?  What do
you think anyway?....................

Suiting up with O2 tank 8-)..
