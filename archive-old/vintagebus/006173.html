Subject: Baby Bus is home...

Hey all - the 1967 bus was successfully towed from Falls City, NE to
Beatrice, NE this p.m. - I just got home and she towed absolutely
beautifully all the way home.  My friends Shawn and Ryan rode in the bus
just in case something came loose so they could steer the bus to safety and
use the brakes if need be.  The tie rods are shot to the point where I think
the towout was creating the lack of tracking in the turns problem.  Ryan was
able to kind of nudge the wheel through the turns to keep the tires from
dragging.

Anyway, my new tires are on 'Baby Bus' (the p.o.'s name) and we changed the
rear end fluid which was actually pretty clear when we drained it.  Judith
gave me a bunch of papers and receipts for the bus (everything she had done
to it) plus a a book which details VW engine repair up thru 1963!!!  It's a
neat OLD book detailing the assembly of 36 h.p. engines.  I haven't looked
real close at it yet.

Judith also gave me the news that at the sale where this bus was sold when
her dad bought it, there was ANOTHER white over green bus with a seized
engine (get this) &quot;that was in much better shape than this bus.&quot;  When
Judith offered to give me the info of the guy who owned the bus, I jumped
and said yes!  She got in touch with the guy while I was working on this 67
and he said that he put the bus directly into storage when he got it in
hopes that his son would want it.  Well the son didn't want it for some
reason and so this bus is sitting in storage in southern NE or northern KS.
Judith said that they guy told her that, &quot;He would have to see if the guy
still has it - it's been in storage and he doesn't know if it's still there
or not.&quot;  Man, if it is - that has got to be one NICE bus if it's better
than this one.  Wow - karma karma karma.  To top it all off, my friend's mom
told me that there is a bus stored real close behind a house in Salem, NE
(real small town on the side of a hill - doesn't even look like a Nebraska
town that I'm used to seeing) and the old gal just won't sell.  I drove
through the town on the way home but was short on time so I didn't stop.
Not bad - 2 more leads to follow up on!!!

Well the one bus is sitting tire-less in the back yard (the 1966) so I've
got to air up these old tires from the 67 and slap on the 66 so I can roll
it around.  I think I pull the engine out of the 67 tomorrow and try to fix
the clutch and attempt to get her running.  That front end will need work
but nothing more than a steering box adjustment, greasing of the bearings,
and new tie rods.

Oh and one more thing while I'm in a VW tizzy here - I power washed the
lichens and crap off of Baby Bus and WOW - even though I found out she's
been repainted in the past, her white paint really shined up nice!  The red
will need buffing but this is one cool bus.  I hope to see you all at the
shows...
