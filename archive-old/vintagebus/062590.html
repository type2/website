Subject: Building dropped spindles

Hello,

Does anyone out there know how to build dropped spindles? I have the tools 
and metalworking skills but I don't have the money to buy a set. I have read 
about swapping the spindles from left to right and moving the controll arms, 
does this work?

Any help would be great,
Bob
