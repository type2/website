Subject: 25 hp valve grinding kit/ Locally made tools book...

Hey listees:

In my travels I have come across a gent who tells me he used to be a vw
mechanic several decades ago, and has one tool left of his former
collection: a valve grinder kit for 25hp engine. He is going to dig it
up and then offer it to me for sale. His details of it are sketchy.
Sounded like a lapping kit to me, but he says it is for grinding also. 

Anyone ever heard of this? Says it is a VW Wolfsburg-made kit, issued to
all vw mechanics in the 50's. 
What should I look for? What is it worth?

Question #2... Didnt someone have a copy of the local manufacture tools
book, and was going to copy it and sell copies? If so, who? and How
much? I would like one if anyone has info.

Thanks.


PS Off to Woodburn Dragstrip for the Bug-in there, few miles south of
Portland OR tomorow AM bright and early.
