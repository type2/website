 So, is &quot;below the beltline&quot; relative to the lower edge of the
 three-inch-or-so belt that runs along the sides of a bus, or relative
 to the upper edge?  I'm seeing some hints that an under layer of paint
 was done from the upper edge down, but the current layer is from the
 lower edge down.  Since I'm probably going to be getting the whole
 thing re-done, might as well get it done right....
 
 Thanks.

below the belt is yes under that belt around the bus/ V on the nose.   Yes 
there is generally a double layer of paint.  at some times they painted the 
bottom colour first  (including inside/dash) then the top colour.   THink 
around late 61/ early 62 they switched to paint all the bus the upper colour 
first, then the lower on top of the other.  Like my 65 westy would have been 
all blue white, thenm they sporayed the velvet green on top of the dove blue 
that was below the beltline.   my 61 hardtop deluxe got he opposite 
treatment- all SWR (including interior/dash)  then the Beige Grey upper half 
got sprayed over that, and where it is worn you can see the red underneath.   
This means it has a red dash and the upper part of the cab doors .  though 
the drivers door was replaced with a BG/SWR door from a 63 which had the 
paint done in the opposite and above the door panel it is BG, not BWR.
