I certainly could stand corrected, but I think that
the factory may have painted the entire bus one color
and then painted the upper color over the base color
depending on the Mcode as ordered/intended/determined
by the model.
                                                      
                         
I make this *assumption* based on seeing several
original paint buses with the white/whatever upper
color worn through to the base/bottom color.

Did I have the 67RFH painted this way. Um, no. Paint
was expensive enough as it was. It would be
interesting to know what really transpired at the
factory. That bus isn't correct anyway due to the
two-toned Westfalia in a US spec. I don't really
G.A.S. past a point about being &quot;correct&quot;. eg dated
stamped wheels and only German air in the tires etc.

If the upper color was in deed applied over the base
color it would inherently affect the final appearence
of that upper color vslightly~ esp if white or grey.
Call Charlie and see what he thinks and report back so
we will all know...

Have you noticed that the horizontal cut in the front
logo/emblem (between the V and W) is two-toned with
the exception of the all white buses? Emblem on that
color schema was the white of the bumpers and wheels.
Dont know about other single color schemes.
