 &lt;&lt; At what RPM do you change gears? &gt;&gt;
 
 Hi Rex,
 Except for first and reverse never go below 1,500 RPM and even in those two 
 exceptions you want to get it up to 1,500 ASAP without drag racing it.  Go 
 below 1,500 in second trough fourth gear lugs the engine and shoves the 
 crankshaft into the bearings!  For top cruise RPM we have found 3,000 RPM 
 gives best engine longevity, MPG and speed all at once.  This RPM only 
 exceeded for short periods to prevent going below 1,500 RPM when shifting up 
 a gear or trying to squeeze a little more acceleration on one of those short 
 and/or uphill onramps.  Though in outside temps over 80F dropping down to 
 2,500-2,800 RPM really helps to keep the oil temp well down below 230F. &gt;&gt;

enough already!  i cant take it anymore!  it is a simple damned bus, not a 
precision instrument.  just build the engine right, maintain it and drive it. 
 do you think they handed out thermometers at the dealer?  No!  &quot;uh oh honey 
its 79 derees better start thinking about slowing down&quot;.  They didnt come 
with some super complicated instruction manual that says under what 
conditions you had to do what.  i wouldnt worry about what thes &quot;experts&quot; 
say, they will make you scared to drive around the block.  &quot;dear, at this red 
light you better make sure that you have the engine at 1500 rpm before you 
engage the clutch&quot;.  you would think after listening to all this crap that 
driving to work was rocket science.  half the beauty of a bus is in its 
simplicity, lets keep it that way.
