Hello alll....This post isn't about anything other than the healing
power of my bus.......Everytime I come home, no matter how bad of a day
I've had or how bad of a mood I'm in. As soon as I pull into my driveway
and see my bus I smile. It totally lifts my spirits instantly.......It
just amazes me that my whole outlook can be turned around so fast. If I
could bottle whatever it is I'd be a rich man.........
Yesterday was a good example, The whole day at work sucked!!!!!! Well
when I got home and saw the bus things got better. Then we went for a
little cruise and life is good all over again..........It just seems to
help melt away all the junk in life and make things more clear.......

Never underestimate the medicinal power of a VW bus....I love it!  Life
is good.

See Ya,  Shawn
