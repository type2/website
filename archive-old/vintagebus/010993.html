Subject: Old guage/sender fun
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

Hooked up the wires to the sender and installed it. 

 It is really neat, the sender says VDO, 6V and max temp 120C on it.  3 
screws hold the two pieces of bakelite togther.  one half come off, the other 
half is attached to the dipstick (sender) and the wires are attached at two 
screw terminal bits in there.  SO I undid the old cloth covered wire that 
some one had cut off about 6 inches form the sender, and attached the black 
power wire I had run from the front of the bus, and a brown ground wire.    
tweeaked the wires so they fit through the gap in the end of the bakelite 
halfs and attached the cover with the three screws which I had carefully not 
lost.  tried to route the wires so  it was tidy and also they would not get 
melted on the manifold.

started up the bus,  and watched as the guage rose slowly from  just under 30 
C to 60C, where it stayed at idle.  Pretty cool. 

anyone know how many grease fittings there are on a 53 bus?  When did they 
come out with the metric system anyway?

Clara
