hi list,  
 I was just wondering when front bench seats changed. I've noticed some
where the seat back doesn't touch the seat bottom at all and they seem
like thinner seats. And then there's those you really have to push the
back down on to get it past the bottom seat part. Did they change when
the brackets changed from 1 to 3 positions, or was it before that ? And
how many different styles of front bench seats were there ?  TIA
