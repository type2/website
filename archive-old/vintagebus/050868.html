&gt; &gt; Hi Diana,
&gt; &gt; If you get chunks out of a RGB it is best to park it until you fix it.  
&gt; Those
&gt; &gt; can get real bad real fast.
&gt; Hmm...  well, ya, I think I'm running on my 9th life on this one, if you 
&gt; get
&gt; what I'm saying.  From what I understand it was spitting chunks even before
&gt; I got it, and I've put over 30 000 miles on it.  This summer, I promise.
&gt; Really.  Can I rebuild the reduction boxes myself?

Hi Diana,
You can if you have the tools, the arm strength or some helper with it, the 
Bentley shop manual, and if you have anything left to rebuild by then.

&gt; &gt;&gt;Otherwise your bearing rumble could be due to too big of diameter bore in 
&gt; the front drums for the outer race of the bearing/s.  Seen this happen due 
&gt; to badly machined new Brazilian drums.&lt;&lt;
&gt; Ya, that's kind of my suspicion, that one of the bearing races is spinning
&gt; or something, I seem to remember that drum had some weird &quot;issues&quot; when I
&gt; pulled it last year.  If I recall correctly, the part where the outer race
&gt; for the inner bearing seats had some chunks missing out of it that weren't
&gt; the same as the other side.  Or something like that: it's a bit hazy now 
&gt; and
&gt; I didn't have time to pull out that bearing this time.  I am pretty sure
&gt; it's the front wheel that's making the noise.  At least if the front wheel
&gt; on that side falls off I'll have matching wheel well damage on both sides.
&gt; Just kidding.
&gt; Anyway, thanks for the advice.  Diana

You are welcome!  Eric&amp;Barb
