&gt; That is not the style of living I want, so I don't move there.  It doesn't

If you want a new house in SoCal, try and find one that _doesn't_ have an
&quot;association&quot; dictating what you can and cannot do!  Developers love these
associations as they make sure that the first-sold houses look good until
the last ones are sold.  I ended up buying a 30-year-old house just so
that I could put up a few antennas and park my RV.
