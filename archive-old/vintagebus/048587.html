Subject: Strange VW based military vehicle

I really love to see the unusual vehicles that use the VW parts.  Over the
years I have seen air boats, air planes, crop spay rigs and a fully tracked
snow mobile that was manufactured in Canada that used VW parts.  But this
Friday, I am going to video tape a military vehicle that was built in the
50's that used many VW parts and even had a VW bus tranny with redux boxes!

The story goes, this vehicle was developed in southern California in the
50's and was presented to the military as an alternative to the Jeep.

It had many features that were superior to the jeep.  For one, it was fully
amphibious and could be connected together with others of it's type to form
a temporary bridge.  These vehicles look like a flat top bathtub.

They resembled a bus with the driver sitting in front of the front wheel
and the engine in the rear.

For transporting, these vehicles could be driven up on top of each other
and stacked four high..

There was one that used the Porsche four wheel drive unit that was sold to
someone in Florida.

The engine was modified to over 2,000 cc in the 50's using many hand made
parts.

The body is fully aluminum and built aircraft style with many rivets and
stiffeners.

I will give more details and pictures next monday when I return back to
school.
