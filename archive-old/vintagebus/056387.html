Subject: Re: [VB] How do you remove oil filler piece?

I gave up on that little POS tool with the two little dogs. They always slip
off, even when I tried using an impact driver. I spent $12 for the inside pipe
wrench made [sold] by EMPI just for that job. Well worth the bucks even if you
use it once! Only negative I have is it needs a stop, otherwise it goes down
past the steel collar and you dig into the aluminum.
If you can't find one locally, holler back and I'll loan it to you. [mail]

&gt; I've been trying to remove the oil filler piece attached to the
&gt; generator pedestal.  I tried using the special tool I bought from
&gt; Busdepot but the slotted ring won't budge.  Any ideas?  The engine is
&gt; out of the bus.
&gt;
&gt; Thanks,
&gt;
