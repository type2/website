&lt;&lt;Extensions do add inaccuracy to the torque, as they add to the
opportunity to change the length of lever arms, input secondary
torques, etc.  If you must use extensions, be sure that they stay
straight, at right angles to the wrench, and that you don't apply any
twists to the wrench or extensions except for that through the handle.
&gt;&gt;

I have to disagree with everyone here.  The length of the extension makes a
lot of difference in the amount of torque applied.  It increases the length of
the wrench, and thus the amount of torque.  The mechanic is wrong here, he
should be decreasing the amount of torque and there is a formula to calculate
this.

An example from the manual that came with my torque wrench.

How to obtain 90 lbs of torque using a 6 inch extension
A = 14&quot; (wrench)
B = 6&quot;  (extension)
D = 90 ft. pounds (amount of torque you want to apply)
C = unknown (where to set your wrench to apply 90 lbs)

 C = A/(A+B) x 90 or 14/(14 +6) = .7 x 90 = 63 foot pounds.

So using a 6&quot; extension on my 14&quot; torque wrench to apply 90 foot pounds of
torque would require the setting on my wrench to be 63 foot pounds.

It is also important where to apply your force on the wrench.  You want to
hold the wrench in the middle of the handle grip and not on the very end on
the wrench, or higher up.
