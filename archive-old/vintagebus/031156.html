Subject: Headliner

Hello,
I've been contemplating the replacing the headliner in my 62 for a 
little while now.  I've been hesitant to do so as it is the original 
cloth one, but its sagging pretty good in places, has a few good rips, 
and is stained/discolored now.  Anyone replace a cloth headliner before? 
  I'm sure someone has...  Whats the PITA rating on a job like this? 
I'm hesitant to do it because I just don't want to mess it up as the 
looks of the interior really depend on the headliner, and the bus would 
look *great* with a new one.  Any idea about how much it would cost to 
have someone do this for you?

Thanks!
Isaiah
