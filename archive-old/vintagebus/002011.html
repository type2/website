I am looking for the piece of trim that runs from the cargo door and around
the right rear quarter panel on my 67 Deluxe.  It is made of aluminum and
has a black plastic insert.  The condition of the plastic is unimportant to
me, since I will probably replace all mine anyway.  Thanks for any leads.
