&gt;  But seriously, the '67 Deluxe owner's manual might as well be the Holy 
Grail.
&gt; 
&gt;  No one selling auto literature on the Internet ever has one.  About once a
&gt;  year you may find one on eBay.  The last one I saw there was mint and sold 
&gt; for
&gt;  over $140.
&gt;  

be sure to get he right one- some had the back up light info, and some did 
not.
