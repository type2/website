Just a note to remind any on the left coast that the Jurassic Bug in
will again be held at Independent Bug Werks and Oregon State University 
in Corvallis, Oregon on Saturday July 24, 8am till 2 pm.

There will be some sort of friday night activity and limited camping
spaces available fri nite.

We will be charging $10 for a swap spot, $5 to show your car, and as
always, free admission to spectators and lurkers.

There will be door prizes, Hazet tools I am told, and lots o fun for the
whole vw family.

Portland's show is teh day after, so there will probably be caravans
heading out late saturday.

Hope to see you all there.
