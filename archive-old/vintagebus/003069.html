&gt;Has anyone thought about using scratch and abrasion resistant plexiglass or
&gt;lexan to replace a windshield?  Lexan (if thick enough) will stop a bullet.
&gt;
&gt;Feedback?????

Lexan thick enough to do all that won't fit in the seal. Reckon you could
caulk it in, that would have a certain Mad Max flavor to it. I certainly
have never found Lexan to be particularly scratch resistant, contrary to the
makers claims. I imagine it would look good till the first time you turned
on the wipers. Kind of pricey too. What's a windshield cost, around $30?
Wouldn't buy many plastic replacements. Unless you drive through gunbattles
real regular, I'd stick with the glass.
