Last night it wouldn't start, so I jumpered a wire from the starter 
solenoid to the back and touched it to the positive post in the home 
depot parking lot (someone on the list suggested this- the wire, not the 
parking lot).  it started immediately. Now I know what at least ONE of 
the problems is.  Also the ground strap to the tranny is shot.  I'm 
going to go through everything to put it back right.

Thanks to everyone who helped!!

&gt;Then go through the procedure I sent.Also if it won't crank still jump the big lugs on the sarter with channel locks as the solenoid may be the problem.

&gt;there's no cranking at all when it won't start.  and when it does start, 
&gt;it cranks really good.  and it sometimes starts after sitting for a few 
&gt;minutes.

&gt;&gt;Will it not start or will the solenoid not trigger?Will it crank and not fire or just not crank.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Check the chassis to trans bonding strap.It is under the bus at the front trans mount.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Check the wires at the starter,both the power and the trigger wires.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Check all connections in the starter trigger circut,starting at the starter main lug back to the fuse box through the light switch through the ignition switch and back to the starter trigger terminal.

&gt;&gt;I hate these electrical problems.  This is a wierd one though:
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Behavior:  Bus will not always start- not even a college-try from the 
&gt;&gt;starter.  If its going to start its got tons of juice, if its not, the 
&gt;&gt;lights come on, but there's no starter activity.  Last night I drove 
&gt;&gt;home, stopped the engine, then immediately tried starting it, and 
&gt;&gt;NOTHING.  Headlights were bright.  12.6 volts on battery.  belt tight. 
&gt;&gt;Then i disconnected the battery ground and went to sleep.  This morning 
&gt;&gt;it started right away with lots of power.  I even delayed pressing on 
&gt;&gt;the gas so that I could engage the starter longer until the battery 
&gt;&gt;pooped out, but it didn't.  I've also observed that if it doesn't start, 
&gt;&gt;I can walk away and come back in 10 minutes and sometimes it starts like 
&gt;&gt;nothings wrong.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Background:
&gt;&gt;'65 w/12 volt, '71 engine, New Battery, new starter, generator (2 yrs 
&gt;&gt;old bosch- not a rebuild), regulator (2yrs old bosch), new belt
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Tests:
&gt;&gt;12.6 on battery with engine off
&gt;&gt;13.5-14v with engine running
&gt;&gt;I removed negative battery cable and checked resistance from cable to 
&gt;&gt;negative battery terminal:  it appeared to be a short until i removed 
&gt;&gt;the generator harness, then when i put the generator harness back again, 
&gt;&gt;there was no more short.  Why would remove/replace the harness change 
&gt;&gt;the result?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;I think I'm in an altered universe where the laws of physics don't 
&gt;&gt;apply.  Could this be related to a botched polarization of the generator?
&gt;&gt;
