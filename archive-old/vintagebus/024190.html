Subject: Pulley 

I installed a stock pulley to replace a degree pulley.

As I tightened the bolt to fasten the pulley as well as draw the pulley
in, the pulley touched the
engine tin.  In addition, the belt was at an angle since the crank
pulley and the alternator pulley
were not lined up.

I wasn't aware that one could pull the pulley in too far.   Could I be
missing some spacers or
something behind the pulley?  The books don't seem to indicate that any
spacers exist.

I pulled the crank pulley out enough to avoid the engine tin and line up
the belt and everything
appears OK.

Do I have anything to worry about?

...Markus
