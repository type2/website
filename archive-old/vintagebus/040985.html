Yesterday I adjusted the valves and put new plugs, plug wires, Pertronix 40k
coil and Pertronix ignitor in my 1966 Deluxe 21-window bus with a 1600sp.
Once I got everything in and did the timing she purred like a kitten. I
drove the bus all weekend with no problems until this afternoon as I'm
driving along to work, I loose all power to the bus. No juice to the dash at
all, as if there wasn't a battery. With some help from a good samaritan, I
pushed the bus out of traffic, to a no parking zone, and hitched a ride to
work.

I think I must have fired a fuse somewhere but I'm clueless. Any thoughts or
suggestions on any quick easy fixes would be greatly appreciated. I have had
no problems with my battery recently and just a few minutes earlier, the
dash warning lights were glowing bright as ever when I fired the bus up.
BTW, she was starting first time every time!

Thanks,

Martin, Austin, Tx
