Heater tube.......

Go to local exhaust shop for the right lenghth for what you want todo....
I'm guessing 4&quot;, (School bus diameter) but I can't recall exactly. Anyway as
Michael said it is covered.... who is going to know....

Ordered one from at the time TABCO (does it still exist??) and that's
basically what it was.

&gt; he sell to the U.S.? It seems only RMMW offers a heater tube in the U.S.,
&gt; but it's only 36&quot; long and very expensive -- what's the deal? (I need the
&gt; whole straight tube, plus the angled piece just ahead of it that comes
down
&gt; from over the front beam.)
