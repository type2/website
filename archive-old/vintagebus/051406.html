Subject: mystery wire

Hey everyone,
I'm back on the list after a short break - I needed my veedub fix...  Just
finished two weeks of a pre-apprentice course in mechanics... got to do all
those things I've been putting off since the rain started in a nice warm
shop with lights and stuff - wow those little trouble lights are cool, I
should invest in one someday... mind you I'm used to going by feel anyway.

Getting to my point, one of my jobs was to pull out and seal the gas tank.
In doing so I noticed the &quot;mystery wire&quot;  It's black and wrapped in a black
plastic insulating tube.  It enters the engine compartment just over the
driver's side wheel well and goes under the gas tank (or just behind it) to
the other side of the engine compartment.  Now, of course I realize that
this is probably not stock.  But I'm curious just in case it is, as it
doesn't look like your average backyard job.

Happy bussin'
Diana
