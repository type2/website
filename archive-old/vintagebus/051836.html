Subject: Westy hitch

  Well, I searched the archives again and still could 
not find anything on the capacity of a westy style 
hitch.  
  I took a close look at Thom's picture of his hitch's 
tag and ran it through a translator. Apperantly it's 
an &quot;appendix device&quot; (Anhangevorrichtung) not a hitch! 
8^)
&quot;Total weight&quot; of 1100 kg (2420 lbs)
Another weight of 600 kg (1320 lbs) is also listed but I 
could not find a translation so don't know what it is 
referring to. It is too much to be a tounge weight 
rating. Anyone know German??
