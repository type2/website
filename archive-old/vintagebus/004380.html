Subject: Murray Goes Around the Block

After endless toil and strife, my '63 Sundial camper, Murray, starts up
every time and has brakes. It can now both go AND stop.

My wife got out of the shower, put on her big fur coat, we grabbed two hard
ciders and went for a ride.

The bus is in it's first coat of filler primer after 7 months of body work.
It has no bumpers, glass or interior. She sat on a moving blanket, as there
are no seats. I sat the bottom of the original seat, exposed springs and
horsehair sticking out. We got up to about 40 MPH, but with no rubber,
soundproofing, or glass of any kind, it gets pretty exciting, it's like a
carnival ride.

Murray conked out in the alley, about four houses from ours, but I leaped
out, opened the engine hatch, shook the gas filter, started him up again,
YAYYYYY! One of the reasons I love this rig is because I can pull to the
side and fix it. It's like an erector set. After miraculously healing the
bus we drove back into the garage. The wife is very impressed.

Tomorrow Murray will get a second coat of filler primer as well as the side
windows and the bumpers. While they are drying I will be changing out all
the fuses and bulbs. Wednesday, if I can avoid work I will put on the final
filler coat and start applying the three coats of white, two of tan and
three of clearcoat. I think I can avoid work until Friday, I'll go by and
leave evidence that I was there during the week. Then I'll have Saturday and
Sunday to get closer and closer to ...being done?

Nah. I'm not sure it will ever be done.

&gt; I've noticed that the shows towards the end of the year don't have
&gt; as much &quot;punch&quot; as the spring shows.
&gt;
&gt; And yes, the drag racing gets old, kwik.
&gt;
&gt; I chose to do something car-related, but a little different last weekend;

exciting,
&gt; &gt; unless you like drag cars and a lot of noise. The Facility was awesome
