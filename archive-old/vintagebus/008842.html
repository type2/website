&gt;So I wired this huge Christmas wreath to the front of the splitty. So
big
&gt;it comes almost to the headlights.
Did you seriously do this? Because I've been trying to figure out
where and how to attach a wreath to the front of my bus for about a
week now, like the one on the front of the Christmas cards I got from
Uncle Jerry and Melissa, and I don't know where to attach the thing!
Help! Only 7 days 'til Christmas, and I REALLY want a wreath! :-)
Thanks for happier thoughts.
Michele
