W/regards to the &quot;S&quot; curve. Do not do it. That will change the spring rate
of the studs to a possibly unusably low level. The studs work because they
are in pure tension. Once you put a bend in the studs, the stress is no
longer just trying to stretch the studs, but also straightening them out.
Other normal forces will be created too. I do not know the pressure
developed when the fuel ignites, but multiply that by about 9-10 times (
surface area of piston/head). We are looking at 1-2 tons. Picture your head
lifting  slightly with every comression stroke and a little more when the
air/fuel mixture ignites.

&gt; Another idea is that of making offset studs with a slight &quot;S-Curve&quot;
&gt; in them.  The offset isn't all that great and the studs are long so this
&gt; route might actually be superior to the machining options.
