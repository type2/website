Subject: RE: [VB] og hub caps

&gt; 'How can you tell original hub caps from those from Brazil, Tawain, etc'?



Bring them outdoors on a drizzly day and wave them in the air for several
minutes.  If rust forms by the time you put them down, they're aftermarket.
:-)

Seriously, one observation that I can pass on is that as I recall, some or
all of the Taiwanese ones lack the two little holes on the rim for the stock
hubcap puller.  So the lack of those holes could tip you off to an
aftermarket hubcap, although the converse is not true. (If it has the holes,
it still could be either original or aftermarket.)  I recall that there is
also a difference in the stamping of the logo on some aftermarket ones, but
don't recall the details.
