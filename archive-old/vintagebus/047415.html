&lt;&lt; which would be more correct for my 60 standard? &gt;&gt;
Hi John,
If you had a 36 HP or the stock Bastard 40 HP engine your should have had 
then the 28 PCI would be correct with it's 21.5mm dia venturi.  But it is 
sounding like you have a later 40 HP that requires a 28 PICT which has a 
22.5mm dia venturi.
