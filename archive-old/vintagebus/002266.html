I learned some more about the old bus steering boxes.  First of all, that
groove in the bottom of the steering box under the square plate is not a
place for an o-ring.  What I thought was an o-ring was just old gunk and
crud that had sat so long, it formed it's own kind of cruddy ring.  I found
that no matter what I did, I couldn't get smooth operation of the steering
box with the o-ring in place.  I read Bentley and it never said anything
about an o-ring down there but for some reason, I thought I had some one-off
box or a 67 last minute odd ball weirdo unexplainable box that for some
reason needed an o-ring.  Turns out, you seriously affect the endplay of the
steering wheel shaft when you try the o-ring thing.  All you need to do is
use a thin piece of gasket material down there (although my box had no
gasket material anywhere on a never-before-opened box! - just sealant of
some type).  I used the receipt from the steering box seal purchase to make
me a gasket.  And during my learning curve today, I opened the box up
thinking that I had sand or gunk in there someplace causing the binding of
the innards (which as mentioned above - later proved to be caused by my
o-ring trick).  I made a nice gasket to seal the halves and was relieved to
see that inside, everything looked clean.  There was just some semi-hardened
grease along the sides that I scraped out.  It was out of the reach of the
moving parts but I still took the time to pull that gunk out.

The end result after assembly, fluid fill, and adjustment is a box that
operates very smoothly.  I went ahead and put the body clamp on it and the
little lever arm thingamabob w/castellated nut and cotter key and threw the
works in a cardboard box on the shelf.  I'm glad that's over with.  Tomorrow
I'm going to paint the front sway bar and attempt to install the clutch,
brake, and throttle levers as well as reinstall the steering box.  This was
the stuff I pulled out last so it can be the first to go in.  The real fun
will happen next week as I try to reinstall everything back on the beam.
:-)

Thanks for reading.
