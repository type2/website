 Clara, aren't 53 inside dr. handles same as early bugs? with the
 rib down the middle? If so I see them all the time at swap meets for
 $5 to $10 each. If so I will buy them and list them. I might even have
 a pair in the swap meet box myself. Won't look till I know if they are
 the same.
  &gt;&gt;
did I say *inside* door handle?  What I want is the +outside+ door handle for
the drivers door.   The locking one.   It is a 53 and earlier bus only part,
and so would have an early style part number starting with 29-

Clara
