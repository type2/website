You are in the land of VW guru's. Here are just a couple &quot;professionals&quot; you
may want to check with
seek out Ken at the Bus Co. (kind of over by UW) he would be a great one to
start with. www.thebusco_dot_com
Ken is a good mechanic, as honest as they get, and he is also a list member.
If you are located a bit south you may check out Fred at Ovals Motor Sports,
he is also a good choice.
If the 67 is a solid bus and you can afford it then yes that seems like a
fair price.
Good luck
Shawn

hi! my name is thomas and i am new to the list and to vw's.
i have found a '67 bus in excellent condition. it has sat in a car port for
15 yrs-the body is amazing and the interior incredible. i just knocked on
the guys door and asked if he would be willing to part with it. he said he
would. mechanically what do i need to do to it if i bought it? and what is a
fair price? he said he would take $2,500 for it. i was thinking of offering
$2,000 and seeing what he says. it is a split window-i think a standard-but
i am not sure. does anyone know a good mechanic around the seattle area?
thanks!
thomas
