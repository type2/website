Subject: RE: [VB] Insurance for the Bus..&amp; dding a 16yr_old

  In AZ the insurance rates for kids are based on there grades in school (at
least by Farmers Ins). My 16 year old boy would have been 90 dollars for 6
months 3.5 or better grade point average. 35 dollars a month for C average
(or even 1 grade below a B), 100 dollars plus if he was a complete screw up.
  Any body with high school age drivers should ask about the good grade
discount.  The cheapest vehical for me to insure for him was my Station
Wagon (aka  VW BUS). I could put him on it as the primary, but he could
drive any of my vehicals. Adding the 5th one on my policy this week.

I just added my 16yr old stepdaughter to my policy
When I got the bill I found that my 63 singlecab had become $650.00 for 6 
months!!
This is more than the 98 Mazda, the 70 Westy &amp; the 85 cabriolet combined!
I called the agent and he said that adding her to drive my truck was the 
cheapest was to do it &amp; I should be glad that she was not a 16yr old male_at_!
So be warned insuring a 63 singlecab with a 16yr old in the house is not 
cheap!!
