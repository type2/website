Yes, I was kidding about that part.  The thought crosses your mind but I do know that it is not a realistic idea.  Just something you think of at 4:00 AM after turning the engine
                    over for 4 hours with a crecent wrench.  It has been about 8 years since I last clearanced a tranny that way and I am far too old and lazy to do it that way now.  I did hear about
                    a friend of mine who set himself on fire recently when doing this job, so if you are using a grinder, heed the warnings given and be very careful of sparks.

&lt;&lt; You do get tempted to just start the puppy up and then push it in.  
Probably not a good idea though.  &gt;&gt;
Hi Richard,
We to would advise against running the engine to do the work.  The 
aluminum/magnesium tranny case might just reach ignition point with all of 
the friction, and whoosh goes the VW.   Eric&amp;Barb
