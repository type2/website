Subject: Re: [VB] Blaupunkt Radio

Now, that I can do...
Blaupunkt will accept it for refurbishing.  It's not that much more than another shop.

However, another shop suggestion would have to be Pyramid Audio.  Pyramid is Not a specialized
service center for Blau, but with that old of a deck, I don't think they'd have all that much
trouble with it. Do not confuse Pyramid with the aftermarket audio company with the poor
reputation.  These people have NO connections to them.

&gt; while we're on the subject of blaupunkts, i have an late 60's early 70's 3
&gt; band that needs a new/replacement on/off/volume switch. everything else
&gt; works excellently, but when turned on, the volume is very loud and does not
&gt; get louder or softer. can anyone recommend a good repair shop that i could
&gt; call/email for this repair?
