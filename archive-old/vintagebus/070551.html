Subject: mcode 197

Hi all,

 

Well after having the firebus for a few months, I finally went through
the mcodes. and it has mcode 197 which Everett describes as possibly a
swiss option.  does anyone have any further thoughts on this?

 

Also, the bus does have the code for the heat vents in the cargo area
(#141) of which it is missing.  Any one out there have one of these for
sale or trade?

 

 

Thanks

 

David
