&gt;Often when new wheel cylinders or other procedures require the brakes to
&gt;be bleed the master cylinder is pumped hard and with full strokes.


also, an old brakes-only guy (since the 50s) told me once that 
sometimes you can pump the pedal so much that the fluid is FULL of 
entrained air bubbles, which will keep giving a soft pedal. when a 
system just won't seem to stop being mushy, he suggests letting it 
sit overnight and trying again.

if nothing else, he said it lets the bubbles in your BRAIN settle 
down, and maybe you'll think of something else going on :)
