Ther are 3 exhust systems out there thet DO fit buses
1.  Tri Mil 
2.  Thunderbird
3.  S S
4. I know I said 3 but Jeff _at_ Kymco makes a beautiful exhust and has been
thinking about doing a bus one.

You have to be SURE that you are getting a BUS header, these are made a
little different and will clear your rear valance without mods, but are a
little tight around the breast plate.
 
On the way to Kelly Park VWHoward lost his exhust (duel muff style) and we
had to stop in Bakersfield to find a new one, all we could find was a bug
header (Empi, Taiwan) and after installation VWHoward had to beat the crap
out of his rear valance for it to fit, thank GoD I had the 8 lb. sledge with
me for him to use.

I have personally used and sell the Thunderbird and the Tri Mil, I have sold
the S S but way pricey for most people, but very good quality, a little
better then the Tri Mil and the Thunderbird.

Comeing in the near future a Bus muffler with larger pipes and better flow
to use on these Hot Rod engines and maintain the apperance of a stock
exhust, will have same style outlet as a stock muffler in the original
location, just bigger to make the exhust flow better, install one of these
mufflers with Bergs new larger  diameter tubeing heater boxes and watch out!

ps, just about finished building the 1776 big valve single port
doing deck height, CC's and setting compression ratio today, then installing
the Autocraft 1.25 ratio rockers and setting up the valve train geometry,
cutting the Chromoly pushrods to fit. Will it ever end.

Does anyone know which of the mail order places sells S&amp;S exhaust 
components?  Does S&amp;S out in Arizona sell directly to consumers?

Exhaust systems are widely advertised in the Hot VWs ads, but they 
never say who makes the parts, and I believe they're usually the 
Taiwanese Bug Pack versions that have a shorter lifespan and are more 
of a pain to install.

thanks,
	Mark
