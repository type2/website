&lt;&lt; What I don't understand is how the problem could have happened, considering
 how much time I spend babying this thing...regular tune ups, added an oil
 filter/pump...synthetic oil...constantly checking the thing out, and
 aargh...it is frustrating. I am wondering if I had stopped at the first sign
 of trouble, would it have been able to save the engine? Or did it probably
 need a tear down anyway....
  &gt;&gt;

well, a rod through the case   horrible.  but if you had stopped you could 
have saved some parts, like case etc.   but it still would have needed to be 
torn down once you hear that noise.  how many miles on the motor?  That can 
happen to an old, tired motor.  maybe running low on oil that one time did enough 
damage to the bearings.  sorry to hear about it.

a bug motor drops right into the bus.  Just make sure the clutch on the bug 
has the clutch that has the round thing in the middle, the generator 
connections are sometimes push on, sometimes screw terminal.    ? fw mesh with your 
starter.   use your air cleaner.  same issues with any motor swap.  check your 
main/oil cooler seals, fuel line, etc before installing.

Yes, when you hear that rattlesnake noise, stop now.  Do not pass go.  Do not 
collect $200.  call tow truck.
