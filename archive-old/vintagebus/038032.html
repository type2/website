 I have four door handles for a bus.
 They appear to be 64-67 push button style.
 Im not sure if these are drivers or passengers (Are they the same?)
 And I am not sure if 67 has a different handle than 64-66.
 Thanks in advance for any help and/or leads.
 Regards, Greg

same handle R or L

yes 67 is differnt that 64-66, but onlt because 67 has an L profile key 
rather than the 64-66 T profile key.  Find an L series key and insert it it 
the lock cylinder, if it goes all the way in, it is a 67 handle, if not it is 
64-66.  Also the bit screwed on at the end of the lock cylinder that when the 
key is turned operates the locking lever in the door mechnism, it has a key 
code stamped into it, which would say what series key, however these can be 
broken off or switched, though I dont think the handle locks well or at all 
depending on combination if the wrong style is used.

They are functionally interchangable however, you just won't be able to key 
all the locks alike with random key profiles scattered willy nilly all around 
your bus.
