Subject: Re: [VB] H4s

Nice thing about the autopal sealed beams,  is if you get some fluted bus
lenses for your buckets, you can break the glass out of the H4 unit, and
have one of them really neat looking 'euro' headlights.  I just did that to
my bus, and they look just like the pair of headlights that were selling for
$250 at Sacto this spring. LOL.

Plus I tossed the 50/55 watt bulbs that come with them for some 55/100 watt
bulbs which I like to call 'the night sun'.  They work really well, just
make sure the lights are adjusted, to avoid the bird from other drivers,
cause you know, that always wrecks my day (or night) when I get that.  (You
gotta admit that having someone say &quot;Geeze, those lights are bright&quot;, when
you're in an old bus is pretty fun.)
