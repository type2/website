Subject: Re: [VB] Shift Coupler - HELP!

Andrew, I could be wrong, but I'm pretty sure that you've just had the gear
stick in the wrong position when you were putting it back together.

Check your manual ( Bentleys or other ), and the procedure for fitting the
coupler will state &quot; put gearstick in&quot; 2nd/3rd or whatever.

If you undo it coupler, put the gearstick in the correct position &amp; then
re-tighten it, it SHOULD engage all gears.

One of the more experienced guys will, I'm sure, come back on this, but I'm
pretty sure that's what the problem is.

&gt; Alright, I had to replace the shifter coupler right at the transmission on
my bus today, and I've run into a little problem.  After replacing the
coupler, I only have reverse, 1st, and 2nd gear.  Anybody have any ideas?
&gt; Is there anywhere to adjust this?  Please help, I'm supposed to go on a
road trip in my bus in about 13 hours!
