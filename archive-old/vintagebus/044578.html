I have ordered rebuild kits for my 58 deluxe from napa auto parts.  I think
Dave Easterwood said he got barndoor rebuild kits from them too.  Mine were
$11.00 a few years back.  I can not remember if it was for one cylinder or for
both in one wheel.  The guys at napa just looked up the part number and had
them the next day.  Come to think of it, another friend got some rebuild kits
for his 51 split window bug from them too, he was the one who told me to check
them out.

think wheel cylinder rebuild kits for the barndoor are the same as for my 69
beetle.  but maybe not.
