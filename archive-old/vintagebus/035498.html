 &gt; Maybe half dozen, no a 
 &gt; dozen splits around, large number of bays.  Seems all the split drivers 
know 
 &gt; each other, but then again this is a small town and if you don't want 
someone 
 &gt; to know what you are doing, don't do it, or don't care if they know.
 
 what small town do you live in that has a DOZEN splitties driving around? 
i'm the    only one in nashville that i've seen that actually drives. i know 
a guy who has about six, but it's mainly just me and him, as far as i know. 
i'm not doubting you, i was just curious.

...Oly WA,   which was evidently recently called the hippest town in the west 
by Time magazine or some such rag.   No clue why they did.   But yes there 
are about half a dozen driving around I regularly see and half a dozen more I 
know drive but I dont see much (differnt schedules/ routes or their use as a 
second car) as wells as more I know of that are yard art, barn art  or &quot;about 
to be fixed&quot;
