I thought I'd ask around and see if any listees have any of the following
items they would like to sell me.  I figure I don't need to buy these items
new - I'm going for functionality and not looks so let me know if you can
help me out.

I need:

used working Bosch blue coil
air vane spring #113119279
Thermostat Bellows #111119159A
Berg oil sump hardware pack (fat chance huh?) :-)
good used pertronix electronic ignition

EMail me at silent_at_beatricene_dot_com - thanks!
