&gt; I just go off the phone with NTB and they said that a Dunlop D60

are
&gt; not 6 ply side walls but talking with him made me think that those
type
&gt; of tires are a rough ride.  The H speed rating is a stiffer tire that
&gt; would stop the &quot;mushy&quot; response in my bus.  Has anybody purchased a
six
&gt; ply tire and been satisfied with it?  Is it correct to think that a
&gt; higher speed rated tire would provide better handling?  And is 195/70
&gt; R14 correct for my 66 bus?

I don't know who NTB is, but I don't particularly like their advice.

A bus is a heavy vehicle for its tire size, and it is rated to carry a
heavy load.  Passenger tires will work for a while, but you will be
happier with light truck tires in the long run.  I separated two belts
on a pair of passenger tires within 100 miles of each other.  The
hassle I had in finding a new tire in Bishop, California on 4th of
July weekend far outweighed the savings realized by running passenger
tires!

The most important marking on the sidewall is the maximum load value. 
this varies with the size and load range.  In the case of a bus, the
magic number is about 1500 pounds.

Figure that a bus weighs about 3000 pounds empty.  It can carry about
2000 pounds of happy passengers and their gear.  5000 pounds divided
by four wheels is 1250 pounds per wheel.  So why does VW specify 1500
pounds?  Mostly because it is very difficult to load a bus so that the
wheels are evenly loaded.

A 185R14 load range D tire is rated at 1700 pounds, so it easily meets
the requirement.  A 195-75R14 load range C tire is only rated at 1435
pounds, so it doesn't quite meet the spec.

Another problem with the 195-75R14 tire is that it is about an inch
smaller in diameter than the 185R14.  This will make the engine run
about 4 percent faster than it would with the 185 tire.  This seems
like a small amount, but the 185R14 tire is already smaller in
diameter than the bias ply tires that came on your bus originally.

As you might know, one of the weak point on buses is the steering
boxes. The wider the tire and the lower the pressure, the more stress
you will put on the box when turning the wheels without the bus
moving.  Remember that those boxes cost several hundred dollars!  The
195 series tire is really a bit too wide for a bus.

I notice very little difference in ride quality between the passenger
tires at 36PSI and the light truck tires at 44PSI.  If anything, the
bus rides better without the swaying and wallowing.  Just  because the
sidewall says that the maximum pressure is 60PSI doesn't mean that you
should run them that high.  Follow the recommendations in your manual.

My suggestion is to take the time to find the proper 185R14 tires with
at least a 1500 pound load rating.  Don't believe what the tire stores
tell you, since they are usually trying to sell you what they have,
not what you need.  If you do happen across a tire store that actually
suggests the correct tire, hang onto them!  Honest people are few and
far between!
