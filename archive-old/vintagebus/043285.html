My 65 standard apparently never had a radio.  I've already put in a cd
player, EQ/amp, and speakers w/only minor, easily hid drilling.  This last
weekend I picked up a nice Optimus am/fm/cassette at a yard sale ($5,
works!) and I'm gonna set it on the shelf.

Radidio Shack (local pronunciation) carries scads of workable antennae for
around $10 apiece, and for a little more I can get a vintage-looking
two-mount version (although I've seen 8-balls and side-mounts on old vws).

I hate to drill it, but if I do put an antenna on the car I'd prefer to do
so in an original style - realizing this was a dealer job &amp; so I probably 
have a bit of latitude. 

So what's your stock-looking antenna setup? What sort of mounting?  Where
is it mounted, if not right front?

Thankee,
joe
