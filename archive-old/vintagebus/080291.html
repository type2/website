Subject: Front snubber replacement procedure

Hi all - I couldn't find any reference to this procedure in the 
archives, or even in the bentley, so I figured I'd post it here, to 
maybe save someone some time.  The snubbers (big rubber things that 
look like giant versions of the rubber stop on the front door)on my 60 
double cab were split apart and rotted, so I ordered new ones from 
wolfsberg west.  They were cheap, like $5 each or something like that.

Procedure:

Block wheels and jack up passenger side
Remove wheel
Put a  scissor jack under front drum, and raise until the old snubber 
has plenty of clearance past the torsion arm, then, pull, or slide it 
off.
I put a little liquid hand soap on the inside of the new snubber
Sort of push and twist it on a little to get it started

Here's where I spent about a half an hour trying to figure out how to 
press it on the rest of the way.  It's an awkward space to work in.   I 
finally found the perfect spot in the &quot;V&quot; of the lower torsion arm.  My 
huge screwdriver went down into the v, and then I leaned in to press 
the snubber right into place.

After this discovery, the driver's side took literally 10 mins from 
start to finish.

Hope this helps someone else in the future

I've decided to get all the mechanicals on the dc in working order so I 
can use it to clear out seven years worth of accumulated crap from all 
the hiding places in my yard.
