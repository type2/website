There is car heater with / without timer up here in the north, kind of a
mini hair dryer, u plug it in the 110V and in winter u start it 1 hour
before u go into the car so all il warmed up and the windhield is all
defrost!!

To warm up the engine there is electric element u could buy to worm the oil
pan, also there is battery heater also... but if temperature dont go below
(above..i mean colder) than -25 Celsius its a waste to heat the battery!!
Better warm the oil pan !!  alos there are model with timers :))

&gt;Seems to me a 110v bathroom heater with an extension cord could warm 
&gt;up the interior of a bus and defrost the windshield while you're 
&gt;caffeinating in the morning. Get fancier with a timer of correct 
&gt;amperage. I suspect electrical costs are cheaper than the gas the 
&gt;engine would burn to heat the interior. Don't neglect to warm up the 
&gt;engine.
