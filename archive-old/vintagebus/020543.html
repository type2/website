Jason, Adrian, George and Scott had questions,and
responses, regarding veggie oil/diesel fuel.  The
links Scott posted are about making veggie oil into a
diesel fuel substitue (popularly known as
&quot;bio-diesel&quot;) that will work in most (all?) diesel
engines with no changes to the vehicle. 

In order to run straight unadulterated used vegetable
oil, the engine fuel system will need some
modifications, including a method of heating the oil
to keep it liquid enough to flow through the
injectors.  There was someone with an old rusty Rabbit
diesel at the Midwest Renewable Energy Fair in June
that had done just this, but I never got to talk to
him to get the details.  Well, I tried to get you VW
enthusiasts to go to the Energy Fair, and it's your
loss if you didn't make it--and living too far away is
no excuse.  I talked to people from Arkansas,
Connecticut, California, Australia, and lots of other
places more than a little ways from Central Wisconsin,
who were there just for the Energy Fair.
