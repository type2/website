Hello again VW Friends!!!
During our monthly Peach State Transporter meeting on Wednesday night, our 
illustrious member ALLEN BECKER announced that he is selling some of his 
vehicles.  As many of you know, Allen has been a VW fan for many, many years 
and has been dedicated to rescuing these vehicles.  Here is a chance for a 
few of you who might be in the market for a vehicle to buy one of his and 
keep it in the family so we can continue to see them at campouts, shows, etc. 
They are as follows:
    Two  1963 23-window microbuses     $2500 for both
    1964 Standard Microbus.  Restored     $7000
1984 Vanagon Camper $4000
1987 Vanagon Camper $6000

If you are interested, call Allen at 770-943-3491 or email him at

Please pass the word to others you might know or any of your VW email lists.
