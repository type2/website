Subject: Drop Spindle Installation?

Anyone had trouble installing Drop Spindles?  Here's the head I'm
having; With replacement Link Pins (which head is twice the thickness)
the head of the Top Pin catches on the Spindle.  I can take out 3 shims
and it will fit.  With my offset Bentley calls for 6 on the outside (Pin
Head side) and 2 inside.  Even with that you'd never get a dust cap in
there.  Now the old, stock Pin, will work with the Setup, but still no
dust cap?  Has anyone else experienced this problem?
 
How important is it t keep the Right amount of shims on the outside
(Pin's head side)?
 
Dave
