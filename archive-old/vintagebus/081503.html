 OK volks, I am contemplating getting off of my lazy rear end, and getting to
 work on body prep for my 63' walkthrough panel.

You will have weeks of work to do on a bus that long!  :)

Kevin, whenever you abbreviate a year, you are substituting the 19 with a '.
If you put the ' after a number, it means feet.
For example. do not becomes don't because the ' takes the place of the o in not.

Sorry if you feel I am picking on you but this mistake seems to be appearing more 
often lately. Poor basic english....... the Samba and ebarf ads are rampant with this.
