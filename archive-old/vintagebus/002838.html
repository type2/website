After this last trip, I feel compelled to do something about Rosie's
braking. She has lots of go, not nearly enough stop. Can anybody fill me in
on the latest changes in the disc brake conversion market. I really want to
keep the stock, wide 5, wheels. I heard that perhaps Wolfgang Int. had a
conversion that would permit this. Anyone out there with knowledge or
experience?

Thanks
