Needed two tires for my '63 crew, the front were not LT and tread was
poor... would not deal with the rain on the road here in Seattle!  So I was
on the look...

Archive searches reveal that 15&quot; tires have NOT had nearly the discussion of
14&quot; tires.  My results say that 6.40&quot; x 15&quot; is what is supposed to be stock.
According to several on the list, this comes out to be close to 195 / 75 /
15 tires.

195 / 75 / 15 seems nearly impossible to find.  215 / 75 / 15 are commonly
the smallest tire available in LT, and they were what was on my truck (so at
least I knew they fit).

  == Visit to Wall Mart ==

Wall Mart has the Uniroyal Loredo in 215 / 75 / 15 at $65.00 each.  I was
ready to purchase them... but they were too busy and I said I would come
back Sunday...

  == Les Schwab ==

Well, then I stopped at Les Schwab.  I was frankly very disappointed.  I
didn't realize that Les Schwab carries ONLY house brand LT tires, and the
two they had in 215 / 75 / 15 LT had tread that seemed more suited for a
tractor than the highway.  And the price was like $75 / $85 for the two
types of tread they had.  Humm ... no thanks.

  == Discount Tire ==

Then I stopped at Discount Tire.  I had forgotten that Discount Tire was a
Yokohama dealer.  ...   Well, the confusion begins right away.

Yokohama sells a tire called the _ Geolandar H/T _ that seems well suited
for poor weather highway (all season).

And Yokohama produces, but Discount Tire didn't stock, the tire in a 205 /
75 / 15 size.  Problem is that they 205 size isn't &quot;C&quot; load rated in the
book, which I had requested.  Not sure about the plys either.  As we didn't
have a tire in front of us...  Anyone have one of these tires and care to
fill me in on the load capacity and number of sidewall plys?  It is
classified as a &quot;light truck/SUV&quot; tire, but isn't &quot;LT&quot; in the model number?

Discount Tire did stock the _ Geolandar A/T _ -- all terrain.  Tread is
actually about 1/2 way between &quot;tractor tire&quot; and &quot;highway tire&quot;...  but the
215 is &quot;C&quot; loaded.  1765 lbs at 50 PSI.  Sidewall is 2 polyester treads,
main is 2 polyester + 2 steel.  In other words, 6 ply.  Oh yes, and &quot;Mud +
snow&quot; rated ( M + S ).  With that tread, I sure hope it can deal with mud
and snow ;)

 === The decision ===

I needed new front tires -- so I was inclined to go with on-hand 215 than
wait to special order 205's from Tire Rack or Discount Tire.  And the
Yokohama brochure was not going to tell us load capacity or number of plys
on the All season models...

So -- I went ahead and got two of the Yokohama All Terrain tires.  The
pressure range (50 PSI) was right and the Discount Tire price was $75 for
them -- only slightly more than Tire Rack wants for them.

For now, I decided to put them up front to replace the worn fronts.  I could
have obviously had my decent rears moved to front and put these on back.
However, I want to see how loud they were, plus get a feel for how they grip
-- and the front seemed the best place to get to know them.  Also gives me
an idea of how well they work in rain.  Lane changes on the interstate in
rain is an area that I hope improves...

I'm driving to Olympia to visit Todd Hill and Clara next weekend, plenty of
chance to see how they deal on the highway in the rain :)  That new tranny
is going in next weekend, Yey!!

So, anyone out there with the _ Geolandar H/S _ who can let us know if they
are a) M+S rated, b) max PSI  c) Load capacity,  d) number of sidewall plys.

The obvious next step, after getting some chance to see how these new All
Terrain fronts do, is go ahead and get two of the _ Geolandar H/S 205's _
and put them in the front... moving the All Terrain 215 tires to the rear
for snow and ice.
