I personally have seen and ridden in this bus.  Jeremy drives this bus
anywhere and everywhere and I can honestly say it's a nice riding, nice
looking, workhorse of a bus.  It moves right along and IMHO is worth the
money he's asking.  The stereo sounds great and everything, to my knowledge,
works and works well...
