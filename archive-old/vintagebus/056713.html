Subject: Re: [VB] cruise/caravan to BYOB/kelley park???

Well heck,
If there are also others on this side of the Bay, why don't we meet somewhere 
here and cruise down that way.
I'm from Concord and I know there are others locally that are going down 
early Sat. am.

We'll have to set up a meeting time and place soon.
