 Hello listmembers,
 
 I have been lurking in the shadows of the VB list dreaming of one day owning 
 a bus myself.  This past weekend I found a &quot;rolling shell&quot; former SO-35 1964 
 bus with a straight body and minimal rust.  The rust is in the usual spots, 
 and the PO had panels cut from a donor bus to replace all the rusty spots.  
 When I get those panels in someday, the bus will be pretty buch rust free.  
 My plan of attack is the following:
 
 1.  rip out super nasty red velvet covered interior panels and carpet. (no 
 joke)
 2.  Remove window glass (the seals are pretty much toast, and I will need to 
 replace them eventually, I figure)
-  - -- 
dont remove glass unless you are ready to immediately reseal it.  
.........
 3.  Wash the entire bus inside and out, underbody too.  Then I can get a 
 better idea of what to do next, and be a little bit less messy 
 (theoretically) doing it.
 - -- - - 
clean is good :-
.........
 
 My question(s) is this:  should I remove the speedo, or the fuel gauge 
 before washing out the interior? 
=========

huh?    Dont know what you are planning, pulling it through a car wash.   
DOn;'t spray water on them.  Beware oif pulling it all apart and making it a 
basket case and losing pieces.   Keep it simple, too much at once gets 
abandoned

..........
 Are there any other things that cannot get 
 wet?  There is no engine in the bus, but the tranny looks good.  I am 
 planning on putting a garbage bag over the tranny bell, and fastening with a 
 bungee cord before I start washing so that I don't get water in the tranny.  
=====
there is a seal there that keeps the oil in/other sptuff out.  Actiually, 
having that clean is nice.
........

 Are there any other potential points of entry, or things I need to look at 
 for?  Let me know if there is something else I should do first, I am 
 planning on re-doing just about everything (wiring, brake lines &amp; mc, etc.) 
 eventually.  Where to begin...
 -  --  - - -
do not redo wiring unless it is bad.  Original wiring is best.    I recommend 
taking it easy,    Take out the ratty velour interior, dump trash in garbage, 
sweep it all out, simple green and a scrub brush  is good.   I like to polish 
and wax the dash as I look at it a lot when I drive.   ,   Get a motor 
somewhere, a battery redo brakes, new axle boots and change tranny oil, lube 
front suspension and drive it.

Then do window seals, and cosmetic stuff
 TIA, &gt;&gt;
