Subject: more m-codes ???????
Message-ID: &lt;8f946ffb.246d084b_at_aol_dot_com&gt;

My 62 samba has m-codes 378, 027, and 530.....I know what 530 is thanks to
Everetts page and Tom's decoder but 027 is the one that has me boggled..I
posted a  message months ago about 378 and got large pop out window latches
as a reply..could anybody help me out with 027.......Also wondering if any of
you had the front(short)part of the shift linkage and a shifter they would be
willing to sell. I also need the shift rod guide. Can anyone help?
