There's a guy in Roseville who repros them - and they're quite nice.  He used
a spare that I had as a pattern (although I still haven't been able toget it back!)

Don't have his number handy, but I'm sure some others on the list do.

&gt; I need either an original non-walkthrough partition panel (with the window)
&gt; or a pattern for one.  Anyone have any ideas where I can get either?
