&gt;   I was wondering if anyone could inform me which way to install my
&gt;vent wing rubber strip.  It is the straight strip that goes in the back
&gt;that the actual glass comes into contact with when it is shut.  It is
&gt;about a foot long.  Do the 2 or 3 little lips go to the outside(contact
&gt;with the glass itself) or does the rounded off side go to the outside

Yes, the lips go against the glass, not the rounded part.
. . .   .. . .. 
I second that
 = = = = = =  =.......

&gt;and connect with the glass?  Thanks!  Oh yeah.  Are rear hatches

I don't know about wide-hatch buses, but the narrow-hatch *is* adjustable;
there's
a series of screws at the top; loosen them up and it will slide around.
I'll bet
the late hatches can be adjusted in a similar fashion.
 . . . ...
THe wide hatches have a completely different set up, as they have those 
springs.  BUt they are actually easier to adjust- loosen tthe 2 13mm bolt at 
each side holding the hatch to the hinge, futz with it a while till right, 
tighten them down, having a helper really helps.
= = = = =  ==
&gt;adjustable?  How about engine lids?  They don't look like it.   Thanks,

Same deal: loose the screws on the body side, and the plate will slide
around a little.

 He's so non chalant about it, just loosen the screws.     :)     Those dry 
rust free buses.  my problem with this (and the 63 and earlier hatches) is 
rust, loosening those screws.   Impact screwdriver.   Dont strip the heads or 
you get to drill it out and try not to trash the threads in the body.     The 
rear hatch for my 61 deluxe has rust and I would love to have my nice solid 
one on there, but those screws are really scary .   I imagine using the 
impact driver and the impact cracking the sigla glass in the bus or the rear 
hatch.    I did replace its engine lid, with much hassle and had to drill out 
a screw on the body.  

  That said, use a tap to clean out the threads, and grease/antiseize on the 
threads and maybe you just want to buy some new stainles steel screws.
