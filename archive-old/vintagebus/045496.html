 It was my first trip &quot;anywhere&quot; in my 62, and my first real highway miles
 on my new 1600DP BAP motor.  According to the gauge it got pretty warm
 back there, and I'd appreciate opinions.
 
 I have a VDO gauge, the sender is tapped into the case on the bottom.
 My gauge reads 120-180-210-250-300, usually hangs around in the 210
 range in town.  It got to 250 at the top of the hill, I stopped at the
 rest area (sunset pt.) and touched the dipstick, no bandages required,
 but I would have wanted a rag or an oven mitt to check the oil (which
 it's not consuming yet).
 
 Then again, I don't know my head temps, nor do I know what kind of
 temperatures lead to actual damage...  It was 89 degrees today on I-17.
 I'm kind-of dreading what will happen to my bus when I try that run in
 the middle of a 104 degree day...
 
 
 So, questions that are answered 1000 times in the archive, but I'm
 wondering still;
 
 Is &quot;250&quot; by the VDO oil temp gauge &quot;overheated?&quot;  
 
 What are the short- and long-term consequences of overheating?
 
 
 Other than looking at the gauge and saying &quot;sh.. the gauge reads 250&quot;
 what are the symptoms that would tell &quot;vw is overheating?&quot;  (My old 
 bus had a certain smell to it, and when you stopped, a certain ticking
 sound that was peculiar to being very hot and tired.)
 
  &gt;&gt;
  ya, 250 is overheated.  The way I see it, since oil degrades at 225 (i 
think thats the number, may be 235 ) F, you want your oil temp to stay below 
that number.  SO what if it doesn't.  What I have noticed is that the oil 
consistancy tends to be odd- partly thin, and partly gloppy.   Has anyone 
else ever see this?  I admit I get anal about changing my oil, I always keep 
a clean oil drain pan, so I can look in the old oil and see what actually 
came out of the motor.     So if your oil 'breaks down' it does not do so 
good a good of lubrication.  That's how I understand it at least.  and when 
it gets hot, you can have things happen like the valves stop working 
properly, heads cracking, etc

have also seen a motor develop issues on a hot dry day on the freeway, which 
turned out to be from a stuck dist, it did not advance.    What it felt like 
was a sudden loss of power.  I didn't know dists could stick until then.  
Luckily it was not my bus we were in.   But you can manually set your non 
advancing dist to 30* total advance and drive 300 miles home on a hot day on 
the freeway.  That's why I now use my strobe light to check the advance every 
tune up.

I dunnno how big that 'hill' was, but 250 is warmer than I would like.  what 
kind of oil cooler do you have?  any rags stuck in the fan?   fresh air hoses 
connections all good?  do check it out.
