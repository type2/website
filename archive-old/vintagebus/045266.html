 absolutely necessary) &gt;&gt;
Hi,
We do not like them because of the sudden shock they produce.  This results
in not only stress against the bearings, but gears in the tranny which could
cause stress cracking.  Due to this and the tendency of people to use as much
force as they can (Hey, Mabel hand me the 20 Lbs. sledge!).  We suggest using
a 3/4&quot; Proto L-bar and matching drive socket.  This set up works even with a
eight foot cheater pipe with no bending or breaking of tools or tranny parts.
 That way only the pressure applied is only what is needed to do the job and
is more of a build up of pressure and not a sudden peak of shocking pressure.
