  I could use some help trying to figure this out. I'm after a bus for sale
that belongs to a friend's uncle, and it's supposedly a '64 or '65....
. He sent me a
number which he says is the chassis' number, but it is not the same kind
as the ones on the chart. The number he sent me is 1173454.-

the nine digit vin number started for the 65 model year.  bus Vin# 1 173 454
would be made in Sept 63, making it early in the 64 model year.  If so, it
would have a wider back hatch than the engine lid, and the engine lid stay
would be an elbow, not a spriing.  The front doors would be the pull handle
type.   There is a little metal tag on the metal partition behind the
passenger seat- the M Code Tag.  The top line of it has the date of
manufacture, the number on the bottom right is the VIN.
