Subject: RE: Air Cooled VW Junkyard

Its been closed quite a while.

i bought the bus they refer to as &quot;Moonbeam.&quot; a 1966 Sea Blau/White pop-top 
SO-44 Westy that had caught fire.... but the guy i bought it from didnt tell 
me it burned up. i found out doing some repairs. im still pissed at him for 
it. the bus is now gone, but the interior lives in my current split.

interesting site none the less, i remember reading it.

&gt;Are any of the folks responsible for this site active on the list?  Does 
&gt;anyone know anything about them?  If so, I'd like to pass on a heart felt 
&gt;thank you.
&gt;
&gt;peace,
