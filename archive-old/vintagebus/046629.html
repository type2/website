&lt;&lt; I need the exhuast bracket that attaches to the bumper/bumper mount on a
 1966 Deluxe split, Or should I wait until I get one to install?&gt;&gt;

Hi Al,
That bracket was eliminated with the introduction of the 1500cc engine which 
was standard here in the US in early 64 model year.
 

&lt;&lt;Metal line through tin area seems to be missing the grommet too, so going 
to fab something up to get rid of that scary thought.&gt;&gt;

You can use a 2&quot; or so length of fuel line.  Slit it down the side and hose 
clamp around the metal fuel line through the forward tin hole.  Best to make 
sure the slit in the flexable fuel line ends upward!

&lt;&lt;Next will be manifold boots (please tell me I can do them with everything 
in place, looks possible..  &gt;&gt;

You can, but it is a major pain.  You might as well drop the engine and 
really do things right with it out of the engine compartment.  Unless you 
have already removed the engine to work it over there probably is poages of 
stuff needed to be done to it.
