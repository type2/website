&gt; .. where has the bus been ... where did it's first owner live ?  How long
&gt; people owned it before passing it on ??

Well there is one bit of information that you can get from the bus
itself. What port the bus was shipped to. It's on the m-plate. Mine
was shipped to NYC. But other than the fact that it was once painted
yellow then white/blue I don't know anything about its history. wish I
did though.
