&lt;&lt; I run 165-15, which is very close to the stock size. When I bought them (at
 Costco) the guy called them Volkswagen tires. &gt;&gt;
Hi Craig,
That is because that size is closest to the T1 bias tire which was 25&quot; 
diameter.  The 1955-63 used a bias tire about 27&quot; dia, or 215/75R15, but 
205/75R15 radials are the widest we have been able to fit on the front end, 
and the pre-1963 buses with thier narrower, and lower rear wheel wells will 
only allow the 205s.  The 1964-67 used a bias tire about 26.5&quot; diameter.
