&gt; another bs trip. But he got on the phone, and ten minutes later announced
&gt; that he had four on the way, and they were the RD603's.

Dang, hang onto that guy and don't quibble if he wants a few more bucks
than the guy down the street.  Honest men are hard to find.

&gt; This tire has been mentioned in several posts with positive comments, and
&gt; this guy hadn't seem my note sheet, so I'm thinking he really *does* know.
&gt;
&gt; Anyway, long babble, if anyone has experience with this tire to share,
&gt; lemmee know quick, as I'll be buying them in a day or two.

I'm very happy with mine.  The only place they are not good is in snow
where they are the next best thing to teflon.  On dry or wet pavement they
are quiet and wear well.
