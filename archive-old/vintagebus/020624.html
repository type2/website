Subject: Good deal on bus???

I don't have a bus yet, but I'm looking at one, and was hoping that someone on this list would be able to help me.  The bus is a 1974, with a new engine and clutch.  The owners put in $4,200 for the bus and are asking $3,000 or best offer for it.  Is this a good deal or not?? Any help or comments would be gratefully appreciated. 
Thanks.
