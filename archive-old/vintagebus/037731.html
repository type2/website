antique titles would work in oregon but only for vehicles that are used for &quot;exhibitions, parades, and club activities&quot; (that's exhibitions not exhibitionist, all you tall guys wearing the goofy hats at the swap meets) the plates are only 3 bucks. I tried to use them for my 67 westy even brought in a picture of it in the Yoncala 4th of July Parade last year, decorated in flags and everything, they didn't go for it, so I went the other way and got those cool most expensive cutom salmon plates, 10x the price ok only 30bucks but hey this is oregon we love our cheap registration

oh, back to the point, in Oregon it's pretty easy assuming you have a bill of sale, just fill out an &quot;Application for Replacement Title&quot; give them the bill of sale and they'll process it through for you, a week or so and you can pick up your plates, they'll also tell you who is the present owner, just in case its changed hands a couple of times, only once did they make me go and get an additional signature and that was on a manx dune buggy. When I buy something without a title the price is adjusted accordingly depending on the pain involved, and i'll usually pass, even for free, if the vehicles present &quot;keeper&quot; is not the registered owner or at the very least possesses a bill of sale from the po, even if I'm cutting it up for parts. It is way easier to register a vehicle than to dispose of one in Oregon with no Title. The key for me, like Thom says is be polite, if the deal is really sweet (flip seat westy or something)and it's worth chasing down signatures remember that its n!
!
ot the previous po's fault that the current owner didn't register the vehicle. Side note, when I sell a vehicle I do the transaction at the DMV, that way you know that it has been done.
