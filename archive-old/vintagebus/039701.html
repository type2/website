At the risk of getting the copyright police up in arms... if anyone has one 
of these they will loan I will happily scan (and return) and provide to 
Thom, if he agrees, for inclusion in the Docs section of VintageBus.  
Takers?  Thom?

&gt;May I suggest for all to read, if you can find a copy, is a book called 
&gt;&quot;SOLEX-SELECTION AND TUNING OF THE CARBURETOR &quot;  by the
&gt;ARNOLT CORPORATION (sorry to all the librarians, no other info
&gt;as far as cataloging). It's long out of print, but is invaluable
&gt;for nit-picky carb info.
