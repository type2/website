Subject: Re: [VB] front beam ID

Hi Mark,
There is supposed to be a front beam ID #, but we have never been able to  
find it.  Otherwise you could ID if it has the spindles still on it and  what 
diameter is the link pins.
  We would suggest getting 1964-67 (1966-67 front beam is best  due to 
antisway bar, and needle bearings the trailing arms ride in!!) RGBs, and  front beam 
for 20% bigger brakes (which seem more 50% bigger when you go down  looong 
hills.) for much better stopping.
