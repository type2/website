&gt;Right, but do not forget to change your oil if more than 6 months has
passed
&gt;by even if you ran the oil in the running engine for only 5 minutes.  After
6
&gt;month the oil changes into acid more and more.  Have two cases that the oil
&gt;ate it's way through the bottom of the case.   Eric &amp; Barb
