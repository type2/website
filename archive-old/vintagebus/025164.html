Hey fellow busnuts!
    I am hoping someone on the list can help me!!
I have been searching for a westy hanging light that plugged in above
the closet and
hung over the eating table.It has a cigarette lighter plug in on one end
and a plastic
tapered shade on the other!! It is the only item I need to complete my
64 westy!!
I will pay a finders fee!! I am willing to part with a chunk of change!!

Please pmail any help !!!!!!!
Thanks, woody
        &quot;keep on pushin'&quot;
