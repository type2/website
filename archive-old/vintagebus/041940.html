&gt; As for vintageveedub's complaint about Lloyds of

&gt; listing of &quot;Ask all questions before bidding, and ALL
&gt; SALES FINAL&quot;.

Well, it sounds like you certainly had yourself covered on that one.  With
that disclaimer you could have shipped a box of bricks and been _legally_ 
in the right!

&gt; And I might add that the buyer even
&gt; attempted to set up an email account and pose as me,
&gt; in an effort to scam them out of a refund. So I guess
&gt; if I am a &quot;piss ant crook&quot;, that makes you a &quot;piss ant
&gt; schmuck&quot;....an illiterate one at that. 

That doesn't sound very nice either.  Two wrongs don't make a right.
Name-calling seldom solves any problems either.

This thread has given me excellent reasons to stay away from
e-bay.  Misrepresentation of merchandise, use of shady legal loopholes,
and general ill-will between the ebay users leads me to the conclusion
that the crooks have generally taken over the service.

OTOH, I've had nothing but good luck with the bus lists.  Seems that if
you get to know people on the lists your transactions go smoother.  Even
the problems that people have had with each other seem to often work
themselves out.
