Subject: RE: Jetting for Dual Weber IDF's (long)

&gt;First of all, here is what the Weber tech book says you must run for 
&gt;an engine with a 1776cc displacement and dual carb arrangement:

&gt;40IDF Jetting Guide Dual Carb
&gt;1600cc to 1835cc
&gt;Venturi = 28mm (mine is labeled 28)
&gt;Main Gas = 140 (mine says 115)
&gt;Main Air Correction = 210 (mine says 170)
&gt;Emulsion Tube = f11 (mine says f11)
&gt;Idle = 55 (mine says 50)

You're correct in your assessment that your carbs are set up for a 1600.
Actually, that set up is too much carb for a 1600, but it's about as close
as you can get.  But I think the recommendations listed by your book may be
suspect too.  Set ups vary according to cam, valve sizes, altitude, and even
personal expectations.  There are usually multiple setups that will work for
any engine combination and each of them have there good points and bad
points.  The goal is to get a set up that you like that has a good balance
of power vs economy, doesn't run overly lean at cruising speeds, and doesn't
run overly rich at idle.

I'm currently running 28 venturis, 125 gas, 185 air, 50 idle, and f7
emulsion on my 1776 with stock cam and big valve heads and 009 distributor.
What I get is great acceleration at all speeds (I can pull from below 2000
RPM to 5000 RPM in 4th gear with no sweat).  I have no stumbling off of
idle, no noticeable flat spots, and crappy gas mileage (16 mpg).  

The f7 emulsion tubes are almost a necessity for type IV motors in order to
correct stumbling when coming off of idle (the f11 tubes provide a much
leaner transition from idle to main jets).  I plan to play around with my
setup as time permits.  First thing I'll try is swapping in the f11 tubes
and if that doesn't cause problems, then I'll probably try some smaller
mains in an effort to increase my mpg (I know I'm running rich right now
because of the smell and the mileage).

I believe the 28 venturis are correct for a 1776 and maybe even an 1835, but
any more displacement than that and you'd want to go to 30mm or, for 2 liter
and above, probably 32mm.  For a 2.0 type IV motor, the 32's are just right,
but on a 1700 or 1800, the 30's work better.  Smaller venturis tend to give
you better low-end power, but too small will severly limit your top end.  I
tried 28's on my 1800 type IV one time and had trouble getting the motor
above 4000 RPM in 4th whereas with the 30's, I had good power up to 5000.  I
also ran 36's (in 44 IDF's) on the same motor for a while and, while I had
really good top-end power, I had a lot of stumbling and poor power in the
under-3000 RPM range.

BTW, jets (air, main, idle) usually cost around $4 each and venturis and
emulsion tubes are in the vicinity of $15 each (and of course you need 4 of
each).  A good quality crossbar linkage is worth its weight in gold.  Don't
use that jinky little piece of crap that BugPack makes with the flimsy
mounts and the round bar.  It will cause you nothing but trouble and
constant adjusting.  I prefer the Weber X-bar linkage (around $100), but I
understand there are some other hex-bar (ie. solid 6-sided bar instead of
round) linkages that are just as good and cost about the same.  Also, invest
in a good carb tool.  I like the syncrometer ($50) and consider it one of
the best tools I've ever bought. 

Conclusions?  None.  Just sharing my experience and running on at the mouth.
Hope some of it helps and if you have any questions or ideas, please share
them with me.
