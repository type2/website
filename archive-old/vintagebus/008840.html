&gt; I am glad to see most of the folks that told me I was
&gt; 'nutz' to stay stock and listen to vw themselves are
&gt; now recanting of sorts! :-)
&gt;
&gt; I always said the freeway flyer stuff is ok if you got
&gt; the big horses to do it...otherwise go stock.
&gt;
Now don't forget that NQ IS ALSO RUNNING TALL TIRES!!!!  It is a combination
of the tires with the freeway flier with his 1776 that is causing the
problem.  I bet that when he gets new 14&quot; rims and tires He will be as happy
as a pig in a ......bus!
