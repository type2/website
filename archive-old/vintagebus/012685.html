A couple of years ago I had a friend that was driving the 67 squareback his parents bought new in 67.  Of course at this time it was missing the hood and the rear door but was registered and was fully functional.  He parked it on the street in front of his house when he come home from work for lunch one day and when he got back outside after lunch to drive back to work his car was gone.  He called the cops to report it stolen and found that they had towed it as an abandoned vehicle.  They gave it back but he had to pay some sort of towing fee.  I think I would have had a heyday with them for towing a registered and operational vehicle like that.
