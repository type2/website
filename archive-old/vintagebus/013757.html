Yesterday I sucked in my gut, dragged out the almost
cordless drill, and started punching holes in the
S/C... Then put in the 2lb slidehammer &amp; started
pullin dents. Not bad ones, most could be got at by
pullin the interior panels, but a few couldnt be got
at that way:( Anyway all of em tapped out real nice,
ALL of em:)
 Now the Question (always a question, right?) What is
the best way to fill in the small holes that Ive put
in it? Been told everything from bondo (not), to lead,
to Dyna Glass. Anyone know the best way to fill em for
the long run. Its not gonna be done cheesy. Got a wire
fed welder, torches with brazin capibilities, ect...
Whatever it takes.
Thanks,
David
