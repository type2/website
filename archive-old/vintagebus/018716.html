Andrew, when I was doing my muffler, I bent on mine some by putting a small
crowbar in the tubes and yoinking on it - that sheetmetal of the muffler is
TOUGH to bend!  Only after doing that did I find that I had to do something
more drastic.  So I bit the bullet and did the watermelon slice thing -
something you definiely don't need to do.  By the way, after bending the tubes
(of course the sheetmetal of the muffler will bend before the tubes will..) be
sure to &quot;re-aim&quot; that small tube that is inside the muffler.  This small tube
can be seen by looking through where the tailpipe will slide into.  (I'm
assuming you have a real bus muffler - the bug ones have two of these ports
and only one of them have the small tube in there.)  By re-aiming, I mean that
this tube should poke straight at you when looking STRAIGHT into the port. 
This small tube should be centered in relation to that tailpipe port.  It is
important, because it uses the Bernouli effect to create a small low pressure
area at the tip of this small tube so that air will be drawn out of it - this
is how the air is drawn through the heatriser tube.  That, and the other end
of this system is at a high pressure area - that is, right at the exhaust
port.  By centering the tube, the system will work more efficiently, assuming
your heatriser is not plugged of course.

All I need is 3/16 of an inch and I'm home free.

***ORIGINAL MESSAGE***

&gt;It appears that the previous owner installed some spacers between the
&gt;case and cylinders. This is complicating my plans to use a stock
&gt;muffler and stock 34 pict carb on 1600 dual port. It appears that
&gt;the spacing between the #2 and #4 exhaust ports is 3/16&quot; too wide.
&gt;
&gt;I'd appreciate any suggestions as to how to stretch the muffler and
&gt;heat riser tube to fit. I'd rather not go dual carbs and extractor
&gt;exhaust.
