Believe me, that bus was in sorry shape.  It has been hit hard in the front
at one time, and had been very poorly repaired.  It was sectioned (poorly)
right down the center of the cab, up to the seat pedestal, and out to the
door.  It had random sections of rust and bondo.  I've brought back some
bad buses, but in my opinion, it was better off as a donor.  Part of the
cargo floor is now in Tom's single cab; the doors are on the '60, Matt has
the fuse block, and Steve M is getting the walk-thru section.  Some of the
other parts have gone to listees or ebayers, and the rest is sitting on my
side yard (FrankieHill can attest to that!)
