See, there's something about auctions. People tend to think they get better
deals bidding on something. It seams that it's like that with everything
that is auctioned though. But true, the description could be of anybody's 23
window, who the heck knows what you're really buying? Well, unless the guy
just had ($25.00 eBay fee) money to burn.

Watch this one though,

&gt; &lt;&lt; Is this for real? counting on that Japanese guy? _at_ $10K and still not
&gt;  perfect? well?
&gt;   &gt;&gt;
&gt; I would expect to see a reasonably nice 23 go for 10k on ebay. I saw a POS
&gt; one go for 3+, The guy was trying to sell it for $1200 and couldnt get any
&gt; takers before he auctioned it.
&gt;      the thing that gets me is that the guy has a starting price of 10k
with
&gt; a 2 line decription and no pictures. if it sells I'm going primer all my
&gt; buses gray and put them on ebay as almost NOS.
