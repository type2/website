  It all started out well enough on Wednesday, getting ready for the trip to
Cali. (OCTO), then it happened, my gland nut broke and I lost a flywheel!. I
pulled the engine then 8 doweled a new flywheel and surfaced it, got
everything installed and working fine. Now I'm a day behind as I planned on
leaving Friday evening. Sat. rolled around and I loaded my bus and hit the
road (around 11:00 am). Left Havasu heading for the freeway, then ran out of
gas, luck was on my side as the gas station (truck stop) was in sight and
downhill from where I ran out. Coasted in all the way to the pumps and
proceeded to fill up. 10, 12, 14, 15 then 15.8 gallons, WTF. I have a bay 15
gallon tank and it took almost 16?, I think there pumps are cheating as on
my return trip I filled up there and again it took more gas then when I
filled up at the same distance going the other way. 

   On the trip out I hit some interesting occurrences, First I went through
Snow, that slushy stuff that melts before it hit's the ground. Then I
stopped for gas again and when I went in to pay there was an earthquake.
The I was trying to figure out why my heater wasn't working up to par and
turned the floor vent on and found my problem. A creature had built a nest
and the tube was stuffed full, I proceeded to clean this out and it really
started blowing good, ah nice warm air. So then I thought I'd close the
lower vent and then it happened, I thought I was going through a Mohave dust
storm, the whole inside of my bus filled with dust. After the dust settleled
I proceeded on my JOURNEY, only 150 more miles to go. Then the rain came,
six volt wipers in heavy rain, manually turning them on and off not to burn
the motor out, for the next hundred miles wasn't fun (time to install the
volt-a-drop), then the winds came, so besides working the wipers I had to
fight the headwinds.

  I finally got to my first destination, West Coast Classics, to enjoy the
BBQ they were putting on. There were people everywhere, Bill Bowman (neato),
Neil Picket and others that had flown in for the occasion. Woody was there
to finally pick up his DD panel that Lenny did and just about anyone in the
bus requiem were there for all over the world. I was impressed with the
amount of work I saw done at Lenny's, there were 3 vehicles in stages of
completion that were just stripped down when I was there a couple of month's
ago, a lot of work done in a short time in my opinion.
  After filling my gut with really good BBQ, I was off to my next
destination, a friends house with a bed, shower and warm air, it was
freezing in Cali and wet so I decided to blow off the Pre OCTO camp-out for
the comforts of home.
   OCTO, what can I say, busses, buses and more buses. Nothing that really
stood out or would make great conversation but just a lot of buses and some
killer parts. I got a original SO 23 table for my Westy, so now I don't have
to make it and that was it. I really didn't have time to cruise around once
I set my stuff up so I know I missed a lot of stuff. There were bus after
bus for sale there, about anything you could imagine For Sale, but the
people selling must of thought it was the Classic or Pomona as most of the
prices seemed way out of line for some really nasty stuff. If you are really
into buses and are looking for some parts OCTO is a must as you WILL find
what you need. Safaris! you need them, there was a guy there with 5 sets and
he said he had 2 more he didn't bring, Originals, complete, even with the
windshield top mounting areas!!.

   The drive home was uneventful, bus cruised fine at 75 mph, fuel economy
sucked, 13-15 mpg and I did learn that buses like to get light in the front
end at 80 plus mph. So the question is it worth the sacrifice in fuel
economy for the ability to cruise at speed?. Remember I use this bus for
shows and drive long distances to get to them on limited time, if not I
would use a stock trans and engine.
