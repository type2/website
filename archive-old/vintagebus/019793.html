It's because of him that I will never go to bed at
Jerome ever again, sober or otherwise. Thom has a
picture of this &quot;Rubber Johnny&quot; moron on his website.
I think that the &quot;Shock the Monkey&quot; K loop was between
12 and 2:00. It was the endless yelling of
&quot;Dubewe,Dubewe,Bub-daewe Social Disease Foreveryone
dot com!&quot; that went on between 2:00 and 4:00. Things
quieted up to some degree between 4:00 and 7:00AM with
Kyle, Joe Ginter and I standing in his face during
that time. His buddy took another hit of whatever it
was and climbed the talus slope (rock hill) and tried
to ride the rocket. &quot;Rubber Johnny&quot; decided to totally
harrass and attempt to intimidate my family thereafter
by sarcastically commenting on our every movement. If
Mr. Noble does really know this person's real name
please send it to America's Most Stupid so they can
put out an All Points Bulletin.
Drum Circle my butt. Tom Bodett has the lights left on
for me.

AHHH, I'll never forget that guy.  It's because of him
I'll never go to bed sober at Jerome again....I'm
going to pass out or stay up all night from now on.
