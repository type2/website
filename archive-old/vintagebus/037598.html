Subject: [VB] Double cab gate removal &amp; THATVWGUY's shifter extension
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

Thanks to those of you who suggested the manual impact wrench to remove the 
screws for removing the gates of my doublecab. Of 
12 screws, 10 came out with no problem....which leads me looking for another 
recommendation...
    
    2 screws heads stripped, keeping me from removing one gate....How should 
I best handle this?

Comment:  Ordered Double Bend Shifter extension from DAN aka THAT VW GUY_at_ 
aol_dot_com.....I am most pleased with it, its quality is fantastic....and he 
shipped quick....I recommend it..if you need one...
