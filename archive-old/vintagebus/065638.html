Subject: Changing lowered bus tires...

I had a lowered 61 Double door panel for a while. It had big rear tires
on it as well. I would have to break the brake drum loose and then
unbolt the wheel. I could then take the wheel off of the brake drum and
then take the brake drum off of the axle. I could then squeeze the brake
drum out of the back of this mess and that would give me just enough
clearance to get the tire and wheel off. Needless to say I carried a
couple of cans of &quot;fix-a-flat&quot; for roadside repairs. Cool bus but not
very practical.
hope this helps,
Craig
