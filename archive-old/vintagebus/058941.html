If anybody is interested I have rediscovered a hidden VW junkyard down in
Altus Oklahoma that has a ton of stuff in it. I say rediscovered because I
was stationed there in the Air Force until 1990 when I got stationed in
Japan. I discovered this place by accident , it's located at the end of the
runway (north) just off of Altus A.F.B in a big huddle of tree's. The guy
who ran the place only let me back there one time to retrieve a part for my
59 bug and that was it. Well apparantly he is now very close to departing
this place we call earth, or already has, and his junkyard now belongs to
his son who also not very far behind his father, I learned all this from the
mother who lives in the house right in front of the place. Anyway from what
I could see from my driveby's is that he has panels, deluxes and standard
splittie's back there along with bugs and type 3's and whatever else in the
very large garage next to the house.. The mother that lives there told me
that the estate was being settled by their lawyer who I assume lives in
Altus. It's a very small town out in the middle of nowhere so it probably
wouldnt be hard to track down this person. There is one VW enthusiast there
but I have never met him, He had a 21 deluxe a doublecab and a bug by the
side of his house that you could tell were in work, and very nice and
complete but he wasnt home when I was down there a month ago. I live to far
away right now to investigate further and really dont have the time also so
if there's anyone else willing to &quot;road trip&quot; it there and check it out you
might find a nice stash or new project if your lucky, good luck.

P.S. Altus is in the very southwest corner of Oklahoma near the texas
border........
