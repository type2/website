&gt; OK, why when it didn't sell the first time, why didn't the second highest
&gt; bidder take the auction? I thought that was they it worked. And I looked and
&gt; saw that sonicvw and jonny5111 are bidders on almost every one of his 5
&gt; auctions and almost all the high bidders have low feedback profiles. I smell
&gt; a snake.

I asked the last high bidder why he didn't get it and here's what he's reply
was..................

I sure can. I bought this bus from this guy last week on Ebay.  His ad said
that seller pays shipping and once he found out I live in Iowa he lost my
down payment in the mail {or so he said}.  And with no phone calls or emails
it is back on Ebay, where buyer now pays shipping. watch out!!!

That's all I know.........
