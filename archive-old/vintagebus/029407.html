Subject: 1960's LHD cars wanted (UK)

I've got a contact at Granada who needs some early 60's (or 50's) German
vehicles (cars, trucks, vans)
for filming in Liverpool soon.  The film is a period 60's drama.

If you think you have something suitable email me.  They must be LHD and
it would be nice to see
something other than vw's on set so if you know anyone with early mercs
and other stuff let
me know.  They pay good money - in the region of  £100 / day, and you
can drive it to the set
to keep an eye on it.

Lee.
