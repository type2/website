&gt; I just returned from Jackson, Wyoming.  I saw quite a few buses there:
Splittys, Early Bays, a few late Bays, and Vanagons.  I was wondering
what it's like to drive the 20 or so miles from Jackson, Wyoming to
Victor, Idaho in a Bus.  Seems like it might be a bit of a challenge with
the 8000 ft elevation and the 10 percent grade.
&gt;
&gt; Anybody ever done this drive in a Bus?

I've done it.  As long as you are patient it's not a problem.  That's what
gears are for.
