Subject: RE: [VB] PUsh Rod Tubes

ALL adjustable push rod tubes leak, SCAT's (double o-ringed), Autocrafts (a
little better), and even all the 3 styles from Taiwan. The best I have seen
are the Taiwan nutted style (with a little silicon), but they don't expand
with the engine. There was a guy here in Havasu who was making BILLET push
rod tubes that didn't leak, but that was because he used and extremely high
thread count per inch and had over 3 inchs of thread. These cost over 80
dollars a set and he was loosing money if his time counted for anything.
STOCK works the best.

ronnie  just my experience

Subject: [VB] PUsh Rod Tubes



Has anyone ever used the SCAT push rod tubes that are spring loaded?  The 
concept seems a good one but I have not met anyone who has actually used the

SCAT variety only the earlier ones which were not entirely successful.  
Opinions?  Real life stories?
