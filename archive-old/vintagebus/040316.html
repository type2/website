Greetings,

You can see some description about fitting seat belt mounts
that meet Australian Design Regulations at

www.splitbusaustralia_dot_com

click on the 'Our US 23 window' link in the left
hand frame and then the 'fitting seat belt mounts'
link....

I have added some measurements for the front pillar
mounts on the 'update pages' - the link is in left hand frame..

The upper sash mount needs to be well above the height
of the shoulder to be completely effective and
as safe as possible.

I'e been thinking about this  for years, and may
actually do something about putting rear seat belts in
my 65 double cab in the near future.
Has anyone done this, and if so, what is the best
method to use?  I did some looking in the archives but
found nothing useful.
