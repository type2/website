My aluminum steps, earlier version then the bay has 2 spring bars with pins
on the ends that fit in the holes on the bottom of the jack points.

powder coated end castings even later.

&gt; I recently obtained a (VWOA?) slide in style step for my 65' bus. The step

&gt; is common enough it has two brackets which slide into the jacking points 
&gt; and is joined by a piece of brushed aluminum which foms the &quot;step&quot;.

Hi Michael,
Hmm, that is funny!  We were just going through our old accessory catalogs 
and saw that!  It was distributed by VOA as Part number ZVW 151 601,
Suitable 
for Type 2, Reference 8/67 - 7/77,  Except for vehicles with propane 
equipment.  They used a coil spring to keep the step in the jack stands,
Part 
number ZVW 151 651 to pull the center of the step and the other end of the 
spring was attached to somewhere under the bus.
