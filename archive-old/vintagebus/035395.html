&lt;&lt; hey all,
 i am going to remove the transaxle from the parts bus soon and after 
 checking the archives i came up a little short. can someone kinda walk me 
 through it. easiest way possible. should i remove it drum to drum? in 
 pieces? also, anyone ever cut a pop-top (small) into a hardtop? im gonna 
 just cut around it and weld it in as one piece. oh yea, and up front... are 
 seized and crusty king &amp; links worth saving? or do they cost just as much to 
 buy or rebuild... considering all the places that are hoarding them up in 
 exchange for those sweet lowering beams. yeah!
 thanks in advance,
 Bob Margiotti

get a copy of muir idiot book, tells you how to remove a tranny clearly and 
concisely.
I would remove the drums w/ tranny on car, easier than when it isn't

Rebuild link/kingpin places charge for cores, so yes I would keep those.

is this bus really so bad as to smoosh it?   ;(
