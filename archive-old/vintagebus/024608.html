Maybe welding is the way to go.  Yes, hinges can be had, and the price
isn't that bad.  but why replace what can be fixed?  Can you bend it
back in place?  Realize this will stress everything it mounts to.  You
can remove it.  If you're afraid the plate might drop inside, then take
it apart SLOWLY and watch the parts as you disassemble.  If it looks way
loose it probably is.  So you have to have a plan B.  Sounds like you've
a welder handy.  Have it ready to tack the plate enough to hold it in
place, or stop disassembling, tighten everything up, and wait until
you've thought out an alternative to losing things to the bowels.

One person felt it could be welded, but I don't think that's the best
solution. Replacement, obviously, is the best option. I've heard the
horror stories of backing plates falling down into the bowels of the
bus, never to be seen again..'
