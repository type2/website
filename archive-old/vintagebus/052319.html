Subject: Temp/Pressure Senders


Is it true that one should not use selants or teflon tape on the threads of 
temperature or pressure senders, as doing so will cause the gauges to read 
incorrectly?  (The cause being that the selant or tape will keep the sender 
from grounding properly). If this is true, what can you use to keep the 
little buggers from slowly leaking oil?

Thanks,

Richard
