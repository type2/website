Howdy All!
In my 66 camper, on the &quot;collar&quot; that goes around the speedo and connects to the steering column, There is a small little switch.  It is almost like a little miniature light switch.  What the heck is this for??  It looks stock, not like some wiring butcher job rig (like I would create).  Also I By-passed the 9 prong box and installed a flasher on this bus to try to get brake light &amp; turn signals.  I followed Matt Roberts' directions in the type2_dot_com library and it worked, I now have brake lights and turn signals (Thanks Matt!)  However, when the ignition is OFF, the turn signal indicator light in the speeo stays ON.  When the key is turned on, ot goes out and then operates as intended (it blinks when the signal is on) but then when the ignition is turned off, it comes on and stays on.  WHATS UP WITH THAT??  Any ideas??
