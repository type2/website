&gt;&gt; That kid struck me as kind of a goober and if I were him I would sell the
&gt;&gt; dryer, .........
 
&gt;...... its sill on the road, thats what matters. some of us want
&gt; to drive our buses instead of having them in various states of restoration
&gt; for 15 years never to move more than 20 feet at a time.

AMEN! 

I finally cut a new opening in the rear of my Garage over the weekend so I
could roll the 65 Deluxe Westy? into the garage &amp; out of the back yard.(it
was serving as a cocktail lounge) Moved it about 15 feet. Sweet! It's only
been sitting for about 10-12 years-hope to have it on the road for the
Havasu Campout in Jan.

Pax,

Tom Buese-been collecting parts for this bus for years-why? To put it back
on the road!
