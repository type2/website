Subject: Re: [VB] The name game

I have never been big on names and all my cars do not
have them.  I usually prefer descriptive names to
common names, for instance my 99 New Beetle in the
comsic green looks like a big phlegmglobber so I call 
it the &quot;Lugeywagen&quot; and the Packard is yellow/black so
I call it the &quot;Bumblebee&quot;.  Perhaps if I had a brown
car I would call it the &quot;Dingleberry&quot;.  Lucily none of
my ACVWs have names yet.

&gt; In this &quot;naming&quot; trend for Buses.  I going to call
&gt; the 66, when it's done,
&gt; Doghouse.  My wife does like VW Buses and tells me
&gt; I;m going to be sleeping
&gt; in it if I'm not careful.  So the name Doghouse
&gt; seems right.

&gt; &gt; '59 Deluxe = &quot;Jack&quot; named after the guy I bought
&gt; it from
&gt; &gt; '61 Westy = &quot;SB&quot; (Stupid Bus)  Girlfriend named it
&gt; when I brought it home.
&gt; It was the third bus at the time and she was a
&gt; little bitter.

&gt; anyone
&gt; &gt; &gt; would care to share the story of how their bus
&gt; got the
&gt; &gt; &gt; name it now has.
