&gt;&gt;well, that looks like an 6 April 65  bus to me - with the 9 digit vin
the 
third number is the YOM,  okay.

  Don't understand though the may 5-11 bit, thoughthe called its last
day the 
production date, and that it would be april 65.  

they dropped the year off the date line at some point- either for 64 or
65 
model year.  definately 65s did not have it- the date line reads DAY
then 
MONTH.&lt;&lt;

No question on this end.  6 April 65.  The May date may have been the
day it left the plant and was shipped.  My '67 plate says 22 June, but
the birth certificate says 24 June.  It was picked up by the original
owner at Wolfsburg.

In the NEATO Old Bus Registry, the last DD MM Y date on a production
plate is &quot;28 02 3&quot; (28 Feb 1963) for chassis number 1.069.028.  The
first DD M date is &quot;14 3&quot; (14 Mar 1963) for chassis number 1.077.847. 
My best guess is at the end of February 1963 VW changed the date code.
