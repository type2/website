&gt;What size fuse should these H4 have 25amp?

There is one fuse for both low beams and one fuse for both high beams.
The right rating depends on the current drawn by the bulbs.  Two 55W
or 60W filaments will draw around 10 amps, so I'd try a 15 A fuse.
Two 90 W or 100 W filaments will draw around 17 amps, so yeah, a 25 A
fuse would probably be about right.  A 20 A fuse might work, but might
also tend to blow when the lamps are turned on, or when the system
voltage is high.

Make sure you have spare fuses in the Bus, since you'll be only two
fuses away from no forward lighting.

&gt;Does the Dimmer relay stay in the circuit and that's what activates
&gt;the relays for low and high.

Yes.  Substitue &quot;dimmer relay&quot; for &quot;beam selector switch&quot; in that
diagram ( http://lighting.mbz_dot_org/tech/relays/relays.html ).

&gt;I'm running 3 additional 10 g wires from the battery in the back.

This should be equivalent to about 4.0 mm^2 wire.  Per Bosch, this has
an ampacity of about 40 A at 30 C (86 F) and 30 A at 50 C (122 F).  So,
I wouldn't fuse this wire at greater than 30 A.

&gt;I get off a 2330hrs and drive 26 miles on a Country road with Deer.

Hmm.  In that case, you may also be interested in the information found
at http://www.type2_dot_com/library/%62%72%61%6b%65%73.htm ...
