Subject: Electrical problem

Hello again-

Before I throw in the towel on the many electrical problems in my 67 Westy,
I thought I would see if anybody knows if something else I can check:

Symptoms:

Red and Green speedo lights do not come on when the key is turned &quot;on&quot;, but
glow brightly when the engine is running.

What I've done:

1) Ran through the checkout sequence in the archives, which leads me to
believe that the battery, generator and probably the regulator are working
correctly.  (Battery shows 12.5V with the engine off, and 14.5 with the
engine running at high idle.  There also do not appear to be any grounds in
the charging circuit).

Any ideas?

On another note, there is a wire coming off of the regulator (the same pole
as the battery connection I believe) that has an inline fuse (looks like 8
amps) that appears to be a factory item, but is not shown on the wiring
diagram (either Bentley's or Thoms).  The wire runs behind the engine and
disappears above the wheel well on the left side of the bus going forward.
Is this a Westy unique installation, and does anybody know what it does?

Finally, there is a small brown wire running wild out of the body (not one
of the connections) of what the wiring diagram says is the emergency light
relay.  Does anybody know where this is supposed to go?

If I can get the above sorted out, I can start working on the short in the
turn signal circuitry!

Thanks for any help.
