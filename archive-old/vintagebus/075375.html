Splitnosers,

  Anybody seen those Phillipine taxi carts called &quot;jeepnees(sp?)?&quot;, each
one is made to look different than any other they are all lifetime
projects.  They are really cool!!

  Anybody seen a &quot;Levittown&quot; in NJ or Long Island -- classical cookie
cutter housing tracks, then time when by, eventually the zoning-cloning
people lost control - now everyone's house now looks different, and I'm
glad!  (still, don't get lost cause all the streets and houses still look
the same...BTDT).

  I admire what the original looked like, as I see others admire the
individuality of mine.  There are many things like that, that make us feel
good comparing because DNA exists for replication. {Digressing} Wine
makers use sulfites cause bacteria DNA helix's can't line up without the
protection of the nucleus like the yeast have, the bacteria population is
held static while the yeast builds their empire.

  When you go to VW shows or park next to another, and you listen very
carefully to the metal &quot;tink-ing&quot; you can hear them congradulating each
other on how gracefully they have aged or is it because they are using
botox?, who is hiding WMD?  who has the latest GM?...heh, heh, heh

Best,
joe
