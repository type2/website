Subject: cutting up a bus
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

What would be the safest way to cut up a bus?
I'm guessing start with the roof and work your way down?
So should I cut the roof in sections? Where do I make the cuts? Does anyone 
have a website showing the safest way to do this?

Thanks,
Brian
