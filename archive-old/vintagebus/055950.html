Subject: Re: [VB] Bottom tin opinions - Fluid dynamics anyone?

On a vehicle moving 60 - 70mph down the highway I doubt there is much
difference as to if the fan air exits out the bottom or the bottom rear of
the engine compartment.  The point was to provide additional cooling while
at stop lights etc when there would be minimal outside air/vehicle movement.
The sump is the closet part of the engine to the road.  On a nice 100+
degree day stopped at a long light on a black road at high noon I'm guessing
the temperature 12&quot; off the road would be higher than that of the air coming
off the cylinders.  Even if it isn't, it only needs to be as cool or cooler
than the sump to be effective.

&gt; Why do you want to blow hot air across the sump?
&gt;
&gt; the goal of the original tin is to get the hot air out of the back of the
&gt; bus as quickly as possible.  If you just blow it out the bottom of the
&gt; engine, it has more of a chance to recirculate.
