 What is the type of oil in the Reduction boxes ? &gt;&gt;
Hi,
The same as the tranny and steering box, 90WT.  We use a 85/90WT Sta-Lube that
has GL-4 rating and is availible nationwide in the USA.  Which is important
when you need to repair and/or refill on long trips.  Before you drain and
refill the reduction gear boxes make sure you drain the tranny center section
and refill it only after you refill the reduction gear boxes when done working
on them.  It will take about 1 USA gallon to fill everything.  Do yourself a
big favor and get the Bentley reprint of the pre-1968 bus workshop manual for
your bus.   Eric &amp; Barb
