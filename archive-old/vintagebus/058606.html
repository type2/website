Subject: Re: [VB] Morning Idle: What is this?

Craig,

Pop on a &quot;good&quot; coil that you are sure is new or &quot;good&quot;.  I just went
through almost this same thing.  It would run good at speed but when cold
would idel like crap and almost die.  When driving while still cool it
would stall at the first or second stop light on my way to work.  This went
on for a few weeks.  I tried everything to adjust the bad idle out of the
brand new 30/31 on my 1K all new all balanced 110 camed vac adv. dist.
1600cc motor( ah...internet grammer ;-)

Well after a few weeks of this the damm bus strands me at the bottom of a
busy freeway offramp with a nice 3 block push to get out of traffic.  It
would not fire at all...went from driving great to nothing.  Once I finally
got a look at it, the only thing I'd not changed/checked was the original
short '67 black coil.  I'd kept it cuz it looked original (ala Dave). 
Slapped on a big new blue (yuk) coil and it been running and idleing great
ever since.

Seems there just was'nt much poop left in the poor old coil to give the
plugs a good spark at idle.  

Hey david....need a OG coil.....all original with part #'s and everything
;-)

Steve
