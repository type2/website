&lt;&lt; All this talk on driving buses, how many of you have ever looked to see how
 many 60's American iron you see on the road on a daily basis? &gt;&gt;

funny about that, I was just talking to someone about that the other day.  
they were saying what POS cars VWs are, and I said, well how many VWs do you 
see on the road- you see dozens of 30ish  year old bugs everywhere, nothing 
special.    I've had my bug for almost ten years, and I dont think it;s 
special (Jason said he got a new paint gun- how about practicing on my bug 
cauise I dont care what it looks like :) (thoiugh I do like my bugster) Other 
cars- I see the occasional old Volvo (there's a sporty one with a racing 
stripe often parked downtown) or dodge dart, and since it is summer, seems 
almost every day see an old 40s car or two, and there are a few old pick ups 
around town with split windsheilds, one has 42 vintage plates, I saw one the 
other day painted farm green this woman was driving it, saw her on the way 
back home too and she had a lawnmower in the back. Maybe half dozen, no a 
dozen splits around, large number of bays.  Seems all the split drivers know 
each other, but then again this is a small town and if you don't want someone 
to know what you are doing, don't do it, or don't care if they know.   Any 
way the amount of VWs still on the road/around seems high even in proportion 
to the numbers made.  guess they keep going even if they are basically a POS 
design.
