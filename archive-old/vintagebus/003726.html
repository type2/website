Ok, trees go into houses and magazines. How old are the houses around
your area? 30, 40, 50 years old?  What happens to magazines (newspapers,
junkmail) that old? LANDFILL mostly. Then you buy MORE magazines to
replace the old ones. Wood pulp. The wood in a house is used every day
to keep you from dying of exposure, not tossed or even recycled because
it's in use.   I'd rather have adobe and straw bales to make a house
because it's not a rape of air cleaning plants, but the wood in my house
is still working after 60 years on the job. There was a study done by
the Journal of Irreproduceable Results about the doomsday effect caused
by TONS of Nationa Geographic magazines that will weight down the
continental shelf, causeing wide-spread subsidence of coastal areas, but
great surf from Phoenix to central Iowa. You can look it up.

Hey, Karl (aufever) and I were in Az for a couple of hours last Sunday.
Visited Amiable Andy Aguilar in Yuma. Green Dormobile at Jerome.
Acquired two front doors, cargo doors for K's '67 standard walk through,
I got one wiper pivot, two goat-sh*t covered 14&quot; wheels and a rear
church-key hole cover. On the way back through Chula Vista, I liberated
a split Westy pop top at a salvage yard from a '70s van. I'll either
install it on my '64 doublecab (threat) or sell it at the Octo meet,
Oct. 24th. Who in AZ is coming out for the cool weather besides Andy? If
it's allowed, I'll provide carbonated, grain based beverages enhanced
with hop flowers for all listees.
