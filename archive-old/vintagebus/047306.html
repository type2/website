 I have an early 59 with a 36 hp and split case tranny. Do I need the 1959
 edition or the 1955 edition of the Bentley manual? Also is it correct that
 the 1959 edition has &quot;1959&quot; on the cover and covers 1959 thru 1962? And the
 1955 edition has &quot;1955&quot; on the cover and covers 1955 thru 1958?
 
  &gt;&gt;
my 59 edition shows a tunnel case bus with a stale air 40hp engine being 
taken out  page dated 5/59.  this would be imediately post 36hp/split case

the trans section does not show split case stuff.

the change over is not 58 to 59, but at the split case/36hp to tunnel 
case/post 36hp motor in may 59.  this book does say 59 edition (it was issued 
in 59), but it is not the one you want.  you do want the 55 edition.

in the front of my 63 edition it says

this manual is valid for 1200 and 1500 transporters from January 1963

with the publication of this workshop manul, the validity of the various 
editions is as follows:

1   1953 edition     up to February 1955
2   1955 Edition   from March 1955 to April 1959
3  1959 Edition  from March (sic-is this a typo that should be May?)1959 to 
Nov1962
4   1963 Edition   from January 1963

did they make no buses dec 62?
