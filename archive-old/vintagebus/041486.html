&gt; Check out this crazy engine on the VW of Brazil web site:

&gt; 
&gt; It looks like some sort of airplane motor, but I can't translate the lingo.

The Volkswagen engines are highly trustworthy, of long duration, low
cost
and easy maintenance. It is for this reason that it has many years
that the
Volkswagen engine comes being suitable for use in experimental
aviation.
American and German companies aeronautizaram engine VW entirely,
producing
models, that offer to high powers the low rotations. Aeronautizados
engines
VW arrive to supply up to 110 HP of power and are used in
self-propelled
gliders and &quot; homebuilts &quot;.
