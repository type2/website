Subject: Re: [VB] Vinyl Graphics - Opinion

Hey Thom,

My little brother is into the &quot;jap-car&quot; sport scene. He uses vinyl graphics
on his &quot;tricked-out&quot; turbo M*tsub*sh* Ecl*pse. This allows him to easily
change designs without having to worry about re-doing that custom metallic
paint job. I have to say, they look REAL good. You can't even tell they're
not paint unless you get real close and look. I was actually planning on
using vinyl graphics with my '59 Euro Single Cab when I get to it because
of how good they look on my bro's ride. Some nice vinyl logos for the
doors... ya know. That way, if you ever sell, you can just pull 'em off. Or
if your tastes change, or your URL for that matter (yeh, I know, that 's a
stretch!), same deal.

You've already pointed out the other nice feature. That's that you can make
whatever logo or image you want yourself on your computer and can count on
it looking exactly that way on your vehicle. very nice!

Seems like there was an article in one of the rags a while back about vinyl
graphics. Didn't seem like a DIY thing though. Just one of those articles
promoting a business by &quot;showing how to do it&quot;.
