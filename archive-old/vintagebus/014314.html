Thanks Steven &amp; Thom.. I don't know why this '66 has a small nut 'cause I
don't know the history of it.  The thing is stuck in third gear because I
found that it had been run out of oil. (Clara, you're vindicated -
transmissions CAN'T be stuck in more than 1 gear!!) The shift collar had
seized.

The transmission I'm looking at is in a '64, but now you guys got me thinking
about the better ratio and the 12v thing.  Splitties are as rare as hen's
teeth around here so my prospects for another find are slim, but I think I'll
look never the less.

Eric &amp; Barb?  This would be a great addition to the archives!  Thanks if
you're out there!

If I find something new that is not mentioned here I'll post my findings.

By the way, to keep up with recent tradition, I'm putting a small nut
transmission with a stuck gear on E-Bay tomorrow.  The reserve will be set at
$45.923.  Later-

Paul...the best large nut tranny swap is to the '67.
It has the taller ring and pinion set up which equates into a better top
end on the highway at the same rpm's.
Also, you get a system that is 12Volt compatible.
There are a few minor differences...the axle rubber stops are different.
I too am in the middle of installing a '67 into a '66.  Same thing only
different I know...but I do know about the above, perhaps Eric will fill
you in on the mate up particulars.  I would think that the only possible
other difference would be the mounting for shocks...?
later

   The ebrake cables *might* be different, but since you have a '66, it
   might be the
   right setup already.
   Barb would know.
