&gt;We all join the NEATO bus club if we want a bitchin'

I continue to believe NEATO is the best early bus club in the universe, 
but for the past year we have slipped into the &quot;S*T*&quot; syndrome.  We are 
still sending out newsletters (I hope to finish the March/April 1998 
issue this week), but as you can see, they are running very late.

Our Editor has been running the club almost single-handedly for years 
and told the President and Board of Directors almost a year ago that 
with life changes (a new baby, a new house, his own business, etc.) that 
he could no longer do it all.  Nobody has stepped in to take the ball, 
so everybody has suffered, with the most noteable thing being late 
newsletters and no NEATO election this year.

I have let the website slide as well.  Initially I took the main page 
down due to bandwidth problems with my provider.  After I sorted that 
out I was just tired of the lack of cooperation.  If all this information 
has already been typed, why should I have to RE-TYPE it?

In a fit of protest I have decided not to spend any more effort on the 
website until the newsletter gets caught up.  I spoke to Tom about the
timeliness of the newsletter and he suggested calling this issue the 
June/July 1998 issue, since everyones membership is tied to the 
newsletter issue number rather than an annual renewal date.  I told him 
I would prefer we put out an issue a month until we get caught up.

So now we are doing layout &amp; production in parallel in order to get caught 
up.  Those of you in the Vintage VW Club of America know they fell in the 
same rut a few years ago and were able to get caught up this way.

Sorry about airing &quot;dirty laundry&quot; but I know there are a lot of NEATO 
members out there just as frustrated as I am, and I think they deserve to 
know what is being done to rectify the situation.

As soon as the newsletter gets caught up I will put at least as much 
effort into the website as I used to, including lots more historical 
information that I have collected.

Thanks for your understanding,

Dave
