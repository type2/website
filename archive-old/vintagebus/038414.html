[...]Ok,

But you can turn this around to another emergency situation...

---&gt; What if your brake system fails in any way that causes the fluid to
exit.  On a 1966 and earlir bus, you lost all braking...
&lt;--- Next step is to use the mechanical cable we all call the &quot;e-brake&quot; or
&quot;parking (rust in place) brake&quot;...

So, do I expect that in such situations I should worry about doing a 180?

P.S.  We won't even get into the engine braking thread on the VANAGON list,
which would also have similar 180 degree implications?

 He hit his brakes and spun 180 degrees around and ended parking
parallel to on the shoulder beside us looking very surprised in his front
wheel drive car.  Due to the ACVW having more of it's wieght on the rear
axles
there is far less possibility of the lifting of the rear end to the point of
losing the traction of the rear wheels.   Eric &amp; Barb
