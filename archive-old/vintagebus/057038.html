Subject: Re: [VB] Re: $30K Slammin Jammin Ride

Not to be a nitpick, but *technically*, he hasn't *made* a dime - at
this point, his profits wouldn't even qualify as 'pro-forma'.  On
top of that, I'm willing to bet that even after he completes the sale,
he still won't have *made* a dime (ie profit).   He can claim a pro-forma
profit once he sells it takes a one-time charge for the restoration.
(ie bought the bus for $x and sold it for $30k, ignore the $35k(?) of parts
and labor) By GAAP, he's more than likely taking a loss.

In reality, the only way to *make* money restoring cars is to charge $X/hr 
to restore someone *else's* bus.   By cranking up the price repeatedly, what 
he's *really* doing is drawing attention to his shop, and thus more business - 
that's this real value in this bus.  Kinda like those usenet trolls along the
lines of &quot;I can't believe this site (http://-----) has full frontal nudity!)
Of course everyone is going to look!

I'm of two minds on this bus: from an aesthetics standpoint, it's hideous.
Sure, it's on the cover now, but a year from now, you'll be using gloves
and salad tongs to hold the mag while you put it in the trash.  2 years
from now people will be laughing their asses off when they're looking
thru their back issues.   

OTOH, if there wasn't all this kustom 'churn', the magazines would be
out of bidness.   Like the fashion industry, it's in their best 
interest to promote the most tastless, hideous cars du jour, so that
next month, the kiddies will buy the magazine again to see what else
someone has come up with, meanwhile last month's centerfold is so much
chopped liver.   Just like centerfolds and boy bands.   Remember new
kids on the block?  It's all about churn.  Sure, you can couch it in
terms of creativity, etc, etc - but it's really just churn. 

From a technical and execution standpoint, it's an excellent bus.  The
workmanship is great.  The only problem is, it has a very short shelf
life as a show car.  That's why most custom cars you see go up for sale
almost immediately after completion - turn and burn baby.

&gt; busses he used were restorable I am sure he would have done that. Can
&gt; you imagine how much he could have made with a restored barndoor,
&gt; restored 23 window, and a restored panel all done to that quality of
&gt; finish.
