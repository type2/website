 I am interested in your evaluation of the lift as well, price, availabilty,
 stability??  Why the Pit ? I appears the jack rolls around like a
regular jack i could  use it on my slab.  Does it have an option
 for more stability like outriggers or something like  that?

 &gt; Interesting thread... I like the lift, but share concerns about safety as
 &gt; with any lift or jack. Also, it seems the ceiling and trusses would have
 to
 &gt; be quite high.  I have always envisioned a sort of narrow
stairwell/trench
