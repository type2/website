&gt;Ronnie,

I'll agree that a  bug is different than a bus but i
believe that the tests were done on a bench and not in
the car (in the book at least)though I haven't looked
at that book(or any of Bergs for that manner) in days.
I have tried both and use the stock exhaust but i can
remember my header set-up running just as well if not
a little more peppy. I thought exhaust didn't really
come into any real importance until you got into
really changing the configuration of the engine;
Larger valves, bigger carbs, porting ect. It is
interseting in your case. I assume that the motor runs
good and cool. I'll keep that in mind as i plan to run
a 1776 in the future.

   Sean, all I can say is try it. A bug (which is
&gt; what the books refer to)
&gt; is a lot different then a bus. What I say is what I
&gt; have tested and
&gt; experienced myself. I have a 1776 single port with a
&gt; PICT 34 on it and found
&gt; I had much better low end with a stock bus exhaust
&gt; then a header. Also think
&gt; about it. A beetle has 2 tailpipes, a bus has only
&gt; one. VW must have tested
&gt; the exhaust and determined that the single tip must
&gt; have given the bus more
&gt; bottom end to help move it. Same muffler, just 1 tip
&gt; verses 2.

&gt; 
&gt;  Is a 1641cc considered small bore? That's news to
&gt; me.
&gt; There is a good section on exhaust in the &quot;How to
&gt; Hot
&gt; Rod your VW&quot; that recommends an equal length header
&gt; for a 1600cc. I also seem to remember HotVW's doing
&gt; a
&gt; test a few years ago with the same results. I
&gt; couldn't
&gt; tell you about the effects on a 36 or 25Hp motor.

&gt; &gt; The problem with running a header on a small bore
&gt; &gt; bus engine is the loss of
&gt; &gt; bottom end torque. We have tested that here is AZ,
&gt; &gt; in 100 plus heat and
&gt; &gt; found that a stock muffler gives you better bottom
&gt; &gt; end and have not seen any
&gt; &gt; difference in engine temps, touch the dipstick
&gt; test.

&gt; &gt; ronnie; stock muff unless I'm running big engine
&gt; &gt; stuff, working on a design
&gt; &gt; for a big bore stock looking muffler. Did those
&gt; &gt; years ago on 356 Porsche's,
&gt; &gt; so I don't see why it can't be done on a bus.

&gt; &gt; What about a &quot;Zoom Tube&quot;? Would this clear the
&gt; &gt; bumper ok?

&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Hello All,
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; I'm running a 1641 DP in my '65 bus. It has a
&gt; &gt; stock bug exaust. The little
&gt; &gt; &gt; chrome tips are conflicting with the rear
&gt; bumper?
&gt; &gt; Is there any way to get
&gt; &gt; &gt; around this without cutting the bumper? Is there
&gt; &gt; another exaust that is
&gt; &gt; &gt; recomended? Thank you very much.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
