School buses get into accidents, and therefore go to body shops to get
repaired and repainted.  It is my belief that there is a standard
colour for school buses (a more specific standard than &quot;french vanilla
yellow&quot;).  Therefore, a body shop should be able to look up the paint
code for what that specific shade of yellow is, and provide it to him
(perhaps for a small fee, of course).  I fail to see how my previous
assertion of this could be interpreted as a joke.
