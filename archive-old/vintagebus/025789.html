NQ,
I know that you know that no one was more thrilled to read your recovery
report on your bus than I was. I was just as excited as you were just
over 2 years ago when I pulled my 65 Westy from its long slumber. It
didn't matter that I had nothing to sit on as I guided it out of the
field behind an equally old John Deere tractor. I was &quot;driving&quot; my bus
and I knew that there were many more exciting miles ahead of me. I could
tell that during your ride last summer at the Omaha VW show you were
chomping at the bit to get your own bus going. It always takes much
longer and more money than we expect but in the end if you are diligent,
patient, resourceful and even a little creative you will have a bus to
be proud of. All the talk of $20K busses in the last week seemed kind of
silly to me. My bus will never be &quot;worth&quot; that but it will always be
special. There are enough reproduction parts available that I hope to
keep her alive for a long time. 
As to the door hinges. If the hinge plate that mounts to the door jam on
the bus is intact I would suggest a new door. I had to literaly tear my
hinges off the door to get to he hinges. They were rusted solid. With
the door out of the way I was able to unscrew the hinges from the door
jam. Using a combination of heat and a witches brew of solvents and
penetrating oils I was able to get the hinges to work again. Since I had
no replacement doors at the time I got a little creative(remember that
from above). If you want a temp fix try this:
You need to remove the window frame and door paneling to get at
everything. There are several obvious screws and bolts on the outside of
the door to remove the window frame. There are also 2 small nuts up
inside the door that have to be removed.
With the window frame removed you can see what I'm talking about. Inside
the door there are reinforceing pieces that happen to have holes in them
that match up perfectly with the rivets that used to hold the door to
the hinge. Using 6 long countersunk screws, lots of washers and 2 mashed
knuckles I was able to reattach the old hinges to the door. The screws
went through the hinge into the door and through the reinforcing
brackets. Enough washers were put on the screws to properly position the
door front to back and a good tight washer and nut to hold everything
into place. As I said this is at best a temp fix but at least you can
get in and out of the bus and give your friends a ride ;)(Planning any
trips to Omaha?)

My bus may have aquired a new name. I had to rent a garage for the
winter. With all the new metal and body work that was done and
insufficient time to complete the paint it needed to get out of the
Nebraska weather. My neighbor asked if I had found a Batcave to store
the Batmobile in. Nice name. If unclaimed by anyone else, and I have
missed it if there has been, Frodo the 1965 Westy will here after be
called The Batmobile. Please let me know if you have a prior claim.
Thanks
Terry Wolfe
