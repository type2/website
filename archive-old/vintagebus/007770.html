I am hoping this post doesn't end up being a confession.

I have been mulling it over, and I've decided to be somewhat intimidated by
the sheer amount of work I need to do to properly restore and protect my '67
Kombi.  Every part I take off for cleaning or replacement, I find something
new underneath/behind it.  An endless list of bushings, boots, and seals,
rust to be neutralized in every crevice, and so many components that must be
removed to really do the job right.  I think the most daunting is the
undercarriage.  After studying the condition of things under there
(good/serviceable, but in need of P.M.), I realized that I &quot;should by all
means&quot; remove the front beam for access to the light rust that is developing
on the underfloor above.  I don't know if I can!  My garage/shop is already
inundated with parts that I've been removing, and I can't just toss all
non-VW related stuff out!  So I don't have enough space to spread my van out
in pieces....oh well.

Anyway, to make a long post short (a little late on that one, I guess!), I
am thinking I should (mostly for economical reasons) use Rustoleum
&quot;Hammerite&quot; on the underfloor, where the rust isn't really bad, it's just
there....and use the expensive POR-15 on critical spots, or where there is
really some damage  (like the door I just bought....it's really gonna be a
fun one!_at_#!*%$!   On the inside of the wheelwells will also be some kind of
rubberized undercoating.

I'll quit yammering and go to bed.

Later,  Gene
