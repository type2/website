for budget paint tips I recomend you go to http:/www.type2guy_dot_com/ (fellow 
list member) to muster some confidence, do a little research at local paint 
suppliers and dive in. I've seen lots of folks doing their own paint 
recently( owing largely to the huge cost envolved ) I've never done it but 
plan to paint one of my buses and possibly both this summer if I can afford 
the rubber. You dont Have to buy the stuff, but it seems like you would 
recoup your investment the first time out. you can always borrow or rent. 
Just my opinion.
