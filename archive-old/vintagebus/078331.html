&gt;Maybe if I had ALL the perfect tools including a lift I wouldn't be
&gt;afraid of tackling some things ..

Look at the pictures in your Bentley...even _VW_ didn't have lifts
back in the day!  (OK, they had inspection pits, but still...)

&gt;Trouble is, I would be afraid to turn the key if I did any work on it.
&gt;ESPECIALLY STEERING ..

Hmm.  It seems that you don't have a Bus problem, you have a trust
problem.  I don't think I can pay anyone to care as much as I do
about the steering or brakes on any of my vehicles.  If they screw
up the steering or brakes on my car, _they_ might be out some amount
of money, but _I_ might be DEAD.  And, if something gets screwed up,
I don't have to look too far to find the guy that did it.

Suggestion: If you have a 25th Anniversary (16th edition) or later of
the Idiot book, read the &quot;25 Years - The Mind Reels&quot; article at the
very beginning.  If you don't, read it at the library or bookstore.
Learning doesn't stop when you get out of school.
