Subject: The Westy is done!
Mime-Version: 1.0

After 2 1/2 years of work the body/paint of my 1965 Westy is done. As a first timer
 I required a great deal of help. Much of it from this list. It will have it's 
World Premier tomorrow at the Omaha VW Club Show and Shine 2000. If you are within
driving distance come to the show. We can always use a few more Splitties
at the show. I know that NQ will be there with the Murder bus. We can have a before
 and after restoration display. Tons of great door prizes. Doors open at 10:00 AM,
judging at 11:30. About a mile north of Interstate 80 on 84th St at Flashbacks
Bar and Grill. This is a fund raiser for the Nebraska Humane Society so give it 
lots of support.
