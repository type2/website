&gt;They cost about $5, and I was going to get one for my bus, if &gt;anyone else is interested-I could pick up a few and bring them &gt;back to the states. $5 plus shipping.

We took a road trip to Florida a while back to pick up some fiberglass molds for another car of mine. But I'm off the subject. We found these suction cup bud vases in a gift shop and if I have any memory  at all, I think we paid three something. Very nice vase, sort of a frosted plastic and they come in a wide variety of colors. So the bottom line here is that they are available in the states. You just have to (perish the thought) get into a tourist trap and look about for them.
