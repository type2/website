How about taking the RGB 's and the next size up plug to a good machine shop and have the hole bored to fit?Or a weld and machine shop for a fill weld and re-bore?A good welder can add metal to the hole without wrecking the box with excess heat.

I think, before I regret it, I should mention I don't blame the rebuilder for
the RGBs leaking.  With the cores he had to work with (1 totally unknown unit,
RGBs completely shot, used center section; 1 bug tranny w/RGBs, used RGBs,
PO mods and sat for 15 years) I'm happy that it works at all honestly :-)  I
think it's pretty likely that out-of-round holes is a one-off problem.  Just
a little frustrated that I may have to pull everything apart again with 
limited time (moving soon) and limited _free_ time to do it, I think everybody
could relate to that!
