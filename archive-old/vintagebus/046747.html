for a 1965 Deluxe bus would have been?  The motor would have been a 1500 with 
a rev limiter.  Second, Anyone have one FS?  third, will it make a difference 
if i run it on a 1600 engine? &gt;&gt;

Hi Matthew,
Check out:  http://www.oldvolkshome_dot_com/  
The stock 1500 distributor should work fine with your slightly bigger 1600 
engine.
