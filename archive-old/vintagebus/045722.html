&lt;&lt;I was looking at the Wolfsburg West site because the E-brake boot is missing

from my '60 Double Cab and it says the boots are from May, 1960 - up.


Is this correct?  Earlier Buses have no E-brake boot?


Thanks,

Everett Barnes&gt;&gt;

Both my 57 and 56 don't use them.
I would guess the change would have been when they swapped to the syncro 
tranny and moved the ebake/shifter position.
