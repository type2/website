Web site is back up.  I didn't even have to get mean (as if), just had to
get to someone who cared, like any other Customer Service phone call...  :)

Bus content:
It was sorta humid this morning in Phoenix, I noticed my 36hp had endless
power (possible oxymoron?), I had to actually take my foot off the pedal to
keep from going past 55 mph.  I've noticed when it's mildly humid, my Bus
seems to have more power, there's something in that...

Happy surfin',
