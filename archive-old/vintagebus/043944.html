I would never use a power wire wheel on a piston!  Do what you will your
way, but I'm pretty sure that you're the only one that would give this
advice.  Typically, the advice I've always been given is to use nothing
harder than a piece of hardwood in the shape of a wedge on a
piston.  An old ring for the ring lands is good tho.
Another one of those damn differing opinions people always seem to have!
