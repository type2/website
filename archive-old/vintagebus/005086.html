The compression runs in the 150-170 range. Maybe a
cam and flat top pistons? Runs great except when cold. Even when I let
it warm up 4 or 5 mins it still dies when stopping till its been driven
awhile. I llive in the NW so outdoor temps are mild. 40-50 degrees. The
auto choke checks out fine and mixture is ok. It has a Solex 30 pict 2.


Hi James,
Your compression sounds kind of out of line to me.  Not that it would cause
your symptoms, but 150-170 would be in the high 8s to 9 compression.  If it
was me I'd probably pull the engine and put some spacers on the cylinders or
semi-hemi the heads, but then my bus is parked for another couple of weeks
and I haven't done anything on it in months.  Carburetor kits are under $10,
so  maybe grab a kit and clean and rebuild the carburetor.  Also maybe try a
larger idle jet?  What kind of distributor are you running?


What I want to know is there a better carb that I can bolt on? Most
performance carbs I see are for dual ports. Also considering updating
the distributor? Any suggestions?

Solex carbs are much easier to work on and get parts for.  Seems to me that
the stock VW stuff is the best for reliability and simplicity, especially on
a stock single port.
