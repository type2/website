Since it's still Friday - our daughter and her friend are planning to move to 
Seattle in June after they graduate from the University of Vermont.  They are 
planning to drive their cars (one '00 Jetta and one '93 Fox) across the 
country - stopping at relatives and friends along the way.

Dick and I haven't said anything to Kate, but we aren't too sure of that Fox 
going from one side of the country to the other.  We wondered if we could 
ship it out (loaded with their belongings) so that they could at least travel 
together.

Anyone know what it costs to ship from this side to the other side?  Anyone 
know an honest mechanic in Seattle for when the Fox has trouble?  How about 
jobs!  I think the only thing they are sure of is they are going to Seattle 
(because it's not here) and they're driving!

By the way - we were visiting our son at Ft. Lewis in Tacoma, WA a couple of 
weeks ago.  We weren't able to go to the show as we were flying out that day 
but we were treated to seeing many nice Vow's on their way to the show!  Oh, 
how we envy all of you on the West coast!  Every day we were out three we saw 
more vintage vw's than we see in a whole summer around here!  It's so neat 
that you drive them!
