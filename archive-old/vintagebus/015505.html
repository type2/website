I keep seeing claims of &quot;NOS, No Longer Available&quot; for bus wiper blades on eBay,
which is setting off my BS detector.  The last time I was at the VW
FLAPS, they had them on the shelf.  Am I on glue, or are the ebay sellers?

And I'm getting a kick outta the guy who's selling an NOS engine lid prop
every 2 weeks; the last one I saw was up to $91.   The guy must have a 
truckload of them, and driving it all the way to the bank...
