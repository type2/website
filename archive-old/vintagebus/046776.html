&lt;&lt; Take the case to a machine shop knowledgeable in these cases and acceptable
 to both parties.  Let them decide if the case is usable or not.  If the
 case is usable, then the buyer pays for the inspection, keeps the case, 
 and pays the seller what he bid.  If the case in indeed trashed, the
 seller pays for the inspection, gets his case back and refunds the buyer's
 money.
 
 This would seem to be a lot more productive than taking potshots at each
 other on the list. &gt;&gt;

This sounds like the best thing said yet.  The only change I would suggest 
would be that if it was advertised as NOS it should be NOS and not just 
&quot;usable&quot;  Either way let a third party decide.
