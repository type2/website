&lt;&lt;  Also have in a pinch installed a 12 volt battery in a 6 volt bus to get 
it 
 home.  Just make sure to get the engine started ASAP and do not let the 
 ignition key stay in the power position while the engine is not running for 
 more than a minute.  We did this during daylight and only ran the signals 
 (BRIGHT!) only as needed.  The generator light would flicker slightly while 
 running, otherwise it ran fine the 50+ miles trip.   Eric&amp;Barb

did you leave the battery connected while driving and if so why?   Remember 
that white 67 westy Mike and I got from Orcas Island years ago?   The 
generator went bad and the battery drained and bus died on the way south with 
it.    So we left Moselle running (61 standard walkthrough with that 
uncomfortable not behind the steering wheel drivers seat) and switched 
batteries over so the Westy had juice to start the motor and run the lights, 
and Moselle charged up the westys flat battery.  But the point being that  
the engine kept running with the battery actually removed from the vehicle.   
suppose if you drove with the battery disconected you would want to make sure 
the battery cables didn't spark, or just take the ground strap aff the 
battery.
