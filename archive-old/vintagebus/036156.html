I'm not surprised.  I used the three following known chassis
numbers and production dates to extrapolate your date.  What I
didn't allow for shows up more clearly in the first five I know
of in the 1966 model year.

1965 Model - Chassis 170,044 - June 22
1965 Model - Chassis 174,001 - June 29 - Tuesday
1965 Model - Chassis 174,370 - July 1 - Thursday

I showed the first two of the following in my previous post, but
didn't follow through.  As the chassis numbers increase the dates
jump around and are not consecutive.  It's a phenomenon I have
not been able to fully explain, but has never been more than a
few days.

1966 Model - Chassis 000,363 - July 6 - Tuesday
1966 Model - Chassis 000,454 - July 7 - Wednesday
1966 Model - Chassis 001,090 - July 6
1966 Model - Chassis 002,667 - July 9
1966 Model - Chassis 002,686 - July 8

Can anyone offer an explanation of why they'd be making #363
and #1090 on July 6, then start #454 on July 7?

This is one of the reasons I've learned not to take VW &quot;verbatim&quot;
in their pronouncements...and the biggest reason I'm looking to
collect all the Production Plate data I can.  The NEATO Old Bus
Registry has over 300 Production Plates in a database and I'm
trying to make sense of it all.  Anyone willing to contribute,
feel free to pass along the numbers on your tags.

my theory on jumping chassis numbers and dates  is instantly adapted from my 
earier theory of jumping chassis numbers and bodu numbers.  On pre m code tag 
buses there is a body number stamped in the bulkhead behind the pass side of 
the front seat.  this body number is not the chassis number but tends to be 
quite clos eto the chassis number.    In my mindless noticing of thing it 
seemed that the numbers were closer on 'usual' models and further apart on 
'unusual models'   on a certain '56 23 window the number were quite far 
apart.  my theory is the chassis  and body numbers were applied sequencially- 
but at different times.    and due to there being different amounts of work 
to put together different models the lag can be bigger or smaller.      so 
jump this to the  m-code date thang  -  and I dont know I f i expplained t 
all that well but there it is.
