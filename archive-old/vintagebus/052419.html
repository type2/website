Subject: Cargo Door Adjustment?

Here's what I trying to figure out.  If you're looking at the right side of
the Bus with the front being to your right.  I'm trying to figure out how to
bring top of the right side cargo door to the right and up.  The left edge,
that closes with the left cargo door, seems to be sagging a bit.  Looking at
the top gap, of the right cargo door, it's larger in the middle causing some
hang up.  Trying to get this all lined up before I finish welding in the
Rocker and such.
