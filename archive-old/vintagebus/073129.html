Subject: stuck drum again

my '61 was sitting in grass for 10 years before i got
it, so there are some serious rust issues...

when i got it, the front drums would not even turn, so
i used a puller to pull them off, and found that the
drums were stuck to the shoes (bent up the adjustment
screws ripping the drum off)

the drums rotated quite well when i put them back on
without shoes.

Now, I've installed all new wheel cylinders, metal
lines, bearings, and shoes, but when i put the drum
back on it won't turn again! the adjusting stars are
turned down as small as they can go. what gives? the
drum is totally hanging up on the shoes...
will this be resolved when i put fluid in the system,
and pump the pedal a few times? 
do i need to have the inside of the drums resurfaced?
they're a little pitted and rusty, but still about 50%
shiny surface...
it's only stuck on the driver's side.

thanks for advice!
