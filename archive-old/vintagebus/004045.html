hi list,
here is my situation,   i changed the oil in my 1600, dual port, doghouse 66
bus the other day,   it is a new brazilian case, less than 7000 miles.  2
days later it is leaking pretty bad , drip drip drip, i swear i only put in
a little over  2 quarts when i changed the oil.
i jumped right on it the next day, pulled the engine in 26 minutes, took off
the shroud, and the oil cooler looked pregnant, i happened to have another
one, brand new , both of them are brazilian oil coolers, so i put it on, put
it back together,reinstalled (3hours total time on gravel), and bam, it
worse than before,
now it is pouring out of the left side, so im thinking maybe the seals arent
right, so next day i pulled the engine again, and i had left a washer on the
stud that the oil cooler adapter goes on, so i though hmm, i tightened the
oil cooler extra tight, put it back together no improvement, arghhhh, its
worse, so im thinking that maybe im crazy and it s the front seal, but it
isnt, there is absolutely not a drop of oil around the flywheel.
i took it out a third time today, and replaced the adapter seals, no luck,

the oil is clearly coming from the left side with the main drip coming from
the place where the bottom tin screws into the block, and its dripping down
the front of the tin directly under the oil cooler and running down on to
the tranny mount.  It looks as though the new oil cooler is leaking on the
inside down from where the top 2 studs from the adapter go through it, there
is a little pool of oil on the inside at the bottom stud of the oil cooler,
but the oil is so clear and new that by the time the engine is out it is
very hard to see where it is coming from.
I have searched the archives for hours, and i apologize for this boring
post, but i really need to know the following:
1) is there something i should know about brazilian oil coolers, are they
notoriously bad or something?
2) could i have ruined the new oil cooler by tightening it down too much to
the adapter?
3) which doughnut seals are the right ones for attaching the adapter to the
block?
4) any suggestions ?

im sure someone out there  has gone through this, the one good thing is that
removing and installing the engine is nothing to me now, i hardly even break
a sweat, :o).
