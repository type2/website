I finished my headliner this weekend.  Looks great.
I got all my interior panels.
I still have to cover them, but I have them.
They are beautiful.  Fit excellent and have all the holes for the
Deluxe trim already in the correct places.

I got them from Lenny at West Coast Classics (714) 871-1322.
Lenny was very helpful and has given me alot of advice and tips.
I like dealing with VW enthusiasts like him.  Very knowledgable guy.
These panels were $275 for everything.  I mean every panel.
He even made the pieces for behind the sunvisors for me.
This is a simple piece, but with nothing to start with I was lost.

Jeff at the Bus Barn has been very helpful finding rare parts.
And he has done alot to save me money on parts.  If I need anything
I just call (714) 870-6260 and Jeff will get it for me.

The folks on this list, Steve, Clara, and many others have been
not only helpful but friendly as well.

I feel at home here on the list.
Thanks all!
