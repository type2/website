Subject: 64 SC Turning Radius Findings

WOW I was wrong twice last week, wife was out of town, that must have
been it. No I'm wrong allot of the time, any way...

I drove the truck this weekend and determined the turning is less to the
left, only 3/4 of a turn, then to the right it's 1 1/2 turns, in fact it
has been turned a few times to hard to the right because I have a rub
mark on the right tire from where it scrub on the frame.

I also looked at my Drag link to see if it was bent, and yes it's bent
but it looks as if it should have a curve, however mine has been rubbing
underneath enough to scrape away some paint. I could not tell by the bbb
how mine was suppose to look, I might have missed that page.

So with these new findings can someone shed new light on it for me? Any
one know of a good photo of a Drag link so I can compare mine?

Meredith
