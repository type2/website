Well the same thing happened to me, but I was in my Bug on I-10, and I was
doing about 55 at 5pm (merging into rush hour) traffic. I didn't even go
near my bug for 4+ months.  I was so d_at_mn scared, and shaken up that I
didn't even want to look at it.  First you need to check the rubber brake
line.  The reason my lug nuts backed off is because the rubber brake line
would let fluid go through, but not let it return back to the Master
Cylinder.  Well, this kept the brakes engaged, and it heated up the drum so
much that the lug nuts just popped right out.

I spun a complete 405 deg around (1 1/4 turn) and I still have the suck
marks in the seat to prove it.  I finally did get over it, and I drive my
oval regularly.   If you make it to Ennis, look me up.  If everything goes
right, I'll be the one with the ugly, semaphore'd, ragtop, oval.

&gt; Is this gonna go away? I feel good about my work, but I'm just nervous for
&gt; some reason. Anybody else ever have this?
&gt;
&gt; I had planned on driving from San Angelo to Ennis for the bug-in on may
&gt; 6th. I think it's about a 500 mile round trip drive. I'm gonna do it
&gt; regardless...I just hope I can &quot;get it together&quot; so I can enjoy the drive.
