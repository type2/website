 The leak is actually in the weld between the carb and the rubber seals, best
 I can tell. Is this possible? Get it fixed, replace it, or upgrade it?
 
 Thanks,

sounds like you mean in the center section of the intake manifold.  Inward of 
the rubber boots that join the center to the  parts that bolt directly to the 
head.

I would replace it.  Can pick one up cheeap at a swap meet, or probably some 
local VW head has an extra lying around.

Unfortunately, as you have to pull the generator out of the way, it sounds 
like time to pull the motor.  But pulling the motor is no big deal.

are you sure exactly where the drip is?  I would not think that the maifold 
crack would leak gas, it would actually cause an intake leak, making the 
engine run lean, and/or badly ya?  Perhaps the is coming from the carberator, 
dripping onto he manifild underneath?
