Subject: arkestra in ark, 2

Well, its Friday, so time for a trip report!
Once again I had the pleasure of being the driver for the Sun Ra Arkestra
(under the direction of Marshall Allen); besides the joy of seeing these
amazing men in action , I got to hear 50 years' worth of tales 'on the
road,' and all the philosophical underpinnings of the Arkestra.
Bonus time was having saxman Charles Davis yelling &quot;Shift! Shift!!&quot; as I
accellerated on to a freeway - it turns out he used to own an early bay. We
had a good time discussing valve float and rebuilds.  BTW- I was only at
3600 rpm :).
THEN Ya-Ya asks &quot;Did we ever tell you about the time we got picked up by
hippies in one of these?&quot;  It turns out the the band was en route from
Michigan to New York when their vehicle broke down; a splittie bus with two
weedy hippies stopped, and they loaded 11 men and all their horns, drums
and whatnots in, on and around the van!!!  They made it in time for the
gig, though they said it was a little uncomfortable with all the gear
poking at them. They said VWs were luxuries, compared to SOME of the things
they've ridden to gigs in!

My bay had 9 men and all their horns in it; ran 75 mph on the freeway (took
a while to get there, tho), stopped on a quarter and never got too hot to
touch  - though I only really ran it wideopen for around  45 minutes.

Nabbed more of them into signing the Sliding Door Of Jazz... I make all the
jazz musicians who get rides from me sign on that curved metal part, just
below the window.  I'll try and get a jpg up later today for those
interested......
