Subject: Re: [VB] Top Speed

Most 65 buses are happy cruising 60mph.  However, I dunno if your bus has 
stock gearing for a 65.  usually he trans has been swapped out at some point in 
the last 40 years.  Some people like to drive higher rpms, some like to keep it 
to lower rpms (in the interests of longetivity and gas milage)  The gearing 
is as important as the engine for speed.  

  Usually a 1600 is a good choice.     However it is often the same cost to 
buy a rebuildt one or to buy the parts to rebuildt it.  

You may enjoy the &quot;How to keep your VW Alive&quot; Book by John Muir... very 
useful and with excellent illustrations.


&gt; 
&gt; I have a 65 Bus that I am working on.  Have quite a bit of work to do before
&gt; I am road worthy.  I was reading that the top speed of the bus is 60 miles
&gt; and hour?  Is this correct with a 1600 engine?  I need to rebuild the engine
&gt; - any suggested sources of information for a very visual person?
