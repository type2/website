Subject: 1600 air cleaner
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

Hey everyone-
I've got a 1600 dp w/ a 34 pict3 carb and I want an oil bath air cleaner for 
it---
We all know they work best in everyday stock conditions, but I was wondering 
what year bus oil baths will work?
I am looking for a complete assembly w/ all the connectors/support tubes etc. 
. . 
Does anyone have a complete one?

Thanks-Pete
