Subject: Researching the front end rebuild.
Date: Fri, 31 Mar 2000 10:40:59 -0600

I've been researching this front end rebuild for my 67 bus and man, it's
kind of scary - a lot of parts and a lot to do.  I'm pretty sure I'm going
to go so far as to have the beam sandblasted and then treat it with POR15.
Heck - maybe even powdercoating if I feel like it.

Anyway, I've spent about half an hour pouring over Bentley and the RMMW
catalog.  I can pretty much understand the kingpin rebuilding process but
what I'm in doubt about are the axle tube ends. The Bentley talks about a
conglomeration of reaming, bushings, seals, special tools, etc. and now I'm
left wondering if I haven't gotten in too deep.  I forget who it was I
talked to awhile back that said that they rarely even touched these needle
bearings.  I know if I fail to check them though, it'll come back to bite me
and I'll have to tear it all down again.  Anyone know how I would go about
check for slop

I'm sure I can rebuild this front end but if someone offered a completely
rebuilt front end, I'd sure be tempted to buy it.  I'll keep you all posted
on how things go.
