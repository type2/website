Subject: Re: [VB] Ever heard of this old manual?

There's a copy of the fuel injection manual on Ebay right now.  Only $6.75
at the moment.

&gt;Judith Noah, the PO of my bus, gave me this book copyright 1963.  It's in
&gt;sorry shape but all there.  It's called:  Volkswagen Technical Manual by
&gt;Henry Elfrink 10th edition.

I have copies of Henry's 'Volkswagen Technical Manual' (Eleventh Enlarged
Edition, September 1964), 'Volkswagen Type 1, 1300, 1500 &amp; 1600 Technical
Manual' (Fourth Enlarged Edition, 1971), and 'Volkswagen Type 3 Technical
Manual' (Third Enlarged Edition, 1971).

The 'Volkswagen Technical Manual' is an updated version of 'All About The
Volkswagen', which I don't have a copy of.

Also by Henry: 'Porsche Technical Manual', covering 356 A, B, &amp; C models.
'Volkswagen Fuel Injection Technical Manual', covering VW Types 3 and 4,
and Porsche 914.  I don't have these either, but according to the promo
inside the back cover, they can be ordered for $3.00 - $5.00 per copy,
postpaid...  :-)

I think these are great books.
