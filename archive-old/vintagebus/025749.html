I have been wondering the same thing.  The only problem I've discovered is the
options for colors is far more limited with p.c.  I figured the options were to
p.c. the bumpers and rims (should be the same color, silver white right?) or
paint.  I can get the right color paint, but not the right color p.c.  If you can
find silver white in a p.c. color, please let me know.  I seems much better to do
that, lasts a whole lot longer and is much tougher than just painting.
