Subject: RE: [VB] Backup lights on 67 deluxe

I thought all '67s had rectangular BU lights above the tail lights.  The
ones in the pic are &quot;custom&quot;.  

Do you have the normal ones for a '67?  Any one know if VW was consistent on
this?

Remember, I am new to this stuff:
I have been watching close at backup light configurations, and I have not
seen this on anyone's yet. Is this a special setup, or am I just not finding
anything similar.
I have this one in good condition, the other is busted. I have replacement
brake lights, but the white backup light, is it unusual or just not used
anymore?
