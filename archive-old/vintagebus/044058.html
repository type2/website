Well, I missed the first note in this series so I don't know what the
rules are, but it seems to have something to do with counting busses
and/or other vehicles. Here are my VW's:

1959 VW Single Cab. 1600/tunnel conversion. Ratty but it runs. Well,
it did before I decided to put a new tranny in it. Haven't quite
finished that project yet. &lt;http://www.bobrk_dot_com/otto/&gt;

1969 VW Westfalia. Nearly original. Stool, tent, rear door screen, kid
cot. Only thing missing is the storage net. First offer over $10k
takes it. Just kidding, it ain't for sale!

Not VW's, but close in the fun category:

1982 BMW R65LS motorcycle. Think of it as having half a vw engine
cylinders and twice the carburetors. Definitely a boxer.

1992 Mazda Miata. More fun than a barrel of monkeys and reliable to
boot. It's a 1600 as well, but with twice the power of my busses.
