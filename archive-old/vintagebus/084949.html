Subject: Re: [VB] VW want to remove entusiast site

Hmmmmmmmmm.......
 First, Volks Cafe (now Van Cafe as of this week). Now this.
 The BS just keeps rollin' on &amp; on &amp; on &amp; on..........
 No wonder they can't put out a good product anymore. Seems like they spend
the majority of their time doin' crappy legal stuff and not concentrating on
customer satisfaction or their wants.
 [big sigh]

&gt; Hy type 2 friends.
&gt;
&gt; Recently here im Brazil, the VW decide to use the power of a big
&gt; corporation
&gt; (as it is here) and remove the site
www.kombi_dot_com.br&lt;http://www.kombi_dot_com.br&gt;from been published
&gt; from his owner, one type2 entusiast. The VW want just to redirect the
&gt; adress
&gt; to his comercial site www.vw_dot_com.br &lt;http://www.vw_dot_com.br&gt; . As we know,
&gt; the comercial site does
&gt; not have the type 2 story or any information available to entusiasts.
&gt; Looks like they dont care to the past, only care to sale sale sale...
&gt;
&gt; The reason i was wrighting is to ask you Type 2 lovers, &quot;to post a coment
&gt; in
&gt; the site,&quot; just to show there are people who cares for the past, the
&gt; history, the information, the friendship aroud these world of old volks.
&gt; Also to encourage the site owner to keep fighting for what he believes.
&gt;
&gt; The site is about one and a half year, and he is just trying to do
&gt; somthing
&gt; nice, slowly but nice. He have no sponsors or donations from no one. Is
&gt; all
&gt; made with his own money and has no comercial aproach as you can see.
