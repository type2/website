Sheeet bro-hams.

That seat's nothing.
All this talk got me rifling through the pics of the
SOTO show and of a Double door 23 window which was
there (anyone remember it?) The guy said he had it
shipped out from Michigan, just had it repainted and a
new headliner (mohair?!) installed. The interior is
ORIGINAL.

Damn nice bus.

(no affiliation, never done business nor had a beer
with the guy just listened to what he had to say)
Here's the pics

Oh yeah, I also found a couple of &quot;Birthing&quot; pics of
DARTHVW. Rather, the shots of them loading him/her off
the trailer, and I had to throw them in for gratuitous
&quot;my&quot; bus shots.

Enjoy.
Spend your money wisely folks.

67 21 window &quot;DARTH--better money spent than the $350
I blew on an MIB Evel Knievel Stunt Cycle-VW&quot;
