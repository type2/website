Subject: transaxle swap

This week I decided to swap the transaxle in my '59 Kombi out with a 
spare I've had sitting in my barn. It was supposed to be a good one 
and from a '67.

I ordered new mounts and axle boots from Ronnie. I swapped the whole 
transaxle and then bounced my brake parts over to the &quot;new&quot; one. 
Finally got things done enough for a test drive tonight.

It seems like it's generally better than my other. Downshifting from 
3rd to 2nd once again causes a grind like in my old tranny. My other 
one had worn so bad that shifting from 1st to 2nd would grind unless 
I let the engine wind WAY and caught it right...which I had gotten 
pretty good at. This new one seems to have some shifting issues with 
2nd gear as well. Seems if I don't get it in there right it'll 
pop-out. I'm gonna try and adjust my shifter plate to see if I can 
work it out. Hopefully that will be the case.

Other than that the tranny seems to shift through all 4 gears just 
fine. I couldn't get up to top speed 'cause my brakes need to finish 
being adjusted. But I got up to 45 and things seemed OK. Cleaner more 
accurate shifting. This tranny sounds a little different than my 
other...and it also doesn't give me the &quot;tranny brake affect&quot; the old 
one did...it's there...just not as much.

So it SEEMS this one is in generally better condition and has less 
wear...but there's really no way to know for sure. My other was a big 
nut too.

I guess time and a little driving will tell for sure. If anyone can 
remember how to adjust that shift plate...like which direction does 
what...let me know. I'll try and work it all out tommarrow and get my 
bus back on the road.

I think the hardest part of the whole thing for me was trying to get 
the reduction gear box to spring plate bolts back in. Tough getting 
'em lined up and all that. Did it though.

One thing I did do was after my wheels/tires were off I lowered my 
bus as close to the ground as possible and worked on it like that. 
made swapping the trannys and stuff real easy for a one man deal.

That's it for now. Any comments welcome.
