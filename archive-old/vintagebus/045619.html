With all these complaints, is anyone going to talk to the GG chapter and 
maybe help them make some changes for the future? Tell them how disappointing 
it was? And by the way, after last Kelley Park, wasn't there word that the 
show would definitely be moved this year for the sake of more room?

I know a couple people in that club and we were talking a month or so after 
the Kelley Park show.  They said it is amazing how much it has grown.   They 
are having problems with the city / KPbeauracracy re having the place for a 
car show.  They also think it is a great place for a show (on the glass, 
rather than a hot parkig lot,  occasional shade trees, victorian buildings)   
But the show is too big for everyone to drive in now.  SO will they move to 
another, larger,concrete place?  Or limit who can drive in?   What criteria 
for who can drive in?  25 years or older ?    show/swap only?   (but why 
shove the Daily driver people out?)

Then again, I was less than over joyed waiting in line for hours to not be 
able to drive in.  Pre registation? Now theres a concept.  Then again most 
shows have organisation problems.  I think we should just be glad that so 
many are put on, and a lot of them by clubs!!!! and there are some people 
doing hardwork to help make these happen.  get involved with putting on your 
local shows.
