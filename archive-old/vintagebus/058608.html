Subject: Petronix testing


Hi all, renoir here.

I have had a Petronix breakerless system for two years with no problems.
Could this just go out for no reason?
I hear an electronic click, when I rotate the engine by hand with the ignition on but no spark at the 
plug.

How can I test the module?

thank you.
