One other thing; somethin' I read or was told a long time ago, was to
always start bleeding the longest run from the MC and work toward the
shortest (ya know, rt. rear to lft. frt.). I have been a mindless slave
to this command, never questioning whatever authority it was that handed
down this edict. Here, you weren't after air bubbles per se, but
flushing the system, but you started at the front. So I wonder if the
order makes any difference. Is it different for bleeding air vs.
flushing? Have I been a sheep, following without questioning, this
instruction? If I have been a sheep, does that mean I've been _bleating_
the brakes? (Oh gawd, that was BAAAAD! :)

i don't know.     But I did it the front first this time, though usually I do
the back first.  cept I am told you should bleed the front first in a dual
circuit system.   Never could quite follow why.

    But I like the rope trick, though I knew Todd would show up that day so I
figured I could invegle brake bleeding help out of him.  ANyway, the brakes
are nice and not squishey and stop the bus.
