&lt;&lt; &gt; Anyone have a piece of original safari glass that they would be willing 
to

send me a pattern of?  I have misplaced mine and need to get some new glass

cut for my 65.

&gt;

Speaking of that, I have a question, someone told me about a month ago that

original Safari glass is thinner than original windshield glass.  True?


Interested,
