The best I can offer is:

http://www_dot_calweb_dot_com/~thom/cgi-bin/gallery-search.cgi?string=roof+rack

Also, a search on &quot;westy&quot; or &quot;westfalia&quot; will turn up other pix of buses
with early racks.

&gt; Ok I have here talk about this slanted (westie) roof rack from time to time.
&gt; I do not believe I have seen one. I searched a few of the VW sites trying to
&gt; find a picture of one but was unable to locate one. Does anyone have one
&gt; they could snap a few pics of, or a link to where a picture already is?
