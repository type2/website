Subject: Happy-Bird Day &amp; Bus 1/3-2/3rd Seat?

Received a call yesterday in the middle of changing oil in a very reluctant 51 bus.  Seems
it had been years since the oil change plate was ever removed--But enough of that from
TWWM--The call was regarding a 1/3-2/3rd Front seat for a splitty- If anyone needs one,
near the Shores of Phoenix -
e-mail me for the info--i think the price was around $50--uj
