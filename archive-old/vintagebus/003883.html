Met this young man (I can say that since I'm not so young at 32!
-)  )
through eBay and he really wants a bus. Since I won't be finding
_anything_ rust free, much less a bus here in FL, thought some of you
guys might be able to help.  Hey, he's got $3000.00---pretty good
start! :-)  BTW, He's in Michigan if that helps. Thanks!
 Michele

&gt;Hello Michele,  My name is Kevin...
if you ever see any thing
&gt;for sale in Florida, could you please write me and tell me, I am
looking for
&gt;something nice, without rust, which is hard to come by in Michigan,
the only
&gt;problem is I have a price range, because I still have to pay for
school and stuff, even though I'd rather be driving around in a VW!!!
The highest I could probably go is around $3,000, and that is
stretching it.  I really appreciate your time...   Thanks--Kevin--
&gt;
You can reach him at VWMonkey_at_aol_dot_com.
