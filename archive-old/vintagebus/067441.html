Posted a message on Friday, but have gotten no responses, so perhaps it 
did not go out to the list properly?

My friend Tommy Tarka is stuck in Denver with his new 67 splitty. He is 
having some bottom end noises that he does not like (rod nock perhaps), 
and could use some help. If anybody has a source for a cheap bottom end 
please let me know ASAP (916-989-3931), or give him a call at: 
858-344-9659. He has to be back to DC by Tuesday, so things are not 
looking good for him.

Thanks,
-Nick
