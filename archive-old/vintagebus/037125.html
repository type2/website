Hi Andre,
Does look like a Sundial or simular conversion out of a panel.  Be carefull 
of changing interior and body stuff.  You might decide later you made a 
mistake throwing something away.  Would also be a real good idea to check 
behind the interior panels especially the cargo ones for insulation like foam 
rubber, fiber glass, or others that act like a sponge.  We have a 1963 panel 
that once had a camper conversion of some type in it and the use of foam 
rubber as insulation held moisture against the roof especially the lower 
edges just above the rain gutter.  Result we have a bus that we have to 
replace at least 3/4 of the roof if not the entire roof.   Eric&amp;Barb
