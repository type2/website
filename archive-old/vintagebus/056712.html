Subject: Re: [VB] Engine Break In

This is a brand new motor?   I'd do what the idiot book says and run 30 wt 
non detergent for two hundred miles.  
 Then I prefer Castrol, other people have another favourite brand.  
 Weight of oil depends on your climate/ temperature.

This time of year I am using 30 wt.  here we are generally in the 40s to 50s F

I wouldn't bother pulling the motor to retorque it at 200 miles.   If you 
want to double check the bottom head bolt  torque ya go ahead at the first 
valve adjustment, but it is still breaking in at 200 miles.  If you wnat to 
pull and torque wait till 2,000, though Myself I'd wait till 10,000.

Congrats on getting the beast going!   Hooray!

 After a long hiatus our 63 Panel is nearly ready to go.  8-years it has 
 languished: garaged in Winter, driveway in summer... my son has redone the 
 entire underside in corrosion protection, new electrical, rebuilt trans and 
 redux boxes, pedal assemblies, brakes, hoses... a long row to hoe.
 
 So now, it is time to break in the engine... we have &quot;heard&quot; stories of 
 different weight oils to help with the break in period... and now it is time 
 to hear from the list.  What weight oil and why?  We are going to go with 
 Gene Bergs recommendation to go 200 miles and then pull to  retorque but 
 some have &quot;commented&quot; lighter oil for break in others not.  Constructive 
 opinions plz... Clara if you could, Ronnie? Thom?  I respect many of you out 
 there so make your opinion known and remember to say why... just an oil 
 weight is not going to cut it.  Blame it on my son the Machinist... sigh.
 
 This list is killer... don't know if there are any Willie N fans out there 
 but remember the tune... &quot;On the road again&quot;?
