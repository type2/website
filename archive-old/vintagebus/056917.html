Subject: Re: [VB] Whiter shade of pale

First off, I'll fess up that I need to do some work
on the registry.  I need to sub-divide some options by
year, because some codes were re-used.

&gt; I have a '63 single cab that is a white color.  It's whiter than my Pearl White 
&gt; '65 camper.  The plate inside merely says WHITE.  When I entered this into the 
&gt; vintagebus registry, it translated out to &quot;Lotus White.&quot;  paintscratch_dot_com says 
&gt; there was L84 White, L87 Pearl White, L82 Silver White but no Lotus White for 
&gt; that year.  Any thoughts as to the true color?
