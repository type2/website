I don't think anyone replaced your buses divider. The M-code plate was
probably replaced. Why? Who knows? You might have someone else's plate on
your bus. Look on the overhead unit from the passenger side. There should be
another plate with Style number and other numbers on it. Check the numbers
there. Check guys on your busses as this plate might belong to one of you.
I'm still looking for mine with chassis number 1276786. Anybody????

&gt;
&gt; I am thoroughly confused about the year of my bus!  I had sent a message
&gt; to the list ealier saying that the VIN of my bus was 282407, but after I
&gt; looked at the actual title I noticed that it said 200632.  So I decided to
&gt; investigate.
&gt;
&gt; I went out to the bus and lifted the front seat and looked behind the
&gt; passenger side to see the number 282407 stamped into the metal.  Next I
&gt; went back to the engine compartment and looked at the front of the
&gt; compartment at the VIN plate and noticed it had 200632 stamped on it and
&gt; right beneath it on the frame (body).
&gt;
&gt; So my conclusion is that the divider behind the front seat was replaced at
&gt; some time of the buses life.
&gt;
&gt; Also, where can I find the m-codes for this bus?  I have never owned a
&gt; bench-seat splitty, yet alone one as old as this one.
