&gt; Here's a link to the page showing the sunroof bus- bottom of the page has
a
&gt; great interior shot.

&gt;
&gt; &gt; ya- Dan has a point there-  is the number you wrote the one from the
&gt; engine
&gt; &gt; compartment?  the one in the engine room is the VIN
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; one is a very late 58, as July 31st/ VIN 375 089 is the model year
change
&gt; &gt;  ( or is it 384  875 at the bumper change?)   Does the later one have a
&gt; body
&gt; &gt; number stamped behind the passenger side of the front seat?   It may
have
&gt; an
&gt; &gt; m code tag.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; The earlier one, it doesn't have a tube for the shift rod, right?
Under
&gt; the
&gt; &gt; bus.
&gt; &gt; The earlier one should have the rare flat decklid, while the later one
the
&gt; &gt; mid 58 through later 64 decklid
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I am a bit confused by fascination of wanting factory codes.  That
earlier
&gt; &gt; bus has codes for standard with sunroof, ambulance divider, from what
you
&gt; &gt; say.   8 seater- then it would have code for 2/3 middle seat (9 seaters
&gt; has
&gt; &gt; three rows of seats for three- meaning full front seat and full middle
&gt; seat-
&gt; &gt; 7 seater has walkthrough front seat (hard to fit ambulance divider) and
&gt; 2/3
&gt; &gt; middle seat.)
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Sounds like a couple neat buses,   any pics?

&gt; &gt;  295464 = October '57
&gt; &gt;  369810 = July '58
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;  These are CHASIS numbers, the one from the engine compartment, not the
&gt; BODY
&gt; &gt;  number which is behind the front seat on the passenger side.  You'll
need
&gt; to
&gt; &gt;  verify those are the numbers you sent.

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;  Hi all,
&gt; &gt;     I have two early type 2's  both are registered as 1958, one with VIN
#
&gt; &gt;  295464 and the other 369810.  They are supposedly early '58 both have
&gt; &gt;  pressed bumpers, the later is a camper.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;    The 295464 bus has factory sunroof, ambulance partition, no
skylights,
&gt; and
&gt; &gt;  is an 8 passenger bus with standard trim.  Can anyone help determine
the
&gt; &gt;  year of this one, possibly the option codes, or does anyone know where
I
&gt; can
&gt; &gt;  find this information?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;  Any help would be greatly appreciated.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;  -Dan
