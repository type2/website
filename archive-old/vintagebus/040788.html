Subject: Check your brake lines!

Thursday morning when I was stopped at a traffic light with my foot on the
brake, the pedal of my '68 crew cab suddenly dropped all the way to the
floor.  Literally moments earlier, I had been driving down a steep
mountainside road that ends at a &quot;T&quot; intersection with a major highway.  If
the brakes had failed a few minutes sooner, I would have plowed full-speed
into a busy highway intersection (and probably into the building across from
it).

The culprit was a rusty brake line.  A rust hole that had formed in a
section of metal brake line above the transaxle, relatively hidden from view
unless you were specifically looking for it.  I was losing all of my brake
fluid while driving and didn't know it. Funny, the brake lines that were
more visible didn't look as rusty. Perhaps someone had replaced them along
the way but missed the bad one because it wasn't as noticable.  I overlooked
it too until the unexpected brake failure.

Be warned.  Check your brake lines if you haven't looked at them in a while.
