I've got a 36HP solex carb on ebay. It's only got a few hours left 
and it's at $2.00.  http://cgi.ebay_dot_com/ebaymotors/aw-cgi/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&amp;item=471855814
&gt;
I tried for it Rex!  Oh well, I ran it up for you.

That was an early one too, before they said &quot;PCI&quot; on the side.
