Subject: Tranaxle Hunt

In lieu of the trip to Jerome and beyond this
September, I am begining the new transaxle hunt. I am
looking for a great shop that will have them with the
redux boxes too. All gone through and with a taller
4th. I have heard that ITS in Socal is a good one. I
would appreciate prices too, if available.
