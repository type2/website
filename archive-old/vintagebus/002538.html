List
This last weekend was such good time. We had three vw shows in the Seattle
area. I brought my digital camera to the second and third ones (northwest
vintage &amp; Seattle International Raceway meets) I have placed some of the
vintage pics on a web page and will up load the SIR pics soon (drag racing
66 kombi).
Nothing of a web page but some great buses. Feel free to copy them for your
own collections if so desired
