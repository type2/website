Subject: Re: gas guage

Thanks everyone for your advice.  MY intent is for the gauge to look stock so
hopefully someone will not want to remove it. I will save the piece of metal
just incase.

-Tom Purdum
  Don't worry about exactly where the gauge goes stock.   The 58 I pulled the
sender/guage out of had it slightly off.   It wasn't factory installed, the
hole wasn't painted on the inside, and had cloth wiring (unlike the camper
with the clock, which was factory installed)
