&lt;&lt; right now it's on jackstands, something's rubbing on the right front 
brakedrum and I can't wrestle it off the hub. Any thoughts on the above would 
be appreciated.  &gt;&gt;
Hi John,
Have you backed off the brake shoes adjusting stars?  After a while the shoes 
wear an area into the drum leaving a ridge in the drum that catches the drum 
on the properly adjusted shoes.    Eric&amp;Barb
