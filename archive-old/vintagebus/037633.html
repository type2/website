Subject: Re[2]: Oil temp. sender Q 


In a message dated 98-06-23 11:55:04 EDT, you write:

&lt;&lt; I want to put in a oil temp gauge.  I took a look at what I could on the
 archives ( when the search is running :p ) and it seems the recommended 
 solution is to use the dip stick sender?  Opinions were not conclusive.  I 
 had a oil relief valve sender a long time ago in another VW, any pros/cons 
 on either one?
  &gt;&gt;
Hi Everett,
The relief valve and sump plate are on the bottom of the oil, which is going 
to be cooler.  Also the air current and water splash from the tires under the 
engine will cool this reading also.  The dip stick will read the upper layers 
of oil, but the readings one really wants is the oil going to the bearings. 
The best place for a temp sender is to install it in one of the case plugs 
near the idiot light sender.  This would mean getting shavings into the case 
so the best time to do this is when the engine is apart.  Right now we are 
running our temp, pressure and idiot light on a brass T-fitting were the idiot 
light sender goes.  We have to machine the T-fitting to take all three senders 
and when installed we make sure that the temp sender it is the upper position 
so it gets all the heat coming into the fitting.  Eric &amp; Barb 

***********

The problem with installing the sender using a T-fitting at the OP sending 
unit is that there is not any oil flow going past the sender.  Once the engine 
is running the T-fitting is a dead-end for the oil.  Once the fitting is 
filled with oil the pressure will keep that same oil in the fitting.  The 
temperature that you will be reading will be from the fitting which will come 
from part oil and part engine case.

Additionally, this is not the temperature of the oil going to the bearings, it 
is the temperature of the oil going to the oil cooler.  The OP switch is 
located on the galley that runs from the oil pump to the cooler.

All in all, on a stock engine there isn't a 100% accurate location to measure 
oil temperature.  All of the locations will be inaccurate do to radiated 
heating or cooling.  I personally prefer the oil plug on the sump for two 
reasons:  1) there is exceptional oil flow, and 2) it's where Porsche puts 
their temp sender.  I figure they probably know what they're doing. ;)
