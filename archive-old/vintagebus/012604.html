Subject: Gas Guage Woes (67 12v guage)
Message-ID: &lt;19990408174041.24063.rocketmail_at_web205.mail.yahoo_dot_com&gt;

Symptoms:
Gas Guage does not work
In process of changing ignitions noticed that the
guage would register for a breif second and than go
back to zero.
The guy said the guage worked before he put the engine
and transmission in.  Is there an easy ground to look
for?  My 63-67 Bentley is back ordered. All help is
greatly appreciated
