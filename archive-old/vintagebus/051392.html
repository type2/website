&lt;&lt;  Most original window rubber that not only adorned our VWs, but was once
 stocked at the dealerships had molded corners which cost more money due to
a
 more complicated molding system like as must be used for tail light seals.
&gt;&gt;

if you ever get an NOS seal and have the pleasure of installing it you will
see how much better molded corners are.
