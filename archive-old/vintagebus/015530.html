Subject: Is 1960 right?

I have an interesting situation here. I have what the M-Codes say to be a 
1960 camper. It has clear bullet signals in the front and a set of round 
tailights with the reflectors built in in the back.  Bumpers are american 
style with overriders and the spot for poles for the tent. The M-Codes also 
say FR for what I consider to be France. What is the deal with the lights? 
Is this what I would expect to see normally on a 1960 westy so-23, I have 
heard about light arrangements that were two taillights and two reflectors, 
before the reflectors were built in to the taillights.what about the bumpers 
are these right or is my bus from France. I would be suprised if it was.
