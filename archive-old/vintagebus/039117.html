Subject: No rear turn signal lights in a 1967 bus
Date: Mon, 25 Sep 2000 07:25:40 -0400

I am trying to figure out a cheap way to make my rear turn signal lamps
work.  I do not have the proper relay in this '67 bus.  In fact, there is NO
relay for the rear turn signal lights.  The front turn signals work, but the
relay is a non-standard (for a VW) generic turn signal relay.  I plan to
build a circuit using off the shelf relays to drive the rear signals.

I need to know how the lights are supposed to work.  If I understand
correctly, the break light and the turn signal light is the same bulb with
two filaments.  Is that correct?  I think that the break light function is
totally independent of the turn signal/tail light function.  Correct???
When the lights are off, and a turn signal is sent (via the turn signal
switch) to the bulb, the bulb will flash on and off.  When the lights are
on, the turn signal will cause the light to flash off and on.  Correct???

I am thinking about using two auto relays, with the turn signal picked up
from the working front signal.  This will pick-up the appropriate relay, and
flash the rear lamp.  Will this work??  What other considerations do I need
to think about?  Does anyone have any other suggestions?

Thanks,

Stuart Neil
