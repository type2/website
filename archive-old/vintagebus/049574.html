Erin - just to show you that nothing works as planned, MY 1600,  I sprung
for Berg weight-matched rods and pistons, and I STILL get more vibration
than I like at idle. I'm gonna pull it soon and see if the flywheel can be
balanced better on there, otherwise it just won't last as long as I'd
hoped. Likely I failed to get the CCs just right (tho they are w/in 2cc of
each other, best as I could measure).

My guru said get it as close to specs as you can with OUT spending money
and then DON'T worry about it :)

That bit of mismatch on the heads you have, I wouldn't worry about.
