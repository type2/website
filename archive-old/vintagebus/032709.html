yes, but wcm charges WAY WAY more than the dealer. i think form the dealer
they are less than $10 and thru wcm they are over $60 or more for a set,
and i believe wcm gets them through vw anyway. at least this was the
situation a few months ago.

&gt; &gt; pictures is in the book.   You can buy new rear tosion bushings (same
as a 
&gt; &gt; bay window bus) at your VW dealer- install with talcum powder.   
&gt; 
&gt; Also available via WCM
