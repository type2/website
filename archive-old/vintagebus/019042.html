Driving home from work and class this evening (8Pm) on
the west bound 202 &quot;inner-loop&quot;. Driving my newly
acquired 84 FJ60 Land Cruiser. Spotted a '68-72 white
bay bus sporting a rack with an Al Gore lock box up
front, no rear bumper and Utah plates.  Tried to catch
up to them for fun and see if I could recognize anyone
or magically know that they were a listee. Pfft! I had
a hard time catching up! I at least wanted to flash
international sign language to see if they wanted to
give me the OEM folding ladder *that they had hanging
on the Rack as they flew down the freeway!* Oh my
gosh, considered trailing them to see if it fell off.
=)
(I'm sure that it was bungeed in place)
