One question about walt's roof graft plan,

correct me if I'm wrong here, but isn't the bus that will receive the roof 
clip a westy, i.e. kombi?  If so, that would leave you with a let's see... a 
19 window bus.  It would also make welding the new roof on correctly where 
those rear windows are supposed to go kinda tricky.  In my opinion, the neat 
thing about 21/23 window busses is that VW put windows at just about every 
possible location on the bus.  That closed in window in the back would not 
look right when you were finished.  Do what you would like, of course.
