Subject: 1965 Bus Dual master Cylinder Questions

I am trying to fit a ATE 1967 Dual master cylinder into my 1965 bus (which originally came with a single MC) but am running into a problem with brakes &quot;fading&quot; when applying pressure.
The dual master cylinder has four holes in total on it. On the drivers side there are two larger diameter holes (much larger than the diameter of the brake line), on the pass side there are two smaller diameter holes which are the same diameter as the brake line. Looking at drivers side of the master cylinder the 2 larger diameter holes have &quot;check valves&quot; that screw into the larger holes and then the brakes lines into these valves. Presently the drivers front brake line and rear brake lines screw into these holes.
On the passenger side of the master cylinder the front passenger brake line is screwed directly into the one hole are the brake light switch into the other. 
It doesn't make sense that the front drivers side brake line has a check valve on the master cylinder whereas the passengers does not.
Have i screwed up the order of putting the brake lights on? Can someone shed some light on this and make my brakes happy again. Note when you apply the brakes the bus does NOT pull to one side noticeably.
 
Please pmail offline me as I am not actively reading this list- thanks in advance!
