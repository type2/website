Subject: Major Body Repairs - Rust

I am just starting a major repair and replacement of most of the underside
sheet metal.  My van was a daily driver in Michigan where the roads are
swimming in salt all winter.  As a result everything has to be replaced or
repaired.  The frame also has holes that will need to be repaired - fun job.
Everything will have to go including the cross members, I beams, and jacking
points.  

 

After looking over the job I realize that the easiest thing to do may be to
lift the whole floor from the inside and do a complete rebuild.  Is that the
way it is normally accomplished and is there anything that I should be
concerned about when I pull the floor?  Also, does that mean that I will
have to buy a replacement floor or if the flooring is mostly intact can I
reuse it? 

 

Thanks,

 

Walter
