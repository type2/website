Subject: RE: [VB] Engine Run On!

When I had my &quot;baby dells&quot; on my 1776 that I picture on my trike site I ran
into a similar problem. My fuel system was a Facet electric pump with block
off plate and a pressure regulator. I had started getting run on starting
about 150 miles and found that it was because of pressure in the fuel line
overcoming the float bowl and forcing fuel into the engine even though the
spark was missing with the key off. I bought an inline electric solenoid fuel
valve that shut the line down when power was removed. Worked like a charm
after that. I later found out that there was a better float bowl kit for the
dells but never bothered to purchase it. The engine was sold and the new owner
inherited the problem.

	I just purchased a 1776 Engine a couple of months ago and it has
been running fine. But in the last couple of tanks of gas when I turn
off the engine it wants to keep running. It has been timed and the
valves have been adjusted is it (A) Getting to Hot and need to be cooled
down with additional Air? (I have a Doghouse fan shroud and oil cooler)
(B) Bad gas and shouldn't go to Shell I have tried 87 and 89 Octane Gas
or (C) My dual baby Dells need to be Sync again? Please help if anyone
has solved this problem which I would think would have had to of
happened to at least a couple on this list at one time or another. Oh
and one other thing new wires and plugs and I have an electronic
ignition (Pertronix) with a new cap and rotor.


Thank You for your reply
