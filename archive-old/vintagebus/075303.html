Subject: Classic T-Shirts

Hi Volks,

I recently ran into a guy I used to see vending t-shirts on tour a few years
back and asked him if he had any VW Bus related designs.  He showed me the 2
designs he had and offered to sell me the whole lot at a pretty good price.
Needless to say, I am now in possession of 18pcs of the Crying Splitty and
22pcs of the VW Steal Your Face (Grateful Dead) design.  I have some on grey
shirts, and some on natural (unbleached) 100% cotton.  There are some done
with navy blue ink and some with dark maroon ink.  These shirts are all in
adult sizes Large &amp; Extra-Large.  I would like to get $10.00 ea for the
shirt + $4.00 for shipping by Priority Mail.  I think that 2 shirts could
ship for the same price as one.  If there are any left over, I should have
them with me at Transporters By The Tunnel next weekend.  Payment by paypal
to badkarma_at_ttlc_dot_net is preffered so I can get all the shirts out to their
new homes as quickly as possible.

You can check out photos of the shirts here:
