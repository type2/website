Subject: Re: [VB] VOLKSWAGEN BLUES, A KIND OF LONG LAMENT....

.........
&gt; It started 'bout three months ago
&gt; A bus bra I could use
&gt; a lady from a state
&gt; southwest of here cried
&gt; her service I should choose.
&gt; 
&gt; Just pass some cash
&gt; and the colors please
&gt; and I will do the deed
&gt; and before you know it
&gt; you will have
&gt; the bus bra that you need
&gt; 
&gt;....
 
&gt; Todays
&gt; the 30th of April
&gt; I've waited patiently
&gt; no bra, no bread
&gt; I'm wondering
&gt; are my bucks history?
......

I feel your pain!  As a vendor of a similar product(tilt Canopies) I know
the hardest part of the business is getting my product to the customer when
promised. That's the reason that I try not to take any $$$ until the product
is done so that customers won't think I am walking w/ their $$$.

You never know what's gonna affect your ability to deliver-right now I am
competing w/ the US Govmint, who walked into the factory &amp; requisitioned
every canvas tent they had in stock for the armed forces in hmmmmmm- where ?
What does that mean?

I loved the song- hang in there!
