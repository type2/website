Subject: FREE TMI Vinyl

I have some extra TMI Gray Vinyl.  Both pieces are roughly 2 ft x 3ft.  They are the light gray color TMI uses for their basket weave interiors.  (MATERIAL IS NOT BASKET WEAVE, JUST THE SAME COLOR). These are FREE.  Just pay postage.  Was going to throw them away today and thought someone might want them.

Enjoy your day!

Tom Boyd
