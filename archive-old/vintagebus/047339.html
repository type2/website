&lt;&lt; the reason your bus runs 
 better is cause cold air is denser giving you a better burn  &gt;&gt;

I always thought that the moisture in the air gave the mixture a better 
before/after ignition volumetric ratio (did that make sense?).  If you just 
got more air in there, wouldn't it just make it run lean?  Anyway, wasn't 
this the idea behind the old water injection systems?  Here in New Mexico, 
just because it rains doesn't mean it cools down!
