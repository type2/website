One of the problems you might be having is that the seals you got from WCM
could be the wrong ones, they offer 2 different thick nesses of the vent
seal, 1 is actually for the flapper diverter in your airbox and is of a
thicker rubber, when they ran out of the correct? wing vent seal they
substituted the thicker seals and they won't work without a lot of cussing.
I use a workmate to change the seals. takes abbot 10 minutes per vent wing
to change, lube it up with silicon spray, set the workmate up (they have
holes in them for different pegs (fixtures) and away you go. Also works
great on pop out windows and safari's.

Does anyone have any tips on forcing the vent window glass back into the 
frame with new WCM seals?

I have struggled for 2 days with no luck. I even lubed everything up with 
white grease and still can't get the glass back into the frames.

None of the glass shops in my redneck town will touch a Volkswagen. It is up

to me to get the things back together.

would use wd-40 rather that grease- slicker lube.  thinner than grease.    
somewhere my dad has a pic of me using a homemade device to install the
glass 
into feshly painted frames.   I was actually using bycycle inner tube rther 
than the WCM seal at the time    Did you know that the door window kits WCM 
sells for some reason includes not that seal.  the loca shops did not have 
them in stock then.     it was like a vise but it was wood, something I
think 
my dad had made for workworking purposes.    worked very well.  almost as 
good as VW tool whatever I would say.   I was using sekurit glass, I assume 
you are too- with the sigla glass you gotta be careful or youll brak it.
