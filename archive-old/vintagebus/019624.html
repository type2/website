I put the gas tank back in today.  It was MUCH easier to put back in than to
remove, which kind of surprised me.  I was wondering if someone could help me
with the fuel tank outlet.  When I took it off in the process of cleaning
the tank, there was no gasket material in there.  There was lots of crap built
up on it...but I don't think any of it was a gasket.  

When I put the thing back on this afternoon, I decided I didn't trust a
metal-metal seal to keep my gas from leaking, although the lower part (the 
threaded cap with the hole) seems to be aluminum, and the tube/disc thing
is steel, so I guess the softer metal would deform to make a seal.  Anyway, 
I cut a gasket from a sheet of material I had, and I was wondering if this is
a good idea or not.  No gas in it yet, so I can still easily undo it :-)
