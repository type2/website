Subject: Re: [VB] What's in your garage?

In my garage, which is about three feet wider than my bus, I've got my '65 bus,
Mig welder w/BIG tank, HVLP sprayer, extra doors, trunk lid, tire, windows,
paint, and most of the time, ME, moving around like I'm in a poorly-lit crawl
space under a house bringing my bus back from the dead!  (I hope the parts I had
cut for me came off buses in worse shape)  But where I live garages are scarce,
and I'm lucky to have what I do!

&gt; It's finally friday and I'd like to pursue the topic I proposed a couple of
&gt; days ago.
&gt; Namely &quot;What's in your garage?&quot; Based on my own experience, I realized long
&gt; ago that my garage will probably never hold my &quot;daily driver&quot;. In my garage
&gt; now resides the following:
&gt; A 1961 ragtop beetle &quot;off the pan&quot; on the right side, with the beetle pan on
&gt; the left side.
&gt; Piled on top of that, two aftermarket floor pans, two complete sets of
&gt; engine tin for a 1500, three 6V starters, and various other engine parts.
&gt; Between the beetle and it's pan sit an air compressor, oxy-acatelyne welding
&gt; set up and a mig welder.
&gt; To round out the clutter, there's various lawn chairs, a dog cage, gas cans
&gt; and at least three trash bags full of crushed beer cans waiting to be cashed
&gt; in.
&gt; In the driveway, sits my '66 Westy along with a '64 beetle convertible
&gt; (non-runner) and an '81 rabbit convertible (son's daily driver).
&gt; My wife's has long ago given up the idea of parking anywhere but on the
&gt; street.
