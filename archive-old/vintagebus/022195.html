&gt;Bottom line:  The long-block ALONE cost $7,000.00!!!  This was a nearly 
&gt;complete engine, lacking just the alternator and AC pump.  Out the door with 

One time I was at the local Porsche shop, picking up some parts, when a guy
who just bought a 911, *cheap* because it had a toasted motor, came in.  He
was a VW guy, and asked about what it would cost to get a rebuild.  The
shop manager went down the litany of things involved in a rebuild, and the
guy nodded and said &quot;sounds good, what does it cost?&quot;  &quot;Anywhere from 8 to
12 thousand.&quot; was the answer.  I swear the guy just about pooped his pants
right there.

For example, a set of pistons and cylinders for my bus are ~$90.  For the
911 it's 2100, and that doesn't include *rings*

Granted, this may be the extreme, but it sure puts things into perspective.
 For what it would cost to do the engine on the 911, I could intercept a
really nice deluxe on it's way to japan...
