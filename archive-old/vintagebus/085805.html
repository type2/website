&gt; What does everyone use on the valve cover side of the gasket. anything at all?
&gt; I was putting my covers back so I can go back in, and was wondering if anyone
&gt; used anything.  It didn't leak before, never been on the road yet, at least
&gt; from the valve covers.


I use hylomar on the valve cover side of the gasket.  Sticky to hold the
gasket in place, but doesn't harden and wipes right off when changing
gaskets.

On th head side I use nothing at all.  I make sure that the head surface
is clean and wiped free
of oil.
