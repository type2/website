They make a stepped stud for just this situation.  NAPA has 'em.  You'll also
need the proper sized tap (10mm x 1.25?) and a whole lot of patience.  Pull
the muffler and pipe, open the hole, tap it, insert the stud and put it all
back together.

&gt; Hey, I noted a exhaust leak between #2cylinder and head and just checked the
&gt; bolt torque.  Results:none, I thought it must have really loosened up, but
&gt; after 2 turns I started to wonder and sure enough the stud was coming out of
&gt; the case.  Any ideas what to do?  This is my only way to work, and I'll
&gt; gladly buy a stock engine if I need to to buy some time to get this one
&gt; fixed.  Anyone in WA got one for sale?  A long block would even do just
&gt; fine.  I doubt I could find a business open on the fourth to supply a part
&gt; that day.  Thanks for the help and Happy driving--Chet
