Subject: M Code and Decklid

Hello List,

    I have been inactive for a while but recently
picked up a 59 Crew and was hoping for a little help
on the Mcode...

04 05 9

361 UP 265 RED

466098

I know it was made in 04 May 1959 and exported to
Portland, Oregon. 265 = Double Cab, cab door on right,
left side drive. And it is supposed to have grey
intereior. 466098 is the chassis number. I can't
figure out the exterior color, I am figuring Sealing
wax red or ruby red, and what 361 is. 

Also if anyone has a good decklid contact me offlist.
Thanks in advance.

Greg
