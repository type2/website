&gt; I'm concerned about the dual valve spring situation.  Had I known that I
&gt; should have removed them, I would have done it while the heads were
sitting
&gt; here in the box.  I didn't know that you can flatten a new cam (and
actually
&gt; I have a stock reground 110) with the dual springs.

There has been talk in recent months of some cams going flat in a few
hundred miles with stock springs and if your cam is going to do that, the
dual springs aren't going to matter. I would not be that concerned about it
happening that you should forego your trip, I would just put it in your top
ten of things to do when you get home. Run just the outer springs, or get
some new ones, whatever. The stockers are adequate for any speeds a daily
driver bus engine should see, but mildly heavier are all right. The only
reason to have duals is to keep from floating the valves at very high rpm's.
If you don't drive like that, and you shouldn't, get rid of them.
