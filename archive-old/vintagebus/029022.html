&gt; I have been listening to all the talk the last couple days about cooling

&gt; snows only because the Chicago salt wreaks havoc on floorpans and such.

What kind of enjoyment can you get out of your bus driving it two days a year???

Well yesterday we drove 600 miles across the Utah and Nevada deserts in record
breaking well over 100 deg heat.  The breeze was great for the passenger
sleeping in the back bed with all of the louvered windows open.  The driver used
wet rags to cool down the body when the sun was shining in the front.  The
advantages of dry heat.

The operating temps generally stayed about 230-235, we got up to 240 on a couple
up hill runs so we slowed her down to 20 mph and crwaled up with no problems.
At the top of the hills we passed the new SUVs that had gone flying past us up
the hill, sitting there with their hoods up waiting to cool off.

We are in Tahoe where the bus will get her oil changed and the valves checked.
She ran like a trooper (not $ss$z$ ) and brought us in.

Anyone else in Reno for Hot August Nights?  We plan to be swapping the next
three days.
