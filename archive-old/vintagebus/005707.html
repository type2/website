I've mentioned these before, but it's been a while...

FRAM makes a marine fuel filter that's just about bullet-proof.  It looks
like a ~1/2 size version of an old style cartridge oil filter housing, and
works about the same.  The &quot;cup&quot; is steel [no glass allowed in a marine
engine room], and it uses an inexpensive filter cartridge.  Whether by
design or happy accident I don't know, but these are quite effective at
separating water from the fuel.  There's a drain plug in the bottom, and
some folks replace it with a small petcock valve for convenience.  It's
amazing how much water there is in regular leaded &amp; unleaded gasoline.

I'd been running assorted inline filters on the V-8 in our old boat and was
fed up with clogged filters due to lousy quality fuel from remote and little
used gas pumps/tanks.  A commercial fisherman friend put me on to the FRAM
unit and I never had a plugged filter again.  As I recall the filter
assembly cost around $15.00 in the late '80s, and the replacement filter
cartridges were ~$1.50.  I bought mine from a commercial marine engine
outfit in Tacoma WA.

I don't have access to my records just now, and won't until next week.  I'll
do some digging and post a follow-up with part numbers, etc., as soon as I
can get to it.

FWIW.....

&gt;&gt;  Better to use a larger filter mounted under the bus.  Less danger and
better filtering.  You can even get spin-on gas filters if you're so
inclined.

George, who wonders if I could find one of those nice sediment bowls with a
drain like my dad had on his 'ol tractor?  &lt;&lt;
