Should I force these things together?  How about bending the tube on the 
muffler?  Any thoughts or warnings?
Hi Greg,
That is a standard part of the muffler that you just have to pry/clamp/bend 
into place to the point you can easily hand screw in the bolts in that area.  
If you have the correct size tap it is a good idea to clean out the threads 
there first.
