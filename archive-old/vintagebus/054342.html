Hi Ed,
Use a combo of differant rust removing tools one at a time of wire wheel, 
sand paper and Naval Jelly (An acidic rust remover availible at any hardware 
store.).  The last item works really well in cool weather 70F and lower to 
just above freezing, with a layer of plastic wrap laid over it to prevent 
drying out overnight.  This will remove the least amount of metal.  Then all 
you need to do is go out and buy a wire feed MIG/TIG gas welder to do this 
repair and even more later to your VWs and other metal projects.   Eric&amp;Barb
