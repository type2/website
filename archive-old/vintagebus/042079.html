&gt; I have a question.  If all of us on the VintageBus listserv and type2 list
&gt; took a vote and decided we did want the archives published (even though we
&gt; know what the &quot;agreement&quot; was when we signed up), would that make any
&gt; difference?

No.  All it takes is one person who doesn't want their work sold to nix
the deal.  You would have to get every person whose message appears in
the archives to agree in writing to have it republished, including a lot
of folks who aren't with us anymore.

Not possible, IMO.
