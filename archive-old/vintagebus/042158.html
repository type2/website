&gt;  *tight* in place, take a blow torch to the rivet 'til the rivet is cherry 
&gt; red, then whack it a good one with the GBH.  &gt;&gt;
&gt;   
&gt; Heating the rivet before installing it in the rim will work, but heating it 
&gt; it while it is in the rim might change the hardness of the steel of the rim 


I have this image of someone heating up rivets and tossing them to the
catcher. He catches it in his metal cup rams it into the hub and you give
it a whack with the Ball Peen.
So how many people does it take to install a hubcap clip?
