Subject: Re: [VB] cyclone filter or not?

&gt;    I think I have some pics of Roger Nang's cyclone filter, and of 
&gt;one in a nice Riviera.   very similar to the Thing filters, and I am 
&gt;not sur eteh difference, but evidently there is one.   Looks like a 
&gt;sort of eggish cylinder strapped to the right of the engine 
&gt;compartment.
&gt;
&gt;pmail me if you want the pics I have

that'd be great... i think you sent me the riveria one (is it green? 
- and it's actually from vintagebus, NOT thesamba?)... that is the 
filter i bought. like i said, the bentley shows a much bigger 
filter/hose. but possibly they changed to a cheaper model...


&gt;it's a heavy duty oil bath air filter.   the air  * actually 
&gt;cyclones*  through it.
&gt;

well, the middle part is full of coir, so it'd be hard for the air to 
cyclone in there. it really is just a bigger oil bath filter, with a 
larger capacity to trap dirt in the coir than the standard models.
for the record, cyclone filters on, say, tractors have a large 
chamber with vanes, etc that really DO cause the air to rotate at 
high speed, flinging the dust out of the airstream. the air then goes 
through the standard filter element.
