Subject: Re:  [VB] Brake Fluid Reservior
To: shunt13_at_webtv_dot_net, vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com


Hello all, Hey I gota a quick question. My res is leaking right above
the screw that goes into the brake cyl. I put some RTV all  around it in
hopes this woud fix the problem of leakage. Anyy reason why this won't
work? It's emty now and I cleaned it real good before I slapped the RTV
on. I know the res. is a cheap part but I've got     to order it and get
it shpped to me. We don't have any places around here to get a reservior
for a 60.  AWWWW the joy of living in the sticks.....TIA

I dunno.  mine does too.  Oozes.  You know, there is supposed to be a squash 
ring between the res and the MC.   I took my res off and cleaned and 
reinstalled with new ring and it still oozes.  Anyway, it is damp with brake 
fluid.  maybe my res is bad   i didn't see anycracks in the res though. 
However, mine is not dripping.  I do occasionally look at it and the fluid 
level has not dropped.    Maybe it was a bad cap?   splash splash.  dunno.
