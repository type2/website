Subject: FREE WESTY-GONE!!

Well Volks, the free westy that Ronnie was posting last week is now in my =
next door neighbors yard ready for resto-time.  So far we have found out =
it is a 1970 Westfalia, almost no rust at all anywhere, totally intact =
interior, original paint, all it needs is a motor and tranny and a couple =
pieces of glass and it's going down the road.....a complete Westfalia!! To =
ALL of those who picked and kicked around with Ronnie trying to get parts =
off of it, or just finding out whatever it had/didn't have,--TOO BAD!! =
This bus has everything and was well-worth the offer of FREE!! you shoulda =
came and got it! :-)   We had the opportunity to check out Ronnie's =
Garage, that guy has more bus (and bug) parts, tools, manuals and stuff =
than anyone I have ever met! And a lot/most of it is vintage stuff! He has =
a really cool old Snap-on exhaust analyzer, a valve/head machine, and just =
cool old buses and bus parts and a cool old doublecab he's been working on =
for a long time. Really awesome Ronnie, I would just &quot;hate&quot; to see your =
other stashes you were telling us about! :)  Another good thing about the =
westy bus we got from Ronnie is that is a &quot;clear&quot; vehicle in the AZ Motor =
Vehicle Division records and with the local Maricopa County Sherriff's =
office as we got pulled over the night we brought the bus home, I guess if =
a vehicle is being transported by another, even on a trailer, they have =
full right to inspect the vehicle, registered or not, to see if it is a =
stolen vehicle! So with a broken back window and a mangled license plate =
the cops had good reason to pull us over I guess. But other than that had =
a good trip back to Phoenix. We'll keep the list informed (type2list, that =
is) on the progress of the 'ol bus next door. Otherwise, Tiffany and =
myself will see you guys at the Classic!! Laters- Mark &amp; Tiffany B. 1960 =
EZ Camper &amp; 1960 Beetle
