&gt; &gt;If my memory of high school and college physics serves me right, the color

&gt; Sorry Richard but a blackbody is an object that emits as much thermal
&gt; radiation as possible. It is not referring to the objects color. See the
&gt; definition  at

Well, they don't call it a &quot;blackbody&quot; for nothing!

For objects that are hotter than their environment, a black color does
indeed radiate more heat than a lighter shade.

&gt; All of this discussion on colors absorbing and reflecting heat make me
&gt; chuckle. It seems to me everyone is mixing conductive heat transfer with
&gt; radiation heat transfer with absorbtion of heat from light sources.

Most heat from a VW engine is transferred by forced convection, but
a significant amount is radiated.  You won't fix an overheating problem by
painting the engine black but it is probably worth a degree or two.

Absorbtion of heat from a light source is the opposite of radiative heat
transfer.  The only difference is that the radiation being emitted is in
the IR frequency range rather than the visible range.
