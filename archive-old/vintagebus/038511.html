OK, Picture this....a junk yard that has not seen anything but scavengers
and onlookers for 4 to 5 years.  It's not your typical junk yard with stacks
of bodys with a oily dirt trail between the stacks.  These are bodys that
were stacked or placed at random starting from the back of the yard
forward.  It's kind of a history story like the bands of a tree trunk.  Time
does move forward.  It's kind of a maze of cars, trucks, and heavy
contuction equipment including a railroad track and tie layer.  Most of this
stuff is now covered with weeds and berry vines in such a way that it's art
in its self.  I climbed over one truck to take a look at another that in the
distance looked at ground level but when I got there I found two more truck
underneath it.  Someone could have been living down there.  Actually there
could have been a whole community down there.  BTW I got some great B&amp;W's,
sort of a Iron &amp; organic nature study.  The guy that owns the place is
almost ninty and up until a few years ago carried a 38mm pistol in his loose
pants pocket.  Tom and I made him what we felt was a good offer but he was
still holding on to a offer he had gotten several years ago when most of the
stuff was on it.  He says he can move it for us but taking into account that
we had to help him move around the yard we have our doubts.  We do plan to
go back in a couple of weeks and work on him and there's some stuff I want
to get for Louise.  I think it will be a study in how to get it and maybe
another bus out.  Stay tuned for more of the exciting adventures of Thom and
John, Bus Hunters in the Wild.

If it's worth doing, it's worth doing
yourself.
