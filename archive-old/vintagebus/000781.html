&lt;&lt; hi...
 
    I have a question about my '64 singlecab doors..what doors are 
 correct?the doors that came on the bus when I got it have push 
 button handles and those catch latches from the door to jam(to 
 hold the doors open)problem is there are no mounts on the body 
 side for them...should it have '63 style pull out doors? or did they 
 make doors with push button handles and no catch 
 latches??should I just weld up the holes on the doors and call it 
 good?or what?   I'm in the restoration process but I'm not a 
 perfectionist.  this thing is going to get used and is being built with 
 drivability in mind...everything mechanically has been rebuilt 
 shifting,trans converted to IRS(late model 
 bug)steering,1600sp,brakes(stock front, '65 type3 
 rear)spindles.....slightly lowered(I could'nt help myself..no self 
 control)everything body and interior wize is stock

The switch from pull handle to push button type doors was part way through 
the 64 model year.

It was at CH # 1 222 026 Dec 18 1963.

the later doors have the stay open thing, the earlier ones don't

At the same time of the door change the engine stay changed form the elbow 
type to the spring type.
