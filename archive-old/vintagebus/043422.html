&gt;FWIW...  Many of the commercial electrical suppliers make a latching
&gt;relay.  I have used them in the past on industrial equipment.

Do you know if any of these are the single-coil, same polarity
for latch and unlatch style?  This is what you need for a VW.
The few Magnecraft latching relays I find listed in a Mouser
electronics catalog (admittedly not an electrical wholesaler
like you mentioned) either have two coils (one latch and one
unlatch) or one coil that latches in one polarity and unlatches
in another.  You might be able to use some of the relay contacts
to switch the coil, but if the mechanical timing isn't exactly
right I think it would be real easy to make a buzzer instead
of a relay.  :)

Also, these relays seem to be rated for switching AC...they probably 
can switch DC but their DC rating is probably lower than their
AC rating.  You'd need about a 16 amp DC rating for 6v headlights
and an 8 amp for 12v.

The Mouser catalog lists the latching relays for $22.51 each
and the socket for $2.24...if you have a 12v system this isn't
much gain over the $25-$30 OEM-style relay from various VW vendors.
If you can get the &quot;industrial&quot; part cheaper than this would
change the equation.

&gt;Heck, Radio Shack might even have 'em.  They're just not that rare.

When our Buses were new, Radio Shack stocked useful and interesting 
parts like latching relays.  Now, Radio Shack would much rather
sell TV sets and cell phones and computers.  They still do have
a small parts selection, which works OK if you know exactly what
part you want.  If you don't, don't expect anyone in the store to be
able to help you.  They might tell you that they can get it on
special order, but if it's reached that point, you can probably
order it yourself and get it in the same amount of time, 
but cheaper.  :) 

IMHO.
