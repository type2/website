The flashers have been out on my 67 kombi for the
last 2 weeks.  I broke out my stash of 9 used
boxes and tried each one.  Go figure that I saved
them for the last 10 years for nothing!

The last chance was to install an NOS one I have
been saving for 15 years.  Woo Hoo, it worked! 
Unfortunately, one more NOS part disappeared from
the face of the earth, but at least the bus is
legal again.
