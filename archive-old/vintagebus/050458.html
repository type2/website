I think this is a pretty good one-stop comparison of Westy models, with
pictures:  http://www.geocities_dot_com/MotorCity/Flats/3677/page21.html

Is this what you had in mind?  Perhaps the Type 2 Library might add a
direct link to it in the Camper section.

&gt; put on a link so we can see what the various configurations look like?.
&gt; I'm sure I've seen a lot of Westy type units but it certainly is
&gt; confusing. I know some are very rare and  I see many list members with
&gt; nonstandard conversions that were special ordered or modified.
&gt; A picture gallery of side mount accessory tents would also be nice.
&gt; A home page link could accomplish this task nicely and serve to educate
&gt; us type confused list members.
