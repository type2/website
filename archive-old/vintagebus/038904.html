We recently checked a doghouse oil cooler by removing it and placing it in
the parts washer, hooked up with tubing into the opening, and watched the
output until she was clean. The could be done to check for blockage,flow
should be low.

&lt;&lt; &gt;&gt; Did you oil the 009 distributor under the rotor?&lt;&lt;  No . Where exactly
do you oil the thing?&gt;&gt;

Hi Ric,
Remove rotor and drip one or two drops of engine oil onto the felt wick that
is seated in the round hole under the rotor.  This oils the wieghts and
keeps
them from rusting/sticking and allows the distributor to advance in most
non-vaccume distributors and some vaccume distributors!

 &lt; Are you using a 2:1 ratio lower pulley and a 33, 34, or better yet 35mm
inside measurement cooling fan?&lt;&lt; I have no idea. How do you measure these
things. I *think* everything is stock 1971 stuff.&gt;&gt;

Find and move to TDC on your lower pulley.  Paint a mark on the upper pulley
where you can align it to some part of the engine.  Turn lower pulley once
and upper pulley should turn exactly twice.  If lower pulley turns less than
twice, it is not a 2:1 pulley and will cause over heating in doghouse
engines.  If it turns more than twice you probably have a 2;1 pulley and
have
used the smaller 905 fan belt and shimed the heck out of the upper pulley
like we do on our buses!  As for the fan, measure between the discs of the
fan with a caliper or tape measure.

 &gt; &gt; Check your oil pressure relief spring not only for being switched in a
 DR,&gt;&gt;   Sorry to be stupid, what is &quot;DR&quot; &gt;&gt;

Never stupid to ask a question, mayhaps funny 'cause we have done the same
once upon a time!  DR means Dual Relief, because it has two spring loaded
oil
pressure relief valves built into the case.

&lt;&lt;  What CR are you running?&gt;&gt;   I have no idea. &lt;&lt;

That could be causing you alot of the over heating problem!

 &lt;&lt;What RPM for highway cruising are you using?&gt;&gt;   I have no tach in this
beast,
 and I regret that. WIll put one in.&gt;&gt;

All you really need to do is wire one in for a fifteen minute drive and have
a friend hold the gauge and write down the MPH at 1,500 and 3,000 RPM in
each
forward gear.  Just make sure to RPM the engine at each of these RPM/MPH
spots in each gear for more than a couple of seconds to avoid the tach
needle
swing delay!  You never want to go below 1,500 RPM except for first and
reverse ( In our panel conversion with 3.875 R&amp;P fourth gear seems to lug
the
engine below 2,000 RPM!), and even in those gears you want to get above
1,500
RPM ASAP safely without drag racing it.  2,500-2,800 RPM seems to be the
best
RPM range for cooling the engine.  On the other hand if you find yourself on
a really loooooooooong steep hill and/or heavy payload going up a
loooooooong
hill and can not get the RPM up above 2,000 RPM in 2nd, 3rd, or especially
4th gear it is best to just downshift and and get the engine  into the 2,500
to 3,000 RPM range and thusly cooling fan speed up.

 &gt;&gt;You just might want to change oil coolers.  Some used oil coolers that
were not used with a full flow filter setup have been known to have passages
in the cooler to be clogged up allowing the hot oil less surface area to be
cooled! &lt;&lt;  Is there any way to check this? &lt;&lt;

Yes there are two ways!
1.  Replace cooler and if the oil suddenly runs markedly cooler, the old oil
cooler had blockage.
 2.  Cut your cooler in half lengthwise and look for blockage.

 &gt;&gt;The 68 bus used a 30 amp generator, the 69 to 71 used a 38 amp generator
that was longer and required completely differant fan to shroud tin.&lt;&lt;  I
figured that one out on my own! How much of a job is it to replace while in
the bus?  &lt;&lt;

PITA, for us it is easier to remove the engine and do maintance/inspection
of
various part of the engine, and clutch.  Remember you need to keep the rear
of the cooling fan shimmed to keep .080&quot; (4mm) from the generator to fan
shroud tin or suffer cooling difficulties.

&lt;&lt;THanks for all the input! &gt;&gt;

You are welcome!  Make sure you have all the engine to body seals and even
the engine lid to body seal.  Plus all the proper engine tin in place.
Running an engine with just the forward engine tin piece missing will cause
the engine oil temp to run 20F higher!
