Subject: Re: [VB] dizzy shaft shim in case   :P

vwbus_at_ckoon_dot_org writes:    &lt;&lt; well, while pranking with fuel pump pressure, 
etc i was pulling the dizzy
 shaft in order to remove a shim. NATURALLY i dropped one (ok, TWO) in 
there!!!!
 this is bad cuz
 a) these shims are getting hard to find and
 b) there are shims in the case!!! :P &gt;&gt;

Also bad because they are in the area of the case with the large cam gear and 
can easily get sucked up in between the two gears!  Remove oil pump and fish 
them out now or enjoy an engine rebuild soon.  Eric&amp;Barb
