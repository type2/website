Noticed a little oil drip on left side.  Ya, it turns out to look a lot like 
oil cooler.
Hi DDixon,
Pull the engine this weekend and fix it!  That is the sort of leak that can 
easily get really bad all too fast.  We once picked up a low mileage Kombi with 
SO-33 interior that had been run dry and destroyed the engine due to such a 
leak.
