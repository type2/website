&lt;&lt; I thought that when the busses were painted brown above the beltline, the
 bus was completely painted the below color (usually red) including the
 dash, inside doors, etc.  When they switched to light colors on top, then
 they switched to painting everything white first, then painting the body
 color below.   &gt;&gt;

While sanding down and blasting my 66 21 window (white/blue) it has blue 
under the white.  Hmm. Interesting.

They didnt switch the painting process with the light on top scheme.  In fact 
I see a bazillion busses with the lower color bleeding thru on top.

Who knows, maybe Hans liked red one day more than white and vice versa.
