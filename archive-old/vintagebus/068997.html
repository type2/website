Subject: Removing tie rods using Autozone loaned tools

My passenger side tie rod ends in the 65 were toast, and were stuck on  
terribly, so I went down to autozone(chain)  And used their loan  
program to borrow a tie rod end puller, pitman arm puller, and tie rod  
separator.  Neither puller fit right, I was able to get some pressure  
on the bolt but couldn't get it to pop, so I resorted to the separator  
- large pickle fork/wedge and with a couple of careful blows, both ends  
dropped off in seconds.  They charged $20 for each puller, and 15 for  
the fork on my credit card, and credited me fully when I brought the  
tools back a couple hours later.  IMHO this program works absolutely  
great for me, as someone who is learning how to do more than just  
general maintenance on their vehicles.  They have alot of great tools  
available  Here's the site in case there's one in your area.
