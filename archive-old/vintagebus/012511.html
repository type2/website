Subject: 78 Westy For Sale

Fellow listees,

I'm selling my 1978 Westy Deluxe.  It's tan with the green plaid interior.
I bought it last year with low compression, beat up interior, wobbly
wheel bearings, and no heat.  Since then all of the above have been fixed,
the camper interior is 100% complete and the engine runs great - 70mph on
the highway, really.  Coming from California, there is minimal rust, with the
exception around the front windshield. The only things that don't work are
the fuel gauge and the refrigerator and it has two tears in the pop-top.

I'm in the Los Angeles area and am asking $4000.

Pmail me or call 310-456-8954.

Thanks,

Rich Muller
