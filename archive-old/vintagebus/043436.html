&gt;Any suggestions on what or how to wire the &quot;hot' for a stereo installation
&gt;in a split bus.  [...] 67 Westy

Wire it to the far right fuse in the fuse box -- the red 16A fuse on the
end.  Use the end that still has power when the fuse is removed.  In
other words, get a test light or voltmeter, ground one lead of the
light/meter, pull out the fuse, and try the other lead of the light/meter
to both fuse block terminals, and use the one that has power (light on).
It *should* be the terminal with two fat red wires attached, but the
test light will tell you for sure.

There should be an extra tab connector (push-on) on the fuse block,
on the back side of the terminal you found above, that you can use.
Just put a push-on socket connector on your stereo's power wire.

Your stereo should have an inline fuse in its power wire - a plastic
holder with a fuse in it.  Try to get the fuse as close as you can
to the original VW fuse box.  In other words, don't come off the
VW fuse box with three feet of wire before you get to the inline
fuse for the stereo.  Leave a few inches of wire, so you can easily
disconnect it, though.  The reason is that you are tapping the main,
unfused wire from the battery, and if the hot wire to your stereo
grounds out, you will have much excitement.  A secondary reason
is that this keeps all the fuses in one spot for future maintenance.  

As Steve (Volken67_at_aol_dot_com) mentioned, you shouldn't try to run
a killer stereo like this.  However, the Ambulance models ran
at least another 85 watts or so (7 amps) off this wire, so most
stereos should do fine.  If the inline fuse to your stereo is
more than about 7 amps, though, you may want to think about
wiring it differently.

Don't forget to hook up the ground wire of your stereo.  The screws
that hold the parcel shelf to the nose work well -- crimp a ring or
spade terminal on the ground wire first.
 
Good luck!
