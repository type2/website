Subject: interior panels wanted
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

Hey there,
I'm looking for a complete (or as complete as I can find)set of interior 
panels for the cargo area of a bus...
I would prefer the silver beige /basalt grey combo or mesh grey, but will 
consider all!!!! I've got parts to trade and cash as well...
Thanks,
Pete
