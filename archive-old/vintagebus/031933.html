&lt;&lt;  The tranny in the '56 is fairly good;
 it's a rebuild by carters, although it's still a bit sticky getting thru
 the gears.  Right now it has StaLube 85/140 in it.  &gt;&gt;
Hi thom,
The reason for your tranny being sticky is that you are using too high a
wieght of oil.  Which at higher temperatures the heavier oil has troubles
getting into the high tolerance areas.  It would be interesting to see what
85/90 or 80/90WT Sta-lube would do.    Eric &amp; Barb
