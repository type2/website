&gt; Yep, it was a great experience....the most notable bits were the meeting of

&gt; I've been playing with for the past 9 months.
&gt; 
&gt; The only &quot;trouble&quot; was a generator light that flashed on for a few seconds
&gt; after finally making it through the traffic Friday eve.  The light came on,
&gt; I switched off ignition, and on flashers as I coasted to a stop...before I
&gt; stopped, two busses were pulling in behind me on 101...Roger and Clara to
&gt; the rescue! Cool! So I checked everything, started back up, and red light
&gt; didn't come back.

Check your generator brushes.  Intermittant light is a symptom that might
be caused by worn brushes.  The top of the carbon brush should stand above
the metal holder.  If it's not, replace!  Remember, there are two brushes,
one easy to get at on top, one a bit tougher underneath!
