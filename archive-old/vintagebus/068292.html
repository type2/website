Subject: re: tents

&gt; From: Rick Taylor &lt;busbarn_at_Prodigy_dot_net&gt;
&gt; Unless you are going for that &quot;vintage original&quot; look, a new tent is
&gt; cheaper, faster and easier to use and not in need of repair.

I have to agree with Rick, even though I've had the tent website up for
sometime and love to drool over them at shows.  I've enjoyed camping with
my driveaway and will continue to use the foyer &quot;tent&quot; on the splitty, but
I'm less and less inclined to set up the big tent for anything less than
expedition-style 4+night trips to the Serengeti to bag elephants, what? 
Newer tents are just too much better.  I'm probably going to sell my
driveaway tent when I get rid of the 71 westy in a few months.  Gack, I
can't believe I said that.  But it has some rips and a couple of bad
zippers, and it's heavy, and fragile, and &lt;whine&gt;. 

But you couldn't have told me that before I got a chance to BE in one on a
campout with the breeze billowing real canvas around me at night.  Who
knew a tent could smell like a Volkswagen?  OK, maybe I'll keep it.
