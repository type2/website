Eric,
I live in San Diego and while we have more rain than arid-zona, we have many
months of dry. What I have done is install the &quot;lay down&quot; wiper assembly used
for Safari windows. This places both wipers into a holder at the bottom of the
center post of the split windows (the holder is called a one eye duck). We
like this because it gets the wiper out of your face when you don't need it.
When you need it, you stop the bus and lift the wiper out of the holder and
move it over to the active position. There is a little more slop in the system
than with a good condition stock system, but for as little as I need them it
is fine. The shaft parts as well as the one eye duck I think can be had from
West Coast Metric as well as Wolfsburg West both in the LA area. Both have web
pages easily found with any browser. Their phone people are VERY HELPFUL. Good
luck
