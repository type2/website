Okay, those of you that have been around in the VW industry a while
might know this one.

The EMPI name went through this exact same situation a few years back. 
Lyle Cherry owned the name, but Mr. Bug started to use it.  When Lyle
sued, Mr. Bug won only because Lyle couldn't afford to keep fighting
them.  He even tried to make the name public, but failed to do so.  Now
Mr. Bug protects the name EMPI.  

So, if anyone wants to banish VW for their practices, that's fine.  But
any of you that do, you better not have a single EMPI part on your car
that was made after 1974!!!

&gt; &gt; The issue is trade mark law - not vw.  The fact is if you don't
&gt; &gt; protect your trade mark you lose it.  If vw isn't diligent in protecting
&gt; its
&gt; &gt; trademark it will become part of the public domain and anyone will be able
&gt; to use it.
&gt; &gt; Your problem is with the law of intellectual property your efforts will be
&gt; &gt; better spent complaining to law makers.
&gt; 
&gt; This is true.  By federal law, if you don't protect your trademark you lose
&gt; it, so your issue is really with the legislature, not VW.
&gt; In my recent foray into Fiat land (having traded a used Bus engine for a '76
&gt; Spider convertible - boy is that car fun to drive!), I learned that VW is
&gt; not alone in their diligence.  Recently Fiat forced a parts specialist in
&gt; the U.S. to remove the word &quot;Fiat&quot; from their business name on the grounds
&gt; of trademark infringement - this despite the fact that Fiat pulled out of
&gt; the U.S. market for 17 years ago!!  I suppose they want to keep that
&gt; trademark safe just in case there is a sudden groundswell of demand in the
&gt; U.S. for notoriously unreliable Italain motor vehicles. :-)
