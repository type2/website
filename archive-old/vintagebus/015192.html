was writ: &quot;after looking at those pics i can almost make out a &quot;flip top&quot; 
westfalia hatch roof.&quot;

i was thinking the same thing but according to the year thought i was seeing 
things:) but you know, if they found a stash of hatch's layin around in 
hanover they probably decided to cut 'em in. i'd like to see what kind of 
interior is in that thing. maybe some kind of hybrid flip-seat SO-42.
later,
