&lt;&lt;  There are 
 four splits in my town and I notice that the 63 23 window has the 
 same problem.....Its gotta be a common problem.   Has anyone 
 sucessfully repaired a torn out hinge?   Obviously its a weld job,  
 but not sure what and where to weld to. &gt;&gt;
Hi Jeff,
Just weld the torn metal back to the metal it was torn from and then dremel
the left over welding material away so the hinge fits.  Eric &amp; Barb
