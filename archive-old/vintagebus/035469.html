&lt;&lt; Not necessarily true, the 66 deluxe (church bus) untouched all original 
bus came with only 1 round mirror on the drivers side, mirrors were an option 
and basically it was what ever the dealer installed. I think that it 1965 in 
became a federal law that all vehicles must have an outside rear view mirror.

Hi Volks,
We have a collection of &quot;Circular Letters&quot; from VOA to thier dealerships from 
about late 54 to late 58.  One of these from about 1958 informs the 
dealerships that they must inspect the VWs at the dock and make sure all of 
the parts for installation by the dealership in a box inside of each VW must 
be checked before signing off on the shippment of VWs.  Among the listed 
parts is the exterior mirror head for the buses.

PS  Does anyone else have these or later letters?  Would like to compare info 
with you if you do.  EEE&amp;B
