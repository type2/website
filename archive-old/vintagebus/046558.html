&lt;&lt; I figure I should buy one, since there's about 12 in every single booth at

Hi Jason,
OK.  The electrical socket with lighter for American automobiles are about 
twice the diameter than the Euro ones.  The early part of 1960s Westies had 
this Euro socket in the right rear closet above the door with a chromy flip 
cover for plugging in the Westie hanging lamp.  Also if you look under the 
dash package tray in any 55 to 67 about two inches to either side of the 
heater tube there are two factory holes for the Euro sockets for ambulance 
installation!  This smaller socket size is still used in todays Euro auto 
market.  
  So if you are asking about the American version plug/socket you can pick 
these up at any FLAPS and just unscrew the knob off the plug and most times 
be able to thread a normal VW dash knob right on.  This kit usually comes 
with a L-shaped mounting bracket which is handy for mounting the socket in 
many places under the dash so you do not need to cut the VW body.  Mounting 
under the light switch using the light switch mounting screw to also mount 
the socket bracket at the same time, or mount the socket under the speedo pod 
by one of the steering column bracket bolts is just two of many options.
