&gt;Jp and list,
&gt;Barry called me to tell me all about the fun week end at the Classic. He
also 
&gt;said that Cletus had his TV bus set up to run down the high way at 85 mph
all 
&gt;day long. Do you know if he has a web page on the TV bus? Or do you know the 
&gt;mods to it?

Yeah, that bus does rock!  I'm a sucker for logo'd buses and made sure to
get some good pictures of this one!  And the Speedwell bus...but I can't
believe those logos were done recently.  Greg, you gotta get him to come up
to SJ sometime!
