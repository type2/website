Subject: Re: [VB] bolt specs

The online parts manual http://wow.atlasta_dot_net/~mriluvu/oacdp/5867part.html
(a good source for questions like yours) lists this stud as a 10 A x 85. It
does list an oversize but I don't know if its available.

  I have a motor im working on (the stock sp for the 67 delux) that has
apparently the bottom two (mounting) bolts (you know the two poking out you
use to put the motor in) that are apparently damaged. I got new studs, they
dont really go in right or take any tourque (whichi is probably why they
were missing, yeesh). Are these 8mx1.0 pitch holes (in helicoil or timesert
terms)?. Which is better for this application. (i want to drill both out and
redo them). I found a timesert kit that has 8x1 thats only 11mm long tho, i
think this is the only thing offered (nothing longer). is there a step stud
available for this? I dont have a quality tap and die set, id like to either
buy the time sert or helicoil kit and have what I need to do it. thanks
