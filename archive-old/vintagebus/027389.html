Subject: Re: [VB] What size compressor for blasting?
References: &lt;3.0.5.32.20000404213222.007b3cf0_at_mail.type2guy_dot_com&gt;

I've done quite a bit of research on compressors while I was looking for one
for my home shop.  To surmise all the research, this is what I've come to
conclude.

Buy as BIG a compressor as you can afford.

That being said, I would think that a 5 hp TWO stage 60 gallon CAST IRON
compressor would be where I would start.  I found one used for about $300, but
that is the low end.  I'd expect to spend about twice that.  New they run more
like $1200 and up.  Expensive, yes...but well worth the money.

&gt; Over the last couple of weeks I've been spending my free time sand blasting
&gt; my window frames. I'm getting close to being done. Wish I didn't have to
&gt; wait for my compressor to catch up all the time. I've got a 5hp 20 gallon
&gt; compressor. What size would be good to run a pressurized TIP 70-s
&gt; sandblaster?
