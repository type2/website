Subject: one year only?

Today i took the dizz out of the 60 crew cab to replace the points,
I knew it was unusual, as the cap is shorter than the others I have
&amp; the points are in two pieces, color of cap is brown. The rotor is 
smaller too.

While talking to the shop manager, he was looking up the part #
for the dizzy, the PO had used a 67 bus engine I knew it wasn't
a 40hp, just didn't know what year it was till now.
Seems this dizzy was used one year only in this year bus engine.
That was I thought unusual.

Points  # 01009
cond    #02069
cap      #03001
rotor    #04006

t tacker
60 double cab
57 oval
70 vert/FS
70 bus
