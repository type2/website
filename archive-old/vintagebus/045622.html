&lt;&lt;Also: is there any easy way to work on the dash wiring
without removing the package tray? You have to remove
the knee buster and the speedo cable to get the parcel
tray out. P.I.T.A.&gt;&gt;

how would you go about doing this? i am in the process of stripping my 64 for 
paint and it does make a lot of sence to take the parcel tray out to work on 
all the electrical because working in really tight spaces is no fun.
info always appreciated-..phil

I think the hardest part of removing the package tray is cleaning all the 
junk off it.    Then again you should find some spare change there.

If you want to mess with wiring, you can drop it w/out removing it if you are 
scared of speedo cable removal.  you still need to get the crud off the tray, 
undo the few screw/bolts at the knee banger, and the few phillips screw bolts 
at the front vertical edge of the tray.   But speedo cables are easy.   
remove hubcap, remove circlip or ppin from cable,    pull cable through from 
other side.  if stuck, remove dust cover, use small thin phillips screw 
driver to push the cable through.   

I would definately remove it all the way for painting the dash of the bus.   
also, I recommend tin foil to wrap the electric wires in, so they dont get 
painted all the same colour.   Colour coded wiring is so much easier to sort 
out than all dove blue (or whatever) wiring.  yo can remove the knobs, undo 
the screw under the switch, remove them from the dash, leave them connected 
to the wires, and just  crunkle the tin foil around the wires and switches to 
cover it from paint, it stays, it is cheap.   Hang the tray to paint out of 
the car, get all the switches polished clean and shiny, reinstall all wiring 
stuff when paint is dry, then put you painted tray in.  Nice.


then agina, I usuallu  dont remve eh tray for minor wiring problem fixings.  
But maybe I have smaller hands than some of you?    My friend Julie is about 
5' 2&quot;  and she has small hands and had no problems with clearance when 
working on her bus.
