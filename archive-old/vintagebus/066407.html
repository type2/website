Subject: RE: [T2] RE: [VB] hooded sweatshirt wanted

Al, who does our shirts AT BBB VII, (yes live printing done at the event)
will have a full assortment of T-shirts, long and short sleeve, sweatshirts
and even undergarments. He will also print the BBB logo on anything you
might want it printed on (if he doesn't have the item). I am going to do a
full set of BBB curtains for my Westy.
