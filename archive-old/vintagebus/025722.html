I am pulling a 36hp from a 59 single cab.  The bottom 2 motor nuts came
off with no problem.  The top is missing one of the studs and nuts all
together, so that was an easy one, but the one on the passenger side
seems to be stripped.  As I turn the nut the stud turns right with it. 
What do I do?????
