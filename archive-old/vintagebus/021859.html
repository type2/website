Check this out:

http://www.pelicanparts_dot_com/techarticles/mult_gas_and_oil/mult_synthetic_faq
.htm

From this article the author recommends the synthetic for longer oil change
intervals, but for 3000 miles the effects are not worth it.

Also I was on the geneberg_dot_com site and he recommends to use dino juice
because he believes that the synthetic does not attract and dissipate heat
well enough.  Granted this may be very old information as synthetics have
evolved over time.

I like to run 20W-50 usually Pennzoil, but am going to switch to Wal-Mart
brand for the price.  At 3000 mile change intervals, an adequate API rating
and SAE starburst symbol there is no benefit to the expensive stuff.  

If I ran a type 4 engine I think I would splurge for the hydraulic valves
and synthetic oil(Mobil 15W-50), and change it every 10,000 miles.

Who said this would not be an oil thread?  ;)
