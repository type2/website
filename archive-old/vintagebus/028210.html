Subject: Re: [VB] 62 Westy wood - where do you get it.....
References: &lt;21.9403672.27eea0c3_at_aol_dot_com&gt;

Ha I know this one..

Birch plywood panel it is called, 1/8&quot; thickness. Home Depot has them, 8' x 4'.
The roof is more challenging as it requires a 5' x 5' measure around the
pop-top, and you have to custom order it.  If you want the wood grain to run
vertically on the panel side behind the driver seat, as that's how the original
ones are, you need a even bigger piece.

I bought 2 pieces of 5' by 5' from Badgerwood, http://www.badgerwood_dot_com/ and
they were shipped promptly via UPS. I havn't checked them yet, still focused on
exterior. I know for a fact there's a wood supply company in 714 area code that
sells 5' x 5' sizes too.. even talked to them over the phone.. Of course I lost
the references. Maybe someone can help with that info.. Taylor?

And of course it's also being provided professionally.
http://classicvws_dot_com/westy-wood.htm That pricetag requires a REAL ambition from
your friend.

Good luck!

&gt; Working on my friends 1962 subhatch Westy......
&gt;
&gt; any idea where to get the real look stuff ? and whats it called?
&gt;
&gt; and are there big enough pieces for the roof, its not bad but  if he redoes
&gt; the side door panels he may get ambitious and  do the  roof.......
&gt;
&gt; Southern California area would be great........
