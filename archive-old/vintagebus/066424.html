Subject: RE: [VB] Spongebob bus source?

  As I look at my bus collection (toy) I am amazzed at how many different
buses I have, in every configuration. The funny thing is they are all 20 or
more years old.
  Today it's all the same generic crap. I do hand it to JL for at least
doing a single cab, now how about a DC, ambulance, high roof, camper
variations, tipper, rescue truck, tow truck, ladder truck  and so on and so
on. It's cool to look at all the different models and not just different
paint jobs.

ronnie   now my new buses are real OLD ones except for the toy ones my wife
buys me

Well, I'd buy one if there weren't any strings attached. 

Here's my splanations...

1. It's the cheapest and best quality. Barbie's microbus will be $5 at the
swap 
meet next year but that's with a years worth of blonde inflicted dents and 
damage. Not true with made-for-collectors overpriced crap like the HW hotrod

bus series. 

2. The more the merrier. We all like to see lots of buses lined up at bus 
meets. I like lots of buses on my shelf too. Squint my eyes and relive the
day. 
(note to self - create D&amp;D type game based on AZ bus weekends)

3. It's a vote. If bus toys fly off the shelves hopefully it'll cause R&amp;D
money 
to enter the stream. A letter to the companies asking for more variety helps

and a &quot;I bought all your same-mold toys, make some interesting models&quot; lends

credibility. A &quot;bus toys don't move&quot; message will stop every bus toy. 

4. It's cultural history. Sponge Bob Square Pants will be as cute as a Buddy
L 
bus in 40 years. Japanese tin buses were cheap and crude in their day, now
have 
charm and value. 

5. Convenience. My mantle can hold a lot more buses than my driveway.

&gt; I have yet to figure out the appeal of all of these commerical
&gt; toy buses.  Every few months, they slap the pop icon du jour on
&gt; the same die, and the bus people go crazy.  I bet if they made a
&gt; Tampax bus these guys would be lining up on ebay to buy them. Why?
