there are 2 universal acc cables available to my knowlage
1 is an aircraft cable with both a bent end and a round end
they come with a end piece and an alan wrench to install the end
after you cut it to the length,with the end you need .

the other is same as above but comes with a 3 foot piece of sheathing
around it, with screw adjustable end for adjustment, these work great
on buses with modified engines as you can control slack in the cable and
seal off the rear  portion of the cable (sheath acts as guide tube)


hope this helps
