Subject: Red &amp; Green Light Film
Date: Sat, 29 Aug 1998 21:45:19 -0700

	 Does anyone have a source for the little pieces of red &amp; green film
that are used in the speedos for the direction/oil/generator lights??
Mine are so faded that they're effectively clear now.  The blue film for
the high beam is in perfect condition though (as they all are I
suspect).  I've looked for a suitable substitute but have come up empty
handed.  Any help would be appreciated.
