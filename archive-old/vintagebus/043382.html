&gt;Yes, you can use the stock [master cylinder push rod] with that spacer.
&gt;How much is the spacer going for now?  Last we heard it was $50.00!

I paid $39.95 .  That and a fuel line ($7.75) cost me $6.63 UPS ground
shipping from Redding, CA to Tulsa, OK.  The spacer comes in a kit
along with the rubber boot for the front of the cylinder, two longer
mounting bolts, two rubber plugs that go into the top of the cylinder
for the tubes on the bottom of the reservoir to plug into, and a
two-page direction sheet.

&gt;&gt;Should the spacer sit flush against the M/C flange?  The spacer is 
&gt;&gt;basically a huge aluminum washer, but the ID is not the same all the
&gt;&gt;way through...it steps down and gets narrower on one end.  I can get
&gt;&gt;it pretty close to flush on the M/C, but the &quot;nose&quot; of the M/C hangs
&gt;&gt;up on the narrower ID of the spacer before the spacer is flush.  Will
&gt;&gt;this fix itself as I cinch it down during installation or is this a
&gt;&gt;problem?  (I have the recommended 71+ master cylinder, 211 611 021 AA,
&gt;&gt;German ATE.)
&gt;
&gt;That is not good!  You will have to have this ID machined properly or
&gt;hand machine it!

Looks like I'll be putting in some quality time with the Dremel, or
a grinding burr and my drill, then.  I have a feeling that the spacer
might fit just fine on the Brazilian master cylinder - I sprung for
the fancy German one.  The part number on the box matches *exactly*
the part number in the directions.  But I've bought enough parts to
know that it's real easy to get the wrong part in the right box...
I may take all the parts concerned to the FLACPS and see what I can
find out.

Mike Anderson thought that I might have been having trouble because
of the rubber boot.  The problem I am having is without the boot
even.  I know it is supposed to go on before the spacer, but I
was leaving it out to see just how much of a clearance problem
I have.

The master cylinder I have is for a bay window bus with brake booster.
Maybe I need the dual-circuit, non-booster late model cylinder?

&gt;Yes, you can the originals [brake line grommets] were cut on one side 
&gt;to allow installation in areas where the tubing was solid or hooked up
&gt;already.

As I found when I finally grabbed the right piece from my pile-o-parts.
My mistake.

Thanks for your help!!
