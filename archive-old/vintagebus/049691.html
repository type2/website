hmmm,

While all the &quot;Christians&quot; are replying ...

I'm deputy editor of an online newspaper.

The Daily Mail &amp; Guardian http://www.mg.co.za/

We do a full online news service from Africa and South Africa, updated all
day every day. First African newspaper online back in 1994.

I'm enjoying hearing about what you all do to feed your bus habits ;-)
