&gt;After looking over this bus, I wonder why it has semiphores as well as
&gt;front turn
&gt;signals?  Why would it have both, unless they were added when it was
&gt;brought to the
&gt;states.

Yeh it's funny. I saw pictures of this bus a few weeks back when I was
considering buying it. I was surprised to see it had the exact same turn
signal holes in the nose that my '59 Euro-spec single cab has. I asked the
list a simular question. No one really knew for sure. You can see pictures
of my '59 SC on my website with the same blinker cut-outs. Don't know who
did it, but they are the same.
