&gt; What year/carb did the intake manifold heat risers get bigger?

Hi Thomas,
Bigger how?  Diameter?  Width between the down turn of manifold ends.  If the 
latter, that happened when the 1300cc engine in the bug came out and 1500cc 
engine for the bus.

  Also do you know which year the beetle came with the 34PICT carb and the &gt; 
&gt; alternator?  I'd like to find one of those manifolds since the carb will 
&gt; clear the alternator.

Not sure about year, but was that not when the FI was installed?  If so no 
carb intake.   Eric&amp;Barb
