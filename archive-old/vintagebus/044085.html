&gt;&gt;They are about 1&quot; square with a rod threaded perpendicular through one
&gt;&gt;side. The rod has a knurled knob and advances a bar that runs parallel
&gt;&gt;to the side with the threaded hole. The opposite side acts as a gate,
&gt;&gt;pivoting on a screw at one end and slipping under another screw to
&gt;&gt;complete the square.
&gt;&gt;These things are great! You can open the gate, put the clamp around 
&gt;&gt;the fuel line, close the gate, and screw the bar down to clamp off 
&gt;&gt;the line.

&gt;They are indeed lab equipment, but I don't know whether or not they're
&gt;still used.  I've got one that I inherited from my father, who used to
&gt;bring home old lab equipment from the university where he taught.  As
&gt;Paul says, they work well on VW fuel lines.

These clips are still used - our stores (University physics dept) 
carries them in various sizes. They are usually listed in Laboratory 
Supplies catalogues as Tubing Clips. Should be able to get them that 
side of the pond......
