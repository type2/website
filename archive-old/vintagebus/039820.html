Hi list, I need some info,:

Are the drive train in split buses the same as pre 67 beetles? and, what is 
the best way to paint a motor, ie, so it wont fade quickly due to heat, ect. 
is powder coating a good solution? ($$$ is outta the picture, I just want to 
see what my options are) (I'm painting a 1500cc engine)

thanks,
Matt
