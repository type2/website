Subject: Re: [VB] More electrical.....

Yeah, you'll never get that to go away, short of replacing every electrical
connector in your bus.  A good start, though, would be the transmission
ground strap.

'75 914 1.8 (for sale)

&gt; I changed my nine prong box to the NOS 11/75 one I had around thanks to
the
&gt; information from Matt, Barb and Eric.
&gt; The turn signal on the old red box was hanging up and I was getting
occasional
&gt; red lights from the generator light at speed on and off. Having said that
this
&gt; never seemed to affect the battery level. AS the cranking power was the
same
&gt; and the bus would start right up every time.
&gt;
&gt; So that has stopped.... but at night with lights on, I still get very
faint
&gt; red glow when brakes are applied or turn signal is used. But a big red is
when
&gt; the wiper motor is pulled on. I have a Bosch alternator with just 20,000
miles
&gt; on it, belt tight, and possible extra demand from Hella H-7's.
&gt;
&gt; Any ideas??
