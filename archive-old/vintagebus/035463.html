Hi David,
Not sure if this applies to the DC, but on our 63 SC one side to side line of 
the holes was centered right over a &quot;U&quot; shaped sheet metal brace that acted 
too much like a rain gutter to nowhere.  We welded all of the holes, and plan 
on moving the location when redrilling this line, forward or just rearward of 
this brace to stop the possible leaking of water into the brace.  Eric&amp;Barb
