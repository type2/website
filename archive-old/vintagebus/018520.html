Just got the newsletter from the Golden Gate VVWCA
with preliminary information on the Spring Meet.  

I quote from the newsletter:

&quot;We are eliminating the modified classes and will no
longer have awards for these classes...We also decided
that we would only let show cars inside the park, this
means no general parking, no non VW's, no dealers, no
New Beetles, etc. We will still have swappers but will
be more selective on sponsors and vendors.&quot;

The date is set for April 22, 2001
