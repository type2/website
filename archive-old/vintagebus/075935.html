Subject: Re: [VB] buying 65' Splitty barndoor info requested

Hi Tracy,

Congrats on your imminent splitty!

What info are you looking for?   If you want someone to look at the 
prospective bus, post where you are (or rather where the bus is), and offer 
some beer.

The archives also have a lot of info, so go ahead and look there, or ask the 
list questions.

FWIW &quot;barndoor&quot; generally means buses buildt early 55 and back, that have a 
huge engine lid. (as big ass a barn door).  The side hinged doors are called 
side doors or double doors (easily confused with double doors both sides) or 
cargo doors.   

I recommend a copy of Muir's Idiot book, which is great for general VW fixits 
and knowhow for the non mechanic.  Also a copy of the Bentley reprint of 
Volkswagen Transporter Workshop Manual 1963,  which shows a ton of Splitty 
specific (written for 63-67 buses when they were new, or actually for 
mechanics to work on them) stuff with loads of black and white pictures of 
clean straight non rusty buses to drool over..

&lt;&lt; Hi everyone, I found a 65' Splitty Barndoor that I'm gonna be purchasing, 
and I was just wondering if anyone had any useful information on these years. 
I own an 85' that I restored, and this one needs alot of work, but I don't 
mind. It will make a nice project for me cause I'm going to school for 
Automotive Technology. I realize that there's a big difference between 
waterboxers and aircooled busses, and I plan on reading up on that 
information. I've owned my bus for awhile now though, and I suspect that my 
knowledge on the bus I have now will come in handy anyhoo. A VW is always a 
VW. But anyways lemme know............
