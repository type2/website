Subject: Re: [VB] free stuff-lowered spindle  question-front beam

glad someone could put these to use again. I'm installing new inside panels
so I might not need original panel fasteners....... do you need these?

second...... I'm about to remove front beam today to prep the front for a
bit of blasting.......... to get rid of all the surface rust from
undercarriage and paint it. Everything there still is in very good condition
despite all the light surface rust from sitting in a barn for 20+ years.
should I dismantle the beam and replace some things?? bushings? bearings?
check leaves? I know NQ did that with his beam. Erin, what should I be
looking at? also on same note..... rebuild steering box?

Thanks all,

Dre

&gt; The free stuff I recieved form Dre was great. It is good to see some part
&gt; move like that. Saturday I got free torsion bars with spring plates from a
&gt; yard I went too, in very nice shape. Bus even sat right, so I can go
without
&gt; much tweaking from stock angle. It is good to know that it isn't all about
&gt; money here, since I need so much damn stuff, not that I expect to get much
&gt; for free.
&gt; I wish I had some 'extra' stuff to help out, but perhaps someday...Right
now
&gt; I am begging yards for OEM bolts and nuts for spares, since I have now
extra
&gt; fasteners around....
&gt; Logistics look like a maiden voyage might be sometime late August, so I
&gt; expect Sept... :) I pick up my engine and my trans should be done mid
&gt; August. Planning on a crunch then... Right now scrubbing undercarriage
(wooo
&gt; fun).
