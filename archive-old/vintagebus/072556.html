Subject: Re: [VB] cargo area divider

I have seen a pretty strange zip in kind of deal for a baywindow that was claimed to be VW. 
 
On a separate but similar idea is there a place that carries the material for those? Are they not made from the tar board material as the door panels are? Anyone know who has that stuff?
