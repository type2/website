Subject: T4 on a budget

I'm wanting to blaze some new personal trails with this T4 design.
Obviously I'll know more as time goes on but couldn't a guy run 34-pict-3
carbs as duals to feed a 2L engine?  Dual webers are nice but then how in
the hell can the average Joe hope to enjoy the benefits of a T4 if you don't
cheat and simplify here and there?

I have a question about making my own manifold.  What are the repurcussions
of welding up your own manifold out of steel?  I suck with aluminum stuff
but I'm wondering why VW used steel intakes on SP engines and then went to
aluminum on the dual port heads of the 1600?

I could weld up a steel manifold for dual 34-pict-3 carbs no problem if I
knew that using a steel manifold wouldn't cause problems.  Is there a
problem with the expansion rate?

Also I figure since the 34-pict-3 runs a 1600cc engine okay, then why
wouldn't 2 of them be able to hack 2L (1000cc's ea)?  Re-jetting may be
required but I bet it wouldn't be that much if any.

Thanks for any insight you guys and glas can provide.
