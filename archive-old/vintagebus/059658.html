Subject: Advice needed-Deck Height. Short block

This weekend, the offensive VWBOB motor will be removed from the beloved
split. She limped up the driveway to the spot for the last time., using
a disconnected spark plug wire and boot to keep the#1 fuel air mixture
from hitting the generator. FUN.
I have two options, spend $$ and get a turnkey from a reputable engine
builder, using my old tin, carb, intake, blah.
Or try and fix this one, which MAY only need new heads.

The question is, is deckheight measurement from piston top suffcient to
determine balance in this area?  I have good rings, rods, bearings, oil
pressure good, end play should check, as it has less than 2k miles, and
spins fine, just shit heads.

What else can/should I check? I figure AFTER new heads can I check lift
and geometry, or should I be checking valve lift now and then as well?
It has (supposedly) a ENGLE 100 cam, and I have no particular reason to
consider it wiped.

Basically, if I have to crack the block, or change pistons (if
deckheight is wrong) I am going direct to new longblock. Can't trust his
workmanship. A notion wish keeps pointing me towards dropping long green
and having a less stressful fall.
