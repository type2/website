Subject: Re: [VB] more oil leak ?'s

one of my volkswagens suffers the same oil-slinging-from-the-pulley problem.  the engine did this from newly rebuilt.  better venting helped but did not stop the oil from making its way past the pulley.  my guru suggested that i get a press-in sand seal and associated pulley.  i was on the verge of buying the set up when the parts guru suggested that this approach was like putting a band-aid on a severed appendage - not enough of a solution and the wrong one anyway.  too many gurus....  now i'm back to doing nothing... well, i am driving slower and that seems to help... or maybe the oil level is too low.

&gt; &lt;&lt; I've got the engine out of my westy right now repairing some oil leaks. I 
&gt; can see the pulley has been throwing some oil. What is the best way to cure

&lt;good advice snipped&gt;
&gt;   After checking all of the above and you still have oil coming out around 
&gt; the pulley it is a good sign that you have too much blowby passing by the 
&gt; piston rings and only an engine rebuild will fix your problem.
