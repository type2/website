NQ:

I've found that using POR-15 on the hard drive, a
Porsche-style fan shroud on the CPU, and
gaska-seal on the computer case will prevent
these nasty windows reinstallation problems. And,
I was told on a linux list that those people had
a way for me to never ever have reinstall
windows, but I won't listen to that sort of
nonsense--who ever heard of such a thing!

-Today is the big day - converting over to DSL so

-I'll probably be offline for a day or 2 while I
-install the network cards and the router.  I'll
-see you online in a couple of days.  Probably
-after having to reinstall windows.
-It's what usually happens. :-)
