I don't think alternators are oh so special, though some people may.  Just 
charges the battery you know.  evidently if you have monster stereo amd mucho 
lights and extra battery and camp and use lotsa electricity it can help,   
though i am told you need a battery attached to run an alternator, and the 
fact is you dont for a generator, which is very useful, or was once for me., 
so don't kick yourself for not getting it, though it could be useful as a 
spare
