Subject: Throwout fork angst:  Solved

Howdy!

In an earlier episode I posted that I was having trouble with lack of
free-play in the clutch pedal of my '66, and that it was related to the
replaced throwout fork.

It turns out, after a call to the PO, that he used the 67 tranny, but for
some reason, kept the early style throwout fork, and thusly, the
earlier-length cable.  So when I put in a later fork, with a different angle
to it, the cable turned out to be too short.

211 721 335 C is the cable to '62, at 31010mm, and what I needed was 211 721
335 B, at 31016mm.  Unfortunately, I couldn't get the right cable quickly,
so I used a bay cable, which is too long.  I used a bunch of bent washers
between the lever and the wingnut, and I had to chop about 2 1/2 inches off
the end of the cable so it wouldn't run into the front engine tin.

Fun.  I'll find the right cable soon...

Gene
