&gt; 1. was the speaker on the bus installed regardless of whether a radio was
&gt; ordered (i know radios were usually installed by the dealer)

The buses I've had that didn't have an OG radio did not have the bracket or speaker.

&gt; 2. which leads to question 2- if a speaker was installed independednt of the
&gt; radio was small phillips screw inserted roughly 2&quot; to the right of the ash
&gt; tray to keep the speaker housing from falling backwards? i have a 1967 factory
&gt; manual that shows a bus w/ this screw but dunno if this is correct for a 65'
&gt; (can you tell i don't like drilling holes??)

I've never seen said haole.

&gt; 3. which leads to question 3 is the metal speaker bracket different on a 1967
&gt; bus than a 1965?? 

Probaly one-year-only ebay $432 starting bid...
