the thom sez:
 &gt; 1963 23 Window Microbus Deluxe Sep. 29, 1999 Price: $12,000 This bus has all original parts including mid.seat- New slightly custom acrylic paint and body work-1600 single port motor-tranny good minus 4th
 &gt; gear-xtra 40 horse orig. motor &amp; tranny incl.
 &gt; *Very nice bus-needs only interior work &amp; a good home-must sell do to lack of
 &gt; funds. 
 &gt; 
 &gt; So, needs and interior *and* a tranny, and it's still $12k?
 &gt; 

I have a '64 Deluxe, runs good, needs interior and tranny - if anyone
wants it I'lllet you have it for a mere $6000 :)
