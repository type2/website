Anybody know off hand what the gas tank size(s) are for various buses?
I thought my 58 would only hold like 11 or so, but the other day I put
in 13 gallons.  I know it's not original cause its got a sender in it.
Just curious...

originally it is the same as any other bus- about 11 gallons.  My 59 SC has a
later bus gas tank in it, which takes about 15 gallons.    The gas cap is
noticably different- A spltty cap wouldn't work for this tank.    BTW, and oil
filler cap fits a splitty gas tank, so that is a way to check
