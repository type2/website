Hi list,

Checked out the merc headlights and they are exactly the same as the units
on my buses.

The Merc part numbers for the headlight units are as follows 322820
1661(left)
and 322820 1761(right). These are the 'euro spec' headlights not the sealed
beam variety and they are set up for right hand drive/left hand side of the
road countries. The lenses are asymmetrical and are therefore not
interchangeable side to side. 

The current price is R699.61 each(the currency here is Rands/cents) and the
current exchange rate is R7.17 to the US$ so they come in at a little under
$100 tax inclusive before freight.

They are available on order from any Mercedes dealership but Johan at the
Sandown Motor Holdings Truck Centre currently has stock.

He can be contacted on 2711 011 444 3980(South Africa is at GMT + 2hrs).
They DO NOT organise shipping themselves. So any shipping will need to be
arranged through a third party like DHL or Fedex or whoever. 

I would be happy to help anyone who would like to get a set of these things
but please note that I will NOT be doing this as a business. I will
therefore not take a cut and I will not do it to any sort of schedule. If I
go and pick up a set it will happen only when I have time available. 

pmail me if you need help or advice.

Later 

Michael
