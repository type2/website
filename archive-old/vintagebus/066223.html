Subject: fixing a rusty gas tank??

First time posting on the VB list, hope you don't mind but I actually have a 
question for my Thing that I just bought....but I figured some of you would 
have dealt with a rusty tank in your splitties.

It's not running very well at all, lots of hesitation and inconsitancys 
while giving it gas, replaced fuel filter and saw rust was in it, so must be 
coming from the tank right?

Is there any tricks or checmicals that you can use to get rid of the rust, 
or should i just spurge and get a new tank.

Thanks in advance for any input.
