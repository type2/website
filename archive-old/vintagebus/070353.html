Subject: Re: [T2] GL4 snipe hunt

Hi,

I never have any problems getting GL4 from NAPA which I belive you 
folks have in Canada. Sometimes they do not have it in the store but 
can get it from the warehouse same day. Last couple of gallons that I 
bought were Stalube brand. If you have an old bottle just give them 
the part# of the bottle they can look it up even if they do not have 
a clue.

&gt;I can find Sta-lube? I know they still make GL4 80-95 wt.
