I've worked with Derric and Barb to get some hard to find stuff and even
made the drive from Houston to pick up some parts.

Derrick walked me around the yard and showed me which buses were open
for parts and the candidates for restoration.  I thought he was
conservative on a few.

He is not often the cheapest but is always one of the best in quality.
It could be these standards that keep him from holding boarderline
buses.  And boarderline buses quickly become parts buses.
