Ok here is the scoop. I am going to sandblast my 65 delux bus soon and I
would like some tips on what I should do before and after. I have never
sandblasted before and I heard it is very messy. But it is alot better
then hand sanding. Today I took out all the windows except the 4
skylight ones but I will get them tommorow.  Some things I need to
know...what should I coverup? When do I know the rust is really gone?
What do I do after it is shiny clean metal? I know I need to primer it,
do I use primer from a spray can or paint brush it on like you do when
you paint your house. The situation is I live here in Germany and I
don't have all the primer brand names like you all have in the states
and I want to take advantage of the hot weather to sandblast the bus
right the first time and prime it right. I won't mind if anyone writes
me a lengthy explaination on what I should do I would actually
appreciate it. So any tips.

Thanks in advance.
Newbie SandBlaster,
Bryan
