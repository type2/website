&gt; also i need to speak to someone who actually has put in a 1600 in an early 
&gt; trans.  i am not going to hog out the bell housing to fit the bigger 
&gt; flywheel.  the combo i want to do as mentioned above will allow me to bolt 
&gt; the flywheel to the 1600 and the 1600 right to the '60 tranny, while still 
&gt; using the 6v starter.  so anything i will run into that i might not think 
&gt; of??  o-rings, problems with clutch?? etc?? 

Nope, should bolt right up.  I had this setup in my '56 bus.
