Subject: hail update :)

well..the hail is over with...sorry for the 2 posts...i just got caught
up in the excitement.  Stella has a few minor dents in her roof
now...but no broken windows.  wahoo!  maybe the roof rack deflected some
of the hail ;-)

now theres just a ton of water everywhere....
the largest i found was golf ball sized...the rest was gumball
sized...but thats about the smallest it got ..
wow...do i ever need to get out of WI!!

oh well.... back to normal now.

have a nice day everyone
