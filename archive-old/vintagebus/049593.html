I have to put in a plug for this eekbayer - I lost a tool  auction he had
by .25 cents; he agreed to duplicate the tools, for the same price... and
threw in another tool. A truly helpful man.
If you have a tool request, buzz him; if he has it, he often will just sell
it outright, as opposed to feebaying it. You need to have the tool NUMBER
tho, as that's how he knows his stock.
I'm putting together a wish list :)

Wish all the sellers on that horrid place were as nice as Mark!
