Subject: Re: [VB] Bentley CD's

If someone who owns the CD wants to send me one of the smaller files,
I'll provide a definitive answer.

&gt; A little (very little) more info on the Mac issue, as I queried Bentley on
&gt; it but didn't get very far:
&gt; While the first Bentley CD's used plain-vanilla pdf's (and therefore were
&gt; cross-platform), the new ones use their Windows-only eBahn reader instead of
&gt; Acrobat.  While I have been told by the sales manager at Bentley that the
&gt; files are still pdf files, none of the files on the new CD's actually have
&gt; .pdf extensions anymore.  So the question is, are the files merely pdf files
&gt; with renamed extensions?  If so, then they may work on Mac via Acrobat, even
&gt; if Bentley doesn't support it, since Mac's don't care about Windows
&gt; extensions anyway.  Or, are the files themselves modified in some way other
&gt; than just an extension change (to prevent their use on anything but theBahn
&gt; reader)?  I don't know the answer to this, and Bentley won't tell me.  All
&gt; they'll say is &quot;sorry, we don't support Mac anymore.&quot;
