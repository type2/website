Subject: Re: [VB] Re: steering wheel colors

It was a pretty original bus when it came to me except for the outside paint
and the huge einstein head and qoute &quot;imagination is more important than
knowledge&quot; It was velvet green front and back. pop top lip looked to be
factory. wood headliner was nice and looked og. column and e brake where
also black. Maybe 67's had it to match the new black rubber knobs?

&gt; that is odd- a 67 westy with a black wheel.
&gt;
&gt; makes me think that either it was not a factory westy,
&gt; or that someone swapped the wheel over.  The vast majority of buses follow
&gt; the commercial /passenger (incl westy) litmus test for wheel colour
&gt;
&gt; on a factory westy the steering column is white, and the interior of the
back
&gt; of the backed is paint the upper colour of the bus.  O a kombi with a
westy
&gt; kit put in the column is black  and the interior of the back of the bus is
&gt; grey
&gt;
&gt; bd standards have black wheels
&gt;

&gt;  &gt;  Not every commercial came with a black wheel. I have
&gt;  &gt;  seen many Westfalia's (kombi's) that have white wheels
&gt;  &gt;  from the factory. Namely my 65!
&gt;  &gt;   &gt;&gt;
&gt;  &gt; ya westy's got white white, like the deluxes and standards- as they
were
&gt;  &gt; considered passnger cars- sort of a special kind of kombi.  Think there
is
&gt;  &gt; only one white
&gt;  &gt;
&gt;  &gt; panels, kombis, trucks got black
&gt;  &gt;
&gt;  &gt; Haven't seen any other colours.  though some black white do turn
chocolate
&gt;  &gt; from heavy sun, esp with the coating worn off.
