Subject: RE: [VB] Paint availability

Maybe this guy is getting pressure from his wife to sell the bus.

He's probably telling her &quot;I have it advertised and everything, it's not my
fault if nobody wants it&quot;, when all the while, he's put such a high price on
it that it could never possibly sell, and he's done this so he can keep it.

Just a thought.  I know that's what I'd do if I was getting pressure from
home to get rid of one of my projects that I really wanted to keep.
Fortunately for me, my wife would never do that, but I know some guys whose
wife's only thoughts towards their busses is that the project has turned
into the money pit.
