Subject: Re: [VB] cigarette lighter?
To: VintageBus_at_type2_dot_com

&gt;&gt;While looking at Dan Howards 57 pics I noticed he mentions an accessory 
cig. lighter, but as far as I can tell it's mounted a little lower. Could 
this be a dealer or possibly a factory option? Maybe I need to pull it out 
and put it on Ebay before I take
it to Rick Taylor! This could be a $300 item! Just kidding Rick!&lt;&lt;

My brothers 67 poptop westy has a lighter in the dash under the grab handle.  
Doesnt match the 67 knobs but pretty close with a cigarette logo on it.  

As far as I know the dealerships installed a wide assorment of various items 
and installed some pretty wacky items to get that money from the customer.  
Customer satisfaction is what its all about.  Say someone wanted a 23 window 
back in 59 but they needed to have a cigarette lighter in it.  The dealer is 
not going to sacrafice a sale of a vehicle due to the customers want of such 
a small item.  Same with mirrors, gauges, etc. etc... If I were a saleman and 
someone wanted some dinky accessory like that I would run my butt to the next 
store that carries it, put it in myself and make the extra commission. As for 
the location It was pretty much whatever works.  If the customer wanted it 
somewhere they would put it there.  Much like the fuel gauge in my 57.  It's 
next to the ashtray????  What kind of person wants to look up there to see 
how much fuel there is?  And the lighter is directly above the headlight 
switch!  Right dab in the way if say you're wearing loose long sleeves.  
Sucker would have its way with that fabric.

Haven't heard any prices on these lighters but my guess is that they are not 
much.  Have seen them everywhere. Just the value of having some extra 
character to your bus. ;)
