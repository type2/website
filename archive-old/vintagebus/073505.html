My new bus has a sooty tank  apparently and
 ive been putting a little plastic one under the tank and changing it every 
 few months but I think im
 going to have to take it out and clean it sooner or later, the silt just 
 isnt going away. &gt;&gt;

soot?  or rust?  

try the magnet on a stick down the gas tank, it works really well for rust in 
the tank.

Personally, I dislike fuel filters under the tank.  Awkward to change, get 
gas in your eye.   I find them on buses that the owner doesn't know they are 
there, usually pretty dirty.  IMO better to have it in the engine 
compartment, where you can see it.
