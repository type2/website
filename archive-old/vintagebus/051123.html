As a far as movie sightings, take a look at Steve McQueen's Bullit.  A
few busses, Red and white in a parking lot, green and white on an
incline, and a pea green pre 62 at the crest of the hill.  Also several
bugs, including an oval on the way down. This is all in the famous car
chase, of course.

CONTENT:
My brake pedal started staying down!  The brakes work fine, I just have
to pull it back up with the corner of my shoe.  What gives?
