Most USA buses I've seen park on the right out of the view of the driver
however, mine park on the left.  Funny thing is that out of the 12 v splitty
wiper motors I have, only one has this funky yellow band around it.  Closer
reading in the Bentley explains that this motor was noise suppressed for use
in buses that came equipped with a shortwave/low band radio.  Since mine
parks on the left, I can only assume then that I have a wiper motor that
would have originally been found on a RHD bus with shortwave radio.  How
cool is that?  Rarest of the rare but who really cares? :-)
