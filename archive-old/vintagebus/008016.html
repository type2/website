Last year at one of the Puyallup WA VW shows/swaps a vendor was selling a
kit to convert a 1600 engine to an air compressor.  As I recall, it used 2
cylinders to do the compressor function and the other 2 to power the thing.

With a high-output alternator installed you'd pretty much have everything
covered.....

&gt;&gt;  Those are cool!  I wonder how much those cost; that would be perfect for
those remote parts runs.

How about a VW-powered generator/compress all-in-one - is that even
possible?  &lt;&lt;
