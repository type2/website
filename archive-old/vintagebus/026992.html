Subject: Gearbox cover color

To all you vintage people out there, I'm in search of some assistance -

Specifically, I was cleaning up some parts this afternoon, and got to
the reduction box covers.  I think that's what they're called - the
piece inside the drum on the rear that has 4 bolt holes and a large hole
in the center for the outer axle?  Anyway, all was going as expected
until I sunk them in some degreaser - they came out orange!  Were these
things orange from the factory?  If so, I'd like to paint them orange,
but all the ones I've ever seen have been a semi-gloss black, similar in
color to the backinging plates they kinda hold in place.  Also, in
cleaning them, they appear to have a small oil galley that may run from
the axle to the lower edge, maybe providing some sort of lubrication for
the axle riding up against the rubber oil seal.  When I did my emergency
brake cables, I looked past all the details going wrong in the back,
I was mainly concerned with getting the e-brake installed and back on
the road.  Now that I am moving to the details of what is wrong with the
rear, I decided to strip everything in the back and take a gander at
everything.  Specifically, I figured I'd repaint, repair, or replace
everything from the drum to the RGB on each side.  I've gotten as far as
removing the backing plate, and wanted to start cleaning up some of the
parts that I have removed, saving the RGBs for another day.  Anyway,
what was that question?  Hmm.........Oh yeah!  Were those metal things
really orange?
