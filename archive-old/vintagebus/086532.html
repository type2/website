&gt; The Keihin carb in my old H***a had a sight glass in each of the float
&gt; bowls which made checking float height really easy.

For a long time, Japanese cars usually also had a sight glass for the
A/C refrigerant level.  Imagine that... you can just wipe the dirt away
from a little window and look, instead of buying a set of gauges...

&gt; I have thought about drilling and tapping the Solex float bowl for a
&gt; sight glass (McMaster sells NPT-threaded sight glasses as small as
&gt; 5/8&quot;), but the walls of the casting might be too thin.

I think you might be right about NPT; if you used a fitting with a
flange and a rubber gasket on the outside, and a nut on the inside, it
might work.

I wonder if you could machine a fitting to go in the main jet holder
and/or float bowl plug hole?  I'm thinking something like a brass rod
with the right threads on one end and a hole in the side for a press-fit
glass tube.

It'd be kind of hard to calibrate, but you might also be able to stick a
piece of stiff wire down the bowl vent tube and non-surgically figure out
where the float level is.
