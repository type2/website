I've used Forward Air to ship video games and large
things.

You have to crate them and take them to a terminal
(uaually near a major airport - check their site for
lists www.forwardair_dot_com) and it's COD. The buyer pays
shipping at pickup.

It was about $100 for a video arcade game. 

Just another option.
