Subject: Oktoberbus

Yes indeed! It's that special time again where we all get dressed up in
earth -tone clothes, paint our faces with ochre and the blood of a small
furry OH WAIT!! wrong event. This one's the long-awaited Oktoberbus!! 

Y'all have waited, some patiently, some not so patiently but here it
comes again. Every year, the second weekend of October brings out the
finest of campouts, with just about all the camping you can take. We've
tried each year to bring some form of theme to entertain and amaze. Last
year was the wedding year. How could they possibly top a wedding? 

They can't. YOU can! 

This year we dig up that coolest of holidays, Hallowe'en. Decorate your
bus, your site, and you. Trick or treating for the kiddies Saturday
night. Wonderful prizes for best bus, best site, and best costume. 

More info can be found at the following URL (as soon as I write the web
page)

Seeya there
