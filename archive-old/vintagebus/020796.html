Subject: Re: [VB] curtains and curtain rods ?

Got any late-model westies in the local junkyard?  Ifso, you can
pull the curtain rods out of it, and modify them to fit your 
windows - the profile of the extrusion is identical.  Here's what the
early (59-&gt;67) westy curtain rod profile looks like:

&gt;    A lady at work is going to sew some curtains for my 67 kombi/camper and I

&gt; the curtain rods look like.  I was going to fabricate some and would like to 
&gt; get some ideas where to start before I give her the dimensions of the 
&gt; curtains I will need.  I don't care that much if they are stock or not.  She 
&gt; sewed some really nice bright parrot curtains for my old 69 westy with 
&gt; matching throw pillows.  It was a nice touch.
