List:

I'm also getting ready to have my motor built, or I was anyway until I started thinking again.  Plus a chat I had with Greg Noble (aka frankiehil_at_aol_dot_com) over the weekend propelled me into a different thought process.  Greg is good for that.   :)

All along I've had this goofy notion that putting in an all NOS 36 hp original standard motor would be the cool thing to do.  And granted, it would be cool.  But I also know that myself and my family are planning to put the '59 Westy out on the road quite a bit over the next 25 years.  Then for SOME reason, the thought FINALLY hit me.  We're going to be going real slow in a fully loaded camper propelled by a 36 hp motor.  Screw cool, we're dyin' in here!!!!

I could use some list input, as I know I don't always think about everything or take all into account when I'm up to something.  I'm looking for any and all feedback, good or bad as to why I should stay with the 36 or dump it.  Now some have told me to go both,  build up the NOS 36hp motor and use it for shows, and to just have it for whatever, or when you decide to sell the bus.  Well, I hope to not sell the bus, and I also have no plans on showing it.  Yes, I plan to take it to as many shows as I can, but I really would rather not show it.  I don't need the scrutinty, I give myself enought of that by myself.  Plus, I can't afford 2 hot shot motors, only one.

Help!!!

Robert
