Subject: 15&quot; tire specs from VW

Here is specifications for tires from the Official VW Workshop Manual,
published by Bently.

These are the tires VW used and recomended for the old splits.  If not
using bias plys at least the dimmensions may help someone in searching
for close to correct radials.

By the way the Firestone 6.40-15 Bias plys I recently bought from Coker
tires are 4 ply rated, with a 27.1&quot; diameter and 6.61&quot; width...about as
correct size as one is going to get.
