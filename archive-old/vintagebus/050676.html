Subject: RE: [VB] Do I need to take the engine out? (neophyte Q)

I had a flywhell com off one time that did the same thing. It was harder and
harder to shift and then everything just jammed. The grinding noise it made
while deburring the inside of my bell housing made you grit your teeth!

I'm assuming that this mild bang and assorted clunking noises
stopped your forward progress? Also assuming that you meant that
the wheels wouldn't move at all in any gear while up on the
stands? IF that was what you meant, then perhaps your pinion gear
broke off or tranny input shaft broke? Hard to say with your
description. Either way would require engine removal along with
several other quite large bits of the car like the transaxle.
Doesn't matter how long you've been driving splits, because this
doesn't sound good for anyone if I've interpreted your message
correctly. Post some more info and maybe we can help more...

&gt;
&gt; If I describe the problem well, and ask for help nicely....
&gt;
&gt; shifting was getting a little stiff from 2&gt;3 &amp; 3&gt;4, starting
heading home
&gt; shift from 2&gt;3 after stop sign and a mild bang followed by some
whirring and
&gt; a bit of clunking in the back end.
&gt;
&gt; Clutch pedal has feel.
&gt; engine will run and sounds normal.
&gt; Can move shifter into all positions(that are supposed to do
something)
&gt; Put up on jackstands and started it, put into gear and nothing
no wheels
&gt; movement in any gear.
&gt;
&gt; This may be old hat for some but I'm still trying to get to my
first hundred
&gt; miles in a split.
