Subject: Early brake parts needed
Mime-Version: 1.0

In about 1 week I am taking a magical journey to New Mexico and back.  

The '54 Kombi I am driving back needs a few parts.  On it's journey last 
year from North Carolina to New Mexico the seals in the NOS front wheel 
cylinders blew out.  Although they were &quot;new&quot;, they were dried out.

What I need are (4) 211 611 627, which are the 22mm seals (or &quot;cups&quot; as 
my 1958 parts manual calls them).

I have some 211 611 637 22.2mm seals for 3/55 &amp; later rear wheel 
cylinders.  Has anyone ever tried using them in the 3/55 &amp; earlier 
front wheel cylinders?

If I can't find the seals, I need to find wheel cylinders, which are 
211 611 057.  The first person to suggest getting them from J.C. Whitney 
has to kiss &quot;Everywhere&quot; Ed O'Donnell on the lips...

I will be travelling from August 6th-20th.  I will try to meet a few 
listmembers in Phoenix on possibly the 8th or 9th if I can work that out.
If there are any listmembers who want to meet up with me on my way back 
to Atlanta, I'll probably be heading back here the 17th-20th.  I hope to 
be doing the Grand Canyon and Carlsbad Caverns thing the 10th-16th if 
anyone is interested in that.

Thanks for any help you can provide with the front brake parts.

Dave
