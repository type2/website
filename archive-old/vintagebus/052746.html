Subject: Re: [VB] Christmas Question &lt;friday&gt; 

As for me I'd settle for a ten dollar-four finger bag of creeper dope ala 1973,
Jesus, family and the Southern Baptist Convention to look the other way, George
Clinton/Bootsie Collins/Rick James, Dub Miller and Hank Senior on the
turntable, a month off of work, an opportunity to and the where with-all to do
a Spring season FreeloopII tour in Beto's walk-thru bus and Vannessa Williams
under the spell sitting... ah, um, across the room and another one of those
Kyle Tillman/Jim Burnite cigars. Outside of the effects of FatTire Amber and/or
Four Peaks Tenth Street Ale I wish for Peace on Earth and one of those hand
built 1911 style wooden gripped single action polished titanium .40 custom jobs
that saw the other day and the chrome stripped off of every trailer hitch in
the land.
Oil spot my butt, I want some *funk* for the holidays! =)
In reality, I am changing poopy diapers of a two year old and celebrating
Christ's birth and mourning the sale of everything VW that was formerly in my
garage...
