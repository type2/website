Subject: Re: Number 2 cylinder

I went out and checked those items, I decided to try another known good 009
with a new cap, replaced the spark plug with a new one and set the timing
staticly to 7 degrees btdc.  I have the same problem occuring, if I remove
spark plug wire 2 it runs smooth when I plug it back in it makes a popping
noise.  I'm not good at changing noises into words I have a wav file of it
http://stevesbus.sytes_dot_net/engine.wav the first part is with #2 plug wire on
half way through is with #2 plug wire off.   I'll Try Steve Bradleys
suggestion as soon as I can borrow a compression tester.  I checked and
rechecked the torque on the heads before I installed the engine but could a
loose head cause this?  Would a compression test confirm this?  These are
new pistons and cylinders so it didn't occur to me that I could be losing
compresssion.


&gt; Hi Steve,
&gt; Your 009 really should be timed staticly for 7 degrees BTDC.  Then try
&gt; changing the spark plug and later the distributor cap.
