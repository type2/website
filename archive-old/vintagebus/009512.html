Hippies and yuppies
Young and Old
Rich and Poor

I have been into VW's about 20 years now, 30 years if you count the bus =
my Mom bought new.  Over that time I have met a lot of VW people.  They =
have come from all sorts of social and economic backgrounds.  However, =
there seems to be a few similarities among them.

Pack rats!  Man do these people accumulate stuff.

Non-conformist.  Even the &quot;corporate&quot; type VW nuts are different in some =
way.

Fanatical.  What percentage of your T-shirts have some sort of VW on =
them?  What percentage of the walls in your house have something VW =
oriented hanging on them?

Can you think of anymore?
