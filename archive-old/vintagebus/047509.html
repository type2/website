This reminds me of an experience I had a few months ago.  I was given an 
early 70's Ghia convert if I'd haul it away, so I went out with my generator 
and sawzall, cut off the nose, cut off the hinges on the driver's door, and 
when I opened the passenger door, the vehicle folded in half.  Got it back to 
Albuquerque, and traded most of the parts for bus parts!
