I must be on a low cycle or something.

Night before last I was reconditioning the speedo from my 65 standard.  Had to take it apart to get at the translucent plastic over the turn signal indicator (at top instead 
of bottom as on my 65 bug).  I got all the warning light plastic repositioned so it looks &quot;fresh&quot; but during handling managed to break the speedo needle!  Doofus.  
Especially since the speedo otherwise looks &amp; works fine.  I reglued it with a tiny sliver of wood as a splint.  We'll see.  BTW the brown color of the face was a bit of a 
surprise (I thought it was dirty glass) and really looks nice.

Then yesterday I went to test run a small boat (I'm looking for one to tow behind my 71 westy) and met the seller at the ramp.  Launched fine, started right up, fizzled 
out, and then 30 minutes of me &amp; him pulling the starter cord with no luck while we drifted.  Kinda puts a damper on one's enthusiasm for a boat, although this one had 
an excuse: 1957 hull with 1955 motor that hasn't been run much since last year.  I told him to call me when it was running.  Today my arms feel like Popeye's from all 
the pulling (and paddling back to the ramp).  

So last night I'm looking to hook my almost free (notoriously inaccurate, of course!) junkyard VDO gauges to the fuse box of my 65 bus.  I go to pull a connector off the 
back and the fitting comes apart - two pieces: one with tangs for the faston connectors, one with a tang for the fuse.  Looked like the two pieces were supposed to be 
stuck together, so I went into the shop and plugged in the solder gun.  During the process the gun fell apart, but I got it back together without burning myself[1] and 
was actually able to probably-not-cold-solder the two pieces back together.  Back to the bus, it won't fit into the slot on the plastic fuse holder due do thickness of 
solder!  Spent 30 minutes fiddling and managed to break the plastic.  Colorful language.  Realization that the pieces probably didn't need solder as the slot is so tight 
(insert your favorite simile here) that it apparently pinches them together for continuity.  Found a spare fusebox from a 65 beetle and hooked it mostly up (though it's 
different layout) and got disgusted because I didn't have enough piggyback faston connectors.  Took the original fusebox to the shop and managed to get it back 
together &amp; glue the broken plastic and said &quot;I'm gosh darned tired of this fudging thing tonight&quot; or words to that effect and gave up for the evening.

Oh and after all this I realized I was trying to pull off the wrong connector in the first place - I wanted switched (15), not unswitched (30) circuit.

So I'm taking tonight off from mechanicorestoration (he says).  Hoping the planetary alignment will improve.  And smiling BIG!

[1] 1974, high school, 65 bug, putting in stereo, cool evening, walking around in socks in garage, pencil-type solder gun plugged in on floor.  Smelled something.  
Something funky.  Something burning.  Solder gun melting through sock, as I'd stepped on it and was indeed actually standing on it for a few seconds.  Hurts a little, 
but not anywhere nearly so much (oh no sir) as it did when I finished, went inside, and my feet started thawing out.
