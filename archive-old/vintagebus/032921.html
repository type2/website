 What do y'all think about putting a Type 4 cooler in a dog house engine
 for a Type 2? I've been considering this for a couple years, since I
 built my first Type 4 bus engine. Bob Hoover's statement about the
 doghouse cooler being good to 2000cc (I think that's right) made me bag
 it in favor of engine balancing and paying attention to compression
 ratio. Now the VW Trends article and a list question have raised my
 curiosity. Has anybody on the list tried this? 
  &gt;&gt;
Hi, 
We have been trying this for the past 20,000+ miles on our 1960 panel with
1641 single port with modified stock tranny with 3.875 R&amp;P driving at 63-65MPH
just below 3,000RPM and we have been getting cool oil temp readings, high oil
pressure, and getting 25+MPG average.   While the doghouse cooler might be
considered good for up to 2000cc, then why did VW make the investment to
manufacture the type 4 cooler?  Ansewer, to help the air cooled engine survive
high outside temps (80+ F.) by making this cooler 40% bigger.  This is only
one of many reasons that the type 4 engines last 200,000+ miles instead of the
type1, 2, in the pre-1972 bus rarely last more than 80,000 miles without a
rebuild.  We know of a little old lady who drove her 1970s bug for over 30,000
miles with the dog house cooler stand not drilled through from the factory.
So the oil cooler never worked.  Because she only used it for short distances
in town it never quite smoked the engine till she decided to see a friend who
lived over 30 miles down the highway.    Eric &amp; Barb
