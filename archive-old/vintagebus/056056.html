Hey,  whats that screeching sound???

Its the sound of burning rubber leaving Lake Havasu City.....heading East. 
I bet people in Albaqurkee and central CA are slaming the doors on trucks

&gt; If anybody is interested I have rediscovered a hidden VW junkyard down in
&gt; Altus Oklahoma that has a ton of stuff in it. I say rediscovered because
I
&gt; was stationed there in the Air Force until 1990 when I got stationed in
&gt; Japan. I discovered this place by accident , it's located at the end of
the
&gt; runway (north) just off of Altus A.F.B in a big huddle of tree's. The guy
&gt; who ran the place only let me back there one time to retrieve a part for
my
&gt; 59 bug and that was it. Well apparantly he is now very close to departing
&gt; this place we call earth, or already has, and his junkyard now belongs to
&gt; his son who also not very far behind his father, I learned all this from
the
&gt; mother who lives in the house right in front of the place. Anyway from
what
&gt; I could see from my driveby's is that he has panels, deluxes and standard
&gt; splittie's back there along with bugs and type 3's and whatever else in
the
&gt; very large garage next to the house.. The mother that lives there told me
&gt; that the estate was being settled by their lawyer who I assume lives in
&gt; Altus. It's a very small town out in the middle of nowhere so it probably
&gt; wouldnt be hard to track down this person. There is one VW enthusiast
there
&gt; but I have never met him, He had a 21 deluxe a doublecab and a bug by the
&gt; side of his house that you could tell were in work, and very nice and
&gt; complete but he wasnt home when I was down there a month ago. I live to
far
&gt; away right now to investigate further and really dont have the time also
so
&gt; if there's anyone else willing to &quot;road trip&quot; it there and check it out
you
&gt; might find a nice stash or new project if your lucky, good luck.

&gt; P.S. Altus is in the very southwest corner of Oklahoma near the texas
&gt; border........
