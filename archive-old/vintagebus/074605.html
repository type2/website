Subject: dual battery wiring

greetings... i recently acquired a '77 westy and want to hook up the dual 
battery set-up. i know this isnt a 'split' bus inquiry, but i know people 
have installed these in their splits... i was going to.

anyway, does anyone have a wiring diagram? i have searched the archives and 
have come up with one, but it doesnt seem to make sense with the terminals 
that are on the OEM relay. im just needing to know what wire goes to what.

TIA!
