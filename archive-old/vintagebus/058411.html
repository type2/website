Subject: RE: [VB] Run the thermostat or not?

I would listen to Eric And Barb on this. Yes, you see a LOT of used engines
without their factory thermostat and flaps, but how many miles are on them?
From raw experience in the eighties, I can tell you that a motor with the
thermostat and flaps in good operating order on a good motor will outlast
one without the proper equipment. I have built hundreds of motors and dozens
for myself, my experience says go with the thermostat and flaps on street
engines. If you are racing or sand bogging, that is a different situation.

Hi Carl,
Yes, but then it cools down so much especially when idling and hardly
reaches 
a minimum of 160 oil temp to keep not only the water vapor out of the oil, 
but also keep alot of raw fuel out of the oil!  Plus you get better ring 
longevity and better sealing (= more HP) when up to proper engine temp.  
Lastly your engine does not tear itself slowly apart due to constantly 
changing shape and size due to these large fluctuant engine temps.
