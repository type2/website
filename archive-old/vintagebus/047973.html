ok then- my 57 single cab has all ivory knobs :
e-brake,turnsignal,heater,lights,fresh air selection knob, gear shift etc
but yet it has a black steering wheel and the base of the turn signal
assembly is black......does this make sense? Are all single cabs considered
commercial? my bus has been sitting since the 60's and seems basically
untouched but it has a chrome ashtray and grey upholstery (which ive been
told are not correct). Anyway there could of possibly been a button color
option? and if you say &quot;no- impossible&quot; then is the overhead air selector
knob supposed to be black also?-----Original Message-----

trucks are commercial type 2 s

should be black.  easy to switch knobs.   I am not saying there couldn't be
an option for different knobs colours, but I have never heard of it and I
with he black wheel seems ike black it is and yes the overheard air direction
knob thing should match too.
