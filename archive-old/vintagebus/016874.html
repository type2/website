It seems DanBashing is a cylical thing - is it a full moon or something?

Yeah, I wish I had some of that stuff too, but I'm trying to contain my
parts aquisition.  I've been clean for a few months now - only buying stuff
that I actually need for my cars.  I actually went thru a period where I
was buying split-window bug stuff, thinking I was going to buy one.

Every time I dig thru the stash, I find something I didn't know I had! 
Unfortunately for me it's things like NOS super-beetle taillights, and
not 3rd brakelight lids.  BTW, *Dan* Howard (any relation?) is looking
for one.

I'll be warming up the checkbook here pretty soon, as the '54 will be coming
home, wanting love and money.  Kinda like a wife, but without putting
it's cold feet in my back in the middle of the night.  And I don't have
to worry about unexpected offspring.  Take that back - buses *do* breed
if you're not careful!
