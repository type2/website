we still don't know what year the bus in question 
is. 

straight shifter busses (pre- mid 59) don't have an 
alignment pin in the shifter/slot in the shift rod. the shifter will spin all 
day long and there's nothing to do about it.

after that (mid 59), the shifters have an 
alignment pin, whick keeps the bend in the shifter facing towards the rear, 
and there is a slot in the front shift rod that engages the pin to keep it from 
spinning. these shifters should not spin. if they do, the pin is broken or has 
fallen out and the way to remedy this would be to re-fit a pin or replace the 
shifter altogether.

so what year is the bus in question?

    I ordered a shift extension and put that bad boy

  on, it was great until I 

    realized the entire shifter spins and sometimes

  twsits the extension all the 

    way around. Makes for a unique and undetermined

  shift pattern,  Is there a 

    way to get the shifter to keep from 
spinning???
