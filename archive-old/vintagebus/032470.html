&lt;&lt; why do you folks bolt the side step on? theft? &gt;&gt;

My bus with the side step is a camper, and already had holes in the 
jackpoints for the small side tent, and my step came w/o the original 
hardware, so I just drilled a hole and put in bolts.  Could have used a pin, 
but bolts are easier to come up with.
