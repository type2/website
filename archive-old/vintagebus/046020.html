&lt;&lt; jp told me one time that as far as he could determine the crows foot rims 
were outfitted on commercial type2s for just one or two years - '63 and '64 i 
think.  he said he'd not found any information that stated whether the rims 
were installed both front a rear or just rear.  his truck now sports a 
complete set (including spare) though his truck's production isn't within the 
years these rims were used.  is this information of jp's inaccurate?  is 
there some source that has the specifics?
  &gt;&gt;
you can see a manufacture date on VW rims, crows foot or not, to tell when 
the rim was made.   cant see vw bothering to put different ones front and 
rear.
