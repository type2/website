 I was buying some parts last week when a guy with a single cab arrive to the 
shop after a 
 while I decide to start a conversation with him in order to see the bus, 
because the bus has a 
 very very strange cargo comparment, the thing is somethin like the canvas 
cover that you 
 can find in a Single Cab but is made of aluminiun with folding gates at both 
side of the bus, 

=========
great !! can you take a picture of it?

-----
 I live in Venezuela and maybe thats why the bus is dating 64 in the 
identification papers but 
 still have bullets front turn signals.
 I found this numbers in the plate behing the passegers seat
 
 02 05 3
==========
build date 2nd May 1963 ... this means it is a 63 model.  It may well be 
registered as a 64.   I think bullet front turn signals and the oval 
taillight like the ones on 62-71 buses is normal for buses sent to south 
America
-----------------------
 
 363 056 085 121 176
========
M codes- extras the truck came with like Thom wrote
-----------------------
 
 VIN # 1064539
=============
the bottom line should have a two letter port code, then a 4 digit model 
code, then either 6 digit colour code or the colour name written, then the 
VIN.   I didn't look you VIN up, but since Thom suggested you transposed the 
digits, that may be because he looks up the VIN and saw it being from early 
in FEb 63 production.
-------------------
 
 ligths correspond to this bus and if a rear bumper of a1970 could be 
acomodate in this bus, 
 since tha actual owner change the stop ligths with a bay windows stop ligths 
=====================
ya, I believe a bumper from a 70 will bolt on.  I fact I think I have done 
that.
well, if they are the oval tailllight,s I would think they are what the truck 
came with.  If they are the tall rectanngular later bay bus taillight, no way 

Single cab?  look for rust in the compartment under the truck bed.

happy VWing
