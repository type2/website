Did you try checking your solenoid. When I took my first big trip, Boston to
Houston, my solenoid started acting up, and then completely died. IF you read
the idiots manual, it explains how to short it or something, I am not sure
exactly how you would explain it, basically you use a large screwdriver,
across two terminals. It shoudl soudn like the engine is turning over, then it
should start properly. I think it has something to do with the inside of the
solenoid rustin out or something.

Good luck.
(hope that was clear)
