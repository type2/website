Subject: RE: [VB] Buses and Balloons


   Got a call from JP, he made it home with his new 58 single cab and also
got a call from J and R they made it back with both buses.

   For those that care Jon Furst had an engine problem on his way to Jerome
and left his Westy at my house. He got a new engine (long block) in NM
thanks to JP and brought it to Havasu to swap out. He started at 8 a.m. in
the morning, pulled the old engine, swapped all the parts over, had it
installed and running around noon. Took him about 4 hours to do a complete
engine and parts swap, but when you have a Hazet toolbox full of every
GERMAN tool known to man to fix VW's it makes things easy. I was having fun
looking through his tool box at all the special tools he had, especially the
RGB bearing puller, WHAT a tool. I am going to order one from him $200.00
dollars hurts, but I have never seen a puller like it before.

Thanks to all the NM group for a fabulous show see you all next year at BBB

Hey Kyle,
Yeah, supplying Tequila and coffee the next morning to the locals was such
a pain.:)  I was thinking it was pretty bad of me that I had to drink
coffee that came from Arizona, but it sure was appreciated. Thank you.
Kyle and Dede are hospitable folks.  The Arizona crowd is greatly
appreciated
at Busses and Balloons and the event sure wouldn't be the same without them.
As I understand it, there probably wouldn't be B&amp;B without the ABC.
I thank JP, Alex of Foreign Aide and their crews for all the effort.
This year was a great event.
Hopefully Jon and Rachel are home or well on their way from Ronnie's and
JP has returned from Havasu with his newest project behind his nuclear
55 Chevy panel.

John K.
