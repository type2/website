Subject: New Tire for My '58 SC
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

I finally bit the bullet and bought new tires for my '58 SC.  I got Michelin
205/75-15's, LTX tires.  What a difference in the ride.  They replaced some very
old (but plenty of good tread) Continentals (6.40x15) bias ply tires that were
on the truck when I bought it in '92.  When I first saw the Michelins mounted on
my stock rims (crows feet), I was afraid they were too wide to fit in the rear
wheel wells, but they did, barely, with the truck jacked up to let the drums
hang down as far as they can.   The ride is soooo much smoother.

I kept the old Contentials and the tubes.  I wonder if they're worth anything?
