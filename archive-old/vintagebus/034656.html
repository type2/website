&lt;&lt; Hi,  Got a good source for wide white walls for my pickup?  &gt;&gt;
Hi John,
http://www.universaltire_dot_com  has a 2-3/8&quot; wide white wall Firestone in a 
6.4x15&quot; bias ply for $90.00 though they are a little wimpy with a wieght 
limit of 1190 Lbs.  Or Bridgestone 3&quot; white walls for $98.00.  Best to check 
your local magazine stand for a copy of Hemmings Motor News for many more 
tire suppliers.  That way you can compare tires, wieght ratings and prices.  
Be sure to also check how close you are to each tire supplier to keep the 
shipping charges down.    Eric&amp;Barb
