I had this problem in my Type 34 Ghia dual carb 1600 pancake motor. The mixture

was to rich my mechanic said and that will cause it to stall out when braking.
But check to make sure everything is tight as John says. It should be a simple
fix. The mixture screw should be either a big dial or small thumb screw on the
(facing carb) left bottom side of the carb I believe. It's not the set screw
connected to the accelerator cable as that would be the idle set screw.

&gt; When the bus is well into its operating temperature range it stalls upon
&gt; deceleration. For example, Running at 45 miles an hours and approaching a
&gt; stop light I slow down in gear, put it in neutral and it dies.
&gt; My guess is this is carb related as all the ignition stuff is new but I have
&gt; not gotten around to rebuilding the carb. Any thoughts?
