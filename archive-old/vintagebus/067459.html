Gotta keep this msg tight...

Kudos to all who presented the Buses by the Bridge VII event over this past
weekend. Well controlled/handled in instances where it counted, well attended,
perfect weather and TURF meeting SURF (water) for a change. No, not at DelMar
but if I said grass everyone would mentally jump in the wrong direction. In
Arizona it is great to camp on someting green rather than dirt for a change.
TURF was great for kids of all ages.

My wife Paula expressed appreciation by stating that this past weekend was more
fun and relaxing than any event since our 1998 trip up to Seattle for the
Vintage meet.

EXCELLENT SHOW! more comments later...
