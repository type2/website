Subject: Re:Hoops on a binz question

Personally i would fab a small bracket and weld the nuts to it for it to
attach, thus not defacing the orginal bed as it was built , but that's my
outlook. If you prefer i could butt weld it as i do most things now days,
just a matter of what YOU want or prefer. sorry for the slow response.
