&gt; I haven't ever seen the VW program that the History Channel made. Is
it all
&gt; about the bug, or does it cover the bus too?

It covers the entire range, but concentrates on the sedan.  One
striking piece of video shows dozens of barndoor buses (and nothing
else) being driven around a circle.

Well worth watching, IMO.
