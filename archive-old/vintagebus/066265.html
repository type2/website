Subject: Berg Extractor and tow hitches

I was reading the Berg parts book last night and came across an interesting 
item.  It is an extractor header system with single quiet pack muffler that 
clears for a tow hitch.

Anyone running these things?

Or the other alternative is to get a regular header system from Bus Boys and 
save a few dollars...  Worry about the trailer hitch later.

Who knows the hitch might fit anyway?

Speaking of hitches... Did we ever find anyone making them these days?  I 
really do not want to have to make my own.


Thanks,
Adrian
