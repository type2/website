How about finding one used?

If you're going to just do a few welds here and there, the cheep one might
work, but one problem I saw with a cheepie that had sat a while is the
parts inside corroded; perhaps that could happen with any welder, but it
made this one example almost unuasble until I got in there and did some
spiffing up; the drive works were rusting and wouldn't feed the wire.

I like my Lincoln 100 (predecessor to the 115); I bought it several years
ago when I was working on the '56; my first welding project was welding
in a sunroof clip.  I've done a LOT of welding with it!  I've gone thru
about 4 25# spools of wire, and almost finished with a 5th, and countless
tanks of gas.

&gt; Everyone that does a lot of welding seems to recommend the Lincoln or

&gt; others, our welding will consist of a few panels on our own busses and
&gt; that's about it. After that the unit will likely sit. Do we really need
&gt; the high priced unit? I rarely drive a screw and when I do, my cheap
&gt; Black &amp; Decker unit does the job just fine. Can anybody recommend a
&gt; welder that won't bust the budget?
