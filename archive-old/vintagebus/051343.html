Subject: Brake Questions?!?

Ok, I am hopefully getting a '58 panel (maybe even a '59, who knows).  I
have everything to do the brakes on a 1964 but now have no use for all of
those parts.  I was wondering, will the backing plates, and drums bolt on to
the earlier spindles?  I know that the whole front suspension is different
on the 64-67 years, but this would save me a bundle of money since I have
all new drums, wheel cylinders, bearings, etc... for this '64 but not the
58.  I don't want to change the whole beam, and wanted to know what my
options are.

Thanks
Charles
