Subject: bay window roof rack on an pre-67 bus

Should a bay window roof rack fit on my 60? I thought it would as I have an
after market adjustable roof rack that I think came from a VW dealership .. it
came off of a bay but fit fine on my 60 ... but as i said it is adjustable.

I have a non-adjustable roof rack that came off of a sunroof bus ... I was
hoping it would fit on my early bus ... but now I don't think it will ..
should it?
