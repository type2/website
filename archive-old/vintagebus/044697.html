&lt;&lt; I have been asking myself why the 1967 model year had so many parts that 
were 
 only 1967. Having recently aquired a new-2-me '67 Westy and unloaded a '67 
 parts Westy I made every attempt to remove swap out parts that I thought 
were 
 '67 only.
 Can the &quot;List&quot; give me an understanding of which parts are '67 only. Also I 
 work at 1 of the Big 3 as a production supervisor and can only think that 
the 
 reason that the parts were '67 only was that a parts redesign was needed 
 because of faulty design, safety improvement or a cost savings. Either way, 
 any parts change whether it be on the chasis line, trim line or motor line 
is 
 a major logistic, labor and scheduling headache. 
  &gt;&gt;
VW made changes all the time to the buses.   Not just at change of production 
year, but many many many mid year at some random time.   this happened at the 
beginning of 67 ( ie 12V standard equipment, change to L series keys, no 
church key on gas door), and at points in the 67 production year (ie dual 
circuit brakes, back up lights)   Then for 68 they made many many changes.

why did they change the keys/handles on dec 18 63?  why introduce a new style 
tranny and engine May 19 59?   They made lots of changes throughout bus 
production, and did not subscribe to the change only at model year beginning 
theory.
