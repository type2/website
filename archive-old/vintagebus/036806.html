&lt;&lt;  I like Loctite #518 
 ($$$) for a flexible sealant and I think that Eric and Barb prefer
 Permatex Aviation sealant (??  sorry if info is incorrect).  &gt;&gt;
Hi Todd,
Actually we have found that high temp silicon sealant works wonders here if
one finger paints a very thin layer on each of the paper gaskets made from
writing paper and thought all that painting training you got in kindergarden
was going to waste.  We also use this sealant to seal the slit in the
replacement tranny boots to keep out the road dust from getting into the
tranny.  Again less is more.  Also we use telephone paper(Lots of usable paper
in the lawers section.) as a gasket and a little sealant to seal the reduction
box halfs and finally we use striaght silicon sealant to seal the 1964-67 plug
on the inside of the redution gear boxes to the swing plate.    Eric &amp; Barb
