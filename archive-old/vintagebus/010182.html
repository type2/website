Greg - I have some glass that very nearly matches your description... write
me and I'll let you know what I have.  I have to defend you a little bit  so
I have responded to Chad below :)

Hello Chad,
    Is it really necessary to berate a fellow listee because of the way they
prefer to fix up their bus?  I don't know anything about you so I won't make
any comparisons to you, but I do know Greg, and he has traveled to more VW
shows than most anybody I know.  He is definitely not afraid to drive his
bus and I really doubt if he would actually miss the show based on not
having glass.  Last year he drove an all original bus with a 36 HP motor,
bias ply tires, and original interior from Northern Los Angeles, CA to
Phoenix, AZ to pick me up on the way to the Kelley Park show near San Jose,
CA, adding probably 10 times the distance to the trip it would have taken to
go straight there.  And added to that, we took dirt roads half way across
Arizona.  Now Greg is trying to fix this bus up a little and just happens to
be the sort of person who likes to do things right and likes to keep his bus
original.  I realize this isn't everybody's cup of tea, but actually caring
about a job well done is almost a thing of the past these days it seems.  I
have a bus I have been looking for this same glass for for 10 years.  I also
have a bus that has 5 different types of glass, including some that is
generic and some that is cracked.  That is on a bus I am not restoring.  It
is not like Greg was asking for an NOS pair of safari windows for free, he
was asking for some hard to find, but definitely not rare, windows to
complete his bus... and was willing to pay 5 times the going rate for them.
I realize that some people were kidding with Greg and that is great (they
know Greg and Greg knows them), but I believe a lot of these people are
probably just as apt to spend the extra cash to have all of their glass
match, or have that NOS doohickey, or whatever.  You would think a guy would
be able to go to one of the biggest collections of bus people around and ask
for assistance on finding a part, willing to pay a very fair price for it,
and at least get a couple of favorable responses.   I wish Greg luck and
hope to see him in Seattle.



Richard

&gt; Ya, I'd sure miss an event because I had a couple of windows that didn't
&gt; have the logo on them!!!! DUH!
&gt;  Sometimes I'm more amazed at the people on this list everyday! Thom, keep
&gt; that non-logo glass you offered up; If I need it to get a splitty on the
&gt; road I won't care what it says, or doesn't say on it! Don't need to attend
&gt; that show very bad do you Frankie!?
