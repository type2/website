John -

While I agree with you in principle, note that Michel's email comes from a 
Canadian address, and judging by the spelling of his name, it's possible 
that Michel is bilingual, and English is not his first language.  He may 
not have even realized that his response sounded as harsh as it did.  (and 
it DID)

&gt;Secondly; your command of the english language is so uneven that your

&gt;all but incomprehensible.
&gt;
&gt;Thirdly; the fact is that the very situation you railed against has
&gt;happened.
&gt;
&gt;Above all, we treat our fellow listees with respect. I'm not the list
&gt;administrator, but I am a member in good standing and as such I feel
&gt;compelled to speak out against your language and demeanor.
&gt;
&gt;You owe all of us, and JP in particular an apology.
&gt;If you're not man enough, or literate enough to deliver one then I suggest
&gt;you keep your
&gt;opinions to yourself.
