&gt; Hey all,
&gt; 
&gt; When I bleed the brakes only the rear drivers side squirts 
&gt; with 
&gt; good pressure.  The other three wheels have a spurt of spray and 
&gt; then spit a 
&gt; little and stop.  the pedal doesn't drop more to let all air it just 
&gt; stops.  
&gt;
you may still have air trapped in the line some ware.
when you bleed the brakes adjust your wheel cylinders tight against the
drums.
set the ebrake as well.
then open all four wheel cylinder nipples 
and go watch giligans island reruns while you brakes bleed via gravity.
keep the master cly. res. toped off during commercials
after the skipper and his lil buddy have worn you out 
do a bleed the two man way, right rear first and on down, longest to
shortest line
 adjust your brakes and try a road test.
good luck
ken
