&gt;Hmmm, maybe I'll tell my wife our anniversary is in November this

Heck if you don't advertise it too well, maybe Charlie will show up? 
But then he'll start a new marriage that everyone else likes 
better...

Ok...enough of that nonsense! :) Boy, it's definitely Friday.

Seriously, though...SOTO and Dave are too easy of a target. It's not 
easy running a club with a fistful of people helping, and it'd be 
impossible to run one the size of SOTO with no help. SV2s started as 
the San Diego chapter of SOTO, but through a lack of support we 
decided it was time to branch out. Last time I spoke with Dave I had 
a great conversation with him. He's not Satan, he just got swamped. 

OCTO puts on GREAT shows, but they're not a club. I've seen a lot of 
the links to their website listed as &quot;OCTO - better than SOTO&quot;. 
Better at advertising shows? Heck yeah! But they need to stop 
comparing themselves...it makes them look petty when their party line 
seems to be &quot;no politics&quot;.

Just my opinions of course...
