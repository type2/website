&gt; Happy Friday.  I was just wondering if anyone has tryed/sampled with any
&gt; luck door seals from JC Whitney?  They have a 8 piece set to do
&gt; bothe front  doors for $40.  Just wondering if they compare at all to the
kit
&gt; Bus Depot  offers for $100 a door? As always on Friday enjoy the weekend.


They're apples and oranges. The Whitney $40 8-piece kit just does the
perimeter of the doors, that's it.  I sell them for about $10 more, but my
shipping rates are much lower than theirs (so it almost evens out anyway),
and my quality is better.  My $99-per-door kit (actually $94 after
listmember discount) does not just the perimeter of the door, but basically
every seal on the front door and windows.  That is about two dozen seals in
total (both doors), not eight.
