OK.  NOW I got the electrical back together, and the bus is acting like
the clutch cable is broken, but it's moving!  The last couple weeks, it's
been sticking first thing in the morning, I.e. starting as if I didn't
have the clutch in.  It would jerk forward, then start up fine.  That
only happened when it's been sitting a while, and even then not all the
time.  Well, I pushed the bus home with my electrical problem Friday, and
fixed that a few minutes ago.  (Fuse box melted where the hot from the
battery skips over to the light switch, the contact was broken) Now, no
matter what I do, the bus is in gear.  Adjusted the clutch to no avail. 
Wife stepped on the pedal and sure enough it's moving at the tranny. 
What now?
