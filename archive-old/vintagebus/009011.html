Subject: WTB: Front Floor section

I'm not sure if parts needed is acceptable on the list, but I really need a
front floor section for my 64 bus.
I'm not looking for the reproduction side panels by the doors (though mine
are gone). I need the WHOLE front floor.
I have nothing to bolt the shifter to, or anything like that. Does anyone
know of a source that either sells a replacement panel or a good used one?

Any help would be appreciated.

Thanks

P.S. I also need the lower hinge area on my bus if anyone has some cut out.
