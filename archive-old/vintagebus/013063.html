i recently got a m-code tag off a 59 westy (thanks jon r!) and was wondering
if anyone knew whether so-23 westy's had different &quot;options&quot; on them much like
the so-42's did (a,b and c modelled so-42')

specifically..

the m-code tag reads as such

29 12 9 (made dec 29 1959)
372 b23 168 175 181 544 (mosr codes are easy decipherable except b23 and 544)
UV 231 SK 654C 551426 (us import Sealing Wax Red and Beige Grey..)

anyway can anyone offer any light on &quot;b23&quot; was this a mid range so-23 model-
what did it come with and what did it not??

any light shed wuold be appreciated
