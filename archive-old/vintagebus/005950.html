I would agree that until we here other complaints of late then wait and see
waht Dawn has to say. I know for a fact they have been away on a family
visitation for the past week as I met Dawn on a side trip here in Canada on
the weekend. In passing she stated how she is behind since her move to
Arizona.
I always give people the benefit of the doubt before I condemn. I have been
a small business owner for the past 10 years and I know what it is like.
Let's everyone take a deep breath and let the dust settle before assuming
Dawn has disappeared. We are all friends here, right?
