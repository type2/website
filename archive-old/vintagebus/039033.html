&gt;So would a '59 Euro SC w/semaphores have blinkers or anything 
&gt;other than headlights on the nose?

No.  Should only have headlights and a pair of round tail lights in the
back.  

My 58 Euro sc has a beautiful pair of $4.95 trailer lights in the back,
right above the stock lights curtesy of a PO from the distant past.  Since
they're already there, I wired them to be extra brake lights and rear turn
blinkers (flasher relay included).  On the front, just for kicks, I stuck
some really bright orange bulbs in where the marker lights are supposed to
be in the the headlight buckets and wired them to flash with the blinkers
also.  All this because it's been converted to 12v so I don't use my
semaphores.  A little odd, but they work and for some reason, pass state
inspection that way.
