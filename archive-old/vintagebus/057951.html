Or, you take a piece of garden hose about 6-8 feet long and a funnel. 
Put small end of funnel in garden hose. Put end of garden hose in 
transmission fill hole. Fill funnel with oil. As long as funnel is above 
transmission, this works. A cheap, easy solution, especially if you have 
enough hose to be able to do this standing up beside your bus instead of 
laying beneath it.

&gt;I bought a hand suction pump at AutoZone when I changed my gear oil...
