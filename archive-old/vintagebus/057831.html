Subject: Re: [VB] '65 front wheel bearing race

This one scared me a bit when I did my bearings, until I figured it
out.  Once you punch out the smaller outboard bearing race, you will
find that you have more access to the backside of the larger inboard
race.  Once the grease is wiped away, you should find that the larger
race's backside has barely enough of a lip over the hub to give you a
foothold to start punching away cautiously.  Try a variety of punch
sizes (if you have them) until you find one that works.  Once the race
starts to come out the room to angle in a punch gradually increases.

&gt; I'm replacing the bearings on the front wheels of my '65.  There's a
&gt; race pressed into the outer side that I can remove with a punch and
&gt; hammer.  For the inner race- which is pressed into the brake drum hub,
&gt; it looks like I don't have the same kind of access to the back side.
&gt;  There's two notches, but they don't appear to be all the way through to
&gt; the inner race.  How do I remove the inner race?
