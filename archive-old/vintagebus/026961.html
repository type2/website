&gt;Does anyone know of a simple way to swap the original front seats (1/3,2/3)
for a more comfortable, more modern seat, preferably from a newish Japanese
donor vehicle. Ideally, the bus should not need any altering, only the seats.
&gt;
The only thing more comfortable than a 1/3, 2/3 seat is a original Bus bench
seat, I recommend you purchase an earlier Bus ASAP.

(with busted springs and torn upholstery, there's a deeper meaning there
I think)
