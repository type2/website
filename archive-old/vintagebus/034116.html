The only between cylinder head and barrel, shims (spacers, head gasket) are
C B's or Autocrafts, these are copper ie: head gaskets. I use these when i
build most of my none stock engines, 1776 or larger. I run 0 deck height and
use either a 40 thousand or 60 thousand head gasket, depending on the
compression ratio i'm trying to achive. On my 1776 single port and a 1840
(don't ask) engine that i built i haven't had to retorque the heads since
built, over 20,000 on each engine and no loose heads. This year will be the
true test as the show season has begone and i will be driving one of my
buses an average of 600 a road trip, every other weekend.

good luck   ronnie  old volks of az.

So..
I guess I have to start all over **SIGH***  
I'm going to use some RTV sealant on the cylinders this time, and try to get
the pushrod tubes straight.  

I'm still wondering about those shims that were in the old heads.
(circular,
metal, gasket-type things)  I didn't use any when I put it back together.  I
don't really see why I would need to, but...   Could that be part of the
problem??


Also, am I supposed to put sealant between the cylinders and heads as well??
