Oddly enough we have a suburb called Randburg(without the s) in
Johannesburg! Also SA is correct for South Africa. 

The meet was great. There were only two buses though, my doublecab and a '63
standard. On the beetle front the highlights were a '49 Hebmuller and an
immaculately restored '50 deluxe. There were around 40 cars that went on the
run and did we turn heads!

In my last post I made it sound like there are no meets here. That is not
far off the truth but I was actually referring to pure vintage meets. Most
interest in aircooled VW's here is of the road baja or slammed late model
beetle flavour. The meet and the club which will arise from it are devoted
to vintage vehicles only. 

Later
