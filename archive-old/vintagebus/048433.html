Subject: Re:Vinyl Graphics

I am a designer by trade so I do a lot of work with vinyl graphics. They
are great! Make sure and find someone who uses high quality sign grade
vinyl. This will keep it from fading and will make it easier to peel off
when that day comes. A note on remove-ability, remember that paint fades
over time. Paint fades much slower behind vinyl. If you have a vinyl
graphic on a vehicle for a few years and then take it off you will usually
notice a pretty distinct shadow of what was there. This depends on the
color of paint and the UV stability but you would be surprised how much
this can show up.

Vinyl gives you super sharp edges and no brush strokes. If that is what you
are after then it would be perfect. The sign painter look would probably be
more authentic. If I was choosing I would go vinyl for the ease and less
risk.

Hope this helps,
Craig
