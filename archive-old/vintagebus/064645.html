&gt; I noticed that on one side there was silicon or some type of sealant used 
&gt; around the wheel bearing on the end of the axle and on one side there was 
&gt; none used. Which way is recommended and if to use a sealant, does it matter 
&gt; what type?

Hi Tom,
Best to use no sealant on an outer rear wheel bearing cover.  If it turns out 
that the sealing surfaces have been scratched or damaged in some way then 
using a high temp silicon sealant will work, but only in very small amounts.  
We prefer to finger paint the sealant onto any paper gaskets if needed.
