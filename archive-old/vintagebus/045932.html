 ...and also I hear that finding replacement screws is hard.

derrick writ:
I ordered enough screws for 6 popouts sometime last
year from Wolfgang.  I think it ran me about $5.  It
is a 3.5X5mm flat head screw.  Have a nice day :)

great- I am glad they are available.   Hurray for Wolfgang.    I forget 
exactly what the deal was, but I heard that the replacement screws people had 
found had a diff size head or length or something they were not quite right.  

Do you know have many buses you have to take apart to fill a little film 
container with good used popout window screws?
