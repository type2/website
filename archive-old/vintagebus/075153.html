Subject: RE: [VB] oil change ?

Gotta remove oil by a balancing act with the plate removal..
The older style plate retrofits.
That twas stock for later stuff.

...


I went to do the oil change thing on my 58' espresso bus and noticed
something
a bit odd.  The engine is a type 1 that I believe is a '74.  There is no
drain
plug.  The plate on the bottom of the case is solid, no place for a drain
plug.  Any ideas?  Am I missing something here?  I do not see an aftermarket
oil filter or anything out of the ordinary.  Anyone, anyone...
