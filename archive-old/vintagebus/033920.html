&lt;&lt; rear end tow dolly &gt;&gt;

I just use two reduction boxes w/o axles in them.  Turn them upside down, put 
them on the other side, and stick something in the axle housings so they 
won't flex too bad and twist the plates.  You don't need oil in them just to 
pull the thing onto a trailer.  Of course, you may not have lots of 
transmission pieces laying around...
