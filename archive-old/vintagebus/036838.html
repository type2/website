&lt;&lt; For 30 degrees BTDC:  The timing mark is 43 mm to the right of TDC.  &gt;&gt;
Hi Paul,
The problem with this is two fold.  One, which size of pulley are you talking 
about?  Secondly, where is 0 degrees?  The only way to find out is to either 
feel for TDC #1 with a screwdriver with the plug out, and/or use one of those 
degree pulleys as a tool to show you where the marks on your stock pulley 
are.  For us, this blueprinting the stock pulleys is the only use for the 
aluminum degree pulleys.

PS.  Best investment in non-static timing lights is the type you can dial 
adjust.  In otherwords when you have it set for 0 degrees it flashes at this 
point on the pulley.  When set for say 30 degrees BTDC it again will flash at 
the 0 degree mark to show you that it is sparking at the 30 degree point 
without having to place marks all over the pulley.   Eric&amp;Barb
