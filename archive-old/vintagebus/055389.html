I dont think thats what they are for. You need to get
your headlights adjusted. Eyebrows are just for looks.

Mike,
     My head light adjustment is fine, thank you.  Maybe your not up on 
H-4's, they put out quite a lot more light than the sealed beams your 
running.  I guess we could say, compared to H-4's, your a little on the dim 
side.  Maybe you should consider a set.
                                                                              
    Peace,
                                                                              
       Frank
