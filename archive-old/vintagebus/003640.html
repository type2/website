nah, keep it clean cut thom! - if anything make an almostvintagebus_dot_com site
up along the same lines. even a notnearlyvintagebus_dot_com for the wedges...
maybe a what!thatsnotavintagebus_dot_com for the lts - is this going to far??

i do agree tho - its useful to have contacts with bays and such - but if you
start taking too much on you'll get the next wave complaining like the type4
engine buses, then the wedges, then the lt-whatevers.

i like your site because i know where to find...well...like vintage bus
stuff! - go figure ;)

cool with making a new site but to mix em in wont work too well.

hth

happy overdose of chocky time folks :)

&gt; I'm torn: should I allowe bay-window buses on my site?  I get a lot of
bay-window
&gt; pix uploaded, which I usually shuttle off to the &quot;bay area&quot;  Every time I
allow
&gt; the bay-window section to be indexed, I almost immediately get flack-mail
from
&gt; my fellow split-purists.  But at the same time, I get complaints that I
don't
&gt; support the bay community.  I haven't seen a vb_dot_com style site for
bay-windows -
&gt; does one exist?
