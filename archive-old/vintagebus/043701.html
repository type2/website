Subject: Torsion arm link pin adusting
Message-ID: &lt;Pine.LNX.4.10.10104290134390.18801-100000_at_birdbird.birdbirdbird_dot_com&gt;

All,

I greased the front end of my Bus (humming ClaraW's grease mantra at
times) tonight and tried to adjust the torsion arm link pins per
Muir and Bentley.  It's a '64 Standard built in November '63.

I did the bottom one on the right side first and I could really feel
&quot;the shoulder making contact&quot; - there was a definite spot where it
got harder to turn, but before it was completely tightened.  OK.

The top on on the right side didn't feel like that.  I didn't feel
anything different until right when it was at the end of its rotation.
I also noticed a difference between the top and bottom pins.  On the
bottom one, the outboard edge of the flats on the side of the pins
(for your wrench) was only about 1-2mm away from the torsion arm
end.  On the top one, the outboard edge of the flats was about 3-4mm
away from the torsion arm.  In other words, the top one stuck out
more (towards the center of the Bus) from the torsion arm end.  I
ended up backing it off a little from full tight and setting it
there.

Both pins on the left side stuck out the same amount, and this was
comparable to the bottom pin on the right side.  I still didn't
feel a nice, definite feel, but I adjusted them as best I could.

Should I have felt that same feeling all four places?  Is it
usually pretty easy to tell?  Also, does that top pin on the right
sticking out further than the other 3 indicate a problem?

Thanks!

Matt Roberds
