Subject: Re: [VB] leaking crew cab

My DC had a nearly terminal case of this disease. The leak was caused by the
seam in the bed that runs the width of the bed about a foot or so behind the
rear window. Water was coming in the seam and onto the bulkhead over the
transmission, running down onto the cargo floor under the gas tank and
running forward to the rear seat section.

My leak was so bad that it completely rusted-out the bed at the seam, the
top had that runs under the seam, the bulkhead over the transmission, and
the floor under the gas tank and rear seat. Ask me how much fun this was to
fix!

&gt; Hi List,
&gt; I was wondering if there are &quot;typical&quot; spots where
&gt; water gets into a spittie, more specifically, a crew
&gt; cab. Mine has all new weather stripping but everytime
&gt; it rains or I wash it, it gets considerable water in
&gt; the floorboard of the rear seat section.
