Subject: 63 s/c gate bumper ?s
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

Clara &amp; I are installing the gates on my 63 singlecab. We are not certain as 
to how the rubber bumpers are meant to go. It appears that the side gates 
have two bumpers on the gate with some having an extra bumper on the body 
below, by the engine vents. The rear gate seems to have bumpers on the gate, 
early buses with pressed seem to have bumpers either side of the engine hatch.

I can't find good pictures in dropgates_dot_com.

The other part of this question is what size are the bumpers, and which goes 
where?  Cause if there is a bumper on the body the the rear where the gate 
bumper meets, but not at the front, this imples that the front gate bumper is 
longer than the rear gate bumper.    

TIA for any answers.
