No answer but my comments below....

&gt; 3. Loose or bad gland nut- could be, the gland nut looked fine and I torqued it on with 1/2 my weight and a 4' cheater bar. I only weigh about 125lbs., but I thought I got it tight enough?
&gt;
1/2 your weight?  Don't know if I could guess that.  It doesn't sound too exact.

&gt;
5. Improperly torqued pp bolts- Possibly... I went round and round 1/2 turn each until the pp mated (funny) up with the flywheel. Then I gave them each a 1/4 turn more...
&gt;
This doesn't sound tight enough.  Did you have the flywheel lock still on?  I usually have to hold the flywheel with my hand to apply the proper torque wrench setting.  A torque wrench is your friend.
