&gt; I've looked at Matts write up and I've been to Stern Lighting page.  The one

&gt; understand)  But does the power wire from the #56 terminal still send power to
&gt; the lights along with the relay? and will this cause an issue when running
&gt; power to the relays for the lights.  I plan on running 3 10G wires from the
&gt; back for low beam/high beam and Hella driving lights.  I just a bit confused
&gt; on running from the dimmer switch

Matt will prolly come on here and clarify things for yah, but your new
relays will switch the current from those new 10G wires you're running
over to the lights. The Dimmer relay will choose which new relay gets
coil-power. That should get you started.
