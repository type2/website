&gt; &gt;Plus so far
&gt; &gt;we only have been able to find one non-crow foot rim dated before 1960.
&gt;This
&gt; &gt;would mean that we only can find truck or panel rims?  When more kombis,
&gt; &gt;westies, deluxes were imported to the USA?  Eric&amp;Barb
&gt;
&gt;Allen becker's old 58 standard had three original paint &quot;crows foot&quot; rims 
&gt;and
&gt;two original paint &quot;flat&quot; rims.  Date codes were all the same.
