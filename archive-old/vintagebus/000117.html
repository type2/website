 (water-cooled?) distributor cap for a correct cap &gt;&gt;
Hi Rachel,
Definitely check the rotor to new cap for proper fit.  Also while you are at 
it check the carbon brush inside the top center area of the cap.  This brush 
should not be flush with the surface inside of the cap, and it should be a 
spring fed type.  So if it is not there maybe your problem.  
  Eric's Dad had a simular situation once.  A co-worker of his asked him to 
take away an old car that suddenly no longer ran.  Dad went over checked it 
out, found no spark, and that the cap brush spring had broken, and allowed 
the brush to jam up away from the top of the rotor.  Dad having spare parts 
took out a spring/brush, and drove away in about 3 minutes.  Boy the fellow 
who gave the car away was mad!   Eric&amp;Barb
