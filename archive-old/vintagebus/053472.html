Yes, striped left battery tray.
Single position hatches werent carried through all wolfsburg busses, only
through about December of 1955.
Early doglegs with n drain holes and the brazilian style nasty seams. I need
these if anyones got extra.
Bakalite domelights changed about Sept. of 55 or so.
Gas door seal carried through pretty far, my sept 56 standard has it.
Dont forget about the vent latches, the front bumper (they had some
transitions here too, 55-56 having no threaded inserts but having holes for
the license plate), cab doors with the 55 pressing, slightly different than
57-
Cab floor mat is also different for 55's, 56- having an extra notch to clear
the seam roll on the heater duct.
Popout windows are also different with the frame halves having plates
rivited on rather than spot welded.
Yep, the decklids were chopped down from singlecab belly doors.
They had three styles of the lip over the front windshields, early one being
completly flat with the grates, second not having a lip around the grates
but having late pressings on the sides, and finally the late style most
people have.
Also i believe the latch for the gas door flips the oppisite direction as
the later busses...maybe thats nonsense.
Headlight glass is about a one year only thing....
I heard something about turn signal lenses being shorter but never seen one.
The entire cargo floor has a different pressing than hanover busses.
I won't even start with the engine details....but there are a ton.
I'm rambling....see some of you at pomona.
Regards,
Greg Noble

&gt;Derek,
&gt;
&gt;I have a 56 also, made in mid Feb. of 1956.  One of the last Wolfsburg 
&gt;busses.  It has some of the features of the &quot;transition&quot; busses.  It has an 
&gt;engine compartment lid that has been repressed from a drop gate.  You can 
&gt;tell by looking at the underside and seeing if it has a notch in the seam 
&gt;around the inside lip on each side.  Mine also has the funky seal around the 
&gt;gas fill door and the curved front transaxle mount.  I am not an expert on 
&gt;this, but I have heard that the first Hanover busses have a striped left 
&gt;battery tray (sometimes a round impression also).  My battery is right side.  
&gt;Also I have heard that the Hanover's had a single position rear hatch (mine 
&gt;has 2 positions).  I also believe that the &quot;transition busses&quot; have a 
&gt;different type of interior lights.  Mine also has the funky dog legs and they 
&gt;switched styles when they went to Hanover.  My PO told me that there was an 
&gt;excellent article written on these busses in either VW Trends or Hot VW's 
&gt;around '97 or '98 which explains all the differences.  He was not sure which 
&gt;publication as he subscribes to both.  I have been looking for the article 
&gt;casually, but should exert more effort.  If I run across it I will let you 
&gt;know.
