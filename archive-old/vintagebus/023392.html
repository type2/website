&lt;&lt; Anyway it takes a long time for the bus to return to idle after it has 
been reved to
a higher rpm.  I put on the idle cam spring off the 30/31 which was stiffer 
but didn't
notice any improvement. Muir said the 32 pict (i believe) ran in the early 
70s took 3 seconds to return to idle. &gt;&gt;
Hi Erik,
You might just need to oil the throttle shafts with engine oil to loosen 
things up.  If it has the 1968-71 Throttle Valve Positioner you need to look 
at you copy of or go out and buy the Bentley Official Service Manual for 
post-1967 buses in the fuel section for adjustments to the Throttle Valve 
Positioner.  You can adjust the delay time down to a second or two.  The 
purpose of this devise is to prevent the throttle from slamming shut when you 
take your foot off the gas pedal when the engine is doing high RPMs which 
causes it to suddenly suck a huge amount of fuel into itself causing less MPG 
and more pollution.  Eric&amp;Barb
