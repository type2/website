I've decided that I don't want to get the '57
I just looked at it, so here's the scoop on
it for the rest of you.

Chassis 301 806 or thereabouts which puts it
in late '57, and CO says it's registered as a '58.
All indications it is indeed a '58.  It turns out to be a
'58 Kombi with 6 pop-outs and safari's, bench seat.

Bad stuff first:
Rocker rust under cargo doors, through.  Phone
conversation indicated dog legs, they're fine, except,
small hole (bullet?) on right dog leg, rusting.
Rust on roof where roof rack attached, not through,
but seriously bubbling.
Safari's rusted all over.  CO silicone sealed them
for the winter, now unsealed.
Some previous patch and paint on RR corner, PPO.
A little separation of front skin from lower front body
visible from underneath.
Some minor dents, scratches, and dings all over.
Missing rear hatch handle.
Engine/starter in it not sell with bus, engine to go with it
not running well, probably internal, needs engine.
Passenger mirror cut-off.
Funky rear view mirror.
No headliner.
Rear brake/tail light glass broken.
License plate light missing glass.
Rear apron pushed around a little, not bad.
Front window broken.
A couple window seals (pop-out) missing,
remaining need replacement, probably original.
Passenger door siliconed shut due to lack of
working opening mechanism.

Good stuff:
Original Dove blue paint in decent shape, white roof.
No rust underneath except surface, no bubbles at all.
Has crank style apron.
15 inch wheels with proper hubcaps.
Interior front door panels cheap wood.
Front area panels original style and in good shape, hard
to believe they're original though, probably not with leaky safari's.
Safari's missing 3 of 4 latches.
One pop out latch broken and missing, another missing at frame.
Remaining 4 short spoon type, correct for Kombi.
Bullet front turn signals, white. (euro bus?)
No adapters for wipers and they don't work, duck missing.
Steering wheel cracked in several places.
Engine/starter to go with it is 1600DP, Solex 30, oil bath, 6V.
No interior in rear (may have come that way)
Rear seats not original but correct style (s/b black are not)
All seats in good shape, dirty but not cut.
Driver mirror original style.
Full length all metal roof rack.
Blaupunkt AM radio, not hooked up, but CO says works.
Dash not whacked up at all.
Has ribbed bumpers in fairly good shape.
Drove well, minimal steering play, trans not pop out.
New tires and front bearings, front brakes good.


Other stuff, good or bad depends on your perspective.
Bus Boys adjustable front end, stock to real low.
IRS tranny rear end, indeterminate lowering technique,
but no welding/cut visible, CO says it's a Bus Boys adjustable.
12 volt conversion.
Personalized CA plate &quot;LOWERD 57&quot;

If it wasn't for the need for rust repair SOON, I'd get it.

This would be a fairly easy restoration, or fix up for
someone willing to tackle the rust, I'm not.  Could be
driven as is (with motor), but rust will get real bad soon
if not taken care of.

Oh yeah, the who, where, how much, I almost forgot.
Vacaville CA, Sal at, well, here's the ad.  Been running
a week already, still not sold.

BUS '57, mostly orig., looks great, nds some work
     $2600.  707-448-4750

Going off to school, keeping Ghia and good engine,
is why he's selling it.

Jeff
