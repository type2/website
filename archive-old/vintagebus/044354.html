Subject: oil pressure guage question

I've got an old oil pressure guage sitting here with a small amount 
of metal tubing, and a fitting for the oil pressure switch area on 
the engine. The guy used this to test oil pressure on engines in the 
engine compartment.

Got me thinking though. Are all oil pressure guages like this? Does 
the pressure go right into the guage? Or do they have some other kind 
of sender that just sends electrical reading the guage? If not, you'd 
have to run a lot of tubing from the engine to the front of the bus 
where the guage would be...wouldn't you. Seems like a long way to go.

Just curious really.
