  Hmmm, I didn't see your original post. 
  Anyway, I have never tried the soldering iron trick, I 
don't know if it would stand up to your application. We 
aren't talking 1 lonely battery here!
  Similar battery boxes that we have made for PG&amp;E 1/4&quot; 
thick material on the bottom and 1/2&quot; for the sides. 
That's a lot of area to heat. I should have some scrap 
PP if you want to give it a try. If that doesn't work, 
we can put one together with the extrusion welder...take 
about 3 hours for a 5'x3' box.
  Contact me off list if you need some more help on this.

BTW- when are you going to convert that 21 window of 
yours to electric?!? then again, I wouldn't wan't an 
electric car when were having sky high prices and 
rolling blackouts! How about a wood burner like the 
kubelwagen? Or forget the battery tray and soon it could 
be &quot;Flintstone&quot; powered!

ok, ok back to work now :(

Good luck

&lt;&lt; Any listees know how to weld polypropylene plastic? 
Todd? Pam? I need battery boxes for my electric Thing 
before too many holes appear.  &gt;&gt;

Hi Harry,
We just use an old fashioned high wattage electric 
soldering iron!  Just cut 
the box/es to remove the excess length and use the hot 
iron to weld the 
pieces back together.  The excess remains are helpfull 
as filler material to 
be ironed into place.    Eric&amp;Barb
