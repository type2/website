Yes, I have gotten a ticket for having open safaris in Miami, FL.  I had to 
take a photo to court showing them in a closed position and i told them that 
they were &quot;permanently like that now&quot;.  They dismissed it with a $10 fee.

Hello all,

I was wondering how many of you out there drive with your safari's open and
have had run-ins with the law about it.  I'm in the SoCal area and I asked a
CHP officer the other day about it and he said that it was illegal to drive
with them open and that if they saw me doing it, they'd ticket me.  So I was
curious if anyone has ever recieved a ticket for an open safari.

Thanks,

Alex
