&lt;&lt; I've got a question, is the fuel petcock different on a single cab then a
 regular bus?? these would be the one with the reserve lever on them. I have
 a bunch of new (not NOS) fuel petcocks and when I went to install one on my
 side loader the lever would be in the wrong position. The cable would have
 to be pulled out for the on position and pushed in for the reserve. I have
 installed these on buses without a problem and checked all the OG ones I
 have and they were all the same. None of my other single cabs have these on
 them (all replaced by PO's), so I have nothing to compare to.
 
 TIA  ronnie &gt;&gt;

according to parts list, the post bd truck takes the same fuel tap as any 
other post bd bus,
