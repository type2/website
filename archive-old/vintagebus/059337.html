Hello All   I have been using one of the old southwinds in the &quot;Ghoost&quot; 
mounted under the middle seat with the exhust going under the front wheel 
well now for 12 years. I hooked a dryer hose to it so I could point it 
whereever I wanted.Turned the old bus into a true 12 month vehicle. Going 
skiing was great ,would stick the hose into the ski boots, toasty warm. Made 
running creeks in the winter a whole lot better. I have also seen these 
mounted under the front tray.  Later Mark Dearing  Salem Import Service Salem
