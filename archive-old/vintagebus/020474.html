Agreed, Just giving Lenny props for importing the
stuff instead of sticking to the one-trick-pony
concept. Oh my Gawd, creative open mined thinking in
the VW scene! Unheard of!!!! ;-)
Not an insider advertising conspiracy. Have met Lenny
all of like, two or three times and has always been a
gentleman to me. Personally, I have a hard time towing
my butt behind me anymore much less stepping up to buy
but encourage qualified individuals to go sniff.
Happy 4th to all...

&gt; That one is cool, but the small 50 something Westy
&gt; trailer is really amazing.  That thing still has
original EVERYTHING even down to the small souvenir
pennants still stuck to the walls by the original
owner.
