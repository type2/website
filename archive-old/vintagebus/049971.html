Bentley says 90W in normal climates, 80W in artic climates, and to drain
the oil and replace with anti-corrosive oil during extended storage to
prevent damage to syncros.



Interesting that even well before the days of GL5, the VW engineers were
worried about the corrosive properties of hypoid oils.
