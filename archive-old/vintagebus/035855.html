Subject: tranny stuck in reverse
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

Hi everyone,
Does anyone have an idea how to get a tranny unstuck from reverse?
I was coasting out of my driveway the other day and I popped it into reverse. 
Now it won't come out.

I need to get my bus on the road asap, so if anyone has a good idea, please 
let me know.

Thanks in advance,
Dave Barnes
