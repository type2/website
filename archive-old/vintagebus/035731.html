&lt;&lt; This is my first winter with my bus. I live in IN. Twice now I have blown 
the gasket out of my oil filter in the bitter cold because the oil froze in 
the filter and blocked flow. I have a full flow system. I know the only way 
to get the water out is to change the oil or get the oil temp up past 220F  &gt;&gt;

Hi Scott,
Make sure the make of oil filter you are using have a relief valve.  We used 
to use Fram filters and had two blow up due to no relief valve during cold 
weather at only about the freezing temps (32F).  The WIX filter with thier 
relief valves have been no problem in temps as low as -6F.
Aslso install the thermostatic bellows and flaps in your engine tin.  You 
just need to get the engine oil temp over 160F and make sure your breather 
hose from the oil filler to the air cleaner is in place and not clogged to 
boil off the water vapor out of the oil.  We have been runing full flow 
filters on our engine for several years without problems.  Eric&amp;Barb
