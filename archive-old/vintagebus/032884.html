Is it uncommon to have a walk-through 8-seater?  Were they
usually all 7-seaters to walk from front to back?
-  -- -
yes, it is uncommon.  I thought I saw an mcode for a walkthrough with full
width seat (and for a bench seat with 2/3 middle seat) but can't find them.

usually 7 seaters of 9 seaters
