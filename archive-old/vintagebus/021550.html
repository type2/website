&lt;&lt; Geez, you got an answer to all of my problems!   I will try soap
 tonight.   Thanks&gt;&gt;
Hi Jeff,
Just try applying the soap with little water, or if you use dishwashing soap
of a good brand apply it without water.  After the 15 minutes (5 minutes will
work not as well, but do not let the soap dry!) apply brush and a little
water with elbow grease.  The trick about most degreasers is that it likes to
bond with grease, then when water is applied the degreaser likes the water
even more and it takes the grease with it as it gets rinses away.  So if you
apply water first to heavily greased parts and then the degreaser the
degreaser likes the water more so it does not bother the grease much.
Leaving you with a big mess left over.  If you could get your VW to a wash
rack (The auto wash place where you do the spray cleaning, not the ones that
you just sit in your car.) and they have good engine degreaser.  You just
spray thier engine degreaser on and either wait five minutes or degreaser
some other part of your VW while the area sits.  Then after these areas have
sat for five minutes each you go back and use the high pressure spray.  Works
wonders with little elbow grease.

 &lt;&lt;I'm about to put the 73 brake master cylinder on my 61 as you suggested.
I didn't want to keep bothering you with this subject but since I have
you.... Is there any concerns about not having vacume assistance like later
model buses?   &gt;&gt;
The only problem with this setup is that there is no dust cover over the
later MC, but if you use your belly pan most of the dust, dirt, mud problem
will be solved.  You could also make your own dust cover out of vinyl or
inner tube rubber hand sewn and water hose clamped to the later MC.  Just
make sure to make a small drain hole in it like the earlier dust covers.
