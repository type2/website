Subject: RE: [VB] Air compressor and water


I did some reading on this and one solution I saw was a &quot;sine wave&quot; shaped 
output line from the compressor if you can visualize that. Essentially a 
series of traps, 6 in the one I saw, fixed to a small section of wall next 
to the compressor each with a tap at the low point as mentioned in the post 
below.  I understand heating the air after this section also helps perhaps 
by heating the final section of air line, as in heat tape (NE guys should 
know this one), which will help in avoiding condensation when it exits the 
line and expands, hence a temperature drop in air temp which can precipitate 
water.

&gt;I have a friend that double-trapped his line, but he had a pretty
&gt;extensive network of piping in his shop and they were spaced out quite a
&gt;bit. I agree that a trap upstream of the tank would be pretty hard on
&gt;the motor. Maybe running them a few feet apart might help? Does your
&gt;tank have a spigot at the bottom of it? I used to open that and let the
&gt;water come out (stand back) before starting a project or when the
&gt;compressor had not run for a while.
&gt;
&gt;Hope that helps...

&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Hi all,
&gt;
&gt;While a bit off topic it does relate to my bus in that I need to finish
&gt;putting my roof on.  What does every body do to keep the water out of
&gt;the tank?  I have a water trap, after the tank before the hose, but am
&gt;wondering if should put in another before the tank (or is that too
&gt;constricting, making the motor work to hard).  I remember somebody on
&gt;the list (Scott Fraser Maybe???) who went to great lengths to make sure
&gt;the air coming out of the system had virtually no water.
&gt;
&gt;It should be mentioned that I live in San Diego and it is a generally
&gt;moist climate.  Any ideas would be great.
&gt;
&gt;Thanks,
&gt;Aaron
