Subject: [VB] bee hive lights?
Message-ID: &lt;19991123193113.58692.qmail_at_hotmail_dot_com&gt;

i was curious about some reverse lights i had on my ex-64 micro(kombi?)
these lights were of a good quality, with glass lenses and chrome rings. if 
i remember correctly they were hella. the glass was clear and resembled a 
bee hive in shape. they were mounted directly above the taillights. i had to 
rewire them to a switch mounted low behind your right leg as you drove. I 
did one time see another bus a red and white also micro with these lights, 
but no others. were these a common upgrade? i loved them except i would 
regularly forget to turn em' off, even with a lighted switch.
