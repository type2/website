All,
	I like George's theory on how air scoops might actually restrict air to
the engine!  I've had a pair on my '67 for 15 years and I feel that they
actually improve cooling and performance.  Twice during desert back road
adventures the scoops  have gotten knocked off the sides of the bus by
trees along the narrow trail.  I found that the bus ran hotter and the
fuel economy went down on the hyway sans scoops.  I also find that when
running the bus into strong head winds, something that can make your bus
run extremely hot, that the engine runs almost too cool with scoops.  I
agree with Bob Hoover that the scoops do collect alot of crud and
probably force more dirt into the engine compartment.  Though, after
recently tearing down a &quot;scooped&quot; engine, I found that the cooling
surfaces were clean.  
	I would not put scoops on our pretty '66 Kiwi Bus.  They are not
pretty.  I'll keep them on the '67 beater.  They are the cheap molded
plastic ones which I fiberglassed in order to give them some useful
strength!   Gary Gibson  Tucson, Arizona
