Subject: Re: [VB] RE:Splitwindow main heat tube

  I have found that stove pipe (you know like for a pot belly stove) is a great replacement. Almost the correct diameter, 
double wall and insulated, galvinized so it won't rust, but not CHEAP, I needed to buy 2 sections and it was aprox. 22 dollars 
per section.

&gt;Don't know if this will help with regard to the heat tube issue on
&gt;splittys. Clara's probably got the best idea. Getting one from a &quot;dead&quot;
&gt;bus if possible. Just wanted to pass along replacement heat tubes are
&gt;available thru  &quot;The Bus Boys&quot; in Redding, CA. The part number is
&gt;210 255 01  Their asking $32.45 for it.
