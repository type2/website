And you guys feel an allegiance for Volkswagen! hahahahahaha. keep buying 
there products, and they will never go out of business. Why do so many people 
feel it is just as good to drive a new vw when they aren't driving there old 
one????? I dont care what kinda new car you got, whats the old one? And Thom 
shoudl copyright vintagebus first.

&lt;&lt; Look beyond the words, VWoA is out on the prowl, what they just asked for
 was you to give out VW based web sites for them to jump on. VWoA has been
 out on the heavy prowl the last few weeks, going to VW parts sellers and
 manufacturers confiscating any and all non authorized goods, threatening law
 suits, issuing cist and desist orders. It's time to stand up for our rights
 as Vintage VW owners. There are many people making parts for Vw's and VWoA
 seems to want to crunch them all. Withhold the web sites with pics, send
 them pics but don't guide them to the sites. Next they will be trying to
 shut down VW Planet and them go after Thom because they will copyright the
 name Vintagebus!!! &gt;&gt;
