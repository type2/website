Subject: Westy Value??

Hi folks, glad to see the list is up and running.  I hope no minds all the
question I ask.  Here's another; After posting last week for someone to look
at my page and give me an opinion of one in Virginia I got to thinking.
What is the average value of a 67 or 66 Westy.  I'm going this weekend to
look at one again for $1800, the guy originally started at $3800 (yea Chris,
the one in Greensboro).  It needs, Outriggers, Jackpoints, Inner and Outer
Rockers, and work on the Cargo floor.  Not to mention Body work on the
Corners and nose.  It has a strong 1600, Gas Heater, new tires and new
brakes.  I bought some Camper Interior for my Panel today including Sundial
style Windows, Icebox and Jump seat.  That may become my Camper.  Anyone
know of a Westy roof section I can buy in the NC area?

Dave
