Subject: RE: [VB] Re: [SPAM]  [VB] Gas Tank Problem

I saw a 71 SC two weeks ago that travels back and forth to Montana and
his treasure chest had a 25 gal Buick tank mounted in it. Have no idea
how he filled it and if it was the only tank or spliced in with the
stock tank. Just stood back and shook my head over the loss of storage!

Bernoulli Interval: Do I really have enough data to draw a valid
conclusion ?

&gt; I have a 61 Panel with nonstock tank, I'm not sure from what, but it
&gt; holds more than 10 gallons. The filler neck looks kind of messed up,
&gt; like a
locking
&gt; cap has been pryed off.
