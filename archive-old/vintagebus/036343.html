Has any one ever heard of the lower &quot;mountain gears&quot; that were optional in the splits for the reduction boxes? They would be really cool for an offroad bus...                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Blane '66 Bus, '60 Truck, '71 (well it is a Westy, though)....
