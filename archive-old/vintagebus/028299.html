Dave...

    I'm sorry to hear that your engine was overheating... this is never a good
thing, except for the raw experience of a bad situation and the lessons learned,
which have value in themselves.
    I regret that your partial teardown and rebuild didn't happen a little more
slowly... If it had, I would have tried to explain that a 6.8:1 compression
ratio was not the source of your excess heat.
    I try to keep my bus engines close to 6.6:1, BTW, but that is a
preference...
    Low-compression engines will have noticeably less power than engines where
CR is not a concern (i.e. higher...)...  but they also last and last and last,
and they run much cooler than higher-compression engines.
    If they do *not* run cooler, then there was undeniably a mistake in building
or tuning. But then... that's a learning experience too. BTDT, for my own part.
and... I'm still learning. :)
    I read your post about the Weber &quot;expert&quot; who told you that the low CR was
the cause of your excess heat... knowing the incorrectness of that statement, I
set about gathering some more information. After all, I do not claim to be an
expert myself, and prefer to have something to support what I say.
    I want also to validate what I believe.... somewhere on the List I read a
few times that 6.6:1 CR was the nirvana to have... the low compression ratio to
seek. Whoever wrote that must have made sense to me, because that is what I
generally adhere to when I build.... It was probably Bob Hoover, IIRC...
    But... *why* 6.6:1? or any similarly low compression ratio for that matter?
    That was the question I delivered to Bob Hoover... who replied with this:

&lt;&lt; Was it a VW TSB? or just something that you found in
 your experience over the years to be the best ratio? &gt;&gt; *(note: 6.6:1 CR, that
is...)*

Pemex 'Extra' (ie, Mexican 'regular') ranges from 70(!) to 83 octane.  Magna
Sin (Pemex's version of high octane fuel) ranges from 87 to 90.  If you drive
in Mexico I've found it best to emulate their engines.  Stock VW engine from
the Puebla plant, intended for domestic use, has a CR of 6:1.  Export engines
run about 6.6:1.  (The difference is a deeply dished piston used on the
domestic engines.)

As to building your own, for the a bus it's best to keep the CR fairly low,
with 7:1 being about as high as you'd want to go.  The problem here is
detonation due to overheating which in turn is caused by pushing a heavily
laden bus a bit too hard.

I ran 8.5:1 on my 2180 in the bus and it survived 80,000 miles before eating
one of Berg's swivel-foot adjusting screws.  No real problems.  Towed a boat
down to Baja several times, drove where I wanted to and when, but not always
as fast as I wanted to or could.  High ambient temps (ie, over 100 F.) often
saw me puttering along at 45mph, unable to do more without shoving the oil
temp right off the gauge.  Ditto for long grades.  I could have pulled them
in fourth at 70mph but I would have eaten something.  With the gearing that I
have that often meant roaring along in 3rd simply to keep my revs up so the
engine could cool itself.

Bottom line:  A lower CR would have been a smarter move.

One of my replicar customer had reams of print-outs saying the optimum CR for
his 2074cc engine should be 6.8:1 so that's what I built him, even to doing
some video showing me clocking the deck height and cc'ing the chambers.

The thing is, VW heads haven't grown any new fins.  1300cc engine could be
run flat out all day in most temperatures.  But by the time they'd bored it
out to 85.5 and jacked up the CR overheating had become a fairly constant
problem with veedubs in some parts of the country.

Type IV heads have a lot more fin area than the Type I.

    I figured that it might be a good idea to post a Treatise On Low
Compression, in light of several recent postings seemingly casting Low
Compression in a bad light... so I asked permission to quote him on a few
things. Bob responded with this e-mail:

*****************************************************************

I don't mind.  Quote away :-) (including this if you wish).  But I don't
consider myself an expert.

In trying to understand how to cool a VW engine I started out by establishing
some baselines, Volkswagen being a bit coy about answering questions on the
subject.  To get those baseline figures eventually lead to a considerable
array of temperature measuring devices, from exhaust gas temp to sampling
inlet vs outlet temps of the generator.  One of the initial problems you run
into when you do this sort of thing is calibrating your instrumentation.  It
would be a waste of time if you did not have confidence in the figures your
instruments were producing.  And if you're not into metrology this isn't the
place to start :-) (I'm reasonably competent to do this sort of thing, with a
background in electronics and having worked for Bechtel's nuclear power
division as an instrumentation engineer.)

Once I had the baseline figures I had to figure out what Volkswagen did to
produce that particular heat-distribution.  Although there were some other
experiments along the way one of the most useful tools I devised was to
replace the forward (FRONT is FRONT) panel of a blower housing with a sheet
of plexiglas and to use a smoke wand to see what was going on.  This is a lot
more trouble than it appears since you must rig some means of SUCKING the air
rather than BLOWING it.

With a set of baseline temps and a fairly good understanding of what the VW
engine designers had done to achieve those temps, I was then able to play
'What if...'

My goal was to discover a means of cooling a VW engine when installed in an
airplane, which is a completely different case than with cars and which
causes certain people to assume what I learned does not apply to cooling big
VW engines in vehicles.  Indeed, my figures were wildly at odds with those
from various VW after-market retailers such as Gene Berg.  I was never able
to reproduce the figures he cited and he was never willing to explain how he
obtained his figures.  So go figure :-)

But my results did agree quite closely to figures obtained from other
air-cooled engine sources including Corvair, Wisconsin and Franklyn.

A point worth mentioning here is that my major concern was DURABILITY.
People who build engines for the drag strip operate on an entirely different
plain of reality than people who build engines they can fly behind.

The cooling experiments were done over about a five year span starting in the
late 1960's.  I'm currently back into that aspect of engine development,
conducting some experiments with thermal barrier coatings.

*****************************************************************

    So now then.... where to go from here?
    For the immediate time, I'd make it a practice to be shifty-eyed... frequent
checks of the oil temperature gauge are mandatory, IMHO...
    you may have to slow down or drop a gear or something to keep the engine
from being damaged...
    Diagnostics....  I would recommend taking your bus to a place with an
exhaust gas analyzer... the chassis dyno and analyzer combo is the best, IMHO...
but nowadays they have analyzers that rest on the tech's lap as you drive
around... compact. It's real-time, under-load info that will help you tune the
bus accurately, and avoid those too-lean or over-rich conditions that shorten
your engine's life.
    You could also install an Air/Fuel gauge... use a three-wire oxygen sensor,
since it has the internal heater to keep the sensor warm and functioning
properly. Mounted in the collector area of an extractor exhaust, an oxygen
sensor will tend to get &quot;cold&quot; (relatively speaking) at times and give erratic
readings... it must be good and hot to work properly.

I hope this has helped.... and good luck with the engine :)
