It's painfully obvious. On my list, only two are currently operable. The 59
singlecab is my daily driver, The Westfailure is symbolic of Western
democracy's excesses, and the other ones are hers. Someday baby, I'm going
to fix them up real nice and teach you how to drive a stick, really I will.
She doesn't really ask very often when I'm going to fix her oval or her bus,
and the 57 us just to pathetic to ask about....

Nice and fair. Two for me, two for you. Never mind that roached truck over
there.
