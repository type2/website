Happy Canada Day listees!(july 1st - Canada's birthday)
Can anyone help me? I was at the classic in Irvine last month and saw a 
booth  for a company in California that does a beaut job of restoring 
steering wheels, and for a decent price too. I had picked up their card but 
now that I'm back home I can't find it. If you can get me some info on that 
company or any other that does a good job of steering wheels, that would be 
appreciated.
