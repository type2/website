Subject: Re: [VB] S0-23 Questions - buy or not?

Michael, Thom and Curt, thanks for your quick replys. 
Allow me the liberty of addressing all your questions
in one mail, hopefully that's cool.  

&gt;Driveability or show? 

Definately not show.  Mainly just a garage ornament to
do some summer camping in.  Also something to slowly
work on, perhaps someday I'd show it - who knows.  But
the truth be known, I've been looking for over 10
years to find the right splitty, and I've got a Bay
and a Vanagon in the garage to show for it... 
(Perhaps I'm too picky, I'm definately too cheap,
these are not a good combo results-wise in the land of
rust.... :-)

&gt;A 1982 westy is a considerably different beast than a
&gt;60. 

I hear ya, the speed would be about a toss-up though!
:-)

&gt;Does the person have any of the &quot;before&quot; pics of the
&gt;bus.

Unfortunately, no.

&gt;Got pix?

No current pix of the bus either...  I didn't go very
well prepared.  Recently moved, still don't know where
the digital camera is anyway....

&gt;If you relf-restore you'll be that much into it
&gt;anyway.

That's what I want to avoid.  I've seen the vintage
warehouse bus on the samba, but I guess I've got my
fill from doing my own work in the past.  I enjoy
working on stuff, but I'd rather just do upkeep and
maintenance and avoid restorations altogether.  Partly
b/c of money - it seems cheaper in the long run to buy
someone else's project after they've finished it - but
also (moreso?) b/c of time.  I'd rather be camping
anymore to tell you the truth.
