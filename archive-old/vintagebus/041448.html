&gt; Quick question:
&gt; I am getting 205/70R15 from a tire place to put on my '67 deluxe just to move it from point A to point B to do more work. This should work, right?
&gt; I will probably trailer it, so it really shouldn't matter, right?
&gt; The first 10 respondants will earn my enduring respect and thanks!

I run 215r15 on mine.  The front jackpoints can get in the way in a tight
turn, but other than that you should have no problem.  Prrobably won' even
have that trouble with 205/70s.
