Subject: Berg dipstick vs guages
References: &lt;200006160352.UAA99862_at_lenti.type2_dot_com&gt;

I wish those Berg guys would lay off of guages. I ran a Berg dipstick and an Autometer guage
at the same time and they both read virtually the same temp. Same with the VDO I had on the
motor before. I don't like having the oil pressure light going off so if I were to keep
running the Berg dipstick I would run it to a different light somewhere. I really like having
the guages and constantly scan them so I don't even use the Berg set up anymore.
