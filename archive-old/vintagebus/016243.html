The &quot;sub floor&quot; was used on double-door and sunroof buses to help
stiffen the chassis.  It consists of 3 large sheetmetal plates welded under
the bus between the center frame sections, and betweeen each frame section
and the inner rockers.

&gt; I learned a new thing while reading the posts about the slide out step:  I
&gt; don't know what a subfloor or belly pan on a bus is.  Regular, I've
&gt; got....did they lower the floor in some buses?  As far as belly pan
&gt; goes....my imaginings look like the regular cargo floor, with insulation
&gt; underneath, and then a panel to protect the insulation.  I think that sounds
&gt; like a good idea..
