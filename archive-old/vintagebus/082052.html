Subject: BRake spring help still needed

Don't want to be a pest, but I still cannot figure the brake pedal return spring out. I feel like Goldilocks, either the porrage is too hot (too much tension) or too cold (not enough tension). I need to find one that's just right. If anyone out there in Busland who has a Bus, without the splash pan and an intact brake pedal return spring could be good enough to take a minute to poke their head underneath and tell me where the flat end of the spring rest and where the hook is located on the pedal arm I would be one happy camper.

Thanks,

--Dan
