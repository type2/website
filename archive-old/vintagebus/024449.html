Subject: Re Windsheild Washer Bottle!

Hello

    This is my first post here but I have been reading alot of the mail
on this list and it has
been really helpful. I purchased a 67 Deluxe bus about 9 months ago and
have been gathering
parts to put it back together. This weekend I found in a junkyard a
windshield washer bottle
but the button on top is cracked beyond repair does any one know where I
can find a replacement
cap for it. Any information would be appreciated!


                                Thank You
                                    Eric Lykens
                                67 Deluxe Bus!
