My core is in the model shop this week. Scheduled to be finished by
Friday. Expect to make mold next week. First article the following
week.

I took apart your horn buttons. Did you want one black and the other
white?

&gt; My hat off to SV2'S for putting on a fantastic show and swap, great
people,
&gt; great food, great vehicles and best of all the LOCATION, could this
be the
&gt; Kelly Park of the Southern Cal. region? This is a must do show and
will
&gt; always be on my agenda for a nice laid back show in an absolutely
beautiful
&gt; setting.
&gt;
&gt; JP from New Mexico hooked up with me in Havasu and off we went
Friday at 1
&gt; PM., 110 heat and horrific humidity, but that didn't stop us, we
cruised at
&gt; 60 to 68 MPH, going 70 for short stretches, no heating problems, JP
got hot
&gt; a couple of times, so we slowed 5 mph for a couple of miles then
picked up
&gt; to speed again, great person to cruise with as he's not afraid to
drive his
&gt; 59 Westy with a 1600 at speed and JP is one of the most traveled bus
people
&gt; I know, 1000's of miles all the time.
&gt;
&gt; After Familianfest JP and I parted ways, he had family stuff in L.A.
and I
&gt; was off to Pomona, Pomona is or has been a bomb the last few, great
for
&gt; buyers though as there are a lot of open swap spaces. Best thing
that
&gt; happened was I bought a set of OG Safaris from Greg Noble, after JP
talked
&gt; about leaving his cracked open a little in the heat and letting the
breeze
&gt; come in, I was sold, so hope to have installed by Jerome in the DD
(metal
&gt; wiz, got any nut plates).
&gt;
&gt; The cruise home was uneventful, did 300 miles in 4 1/2 hours, which
put my
&gt; average speed a little over 60, gota love the 15 gallon bay tank,
filled up
&gt; in somewhere by Pomona and made it home on a tank, around 275 miles.
&gt;
&gt; I'm tired, 2 shows in 2 days wears you out, along with the 700 plus
miles I
&gt; drove.
