Subject: Re: [VB] One is never enough

See if it is stock 6 volt system or if it has been converted to 12 volts.  If it is a 12 volt system, then many of the electrical items will have to come from a 67 because 66 was the last year for 6 volt and 68 saw bigger changes all around (alot of 1 year only electricals in a 67).  I had a 66 that was converted to 12 volts and this made things such as wiper motors, turn signal switches, flasher relays, etc. very hard to find because they were one year only.
FWIW
Peace, John Baker

Seeking the knowledge of the Vintagebus list for the first time after many
helpful posts from the type2 list (currently drive a '72 Bay).  I am looking
into the possibility of buying a '66 Splitty with a partial Sundial camper
interior.  Before I get myself in any more trouble than absolutely
necessary, is there anything specific in the way of &quot;one year only&quot; parts or
other idiosyncracies that I should be on the lookout for in a '66 (outside
of the obvious quirks of a 36 year old bus)?  I have been researching split
windows for about a year mostly through lurking on the vintagebus list and
checking out Thom's site.  Looks like I have finally found what appears to
be a solid and fairly presentable bus about 100 miles away (not bad for a
splitty in the Northeast!)  The seller assures me that the brakes, front
suspension and steering are all in great shape, so I am already getting
pretty excited, and will probably make the trip to check it out later this
week.   I do plan to do a checkup per the John Muir method (okay, maybe no
lotus position), but seek the insight of others as well.   Anything weird
with the '66, or is it a relatively easy year to provide for?  Thanks in
advance for your help, hope to be a fellow split owner soon.
