Hi H. Steven,
Well from our parts &quot;Exchange catalog&quot; (Recycling parts to be rebuilt!) book 
what you have is correct for the 1500cc M216 engine that was standard for the 
USA from 1964-67.  It should have a &quot;VW 3&quot; stamped on one of the sides of the 
lower half of the pump body.  This threaded inlet pump went though at least 
three versions.  Most likely the reason why Wolfburg has the info wrong is 
because they are referring more about the type one than the type 2.
   Make sure to put enough grease in the base of the fuel pump to cover the 
spring/lever arm well to keep them lubed and moisture from the engine from 
attacking them.  But do not fill the area under the the diaphram so full as 
to restrict the diaphrams movement at high speeds.  Also clean and reuse the 
filter screen.  If torn/broken then it is time to get parts pumps to 
cannabilize or find a NOS fuel pump rebuild kit.
    Lastly if you get the wolfburg rebuild kit check out the thickness of the 
diaphram material compared to the old.  We have taken modern Brazialian pumps 
apart and the modern diaphram material is literally about thin and weak as 
condom material (You can imagine how many pumps those are good for!) with 
little or no cloth weave in the material.  Compared to German NOS diaphrams 
they really are garbage if you intend to daily drive you VW.
