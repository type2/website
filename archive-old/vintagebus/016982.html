I'm 5'5&quot;, with a 28&quot; in-seam.  I can go for a long time without pain,
or ten minutes.  It all depends on how my left leg is positioned.  If
you're putting any sort of twisting force on it, it's going to start
hurting.  So, it's a combination of your hip angle, thigh length, and
foot position that determine what's going to happen.  For me, pointing
the foot at the front edge of the driver's door results in the least
discomfort.  I'd say that probably the main thing is making sure that
your knee and your foot are pointed in the same direction.
