Subject: Custom Heater boxes

I was wondering if anyone has any information on Custom Heater boxes
that will work on an upright converted type 4 motor. I have opted for
the extra power and tork of a type 4 motor but would like to have heat
as well. Someone awile back at a show mentioned that someone in Euorpe
was manufacturing such a setup. Anyone know who that could be? Or does
someone on the list have a set they want to sell/trade?
I have a near NOS Stewart Warner heater (used for three months in my old
DD) and a rebuilt very nice late model BN 4 as heat related trading
material.
Thanks
