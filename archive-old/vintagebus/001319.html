Subject: Weird ductwork on 66 bus

In my 66 bus, I have this weird rectangular ductwork tube in the rear right
next to the left fender and I had Rob Laffoon of the VintagVW list look at
it and he, too, didn't know what it was.

Here's a message I got from Rob the next day after he looked at it
:
Hey Erin
Justin was looking through some heater manuals of mine and he came across
this picture and came over and showed it to me. this is what you have in the
back of your van. It is the original tube for hooking up a gas heater. talk
at you later
Rob and Justin

Check out the picture Rob sent me at:

I don't have the actual duct that comes all the way down to the floor almost
but I do have a rectangular tube that sticks out a couple inches so that the
ductwork could be fitted.  The other end runs right along the gas tank
underneath the filler and stops shy of the engine.

I would assume then that this was the fresh air intake for a gas heater that
would have affixed to the floor under the back seat in a bus, correct?
