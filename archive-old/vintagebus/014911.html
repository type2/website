With a shop pit, this actually wouldn't be too painful a thing to do
with the stock hosing provisioning.  I wonder if that's the &quot;tool&quot; I'm
missing.  Thanks.

Well, plus all the fuel in the line itself, that drains out once
you've disconnected it.  Not as bad as a full-flow tank draining
experience, but still annoying.

Well, how much force should it take to move the switch itself by hand,
no cable involved?  It takes a fair amount of force on mine, and I can
see the cable bend a *lot* if someone else pushes on the knob.

I'll certainly do this, on general principles.  Thanks for the
procedure write-up.
