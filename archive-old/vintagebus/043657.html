&gt;Right now the horn positive wire runs from fuse 8 which I believe is
&gt;always hot. I'd move it to fuse 7 which I believe is only hot when the
&gt;ignition is on or hotwired at the front of the bus.

True on both counts.

&gt;Then splice into the horn grounding wire between the horn and horn 
&gt;button with a little hidden switch, which when closed, grounds the
&gt;horn.

You might want to do this right at the horn - there isn't much of
that grounding wire that is exposed, basically the jump from the
steering box to the horn.  If you splice it too close to the bottom
of the steering box, you may have to replace the wire up through
the column which I understand to be a PITA.  The switch can go
anywhere you want, but make the connection at the horn.

&gt;Ignition on, switch closed: loud noise. Ignition on, switch open: 
&gt;horn functions normally. Ignition off: no horn, but that's fine.

Sounds good to me.  Some places have laws about how long a car
alarm can sound, but it seems to me that if you plan on being
around when this device is triggered, this shouldn't be a problem.
There is some possibility that a knowledgeable thief would jump out
and pull the horn wire under the bus upon hearing the horn start up,
but it's better than having your Bus be gone...

You might also want to consider the traditional &quot;kill switch&quot; in
the ignition wire.  Simple to wire and something else that might
make them look down the street.

&gt;I have kinda the same idea for my street legal buggy that I am putting 
&gt;togeter, only it implies an old siren of a 1950s 1960s (?) (6 volt) fire 
&gt;truck.

Besides the legalities already mentioned, there may be electrical issues.
If this is the kind of siren I am thinking of (like a 12-volt Federal
Signal &quot;Q&quot;), it is basically a starter motor with some cast metal vanes
on the front.  The 12v kind draw a *lot* of current - it would probably
be best to use a heavy relay (6v Ford starter relay) to switch the
current to the siren.
