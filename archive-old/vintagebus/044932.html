Wow, that was a helpful post.....thanks a lot David.  I hope to see more 
posts from you like that in the very near future.

Stephen merely asked for opinions and I gave him one.  I gave him mine and it 
was based on what I thought of him potentially sending out zipped copies of 
the archive to whoever asked for one.  If he were to send out CD ROM's of the 
archives, that wouldnt bother me either as long as he wasnt selling them for 
profit and I'm positive he wouldnt do that.

The only person I've ever seen squak about copyright info on the list is Bob 
Hoover and no, my searches in the archives havent been very 
positive/complete.  This is because I dont like the way Stephen's archived 
them, and if I have technical questions, I dont usually turn to the list, I 
have a select few people I ask personally.  But copyright issues and my 
archive searches arent what Stepehn asked for our opinions on now is it?
