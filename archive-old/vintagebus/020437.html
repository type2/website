I keep a 2 gallon can of gas in the non-battery side of
my engine compartment, and have for years.  Ever few
months, I dump it in the lawnmower and refresh it.

It's bailed my butt out a few times now, and several strangers
as well.

At one time I had a small can of gas on the roof rack,
for one of the CCC trips.  Someone locally macked it, so
I got another cheepie can, fillied it with gas, added a
couple of cups of sugar, and put it back in the rack.
It too was gone in a day or so.  Never did find out who
ended up with it...
