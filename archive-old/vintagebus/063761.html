Subject: Re: [VB] Have Gauges, Will Question

Never quite sure which post to respond to when several come in on the
subject.  Can provide some update on the subject, however.

&gt;&gt;&gt; &lt;Claralw_at_aol_dot_com&gt; 08/01/02 10:30AM &gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;actually I've used 20/50 a lot and been happy.  but 10/40 is too thin
for the 
&gt;&gt;90s F. or in your temps even use 40wt.  

I changed the oil last night.  Strainer clean.  No metal in the
strainer cover/drain. Put in the Castrol 20W50.  Then I started tracking
other oil pressure possibilities.  First stop, the oil pressure relief
valve.  Pulled plug and spring.  Plunger didn't fall right out, but
didn't have to try the 10mm tap to pull it.  A couple of turns with a
screw driver and it fell out in my hot, oily hand.  Quick check of specs
led me to &quot;wrong spring.&quot;  Specs I have say 2.44&quot; to 2.52&quot; length.  Mine
was well over that.  Had two other springs in my stash.  Found one
meeting length spec and put it in.  
=========================

&gt;&gt;no- it is normal for oil the get thinner as the engine warms up- like
butter 
&gt;&gt;melting.

Sure hope so.  Otherwise butter on pancakes would stick in your craw
(&quot;Heavy on the 90 weight, Mom!&quot;)

&gt;&gt;ya- maybe check your pump, but you are running a thin oil for summer
so why 
&gt;&gt;not use a thicker oil first and see how that changes things.  If you
do want 
&gt;&gt;to investigate the pump- spec it with a feeler guage to see how much
play is 
&gt;&gt;in the old one, and also in the new one.

Went back to the pump issue to determine if I'd put in a new one. 
Located my oil pump box with pump wrapped in plastic inside.  Pulled out
the pump to find traces of Permatex 3H on it--obviously an old one, so
the new one is in the engine.

&gt;&gt;Wrapping a towel around a sack of ice and bungeeing it in place in
the engine 
&gt;&gt;bay in spare battery area works to cool engine in hot dry climates.  
(just 
&gt;&gt;dont want the plastic bag or towel getting sucked into the fan)

Or bungeeing it to the driver to improve blood flow to the brain.  Just
make sure the plastic bag doesn't go over your head.

So, oil change done and correct spring in oil pressure relief valve, I
drive.  Oil pressure improvement at operating temperature.  Oil light
only goes on at idle.  Still not optimum, but getting better.  I take it
out on highway, oil at ~30psi.  Hit 55mph and holding pressure. 
Now...watch that CHT climb to 350 and beyond...it's getting HOTTER! 
Would have thought the better oil flow would have allowed for better oil
cooling and translate to lower CHT. 

May have to start using Chapter and Verse from a book other than
&quot;Lubrication and Maintenance.&quot; Need something thicker. Now, where's that
gallon of 80W90 I can't use in my transmission because it eats yellow
metal?
