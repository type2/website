&gt; What does everyone use on the valve cover side of the gasket. anything at all?
&gt; I was putting my covers back so I can go back in, and was wondering if anyone
&gt; used anything.  It didn't leak before, never been on the road yet, at least
&gt; from the valve covers.

all I ever do is make sure both sides are perfectly clean and no dents,
dings etc.  and then just put it on dry.
