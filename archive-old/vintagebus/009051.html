The best resource I can think of would be A. J. Hornung at the Air-Cooled VW
Junkyard
&lt; http://www.acvwjyro_dot_com &gt; website [the yard itself is probably condos or a
7-11 by now].  He's made several trips to Costa Rica in recent years
[writeups on the website], scoping out the local VW scene with an eye to
relocating his operation there.
