Subject: Westy roof rack Q
To: type2 &lt;vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com&gt;

Can anyone tell me or hook me up with a picture for
the location of the Westy tag's for a wood slat roof
rack?  This if for a later 13 slat style, not the
earlier ones.

Also,  Does anyone know for certain if there was a
additional bar across the legs of the westy rack for
the fold up ladder to attach to.

Thanks
Matthew
