&gt;im trying to find the bumper with those guard thingys. i forget what 
&gt;theyre called. but theyre the generic 60's bumpers. with the pipe
&gt;things on top.

Usually called &quot;over-riders&quot;.  Somtimes called &quot;the plumber's special&quot;.
In German M-code lists they are usually Rammschutz, &quot;ramming protection&quot;.

&gt;And, has anyone ever made their rear fenders back to normal? [...]
&gt;would i be replacing a whole panel or what?

Usually you make up a panel that is just a little bigger than the piece
they cut out and weld it to your Bus, then sand, fill, and paint.  Rex
