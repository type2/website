&gt; You almost speak 100% truth.  Everything is correct except the part
&gt; about living near Oregon.  Everyone thinking about the transplant should
&gt; look at Joe's stuff.  I've got one and you can even take a peek at

Although I am very much against the idea of a type4 engine in a bus,
(especially in a pre-72:)), Joe Licero is someone who I know, and will
vouch for his mechanical and engineering ability, thoroughness, the
quality of his product, and his forthrightness as a business man.
So if you are bound and determined to go this route, Joe is the man to
talk with. He is very happy to spend an hour on the phone with you, and
explain it step by step. Something you will not find with many vw
vendors.

And he doesn't need a core upright engine, so box up the old single port
and send it to me-- collect freight.  :)
