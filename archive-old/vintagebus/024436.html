At the tail end of my recent 5000mile trip to the canadian rockies and back,
my gas gauge decided it liked the 3/4 of a tank position. I was amazed at my
great mileage until I sputtered to a stop. At the filling station, topping up
did not help. The gauge worked for the whole trip and suddenly it stuck at
3/4. Any ideas? - Tim Gartman Mpls.
