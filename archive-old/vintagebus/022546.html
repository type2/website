The '55 is now sporting a new coat of paint.

There's a reason the word &quot;paint&quot; contains the word &quot;pain&quot; - that's a lot
of real estate to paint!

I was virtually run-less until I mixed up a tiny batch to make one last
pass around the bus, and I think I made it too thin, so it started running
like crazy.  I also have a buncha orange peel.  Surprisingly, I had almost
no orange peel on the roof, but the sides peeled a bunch.  

I used one of the harbor freight HVLP guns.  I think I shoulda stepped up
to a name-brand one ($160 vs $60) - oh well.

I still have to do the engine lid, bumpers, dash tray, gas door, vent
panel, etc, etc.

I'm also going to install a locking sterring column, and maybe an ambulance
fan.

Well, it's just going to sit there and dry for now.

Pix available on my site.
