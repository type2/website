Subject: Heat tube

Before I left for the desert last December I wired open my heat exchangers
so the SO could keep the kiddies warm when she drove the bus. When I got
back there was no heat coming out, I thought that maybe the wires came off
from the heat exchanger arms so I left it go. Well I finally started
snooping around to see what was up. Turns out the heat tube in the middle of
the bus (the one with the insulation on it) fell off! Looks like it just
rusted away. I was pretty surprised because there isn't much rust on the
rest of the undercarriage. Water must have got trapped in the insulation and
rusted that thing apart!
I'm planning on taking the bus off the road this winter for a complete resto
so ain't gonna worry about it for now, but I'll have to come up with
something to fix it! Anybody have any suggestions?

Jim
