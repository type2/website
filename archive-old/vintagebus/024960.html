Subject: Re: [VB] what to power my splitty with.
To: aircooledvwfreak_at_home_dot_com, vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

out there somewhere is a website that shows how to do this as well. its in a 
bay. owner fabed a pretty nice radiator cover for it. it was incased in what 
looked like  a spare tire cover mounted on the nose. pretty slick 
instalation(not that gm motors belong in a bus) anyone know how to find this 
site?


&lt;&lt; I remember reading on the RAMVA newsgroup a while back that someone  was
 doing a tv show that shows how to install a vortec(i think) V-6 into a
 bus(can't remember if splitty, bay..). I know the show was supposed to air
 in January and I believe it was a 9 hour job. That is something you might
 want to look at if you are considering that route. Hope this helps!
