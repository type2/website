Subject: Re: [VB] Books with changes through the years?
Message-ID: &lt;Pine.LNX.4.10.10011200016380.27882-100000_at_birdbird&gt;

Hello all!

I got several responses to my query about books with changes to the
Bus through the years.  In brief, my list of such books is now:

Muir/Idiot manual

Bentley/'63-'67 workshop manual

VW/Parts books

VW/Progressive Refinements v1 and v2

Stefan Doliwa/VW Transporter, Die technische Dokumentation 1950-1990

Joachim Kuch/Volkswagen Model Documentation

NEATO-BK-SSVC/Pamphlet or brochure (out of print; possible new edition)

In not-so-brief, here are some of my responses to a couple of the posts:

&gt;
&gt;&gt;Allegedly there's an English version [of the Doliwa book] but I
&gt;&gt;haven't been able to find it.
&gt;
&gt;Well, now you have.  It was just reissued in English as &quot;Volkswagen
&gt;Model Documentation.&quot;

That's a different book.  Doliwa lists the German version of this
book (Volkswagen Modellgeschicte) as a reference.  The German
version is http://www.amazon_dot_de/exec/obidos/ASIN/3613018810 and the
English version is here http://www.amazon_dot_com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0837600782 .

I saw this book at my FLVWPS Saturday.  It's a nice book, but as you
noted, it covers many models.  The Doliwa book has Type 2 only.  Also,
the Kuch book seems to list only the major changes, while the Doliwa
book has more detail.

&gt;the best is a nice collection of parts lists, with the editions put
&gt;out at diff times.

The one online at http://home.cwru_dot_edu/~agw4/docs.htm has already
helped me.  But I agree that having several from different years
would be even better.

&gt;It does not read like you might expect.

I had a summer job for four years as a phone rep, selling major appliance
parts for GE.  So I'm used to looking at parts lists like this - see
the picture, get reference number, find actual part number by reference
number.  Ours were on microfilm but they are pretty much the same format
as the VW ones I've seen.

&gt;I think it would be very difficult to write a comprehensive book of
&gt;changes for the public.   Would it be organised by year, by part
&gt;section, by model ??

Ideally it'd be electronic so I could sort it by any of those criteria.
:)  The Doliwa book has this problem.  It is mainly broken down by
year - calendar year, not model year, so some of the changes on my
early '64 (15 Nov '63) are listed under '63.  Then each year is broken
down into sections: engine/clutch/heating, front axle, rear axle,
brakes/wheels/tires, body, electrical, and &quot;general modifications&quot;
(things like production starting at Hannover or a new model being
introduced).  Within each one of those sections, the changes are
listed by chassis number and date.  You have to do a little flipping
around to find when a particular change happened, but it does have
a lot of info in one place.

Thanks for all the responses and replies!
