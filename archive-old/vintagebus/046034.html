Subject: torch questions
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

Having watched a friend of mine remove the front door of my bus with his 
torch and a screw driver in just a couple of minutes I've been on the look 
out for a used one. I found one here local for what seems a reasonable 
price($125 w/tanks), and was wondering if there is anything in particular I 
should look for as far as worn/damaged parts. Any regular maintainance these 
require to remain is safe operating condition? Bad brands to look out for?
thanks
ronnie
