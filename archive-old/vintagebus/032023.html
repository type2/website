&lt;&lt; The accelerater cable on my '61 doublecab bust and I lost the carb end

Hi Michael,
Hmm, the length given from MAR 1955-OCT 1964 is 3,564mm.  If you are having
one made to order you would be wise to have an adjuster installed up front in
the cable so you can fine tune it up near the front suspension.  Also have at
least two made up and carry the second as a spare!
