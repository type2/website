Howdy. I know it's not quite Friday, but I'll be out travelling tomorrow, and I
had to share the news. After being around me and my busses for almost 9 years,
my parents, both strict Chr*sler/F*rd people, just purchased a new '99 Eurovan
camper! They had been discussing replacing their frail, aging American mini-van
for a while, but I didn't actually think they'd really buy a VW. Even though we
all had a great time when we rented a Vanagon Westy for our summer vacation a
few years ago, I didn't think it had all made that much of an impression.
 Imagine my surprise last weekend, when I pulled into their driveway and saw
the big, white, fine example of German engineering there! We took it out to a
state park for the weekend, and I must say it is waaaaaayyyyyyy cushier than my
split. It has all the super modern camper stuff, and is very nice indeed. Of
course, they haven't let me drive it yet, but they are really digging it, and
are currently camping in Tennessee.
So, who says you can't teach old dogs new tricks? Remember, you never know who
you'll convince to buy a VW!
:)
Happy bussing,
