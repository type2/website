Subject: engine lid unlocked!!
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

Thanks everyone for the suggestions. I talked to the PO and he couldn't 
understand how it got locked being as he had never locked it in the 8 years 
he owned it. So I whipped out the WD-40 and UNSTUCK the mechanism. I don't 
think it had been turned in quite a while and it took a little muscle but now 
it's open. So thanks everyone!!
