Better late than never on the info I guess.   I've gotten lots of email for
information on BBS2001 so here's a heads up with website coming soon.  The
campout will not be held at Assateaque Island National Seashore this year
for various reasons.  

1. There just wasn't enough reservations available for all who wanted to
attend last year, we peaked on space our first year.
2. Everyone loves a hot shower.

I've secured a new location surrounded on 3 sides by water just 5 miles down
the road with plenty of room to grow.  The new site is beautiful, and the
owner seems fairly excited about being a permanent host of the event.  So
here is the info...

Busses by the Sea 2001

When - September 14,15,16
Where - Frontier Town Campgrounds  Ocean City Maryland
http://www.frontiertown_dot_com/
How Much - $21 a night, reservations are NOT needed

What going on ?

Friday - Arrive early, get the good camp spot, kick back with a cool one and
greet the new arrivals
Saturday - Pot Luck Dinner followed by a 5 mile carabus to Assateaque Island

Sunday - Big Breakfast and sad farewells

Things to do while your here.
Frontier town is a western themed campground.  If ever there was a family
bus event, this is it.  There is a free water park, playgrounds, canoe
rentals, nature trails, Ocean City shopping, and a great beach and ocean to
play in.

bring...

Bug spray

Canoe or Kayak
