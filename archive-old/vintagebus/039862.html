Hey y'all
I've been watching this thread with amusement.  My 'other love' is 
motorcycles, having been wrenching and riding for years.  I currently 
own/maintain 2 aircooled BMWs in addition to 2 buses.  I've wrenched in bike 
shops on both coasts.

Motorcycles use cables to operate the carburators.  I have no troubles 
synchronizing anything between 2 to 6 carbs on a motorcycle and once you get 
over the initial cable streach, cables hold their setting very well.  The 
streach can be lessened if your return springs do not have a huge amount of 
tension. I've had better luck maintaining the synch on my cable operated 
bikes than I have with the Kadron push/pull on the Express.

This, and $1.00 will get you a cup of coffee in some places.

Mad Uncle Dave
