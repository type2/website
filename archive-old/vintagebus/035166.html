&lt;&lt; Then we talked about an AIRS decal for
 members to put on there buses, I think that this decal would cause people
 who don't know what Airs is to ask &gt;&gt;

How about we all get the backlit redcrosses like on ambulances and mount to 
the roof or like a foglight?  :D  Thats what im gonna do.  Put on some airs 
logos on the side door windows.

Actually the idea of the decal is great and I will offer my time and services 
to make as many as needed for everyone.  

EVERYONE is ALWAYS welcome to stay at my home, not in the driveway but in a 
nice cozy bed.
