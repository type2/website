The front beam on a bus is larger than the bug beam. If it is a standard
$39.95 bug tow bar, no it won't work. The tow bar also needs to be longer
for buses. The U-haul 'chain it to the bumper' kind work, if the bumper is
solid and you don't mind a few scratches. Uncle Jerry has posted about a bus
tow bar from Dr. Joe in Phoenix a few times.  You should be able to find it
in the archives. I've  seen them, they work for splits and bays. I wouldn't
want to tow a lot with one, but occasional use they should work okay. Most
people that want to tow buses a lot make their own.

&gt;I have a bug tow bar. Can I use this to tow a bus ? if not, how does one
tow a
&gt;bus ? I've searched the archives ( i did my homework ;)

&gt;Thanks, Dan
