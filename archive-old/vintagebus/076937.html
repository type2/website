I think I'll make a nice wooden platform for the battery to sit on, about 
1-3/4&quot; to 2&quot; thickness should do the trick.
Hi Gary,
The problem with that is all the dirt and rain water that is sucked into the 
engine compartment with get under the wooden platform you are planning causing 
corrosion.  Plus any battery acids that gets out of the top of the battery 
drains down to this area causing the huge corrosion problem for not only the 
battery tray, but the whole left rear corner.  Thus the huge differance in 
condition of the battery tray area compared to the opposite non-battery area tray on 
the driver side!!
  So absolute best long term fix for a daily driver non-show bus is to:
1. Remove all sulfuric acid residue with 1 Tbsp baking soda dissolved in 
about two cups of water.  Repeat this mixture and work in with an old tooth brush 
in all the corners and cracks till you have no more bubbly chemical reaction.
2.  Wash the area out with water and dish washing soap and the tooth brush 
til all grease/oil/dirst is removed.
3.  Once dry sand, wire wheel, and phospheric acid treatment like Naval Jelly 
you can get from the harware store, till all rust is removed.
4.  Weld up holes and patch in areas or replace the whole battery tray.  Zinc 
primer and even a coat of cheap spray paint will work.
5.  VW installed thick tar papaer strips to keep the battery tray and the 
bottom of the battery seperate, so we fab up these strips out of thinner 
household tar paper folded over several times.  We also tar the battery tray area just 
under the battery and a few inches outward with roofing asphault and glue the 
tar paper folded strips together and down to the tray with this tar.  Just 
make sure the drian holes in the battery tray are not blocked with the tar 
paper.  The stock battery tray only had two drain holes and we added two more so 
there is a drain in each corner of the battery tray.
6.  Lastly we find plastic battery boxes at FLAPS and swaps/garage sales for 
our lead/acid auto batteries to be put inside of.  This prevents almost all of 
the sulfuric acid that escapes the batteries from condensing on the exterior 
of the battery and being later washed down the side of the batteries onto 
sheet metal when rain water gets on them!!!  Battery boxes come in all sizes.  We 
look for ones that fit snugly as possible to the left to right as installed in 
the bus.  The plastic battery box can be cut down to below the top of the 
battery and the plastic box top not used.  We have in some cases cut and welded 
with a soldering iron thes boxes shorter in the longer front to rear length.
  All of the above can take a weekend to fix/setup.

  If one does not have the time and gumption then at the very least...
1. nuetralize the battery acid.
2. dry out battery tray.
3. tar up entire battery tray.
4.  buy a battery box.
This will help your battery tray and RR corner last many more years if not 
decades!!!
