I did on the '60 - to the amazement of my VW friends - but the '55 and '54
will remain 6v.  Actually I currently (get it? Ohm my, I couldn't resist!
Watt a line!) have the '54 converted to 0v

&gt;I went through the whole decision making process as to whether or not I

&gt;accessories like a cell phone, stereo, and all kinds of modern goodies that
&gt;really makes my bus fulfill its obligation of a good, solid, daily driver.
&gt;I would leave a bus 6v if it was a low miles, original condition bus that
&gt;had never been hacked/no rust etc. but that would be a garage queen type of
&gt;bus.  Even VW considered 12v an improvement in 1967 in split window buses.
&gt;Why not &quot;improve&quot; the older buses and update them to later VW standards?
