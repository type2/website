Subject: cleaning engine compartment

For the Love of God, do not use oven cleaner.  I
accidently used some in my compartment, and what used
to be beautiful factory paint is now bare metal.  I've
also noticed that some engine degreasers/cleaners warn
you not to get on paint, as it may stain/ruin.  Either
way, hot water + dish detergent seems to work well, no
paint lost, but the grease is gone.  but if you're
looking to get paint off, Easy Off oven cleaner works
wonders.
