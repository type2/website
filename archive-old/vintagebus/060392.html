Subject: RE: [VB] Marvel mystery oil- motors that sat years- white smoking exhaust


  If you put really a lot of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Marvel in it, you may have pumped some into the exhaust,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;and that will take a little longer to burn off.

I sure did. It did get in the exhuast. I burned the rest off at lunch
today. Another oil change coming (second one, and it just got to run,
you never have to worry about me changing oil enough on aircooleds..I
change it even if I drove on a dirt road a few miles!, aircleaner too, I
think of the oil AS the filter)...
Running pretty good, even with nasty oil fouled plugs! Just getting
ready to tune, bleed brakes, and test drive the old girl... Now to get
back to #1 importance, the BUS! She gets a new speedo while I repair
(hopefully) the OE one.
