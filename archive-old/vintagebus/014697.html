Subject: 6 volt jump-starting
Date: Thu, 06 Jan 2000 10:38:34 -0700
Sender: dworkin_at_village_dot_org


So the &quot;dead battery&quot; subject reminded me of a problem I've not yet
had, but fully expect to encounter some day: needing a jump on the 6
volt microbus.  Doing that from a 12 volt vehicle just won't work
(well, it'll probably start, but it'll also blow all the indicator
lights).  I have my doubts regarding random jump-start services.  Any
suggestions?
