VW went to a August -&gt; July model year beginning in August, 1955 for the
'56 model year.

Although, it didn't always start in August...

I'm pretty sure October, '57 is a 1958 model.

A breakdown of VIN# vs. month/year on my site:

Your Bus might have taken a little longer to build, but not much, only th=

Bus is a Westy, it definately took longer since it went to Westfalia on
the way...

&gt;Thom's site says this bus was built in October of 1957 for the 1957 mode=
l
&gt;year and that a &quot;correction&quot; in the database was suggested.  While doing=

&gt;bodywork, the stampings on the panels are dated august 56.  There is no
M
&gt;code plate which I believe was used in '58.  I guess my other question
here
&gt;is, what year did VW start using the &quot;model year&quot; as opposed to a januar=
y-january
&gt;year? Could this bus have been a special-order model '57 which took a bi=
t
&gt;longer to produce hence the '58 registration?
