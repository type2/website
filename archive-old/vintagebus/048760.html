Subject: accelerator cable &amp; the rear engine tin seal

I just got done putting my motor back in my bus. This time I did 
remember to fish the accelerator cable through the tube and tin 
before mounting the engine. But I installed a new rear engine tin 
seal and didn't make a notch in it where the cable comes through. Now 
the engine is in, and I've got to figure out a way to do it. The main 
problem is my fat hands and short arms have trouble getting up in 
there. I've got a handy mirror on a stick tool and a light. I can see 
where I need to do my cut. Just don't know how I'm gonna get at it. 
So short of pulling the engine...any bright ideas? I'm headed to the 
archives right now to see if I can dig up anything there as well.

p.s. I used someones trick here of sticking chewed bubble gum on the 
back of the motor mount screw that's next to the starter. Held it in 
while I got my bolt started. Nice little trick!
