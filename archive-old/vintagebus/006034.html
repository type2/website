I'm searching for a particular vendor who was in Whitmann, AZ in October 1999. Were any of you there? My attempts to contact the promoter of that show have failed (Thanks UJ). If you were there please p-mail me so I can pose my questions.

Bus content - 

I delivered the shell of the last bus to the yard Thursday. The driver put the forks through the window holes to lift it off the trailer. Everything below the top of the wheel wells stayed on the trailer when he lifted it. It's so sad to see one go to the grave but -
