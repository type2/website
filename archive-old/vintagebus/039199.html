Hi,

I just noticed that there is a puddle forming in the wheel well panel just
in front of the driver door post. Water drains out of the rear hole into a
hole at the base of the door post. It does not drain out. Should a hole be
drilled somewhere? I looked for a drainage hole but found none. What's the deal?

Bob
