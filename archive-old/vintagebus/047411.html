&lt;&lt; Hello everyone. Quick question. I am greatly considering getting my bus 
 painted. Right now it has the original paint on it which is in good 
 condition. It is Pearl White/Green color scheme. I have always liked the 
 Chestnut Brown/Sealing wax red colors and I am considering these for the new 
 paint job. How will this affect the value of the bus in the end? I do plan 
on 
 keeping it but you never know what could happen. So, original or unoriginal? 
 I am very curious to know.. Thanks in advance for your replies.
 
     Best wishes,

I know your bus, I knew about your bus before my friend that sold it to you 
knew about it, and it is a nice bus. IMHO you would be throwing your money 
away, think about how many hardtop deluxes there are in the whole world. Now 
think about how many of them are wearing there original paint, and Velvet 
Green no less. If you read the list occasionally you will remember all the 
hub bub about the original paint 23 window that sold at the classic. Keep it 
correct colors for the what it says on the M number plate.
