to all on the list a warning about Rich and Andy Kimball (yea that's right
that rich Kimball) I bought an item from him and his son on ebay that was
listed to fit a specific vehicle that it does not. now before you all think
I am petty and childish think of this--- you pay 365.00 for a nos exhaust
tip that is supposed to specifically fit a single tailpipe split or oval
(mind you its almost 2 inches too big) this was a robri by the way,   then
you are told that maybe its missing parts ??? what I said,   no no  robri's
are supposed to clamp to the pipe without hardware (just the two halves)
well rich said i never tried it,   so I said how about if I keep it and get
a partial refund or I send it back and get a full refund-   well make a long
story short  he said no and said it was sold as is    but that statement was
not on the listing either,   just a word to the wise don't buy from vwnutt
