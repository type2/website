&gt; You mention, &quot;Consider a 2 gauge cable, especially if your Bus is 6 V.&quot;

&gt; I did a quick internet search and there is 2 gauge and 2/0 gauge. Supposedly
&gt; the 2/0 gauge is even thicker, stronger connections etc. Any experience with
&gt; this stuff? Is it worth going to 2/0 gauge, or is that stuff so thick it's
&gt; hard to use? Does 2/0 mean that basically it is between 2 and 0 gauge?

2/0 gauge, also called 00 guage, is half again as thick as 2 guage.  It's
really stiff stuff and might be hard to fit through the tin without
enlarging the existing hole. Here's a web reference table:

The guage you are interested in is AWG.

Frankly, the VW engine is very small and doesn't need a huge amount of
starting current.  Additionally, the starter cable on the VW is quite
short compared to a typical Chevy.  A 2-guage cable should be plenty, even
at 6V.
