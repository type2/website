My 54 deluxe was a logoed courtesy bus for an accounting firm, they
photographed IBM punch cards for record keeping, the top was chestnut brown
and the lower was YELLOW of some sort, the ambo fans were also painted the
same color as the lower half of the bus.

Wonder if it was an airport bus- you know to move the luggage to the plane 
And back?  Saw a double slider 21 window in yellow with limited slip 
differential and mountain gears (lots on that M code tag)  that had been 
ordered as an airport luggage bus.   Guess they wanted the sunroof so they 
could toss the bags in from above.
