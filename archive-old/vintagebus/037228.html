Hi Amanda,
That is a bit wierd since you have a Sundial.  It sounds like you have a 
Riviera Camper tent.  Does the tent have a rope sewn in the edge that slides 
into that aluminuim channel over the cargo doors?  If so you might want to 
buy the proper tent from PLF and then sell/ trade off what you have now.
