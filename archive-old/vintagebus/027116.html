Subject: Cylinder shim question (long techie question)

Hey y'all
My ISP keeps dropping the mail server so I've been off'n on the list
(admins PLEASE LET ME KNOW so I have ammo to go back to them with).

My lovely wife measured the deck heights and re-cc'd the heads (hint -
use a Sharpie or other indelible marker instead of pencil if you're
writing measurements on the head).  Anyways, using Ron and Dale's most
excellent nifty Excell cr calculator we arrived at the following
figures:
Cylinder   #1 #2 #3 #4

Bore (mm) 90.5
Stroke (mm) 69
Area of Base (mm)  6429
Deck Height  (mm) Calculated 2.92 2.84 2.97 2.92
Deck Volume (cc's) Calculated 18.77 18.28 19.09 18.77
Swept Volume (cc's) Calculated 443.62 443.62 443.62 443.62
Chamber Volume (cc's) Measured 57.93 58.05 57.55 57.50
Total Volume  (cc's) Calculated 520.32 519.95 520.27 519.89

Original Deck Height (Inches) Measured 0.033 0.03 0.047 0.045
Shim Height (Inches)                            0.082 0.082 0.07 0.07
Total Deck Height (Inches) Calculated    0.115 0.112 0.117 0.115
Cylinder  Volume                  #1    #2    #3     #4
Average Value                      57.93 58.05 57.55 57.50
Shim Height (Inches)             0.082 0.082 0.07 0.07
Compression Ratio Calculated 6.78 6.81 6.79 6.82

Our question is this:  Is it permissible to use 2 shims at the base to
get the required deck height?  We want to keep the cr low yet still have
to go to pull the mountains (and stumps if need be).

Please guide us, o wise and venereable gurus!

be digging in my business.  You don't even know my dog's name.
