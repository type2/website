&lt;&lt; What's a &quot;weird big cover intake manifold&quot;? &gt;&gt;
Hi Everett,
Think she means the covered 1955 only manifold that had welded on cover 
tubing over/around the vertical part of the intake manifold just below the 
carb.  This cover allowed hot exhaust gases to circulate around this part of 
the manifold to prevent icing.  This type of manifold all too soon rusted out 
and allowed exhaust gasses into the mainfold and back into the engine.  So 
not many remain to be seen today.  Eric&amp;Barb
