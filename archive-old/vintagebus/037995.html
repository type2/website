Well the day started off without a hitch.......
1st of all, I decided to drive the trailer queen show bug instead of the 63 
hardtop deluxe. (bus content) Maybe that was bad karma to start.
2nd pulling into the parking lot of the normal location at Solano County 
fairgrounds, the show was moved to some further away gate entrance and spot. 
Driving through the parking lot the get to the correct gate I hear a pop, 
sounds like a clutch breaking sound. Second indication that something is 
starting to go wrong is the girlfriend who says &quot;what was that noise&quot;, of 
course I have to say nervously &quot;oh, we must have driven over some rocks or 
into a pothole&quot;. 20 yards later the tranny starts making a terrible grinding 
noise. Still goes into every gear, but when you let the clutch out it feels 
like the tranny is going to fall out.
Now, I'm broken down and never did make it into the show. Waited for a tow 
truck to come and tow me home. Ended up towing it to a friends house in 
Vallejo because he thought it might have been a spun drum. Was not the 
problem. Gets worse that we are getting married in two weeks and need the bug 
running to drive away in. 
Luckily a friend will fix the car since I'm finalizing wedding plans and 
moving this week.
Lots of nice busses driving past me into the show area. That was the highlite 
of the day.
More bus content:
At my friends house in Vallejo I got to check out a nice 56 single cab being 
painted Dove Blue. Pretty damn clean. Also had a 21 window for sale that runs 
good. p-mail me if anyone interested. All in all mostly chatted with some 
friends during the afternoon after getting the bug taken care of. 
Hope everyone else that made it to the show had a better time since I never 
made it in the gates.
