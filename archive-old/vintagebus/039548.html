So are you documenting what you are going through with pictures and text.  
It would be wonderful to add to the Vintage site for newbies to this as 
perhaps to vets as well.  We could add experience note to what you have!!  I 
for one am going to be doing this to my Bus (currently doing a Bug) and more 
info is better.  Staffan

&gt;
&gt;I got quotes anywhere from $500 to $1000.  Some places wouldn't
&gt;even do it. doug

&gt; &gt;  No problem.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;  Keep posting updates on the headliner installation. I have &gt;  the same 
&gt;job in my future in a 21 window. A guy I know
&gt; &gt;  paid $500 to get his done. I think I'll try one before I &gt;  resort to 
&gt;that.
