Could be.  Dawn was at the RMMW campout in a really cool shirt made from
Westy curtain fabric &amp; when I drooled on about it, she said Richard had
gotten a bunch of the nos fabric while at Bad Camberg this summer, &amp; she
would be making curtains out of it, etc.

Tom Buese-also looking for more of the yellow naugahyde
