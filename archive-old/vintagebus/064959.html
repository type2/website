Subject: 6.70/15 tires

Subject: [VB] RE: [T2] Chinese Tires 
		
&gt;    On another note, my local tire supplier has 6.70/15 bias 6 ply tires in
&gt; stock now. Wasn't this the original size tire on a pr 64 bus?

i have this size tire on my 1956 truck.  vintage nazis tell me that the tires are too tall - taller than original.  i seem to remember one of the v.n. telling me that the correct size is 6.60/15.  whatever, i like my big tires!

cheers,
