Subject: Re: [VB] bus dies a lot.

yeah, the carb needs re bushed. where can i get this
done? and about how much should it cost? id much
rather just get a new one so i wouldnt have to worry
about this for a while. this carb has never been
rebuilt, it has all the origional gaskets. i seriously
dont think its the fuel pump,as i completely cleaned
it out before i used it on this new motor, and i didnt
have these problems on the old motor. thanks for all
your help on this crazy trip to the mysterious
outreaches of my vw's mind. lol. thanks again.
