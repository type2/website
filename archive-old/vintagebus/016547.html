So it would be better to sell it as along block than as a complete motor
with generator, fuel pump rebuilt carb etc. ? I picked this engine up
used and ran it in my 67bug while I was rebuilding the stock 1500. This
was a couple of years ago. Before I took my cross county trip in the 68
westy  form San Francisco  (the lovebus chronicles) to finish my
degree.....
While still in the islands I did an all night thrash on the 67  to finish
it before my flight to SFO. I got the original engine in and took off for
the mainland.
Once there i worked as a mechanic in the day and swing shift in a
factory. I did that until i bought the westy and used it at my new job as
a lab tech; I lived in it; sitting in the hospital parking lot. I
showered in the hospital scrub room. That lasted until I got word that
they accepted me at school.
the love bus westy served me well until it was time to go home. I bought
the kombi with the intent of bringing it back to the islands. A freezing
rain, black ice accident in  San Antonio Texas put a stop to that. I had
a concussion and the kombi suffered a fount end crunched far enough back
to render the clutch inoperable. Various other road side repairs and
rebuilds took my time and savings; thus, broke, I was forced to look for
work in California. Forget flying back home or shipping the kombi here.
I worked enough odd jobs to make it home but haven't found work in my
field yet.
When i got back here I pulled this engine out of storage. I had donated
the heads to another  westy bus belonging to my friends now ex wife. I've
worked odd jobs for a while substitute school teacher , mechanic,
handyman. etc. But  no more lab jobs. Any way sense the last boss was
crooked and charging for warranty work not done, I Quit and build me this
here computer so I could go back on line and look for Biotech jobs.
The VW stuff keeps me sane but i miss my kombi. There was a south swell
yesterday but I didn't even go to the beach and instead worked to get
these engines going rebuilding carburetors setting up work benches in my
loft/apartment. I'm glad i hung on to all my small parts because It helps
in getting these things going.
This last engine ( the 1600 in this post's subject line) I'm working on
is a type one with a bus adapter  on the oil pump. I recall we had a hard
time getting that thing lined up and put bus short block in it. This
engine donated its heads to the westy. Would any one like to share there
experiences with these so called adapters?
