Subject: 2nd gear pops out - rebuild myself or have someone else do it?

Greetings volks,

I'm treading on new turf here, so I'll ask for advice from those that
have been in my position. I find it increasingly difficult to keep my
poor SingleCab's transmission in second gear. At first, it would pop
out under deceleration, so I coasted in neutral. Eventually, it got
worse to the point where it pops out under medium acceleration or if
I hit a bump while babying second gear up to speed. It's time to
rebuild. Now I am comfortable with engine removal as well as
transaxle removal, and I do have access to whichever tools will be
necessary - however I have never torn into one before. I do live near
an assortment of VW shops that could likely complete the job, but at
what cost? It would seem that I could save myself some serious cash
by performing this operation myself. What does the list think? Smart
idea? Dumb idea? I noticed a coupla' good resources in the
Library_at_Type2. Any further recommended reading?             

Thanks all,

Dylan Baxter
