Use a single stage acrylic enamel.  Don't bother with a good two part urethane
this time.  You'll save at least $100.00 bucks a gallon.  Be aware, that this
paint is much softer than a catalyzed paint.  You'll want to wait at least a
month or so if you plan on sanding and buffing.

&gt; Its dove blue, or better said WAS dove blue , most of the paint has faded  or
&gt; burned off.
&gt;
&gt; Since he wants to use it now we  need to do a quicky paint job for the winter.
&gt; Just to make it presentable........
&gt; then next year we can pull it apart and do it right
&gt; (yes we plan to paint over the dents)
&gt;
&gt; Any cheap paint ideas ?????
