i say just find an old front bumper at a local
scrapyard and weld up the appropriate hardware for
towing.then you could just bolt it on.

&gt; No thanks.  I'll find someone to weld one up for me
&gt; that fits, and out of
&gt; real steel too.  The design is okay, but Dr. Joe
&gt; should make them specific
&gt; to different year bus axles.  Look at the two types
&gt; of Bug towbars as
&gt; examples.
&gt; 
&gt; I'm not going to trust my rig to a couple of muffler
&gt; clamps.  A full width
&gt; rig out of heavier gauge tubing is the answer.
