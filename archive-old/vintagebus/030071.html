I'd advise NOT to clean  your cylinders this way.  I took someone's advice (I
think from the Tom Wilson book) and took my brand new piston and cylinders and
put them through the dish washer to clean all the shipping oil and grit off,
and to my horror were completely flash rusted (just the steel cylinders  and
wrist pins of course) when I opened the door.  Two frantic hours of oiling and
scrubbing finally cleaned 99% of the rust off, but I'll never do that again!
I'm not sure why it happened, but I think the moist heat during the dry cycle
and the freshly de-oiled steel equaled instant rust.

Ahh to have the room in my shop for a big oven....think of the powder coating
possibilities!
