Hello!

I am currently using the door seal kit that I got for my '66 (which isn't
done) for my '60 DC, which is my current daily driver.

My fingers hurt from trying to jam that damn mass of rubber that calls
itself the vent wing seal into its groove.  Any advice?  Is it correct of me
to have installed the vent wing flap first?  And leave material past where
the vent wing seal goes?

TIA

Gene
