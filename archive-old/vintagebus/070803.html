Subject: Re: [VB] undercoating ?

It's been my experience with por-15 that unless it goes on thick it isn't as
effective.  I've sprayed it and rust came back.  Then I brushed the surface
down and reapplied it with a brush and ... no rust.  Don't they recommend 2
mm? or something.  If I were to spray it as undercoating I'd do at least 3
coats .. cause ... don't they recommend 2 coats with a brush?

My 60 had tons of undercoating on it that was really on there. I went under
my bus with a propane torch and a paint scraper.  I heated up the
undercoating and scrapped it off then I got one of those pump spray bottles
and filled it with gas and got under my bus and pumped and sprayed and the
gas washed the remnants of the old under coating off.  Of course I only did
a small part at a time and kept the fire extinguisher very close.  Than I
washed with soap and water - or some sort of degreaser. Then rinsed with
metal ready. Then rinsed with water.  Then brushed on 2 coats of por-15.
That was probably 4 or so years ago and it still looks really good.  There
were a few spots I missed like a couple of seams but I just got to touch em
up.
