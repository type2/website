&gt; Got a military issue gas heater 6v Stewart Warner Model # 978-M
&gt; Anybody know any info on it.  The guy that sold it to me said to get hold of
&gt; the National Guard at it was theirs and is NOS.

Rob:
Stewart Warner made those things since clear back in the 40's so it could be
just about anything. I imagine they made them for most any vehicle the National
Guard might have owned. There is a faily good chance that if it's in the right
year range the thing might be pretty similar to a VW one. I've got some old
catalogs somewhere and it seems to fit most models S-W just rearranged parts
with a few different brackets.
Good luck in your quest.
