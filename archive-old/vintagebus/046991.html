&lt;&lt; Does anyone have any Early 60s Westy interior line drawings. Thom has a 
line drawing of the roof structure and I wondered if there was similar for 
the rest of the interior. &gt;&gt;
Hi Andy,
Try http://perso.wanadoo.fr/olivier.d/ and then go down toward the bottom of 
the page and look for the DOC button.  Press and it takes you to a collection 
of Westie sales brochure.  The SO-34 &amp; SO-35 brocure has line drawings in it 
that may be of help to you.   Eric&amp;Barb
