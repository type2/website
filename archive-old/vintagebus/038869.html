Just to let everyone know you can still buy a 6 to 12 volt converter from many
different sources. Why none of the VW parts houses offer one I don't know. Pick
up a copy of Hemmings Motor News and take a look.  None of them are cheap,
upward of a $100. On the net JC Whitney list a real nice one. I use it on my 66
bug to power a mid 70's Blaupunkt AM/FM Radio. Some of the others I've used add
a hum to AM band the one from JCW does not. I've used it to charge a cell phone
or power a radio. It wouldn't run headlights or power a 100 watt rockford amp
nor start your car. 

You can see it for yourself at

If you go the other way and convert to 12 volts. They also sell another neat
gizmo that you can use to reduce and regulate the voltage to your fuel gauge. I
use one on my 63 single cab and it has been working for over a year.
