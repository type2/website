Subject: Re: [VB] ebay and sales tax]

Wow, never new. I've only lived in LA and San Francisco. Why those guys so
lucky?
You know though I don't think anyone has to pay sales tax if they buy
from the
internet. At least on the internet based ecommerce sites they don't, but I
guess if someone uses ebay as an aggregate then do they need to collect sales
tax?

&gt; &lt;&lt;Well right away if it's 7% (I've seen this one) in CA you know it's a scam
&gt; because the sales
&gt; tax here is I believe 8.5% or 8.25%. Hell they're not even smart enough to
&gt; get that extra
&gt; percent outta someone buy finding out what the actual percent is.
&gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt; In ventura county its 7.25%.
&gt; I think Sacramento is 7.75%
&gt; At work here in L.A. its 8.25%
