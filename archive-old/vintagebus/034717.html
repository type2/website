Subject: Re: Captive Nut  Freedom Tool   
To: lisaandtodd_at_att_dot_net, vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

The Captive Nut Freedom Tool is a Stahlwille.  # 1024.

it says STAHLWILLE UNO on the long arm, the short arm has 1024, the back of 
the long arm says  ALLOY STEEL   GERMANY on it.   

I got it at a pawn shop for a couple bucks.  Surely it is available from 
Stahlwille though.

haven't used it on the starter side.  For that side the ones that don't take 
the half moon I start the nut, put vise grips on the nut, then shimmy 
underneath with a ratchet, long extension, and 17mm socket to tighten it from 
under neath.   But I bet the captive nut freedom tool would work there as 
well.  Good idea, I'll try it next time.

 Captive nut sounds like my job description! Free the 
 nut! Free the nut!
 
 Actually, I am about to put a starter in my '62 and 
 remember what a PITA it was to get that top bolt tight 
 last time. Where did you find this nifty tool? Have a 
 picture? It seems like it would be a good companion to 
 my 17mm ratcheting box end wrench.

  Free the Nut!  
 I find it easier to put a nut on it and turn it inside the engine 
compartment.   Awkward to get it past the clutch arm etc, for me at least.  
Some cases take the half moon on that side, keeps them from turning.  For the 
ones that dont, I have a nifty tool that has a magnetic hex 17mm  thing and 
arms to keep it from turning.   Use a ratchet wrench in the engine  
compartment.   If people want the captive nuts, I have a couple I removed 
from cases.
