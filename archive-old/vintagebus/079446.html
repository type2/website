Subject: Re: [VB] helpin' hippies

How do you know when you've had hippies visting?

They're still there!

but seriously, some years ago me and a friend were in old Gus the Bus driving 
around sw orgeon/nw California when the brakes disappeared.   between crecent 
City and Arcata...(well there had been a smokin issue earlier in the front 
right wheel going down from Crater Lake but the brakes still worked..). well 
anyway on the coast... checked brake fluid.. none left... added some.. it left 
too... drove slowly to Arcata (had hand brake), went to a shop and asked if I 
could borrow a jack (jack points rusted out) and they sneered how they'd charge 
so much an hour to fix it... but this nice guy said we could stay at his 
friends house and he'd help me... so we did and he did and I proceeded to learn 
that there was such a thing as rubber brake hoses and that evidently their 
lifetime is somewhat less than 30 years... stayed for a couple days while the local 
store got the parts in and and met some nice people and went picking 
blackberries and it was pretty cool.
