Subject: Re: [VB] Fw: cory petrie. broke down

&gt;all is well he was able to get in
touch with Mark Dearing, of Salem Imports..&lt;

Mark is a good guy!  I was a little slow to help out here, but you all 
called the right guy :)

Mark gets a lot of action from people going North and South who seem to 
break down near him.  Or know to gimp a little further to get into Salem VA.


Good Luck,
Adrian Pillow
