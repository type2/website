--- Thom Fitzpatrick &lt;thom_at_calweb_dot_com&gt; piped up with:
&gt; Enter your bus in the registry and it will decode
&gt; them for you.
&gt; 
&gt; Reminds me - I need to add logic for the paint
&gt; stickers.

BTW, does anyone know if there are repop stickers
available?  While removing some of the paint on my
crew cab recently, I discovered that there was glue
below the m-code plate, but no sticker.  What do they
even look like?

Paul
