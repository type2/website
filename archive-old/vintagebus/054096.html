Subject: Re: [VB] On Balance


No tire shop in town has the &quot;spider&quot;
&gt; adopter to balance the
&gt; tires on my 1967 21DLX! I get the same story, need
&gt; the adopter to balance!
&gt; Is this a part that can be purchased? Or am I SOL?

Hart,

Wouldn't it be possible to take an extra front drum,
balance it, and use it as the adapter?  I've wondered
this for some time, as I think they can use some of
their small cones to center on the bearing races.  My
local tire dealer said he's willing to give it a try,
but I've never gotten around to it.
