The '64 Sundial I recently purchased had the awning windows ripped out and
replaced w/ Plexiglas.  Only one of the original windows remains.  The
original frames to the windows are still in place, but I think I'll need to
replace the entire unit.  I'm on the hunt for at least 4 of these.  Anybody
have some laying around they would like to part with?

Thanks!
