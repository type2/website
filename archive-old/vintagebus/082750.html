Subject: The Vintage VW Tourist in Germany

At long last I'm getting a chance to visit the VW Museum in Wolfsburg 
in a couple of weeks -- will be driving up from Frankfurt area to spend 
a couple of nights in Berlin.  I've visited the museum site and done a 
little research online but would appreciate tips for the vintage VW 
tourist as far as anything I might miss otherwise.

This will be my first trip to Europe (my sister's husband is in the 
USAF in Germany so I get free lodging &amp; a tour guide :).  I speak a 
little German and am really looking forward to it -- I'd spend the 
entire two weeks geeking out in Osnabruck &amp; Stuttgart, too, but I'm 
being dragged to such uninteresting places as Paris and the Alps as 
well &lt;sigh&gt;.  Base of operations will be SW of Frankfurt, so any tips 
for local sightseeing there (offlist, I guess would be best) are also 
appreciated.

Joe
