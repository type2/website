Hi Volk,
There are many, many differant lengths of stock 40HP and later engine push 
rods one can try first before attempting cutting them to length.  For the VW 
owner who plans on assembling more than one engine in thier lifetime there is 
even an adjustable steel rod to find the perfect length and then using this 
as a measure guide for either choosing or cutting rods to length.
  Wether buying an assembled or building your own engine it is important to 
make sure the rocker adjusting screws become parallel to the valve stems 
halfway through the arc of the rockers.  Otherwise the valves will be pushed 
or pulled slightly one way or the other into the side of the valve guides 
wearing the guides more on that side and ruining a otherwise perfectly 
running head/s all too soon.  Eric&amp;Barb
