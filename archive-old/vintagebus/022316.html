Volks-

Anybody have an idea what might be causing a knocking noise on startup?
The noise only lasts a minute or so, gradually diminishing as the engine
warms (I guess).  I checked the heads, and they are properly torqued.

FWIW, the knock doesn't seem fast enough to be related to something tied
directly to the crankshaft.  It seems more like exhaust?
