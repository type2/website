&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;On the subject of doing non-stock repairs.... has anyone put in/ made to
&gt; &gt;work a 71 bay turn signal switch in a 66/67?

from Matt:
&gt; I have no idea if it will fit mechanically.  Per the wiring diagrams,
&gt; though, you should be able to make it work electrically.  The '71
&gt; switch has everything you need for the turn signals (a wire for each
&gt; corner, flash input, and brake light input) plus the two connections
&gt; for your headlight dimmer relay (ground and switched ground to the
&gt; relay).

I went and got the 71 switch. There is no way to make the 71 housing fit. It
is 2 piece like a 67 and back but the part that goes around the column is
full circle. I would have had to remove the steering wheel to get it off but
the lower half of it is larger to fit around the support for the steering
column lock. I believe the switch itself will fit in a 66/67 housing, if I
had one...
However there is one wire short. The 71 has 8, 67 has 9. Missing is the
solid blue that goes to J5, the hazard switch. Not sure yet if this has not
been replaced by a different color wire. I only had time to count them, not
compare all the colors and destinations. I will hopefully get to that this
afternoon and post the results if there is any interest. [around here 70/71
bays are plentiful in the yards, 66/67 switches are not :)]
