To: VintageBus_at_type2_dot_com

Every year the Arizona Bus Club raffles off a bus and the cost of the tickets 
is only $.50!!!!!  Of course they don't sell tickets except at the event, and 
they sell a BUNCH of them.  Somewhere around 8-9,000 tickets.  Sell even 
1/8th that at $20/per and you're looking at $20,000!  Could a thousand 
tickets be sold in the US/Canada?  What about overseas?  Delivery to......?  
Who keeps track of tickets/money?  Who vouches for the validity when someone 
wants to claim some sort of foul?  

Lots of things to consider.  It is not easy.  I should know since I did the 
ABC raffle several years.  And that was the 'easy' version.  It's a do-able 
task but there must be folks that are commited to the EFFORT!!!

Just some thoughts,

Jon
