Subject: Hose clamps vs fittings

I've been using hose clamps on cooler lines for many years with good
results. I hear people say fittings/hard lines are the best way to go.
Any comments?
The oil pressure when an engine is cold is high, but I don't think it
gets up to 100 psi or does it?  I've used hose clamps on repaired garden
hoses for years which see up to 120 psi without problems.  Clamps do
need periodic tightening, but periodic line inspections should be done,
too. I've had hard lines and fittings leak about as often as clamps.
Once a P/S tube had a hairline fracture that only leaked when the
steering was turned all the way, couldn't see the crack, what a pain.
Yes, things go wrong, expecially for us with aging vehicles - fuel pump
diaphragms that let fuel into the crankcase, cooler seals that leak,
head gaskets that blow.  Using good quality hi press/hi temp hose,
barbed brass fittings and large clamps seems to be adequate, low cost,
easy to install and repair.
