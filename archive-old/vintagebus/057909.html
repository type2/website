&gt; Bus content... Went to a beer festival in Anderson Valley, CA. At least 6 splitty's camping out in the brewer's area. A sub-hatch Westy, double door panel from a cider company. My brother's '66 Riviera and the AVBC &quot;co-founder's&quot; '67 Riviera and others.  My DC is down with valve train problems so I caught a ride in a rented stupid-big 2002 domestic doublecab. How stupid-big you ask? We cheered to find it egged after the festival!
&gt;

Found it egged?  Is that what people are doing to big SUV type vehicles now????

Hey, just found out about an hour ago that I'll be making a fresno run next monday.  I have a load of robots and a complete conveyor system waiting for me. You and Karl up for an early dinner and a brew before I head back that evening?

Scott
