I've never been to Jerome, but dammit, I plan on going one of these years.  I think I need a Bus that runs, safely or unsafely, first!

I don't mind this thread at all, in fact I enjoy reading the opposing points of view.  But what I confused with, is where did anyone say they were planning on putting their Bus on the road, irregardless of it's safety?  I think maybe a few people have read too much between the lines.  Granted, there are *unsafe* Buses on the road to practically every meet and show.  I'm not sure why Jerome is getting this bad press as an event that draws unsafe Bus motorists.  I have consistently heard that Jerome is one of the more *crazy* meets (which is why I'd like to go), so maybe it is inferred that crazy meets attract reckless people.  Makes some sense, but I'm not convinced it's accurate.

Don't get me wrong, safety is the most important thing if you're driving the freeways in today's world in any automobile, but especially if you're in a Bus.  Hell, I even drilled holes (ahh, the flames) and welded in backing plates in my '59 Westy so I could install seat belts; like it's going to do a lot of good.  But let's not generalize about a meet and the people who choose to attend it based on the actions of a few people a year ago at an entirely different event just because it was in the same state.  Whew!
