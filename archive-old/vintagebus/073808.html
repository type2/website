Subject: Re: [VB] Re:Paintin' me bus

All this talk of painting has brought out the mother hen in me.

If you are going to be using any TWO PART CATALYZED paint product,
PLEASE get or rent a SUPPLIED AIR breathing system.  A mask will not
protect you!  You might not get sick right away, but eventually you'll
be toting around one of those little O2 bottles with a canulla up your
nose.  That is if you live!

Do some research on isocynates and see what I'm talking about.
