 Since then I've found a AM/SW radio that's actually switchable between 6 and
 12 volts, but I really like the look of the block-off plate in my bus and
 haven't figured out a way to mount it that I'm happy with yet. &gt;&gt;

speeking of radios, i have Telefunken that is also 6/12v . i was wondering if 
anyone has experience in the changing of the voltage. i went and changed mine 
by way of screw terminals that are movable and a diagram inside the radio and 
powerpack,but after doing so i realized there are also tubes and relay type 
things that are labeled 6v. will these need to be changed also?? anybody 
anybody anybody?...
