I haven't been junkyarding in well over a year so I decided to go do a
little of it today.  Took some pix this time too so I can throw up a quickie
website.

I had remembered tha a couple years ago there was a baywindow sitting at
Watts junkyard around Wymore, NE so I fired up the 67 bus and headed down
there into a direct headwind that was strong enough to hold flags out
straight from their poles.  If you ever want to determine whether or not
you've got what it takes to be nimble driver, you drive a split window bus
at stock height into a strong 20MPH headwind doing about 65mph and round a
curve that takes you perpendicular to the wind's direction.  You must work
at staying between the lines. :-)

After getting to Watts, I asked the guys if they still had a few VWs left
and they directed me to the east side of the yard.  On went the boots and I
started walking.  One of the old baywindow buses that had been there in the
past was gone but there was still an old brown baywindow that was a very
nice bus in it's day.  Automatic transmission, sliding window in the back,
2/3 middle seat, and nice AC ductwork throughout.  I poked around the engine
compartment and someone managed to remove the 3 &amp; 4 side head of the engine
with it still installed.  Geesh!
And thanks to Ronnie - he put up with me giving him a call on the cell phone
from out in the middle of a field to ask if this was a 2L.  The bus was made
11/77 so that would have been the first year of 2L production.  I'm hoping
that the aspect of it being an automatic doesn't complicate things too much.
After talking to the junkyard owner (Shorty Watts), he said his price was
$125 and I offered $75.  If I take it out, he'd sell it to me for that so in
a couple of weeks after things either freeze or dry up, I'll be heading down
there to snag me 2L to use as a core.

Right next to the bus was a row of 2 beetles.  One looked to be a flat
window super, a 68 beetle that was victim of an engine fire, and a 59 or 60
Beetle that was more complete when I saw it last.  Someone got the old 36hp
engine and trans out of it but there are still part to be gleaned.  The fuel
tank, metal coathooks, 6v motorola transistorized radio in the dash,
switches, knobs, integral rearview mirror and visors, steering wheel, fuse
holders, some interior goodies.  I was told $100 for the bug but I could
probably low-ball him on that too. I dunno...

I then took off and went to Lanham, NE and tried to locate a little 63
beetle I had seen there a a few weeks ago.  I guess this guy was supposed to
paint the beetle for his relatives and they got tired of waiting on him and
towed it back to Red Cloud, NE.  I had been told they wanted $3,000 for it.
The interior was totally shot, some floorpan rust, but the beetle was
complete and so was the engine.  To me, it seemed like a beetle worth $500
but beings this is the Midwest, the guy insisted that it was a &quot;special
year&quot; so it was worth more.  I don't know what it is but there is this thing
with people that don't know VWs to say that this VW or that VW was a special
year.  Maybe a lame attempt to try and get more money?

I headed home and got back 3 hours after I started.  It was a nice day
although a little windy.

I'll post a URL of photos here in a few minutes.
