Subject: Found that wallpaper

A couple of people asked me to forward the wallpaper and screen savers I was
looking for if I happened to find them .. well .. I found them thanks to a
list member.

look around at: http://www.aircooled-passion_dot_com

Actually, I'm not sure that this is the place from which I previously obtained
the wallpaper .. but it is the one I was looking for.
