Hello all,

My fuel line ruptured just above the nosecone on my DC, and with the price 
of gas these days, I can't really afford that to happen again.  So after 
crawling around under there, my fuel line from the tank to the pump 
alternates from rubber to metal like six times.  That can't by right.  I was 
looking through the online parts manual and didn't see any mention of the 
line.  Should it be metal all the way except a small rubber piece at the 
tank and at the pump?

Thank you again,

Alex
