&lt;&lt; &lt;&lt; It has always been my understanding that the crows feet rims were for 
 trucks, the non crow's feet for buses. No proof I guess, just what I heard.

 Hi Kyle,
 The problem with that theory is there is only one part number for the rim 
 used from chassi No. 20 - 117 902 (1955) on in our 1959 VW parts book.  Plus 
 there is no mention of what model used on.  While farther down the same page 
 there is the onamental ring for the 15&quot; rim and says it was stock only on 
 models 241, and 244 both delux buses.   Eric&amp;Barb
  &gt;&gt;
well, I have seen other instances where there are cosmetic but not precatical 
differences between version of the same part, and both version take the same 
part number.   LIke regular sliding window latches vs reinforced ones- both 
have the same exact number stamped in (as long as you compare R to R and L to 
L).  have seen early brake light decklid taillight with the same number- 
different cosmetically.  So not surprised the same number crows foot vs not 
crows foot.  Though the beauty rings are deluxe only and so are labeled in 
the P/L for deluxe by model number, and the crows ft aren't .. aren't parts 
lists neat?
