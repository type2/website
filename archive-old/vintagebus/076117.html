Subject: 1961 Double Cab... 07-30-03

I got insurance on the 1961 Double Cab and got the title changed over 
to my name. Also got it registered and got some plates for it. I 
mounted the back plate on the decklid but decided I'd go ahead and 
get some bumpers on the truck so I could do the front plate too.

The front bumper picked out for this bus has some nice size dents and 
tweaks in it. First thing I did was remove the mounting brackets and 
all the overrider stuff. I banged on it good with some heavy hammers. 
I used some wood underneath which dramatically lowered the volume of 
the banging. Also had a friend help hold it steady for me. I didn't 
get carried away. just got it back to shape and left the little stuff 
alone. I mounted the brackets back up and slid it into place. Perfect 
thing to do with a crumpled old bumper. Turn it into a blade and use 
it on a rat bus.

For the back bumper I've got an early bay bumper. It looks like with 
a little creativity it'll mount up and look just fine. I'm out of 
bolts and nuts so will have to go pick some of those up to get the 
front and back done. I'm WAY short on cash right now so have to wait 
'til payday to spend anything...even the few bucks for nuts and 
bolts. So maybe tommarrow afternoon I'll float a check and get 'em.

Still to do....

-get the truck inspected (gotta go during lunch break or get off 
early to do this part)
-remove broken hubcap clips from wheels and mount the new ones. Paint 
the wheels red.
-Wide White Wall tires (to be explained later)
-Paint flames and generally white trash the truck out.

The cool thing is that I can drive the truck after it gets inspected. 
So the other stuff is kinda just little cosmetic stuff i wanna do. 
I'm BASICALLY done with the truck. I'm gonna try to do these few 
things and then make the truck take the place of my old '88 Suburban 
that's being used for daily driving at the moment. It'll be ugly, but 
I'll at least be back in a Type 2 again.
