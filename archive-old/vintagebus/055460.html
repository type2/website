Subject: [VB] Re: new Coleman portable heater

Another alternative to the coleman is the little buddy heater.  A number of
us use it and it really heats fast.  The only draw back, it doesn't like to
work in the wind, so you can't operate it in a windy place, but in the bus
is just fine.  I run a long hose out the window, so I can hook to a larger
propane bottle outside.  My larger bottle is a 5gallon size and also runs a
couple propane stoves as well.

The heater works great inside the bus and I run it all night, the hose
through the window keeps enough fresh air coming in and the little buddy
has a low oxygen shut off sensor in it.
