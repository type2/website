Subject: Speeding, Cooling, and Over-reving

What you all don't realize is that I have dual external oil cooling.  I have an external radiator mounted on the left side louvers, and I have oil seeping out of every seal on top of the engine.  The oil atomized throughout the engine compartment is definitely cooler, though getting it to re-enter the crankcase has been a problem.

Yes, I branded myself on the dipstick at one stop.  I would love to have a tach, oil pressure gauge, and temp gauge and ammeter.  But I've set my sights lower... The speedo doesn't work and the fuel sender isn't sending, so I hear a nightmare awaits me (requiring cutting or something).  I read you guys discussing the sender replacement process before I picked up this bus and thought &quot;boy, I'm sure am glad I don't have that problem....&quot;
