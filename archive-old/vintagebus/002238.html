Apologies for the previous hacked up post. About half of my posts in recent
days have been bounced for being a non-subscriber (?), and I screwed that
one up on the first, second, and third try all by my lonesome. It's all so
confusing at this time in the morning, I'm not even going to try to fix it.
I have to go put some Prozac on my Cheerios now.
