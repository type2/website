Canopy Single/Double cab rear bows and wood slats - 175.00 What a DEAL !
selling the metal bows and wood slats for the back of your Single Cab--or
cut down the bows to fit your Double Cab. These of course are
repops--squared metal bows --very heavy duty--these were taken off of a
single cab--they fit very nice -- they were held by u-bolts -- If you want
you can drill the holes in the squard metal tubes for a factory install --
due to the size -- I would like to sell in the Phoenix area. any questions
