Subject: Poor Gas Mileage in '65 21
Date: Thu, 27 Aug 1998 20:13:17 -0400
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

Hi all!  I've tried this question off list, but haven't really gotten
an answer so I'll post it at the risk of sounding too new.  Does
anyone have any idea why my '65 21-window with a 1500 cc, recent valve
adjustment, recent tune-up, everything else pretty normal, original
exhaust,  would only be getting about 12 mpg? I've come across several
posts and articles saying the busses should get about 20-24 mpg, so I
am pretty worried that something's quite wrong.  I've checked the
odometer and it is registering correct mileage, and the gas tank
really is almost empty when the gauge says it is. Any facts I haven't
added I apologize for as these are the only things I know to tell you
as of yet.  Any help?  I'd REALLY appreciate it!  :-)
Thanks!
