&gt; Your message implies that you have no shims in place now.  If not, then
&gt; there should be no problem with the shims which are available in a multitude

&gt; one or two to get it correct.

Actually, VW specifies 3 shims only.  Similar Porsche engines use 1 shim,
so I suppose that it is a matter of how many different shims tha the
manufacturer wanted to stock.  I think that the original message implied
that the original shims were in place.
