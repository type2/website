Subject: Re: [VB] Drag Link 

 While you can replace just the short end of the drag link, I think it is easier to find a new entire drag link than just an end.   At ~$45, it is not a bad investment.   
 
Just make sure you make the new drag link the same length as the old one, and check for centering of the steering wheel before attaching that end, as the steering wheel is centered (or uncentered) by adjusting the length of drag link by screwing the short end in or out.  
 
Having a tie-rod end separator is really nice for replacing tie rods/draglinks/centering steering wheels.  This is a tool that remove  the ends from the spindle or swing lever or whatever.   Hazet makes a nice one, but the exchange rate makes them more pricey these days.  I heard that you can find a cheap ($10?) one at Harbour Freight.  I doubt it'll last as well as a Hazet one, but could save you time and hassle.  With one of these, if you get the steering wheel not quite centered the first time, you can pop the drag link end off easily, adjust it as needed, and reattach it.

Subject: [VB] Drag Link 


I finally check out the slop in the steering today. Dtetermined to find the culprit, I got my 10 year old in the drivers seat and had her turn the steering wheel back and forth. I soon as I got underneath my '60, I saw that the tierod on the drag link was moving all over the place. Can I replace just the tierod end? If this is possible, are they left or right threads? Or do I need to replace the entire drag link Thank in advance.
