Subject: RE: [VB] RE:1961 wiper connectind rod

Geez, you really know what you are talking about!!!! Thanks, I found the
linkage rod behind the kick panel and yes I am running 12v and I'm not sure
but I don't think there is a drop. Unfortunately I had already ordered and
now received the linkage rod from Wolfsburg West. Now I have an extra!

BTW, can I put a pertronix ignitor in my vacuum advance 231 137 035
distributor? I ordered an ignitor for a vacuum advance dizzy but it is for a
later model and doesn't fit because there is a ridge about 2mm high around
the base of the shaft. The technician at Pertronix told me they don't have a
kit for my distributor.

Thanks again,

Martin, Austin, Tx

 I need a connecting rod for the windshield wiper apparatus for the
passenger
 side in my 1961 DC. Are these hard to find? What year did they change over
 to something more like the beetle? Will it be easy to put on if I can get
 one? &gt;&gt;

did you find it?  they are easy to pop into place, sometimes they fall off
and are down under that area.  Do you have a voltage drop if youare 12V?
without that drop they can go too fast and that pops the linkage apart
