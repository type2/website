Just thought I'd say thanks for all the info regarding rewiring my
harness.  I'm still afraid to put her out of commission for god knows
how long.  I'm just hoping it will be running when I'm finished.  At
least its running now.  I'd hate to down grade to a mess that someone
else might eventually have to bail me out of.  I guess I'll just get to
know my baby that much more!  Thanks, JD
Oh yeah, whats the deal with those rubber cargo door stops.  They dont
just bolt on.  With slightest pressure the bolt just pops right out of
the rubber and I'm back where I started!  Glue?
