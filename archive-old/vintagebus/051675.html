COOL! I was fortunate enough to have my Westfalia in
the Patch Adams movie. It was a great experience. they
paid me for me and my bus, i went to wardrobe and i
was fed for two days! You have to look really close to
see the bus but it was worth it. The director even
came over (Tom Shadyach , spellings wrong i'm sure) to
check her out and let me go behind the cameras when
they were filming. All of this before i even had her
painted!

&gt; Hello fellow bus folk, I had the oppurtunity to rent
&gt; my '58 panel out this
&gt; last summer.  It was in 'Touched by an Angel'. 
&gt; Anyone 
&gt; see it?  Anywhoo, the only way I felt I could do
&gt; that was to use the moneys
&gt; recieved for fixing the ol' turdbus up a little. 
&gt; The
&gt; film company insured my bus and let me on the set to
&gt; make sure everything
&gt; went as planned.  Everything worked out 
&gt; pretty well.
