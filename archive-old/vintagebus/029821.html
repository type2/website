To your original question historically a &quot;Samba&quot; or &quot;Sondermodel&quot; in
German refers to the Special Deluxe model bus 23 windows, Sealing Wax
Red lower half and Chestnut Brown upper half, 51-58 model year only.
These are the true &quot;sambas&quot; as the factory has described. After 58 the
factory stopped using this term and color scheme. People have since
referred to all deluxes as such and I'm sure some will say any split bus
is a &quot;samba.&quot;

&gt; P.S.-What exactly is a Samba? I originally thought it referred to a 21
&gt; window or the like but lately I have seen it when referring to trucks as
&gt; well. Is this like an option package or something? lol. Seriously, I dont
&gt; know and was just curious. Vote me in for stupid question of the week, I
&gt; dont care! Thansk again!
