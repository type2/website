Hi Joe,
It did go through!  We just did not respond due to vagueness.  Are you 
looking to do really high RPMs, drag race or just daily drive?  For us daily 
driving is it, so single Solex carb and otherwise pretty much stock engine.  
Someday we want to improve this with a fuel injection system which results in 
better torque through out the RPMs and still increases MPG!  Dual carbs are 
much better for a bug or K Ghia for racing.
