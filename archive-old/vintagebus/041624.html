&gt; Well my new engine is in and purring like a kitten, what a great feeling.
&gt; Anyway the case is from brazil and it doesnt have a hole for the thermostat
&gt; mount, i need a bracket to attach between the 2 cheese screws,  has someone
&gt; on the list made one of these?   If so any suggestions would be appreciated,
&gt; a good pic would be cool , or perhaps someone could make me one for a fair
&gt; price?

You don't need to do that.  The casting is the same, so all you need do is
drill and tap the hole.  I did it on both of the Mexican engines I
installed recently.  

Cautions I have are to measure very carefully and
double check before you drill.  Measure the depth of the hole and make
your new one match.  

The first time I did this I drilled a pilot hole.
The soft case material made the final drill catch rather nastily, but
nothing bad happened as my cordless drill runs very slowly.  On the second
engine I drilled the final hole without a pilot hole and it went much more
smoothly.  

While tapping the hole, remove the tap and clean chips
frequently.  A can of WD-40 with a spray tube works well for that as well
as lubing the tap.
