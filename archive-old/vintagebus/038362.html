Actually...

IMHO .. the law is written without reference to speed limit in a VERY
intentional way.... to exactly contradict what you are saying.

The RVTalk list had a major thread on the whole topic.  I'm sure this
isn't new info to most here, but one point seemed to be under it all to
me... On the threads, references were made to several state laws
(different states) that actually define the concept in different terms
-- &quot;5 or more cars for 2 miles&quot; ....

I get the impression -- while not endorsing speeding outright -- that
these laws are suggesting (telling you) that if you are going slower
than &quot;average&quot; to get the hell out of the way.  Regardless if everyone
is going the legal limit or not!

The law actually supporting those who go 85 in a 65 zone?  Sure!

I further suggest that in a democracy you get laws where two factions
battle.  The slow people (us poor / anti-government in our low-end
German cars) trying to get laws passed on speed limits ... and the fast
(rich lawyers in their high-end German cars) who put loopholes in laws
to get out of tickets (ever been to Dallas Texas, billboards about &quot;get
out of any ticket for $35&quot; -- 10x worse than any such advertising in CA)
and they get the damn slow people out of their way!

Remember, police don't make the laws -- they often are impossible to
enforce with their paradox -- people make the laws.  Ah, a government
based on popular opinion and short attention span.

All in humor!

P.S.  Speaking on the anti-government thread &lt;grin&gt;.  Has anyone in
Seattle area heard if they are going to adopt the CA practice of
amending the emission law so that we aren't perpetually stuck with 1968
as the cut-off year for emissions testing.  Combined with the _15 day
limit_ to register and _you have to pass emissions_, I am stuck with
several $100 in not-registering in 15 day fines for the '70 and '71 I
have.  And I can't drive the things because of the damn emissions law...
I have to pass before I can get it titled.  Yes -- I'm working on the
technical problem that is causing them to fail, but if CA can change it
to &quot;25 years from present&quot;, what do we need to do to get King County
Washington to do the same?

&gt;As used in this section a slow-moving vehicle is one which is
proceeding at
&gt;a rate of speed less than the normal flow of traffic at the particular
&gt;time
&gt;and place.

On the other hand, the 85mph that the other cars want to go,
is NOT the &quot;normal&quot; flow of traffic.  The normal flow of traffic
according to LEO's is between the minimum and maximum posted
speeds, usually 45mph-70mph on the interstate, 45-55 through cities.
