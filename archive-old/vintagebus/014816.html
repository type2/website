Subject: the new bus?
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

has anybody heard if this project is happening? i have
seen a few scetches in rags and on the net, but not
really anything substantial. what do you guys think of
this? i can see where some might think it's a bad
idea, but i think it's a good idea. just as long as it
has the same amount of cargo area and as many
different options to choose from. there isn't really
anything new that can compare with the old aircooled
busses that we have come to love. i think a tdi bus
would be really great! 600-700 miles on the tank!
think of the road trips! oh, it just makes me drool
thinking about it.
