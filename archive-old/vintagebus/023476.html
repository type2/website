thom  i agree that giving credit where its due, and im sure the guys in the 
office that deal with costumers are helpful  and try to resolve the problem.

but for the moron that oked that to be shipped out their is no excuse( 
especilly with that kind of money involved.

i fully understand that it couldve been damaged before they got or on thier 
shelf
but still thier has to be some quality control of whats shipped to customers.
