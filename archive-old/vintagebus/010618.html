Subject: 15 inch rims
Date: Sat, 12 Feb 2000 17:07:50 -0600
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

im about to buy a new set of rims and tire for the 66 deluxe walkthrough bus
( that i bought for $50 :)), it has a 71 beetle 1600(from a baja i bought
for $50 :)) in it and it really moves so i really need to improve the
handling, so the guy at the vw place say i should get 15 inch/ 5.5 inch rims
, i read on the type 2 library website that 15s were recommended, but with a
185 tire, but it doesnt say the width of the rim, my wheel wells in the rear
were cut by the previous owner so thats not a factor, so im confused (im in
the dark because ive used whatever used tires i could get for years) and i
have 3 questions, ( 1)is the 15 /5.5 the best option (2) does the 185 fit a
5.5 in rim (3) does a 15 rim change the height of the bus or effect the
speedometer ? i appreciate the help!     One more thing , i just scored a 66
ez and a 67 double door, both in very decent rolling shape for $250 ,
wohooooooo!
