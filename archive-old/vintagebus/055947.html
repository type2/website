Subject: RE: [VB] Seals for the gas tank doors in the 66 SC treasure chest

hmmmm, that's interesting... no seals eh?  I could have sworn there were
some remnants of a black strip similar to the seal on the fresh air vent on
one of my panels when I removed it originally off my 59 dc... then again, it
could have been some black goo a PO put there...

anybody else with some insight????

If so we do ot know of any seals there and have none on our two 63 SCs.
Also
the bus parts manual shows no seals for there.
