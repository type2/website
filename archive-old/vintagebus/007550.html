It depends what county you are in. In Fresno county it is 7.75%, but in
Fresno city it is 7.875%

&gt; Well right away if it's 7% (I've seen this one) in CA you know it's a scam
because the sales
&gt; tax here is I believe 8.5% or 8.25%. Hell they're not even smart enough to
get that extra
&gt; percent outta someone buy finding out what the actual percent is.

&gt; &gt; What do you guys think about eBay sellers asking for tax on their
purchases?  I had
&gt; &gt; one ebay seller do that, and when I asked for his FTB tax ID, I never
heard back.  Sounds
&gt; &gt; like a good scam to get an extra 7% or better on the sale of your goods.
Even if you
&gt; &gt; paid it, there's probably no way to validate that it actually goes to
Uncle Gray, is there?
