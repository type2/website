&gt; &gt;Well, it looks like more and more things are unexpectedly (at least by

&gt; &gt;Anything else I should look out for??  I've GOT to get this truck

&gt; Steve,
&gt;
&gt; Two things come to mind.
&gt;
&gt; #1 You may now have issues with a stock exhuast lining up correctly.

.006 per side means that the engine is about .012 wider now.  That is not
all that much, less than half the tinyest (1/32) divisions on my trust
tape measure.  The normal tolerances designed into the tin and the
exhaust system should be enough to handle this.

If there is a problem with holes not lining up, look beyond the shimming
for the answer.  For example, Mexican mufflers don't seem to fit on
anything!  I have no idea what they use for a jig, but it doesn't have
much to do with a VW engine!

&gt; #2 You may need to shim you rockers due to changing geometry
&gt; resulting from shimming the heads. If you shim the heads.

If anything, you would have to machine the standoffs to get the rockers
closer to the head to maintain geometry.  Another solution is to use
pushrods that are .006 longer on each side.

The real-world solution is not to worry about it.  The difference that
.006 inches in cylinder length will make on the rocker geometry is tiny.
