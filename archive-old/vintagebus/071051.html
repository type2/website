Subject: Re: [VB] bus (still) does not idle

&gt; I'm running a 30/31 and don't have a idle problem but a starting problem.
&gt; It's like it's not getting enough gas and I have to pump to get it going.
&gt; I've cleaned it out and it hasn't helped.  Once going it's fine though.
&gt;
Ditto as well.  I have to give the gas pedal a good shot first to get it
started.
