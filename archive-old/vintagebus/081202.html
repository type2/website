Subject: 6v flywheel with 12v starter Q

You can use it if you use your 6 volt starter. Teeth are different on 12 
volt. 6v starter can run on 12 volts. Otherwise use a 12v flywheel. If you 
change flywheel, you'll need to recheck your endplay. Probably a good idea 
to check it for wear anyway while you've got it out.

John

&gt; I am gonna swap motors in my busses a 6v into a 12v bus. Can I leave the 
&gt; 6v
flywheel on? I know it wont work the other way around as I have tried it.
Thanks in advance.
