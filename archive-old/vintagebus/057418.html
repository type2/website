Subject: Re: [VB] 1/3-2/3 seat question

From what I've seen, the back is upholstered in the
same vinyl as the sides of the seat bottom and seat
back.

There is a piece of thin board under the upholstery on
the back of the seat as well. It's made of something
like plastic or tar board. This prevents narrow
objects from easily poking through the vinyl into the
cavity of the seat back, and (on microbuses - standard
and deluxe)it also serves as a foundation for the
ashtray mount.

&gt; Oh most knowledgable list...
&gt; 
&gt; I just picked up a ratty 1/3-2/3 seat and have a
&gt; question about reupholstery.  Did the back of the
&gt; 2/3
&gt; portion of the seat have anything on it, except for
&gt; the top 6&quot; or so?  From what I've discovered, the
&gt; back
&gt; was not covered with upholstrey of any kind, leaving
&gt; the springs exposed.  Since nobody really ever saw
&gt; this area, I would bet that is the case.
&gt; 
&gt; Also, are there any recommendations for restoring
&gt; frames?  Sandblast and paint?  Something more
&gt; detailed?  It looks like all the springs are in
&gt; decent
&gt; shape, but the whole frame on both seats is covered
&gt; in
&gt; rust.  Mostly surface rust, but rust nonetheless.
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; Paul
