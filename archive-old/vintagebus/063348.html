Subject: Re: [VB] [friday] 1 August

&gt;&gt; 1962: 200 mm clutch.  1/3-2/3 front seat.  Wheel arches lose their
&gt;&gt;       lips.  Total production to date 971,000.
&gt;
&gt;Ummmm.  Do you mean Aug. 1 for the start of the 63' model year when you
&gt;say 1962?

Right.  1 August 1962 was the start of the '63 model year.  I was
also generalizing to &quot;1 August&quot;; some years it was as late as 3 or
4 August depending on the calendar.

&gt;I have a '62 that has the hump back non split front bench and
&gt;the flat rear wheel arches.  I though those things changed in 63'.

Looking at it, I got the seat right but I screwed up the wheel
arches.  I said split seat and flat arches for the '63 models;
it should have been split seat and lipped arches for '63.
