&lt;&lt; I was basically an a$$hole for
 selling *my*, repeat *my* '56 Single to someone who will most likely
 send it overseas. I know this is touchy ground with alot of you, but &gt;&gt;

thats insane. I personally will sell anything vw (or what ever) to anyone any 
where. If that offends you, buy my busses quick, before I get the chance.  If 
the germans had that attitude, we would never have even had buses. come on 
folks, relax, these things where not even built here. I've even had people 
try to talk me down on a price by telling me they would be sure it stayed in 
the us. That sentiment doesn't put food on the table or parts on my keepers.
 
ronnie C, NOT ronnie in AZ or ron at bus depot, so dont flame them.
