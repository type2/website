Hi Clara,
We tried to copy the direct URL but can not seem to do that!
Go to Thom's vintagebus_dot_com website.  Look on the left side of the screen 
under the image of Thom's yellow panle van at items listed there.  Under 
&quot;Technical&quot; is &quot;Parts Manuals&quot; click on this last item and it takes you to the 
&quot;Obsolete Air-Cooled Documentation Project&quot; website.  Scroll down to &quot;Local 
Manufacture of Workshop Equipment gzipped&quot; click on this and when the next webpage pops 
up scroll down to &quot;652/4&quot; and click on the &quot;1&quot; to the right of that for the 
image of the first page of this item.  But wait there's more!!!   Lots more 
good info of stuff VW dealerships built for thier shops to work on VWs and lots 
more info in the Obsolete Air-Cooled Documentation Project!!!
