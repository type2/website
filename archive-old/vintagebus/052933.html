Subject: Re: [VB] UHaul Horror Story? [long]

I must be one of the lucky ones. In the last year I've rented a 26' truck, a
12' trlr, a 8'trlr and five tow dollies. Never an equipment problem and
always there when I've reserved them. Rented 'em on Vancouver Is,Oregon and
a bunch in Riverside SoCal. One thing that helps (so far) is to get them
from the company store, there a lot that are independent contractors
although in my case I've rented from both and not had a problem. Biggest
surprise was the last one when we discovered that they really didn't want
them to leave Calif. Paid 6x what I was used to, but didn't feel like
driving back to Oregon to pick one up. One thing to be aware of if you have
to cross the border, is U-Haul allows car carriers to cross the Canadian
border, Ryder doesn't and no one lets you cross the Mexican border with
their equipment.

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Call me Chicken Little but I made a few follow up calls to make sure all
&gt; &gt;was in order with the Uhaul agent that I am dealing with to actually pick
&gt; &gt;up the equipment and they tell me that they cannot guarantee that they
&gt; &gt;will have a vehicle/trailer available to me that I reserved.
&gt;
&gt; That sounds about right.  My U-Haul experience worked out OK but others
&gt; have not been so lucky.
&gt;
&gt; I live in Tulsa and the Bus was in Houston, about 9 hours away.  I
&gt; wasn't sure that the deal was going to go through until Thursday
&gt; night.  I reserved a truck and trailer for Sunday at a U-Haul location
&gt; in Houston via their Web site on Friday morning.  There was a notice
&gt; on the Web site that because of the short notice, I would have to
&gt; call them.  I gave them a call on Friday afternoon and they said they
&gt; would put the reservation in, but it would be a good idea to check back
&gt; with them on Saturday.  On the drive down to Houston on Saturday, I
&gt; called in several times but couldn't get any confirmation.  Finally
&gt; after I got to Houston Saturday night, I got a human on the phone and
&gt; they told me to go ahead and go to the U-Haul store on Sunday.
&gt;
&gt; Sunday morning we go to the U-Haul store.  There is a truck (bigger
&gt; than I requested) with an AT hooked up, sitting in the driveway.
&gt; I go in to the store and the guy there says, &quot;Yeah, sorry about
&gt; the mix-up, that's your rig out front.  We didn't have any of the
&gt; small trucks so you'll get that one at the price of the small one.&quot;
&gt; OK, cool.  He asked for my credit card, ran it, and gave it back.
&gt; I think he also asked for my driver's license number.  He then
&gt; handed me a little folder with a receipt in it and said &quot;You're
&gt; ready to go!&quot; I had rented from U-Haul before and I thought there
&gt; should be more paperwork.  I asked the guy about this and he said,
&gt; &quot;Don't worry about it, we just want to get you on the road.&quot;  OK,
&gt; whatever.
&gt;
&gt; I got the Bus, put it on the trailer, and hauled it to Tulsa without
&gt; incident, arriving Sunday night.  I had reserved the rig through
&gt; Wednesday, so I didn't have to unload right away.  On Tuesday I got
&gt; around to unloading the Bus, and I took the truck and trailer back
&gt; to the U-Haul store that's a half mile from my house.
&gt;
&gt; I gave the kid there what little paperwork I had.  He got the U-Haul
&gt; serial numbers off of the truck and trailer and tried to check them
&gt; in on his computer.  He said he couldn't find the record of them
&gt; having been rented from Texas, which was odd.  He tried to look it
&gt; up by the confirmation number on my receipt and found where I had
&gt; been charged for the deposit, but not the rental.  He went ahead and
&gt; credited me for the deposit and gave me another receipt, but still
&gt; mentioned that it was odd that he couldn't find the original rental.
&gt;
&gt; The next day I called the store in Houston again and got the same
&gt; guy I rented the truck from.  He said he couldn't find the rental
&gt; charge on the computer either.  He suggested that I wait until I
&gt; got my next credit card statement, and if the charges were incorrect,
&gt; to call back then - he didn't want to end up double-charging me.
&gt;
&gt; About two weeks later I got my credit card statement.  Deposit charged
&gt; to the card on Sunday.  Deposit credited back to the card on Tuesday.
&gt; No rental charge.  I called the store in Houston again and asked to
&gt; talk to the guy.  I was told, &quot;He no longer works for U-Haul.&quot;  So
&gt; I talked to the store manager, and he referred me to the regional
&gt; office in Houston.  I talked to a couple of people at the regional
&gt; office, telling them the story, and telling them that I wanted to pay
&gt; what I should for the rental.  The last guy, after messing around in
&gt; his computer for several minutes, finally told me, &quot;I've tried and
&gt; there's no way I can go back and charge you for that rental.  You
&gt; got a free one.  Thanks for using U-Haul.&quot;
&gt;
&gt; That was a year and a half ago and I haven't heard anything from
&gt; U-Haul since, so I figure everything's cool.
&gt;
&gt; One thing I will say in their defense is that their business is
&gt; different than others in the rental industry, like rent-a-car companies.
&gt; Most rent-a-car places only have one or two locations in a major city,
&gt; with several dozen cars at each location.  If one is broken they can
&gt; just give you another one.  If you asked for a Focus but they don't
&gt; have any and give you a Lincoln instead, you will probably be quite
&gt; happy with that.  Probably 95% of their customers know in advance
&gt; exactly how long they will need the car for, and bring it back at
&gt; or before the stated time.
&gt;
&gt; U-Haul, though, usually has several dealers scattered all over town.
&gt; There isn't a central lot where all the trucks are parked.  Usually
&gt; they have plenty of their two or three most popular trucks, but
&gt; special stuff like a motorcycle trailer is harder to get.  It's a
&gt; little harder to substitute things - someone might have rented a
&gt; pick-up because that big 24' truck won't fit where they need it to
&gt; go.  Also, I would guess that most people under-estimate how long
&gt; they will need the truck, and when it gets time to turn the truck
&gt; back in and they still have two bedrooms of house to move, they
&gt; just hang onto the truck.  I did this myself with a Ryder truck
&gt; when I moved once - there was a mix-up about the storage space
&gt; where I was moving to, and I had no place else to put my stuff, so
&gt; I just hung on to the truck.  Their tracking system is probably not
&gt; as good as it could be, but some of the problem is the greater
&gt; specialization of their equipment and the difference between when
&gt; stuff is supposed to be brought back and when it actually gets
&gt; brought back.
