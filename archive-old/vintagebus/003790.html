What kind of turning does this allow?  Seems like the bumpers would hit.
Even using a tow bar on my type 1 limited how sharply you could turn.

&lt;&lt;My father taught me a fun way to tow cars.....I've done it many times with
success.  Several bugs, a Fiat, and a van, are successfully where they need
to be.....all you need is bumpers (secure, of course) on both cars, two
stout ropes, and a rimless tire.   Tie the tire to the rear bumper of the
tow vehicle and to the front of the towed, and drive away.  The towed
vehicle will track nicely, and stops and starts will be absorbed by the
tire.  If you do this right, and don't do anything stupid like get noticed
by the ocifers, it is very cheap and in my experience, safe.  The tire must
be tied very tightly, for this to work, so it doesn't ride over or below
either bumper.  The longest distance I have traveled in this fashion is
about 65 miles.
