John,
I got a 1 layer cover from Motorworks for the 66 Westy and found that it didnt
keep the bus dry at all.  It actually soaked up water and held it against the
bus until the sun beat on it for a long time.  If it was cloudy for a couple
of days the bus stayed wet for a couple of days.  I am planning on spending
around $250 to get one of those cheapo PVC tubing and tarp car enclusures for
my bus.  I would rather have the cover not in contact with the bus.  I would
build my own, but I just cant find any PVC angles that would help me to peak
the roof properly.  It may be worth it, you decide.
One opinion in a sea of millions,
Dan Morris
