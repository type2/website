So, here I am.  Unemployed for the past month or so, with no prospects in
sight, and the money running tight.  I'd been sending out about two dozen
resumes or so every week, and so far only one interview that was pointless
to go in the first place, and nothing but responses form the consulting and
recruiting firms with inflated job opportunities, and broken promises. I
swear, if one more consulting firm calls me to tell me all about the 'great
opportunities' they have available,  they'll get an earful of the air-horn I
got sitting here at my desk.  I haven't been eating right, and for the last
week or so, I've only been able to sleep for about 20 minutes every 3-4
hours or so.  I don't even have a concept of what day it is anymore...  they
all just seem to run together.

What does a person need to get themselves out of such a funk? The answer is
obvious, a good old fashioned road trip in Das Bulli, and VW camp-out!  As
luck would have it, the Type2_dot_com 'Everybus' camp-out in North Carolina was
near!  When I first heard of this event, I had absolutely no intentions of
travelling that far, this early in the season, to a camp-pit I was sure
would be dominated by late-model busses and all those hoity-toity Type2 List
folks  ;-)  But hey, beggars can't be choosers, I wasn't doing anything
better, and there would be no 'Busses on the Blue Ridge' to travel to this
year...  I also had never been to my Mom's new house in Huntsville AL
before, and Dave Easterwood was nearly a straight shot East from there, in
Marietta GA, so this could shape up to be a goodly little road adventure.

The first order of business would be whipping the bus into shape for such a
journey.  My 1964 Turquoise SO-33 Hatch-Top Westfalia had been sitting up on
jack stands for nearly 3 months.  What started off as fixing leaky rear axle
seals, had turned into new rear brakes, pulling to tranny to fix a MASSIVE
oil leak, and so on and so on...  The front end was apart as well, getting
the Link-pins adjusted for probably the 1st time in its life, and camber
adjustment, etc.

On the front, I replaced both inner and outer wheel bearings with new SKG
bearings, and grease seals with NOS German units.  New brakes shoes were
fitted, and the backing plates and drums were given a coat of black paint to
repel the Evil rust demons.  I scavenged a pair of late-model lock-nuts from
a junker bus at a local yard, and used them on the front instead of the
old-style double lock-nuts.  Boy was that a nice conversion! A quick
greasing was done, and I also installed a front belly pan that was donated
to the cause by friend and neighbor Kent Zchoche.

With that done, it was time to turn my attention towards the rear...   The
transaxle has been leaking copious amounts of oil over last summer, and both
axles seal were leaky as well, ruining my rear brakes, and making the rims
look like 'Spirograph' gone berserk.  So out came the engine and tranny.
Man was it a ROYAL mess down there!  The entire rear end of the bus
underneath has a nice thick layer of gear oil, goo, and road grit all stuck
and caked onto it.  I tried every conceivable cleaner I could find, but
nothing even came close to putting a dent in the grime, so I ended up using
'Old Faithful'  the only substance know to man that can cut through 90-120
hypoid gear oil....  A squirt bottle filled with Gasoline.  I spent the
better part of a day under my bus in a rubber suit, with a scraper, brush,
hose and my squirt-bottle, cleaning the underside of the bus, and scrubbing
down the tranny.  Good news for the tranny however, I discovered the source
of the leak was not rotten axle tube retainer seals, but a torn axle boot!
It was just so dirty under there, I never noticed the tear before!  I
installed  a new split-style boot (really nice one made in West Germany, not
hose crappy colored buggy ones) and re-installed the tranny.  The backing
plates for this tranny looked like something found on the side of the
highway after getting run over a few dozen times, but in all my junk lying
around, I could not find another pair of 'Big-Nut&quot; backing plates.  Some
work with a body hammer, vice and creative jumping and stomping got them
back to where I think they can still be used...  of course only after a coat
of new black paint is applied  ;-)  So on go the new rear brakes, with new
hardware (boy were those new springs strong!!), drums, and got out the BFH
and wallered on the axle nuts till me arms fell off, installed the cotter
pins, and that's enough of that!

With the tranny back in, it was now time to consider engine options.  When I
first got this bus about a year ago, it had in it a 'fresh' 1600sp motor.
It ran great, felt peppy, stayed cool, however it had no flaps or thermostat
installed on it, a generator (which is insufficient to drive my Halogen
headlamps and stereo, etc.), and most of all, I didn't build the engine, so
I just plain didn't trust it.  I then installed the 'off the counter'
rebuilt 1600dp motor I'd been running in the now defunct Deluxe bus I had at
the time.  Well, a year has gone by since then, and the DP runs fine, except
for the fact that I hate Dual-Port motors, and I also had an opportunity to
meet the person who built the Single-Port motor the bus came with, and I now
trust it was well-built, and will provide many miles of service.

So I got work stripping down the DP motor, and the to-be-used SP motor.  I
cleaned up a set of tin, choosing most of it from the original pieces from
the original motor from my Deluxe.  Cleaned em' up in the parts washer,
sanded everything down, and scrubbed it all once more with mild soapy water.
Once that was dry, I shot on a coat of Rust-Oleum 'Rusty Metal Primer' and
let that dry. ( that took about 24 hours alone!)  While that was going on, I
sand blasted a nice set of chrome hubcaps I was tired of looking at, and dug
through ALL of my SP intake manifolds before I found one with a clear
heat-riser tube.  The hubcaps and intake I painted 'Smoke gray' which was
closest thing I could find to that flat VW primer-like gray color. Shot a
coat of it onto the muffler for good measure also.  Once the primer on the
tin was dry, a quick once-over with some fine steel wool was all I did to
prep it further, and everything was painted a semi-gloss black.  And while
that was drying, I cleaned up the long-block, and began fitting the
Alternator stand, fuel pump, oil cooler, etc, to the motor.  I opted to use
the original style 'upright' oil cooler on the motor instead of the later
'dog house' style.  While the dog house style does indeed cool better, I
think an upright cooler does just fine with a bone-stock Single-port... it
ain't like I'm gonna be racing the thing, right?

I then dug through the Big Box of Thermostat Parts, given to me by one of my
dune-buggy friends (thermostats are for QUEERS! Type o' guy he is..).  After
a bit of digging, I managed to piece together a complete set of flaps,
linkage, pull-rod, and return spring set.  I cleaned 'em up in the parts
washer, greased up the joints, and installed them in the fan housing.  It
took some tweaking, but I was very careful to ensure smooth, flawless
operation of the flaps...  we don't want this baby burnin up due to stuck
flaps now do we?  The pull-rod was pretty bent however, and I had to smash
it down in a bench vice to get it straight.  The first problem I encountered
however came about when I bolted the alternator to the fan housing... the
fan was scraping on the back  of the housing like a mad thing! I was using a
later, thick fan on it, but I thought those were backwards-compatible?
Closer inspection revealed that the fan was warped a bit, and the alternator
backing plate did not appear to be true as well.  So, for the next few hours
I got to play 'musical fans' with the sucker, until I found a
backing-plate/fan combo that wouldn't scrape on the housing. Whew!  This is
getting to be too much like work!  The second problem came along when I
discovered that the cylinder head tin I chose did not have any provisions
for the rods of the flap assemblies to sit down into them, thus preventing
full seating of the fan housing.  I had to cut 4 small channels in to the
head tin for the rods to rest down into to get the fan shroud to seat
completely down on the engine.  The next problem I encountered was that the
rear tin I prepped and painted turned out to be about 1/2 inch too narrow to
fit onto the heat risers!  I had to dig through all of my rear tins, before
I found one - the ONLY one I had - that was the proper width, AND had a
small hot-air intake hose hole on the LEFT side of the tin.  It was a
mad-dash to get this piece prepped and painted and installed before my
Saturday morning deadline.  I decided as well to take advantage of the
left-over paint and 2nd paint session to paint the stock oil-bath air
cleaner for use.

Now I was getting down to the nitty-gritty.  The exhaust system was next,
and I found myself less than pleased with the selection heater boxes I had
on hand.  After much hemmin' and hawin', I decided to drop the dough on a
new set of Dansk heat exchangers.  Had to buy 2 arm kits as well, since the
boxes don't come with any of the hardware.  Turns out the arm kits are about
as useful as a hole in the head.  The arms themselves took a bit of
modification to operate smoothly, and the retainers in the kits don't fit
over the posts on the new boxes, plus the kits didn't come with the
appropriate nuts 'n bolts to attach the little barrel-nut retainer onto the
bottom of the arm.  I was however, very pleased with how well the Dansk heat
exchangers fit up to the muffler, and connected to the little heat pods on
the muffler.. the alignment was nearly flawless.  My only complaint about
them is that the fins inside the box can't even hold a candle to the size
and quantity of original VW units.... But, it was either these, or old rusty
used junk, so.. pick your poison.

With the major components of the motor installed, it was now down to the
details.. and we all know who lies in the details  ;-)   fresh-air hose
gommets, grommet around the crankcase vent tube, plug wire retainers were
installed; ran the throttle cable tube through the fan housing, and secured
it on the back with a washer and hose clamp, and ran metal fuel line to the
pump, clamped it down to the fan housing, and installed the grommet to keep
it from rubbing on the front tin. The only grommet I didn't install was the
one around the warm-air intake hose, and that was only because the parts
house didn't have one in stock... its on order though, and I should have it
in about a week or so. I also glued a 17mm nut to the back of the engine on
the left side, to make installation of that always missing 4th engine bolt a
bit easier.

Before I installed the engine however, there was one more thing to attend to
in the engine bay.  Some dumb PO of the bus had ripped out the bracket for
the stock oil-bath air cleaner.  With that in mind, when I cut up my old
deluxe, I save a hunk of the rear deck with that bracket on it.  Using a
cold chisel, I removed the bracket from the old deck, and used steel
pop-rivets to secure it to deck of my Westy (I'm not special enough to have
a welder yet).

Next I installed the engine, hung the air cleaner, and did a complete tune
up on the engine.  She seemed to run real nice.. sounded great, and was VERY
quiet. Lastly I hung the rear bumper, installed the rear apron, and just for
a bit of show, I got wild and put on a pair of VW mud flaps I had lying
around the show for a while...

The Westy was ready to go!

It was now 8AM Saturday morning.  I had been working on the bus more or less
non-stop for 5 days now.. only stopping to eat and get a few cat-naps here
and there.  There was just enough time to shower up, and get in a few hours
of shut-eye before I would have to head over to Curtis's house to meet up
with him for the Kansas City swap-meet run.. my proposed &quot;Shakedown Cruise&quot;.
It would also be a Homecoming of sorts for mine and Curtis's busses, but
more on that later.

Stay tuned for Part 2: the KC Shakedown!   Blazing Saddles, a hurricane in
the Mid-West, and Blue gets new Wheels are all in store!
