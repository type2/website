As much as I would have liked to fix up and keep the
bus, I think it's going to the right hands.  This is/was the
'66 kombi with cutout rear wheel wells, flared fender
trim, air scoops, large rear tires, black diamond tuck
upholstery, dark red shag carpet, custom camper in
dark wood, you know way kool custom 70's bus.

I think/hope that he will keep it as it currently is,
a retro custom bus.  Hey, if it WAS customized 25 years
ago, can it be called retro? or is it actually VINTAGE custom?
My head hurts thinking about this.

glad you feel the bus went to a good home.  :|.   I'd say it's vintage custom
(seventies is vintage?  I guess so.  I've even heard of 'eighties nostaglia'
if you can believe that!).  If someone did that to a bus now it would be
'retro custom'.

my two cents
