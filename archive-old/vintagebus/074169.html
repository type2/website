Subject: Re: [VB] Full flow oil filtration vs filterpump

I put a cheap Taiwan filter pump in the mystery motor that now resides in my 
65 camper.   The oil pressure went UP dramatically, to the point where I now 
used 10/30 wt oil after it blowing the springed bypass filter on a freezing 
morning last winter with 30wt.

The downside to filter/pumps, is that the galleys are small, reducing oil
pressure, but usually not enough to matter a lot on a mild to stock motor. I
definitly wouldn't run one on a high performance engine.

There is one model of stock muffler that we carry, that puts the preheater
pipe on the right hand side, and clears the filter/pumps.
