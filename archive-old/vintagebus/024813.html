 &quot;Second question.  I'm going to make some curtains and want to find out
how they're supposed to be hung.  Rods, or maybe wire?
  TIA
Rebecca&quot;

Hi Rebecca.  My wife made great curtains for the Tinkertoy.  She used 3
circular plastic rings sewn into the top of each spaced evenly apart. 
She also ran ribbon through the rings and sewed the ribbon to the
bottom.  Using plastic clamp  type holders (don't know what they're
called) on the ribbon, we now have curtains that go up and down.  Hold
the curtains up with screws with washers large enough to not pass
through the rings.  No noticeable loss of visibility and (I think) more
elegant a solution than curtain rods.
