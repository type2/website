well,  at first it was not even concievable that we would be needing the =
AIRS list.  when we downloaded the list for our road trip it was so we =
could find like-minded people to invite on the way to join us.  we were =
intent on seeing the RedWoods up north.=20
we just had a new engine put in, and expected it to survive the =
travelling, suffice to say the mechanic wasn't exactly what we were =
paying for...Matt and Mandy were the first to help us (driving 45 min. =
out of their way to rent a tow trailer and help us adjust the clutch), =
tom (who was contacted by an AIRS member) met us to caravan to =
Sacramento and ended up helping us with the timing, and 400 miles from =
home we were pulling the engine in front of the Hearst castle (in san =
simean) with AIRS members Tristan and Erin....=20
a five day vacation, three of which broken down, but in the end we saw =
the trees...it truely was a pilgrimage to change our lives...i would =
have never imagined total strangers could still open their arms to be =
there for one another...we saw the best of both God's work and =
People's...=20
to all those out there who helped, our thanks every night before =
sleep...=20
the pictures are going to be incredible...and when they get back expect =
to see them posted...=20
much love to everyone=20
Jessica and Craig=20
