I have to agree with ronnie... and am impressed. I was thinking about
some kind of cover for the shock, since all kinds of road crud will get
collected in there faster with the shocks upside down...
	...but, I didn't think about the shock-damping being any different.
good critical thinking...
	At the very least, I'd use the innertube idea... an esc*rt I had to put
struts on had some nice-looking rubber protectors for the rear struts...
just the ticket, IMHO, for the bus.

... an old bike inner
