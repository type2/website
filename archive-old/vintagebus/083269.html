Subject: Re: [VB] Re: Dizzy overhaul?

From dogsbody:

&gt; Thanks for the replies John and Karl.
 I don't want to split hairs, just have the correct distributor for my
 application (1600 DP, 34 PICT carb, mountainous driving, RGBs still
 fitted)...preferably with out a hesitation when I apply throttle.  I've
 learned from my other bus (77 type 2) not to take things for granted!

 I want the vacuum retard feature if possible as I will be driving this bus in the British Columbia mountains,
I want at least a vacuum advance as there is a hesitation in the engine without vacuum advance (34 PICT carb).
The 1700 dizzy (it's a 205E) is pretty darn close to the 74 Beetle dizzy.  Should if I go back to the 205E,
should I set the timing to the 5 degrees ATDC of the 1700 type IV from which it came, to 7.5 degree BTDC of a
'74 Beetle?

I am not splitting hairs but I don't know why you said that. I tried to answer your question with the info YOU
supplied. I said you had a 021N because you said: &quot;Would I set the 1700 dizzy at the 1600DP 5 degrees
ATDC, or 10 degrees ATDC for the 1700?&quot;
Now you say &quot;should I set the timing to the 5 degrees ATDC of the 1700 type IV from which it came&quot;.
This is a good example of not giving enough info and then you pick on the people suppling an answer??  AND you
sent the frigging link of the dizzy you were referring to. It is still down below from you post!!!

The 021N times at 10 after and the 021E times at 5 after WITH VACUUM RETARD CONNECTED AND WORKING AT IDLE.



&gt; Another thought is that I should perhaps use the 71 bus dizzy which has a significantly more conservative
timing and advance/retard curves (This engine is IRS while my bus still has the RGB's).

GOOD luck finding one with a good vacuum unit.

&gt; If I keep the 74 Beetl;e dizzy, I'll need to source a replacement vacuum/retard can for it...the dizzy holds
dwell perfectly but the can's
diaphragm blew :(

Wells makes a cheap replacement. Richard Atwell has posted the number a bunch of times.

&gt; So many questions...thanks for the assistance and patience!
