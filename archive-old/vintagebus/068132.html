Hi Dave,
Pickle forks are a rotten tool for the job.  Get the proper tool to press the 
tie rod ends out will in the long run save you $$ by not destroying good tie 
rod ends.  Hammering really hard for long periods is not a good thing for the 
innerds of the steering box!  Barring having the proper tool, hammering just 
a few times on the side of the hole that the tie rod ends go through, has 
except for once, popped loose the tapered tie rod ends from the tapered holes 
due to slight flexing like ringing a bell.  When putting the tie rod ends 
back in make sure to slightly coat them with grease to prevent future 
sticking/rusting.
