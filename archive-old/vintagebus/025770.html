Subject: '66 deluxe for sale
Message-ID: &lt;37F53A82.58FA934A_at_gridusa_dot_net&gt;

I have a 1966 non-sunroof deluxe microbus for sale.  I've owned it for
about a year and a half and the time has come to let it go.  It looks
pretty bad(some rust), was hit in the nose, but is good for running
around town.  Engine seems to run strong but has a few oil leaks.  I
live in North Carolina near Charlotte.  Wouldn't hesitate to drive it a
hundred miles or so. Asking $1200.00 US.  E-mail me personally for more
info and specific questions.  Thanks.
