Subject: RE: [VB] Torque hub king nut to 650 ft-lbs+++ ??


For the last 29 years, I've been using a 46mm 1/2&quot; socket with a 2 foot
bar, and a 4 foot pipe slid onto the bar. I marked the pipe for two feet
distance from the socket, as I weigh 120 pounds. I just ease myself onto
the two-foot mark, one foot at a time, and cheat a bit by bouncing just
slightly, and that's 250 foot-pounds, exactly! Works as well with torquing
up the flywheel nut too. The torque wrench for 250 fp costs too much (I
do have a 0 - 150 fp torque-wrench for all the other jobs though). Never
have had a rear seal leak, or any other problems with this method.

&gt; Torque wrench, a huge one. Mine is good to 500 lbs. 253 lbs isn't that

&gt; I wouldn't mind one of those Kymco torque multipliers though.
