I need a little help.  I'm looking into buying a VW that the supposed
current owner doesn't have any of the paperwork.  To my knowledge, I
need the VIN so I can find out (from the DMV) who really owns the car or
to find out if it is stolen. Right???  Is there anything else I need to
look into.  Oh Yeah, this is the California DMV.

Aaron,


I've had pretty good luck with the California DMV.  A couple years ago, I
had too much time on my hand so I decided to check the status of all the
cars that I had sold over the last ten years.  I called up and it wasn't too
bad.  From that experience, I picked up a few keen insights to the workings
of the DMV.

**Make sure you have the info they want.**
**Make it so that all they have to say is *yes* or *no* and not have to
delve into potentially private information areas.**

SO I bet if you want to check if it's stolen, get the Supposed owners name,
VIN and the license plate number.

Goto (or call) the DMV and say do these match?  If they say no, then the
&quot;owner&quot; needs to do some 'splain'n to do'.

Usually this approach to the DMV works.  If you already have information for
them to verify.  Then they aren't divulging information.

They do have other procedures if you want to find a true registered owner,
but that's a different story.

Actually, the best bet is to ask them for the right procedure.  **ALWAYS**
get a name of who gives you that info.  Then they can go back to that person
to verify.
