&gt; setup?

I had a 67 21 window with a 2275 a few years back.  I didn't do a lot of
long-distance driving but it never even got hot (210 tops).  It had a
4.12 with a bug (0.89) 4th, but switched to bus 4th (.082) due to
screaming at 70mph!  I got close to 50K on that motor in my buses before
selling it.

As far as the 5 speed goes, I believe you have to dent the area above
the nose cone for the trans to fit.

There was a guy that developed a 091 (bus/vanagon 75-91) 5 speed.  He
sold a few to the class offroad guys and one to a bay window guy that
drove to TX from LA a lot.  He told me $2500 (which I paid), but never
did see it.  He still builds all my trannies, but I still wish I had
that 5 speed.
