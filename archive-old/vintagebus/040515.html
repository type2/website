Hey:

I thought most of you Vintage Bus and Type 2 list guys believed that the
online auction of VW parts was evil. I know a few people banished from the 
Type 2 list for even mentioning such a thing.

Are you guys finally warming up to the idea of capitalism?

By the way, your auction site looks pretty good.
