&gt; up at a loss as to how to convert my bus from a 6 volt generator setup to a
&gt; single wire alternator setup (Alt. from a bug.)  All my wiring is stock
&gt; (except for Frank Hill's solenoid conversion - god rest his soul) in this 66
&gt; bus so if anyone can tell me in a step by step procedure what I must do to
&gt; convert over (concerning what wires to cut or connect where), then I'll make

Two wires, right?  One is a screw terminal, the other is a spade lug.

The screw terminal goes directly to unswitched hot (either to the battery
+, or to the starter terminal..) via 8 gauge wire. (10 will probably work
for a stock output...)

Now, if you look at your voltage reg fomthe old Gen.  See the little blue
wire?  The ones that runs to the front, connects to the Gen light.  That
wire needs to attach to the sppade lug on the alt.  Thats it.

Remove all other wires attached to the regulaor and gen.  If you find any
accessory wire s(ie, my so-44 interior light, and silver socket, are
powered by a wire that connects to the regulator...) then you will need to
find a new home for them.

thats it.

later...david
