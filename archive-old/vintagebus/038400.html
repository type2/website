We made it!  I'm in my living room writing this letter.

The list of Thank You's is so long that I have to organize it first.  Thom
did all the work at his place, so correct all the &quot;we&quot; references in his
letter &lt;grin&gt;.

We drove 51 to 56MPH the whole way, 60MPH when in city traffic (Portland,
Olympia, etc.).  Ran great.  I tried 60 to 65MPH one 20 mile stretch and
pulled over and found engine WAY HOT, so I kept it at 56MPH or under the
whole rest of the way.

Only two problems, both were the kinds we anticipated.  Looks like the bus
had a poor 6 to 12V conversion and fuel guage isn't working (or hooked
up?)... ran out of gas in Oregon mountains where we were using 2x normal
fuel (so caculations were WAY OFF for a 50 mile stretch).  No biggie, as we
had a 2Gal gas can on-board and filled it up and were off in less than 5
minutes.

The starter also failed right as we entered Washington.  I looking at it, it
too looked 6V and must have just been run too long at 12V, but I haven't
really researched this to be sure.  But that was easily overcome by careful
planning when stopping.  Make sure you were pointing downhill or on flat
surface and a simple push start had us going after gas stop and rest breaks.

I will be sleeping and catching up on other stuff, so won't be near email
until Monday morning!

Oh yha, this is the Crew we purchased... purchased it from a listee, of
course!

Thanks to all!

Stephen Gutknecht just left my house bound for seattle in his new (to him)
'63 double cab that he bought this AM.

We changed the oil and transmission fluid, adjusted the brakes, cleaned the
engine, repacked the front wheel bearings, adjusted the clutch, and putzed
with a whole array of stuff to prepare him for his journey.

Wish him and his girlfriend luck!
