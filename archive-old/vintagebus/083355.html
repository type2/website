Subject: Re: [VB] Soundproofing

Thanks Eric,

I purchased some Dibiten from a local roofing supply house for about $48
with tax. It's about 1/8&quot; thick and a square weighes in at 88 pounds. Is
that the stuff you are describing? It does not have a sticky back, but one
side has a very thin plastic film on it. It is meant to be torch welded at
seams. I am not that ambitious that I want to risk a fire inside my bus. I
do have a propane torch that might do the job however.

Did you stick the material directly onto the metal panels? Or did you put
some material in between?

BTW I did look at home depot and all they had was mineral surfaced roll
roofing similar to the unsurfaced material that I purchased.

Chris

&gt;
&gt; Use what construction guy use on roofs and it is available at any
&gt; home depot. It is 60 dollars a roll and will do every spot on your bus and
&gt; have material left over. It is the same stuff that Road kill and Dynamat
are
&gt; made of. They just put there name on this roofing product and sell it for
a
&gt; hell of a lot more. I use to do stereo installs and have had a couple show
&gt; vehicles. I wish in the day I new about this stuff because the audio
brands
&gt; cost you a fortune. I am using it in my 65 deluxe and it is as thick as or
&gt; thicker than the audio brands. It has a plastic backing and adheres with
&gt; heat like the others
