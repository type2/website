Subject: Changes to CrewCabs 1959 - 1967

I'm seeking some help understanding the evolution of the Split.  In
particular a crewcab.  Can anyone summarize general changes?

I'm looking at a 1959 Double Cab, and I'm curious as to how practical some
changes could be.  My goal is to make it daily driver suitable without
making it impossible to return to stock later.  Yes, I want to make sure my
changes are mostly bolt-on and can be reversed:

  1) Tranny top speed and how practical it would be to swap tranny out with
higher top speed gears (Todd Hill in Olympia).
  1a) Redux boxes -- what years are interchangeable?  What would bolt on to
a '59?
  2) Anything unusual in putting a 1600DP bug engine in this?  Is it frowned
upon to have to enlarge the 6v tranny to accept a 200 flywheel?
  3)  Brake parts and other stuff?  What years are of relevance
(compatible)?
  4)  Tail lights, head lights, wire harness, electrical in general.  What
years would I expect to be compatible?

Again -- If I get original stuff (like engine), I intend to store them away
and take care of them until I can do a full restoration.

Anything else I should be thinking of and/or anticipating?  The bus in
question sat in a junk yard for 20 years, and hasn't been driven for
decades.  Is a split this old difficult to find &quot;normal parts&quot; to turn  it
into a daily driver?

P.S.  Looks like Rex is the purchaser of the 23-window I posted about Friday
morning.  http://www.i405_dot_com/vw/Rex/ for photos of the bus!  I took these
at 8:00am this morning!
