Subject: whats this noise


HEllo list I have a question. In my 74 bay when I make a hard right I hear a
kind of clunk /click sound. Im thinking its the cv but not to sure. I have a
dodge aries that had a bad cv and it made kinda the same sound. But someone
said it might be the wheel baring. Any idead what it is ? thanx guys
