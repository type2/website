Hi All,

I'm new to the list.  I recently purchased/rescued a 58 Single Cab from
the desert.  It has some rust in the floors and needs a few items to be
complete, but is a great project.  If anyone out there has a rear view
mirror, tail lights, headlights, and a latch for the side door under the
passenger side gate I'd be interested in purchasing them.  Also, I'm
considering putting a 36 horse engine back in.  The pickup has a 40
horse that doesn't run in it now.  Anyone have a 36 horse in good
condition?  I'm in San Diego.  Thanks for you time.
