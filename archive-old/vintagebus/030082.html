If this is not a concours vehicle, your friend can probably save some
money by going for uncovered transport.  But don't be surprised if the
VW is covered with diesel soot when it arrives, and needs a bath in
degreaser.  For more estimates, a spot that has plenty of links to car
carriers is http://www.movecars_dot_com/.  Some of them give estimates
on-line.

For comparison, I spent $850 about 18 months ago, shipping my doublecab
coast-to-coast on uncovered transport.  That was the best deal I could
find after getting about 5 estimates.

&gt; San Diego to Chicago. He has checked out a couple of transport firms and
&gt; they want around $1100.00. Enclosed and insured.
&gt; Has anyone on the list had experience with this....He and I would appreciate
&gt; some words of wisdom on getting this done without unnecessary headaches. I
&gt; think $1100.00 is more than he can afford.
