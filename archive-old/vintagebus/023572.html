I guess with the way it was set up this year, you could of gone to the swap 
meet without even paying to get in, wish I would of known that before paying 
to go in. But there was some nice buses inside to photograph. What was up 
with that double door panel that had the roof cut off in sections? It was 
like a bad accident, you know you aren't spose to look, but you had to, to 
see what he had done to the poor bus. It did seem a little sparse, and there 
were some people not there that I thought would be.  I think the GGVVWCA did 
a fine job this year, but I would suggest putting the swap meet in the 
parking lot to the north of the park, not all the way down the hill away from 
everything. I know they didn't plan on doing this, but the weather made them 
do it.
