Hello,

I had a moment of dread this morning involving
oil and smoke.  Upon inspection I was relieved 
but still concerned and confused.  I have dual
carbs with paper filters, so the vent on the 
oil filler goes into a rubber hose and I guess 
through a hole in the tin.  Well this morning
the hose ended up shredded under the crankshaft
pulley, with a frightening amount of oil pooled 
on the pulley tin and on the ground.  Since it
was hitting my header, I saw lots of smoke in 
the rearview (how embarrassing for day one.)
At first I was afraid I might have a fire, but
it was obviously oil smoke.  So I figured I'd
blown the rear seal, or, oil burped out of the 
vent on the filler.  How the rubber hose ended 
up under the belt pulley I don't know.  I had
looked at it when I checked the oil this morning.
Good thing the pulley won the fight with the hose.

What's the right thing to do here?  (Aside from getting
a stock intake, carb, and air cleaner; I really would
like to give the dellortos a chance :-) Shouldn't the 
vent hose really go up instead of down?

Or, could I be completely wrong about where the 
oil came from?
