&gt;
&gt;I bought a new brake switch because my new master cylinder was exerting
&gt;too much pressure on it, or so I thought.  I ride my bike to work and
&gt;when I got home yesterday there she was, sitting under the carport with
&gt;the brake lights on.  I had to take out the far left fuse to get them to
&gt;go off.

If you put the fuse back, and pull one of the wires off of the switch,
do the brake lights go off?  How about with both wires off?  If they
stay on with both wires pulled off of the switch, you have a problem
elsewhere in the wiring - most likely a short between the two wires
going to the brake light switch, but also possibly a problem in your
turn signal switch or maybe the 9-prong box.

If the brake lights go off when you pull one or both wires, try
unscrewing the switch from the master cylinder and plugging the
wires back on to it.  If the brake lights come on again, you have
a bum switch.  If they don't, then the trouble might be in your
master cylinder - you might try bleeding the cylinder and then
each wheel again. 
 
The new brake light switch has two terminals, right?  Two-terminal
brake light switches connect both terminals with brake pressure.
Later VWs used three-terminal brake light switches to operate the
brake lights and the low-brake-fluid warning light.  If you have
a three-terminal switch and picked the wrong two terminals to use,
that might be why the lights are stuck on.

I hope this helps!
