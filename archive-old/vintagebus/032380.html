&gt;Man, and I thought the one that a certain SoCal parts miser had was
&gt;pricey _at_ $1000!

&gt;What did Dave E pay for his?  I may have to add a few $$$ to my RHD one!

A *LOT* less... but then I bought mine from a true bus enthusiast that was
more interested in seeing the seat go to the correct bus than just lining his
pockets like the clown speculators on ebay who don't even own a DD
passenger bus...
