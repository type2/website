I will add one small detail...what are you nuts? Driving a bus with random
brakes is bad enough but a bus with random brakes and no insurance. WOW!
When you say you have things more important than the brakes to take care of
I hope you mean like open heart surgery or something like that. Remember
things that make a bus stop are more important than things that make a bus
go. And try and save up for some insurance. I hate the big corporations as
much as the next guy but it is where we are at as a society. If you take
some one out when your brakes go again you can mess up their life and yours
for a long time coming.
Good luck my bus brother may the force be with you (you are going to need it).
