   Well, so far the concensus is that there is something wrong with the idle
   jet. I did use almost a complete can of carb cleaner on it, pulled the
jets
   and blew them out with the cleaner. I also went thru EVERYPLACE that even
   remotely looked like it might be a passage ( had carb cleaner in my face
   when they weren't).
   Thanks for the responses so far, I'm still working on it.
   BTW, for those of you who suggested a vaccum leak, nope, all connections
   etc. are good and tight, no holes where they shouldent be.

I hope you can get this one answered.  I did the same thing to one and got no
results.  It was, I suppose, a clogged passage somewhere.  I was successful
with one 34pict-3 however, by running compressed air through all of the
passages and it corrected the idle problem.  I think it is usually hit or
miss.
