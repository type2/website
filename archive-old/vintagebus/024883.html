Subject: FS in OREGON, '60 23 window, complete, $6500.
Message-ID: &lt;36F9BD86.28AF_at_peak_dot_org&gt;

For Sale:

1960 23 window bus. Very complete. Bench. All exterior trim, including
the enngine air intake vent slat chromies.
Very minor surface rust on correct bumbers, original paint needs serious
buffing or repaint. Sealing wax red and white.
Never been restored.
Needs sunroof material.  All hardware there.
Inside very dusty. Sat for a while. Panels and seats all correct and
accounted for, including chrome trim pieces. Need work, but not
terrible. Headliner remarkably good.
Doesn't run, but probably could if someone had an afternoon and a mind
to start it. Correct engine and trans ( I think).
This is not my bus, and although I took a pretty good look at it, what I
report is from memory, so if you are interested, and only if you are
seriously interested, call
Rick Crandall
541-836-2244, and tell him Jack Maynard told you.

$6500 will deliver within 500 miles. Farther delivery negotiable.
