I would DEFINITELY be interested in such a show! Sounds like a wonderful
idea!

&gt; Hey Kelly,
&gt;
&gt; If this were a perfect world I would have you doing a TV show for PBS kind
&gt; of like Norm Abram's &quot;New Yankee Workshop&quot;. Or that lame-o Steve Thomas'
&gt; &quot;This Old House.&quot; It would be really cool to look in on Saturday afternoon
&gt; and watch as you fabricate and install replacement parts for an old bus
&gt; cargo floor, or that job you recently did replacing the entire nose. Each
TV
&gt; season you could do an entire bus project start to finish. I'm sure we'd
&gt; have bus owners lined up around the block to have their projects chosen.
And
&gt; like &quot;This Old House&quot; the aftermarket suppliers could chip in with parts
and
&gt; advice to get their names in front of the show's viewers.
&gt; I don't suppose there's enough of an audience to make this interesting to
a
&gt; PBS producer but I'd watch faithfully.
&gt; John Flowers
