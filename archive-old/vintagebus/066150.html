Subject: Re: [VB] How would you write your bus ad?

1965 VW 21 (at a minimum) Window (holes) Deluxe - have all parts 
(located in more than 21 places) to complete. Mostly in primer (with 
some other colors such as yellow, baby blue, white with zebra stripes), 
have good sheet metal to repair doglegs and cut-out rear wheel wells. 
Front floorboard OK (for Fred Flintstone). 1500 Single Port 
(paperweight), 12v conversion - should fire right up (if placed on a 
BBQ pit). Only 150 miles (towed) on odometer (now disconnected) in 11 
years. Sears Roadmaster tires with 90% tread (but seriously rotted and 
cracked). Will need to be towed (try a crane). Have all receipts 
(somewhere). Best offer over $20,000.
