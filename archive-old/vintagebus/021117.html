Subject: Bus heating and propane

Hey all,

I spotted a small heater rated for indoor use that
seems like it would do a good job of providing heat
for my Westy. It's called a Portable Buddy and can be
found, for those who are interested, at
http://www.mrheater_dot_com/buddy.htm . It can be operated
with disposable cylinders (expensive, environmentally
unfriendly) or with bulk tanks. They do recommend that
if using bulk tanks to keep them outside the enclosed
area and use their 5' or 12' hoses to fuel the heater.
My Westy originally had a gas heater and there is a
duct running into the bus from the engine compartment,
so there is the possiblity of keeping a small 4.5lb
cylinder in the engine compartment and running the
fuel line through the duct. I'm wondering about the
logistics of that though (at least while the bus is
being driven), would it be too hot there for the
cylinder? Now I could keep it there while using the
heater and then keep the cylinder somewhere else while
driving, but where? So, the &quot;burning&quot; questions are:

1. Would having a small propane cylinder in the engine
compartment be too dangerous while driving? 

2. Is it safe to carry a propane cylinder inside the
bus? If not, where on a VW is?

3. Is it really necessary to keep the propane cyinder
outside while using the heater, or is that just a CYA
statement from the manufacturer?
