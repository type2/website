Subject: assult by battery

Here are some pics of the damage done to my sundial in transit.  Can't claim 
it because I didn't put it on the sheet before the driver left :(  I don't 
buy that, but might be cheaper to fix than the legal fees to persue.  Let me 
know if this something I can fix myself (I stink at body work)or maybe how 
much it would cost me.
