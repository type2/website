&gt; Just received a pair of supposedly NOS heat exchanges from the bus
depot,
&gt; the ones meantioned earlier that are much better than the DAnsk.
Shouldn't
&gt; VW NOS parts have VW part  numbers somehwere? And comparing them to
the
&gt; original VW set that came off our '65, the are pretty crude. Just
kind of
&gt; thought there should be a part number is the were NOS. Kind of
&gt; dissapointed.  Jim
&gt; 
&gt; I think alot of us who rely on the after market for goods&amp; services
have agreat deal to be dissapointed about. Case in point, door panels
for my 59 crew cab, from bfy. not cut square dont fit correctly.
