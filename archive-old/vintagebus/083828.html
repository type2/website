&gt; The color filters in my speedometer having long since disintegrated, I

&gt; But my question to the electronic gurus on the list is this; if I'm
&gt; running an alternator and replace the charge idiot light (2W/12V =
&gt; ~167mA) with an LED (&lt;20 mA), is this going to be enough current to
&gt; 'start' the field windings in the alternator?  Is there a simple
&gt; circut I could use that would allow me to keep the led while supplying
&gt; the stock current to the alternator?

My guess would be &quot;no&quot; since LEDs are low current devices.  However, there
is nothing to say that you can't run a resistor in parallel with your
LED/Resistor combination to bypass the required current around the LED.
A 100 ohm 2W resistor should do nicely.
