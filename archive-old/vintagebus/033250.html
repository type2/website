Hi Scott,
Best to either post the engine ID number or get a copy of the &quot;Idiots guide&quot; 
by John Muir.  As for the chassi number the ID plates can be unscrewed and 
changed so the best place to ID a bus is left of the battery and just forward 
of the engine compartment apron on it's right side.  The number is stamped 
into the body sheetmetal there.    Eric&amp;Barb
