&gt; My last car got 40mpg and so I don't know and don't want to know the
&gt; mpg of the bus. But could I comfortably sleep in the old car? No! Was
&gt; it stand out funky and a pride to drive? No! Was it a vintage bus? No!
&gt; (It is a 1983 D_at_dge Colt, a rockin' little car in her own right, but
&gt; you don't want to drive it any more than I do...)
&gt;
It sounds like you are describing my other car (an '89 F*rd) Festiva.  It
gets 40MPG with auto transmission and A/C; something you've gotta have in FL
during the summer months.  My '67 gets around 18MPG and I run regular.  Its
a stock (original engine!) SP that I rebuilt about 2 years ago.  It has
about 7,500 miles on it (after the rebuild) and runs as good as the day I
cranked it for the first time.  My daily commute to work is about 4 miles
and the bus makes the treck almost daily in the winter (cooler) months.

Alas, with the sumer heat and rainy season upon us, the bus is about to go
into semi-hibernation; I still take it out on errands over the weekend;
until October and decent weather once again returns.
