&lt;&lt; It's pretty inexpensive to get the old one machined. Might as well make
 use of the 8 dowels. Most aftermarket 8 dowels are lightened, not good
 for buses as much. For DYI, there is a tool to jig it and drill it, for
 like 35.00, or pay a little less at Rimco or elsewhere good.

I though the deal with 8 doweled FW is that they are matched and balanced 
with the crank.  The dowels are not exactly regular, so the FW only goes on 
one way.  FWIW my bugster has a 8 doweled crank and FW, stock weight.   I 
dunno if the crank is conterweighted or not.

Yes you can just use 4 dowels, or why not get them balance together?  I think 
they drill dimples into te eFW to balance it.
