Subject: RE: [VB] 62 twin cab progress and headliner question

mmm,

I don't think its Oz specific - South African Crews
are the same.  I think all RHD split crews had the suicide passenger door
until the end of production.....don't know why ... possibly
cos the rear cargo door on a bus provides the 'standard' part
needed and that just the way the 'hingeing' works out...
(although the front
cargo door on a bus would go very close to providing a 'standard' part
for a non-suicide door - the middle lip would have to be changed)

???????

&gt; We still have the suicide style passengers compartment door too!

Is that because Aussie VW versions were copying Binz in 1959? When Did they/
ever change over to the RHD regular style cargo door?
