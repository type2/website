Being we have been on the subject of fuel, how about what Grade of gas do
you use and what is your TRUE (a lot of dreamers out there) gas mileage.

ronnie

ps. After years of using premium fuel on my, Prescott trip I used regular
and didn't notice any difference in fuel economy and/or power. I knew I
built that 6.8 to 1 engine for something!

ok, here are the results of the little fuel filter coming apart poll, and
has it ever happened to you.  the responses ranged fron simple &quot;no&quot;'s to
long ramblings of how a fuel filter should never be in an engine
compartment anyway.
HAVE had one come apart---ZERO  (0)
HAVE NOT had one come apart---NINE (9)
HAD ONE WARP/SLIGHTLY MELT---ONE  (1)
A SOCK IN A MASON JAR----ONE   (1)
are there any other topics i could tabulate results for?  p-mail with
suggestions, and maybe this could be a weekly thing.  Plus, i thought there
were more than 11 people on the list, why didn't you vote?
Happy bussing!
