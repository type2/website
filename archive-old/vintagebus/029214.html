Check www.type34_dot_org it the type 3 karmann ghia registry. You can find them
fairly easy in the classifieds. I've been a member for almost three years
now and seen these numerous times for as low as $10-20 a pair and as high as
over$100 (crazy!) for NOS. Beware of buying from ISP as they tend to jack up
prices on a lot of common items and they are not the only source. Look in
the classified/private owners section. I belive Bill and Steves has a pair
for a reasonable price and you can get their number from the site as well.

&gt; Can someone give me an approx. &quot;going&quot; price for
&gt; these? Are they hard to find? Does anyone have a set
&gt; they are willing to part with? Thanks for your time!
