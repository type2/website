Subject: options for front disc brake on a bus 60,with a beam  66  ?

Hello

I just  got a 1966 axle beam for my 1960 microbus, but now i need =
spindle, and while im here im looking for other options too:

-i can just find standard used drum brake spindle for 66 or =
around...this is the cheapest solution

-i can buy disk brake spindle from Custom Speed part:
http://www.csp-shop_dot_de/cgi-bin/shop2/shop_main.cgi?func=3Ddet&amp;wkid=3D8887=
617206&amp;rub1=3DFront+Axle&amp;rub2=3DSpindles&amp;artnr=3D13229a&amp;pn=3D0


-i can buy disk brake adaptor from California import:

li&amp;Product_Code=3DACC-C20-4121&amp;Category_Code=3D02-06-01-02


i dont want to buy another axle beam 68+ as i poured my money in the 66 =
axle beam !

But the 2 last option cost more and you have to buy more part, but the =
Custom Speed spindle seems attractive because you have a NEW spindle =
just bolt on, then buy the caliper,disk...ect...


By the way, my 66 axle beam dont look to be ball joint, still link pin, =
but in the books they say VW went Balljoint (at the spindle an axle arm) =
in August 1965... im i wrong here ? my friend own a 67 and no ball joint =
either

Any people did one of the option ? can anybody help me get the best for =
my buck and roadworthy ?=20

mike
