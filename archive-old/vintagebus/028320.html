Subject: Re: [VB] First time painter NO LONGER!!

looks great. congrats. I really think just about anyone can do it if 
they take their time. Sure a pro will do a better job. More 
experience and better equipment is why. But there is no reason why 
you can't get something that is very close or maybe equal to pro on 
your own....and save A LOT of money. And that's really the key. When 
it comes time to paint it again in 5 years or so, you can do it 
yourself and already have experience under your belt. It'll go faster 
and look better.

  Basically like anything about your VW....taking control! That's why 
I chose to do EVERYTHING myself on my '59 Kombi. From paint/body to 
interior to engine rebuild. Now, with a little help from list 
members, books, and the net, I can pretty much handle anything on my 
VW but rebuilding the tranny. As I move to fixing up my next VW, 
it'll only get easier and have better quality. And so on, and so on. 
Before you know it, your a pro yourself!
