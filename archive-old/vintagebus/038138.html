I was EMTREEEEEEEMLY impressed with the steering wheel.
Im guessing this is the same guy out of torrance who handed me a flyer at 
pomona?
The grooves and detail was PERFECT.
The sample he had at pomona lacked finish work, looked like it needed to be 
sanded and polished since the paint didn't sit flat.
VERY impressive, a little room for improvement, and then you'll have my 
business.

&lt;&lt; I saw said wheel at the show.  If I hadn't known better, I would
have thought it was NOS - it's *that* nice.  I'll bet that at some
time in the not-too-distant future, someone will pimp these as NOS.
Just like when the toolkits came out a couple years ago.
