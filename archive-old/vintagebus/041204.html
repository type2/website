I went to that Sacramento Bug-O-Rama show today. In case you are
interested, a split window, reduction gear boxed, 1600dp bus (probably
as near stock as most of ours) can do a 1/4 mile in 18.8 seconds with
a top speed of 62mph. But I wouldn't do it to my bus. By comparison,
the souped-up dedicated drag race bugs were pulling around 10 seconds
and 100 mph.
