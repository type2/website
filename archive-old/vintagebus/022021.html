I was cleaning my newly aquired middle seat.  I traded off my old &quot;Fire&quot;
bus for the seat and some other parts.  I was looking at the handles on
top and wondering if there are any replacment to be found out there?
Mine are servicable, but dirty and a bit rough.  Has anyone found a
source for the rubber cover that makes up the handle?

I haven't heard of any.  Cleaning up the old with simple green could help
though.

  How about any
spare middle screw covers?  Lastly, i have seen some seat's with ash
tray's and some without.  Any info there?  How did it attach?  This is
for a full length middle seat for a 65 Samba.

ash tray came on the passenger bus middle seats.  kombi middle seats did not
have them.  (I believe)   thingy on the back for it to slide into.  haven't
taken one aprt to see exactly how the ash tray holder is attached.
