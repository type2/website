Subject: RE: [VB] KP - walking in

With the amount of thefts lately, KP will be prime this year for those that
have to park a distance away. They do have a few pay to park lots, but
people walk in and out freely and what does it matter. A friend of mine came
to Pomona to see me, was there 2 hours, went back to his VW and someone
stole his stereo! The thief did leave the pair of scissors in his VW that
they used to cut the stereo wires, he turned it into the police for
fingerprinting.

ronnie  never to safe to be sorry

&gt; *Fortunately* my busses/car are not up to par with Kelly Park and I will

in
&gt; those everlasting lines you all are venting about to get to the parking
&gt; area?  Thanks for any suggestions.
&gt; 
&gt; No matter what condition you bus is in, I think it's worth the $20 it cost
last year to park my DC inside KP, and not have anything stolen off of it on
the street outside.  One person's beater is another's treasure chest!
