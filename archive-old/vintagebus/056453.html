Subject: Re: [VB] Rap on distributors

Jim is alive and well and still adding to the site. If you go to his main
page, http://www.oldvolkshome_dot_com/index.htm , you will find more links. He
does need a few links updated, however.....

&gt; &gt; The Big Question: What makes a distributor correct for a certain year?
&gt; &gt; Is it
&gt; &gt; the case? Is it the number of ports? Is it the crank? What changes on
&gt; &gt; the
&gt; &gt; 1600 engine occurred over the years to require a different
&gt; &gt; distributor???
&gt;
&gt; To this day I don't think anyone has put together a better reference
&gt; than Jim Thompson did, it is referenced in the type2_dot_com Library and it
&gt; lives on here (also I hope someone is backing up a copy of it, all we do
&gt; is link to it):
