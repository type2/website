&gt; Are there any other vintage Westy owners that also travel with toddlers and 
&gt; therefore deal with the car seat issue?  If so, I'd like to hear how you 
&gt; came
&gt; up with seatbelts or other restraints for the child car seat.

Hi Joe,
No toddlers here, but we do like safety for any year passenger or driver!  
Best to visit a wrecking yard for a stripped out 1968-79 bus body and take 
hammer and chisel to cut out all the nut plates (6&quot; square around each of 
these) in the body for lap belts in the rear and shoulder belts in the front. 
 Also pick up a set of Vanagon retractable seat belts for your bus.  Then you 
just need to cut and weld in these nut plates into your bus and bolt in the 
retractable seat belts.
