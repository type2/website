Subject: Re: [VB] Oil Filtration Question

have a factory filter as they are called,   lyle sherry did these with the
help of the bergs.   first off there is no cooling blockage,  second if you
use the bosch filter as recomended there is minimal mess due to the trap in
the filter.  third do you know how most domestic oil systems work.  screen
in the pan like a stock vw,   bypass valve prior to filter &quot; like the
factory filter set up&quot;   so the filter wont blow up at cold start.   i have
had this set up on my 67 bus for a while now and like it.   why run a mile
of hose right next to the exhaust ???   if you have tried both and like the
remote better i say great,  but i have blown filters with the full flow.


was said &quot;Thats three problems from my perspective, 1 only filter hot oil, 2
&gt; some blocking or altering of the air flow, 3 you've got to cut the tin,
not
&gt; to mention the hell of a mess you've got changing a horizontal filter.&quot;
