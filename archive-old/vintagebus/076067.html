Subject: Re: [VB] mostly a motor

&gt;.07mm is .070 mm, and much more than .013-.015mm.

good point - thanks for catching the typo.

&gt;Where did you take that final measurement ?
&gt;If you found a better measurement (and procedure),
&gt;fitted the proper shims, installed the main seal
&gt;and torqued the nut, did you check the endplay again ?

checked endplay the same place both times... i have the official 
little doodad to check endplay using a dial indicator. checked the 
measurement 6 or 7 tmes, pushing the f/w in HARD each time. it would 
rebound about .01mm and come to rest at the same point on the dial; 
then i would give a firm pull.
after breakin i checked for the hell of it and was miffed to find it 
had opened to the limits. i understand closing up - esp if you don't 
torque the gland nut to full spec before checking the first time - 
but i was startled how far it had grown. i'm going to try and get 
more shims this week and drop it again to change back to spec.

&gt;Did you add a paper or metal sealing gasket
&gt;and not verify the additional endplay ?
&gt;Dave \X/
  nah, they weren't needed (or used on any motor i've tyaken apart in 
the last 5 years... do people use these things anymore, and why/why 
not?).
