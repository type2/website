Hi,

My 2 cents. When I was in college, there was a guy with a corvair that he
had water injected. It was a high compression ratio (whatever that meant)
and he said it increased power as well as decreased the detonation problem.
He gave me a tour of the system one time and as I recall it was a home made
unit and he had used rattle can spray nozzles at the carb intakes.
Thats all I know.

Chris
