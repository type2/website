&gt; Damn!  As far as I can tell from reading the local laws, getting the
&gt; permit for a sewer hookup in Tulsa will only cost you $50 or so.  

A big part of the expense for me is the fact that I already have 2
connections to the sewer; my house sits on a corner, and some rocket
scientist plumbed one bathroom to the street on one side and the
other to the other street.  I have to pay extra for a 3rd connection;
a 2nd wouldn't have incurred the fee.  As such, I also have to pay
$X/foot for them to tear up the street and run the line.

&gt; Fun fact: at $3/40# bag, $4100 is around 28 Bus-loads (55,000 lbs) of
&gt; cow manure...

Now *that's* a load of crap!
