Did it happen to you that it gradually got worse?  The tranny is a new
rebuilt from Transform, all looked well on the shaft.  As stated, this
has been getting worse, then finally, nothing.  I don't know when the
clutch was last replaced...  PO drove the bus 9k miles in 10 years. 
Clutch was before him.  I have a new one sitting in the garage, but I
know the main seal is leaking on the motor and didn't want to replace the
clutch till I felt like doing both jobs.   The day after putting the
engine in, I read an article about how bad the VW clips are for the
throwout, but I never had a problem.  They suggested wiring them on, too.
 If I have to pull the motor tonight, I'm going to... going to... well,
do it.  I just don't want to.  Thanks for your help, all.  Anxiously
awaiting responses.  (Computer desk is more comfortable than the
driveway.)
