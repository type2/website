     Well I have a problem and need some advice. I've been trying to get
 my old side mirrors off my bus so I an install new ones. I've been using
 penetrating oil for awhile now and things were going pretty well. Both
 mirrors were starting to move more freely and
 then.....................SNAP!  The arm on my passenger side mirror
 broke off. It is now flush with the hinge. On the bottom there is about
 half an inch sticking out of the hinge. What on earth do I do now? I
 just shot some more oil on it, but how do I get the darn thing out of
 there without causing any more damage? At least any more than is already
 done. I really would like to have 2 side mirrors on the bus before
 heading out to BNNTA in Sept. In advance thanks!!!!!!!!!!!

either you can tried banging it through with a punch, or very carefully 
drilling it out.

when I replced the drivers door on my 61 (due to impact damage) I wanted to 
have a mirror on there- so I removed the old mirror stuck in the hinge of the 
mushed door, and drilled out the broken off stem with the replacement door.  
carefully carefully, tried not to waller it out.  pretty much succeeded.
