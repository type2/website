&lt;&lt; The host had a stack of about a dozen rear pully shrouds for sale. Being a 
repair shop, I assumed they came off VW's they repaired. VW didn't put 
anything extra into their engines, so what is the function? These cover the 
lower half of the crank pully and humps over the nut.  Safety? Cooling?  It's 
rare to find flaps in a junkyard engine around here. 
  While we're visualizing that area, what would the function be of a factory 
looking hook mounted to the top-rear of the rear lower pully shroud? Too high 
to be a crank starter guide, about a 1.5&quot; opening. I found one on a '66 
standard. 
  &gt;&gt;

the little cover piece you can screw on so it covers the top of the crank 
pulley?  I think it just makes it a littletidier and prettier, and a bit more 
awkward to change the fan belt.
