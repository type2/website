Well...

3:00am.   Just got dropped off by the tow guy....

I tried to caravan with Rachel H. down to Lake Havasu and BBB V.

Everything was a go and we made it to our first Gas stop in Gustine.

But that's as far as I got.

Whilst looking at a map to plot our course, we were sitting there at idle.

Then, out of the blue...clackity clackity....

&quot;Thats coming from my bus!&quot; I said over the roar of 18 wheelers passing by.

Off goes the motor, and it never comes back.

I send Rachel off to contiue the journey and I call AAA....

Based of my observation, The intake valve on #4 has broken and is now wedged
in the head.

I cannot turn the motor past #4.

Darn.... now I gotta figure a different way to get to Havasu.

BTW, here are the &quot;blessings&quot; of the event.
Broke down in a nice well lit gas station.
Broke down within the 100 mile free tow from AAA+
Still got days to get down to Havasu....

Wish me luck!
