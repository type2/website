Subject: Jetting for Dual Weber IDF's

I am getting a new 1776 built for me up at NW connecting rod in Seattle.
Jerry the main man there gave me these sizes:
32mm venturis
f7 emulsion tube
125 mains
50 idle or maybe 55 if the 50 is too lean
His reasoning is that the 28 mm venturi makes the air speed to fast for the
carb to meter it properly. By opening up the venturi you can run smaller
mains and get a more accurate mixture.
Sounded good to me. I have not tried this yet. Does anybody have any input
on how this should work?
Thanks,
