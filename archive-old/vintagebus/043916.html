Re: Gas Heater reliability
I know of 2 VeeDub owners who swear by them.  Both heaters were dealer
installed when new.  Both have been kept up to like new condition.
I really believe that the asbestos tape covering the exhaust outlet to be
the most dangerous part of the entire unit.
These units do not run full time, but in increments of perhaps 15 minutes
at a time.  (based solely on my limited experience with them)
