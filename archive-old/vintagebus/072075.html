&lt;&lt; &gt; It really does sound like a carb issue.   do you have another carb you
 could
 &gt; put on it?
 &gt; Or swap the one you have onto another VW to see if it gives the other VW
 the
 &gt; same problem?
 
 I don't have an extra carb (yet) so the switching carb thing would not work.
 Is there anyone in the Spokane, WA area that is willing to come by and help
 a brother out?  I have beer (good beer)

I know there are a bunch of old VWs in the spokane area.   dunno if anyone on 
the list is, but I suggest walking up to someone with an old VW and just 
talking.  You'll find someone who has a spare carb or someone who knows someone 
who does or someone who'll test swap carbs w/you. 

It's funny the number of people who'll just start talking to you about your 
old VW.   I've met some neat people that way.  now it's your turn (?)

Before the VW internet scene, that's how I met VW folks.   You get to see 
who's driving what around town.  You find that you know the people you're waving 
to in the buses.   Next thing you know they're bring beer and their bus over 
to your house to work on it in your driveway.
