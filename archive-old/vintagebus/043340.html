&gt;&gt; 1.  Is it normal for the inner race to stay with the inboard bearing?
&gt;Bearing race no.

So the inner race is supposed to stay on the spindle?  Mine didn't...it
stayed with the cage and rollers in the hub.  When I took the seal out,
the inner race and cage/rollers stayed together and came out as a unit,
but the outer race stayed pressed into the hub.  Is it possible that
I've got the wrong wheel bearing?  I'm just trying to make sure about
how this is supposed to work.  If Bentley's will make it all clear to
me, please feel free to tell me to RTFM.  :)

Thanks very much for the answers!!
