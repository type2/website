Subject: More info, Engine seized

Hey Guys, It's me again!
So I spent a little more time on the 64 last night and discovered that the engine is not COMPLETELY seized.  It will turn almost a full turn, then stop solid.  I turn the engine backwards a nearly full turn and it stops again. Then, it can be turned forward the sam amount, etc., etc.  Does this give anyone any more insight on what my specific problem may be?



Peace, John Baker
