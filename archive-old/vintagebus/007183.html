Subject: front shock bushing - or NQ is the 'MAN'
Date: Mon, 18 Sep 2000 15:16:10 -0500
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

Well, I've been struggling with the bushing like thing that attaches my
lower front shocks for a while - on and off, but still I've been hitting
them with wd-40 for about 2 weeks - NOTHING.

Then I remember NQ's signature - about parafin and heat for rusty
fasteners - viola - 10 minutes and they are both off - now I just have to
explaing to the SO about what happened to her fancy red candle - maybe I'll
just hide the remnents and blame it on the dog!
