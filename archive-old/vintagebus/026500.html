I had one of these on my last Notch - dealer-installed and all that.  I
switched it to run off keyed fuse-box power - sometimes it would stay on for
no reason...

'55 Kombi   me - backing out; you - stop and wait.


The Thom sez:
&gt;This gizmo I just installed goes between the speedo and the cable, so when
you start going backwards, it closes the switch, which lights up the light. 
When you move forward again, it opens the switch and turns off the light.  I
ran a hot from the fuse box, to the switch, then back to the light, which I
mounted on the bumper.  I mounted the one light on the driver's side, just
left of the overrider.  I plan to install a second one on the other side.
