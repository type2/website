&gt; David W thinks that I should install the drag link myself ... says it is =
&gt; easy and I shouldn't have a problem.  ONE QUESTION to David W and the =
&gt; rest of you out there ... is steering REALLY the best place for me to =
&gt; start learning about VW repairs ?? Will I install and/or adjust myself =
&gt; right into a ditch or a wall ?

The place to start learning about VW repairs
is when you need one, wherever it is.
A drag link is a simple piece of hardware.
If you are about to go under your bus for the first time,
it would be good to take along a copy of the Bentley
publishers manual for you bus as Clara posted earlier
and identify the parts of your suspension, they all have names.
When you find the drag link, give it a very hard wiggle.
Compare that movement to the new drag link swivel ends.
After this, you will be the Drag Link Queen of Orlando.
You will have to do this job again in 2038 to keep that title.
