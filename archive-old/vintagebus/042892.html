Subject: found a 15-window!!!
Message-ID: &lt;Pine.GHP.4.21.0005021521260.26017-100000_at_raptor.csrv.uidaho_dot_edu&gt;


Went off trekkin' around the hills of Pullman, WA today and think I found
quite a score.  While driving around a side road I happened to look over
by an old brick house and saw an old bus sittin' next to the house and
thought I'd check it out.  I figured it would be a pretty beat up Kombi or
something like that, but as I walked closer to it, I was very surprised to
see it was a '60 or '61 15-window with jailbars intact!  It is missing a
lot of important stuff, such as taillights, headlights, bullets, both rear
seats, dash clock, and a couple door handles.  Also about five of the
windows are busted including one of the rear corner windows :-(.  I might
try to get a hold of the owner and see if I can pick this one up cheap
enough to restore.
