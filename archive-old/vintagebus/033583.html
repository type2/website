Subject: Get back at VWoA/recall
Date: Sat, 21 Jul 2001 11:05:59 -0700
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

    Being that VWoA is fanatically chasing down everyone and everything in
site that they feel might infringe on there profiteering, here is a way for
us to get back at them. Since these list are for older buses that all fall
within this recall, EVERYONE should start contacting VWoA about getting
replacement parts and spread the word to all other bus owners we know. But
wait is that good or bad, this would give VWoA a complete database on all
buses still on the road!

Here is the link to the redall info or scroll down

http://www.nhtsa.dot_dot_gov/cars/problems/recalls/recmmy1.cfm

then put in the year on the left box, (49 to 69 it appears) hit submit
next page pick volkswagen, then hit submit
next page select the only model choice (volkswagen) hit submit
next page, hit submit put nothing in the box.

then, after all that, voila this pops out:
