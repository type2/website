Subject: Re: [VB] What Gives?

Hi,

The subjects do get stuck in a rut from time to time. Just go with the
flow and you will see many subjects covered and recovered and
uncovered.

Subject: [VB] What Gives?


&gt; Hello to all,
&gt; I joined this site about a week or 2 ago.  I have already posted a
&gt; couple of questions here, and got some great responses back from
some
&gt; very caring and giving individuals.  People have gone out of their
way
&gt; to help with my bus questions.
&gt;
&gt; But unfortunately, it seems that most of the posts/talk on this site
is
&gt; about truck drivers, whether you like or dislike hippies, and 5 word
&gt; contests.  Is that really what this site was intended for?
&gt;
&gt; This is such a tremendous resource for people needing help, learning
&gt; more about our busses, and especially for making new friends that
share
&gt; a common interest.  We all have such a great thing going here, it
seems
&gt; a shame for someone like me, who is new to all of this, to have to
wade
&gt; through all of the flaming and things that have absolutely nothing
to do
&gt; with the purpose of this site, just to find out a little
information.
&gt;
&gt; Coming from a background in restoring Chevys, I can tell you for a
fact
&gt; that VW people are a breed unto themselves.  Chevy people, and maybe
all
&gt; other car people, have absolutely no interest in helping their
fellow
&gt; collectors, restorers, etc.  They keep all of their sources for
parts,
&gt; information, etc, a secret.  With those cars, it's every man for
&gt; himself, and if you can't figure your  problem out on your own, it's
&gt; just too bad.
&gt;
&gt; On the other hand, I have been restoring vw's for about 4 years now,
&gt; (I'm a 60's guy, having bought my first new vw in 1964, and have
owned
&gt; over 30 since then) I'm here to tell you that I have never met a
bunch
&gt; of people that are more interested in helping out others who simply
&gt; share the same interest.  I've met so many wonderful people with
vw's,
&gt; who are genuinly concerned with helping others.
&gt;
&gt; It's with that thought in mind that I am ready to push the send
button
&gt; on this email.  I wish people would stop and think about what
they're
&gt; posting on this site before they do it.  I'll probably get flamed by
&gt; someone for this as well.  If that happens though, maybe the person
&gt; doing the flaming would be interested in buying my '65 Chevelle?
