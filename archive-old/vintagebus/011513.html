&gt;Hi all,
&gt;
&gt;For lack of a better word, I have noticed that a lot of VW engines in 
good
&gt;running order have a kind &quot; chirping &quot; sound to them.  Does anyone know 
what
&gt;could be responsible for that good sound disappearing?  I recently 
adjusted
&gt;

Chirping VW's are the result of the original stock muffler. Using a 
diffrent header and or muffler will change this sound.
My bus's brakes failed a couple of months ago while I was in reverse, 
and I ran into high ground with the tail pipes. It broke one, and now it 
sounds like a chevy. 

Jason
