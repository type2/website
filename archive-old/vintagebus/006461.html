Subject: 36 hp heater box question
Date: Sun, 26 Jul 1998 11:03:09 -0700
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

Hello.  In my self-destructive, never-ending quest for 36hp
bargains, I found a pair of heater boxes that are different
than my current 36hp heater boxes.  They look like 36hp
heater boxes but instead of a circular connector going
into the stale-air cylinder tin (facing toward the rear
of the Bus), the outlets are oval in shape and wider.  Are
these 25hp or ?  They are in real good shape.

Thanks,
Everett Barnes
