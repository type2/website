Well, this turned out to be my best time so far in the past 7-8 KP's I've 
been to.
First off, we showed up around 6am to find us slightly in front of Thom and 
dead behind a freshly restored 54 23-window deluxe. Supposedly finished 
yesterday.
We all hung out and bs'd until almost 8 when they started letting us in. Got 
set up and hit the swaps quickly. Made a few quick stops and ended up at this 
guys spot. 
He was still unloading as it was early and I spotted a section of turquoise 
material pocking out. Upon closer inspection I see it's what I've been 
looking for for a few years. 62-63 full length middle seat in turquoise. The 
seat was so clean with only on split on the front seam. We hauled it out of 
the guys bus and paid for it quickly, it also came with the back seat kick 
panel and a later middle seat kick panel. I plan on cleaning the seat 
tomorrow and checking out how clean it comes. Now my bus is finally complete. 
Although I am still looking for one turquoise hand strap for the deluxe coat 
hook.

Spent the rest of the day hangin' out, buying a few more parts and toys. 
Finally scored the Tekno hook and ladder fire truck single cab I've been 
looking for for a long time. Good price too.

We caravanned home after the show with a few local barndoors, single cab, and 
two hardtop deluxes. That was an awesome caravan.

Hope everyone else that attended KP had as great of a time and those that 
haven't been should definately think about it.

See ya at the next show.
