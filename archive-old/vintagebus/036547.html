&lt;&lt; Well JP, i hate that you feel that way, what if when those of us in the 
east who fab parts didn't want to sell to ya'll? What will you do when you 
run outta rust free stuff? Or parts that you can't find that some of us make 
? Something to think about,eh..later grin,, &gt;&gt;


Kelly,  I've heard good things about you and your work.  It's not that I mind 
selling busses to individuals who are going to care for them;  it's the 
people who come out to New Mexico to scrounge up all the restorable stuff to 
sell back east at a profit, to the detriment of those of us here who love 
busses, and want to continue working on our own projects.  I've got enough 
projects to last a little while, but I'd rather sell some of the things I've 
collected to the people who want to get them going for themselves, not to the 
profiteers or speculators.  I own property in downtown Albuquerque that's 
worth about 7 to 9 times what I paid for it a little more than a decade ago, 
but I bought the place to live in, not to make some absurd profit.  I'd be 
glad to sell one of my busses at a loss to somebody who'd love it and care 
for it.  This is a hobby for most of us, and that's what's important to me.  
You and Ronnie in Havasu and others make a living off busses and parts, but I 
don't see you out here taking possible projects out of our area.  Your 
business, and Ronnie's, is to provide a service to those people who are 
loving and restoring our wonderful vehicles.

Thanks for listening,

JP

PS  Just because I live in the desert doesn't mean there isn't a lot of rust 
on some of my busses!
