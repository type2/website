Subject: Re: [VB] Another Bus Project

Tom,
  I've got a '79 bay hulking in my back driveway after sitting in other back yards and ranches since I bought it in late 2001. Tail lights came in from Brazil, tires and tent stuff from Pennsylvannia, misc. goodies from Karl a few blocks away. Oh, alloys from the Pacific NorthWest due in a few days. There's always something to do, helping a cousin with his kid's first Ghia, a buddy trying to sell a convertible, guys at work without a clue. It's all someone's project and sometimes it comes together for you. Hang in there and it'll get done. 

   -Harry

btw, bays hulk, splits wait patiently



&gt; My kids are gone &amp; I am still looking for it! The 65 Deluxe Westy? is still
&gt; sitting on jacks in the Garage waiting for new brakes-for 7 months now. New
&gt; engine installed &amp; running, but not sure if it will stop! Too many other
&gt; projects.
&gt; 
&gt; Tom Buese-do it while the new project excitement is still burning!
