Subject: [VB] help with trouble shooting


Hi List,
I need some help with trouble shooting a problem. I
took a trip to Hot Springs, AR last week to pick up a
scooter. It's 3 hours each way. Temps that day were
near 100=B0F. The bus seemed to run just fine, but by
the time I got near home it was idling faster than
normal and seems to have sort of a &quot;flutter&quot; to it. It
has continued ever since after the motor warms up.
Also, there seems to be a little less power than
before. It's a 1776 with dual carbs. The motor has
approx. 5000 miles on it since re-build. What should I
check first?
1. Valve lash?
2. Carb's?
3. Heads?
Any imput would be greatly appreciated!!!
Thanks,
3DPete
