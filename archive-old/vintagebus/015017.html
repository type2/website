Are you and the bus in NE still?  Where was it?  what
is it?  Always looking out and for other Nebraska
busnuts, eh NQ (and Terry Wolfe)?  

Oh, and Everett's site comes through again!  My Dad
successfully sold his low original miles but hard on
the body 58 bug to a very nice guy (from what I hear)
from Wyoming, who brought some bus stuff for me to
seal the deal (bus content).  Thanks!!
