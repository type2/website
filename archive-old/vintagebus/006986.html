The problem of using a bug master is it's bore. It is to small for a bus and
will result in a spongy pedal. It will work just as long as you don't expect
a hard firm pedal, how do I know, been there done that. The bus I/we (it was
a friends bus) has been driving with this set-up for over 2 years without a
problem, 30,000 plus miles in L.A. traffic, but I don't know (or ever asked)
if he has had to slam the brakes on and lock them up. Originally we also put
on anti lock up nodes (for lack of a better word) these were plunger type
cylinders that went in-line off a tee in the brake lines to prevent lock-up,
with these installed the pedal would go to the floor in hard braking, so off
they came and up came the pedal, yet still spongy and yet still goes almost
to the floor when brakeing.

ps. This bus also had everything NEW in the brake system.

was to use a rabit reservoir in a _bug dual master with the 67 rubber
grommets.
he gave me the used volvo reservoir for 5 bucks. If this works, It will
be much safer with just a $5 upgrade.
