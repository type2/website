Ok,

This was too easy! If you do not have a paypal account, you can in 
about 5 minutes and type2_dot_com has $5 to its name. I have multiple 
e-mail addresses. Anyone know if I can set up a separate account for 
each and forward the bonus money to Ted. This seems like a pyramid 
scam to constantly refer yourself and then send the money to Ted but 
if it works.........

&gt;
&gt;PayPal is your friend; if you open a new PayPal account and use
&gt;tedebare_at_one_dot_net as a reference, it gets you five dollars and us five
&gt;dollars as well. Even if you are utterly broke, not a dime to your name,
&gt;you can figure out how to donate $10 to the list like that. And later
&gt;when you get some money you can easily buy stuff off of Eb_at_y with your
&gt;PayPal account. Go to www.x_dot_com to get started.
