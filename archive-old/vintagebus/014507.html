Subject: Grease use du jour-engine lid latch
Content-type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII

The engine lid latch on my truck has been wearing out.  The hole was becoming
not so square as it should be, and the church key increasingly slipping.
Don't want to get locked out to engine compartment.   So I pulled the bad boy
off and tossed it.   Found another in reasonable shape on an old decklid, and
also pulled off the chrome church hole cover, tried to straighten the SC's
decklid where someone had peeled the metal back from around the church key
hole kinda like flowers, using  channel locks and a hammer, attached the
chrome doohickey (we're not worthy), and thoughly greased up the replacement
decklid latch , and made sure it moved well and smoothly, greased the screws,
and attached it.  Even greased the bit on the apron where it latches.

Clara
