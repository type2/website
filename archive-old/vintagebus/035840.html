&lt;&lt; Another trick to restoring the final shine, is to use Future Floor Wax.  
Spray on with an airbrush (if possible), then buff. Works quite well on 
plastic parts such as tail light etc...  &gt;&gt;
Hi Doug,
Good idea.  We like the Brasso due to it having very fine abrasive and wax in 
it.  So it polishes and waxes at the same time.  This is not only good for 
brass to keep it from corroding so fast, but also chrome and plastic last 
longer due to this protection.
