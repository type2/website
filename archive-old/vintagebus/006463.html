Subject: stiff front end, modifications and choices

I read the recent discussion of repairs for a stiff front end.  My wife, who
works in a pharmacy, pointed out that lots of men spend good money on Viagra
to create just this condition.

Regarding the sunroom and other modifications discussion I recall the
following old story:

It seems that this guy bought a brand new Rolls Royce.  Driving around he
pulls up next to a rusty splittie (I don't know if it had a sunroof or not).
The guy in the VW yells out, &quot;Hey, have you got a phone in there?&quot;  And of
course the Rolls does.  Then the guy in the VW yells, &quot;Well how about a fax
machine?&quot;  to which the Rolls driver, somewhat put out, replies yes.  About
then the light changes, and the Rolls speeds off.  But the Bus catches up at
the next light, and the driver yells out, &quot;What about a double bed?&quot;  Well
the Rolls dirver is embarassed to admit that he does not have a bed in his
car.

He immediately takes his car in to have a bed installed, queen size.  Then
he spends several days driving around looking for the splittie.  He finally
spots it parked next to the curb, with all the windows fogged up.  The Rolls
pulls up next to the bus, and honks several times.  Finally the Splittie guy
opens a window, and the Rolls driver yells out, I have a queen size bed in
here.  And the VW driver replys, &quot;You got me out of the shower for that?&quot;

Many years ago a relative of mine discovered someone scraping the McGovern
for President bumper sticker off the back of his vintage Mercedes.  In the
letter he wrote to the newspaper regarding this vandalism he wrote, &quot;I may
not agree with his bumper sticker, and he may not agree with mine, but I
will defend to the death his right to stick it!&quot;

Do you see the relevance to changing a classic Bus?
