Subject: Deluxe trim screws = interior screws?
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

I bought a set of Deluxe beltline screws at a recent
show. The guys selling them said the deluxe interior
panel screws were the exact same screws, except that
the panel screws used the aluminum washers.

I tried some inside my 67 deluxe and none of them fit,
the holes are about one screw size too big. Is it
posible that some PO drilled them out, or used bigger
sheetmetal screws, enlarging the holes? I have some
panhead screws about one size larger and even those
are too small for some of the holes. 

Has anyone retored a bus with this problem? What did
you do? Get bigger screws AND washers? Bore them out a
whole bunch and use the chrome pop-buttons like are in
the cab?
