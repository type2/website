slowed, but did not stop the motor. It didn't do that before. I was able to 
slow it further by turning OUT the idle speed screw (I think if I turned it 
out far enough, the motor would have died). Set the idle mix screw at 2 turns 
and left it there. Engine smells leaner, but now has an AWFUL bog at 
acceleration, will almost die if you hit the gas; once you are thru this, it 
will take off nicely.  this is in all gears. Made pulling into traffic scary! 
Engine ran noticeably warmer. I kinda preferred it running rich, but cool :P

Hi Craig,
Sorry for not getting back to you sooner!
Kind of sounds like your pilot and/or main jet is too big.  When you turn the 
air fuel mixture screw in all the way this should shut off the fuel from this 
area and the carb should not be able to provide enough fuel to keep the 
engine idling at all.  Your slowing the engine by opening the fuel air 
mixture screw probably is causing the air/fuel mixture so rich that the 
engine is choking on so much fuel.
 
 &gt;&gt;SO. Do I get a bigger main? bigger emulsion?  I have read (in the english 
VW shop manual) that the bigger #s on the emulsion tube mean they flow more 
AIR to the mixture, which would seem to lean it too much.&lt;&lt;

Correct!

&gt;&gt; Did you ever find out what the different idle/pilot jet #s mean, ie g65 vs 
65, etc?  I've got a day or two to play with it, but if I can't straighten it 
out i'll risk the rings by running cooler but rich w/ the other carb (desert 
driving, ya know!)&lt;&lt;

Never found out for sure, but think they are just the same.  Probably easier 
to not have to stamp the g.

Best way to figure out jetting in any engine is to install a much smaller 
main jet.  Say a 110 then experiment with smaller and smaller sizes of pilot 
jets till you find the size that runs the idle with the air/fuel mixture 
turned out 2-1/2 to 3 turns and shuts the engine off when this screw is 
turned in a turn or two back in.
  Then once you have an idling engine you can try experimenting with the main 
jetting.  If your accelerator pump is functioning properly and in the later 
34-3 PICT carb is adjusted for the proper injection amount you can then 
experiment with bigger and bigger main jets going from the 110 you just 
installed.  What you are looking for is a main jet that is just big enough to 
prevent that AWFUL bog  in the lower to mid RPMs.
  Once the pilot jet and the main jet are set properly you can experiment 
with the air correction jet.  Best way to do this is to install a air 
correction jet that is too big and then drive the Vw in the 2,500-3,000 RPM 
and see if the engine bucks/coughs.  Then proceed to install smaller and 
smaller air correction jets till this bucking/coughing in the higher RPMs 
just goes away and go one size smaller to keep it on the slightly rich side.
 
 
&gt;&gt; NOW - having read the Solex manual offa the docs project, I SHOULD have a 
120 main (venturi diam x 5) and an emulsion tube of 180 (main jet + 60); I 
have a 150 and a 170, but they seem high! I'm used to running 125-140s on 
emulsion tubes, depending on carb.  I am curious - does anyone run a 120 main 
with a 150 on a pict 30?  How about a 122.5 w/ a 140 or higher on the 30/31? 
&gt;&gt;

Unfortunitly you do not mention which of your two buses (The 65 or the 70.) 
this dealing with.  With that info we could give you a general jetting size 
your engine needs.  Jetting is affected by which type and year engine 
compartment it is operating in, by the type and year of air cleaner used and 
even by the muffler!
