&gt; 
&gt; Hello, All...
&gt;    I have a request from a good friend of mine who is stationed
&gt; in Corpus Christi doing Uncle Sam's business...He just bought 
&gt; a very nice VW 411 and is wanting to find a reputable shop that
&gt; he can take it to for service/repairs while he is there. Any help
&gt; would be greatly appreciated as this is his first VW(!) and he
&gt; wants to keep it in good shape.
&gt;    (He told me that he called the VW dealer there and talked
&gt; to the parts guy...  he said he knew he was in trouble when
&gt; he said 411 and there was silence on the other end of the line.)
&gt;    
&gt;    Bus content...   bought a sandblasting pot and I am going to
&gt; try my hand at blasting window frame areas...wish me luck...
&gt; 
&gt; Many Thanks!
