&gt; It was a joke, I say, a joke!  If a stout guy was leaning back against
&gt; an empty beer can, you might be able to crush the can with the
&gt; gut-wrenching acceleration of a stock Bus, but a rim would be pretty
&gt; hard to bend.
&gt;
&gt; *whips out the HP48SX*
&gt;
&gt; I can't find Bus numbers, but they're slower than a Bug, right?  The
&gt; 1969 &quot;Without Guesswork&quot; says a 1500 Beetle has a 0 to 100 km/h (0 to
&gt; 62 mph) time of 22 seconds.  100 km/h is 27.8 m/s.  (27.8-0)/22 is
&gt; 1.26 m/(s^2).  g is about 9.8 m/(s^2), so this is an acceleration of
&gt; 0.129 g.  You can probably create a greater acceleration than this by
&gt; simply sitting down hard in the seat of the Bus...

OH BOY, a physics discussion!  :)

Ah, but you are assuming that the acceleration is constant, which it
isn't.  If you wind up that engine and drop the clutch you can actually
break the tires loose for an instant.  Assuming a coefficient of friction
of 0.8 and 60% of the bus weight supported by the rear axle you get:

9.81*0.8*0.6=

*calculator not handy, bring up Google, cut and paste...*

 4.70m/(s^2) or nearly half a g!  Gut wrenching, yes, but not for very
long!
