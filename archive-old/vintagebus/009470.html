Subject: Looking to trade
Date: Wed, 2 May 2001 12:23:55 -0700

Hi,
I figured I would ask if anyone out there has a pre 67 sunroof bus they would want to trade for 
an original 61 camper. I am looking for a sunroof bus that is good condition and suitable for a daily driver.
 If anyone is interested in trading, please e-mail me privately at ztoa96_at_aol_dot_com  The camper is all
original and complete, but needs a rocker skin on the pass side and possibly a skin on the drivers
as well as attention to the brakes(maybe) as it has not been driven in 3 years.  The interior is all
original and in great condition. I am new to the list, so I am hoping this is appropriate.  I am located 
in the northeast.
Thank you,
Kurt Makoske
