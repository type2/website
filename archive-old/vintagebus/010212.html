The son of an old friend is in the San Diego area, and has some questions
about his '60 23-window bus.  I've advised him to join the List and given
some general advice, but am not able to answer his inquiry about splitty
friendly body shops.

His message is below.  Respond to him directly, or else to me and I'll pass
along your answers.

Thanks a bunch, folks...

Fred,

I got your name from my dad.  He says you're a bus guy like me.  I now own
my 6th bus.  The first one I owned was a '65 21 window.  Currently I own a
'60 23 window.   I am trying to restore it now.  I did much of the rust
removal myself.  I was suppossed to have a friend do the bodywork and
welding for me.  He had back surgery so now I'm waiting for another guy to
do the work.

Here's my question.  Do you have any good connections for me for bodywork?
I live in San Diego.  Also, I need to buy new rubber for the entire bus.
Any suggestions there?

Thanks,
Evan
