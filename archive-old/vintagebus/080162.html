Subject: Re: [VB] Old Panel in a field pictures...

Rex
    You might have been just a touch but if you hadn't said what you did.
You and I wouldn't be talking about trying to save the old panel. Hope the
search for the owner goes well. Keep me in posted I'll send you a concept
drawing of it when I'm done


Save them all and keep on bus'n
