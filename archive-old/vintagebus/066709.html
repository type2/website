Subject: Re: [VB] Heater tubes?

Gary-
I jusy hooked my heater tubes up last week. Mine came with stale air
originally. So I think my tubes to the front are smaller but I had a couple
of the plastic flex tubes (been in my stuff forever...new to boot) and they
fit the tubes perfectly. The o.d. of them were the same as the heater box
outlet o.d. which is the same size as 2&quot; abs pipe. So on the heater box end
I used a 2&quot; no hub pipe coupling to connect them. Tried to use the og
silencers and flex but the flex was too small. One thing nice about the
plastic flex tube is they are insulated better than the og set up. Heat in
VW ..... I ain't had any of that in a long time. And the no hub fittings are
available in step down sizes.

Also don't try useing radiator hose. I did on a '63 envemo 356 Super 90
replica I had because it was the only thing I could find that fit. Fired up
the heat and it smelled like a tire factory in the car.....lol.

Also if anybody is interested I have a scanned artical from a Haynes resto
guide on inproving a buses heater system for more output. Pretty good idea
there too. If you want a scan of it just holler and I'll e mail it to you.
