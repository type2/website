Subject: Re: [VB] Gas tank cleaning

I have done the muriatic acid. I have coated w/ Eastwoods latex-y goo.
Haven't done POR's stuff, but am thinking about it.

Muriatic acid and the Eastwood stuff did not stop rust from RETURNING; and
if you use the wrong type of coating, it will come off and gum up the carb
- esp w/ new gas formulas.
Powdercoating inside and out would be best, but $$$ and no one does it
here, at least; the PVC stuff basically lines the tank, and rust - even if
it penetrates from the OUTSIDE in - isn't going to get  in to your fuel
system.
That's why I am going for it when $$ is available... a sound tank that WILL
NOT send gunk into my carb for the foreseable future.......
