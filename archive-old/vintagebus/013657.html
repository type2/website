Thanks for writing, E&amp;B....

No, no - you're right!  Polarizing generators is an absolute necessity! I hope
I didn't give the wrong impression!

 If I can, I'd like to shed a bit more on this...

This is what I've gathered over the years:

The iron magnets in a generator in an ideal world will have absolutely no
magnetization when the generator is not hooked up.  They are supposed to lose
their strength.  The iron that is used is a low carbon iron with, I believe if
my memory serves me correctly, no nickel.  If nickel is in iron, it makes a
metal that will retain magnetization.

But we are not in an ideal world.  What happens is that the iron actually
retains a tiny bit of magnitization.  The problem lies in the fact that the
magnetization could be in the wrong direction.  It only takes a tiny bit of
field &quot;excitement&quot; to get a generator started, whether it is from the battery
or from the iron.  As I understand it, the iron magnetization that is in the
wrong 'direction' could quite possibly overcome the field windings (supplied
by the battery).  So even though the field windings is trying to set up a
magnetic flux - and I'm unclear on this - the iron is trying to set up an
opposite magnetic flux.  The more the generator spins, the more the opposite
magnetic orientation will induce itself.  The generator will in effect put out
a ground (-) at D+ and will instantly fry the voltage regulator contacts. 
This is what happened to me.  It didn't take long to burn up a perfectly good
voltage regulator.

What one is doing in polarizing a generator is using the field windings to set
up the proper residual magnetization in the iron.  By letting the generator
spin (which is technically a motor now) the armature is properly orientated
also.

I realize this may make many eyes glaze over, but I'm hoping that one of our
fellow lurkers out there who have knowledge on this could comment.  

Anyhoo, like I said, this is just stuff I've picked up here and there.
