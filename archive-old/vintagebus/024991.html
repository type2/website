Hi All:

I also saw this bus on Friday at Ecology, and while Mark is right, the thing
is virtually gutted, I was able to break out the hack saws and pull a few
body panels out of what was left.  The bus is I believe a '63 as the Vin
started with 921XXX (don't recall the rest).  The rear vents were &quot;Outies&quot;
(not &quot;Innies&quot; like post '63s?).  I removed the passenger side vents which
were in perfect shape as mine are alittle bent up.  The drivers side vents
are also in perfect shape.  To elaborate on what Mark wrote.  Both side
rockers are already gone.  The cargo floor is gone on both sides, but is
there in the middle.  While both front doors are there, they are alittle
banged up, have been drilled for truck camper mirrors that attack on the
window sill and the door.  The rear corners are in pretty good shape, with a
few dings on the drivers side.  The battery tray looks like it had been
replaced and was in great shape.  I removed both rear corners of the belt
line, but the rest of it was pretty much in tact and easy to access, as the
roof is gone.  Cargo doors are choped in half and will only make good
straight metal panels.  Nose is there, but window sills are a bit rusty and
the nose is a little bent (not worth it in my eyes).  Dash, is in excellent
shape.  Well, I hope that helps.

It was pretty amazing to see a split in a San Diego junkyard.  I almost wet
my self when I saw it and saw the &quot;outie&quot; vents.  Needless to say I had a
great weekend.  While easter was nice, I GOT SOME BODY PANELS FOR MY BUS.
YEAH BABY!!!!!!!

&gt; First one I've seen. I didn't notice what year, but here's the deal. The
&gt; bus is entirely in primer. No mechanicals, I think. All the pillars are
&gt; cut at the waist. 90% of the roof is gone, but it appears that the all
&gt; the metal around the windshield and the first five inches of roof are
&gt; there. Complete nose, but it's dented.
&gt;
&gt; This looks like a great bus from which to hack corners, sections,
&gt; whatever sheetmetal you need without guilt.
