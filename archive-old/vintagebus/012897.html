Since you are not going to be able to run the engine long
without fuel then there is not going to be much damage to
your fuel pump.  We have run out of fuel and switched to
reserve both on purpose and by accident while still rolling
with no problems or fuel pump failures happening at the
same time.
&gt;
I guess the point was that it could reduce the serviceable
life of your fuel pump.

I'd like to see someone switch a Barndoor to reserve while
still rolling, that would be neat to see.  Remove the
decklid, weld in the optional upper hatch and just lean
over!  Or maybe I'll try jumping out and running back
during the slow drags at Jerome.  Well, maybe not, I'd
probably lose control and send my Bus rolling down the
mountain...
