&gt; why do the old clips need to be removed from the rims? Will they affect the
&gt; sandblasting, or do you only take them off if they are in bad shape?

I have been told to remove all clips, good or not, because they are weaker
than new ones I can put on while the rim is clean and waiting to get powder
coated.  Most of them seem ok, but I figure an ounce of prevention (DM?) is
valuable.
