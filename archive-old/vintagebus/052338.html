Subject: RE: [VB] Wiring through bellypans?

Okay,

We went for it this morning and it actually went more easily that I
expected. The frame on a non-bellypan bus is only a &quot;C&quot; channel, while
mine was a complete box. We wound a sturdy piece of rope to the old
harness, secured it with a 1/2 roll of electrical tape and pulled from
the rear. 

It went easily at first, but then the wiring sleeve caught on something
inside the frame. I am glad that I tied the loose end of the rope to the
bumper, because when it finally came free John was pulling pretty hard
at it literally shot out of the frame. The new Wiring Works harness (top
notch, btw) went it very smoothly after we liberally applied silicone
lubricant as I pulled from the front. 

From there, we upgraded to a newer (&gt;'60) 8 post fuse block so I could
add a fuel gauge and foglights, which was time consuming but
straight-forward. Having the color diagrams and quality directions
really helped, along with liberal patience and occassional &quot;refreshment&quot;
breaks.

Thanks for the advice!

PS - The bus was straight from the paintbooth last week and we are only
a motor and sliding windows away from driver status. BBB, here we come!
Thanks again to John Howard, Matt Earle and Ronnie.

no. on a bus with belly pans, there is a metal tube that the wiring
harness
runs through. there are clips near the front axle and near the back, but
not underneath the belly pans. make very sure when pulling the old one
out,
you either have the new one attached to it very securely, or use
something
along the lines of an old clutch cable to route through to pull the new
one
back through. and don't get the wires too bundled up, or they won't fit
through the tube at all. it's not too bad if it does get stuck, because
it
is in a tube and really has no other place to run other than in the
tube.
and start at the front of the bus and fish it towards the back. it's
always
seemed to be easier for me to do it that way.
good luck. it's not really that hard, especially with nice, new,
flexible
wiring.

&gt; Ronnie, John Howard, Matt Earle &amp; I am working to replace my wiring
harness
&gt; this weekend and were discussing the issue of the securing clips that
run
&gt; along the frame rail.
&gt;
&gt; On buses equiped with belly pans, are these clips in place? We want to
make
&gt; sure that we can get the old wiring out (and fish wire in) without
breaking
&gt; it.
