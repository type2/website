Hi Kayabo,
You can find them here and the at the swaps, and JC Whitless has some 
availible.  Either will not be able to handle the amount of Amp needed for 
the gas heater though.  Best to just deal with a gas heat specialist, and see 
if they will trade parts with you, or just get the proper gas heater with all 
it's 6 volt parts.
