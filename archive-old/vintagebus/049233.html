I just posted 4 pics of my '66 WT kombi on www.thesamba_dot_com/vw under Campers. 

The wood is really thin, cabinet missing behind passenger seat. Sliding door on rear cabinet, z-bed of some kind. Rear mattress is glued down, but looks like it has newer upholstery. 

Let me know what you think it is. I looked at every camper at BBBV and didn't see one of this type or quality (or lack of quality.) There's a few gouges and dents in the woodwork.  I have other plans for the vehicle unless it's a rare spruce-goose companion camper or something. The woodwork will be available at OCTO next month.

BTW, I need wipers, outside mirrors, belly pan and pedal pan for my FM 23 Window. Hmmm, with great detailing and quality pictures, it may take $8,000 on E-bay, &quot;as-is&quot;? Just need some 1/25th scale Dead stickers and a throw-down account.
