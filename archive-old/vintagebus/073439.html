&gt; Don't use it unless you plan to keep your bus out of the elements. PPG gives
&gt; OMNI a 5 year life span. The OMNI on my 60 DD started to powder out and go
&gt; flat after 3 years, been 5 now and it looks like a 40 year old paint job,
&gt; really makes my bus look vintage though.

Ronnie,

Paint tends to go flat really quick when you never wash that damn bus =)

Come to think of it, has the DD ever been washed?  I remember being there for 
the maiden voyage of that bus......man, has it been that long already?
