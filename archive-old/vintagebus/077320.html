&gt; I wonder if that thing is authorized by VW . . .

Greg, you're sneaky, evil &amp; totally right.
Time to call VWAG's legal representation in the UK :o)
And as for oil leaks &amp; reliability, I wonder how many
80's Hiaces there still are on the road, let alone
anything T_at_y_at_ta made in the 50's &amp; 60's!
I don't know how many T_at_y_at_ta vans I've followed
running on 2 or 3 cylinder &amp; spewing black oily smoke
everywhere.
The nerve of them!
:o)
Cheers &amp; God Bless
