&gt; This makes my head hurt!....... I'm running one of those seedy looking

&gt; increase voltage). So if i swap my switch for a 2 speed 12 volt but keep
&gt; the old 6volt motor, wont i gain from a six volt supply feeding at position
&gt; 1 and 12 volt at possition 2? (or thereabouts)  unless of course i'm
&gt; missing something - could the resistance be somewhere else?

The resistance is in the motor. The 2-speed motor has a separate winding
(sometimes) or a different tap on the winding to provide a different
amount of magnetic field for different speeds.  The best bet to make the
ex 6V wipers work where you want them to is to use a rheostat
(adjustable resistor) to set the speed and change it at will.  OK?  Not
hard, but you need a really heavy-duty one.  Otherwise, I think RMMW
sells an electronic thingy for the job.  Never used one, but they should
work.

&gt; Glynn -
&gt; endlessly irritaded - by wipers that never run at the right speed. they run
&gt; like sloaths when cold then gradually warm up to a speed that misses the
&gt; glass.
