&gt;I don't get it- cut gaskets for a manifold?   where the manifold goes to
the
&gt;head it is a round crush o ring, or for a DP the metal raised squash
gasket.
&gt;to the heat risers I haven't cut gaskets, used the metal sandwich type.


I do it all the time.  I forget to order gaskets so I either make them out
of gasket stock which you can buy at most auto places or like in the case of
the reduction boxes on my bus, scan the part in and have your brother cut
the image out in gasket material with a vinyl graphic cutter machine.  Talk
about precision gaskets!

Those metal crush DP gaskets are the worst gaskets ever.   I throw them out
but save one for a pattern and use some nice thick gasket material so it
gets a good seal.  Making good gaskets is an art I haven't mastered yet but
it sure helps when you realize that at 2 in the morning, you needed those DP
intake gaskets...
