 Don't take my word yet. Just installed and will put to the test with the
1200 mile Kelly Park round trip run. Seems very good so far. Messed with
timing today on way home from work. Was 101 degrees today in havasu. I time
my motors by the pinging method. advance till pings, then back off. Did this
up the hill after work and adjusted a few times and got it. i know most of
you will freek at this method, but what is better than driving to test. My
temp gauge is spit on the block and grabing the dip stick. Has worked for
years. No flames as we have covered this before. Anyway wait till after the
KP run on the vac 009 and see what I get. Had a solid 20/21 MPG on the 600
mile Phoenix run so should have a good bench mark to work from. Aircool_dot_com
did rec. the perrex ignition system for even beter results. Will instal
after KP. See you at Red Barn Fri. night. TACOS.
