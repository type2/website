&gt; &gt; If so, contact me.  I want to put a hitch on my 60 truck to pull light
&gt; &gt; loads.  MANY people have emailed offlist wanting to do the same, but no
&gt; &gt; solutions yet.  Looking for recommendations, parts source, etc.  Any advice
&gt; &gt; appreciated.

The y-shaped hitch for my early bay attaches to the torsion housing in
two places with U-bolts and extends under the engine to attach to the rear
bumper in
the middle.  It is made from rectangular stock (1/2 x 1 inch, IIRC) with a
standard plate welded on to accept a ball.  The torsion housing takes the
for-aft and sideways motion while the bumper takes the vertical loads.

It wouldn't be hard to fabricate a similar hitch.

I would use this hitch only for very low tongue loads (less than 100
pounds).
