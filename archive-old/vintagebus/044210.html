Howdy Y'all!
Sorry for this non-technical rambling post but I must share a little story about my 66 cammper and me.  I made a deal with a guy to sell my '66 bus about a month ago.  After making pre-liminary plans for him to come from Philly to get the bus, it develops a starter problem.  So I call the guy and tell him about the starter, also tell him I'll call him back when I get the chance to fix it.  After telling the potential buyer this, he finds another bus closer to his home.  AFter the deal is officially off, the bus starts fine, not giving me another problem.  Well, I'm in a bit of a pinch and really need the cash, so I list the bus again. I figured I'd take advantage of some poor sucker via that un-named auction site.  So it sells, at a fairly decent price.  Guy sends me the 10% deposit within 3 days.  In the meantime, I am beginning to develop a sense of dreaded seller's remorse.  The more I thought about selling this bus after having put so much time and energy into recueing and!
!
 ressurecting it, the worse I felt. Then yesterday, my 71 SuperBeetle sells to a guy from Canada (at a fairly decent price!, solving my financial problem and giving me the cash I need). To wrap this story up, the guy who bought the bus came to pick it up tonight.  He really liked it but he wanted a bus to do a complete resto (bone stock show-quality resto) and thought that there was more to do on my bus than he was able to handle himself.  So he asks me if I would be terribly disappointed if he decided to &quot;pass&quot; on the bus.  Of course I say &quot;Sure, No problem&quot;.  Anyway, I now have the cash I desperately needed from the sell of the bug, and my beloved 66 stays in the family.  This whole ordeal has just re-affirmed to me that this bus belongs with us and is a part who I\We are. The bus has spoken to me and told me that she does not want to be for sale anymore ever again! Well, The VW Gods have spoken, who am I to defy the cosmos?  What has your bus told you today?????????????????!
