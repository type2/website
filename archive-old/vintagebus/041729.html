Howls are caused by resonances inside the tubes, just as you can make a
nice tone by blowing over the top of a bottle.

You can also get a &quot;rushing&quot; sound from the air interacting with the
tubes.  I reduced this by attaching a 1/4 plywood &quot;floor&quot; to the rack.
This might even reduce the drag a bit over a bare rack because the
turbulance that causes the noise also causes drag.
