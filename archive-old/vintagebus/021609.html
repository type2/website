Hi Volks,
First thing after removing the engine check the endplay!  This could just be 
a little off and require new and/or bigger endplay shims to keep this in 
tolerance to prevent damage to the case.  Or the endplay could just be so bad 
that it is damaging the flywheel seal with all the movement back and forth.  
so not fixing the endplay will just result in a bad seal all over again!
