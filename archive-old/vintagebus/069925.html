Subject: Re: [VB] survey: testing cooling etc [VB] was side scoops

ok, cuz its late and i'm an *sshole, i have to say it:

all the talk about the airflow to cool the oil is kinda off the 
mark.... in my view, it is more important to have adequate flow to 
keep the HEADS cool! you want the MAXIMUM airflow through that fan 
and through the fins.

i know they are related, but mainly because high head temps are 
(mostly) what heats the oil... ergo, cool head, cooler oil. i bet you 
could run a vw motor for some time with OUT a cooler of ANY kind, but 
cut off airflow to the head and you are smokin' it in 5, 10 minutes.
a corollary would be that you could toss cold oil at the rocker box 
all day, but without airflow thru the fins, yer dead.

yes, cool oil is vital to the motor; yes, that oil helps cool the 
heads a bit; yes, hot thin oil is going to seize a bearing 
eventually.... but still, i worry about my head temps FAR more than 
the oil temp guage.

clara, add more data points to the experiment :)

flame suit on (but plenty of airflow to cool me down... or will that 
just fan the flames???)
