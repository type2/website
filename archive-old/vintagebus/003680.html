Subject: Seattle area shows -last weekend


&gt; List
&gt; This last weekend was such good time. We had three vw shows in the Seattle
&gt; area. I brought my digital camera to the second and third ones (northwest
&gt; vintage &amp; Seattle International Raceway meets) I have placed some of the
&gt; vintage pics on a web page and will up load the SIR pics soon (drag racing
&gt; 66 kombi).
&gt; Nothing of a web page but some great buses. Feel free to copy them for
your
&gt; own collections if so desired
