&gt; Question&gt;&gt;&gt;  Is the alternator THAT much better???  (i.e. should I go
&gt; back and grab the alternator and it's associated parts?)
Mark,
     Answer, YES. The generator is a sort of analog function, going up and
down in effectiveness as revs change and load varies.
Alternators are more yes/no affairs. they come full on at just off idle and
stay there pretty much regardless. This is better, Go get it.
