I have to admit, I too have had my fair share of parts poeple probs.
It seem like you dont want to go any where other than the places that youve 
gone to for years, or if your new to the town or the vw seen, find a good 
friend and ask where to go. (thats also a good way to find if they are a 
friend!!!)
I try to go in and out of the so called &quot;expert&quot; part stores. If your in 
there to long you ethier start to get mad or the sales man learns a lot.
