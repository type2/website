Subject: RE: [VB] 6V starter in 12V tranny...UPDATE

When I have high torque starters built we take a six volt starter and have
it machined to fit the 12 volt bendix and bushing, add a 12 volt solenoid
and off we go, I have had one of these in 3 different buses now and still
works after 4 years, so to answer your inquiry, yes you can have the shaft
machined for minimal cost to fit a 12 volt bushing, cheaper and easier then
changing flywheels.

Here is an update, pulled the motor and bushing...she
was really chewed up and not much left of her.  Also
has taken a bit off the inside of the bushing hole in
the tranny.  This was a new bushing and starter
greased well, but lasted only a matter of months. 
Another listee has emailed with the same problem
reoccuring.

I am thinking of having the 6volt starter tip machined
down to 12volt size and running it in the stock 12v
bushing.  I am not sure running the thin one again is
gonna be safe.  Especially that the case been eatin
into a bit.  Seems that thin bushing just might not be
enough with the hole messed up a tad now.  Has anyone
tried a different method other then the thin bushing. 
Liek my idea of mahining down the 6V starter tip?

Tds
