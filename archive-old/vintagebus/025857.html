Subject: Empi Tach Funkiness - help please
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com


Anybody out there have an Empi tach?  I have had one mounted in my crew cab 
for about 8 months that I finally got around to wiring up tonight.  According 
to the wiring diagram, one wire goes to the negative terminal on the coil and 
the other to a (positive) terminal on the fuse block.  

Well, the thing started working as soon as I had the coil wire hooked up - 
just the one wire.  Does this sound right?  With it hooked up this way it 
read that I was idling at about 1200 which seems correct judging by the sound 
(Yes, I know I need to adjust it down a bit)  It wouldn't let the needle go 
much over 3000 RPM even at 60 on the highway (I have small nut boxes) it said 
I was only turning _at_2800.  Seems to low on the high end.

When I hooked up the second wire it said I was idling around 1800 rpm.  It 
easily spun up to 5000 rpm...maybe a bit too easily.  Seems to high on the 
top end.  I didn't have much time to check this out before it got dark.  Will 
be driving it tomorrow on the highway so I will get some readings then.

Anyway, the first way seems to be reading too slow, the second too high.  I 
don't know the size of the ring and pinion so I cant really figure out what 
RPM's I am really turning by speed...and then do I really know that my 
speedometer is correct?

Anyone have any experience with old Empi Tachs?  Are they accurate?  Any 
suggestions? 

Thanks,
Dan
