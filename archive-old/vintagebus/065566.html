Subject: Re: Turn signal switch for my 67

&gt; If you only have one
&gt; switch, the PO probably just unhooked the dome light and connected the
&gt; dimmer relay wire to that switch.  If there are two switches, then one
&gt; has been added on.

That is what has been done then, I have an aluminum cylindrical push button
switch on the left side of my speedometer housing and that is the only thing
on the speedometer housing.  The hazards do not work and neither do the turn
signals (however if the lights are on and you push the turn signal it breaks
the contact on that sides rear lights).  Where would the 9-prong box be
mounted?  On the main dash I have (from right to left) I have a little metal
toggle switch, the wiper knob, speedometer housing, the headlight knob, then
the flasher knob.  I would guess that the little metal toggle is not original
and was the PO's answer for a dome light switch, although that does not work
either.  Also there is another little toggle under the dash that is not
attached to the dash board and doesn't seem to control anything either.  What
of this is original and what is not?  Do you or anyone else have a picture of
the original dash and turn signal switch that I could see online.  Once again
thank you for your assistance.
