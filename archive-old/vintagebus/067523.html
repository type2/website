Subject: Re: [VB] Mudflaps on Ebay

All I was saying by that statement (which I should have clarified), is that
take your choice.  No VW mudflaps, or the ones that RMMW is selling because
of a 'loophole'.  I'll take the RMMW ones over none.  Also them being made
out of old tires, well, at least they'll be good for about 40k miles if I
keep em rotated!

&gt;  They are not near as nice as
&gt; some of the older repop sets that I've gotten, but hey, when RMMW can't
sell
&gt; them unless they are NOS parts what do you want them to do???
&gt;
&gt; How about not sell them! Or at least not lie to thier customers about them
being NOS German. I won't be sending any cash their way because of that ,
for sure! Dishonest is dishonest no mattter what the circumstances.
