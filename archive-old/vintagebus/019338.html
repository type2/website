&gt; Yeah, you can buy those bits at a parts store.  Or use your old ones.  I

I might try that, if I could get the #$(% thing out of the dash!  The screws 
are out.  I'm pulling the thing but it won't budge.  The Bentley says just 
loosen the screws, and turn the speedo until the flanges clear them.  Well,
I tried turning the speedo: it moves about a half cm, not enough to clear the
screws (which are out), and I'm _trying_ to turn it.  It seems stuck.  Is there
a trick?  I don't want to bash on it for fear of breaking it.

While I was under there though, something clicked in my head, finally, that I'm
embarassed to admit kind of.  I'm sitting there disconnecting cables etc to
pull the thing out, and there's this plastic thing with wires coming out of it
where the speedo cable went.  I actually got out from under there, went to the
Kombi and checked it, the Kombi of course was lacking it...so I took it off.
And I looked at it.  And there was this click: the wiring I had cut in the
back, to the lights I thought the PO had installed on the rear bumper...was in
fact not a PO hack, but reverse lights installed (I guess) by the dealer.

Had I not worked on the speedometer I would have pulled the whole mess and
thrown it out.  Ugh.  Hate to think on that.  What I want to know is: when was
the change in '67 to reverse lights mounted in the body?  I have seen other
'67 Westies with them.  Just curious.  And I'm missing the lense on one, if
anyone has one they'd like to part with.
