Subject: Re: [VB] roofrack options


&gt; What are my options for a cheap roofrack? Any kind of mass 
&gt; production
&gt; luggage/ski/bike rack that fits a bus? If it cost less than $150 and 
&gt; only held
&gt; together only 6 months it would suit my purposes just fine, any 
&gt; suggestions?

Hi, 
  I saw the message below yesterday over on the type2 list. ( I lurk
there too : ) He doesn't mention split busses, but what fits a fat chick
should work maybe?......

Hey Everone,
I work at a roof rack store if you need racks I can hook you up at a good
price and free shipping even the bars.  I have put lots of racks on
vanagons bays and even a few Euro Vans, thule yakima or constuction
style.  If you have any questions give me a call or check the site.
Thanks
Kevin
