Hello,
I am French, I have a VW Bus Samba 1956

I have a question :  for the electric ventilator (in the roof) I have a
new switch (Number VW : 211 959 511 )
but I don't know the connection. Someone know the plan ?  : I have : 54
/ R / L / + / and one for the bulb.

Thank  you for your  assistance  -   Etienne
