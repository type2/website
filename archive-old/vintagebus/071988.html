&lt;&lt; Today I went back to check my work on the fuse box for the '61 Double 
 Cab. All the electronics worked. After I mashed on the horn button 
 with a little more muscle it was working too.
 ..............................
 at some point take it apart and sand the contacts.  Or at least you can pull 
the button, and sand the inside of the wheel where it grounds the metal.  can 
help make the horn work better.

grabbed some red spray paint to do my wheels. Unfortunately I 
 couldn't find any orange Rust-o-leum spray paint, but I did find some 
 yellow. So the flame job will have to wait until I find some orange. 
 Grabbed a little more flat black to paint the bumpers and touch up 
 the truck a little.  &gt;&gt;
.......................................
flat black isn't terribly visible.   You might think about brighter bumpers 
just to let the folks in back see you a bit better, avoid being rear ended.
