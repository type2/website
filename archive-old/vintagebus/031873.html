I wonder if this is the same bus that was at the VW show a few years back up
in Flagstaff?  Any ABC members have  photo's of this show? Actually I think
this bus was in an ABC news letter way back when. Looks like they made it
there in time for Bug-A-Rama. First place in custom bus, Watch out Kyle :~)

And the matching plywood and 2x4 trailer! I definitely
wouldnt wish to drive behind this rig without the
warning bumpersticker which reads: &quot;Honk if any
roofclips or ill conceived/executed jerry-rigged
trailers fall off&quot;. =)
At least they have chosen Phoenix's best neighborHOODs
in which to stay. &lt;high sarcasm&gt;

&gt; &gt; Spotted a whacked out baby blue hippie school bus
&gt; with
&gt; &gt; two splitty bus tops affixed on top. Roof clips
&gt; were
&gt; &gt; at the belt line up!
