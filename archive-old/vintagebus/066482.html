Subject: re:things to do

I agree with sentiment entirely...I think in reality these are projects that
will never be finished. yeah I candrive mine across country, but thiere is a
dent here, or the wipers don't work like I want, or the clutch pedal doesn't
move as well as it should, I want to listen to FM radio, or the gearing
doesn't work for the way I want to drive....etc.(just a few examples).

Then again if it were finished, how much fun would it be?

or as an old acquaintance of mine once said-why would you ever want to be
done, then what would you do?

was writ:
It's amazing how many parts there are to one of these buses, and they do
work
better if all the moving parts are clean of grit and greased or oiled as
appropriate.  I mean, I drive a 37YO bus around everyday, and I have this
list of things to do to it stuck to the overhead air vent.  I've had the 65
for years and would feel fine taking a long trip in it today, but there are
still a bunch of little things to catch up on.
    Then I realise there is something else to put on the list.
