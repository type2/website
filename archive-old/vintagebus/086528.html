&gt; You mean that cutoff valve that hooks into both lines from the pump?  I've
&gt; never seen one of those things ourside of pictures!  I don't think they
&gt; worked well to start with, since they disappeared so fast.

I've only seen one in the late Bug Bentley - it's not in the Bay Bentley.
Apparently, the '70 Bug engines had the totally-rebuildable fuel pump, and
it had a cutoff valve in the top.  '71, '72, and early '73 got the &quot;one
screw on top&quot; pump with the external cutoff valve.  In mid-'73 the pump
got leaned over to clear the alternator and the cutoff valve went back
inside the pump.

I suspect it might have been one of VW's &quot;existing stocks must be used
up&quot; change orders.  Once they started making the leaned-over pump for
the alternator, that pump could replace the earlier pumps and cutoff
valves, as long as you used the right (shorter) pushrod for it.  Only
one part to stock, easier to install, less potential leak points.

It seems odd that the Buses didn't get this valve when they used the
&quot;one screw on top&quot; pump in '71.  I wonder if the front fuel tank on Bugs
made the cutoff valve more needed there - if a Bug and a Bus are parked
on the same incline, nose up, the Bug's tank is higher above the carb
than a Bus tank is.
