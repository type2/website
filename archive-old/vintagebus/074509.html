Subject: pick up part in NJ to deliver it closer to Canada 

hello

Im looking if someone pass by atlantic city NJ or come by this area up north,
maybe vermont  show in Johnson ...  i have a big part to pick up there ..

Sure i pay for gas + ill add 24 pack canadian beer or nice wine bottle

anything closer is a good thing for me!  youll need a trailer or some room its
a shortened pan (80 inch x 4 foot approx)

id like to avoid to go there as i always mess up trrying to avoid NY city and
im afraid going there as i never been in NY ..brrr

otherwise ill bring an AIRS list  (ill drive along the I87 road in my 73
westy)

tthx for any help

email me any offer  at: mleard_at_csenergie.qc_dot_ca
(you could encounter some trouble replying in outlook express i dunno why)
