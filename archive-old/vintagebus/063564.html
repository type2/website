&gt;  The 3rd digit: 7 means it is a 67. Build date of Oct 66 means it is a 67.
&gt;Yours is an early one without dual mc and backups. Looking at all the 247
&gt;deluxes listed on Thoms registry, I only see one other 'early' one with code
&gt;430. 247078285 and it was built 2 months after yours: Dec 66.
&gt;What are the M codes on the plate behind the pass seat?
