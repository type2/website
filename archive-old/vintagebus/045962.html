Hello all,
  Well the hoops arrived yesterday (8 days since they were supposed to 
arrive), I went to pick them up and NOW I have to get proof that the SHIPPING 
WAS PAID FOR!
I need to get the # of the station they were sent from and a copy of the bill 
of lading. If nothing else I got to see the hoops for only a second....so 
close but yet so far. I'll try again tomorrow when they have a fresh crew and 
maybe we can find a way to get them into my possession. They were only open 
from 5 to 6, so theSat nite crew had to overwork.
                                                      Steve 57 singlecab
