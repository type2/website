Subject: Semaphores Request
Date: Mon, 13 Nov 2000 18:35:04 -0600
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

I have a request.  I've emailed a few other people, but no one seems as
friendly as the ones on the list.

I have been looking for a picture of the SWF sticker that is on original
semaphores. If someone out there could take me a good picture (or scan) of
what one looks like, and what it says exactly, I would greatly appreciate
it.  Also if you could put something in the picture to reference size (like
a ruler, quarter etc...), that would help a bunch.  I am in the process of
restoring some semaphores, and want to reproduce the SWF stickers that go on
them.

Thanks much
Charles
