 This will not work. The early and late pads are the same size. The
difference is the thickness of the pad material. You can put early pads in
late calipers but the life span is short. I was a little annoyed about the
last set of Beck-Arnley pads I got for my 77....they were mispackaged and
were early thin ones. All of them at the flaps were that way, the whole
inventory. If I had a wheel off, I could measure the opening of the caliper,
mine are late. If your opening was the same, then you would have late
calipers.....if they are around 1/4&quot; less then you would have early
calipers. Let me know and I can tomorrow....let me know if you want it in
millemeters.

&gt; Hi Bryan,
&gt; Remove one of the disc brake pads and take it down the your FLAPS and have
&gt; them match it to what they have in supply.  From what we understand 1973
and
&gt; later discs are a bit bigger than the 1971-72 disc brakes.   Eric&amp;Barb
