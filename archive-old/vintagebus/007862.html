Subject: 65 flasher relay

Hi volks,
Was just wondering what any one with a 65 that is still 6 volt does for turn
signal flasher relays.  I do have emergency flashers or did before the
flashers went out.  The relay for pre 65 w/o emergency flashers was $7 or so
from Wolfsburg West.  For 65 with emergency flashers is unavailable but the
listed price was  $130!!! Any reason why such a big jump.  Will anything else
work?
