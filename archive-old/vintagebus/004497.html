Hello All
I am in the process of &quot;trying&quot; to Revive a 66 deluxe bus ..I am now working
on the brakes and have a question...What is best thing to use to remove or
loosen up 35 years of build up of dirt and grease that has abundantly caked
on? There layers after layers on the front end parts surrounding the wheels
and also back wheels too.
any help would be appreciated.
