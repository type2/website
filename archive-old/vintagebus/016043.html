Subject: Hippy bus in mini movie

A friend called me up the other day and said he had some Medical students 
that needed to make a short little film for a class project. He asked if 
they could use the hippy van and I said sure. Well, the three came over this 
morning and we set things up. THey drove it down the street, came to the 
dead end and turned around. They then stopped to look at the map and bitch 
at each other for being lost. We then staged it so they were under the van 
with parts scattered around them and also tossing out a few things from 
underneith. THe things you find under an old hippy van !

I guess the whole med class will be together doing things like this at a 
large place here in town, so lots of doctors and doctors-to-be will see it.

I was wondering though if there would be any way to down load this to a 
site? I have seen homepages with little movies and such, but have not idea 
how they do it. Anyone have a clue ??
