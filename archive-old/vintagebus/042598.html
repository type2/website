&gt; I'm kind of surprised about all these people who say that Dr. Joe's towbar
&gt; is no good.  I towed my bus all the way from Falls City, NE to here (90
&gt; miles) at 60mph with no problems.  People's fears about the muffler clamps
*snip*
&gt; that have been mentioned.  Plus, anyone who travels freeway speeds with an
&gt; old bus in tow is just asking for trouble no matter how they tow it short of
&gt; using a trailer.

I would disagree that towing at freeway speeds is unsafe, given the proper
equipment and that your bearings in the bus in tow are all good.

I wouldnt use a dr. joe towbar on the highway.  I plan on either making my
own that attaches to the front beam but is wider and better braced, or
doing what others have done quite successfully...

Use flat plate steel to make things that bolt to the bumper bracket holes,
and weld a strong tube between them.  Then bolt a heavy duty bug towbar to
this crossbar.

I would *never* bolt a towbar to the splitty bumper brackets, i did that
once and was white knuckling the whole way home, they are just too thin to
hold a car in tow, dont do it.  I got away with it but i was really lucky.

take care,

Steve
