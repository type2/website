First off the Friday topic: I like to go to Berkeley and cruise the Type 2 
down Telegraph Ave and have all the hippie chicks flash the peace sign at me.

Second Safari windows: Everyone complains that safaris leak.  On most buses I 
have met the stock stationaries leak too!

And Last but not least: The Solvang meet is put on every two years by the 
Golden Gate Chapter of the VVWCA. (the same people who put on Kelley Park) 
The next show will be in 2000.  There is also a DH (dont call it a SOTO) 
Transporter day show but it usually has a low turnout.
