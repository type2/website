Hi all,

The 2003 Bad Camberg is DEFINITELY on again, June 20th thru 22nd, 2003!  The
German language web site for the best Vintage VW event in the world is up and
running now, with an English version to be up soon.  Go to:
http://www.Lottermann-veteranen-treffen_dot_de/   for more info.  Because of the
huge turnouts and the limitations of the soccer field they hold it on, they
might be limiting admittance of Type 2 Busses to Barndoor only, but don't
quote me on that...

Woooo Hoooo!  I've got my bags packed already!  See ya there!
