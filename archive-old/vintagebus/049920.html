[She's right, we need an Events Czar, any takers? --KH]

Hi there,

I tried logging on to the Events site but I guess it is under construction.
I would like to know of any VW shows happening in British Columbia or
Alberta in Canada this summer.  I plan on selling some vintage parts and a
VW truck there.  Any info would be much appreciated.  Thanks.

Tess Burke
