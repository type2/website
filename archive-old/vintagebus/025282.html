Hi all-

I was just wondering if there were any list members that are
going to the &quot;Reggae on the River&quot; concert this august.
This is supposed to the largest Reggae festival (and party!)
around (the world).  Its held in Redway, CA (3 hours north
of San Fran) and happens to be somewhat in my neighborhood
(for us, anything within 50 miles is in the
neighborhood).    Theres usually lots of later and early
busses at this show and other Reggae type concerts we
regularly attend in Northern Cal.  (yes, &quot;true&quot; hippies do
still drive them and no, this is not meant to continue the
discontinued thread).  Just wondering how many, if any,  of
them rastafarians were on the list.

Obligatory bus content- many thanks to those who provided me
info on shrinking my rear corner metal.  Probably saved me
&gt;from cutting up what would otherwise be a salvageable
corner.   Most of the info was emailed to me personally, so
if anyone else has similar questions, I will forward the
info.

Gerald
