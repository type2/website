Subject: Re: [VB] Was Checking Reduction Box Fluid

yup, you have a swingaxle and the rear wheel will tilt in when you jack the 
bus up.  This is normal, and expected.  When you let the bus down it'll still 
tilt, until it rolls and flattens out.

Check you gear oil with the wheels on the ground.   The RGBoxes and center 
section are all connected like a habitrail, ok, so it changed things when teh 
boxes are lower.  So check it on its feet, 

What is leaking?  engine oil or stinky gear oil?   get a light, and a rag, 
and take a look- often the middle can be the oil circle seals are bad, or the 
little 10mm nuts need to be snugged down (dont over tightened) or the 
mainseal is bad.  main seal has a drip from where the engine case meets the 
tranny.  

 Are yr tranny boots good? check for cracks or tears.

to check tranny oil just take the side 17mm allen plug off and the oil should 
be up to the bottom of the hole.   you don't have to check the RGBox level- 
they are connected you see.

If the main seal is leaking- the oil cooler seals probably are too- look at 
left side of motor for oil seeping out from under fan shroud.

&lt;&lt; HELP!
 A couple of you were nice enough (Cal and Steve) to lead me in the direction
 of checking my transmission fluid and reduction box fluid level.
 I noticed when the bus was on stands, the wheels tilted in.  I didn't think
 anything of it.
 I just opened the garage, and I have a very large puddle of oil, smack dab
 in the meddle, and both wheels are tilted in.  I ran here to the computer as
 fast as I could.  Well sorta.
 What's up with these wheels?
 I am going now to investigate the leak.
