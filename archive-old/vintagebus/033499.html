Subject: Re: [VB] Jerome Raffle Bus????? &amp; OT - Bug for sale

And while we're demanding things... Will the compulsory pictures be taken 
at the top of the grade so Ronnie can sell more clutch discs to the backed 
up buses ;-) and causing anger fits in beer and sleep-deprived bus pilots 
from the nether-regions?

OT - I just posted an e-bay ad for a 59,000 original mile '65 bug for a 
local VW club member. If you're in the market, see item #595300747, it's a 
sweet bug.

&gt;waiting and was curious if they were coming.
