I have done the disc conversion on my 67 Westy. I am very happy with it. The 
stopping power and confidence is tremendous. Empty or loaded.

Details: I found a 69 front beam which bolts in (68-69). This has ball joints 
instead of king pin front suspension parts. I purchased new ball joints, 
bearings, brake hoses, rotors and pads. Bought used spindles, backing plates, 
pressure reducer (for rear drums) and narrow 5 wheels. Bought rebuilt 
calipers. Prices on the new and rebuilt parts are easily available. Used 
weren't expensive.
I also needed a 3 LB pressure limiter valve to keep the pads against the 
rotors. Disc brake master cylinders have this incorporated in them. I found 
this at a &quot;racing-speed shop.&quot; It should be available without too much 
effort.  My 67 dual chamber master cylinder didn't have this. There is info 
in the archives about this as well as a VW rabbit master cylinder conversion 
that includes the pressure valve.
I got very helpful advice from Bus Boys on doing the conversion, and also 
bought the albatross beam conversion from them-the stock ball joint unit gave 
a much higher than stock front ride height. They recommended against using 
the vacuum booster. They said it wasn't necessary in their experience. THEY 
WERE RIGHT. The pedal pressure is just fine, and the firm pedal and ability 
to LOCK UP THE BRAKES is confidence inspiring. 

I didn't think the conversion was too expensive, and am VERY HAPPY WITH THE 
RESULTS.
The only down side is having two different lug bolt patterns, wide 5 on the 
back and narrow 5 on the front. I now carry a 12 V tire pump and a can of 
flat fix for the front wheels (not needed yet) and a spare wide 5 wheel and 
tire on the front (pre inflated air bag).  
The rear style hub caps fit on the front narrow 5 wheels without difficulty, 
and only the very knowledgeable notice the difference in wheels. 
Do it. It is worth it.
