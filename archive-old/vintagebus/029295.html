nick....

    for whatever reason... many people spell the &quot;cool&quot; in cool tins as kool
with a k....
    doing a search in the Archives at type2_dot_com for (and I quote...) &quot;kool
AND tin&quot; yielded the following results (at the link, that is...):
http://vw.i405_dot_com/S.asp?cs=kool+AND+tin&amp;cson=all&amp;rf=pre1
    i think you will find all the answers you need there... some people love
'em. some people hate 'em... i've looked at all the evidence, and i like 'em.
i also have the patience, experience, and tools to work with them to get them
to fit properly and stay there...
    type 3s.... i like the pancake design anyways... i like the idea of the
fan being on the crank... but i just haven't had much contact with them...

hope that helps....
