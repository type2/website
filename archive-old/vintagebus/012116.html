The insulation is a water trap.  Rust really hopes you will do this.

The way to stop the rust once the panel is clean and shiny is to 
spray it with a coat of POR15. This can be achieved by using
a skinny nozzle on the paint gun stuckup the drain do-hickey ( that's
the southern technical term) in the bottom of the rocker panel.

You can also get to this through the space under the rear seat,
but you may not get the bottom of the drain hole.

To get under the rocker panel under the doors, you will have to go 
up the drain do-hickey. This space is about 2 inches by 6 inches, 
three sided.
