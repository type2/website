Subject: Re: [VB] VW  Hippie Bashing

this list is disappointing-perhaps an IQ test is necessary. I just want 
to talk volkswagen.  Why are there so many time wasters here.
what the hell is a hippie-
somewhere in my life I learned that people are all individuals.....But 
they tend to belong to some group. They find comfort in being part of a 
group. Parents, conservative, hippy, gay, bikers, back pain sufferers 
etc. and of course we become more secure by saying bad things about 
those others. just like in high school!!!!!!!!
you know they had a honda to hit with a sledge hammer at the volkswagen 
show this week end.
I wonder if they squasshed a nice splittie at another car show?

My bus reminds me of my youth and simpler times.
