Subject: Rheostat for 6v wiper on 12v supply

Hello...

Follow-up to my post about electrical re-do on right-most fuse.

  1) Yep, I did find the light on the right side of the speedo.  Thanks for
all who let me know of there being two.
  2) In replacing the wiper switch (see below), I found that the Dome Light
is actually wired to the light switch + feed.  I guess the VW engineers
didn't want to bother running it further :)  I put that on another fuse on
my fuse panel.  Now 4 fuses do control all of what was tied to 1 fuse on the
right-most fuse.

My local &quot;non chain&quot; FLAPS carries Cole Hersee Co. electronic switches.  I
first ordered the 7496-11 Rheostat switch, about $13.  Installed it, found
that the mounting hole was too big but two washers did the trick.  Put one
behind the dash and one in front... not the most elegant, but it doesn't
look bad.

Now I can control the speed of my wipers.  Problem is that the Cole Hersee
7496-11 is 18 ohms, I didn't really know what I'd need so I ordered the 18
ohm model.  Too much.  After turning the knob 1/2 way it stops the wiper all
together. 

So last night I stopped by at the VW FLAPS and ordered the &quot;7496&quot; (without
the -11) and it is a similar switch with only 8 ohms resistance.  This means
it will more gradually back off the voltage (and speed).  The 18 ohm one
works fine, but I'd rather have more precise control.

Tonight I switched it out, and the 8 ohm rheostat works perfect.  At 8 ohms
the wipers are barely moving... and I can more precisely control.  The 8 ohm
part was also a $ cheaper.

Procedure recommended!
