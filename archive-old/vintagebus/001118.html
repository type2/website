Well, I just got my engine back from the shop.  It was cracked just below
the oil cooler on the exiting side.  They came up with an interesting fix
though.  They pressed two aluminum inserts into the block.  They were only
about three quarters of an inch tall But they did the trick.  No more oil
leak.  Just thought I'd post if this is something that some of you could use
the next time you encounter this problem....................
