 &lt;&lt; ...Do the math ....&gt;&gt;

Hello,

No, the math is correct from the information provided.  What the
folks who have purchased the 3.875 converted transaxles tell me
is that while they can go those speeds, they would prefer to cut
the rpms a bit.  With the conversion your Bus can go around 4-5
mph faster for the same given rpms.  They may not want to drive
faster but by cutting the rpms per mph and keeping engine/fan
speed up for correct cooling, they can eliminate a heck of a lot of
noise generation.  How much noise does your engine produce at
4583 rpm?   Some people like the sounds of pistons swapping
holes at that engine speed while others prefer to carry on a
conversation with the co-pilot without yelling.  There are other
reasons for this conversion but this is one of the main ones I'm
given.
