Subject: RE: [VB] Single/double cab bed patch pan
Date: Wed, 16 Feb 2000 08:52:36 -0800

if it was thick metal like original and in the correct pattern i'd be all
over it like flies on the proverbial.  yesterday the professional bus cutter
&lt;shudder&gt; and i went to look at the bed on that '60 single cab.  the bed is
great but the professional thinks the $400 american asking price for just
the bed is too high.  another listee told me about a single cab bed in a
wrecking yard sort of nearby and thought it'd be in the $100 range.  at this
point, having only looked at one of the trucks, the sole difference is that
the higher price includes the seller's labor in cutting the rear of the
truck from the cab.  going this route, there is still to come the separation
of the bed panel from the donor and the reattachment to the survivor.  how
many hours?  how much if paying someone else to do the work?  add this cost
in time and/or money to the original cost of the panel and &lt;quickly doing
librarian math&gt; i get a near wash with a savings in arduousness!

cheers,
