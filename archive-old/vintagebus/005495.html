Please, anyone that lives in, near, around, or would like to visit Louisiana
come to our club car show next month.
The Cruise/Car Show is October 14-15.
We have lots of great prizes to give away from many sponsors (bags, posters,
parts etc....)
There's gonna be good Cajun atmosphere, cooking, fun and games for the kids.
I really like Type II's, and there isn't a single driver (some projects
though) Type II in our club.
It would really warm my soul to see some type II's from the list show up.
The car show is open to all VW's so bring 'em if ya got em.
And while you're there, look me up and say HI. I'm really friendly, I swear
:)
Please visit our site for more information

Thanks

P.S. The show is to sponsor St. Jude's Children's hospital. If anything at
all, do it for the kids.
