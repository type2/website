i think i finally figured out why my bus is screaming so high on the 
freeway. (4500rpm _at_ 60) after reading some posts about redlining and stuff i 
went to type2_dot_com and looked through some of the tire stuff in the library. 
my '66 has a small nut tranny (i dont know why, there when i got it) paired 
with 195/75 14's. seems like you shouldnt even run 14 inchers with a small 
nut. and if you do, you'll need pretty tall tires. anyone else running 14 
inchers with a small nut? this is a fine time to discover this... im driving 
to Auburn Hills this weekend :-(  yup... im an idiot!
