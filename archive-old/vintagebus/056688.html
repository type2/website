Subject: Dust cover for nosecone Q's

Have been searching hi &amp; lo for the rubber boot that seals the trans nosecone 
to the hockey stick rod, believe part # 211 301 289A. Does anyone know of a 
place that carries this? Weve been told its NLA. A place in Cali (vendor) 
said everyone is using 211 711 183B (shift rod boot) and just zip tying to 
the nosecone..... that sounds like a crock to me tho.
TIA for any help/info
