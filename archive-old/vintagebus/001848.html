I've sprayed POR-15 with a gun...it cleans up easily with laquer thinner
(the economy pro stuff).  It did not need thinning to spray, but if you have
to thin it, Restomotive recommends &quot;their&quot; thinner....not sure why, but I
don't mess with chemicals enough to know what should work.  Yes you can sand
it, if you're a glutton for punishment!  It's better to spray on a mist coat
when the POR-15 is tacky.  This mist coat can be primer, or whatever you're
going to topcoat with (non-visible areas only, recommend), but hear this:
The mist coat should be very light, even, and dry.  I have noticed that when
I get it on too heavy, uneven, or wet, the POR-i5 cracks or bubbles.  Not
good.

&gt; So if I read this thread correctly: POR-15 is great stuff but don't spray
it
&gt; with a gun cuz you will never get it clean?  How do you do clean up this
&gt; stuff or thin it to spray?  You can sand it can't you?
