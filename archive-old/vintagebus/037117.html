Hey, was wondering if all the redux boxes were the same, and if not, how to
tell the exterior difference and if they're interchangeable.

50- 55 barndoor buses had wierd reduction gear boxes you'll probably never 
see 1.40 reduction gears

post barndoor 55-63 buses came with 36mm rear axle nuts 1.39 reduction gears

64-67 buses came with 46mm rear axle nuts and 1.26 reduction gears.

so basically you look at the rear axle nut.  Though special rgb gearing was 
available, it is extremely rare.

the RGboxes in post barndoors bolt up to the spring plates the same,  so you 
can interchange them.  As some one mentioned, it would be a very bad thing to 
have a mixed set on a bus, but often you will see a later on an earlier or an 
earlier on a later.

BD RGB do not properly bolt up to post BD buses, or vice versa, though I have 
seen a later tranny w/RGB in one, I dont remember exactly how it was done.
