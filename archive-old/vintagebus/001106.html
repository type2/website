Subject: 76 bay window for $90 with title
Date: Sun, 15 Apr 2001 18:28:34 -0500

I just bought a 76  bay window at a farm machinery auction for $90.  I went
there to buy a car trailer but I couldn't pass up the deal.  I don't know
much about that type of engine but it appears to be fuel injected.  The tag
on the door says 190 C.I.  I guess it must be about a 1700 or 1800 cc. it
has a little hair dryer like fan above the engine with black flex hose going
down to the tin.  I hope it wont be difficult to repair. Any hints:
suggestions?

Thanks,

Kevin Sullivan
