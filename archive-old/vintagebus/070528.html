Subject: Bus Depot &quot;Beep Beep&quot; is Back  (But Optional)

Perhaps the largest amount of email I got regarding the new site related
to the long-present &quot;Beep Beep&quot; when entering BusDepot_dot_com.  Strong
opinions in both directions. Some people asked for it back, saying it
had given the site personality.  But others complained that it
interfered with stealth bus parts shopping at the office or late night
at home.

It's back on www.busdepot_dot_com . But if you don't like it, bookmark
www.busdepot_dot_com/index2.jsp instead. Same catalog, no &quot;beep beep.&quot; Now
everyone's happy. :-)
