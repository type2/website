This is a long ramble on sc drop gates and tailboard rubber buffers,  stop 
here if it sounds boring to read above what buffers went where on what truck 
and why I think it might be like that.  This is non necessary verbiage, 
probably only of interest to vintage nazis who think about what rubber 
buffers are original to the trucks.  Just sorting through ideas, and am 
interested in what any one has to say about truck rubber buffers.

I looked at a bunch of pics since the original post, and came up with a few 
ideas:

seems the stamped bumper trucks came with bumpers on the body for the rear 
tailgate, like Wade described on his 57.  However, it seems that overrider 
trucks had bumpers on the tailgate that stop on the overriders. The 59 SC I 
had had the buffers on the tailgate, not in the body.   later (70 ed?) VW 
parts list show 2 choices for tailboard buffers.
261 829 577 (28x24)  and 
261 829 577 A  'for home market'

the A version is later than the plain version, and why did they change the 
size/shape?  cause of taillight change?  I dunno.

the parts number quoted in the 'gate stops section' from the 58 ed parts list 
also shows these two choices.  HM?   The only explanation I can think of for 
this is that the 58 ed he checked was updated for the 59 model year, which 
could have overiders (export) or none (home market).   I will want to cross 
references this in other edition s of the parts list.  (this is why I like to 
collect parts list of diff years)

Side gate buffers?  This 63 definitely has threaded holes in the belt line at 
the front end of the dropsides. Just like the threaded holes in the cargo 
doors for their rubber buffers.  AT the rear of the dropsides there is a hole 
in the beltline, you can see through it.  Straight below the rear hole in the 
dropsides, near the engine vents, just forward of the seam to the rear corner 
is a hole on the left side.  This matches up exactly with the rear hole in 
the drop side when the side is folded down.   This truck had had some repair 
done to a funky wheel well a couple years ago on the right side, and there is 
no hole, but when you reach past the battery to the mirror image of the left 
holes, it is evident that it was filled in, I am sure by the guy who did the 
work on the wheel wells.

so what goes in the side spots?   If there is a buffer on the body as well as 
on the gates, but only on the rear, one might think you would use a shorter 
stopper on the rear part of the gate.  Parts list  (70? ed) shows two choices:
261 829 575 rubber buffer 26x15 dropside -use 4
261 829 577 rubber buffer 28x24 dropside -use 4

SO the parts lists says use the same buffer for all 4 places on the gates, 
and ignores the spot for the rear buffer to bump against.  

In the pics I looked at, none of the stamped bumper trucks had the lower rear 
buffer, and a fair percentage of the later bumper trucks did.  Why is it not 
listed?  hm- check other lists..

the 58 parts list quoted on the website list only the 575 version.  It was 
changed at sometime after 58 is what that means to me.  The later PartsList 
described the buffers instead of listing a VIN change, for whatever purposes, 
in this case.

The 59 truck I had had funky old grey rubber buffers.  they were the more 
donut shaped ones, like the WW repros, rather than the WCM ones which look 
like cargo door buffers.

Any way, You can use whatever buffer are around, or either WCM or WW 
versions, but I do like to  try to figure out what was used when.

I called WW, to see what they said about buffers on trucks of years, to see 
what they thought of what rubber buffers were used where,specifically on this 
63 SC and talked to Oscar.  He did not seem to be sure of the buffer use, 
Told me I need '6 big bumpers' which omits the two mystery ones at the bottom 
rear sides (yeah get two small ones for those) and I got the impression that 
he just wanted to throw parts at my 'shopping basket' to slap it together. 
Grouchy.

So why does WW make them 10mm and 25 mm?   What exactly does the '26x15' and 
28x25' in the VW parts list mean?  width and height in mm I suppose, so the 
OG ones were 15mm high and 25mm high. plus the mystery size tailboard ones 
'for home market'

dunno that these idea fits nicely into the categories listed on Wade's drop 
gates  stop buffer page.

&gt;  &gt;Clara &amp; I are installing the gates on my 63 singlecab. We are not certain
&gt;  as
&gt;  &gt;to how the rubber bumpers are meant to go.
&gt;  I can't find good pictures in dropgates_dot_com.
