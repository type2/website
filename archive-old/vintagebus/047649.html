&gt;Hey, anybody know wher I can find the 55-63 front wheel cylinders (part
&gt;
&gt;#211 611 069/070) for less than the usual $30-$35? Are there any rebuild
&gt;
&gt;kits for these things? What is the part number if so, and where can I get
&gt;
&gt;these if I need them? Just a few questions I know somebody else is
&gt;
&gt;wondering about too.

I have ordered rebuild kits for my 58 deluxe from napa auto parts.  I think
Dave Easterwood said he got barndoor rebuild kits from them too.  Mine were
$11.00 a few years back.  I can not remember if it was for one cylinder or for
both in one wheel.  The guys at napa just looked up the part number and had
them the next day.  Come to think of it, another friend got some rebuild kits
for his 51 split window bug from them too, he was the one who told me to check
them out.
