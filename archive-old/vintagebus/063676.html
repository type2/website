Subject: Re: [VB] Big nut RGB bearings and gaskets

yes, but of course when the RGBox is apart and I need a gasket to put it back 
together I dont want to wait till some time after you get them in next week, 
and then shipping time.  The only LOCAL source who claimed access to them was 
also out of stock., it wasn't worth waiting.  Use those skills you learned in 
kindergarten- tracing shapes and using scissors.

&lt;&lt; I am currently out of gaskets (big nut) till next week. They are not hard 
to
 find both small nut and large nut 1 dollar a piece, you just didn't look in
 the right place. Or you can get away without useing them, I have used just
 Curil T sealant between the halves without a problem, the few thousands
 clearance without the gasket didn't seem to affect anything.

  Hi Thomas,
  If you just need gaskets you can make them out of simular thickness paper 
  with an Exacto knife.

 I'll second that.  the gaskets seemed to be hard to find, and five bucks a 
 piece if I wanted to wait for them to be ordered.   I traced the cover on a 
 paper grocery sack.  You can trace the inside with a little difficulty by 
 putting the pencil through the axle hole.  Punched the holes with a punch
 and 
 then cut along the lines with scissors.  Voila!   gasket!
