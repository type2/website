Subject: Off road barndoors, blow up dolls, and velvet elvis pizza (Tuscon trip report- long)
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

    I managed to make it to the tuscon AZ show this last weekend in my 57
single cab. Made it to the caravan point exactly 16 minutes after 7:00 am
and there was no sign of anyone. The 3 hour solo trip down to the show went
pretty smoothly besides the fuel filter needing to be changed more then once
and the wind blowin me all over the road due to my tilt canvas.
     I hadn't bothered to get directions since i was PLANNIN on goin with
the cruise, but since they left without me, we pressed on in hopes of
catching up with them which we never did. As we neared tuscon, we called
B.A.P. on the phone, figured we could get some directions to the local bus
show. Of course they hadnt even heard of any VW shows happening that
weekend, nor did they have a clue what or where American legion post was (i
dont even think the guy knew what a bus was). Ended up getting directions
from some locals at a circle K.
     made it to the camping spot and got setup. Greg noble managed to make
it over from CA drivin his ***** and got a ride down from phoenix with
Everett in his barndoor. The &quot;terrible 2's&quot; (local club) were there in full
force, and would prove to be quite entertaining. From what i heard, they
decided they needed a pirate flag so they left camp in search of one.
Somehow they actually found one and when they got back, 2 blow up dolls were
materialized from somewhere as well as 2 or 3 helium tanks and a few
packages of balloons. They decided they were going to launch the blow up
dolls holding the pirate flag via one big long arch of balloons into the
sky.... the dolls and balloons were filled with helium.....no go, too heavy.
the whole display ended up adorning a nearby single cab for the rest of the
night. I wont go into details about what people were doin while posin for
pics with the dolls, nor  will i say what the initiation was for a local who
wanted into the terrible 2's, but  i will say it was very....interesting.
About 30-40? buses showed up to the campout. Some real cool ones including a
61 westy. Dinner time neared and someone spoke of a &quot;local&quot; place named
&quot;velvet elvis pizza&quot;....  &quot;20 miles max&quot; was the info we were given and off
we went in the 61 rusty bus. My wife and I, Eric lucifer, greg noble,
Richard, and Robert filled the bus and headed out. Before we knew it, we
were cruisin down rocky dirt roads that hadnt seen any cars for a while. The
rusty bus never missed a beat. Eric lucifer wasnt too happy about not going
the proper way, but hell, it was me and wife who were sittin out in the
middle of the cargo area in lawn chairs gettin thrown about! =) 40 + miles
later we arrived at velvet elvis pizza, and right next door was a VERY clean
65 standard. It was being used as a billboard and hadnt been moved in a long
while. Owner was nowhere to be seen so we retreated to the velvet elvis.
Turns out it had nothing to do with THE elvis...but instead, Elvis costello
, or Elvis bradbury or some bullsh*t. What a scam lol. Back at the campout,
I managed to get everett and greg to do 7 shots this time. The plan is 10 at
jerome, so we'll see what happens. We quickly ran out of tequilla so we made
a roadtrip with sober rich drivin. The ragtop on the rusty bus was open and
Everett &quot;monkey bar&quot; barnes was hanging from hands and feet from the roof
rack inside  - haha..quite the show. Morning rolled around and we headed out
to get some breakfast at the local denny's. I mentioned that i had seen a
&quot;drive-thru zoo&quot; next to the highway
and I wanted to check it out, so the plan was made. We realized there was no
exit for it off the freeway, so we ended up on back dirt roads zig-zaggin
across the country side tryin to get to it. 20 minutes later we arrived to
closed gates - Keep out. We headed away  reluctantly , when everett and greg
took a sharp left  in his 55 barndoor and headed out across some farm land
on the side of the zoo to get a closer look. I flipped around in my 57
single cab and waited at the entrance of the road. Richard realized and came
back in the rustybus. Me and rich waited as everett and greg drove out and
around. I think greg wanted to bring a monkey home with him since all the
night before someone was walkin around with a stuffed monkey.....nevermind
all that. Anyway they ended up comin back down a different road only to find
they were blocked by a big ditch. Having driven all that way, they weren;t
about to turn back, so everett decided to drive his barndoor off the side of
the embankment!!  after he got up enuff ballz, he went for it and a few
moments later the barndoor was vertical! he gassed it and shot a 10 foot
dirt tail out...but he made it thru. Look for pictures coming soon on
thesamba, as we snapped lots of em. All in all a great time. Show gettin
bigger every year, hope to see you all next year!
