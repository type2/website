Subject: re:driving buses

Well sounds like a lot of folks use their buses for daily drivers-I think
I'll include myself in that group...although I do have a back up car-a '71
squareback.

I haven't done any serious road trips in either since last year-the problem
with a daily driver, is that it's hard to pull it from the road to give it a
decent overhaul, which I like to do-to feel confident enough about going on
a long road trip...
