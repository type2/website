There was a story in Excellence (Porsche mag) about 2 couples who
took Porsche 356 coupes to the Artic Circle and back.  For the trip
up the Demptster, they installed a second winshield made of plexiglass
over the original, with &quot;spacers&quot; so that it sat an inch or so off 
of the real one.  This would be a piece of cake to do for a bus, and
you could have several made up ahead of time.  When you broke one of
the plexi sheilds, you just grab another from your stash.
