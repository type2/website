Subject: Cost of Shipping Parts

Hello Volks.

I thought this bit of info would be of use to those who
don't know.

I have been selling many parts over that past weeks. I came
across a post office web page

http://postcalc_dot_usps_dot_gov/

in which you put in the origination and destination zip
codes and weight and out pops the cost to ship.

Thought those of you who are into shipping stuff (VW Stuff
of course) might find this handy.

Brent
