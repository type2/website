 &lt;&lt;Sure- the craziest and most unlikely things could happen, especially with a
bus, but Murphy's Law can probably be applied here- no matter how well you
prepare for something, it will end up being something else.... so- we've
established that our opinions differ. Big deal...&gt;&gt;
Hi Shawn,
We are often scoffed at that we are also too diligent at maintance.  Still we
have had things go wrong and due to this experience we have made that list of
parts mostly from those experiences and some from just in case scenarios.
Reality is a cruel task master and after having these experiences we would
rather carry parts that with we can get back on the road in less than 5 or 6
hours.  Instead of waiting up to a couple of days.  Opinions are wonderful
things but reality cares not for them.  It is great that you have had you bus
for years, but miles of experience count for far more.  Otherwise we know of a
1960 bus that has 20,000 original miles with the original bastard engine miles
would be considered the ultimate in durabilty by your years yardstick.  Rather
than a very nice original bus with a engine that was and is notorious for
breaking the crankshaft at about 30,000 miles.  Which is the reason VW stopped
producing these engines after about only 18 months and replaced them with
later 40 HP engines.  Making the bastard 40 HP engine one of the hardest to
find even in a core condition and retaught VW that the experience of testing
was invaluable, instead of the opinion of the poor engineer who designed it.
