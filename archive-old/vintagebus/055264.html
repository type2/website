Subject: Re: [VB] Questions from a Groovy Dude-belts

I writ:
&gt;In front I use a 4 point harness made by Tiger which I bought at Latest 
&gt;Rage. It is excellent and I strongly encourage this style of belts use 
&gt;over a hacked in 3 point. 
Matt writ:
&gt;I'm guessing that this harness uses the original lap belt locations for two
of the &quot;points&quot;. Where do the other two go? 

I have a non-walk-thru bus, so it may be different for a walk-thru.  I
drilled a hole in the back of the seat and bolted it in on the back side
(cargo side) of the metal.  I used a large 15mm bolt (same as the other seat
belt bolts) and large washers to tie in the shoulder belts.  With the Tiger
4 point the belts join in the back so only one hole was needed, instead of
two.  And I did use the stock belt mounting points for the two bottom belts.

Yes the 4 point is a little difficult to get in and out of sometimes, but
well worth the extra effort.

Muir was on the money with his quote Matt included.  Everyone drives like a
maniac because they are &quot;safe&quot; in the big SUVs and anything with airbags.
Sad.

Take Care,
