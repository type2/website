Subject: Bus for oil cooler mount!

I've got a proposition. I offered this baby about a month ago for $99.00 and
had a buyer but looks like he can't come to pick it up. I'll trade it for a
good, could be used, oil cooler mount (doghouse style) for my 1600 engine.
Here's the story: it's a 63 Standard - really a shell only with all the body
parts there. It has rust that was cut out. Front clip was replaced at one
time.  Wheels, suspension is on and a tranny with a hole in the bellhousing.
No title, no tags. It's got some dings and dents but from the way I see it,
very restorable. Want to just use it for parts - donor? fine with me. Come
and get it. I need room in my garage.
