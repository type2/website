In space you have extreme heat on one side of the ship and extreme cold
on the other. I believe they had a system to transfer the thermal energy
to even it out. I know that the Space Shuttle has a system for expelling
exessive heat out through the open cargo bay.

MBC. Omaha had its first snow overnite. Frodo will be going into the
garage until I see evidence of dryer weather. I have no heater system
whatsoever in my bus. Tough to clear the ice from a windshield without
it. Next year I will work on that but for now it will lay in cozy
comfort dry and protected.
