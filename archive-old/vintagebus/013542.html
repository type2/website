Allright - here it is.  My transmission does not come out of third gear.  When
I have it in neutral, it is in third gear.  When I put it into any other gear,
the transmission locks up because it is in two gears at the same time.  I've
worked on other trannies, but never a vw.

What is involved in fixing this?  Anyone have any similar experience? Is the
problem just in the nosecone with the hockeystick?  I've worked on other
trannies, but never a vw.  I just want to know what to expect.

Also, there was someone very recently who posted pages for servicing a
transmission.  I can't find it (too fast on the delete button), so I'd like it
very much if someone could direct me to that page.  (maybe the tranny person
himself!)

Help!!!!!!

Thanks

Paul
