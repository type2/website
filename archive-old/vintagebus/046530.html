Subject: Tires; What I found
Date: Thu, 5 Nov 1998 08:09:33 -0800

Hi all,

	With all the talk about tires lately and the fact that I've been
looking at replacing my mis-matched (bastard) set and came across what
appears to be a good deal on the perfect tires for my bus.

	My '66 E-Z has 14&quot; rims so I don't have such a hard time finding a
variety of tire sizes.  Anyway, what I found was that Costco stocks
&quot;Kirkland Signature&quot; (manufactured by B.F. Goodrich) LT195/75R14 A/S
B/W;  w/ 60,000 mi. warr.; All Season deep HWY (NOT OFF-ROAD) Tread;
Load Range &quot;C&quot;  (max Load - single - 1435 lbs _at_ 50 psi / dual - 1325 lbs
_at_ 50 psi); 4(?) ply (tread - 2 poly/2 steel, side wall - 2 poly).  The
best part is that they cost $48.49+ $7.00 mnt/bal/rd haz OR $55.49 each
out the door!!!  Not a bad set of tires for $220 and change!!  I think
that's well worth the $35.00 a year membership alone!!  When I return
from my trip, I'll be getting a set.  Ooooh they're gonna look sooooo
good and handle even better!!!  The only draw back is they are blackwall
ONLY. . . but I can live with that ;-)

	I'm NOT trying to start an e-mail riot by keeping this thread alive, I
just hope some of the 14&quot; wheel'd folks can use the info.  Sorry, I
didn't even look into 15&quot; tires, but who needs those anyway?? ;-)  

	Standard Disclaimer:  I am in NO way connected with Costco Inc. yada,
yada, yada. . .
