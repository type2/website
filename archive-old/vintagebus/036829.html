Subject: 66 titled 67 bus for sale in eugene oregon
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

I was driving in the country the other day and found a 67 bus that has been 
sitting a few years. it has floor and rocker rust but is fairly straight. it 
no longer has 67 numbers, once upon a time the lady had a 66 and 67, lost the 
title for the 67 and put the 66 numbers on it. It only has the numbers on the 
fresh air box, she didn't bother to get the m code plate. she also lost the 
title for the 66 numbers but is in the process of getting it. said to have a 
rebuilt tranny 20k ago, running when parked five or six years ago due to 
generator failure. 1600 dp motor. comes with parts to redo the brakes. she's 
wishy washy on a price but I think 3 or 4 hundred would buy it. 
pmail me if interested, I'll give you her number.
