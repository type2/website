All right Clara!  You are making me do it!   Instead of futzing with the
34PICT-3 I am switching to the 30PICT-3 I have on the shelf.  Of course with
the reducer adapter plate.

I figure from what you are saying that one of the passages in my rebuilt
34PICT-3 is still clogged.  More days in the chemical bath and some stale
air blown through it.  

Right now I just want the bus to go!  It is seriously getting on my nerves
the last few days....  How come every little thing takes about three times
as long as you originally think it would have?

I think I have the most expensive cruddy looking and NOT working bus in
Georgia!  Begin the profanity here $%^_at_#%(!*&amp;

Thanks for letting me rant ;)
