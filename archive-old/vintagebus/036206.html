I'm looking for suggestions/help in finding a AM/FM stereo radio for
my 67 12 volt all original bus with the small  radio cut out. Any help
or suggestions with a system that can be installed without cutting the
dash would be greatly appreciated.

hm- seems to me the 67s have a bigger hole than the 66 and earliers.  They
came with a plate unde rthe dah, and took the same style radio.  I dont know
much about radios, but I do find ones to fit a vw w/o cutting holes- the
am/fm/tape player kind.   I put one under the dash tray in my 65 camper, and
put a  stock block out plate ove rthe radio hole
