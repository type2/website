Subject: insulation for cover plate

Hi,

We're newbies and just bought a 1982 Westie, air cooled. We live in Port 
Townsend Wa. The rear cover plate over the engine is lacking insulation 
in one of the recessed panels. Does anyone know where to obtain 
replacement insulation, or whether its even necessary.

thanks,

alan dolit
