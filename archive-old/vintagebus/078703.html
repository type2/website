Subject: These VW motors are amazing

Got my '53 Kombi in the winter, so really haven't tinkered with it until
spring has showed up. According to the tags the bus/motor was last running on
the road since '77.

So changed the oil, plugs,points and got rid of the stale gas. Rebuilt the
carb and lubed up the choke linkage. Then turned the motor over by hand and
without the coil connected to get the piston compression and oil circulation
going.

Moment of truth... put the ignition key in and hit the starter button. The
motor kicked in after 5-8 revolutions and away she went. It really has a very
sweet stock sound still after all these years...

Amazing!

Scott
