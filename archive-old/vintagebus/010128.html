Hello all - this is actually No Quarter.  I decided to drive the 100 miles
up to Rob's this evening to attend the club meeting.  About 3 miles from the
pizza joint, I lost a cylinder which was later diagnosed as a broken rocker
clip which made me loose the #4 rocker.  Tomorrow I'm going to order some
bugpack rockers from the guy who helped me out (Phil Cram) by giving me a
couple of washers and spring clips.

Anyway, Rob's SC is running a freeway flyer with a 1600DP and it beats the
pants off of my bus in take off and crusing speeds.  Now don't me wrong, I'm
not envying the fact that he can blow me away but it does tell me something
that even with my 1776, I'm not able to get up and go as fast and that is a
direct result of one change in the equation - the fact that I'm running the
15 inch rims and tall tires.  Running the 15&quot; tires on a STOCK transmission
with an engine that is bigger than the original stock bus ones is okay if
you wish to increase your top end slightly.  But to run tall tires with a
freeway flyer is really not a good thing.  I was able to cruise 70 to 75 on
the way to the meeting tonight but the bus was a bitch to handle and I
really didn't enjoy those speeds as much as I thought I would.  It takes so
long to get up to speed that I fear for the life of my engine due to
lugging.

The tires I have are a light SUV rated Toyo Tranpath 185's (nice vintage
narrow look) tire on 15 inch (that is pre 64 bus) rims.  2 spring clips are
broken (one on each of 2 rims) but all 5 rims are powdercoated in gloss
white.  4 tires have 3,000 miles on them and the spare has none.  I'm a firm
believer in doing 5 rims at once so that when you put on the spare, it
doesn't look like a spare.

So what I really would like to do is trade my set of 5 rims and tires
straight across for a set of 5 - white powdercoated 14&quot; rims with good used
tires.  I think this would be a good deal for someone who wants those hard
to find 15&quot; rims on their bus.

I really don't want to go to the trouble of sandblasting and powdercoating
another set of bus rims but I would be willing to talk cash if necessary to
further my intent of getting 14&quot; tires on my bus.  I considered looking at a
lower profile 15&quot; tire but the ride will suffer and where do you find a
reinforced sidewall tire with a low profile? HA!

Please email me at silent_at_beatricene_dot_com if you would like to arrange a
trade or talk cash.  I'm located in Beatrice, NE.
