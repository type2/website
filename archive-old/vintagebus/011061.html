yes, the conversion is quite undoable, I converted that 59 truck I had back 
to 6V . Partly because I got a 40hp motor with the 6V stuff out of a bug 
someone wanted to change to 12V and have a bigger motor, so I got a turnkey 
motor and gave him all the 12V stuff out of the truck with a dead motor. 
Seemed easier. But if it ain't broke don't fix it I say.  Sometimes I thin k 
Of converting my 65 westy back to 6V though.

 &gt; I know it is being sensitive but please don't lecture keep it stock and
 &gt; then say to hook up two batteries. This is written mostly tongue in cheek.
 &gt; And in no way did the above statements piss me off. I couldn't run my
 &gt; Alpine CD player with two amps and 6 speakers without my 12 volts. So 
there.
