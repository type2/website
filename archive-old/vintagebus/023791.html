&gt; I Have A speedo/ fuel gauge in my Binz that PO installed. It is out of
&gt; a 71 bug, and the combo works great. The fuel tank is out of a 65 bus
&gt; and the calibration between gauge/tank is right on. This is the way to
&gt; go if you have an early bus and don't want to bore a 2&quot; hole in your
&gt; dash for the gas gauge. The PO saved the original speedo so it can be
&gt; reinstalled if need be. All indicator/warning lights work OK also.

This is a nice guage also for a later bus, if you want to run a temp
guage or oil pressure. Just put the new VDO where your fuel was, and no
dash cutting either. 68 and later bugs come with this style, I believe.
