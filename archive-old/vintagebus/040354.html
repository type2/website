Is there anyone over in England that gets Total VW and could send me a couple copies of this months issue?  I'll gladly cover costs plus some beer money.  My friend in London told me my bus appeared in Total VW this month but she can't seem to find a copy for me.  

Thanks,
Richard


FLAT 4 is now called Total VW. This magazine is getting better and better...

But VolksWorld RULES!!!
