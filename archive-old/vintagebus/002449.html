So I found a clip (I think that's what it's called) - one of those round
clips that require a special type of pliers to remove. Outside diameter is
maybe 1 1/8 &quot;.  It looks like a washer with a little piece missing and two
little holes that the special pliers go into (I know this sounds stupid and
that I'm probably the only person on the list who doesn't know what this
thing is called.)  Anyway, I found it where I was recently working on
replaceing my clutch cable (I couldn't do it as simply as Muir says and had
to remove the whole clevis type deal) and removing my front shift rod lever
and shift rod etc..  Could this clip be from one of those things?
