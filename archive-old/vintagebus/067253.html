Subject: Friday~ bought another water pumper!

With a little help from a friend I scored a low dough 45mpg '80 Dasher Diesel
Coupe. A definite pt A to pt B commutermobile if I ever did see one. Bring all
of the Dasher parts and useless manuals that you need to get rid of to Havasu.
They will be accepted like unwanted babies at a firehouse. No questions asked.

Black on black with black interior (with no A/C) will be just the ticket in the
8 month long Phoenix summers. Maybe I can turn it into a rolling tribute to
folks who have no sense. Perhaps it's target for an artcar? Seller swore that
it had an excellent heater in it. I will take that under advisement. Maybe I
can drive it until it turns into a molten puddle of pooh. I can laugh at myself
until the price of gas goes through the roof. At that time I will laugh like an
Audi Fox.
