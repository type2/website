Subject: Re: [T2] RE: [VB] Camper and Commercial Magazine

I am looking for the spring 2001 issue that has the first part of a
waterboxer rebuild article in it.  If anyone has this issue and can part
with it, let me know.

&gt;
&gt;     GOOD NEWS, for those of you that don't subscribe to Camper and
&gt; Commercial magazine from England, I will be a dealer for it over here. At
&gt; this time I have an order in for 10 copies and can up it with-in the next
&gt; week
&gt; if there is a lot of interest.
&gt;    The next issue will be out in March and I should have them even before
&gt; subscribers. I do not have an exact total of the cost but they will be
3.50
&gt; pounds (whatever that is in dollars) and post. I will divide the post up
&gt; between the number of copies and add that to the magazine cost.
&gt;     I have also talked to them about carrying Total VW, if there is
&gt; enough interest I will bring those in also
&gt;
&gt;   The March issue has an article on Dan Kinsey's Binz that was redone by
&gt; Kustom Koach Werks in Grand Junction Colorado.
