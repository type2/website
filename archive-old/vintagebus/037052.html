&lt;&lt; Hi list,
  Can anyone tell me if upper and lower front wheel cylinders on my 65'
 are the same? When I received my Bus Depot order, I noticed all the
 boxes say upper. When ordering, I didn't see anywhere to specify. Is
 there a difference???
  &gt;&gt;
yes, the difference is that the upper cylinder does not have a bleeder valve. 
 This is the only difference.  they are interchangable, but the lower one 
come with a bleeder valve.  SO either you buy a new bleeder valves separtely, 
or in the tradition of cheap VW people, you reuse the crusty old one.
