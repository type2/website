i believ that those are what are known as interior door panels, the previous
owner of my bus installed some. He got them from wolfsberg
west[www.wolfsbergwest_dot_com]. They did not come with holes in them to connect
to the door. You need to cut these holes yourself. A while ago there were some
posts on different ways of doing this...i don't remember exactly.

good luck

In my frontdoors are some interior, in a kind of wood with grey surface.
In back there are som green plastic plates, those would I like to change to
the grey &quot;wood&quot;.
Where can I buy this grey &quot;wood&quot; ?
