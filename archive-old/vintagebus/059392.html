&gt; Another frustrating weekend. Spark when turned by hand, no spark when turn=
ed
&gt; by switch. So I figure it needs new + and - cables(the old ones were REALL=
Y
&gt; bad). The starter didn't bog down as quickly but it still won't fire, even
&gt; when gas or ether is added to carb. So it's an ignition problem. Maybe.
&gt;=20
&gt; Too many variables, maybe. I'm quite sure the dizzy drive is in wrong but=20
&gt; in
&gt; my ignorance, I thought it could only go in 2 ways: Correct and 180=BA off=
.
&gt; But since it has a gear on the end, I believe there are, like, 8 ways to
&gt; screw it up.  SO I put the motor at TDC (#1 piston was all the way up,
&gt; right?), the slot on the disty drive was not pointing straight up as shown
&gt; in the idiot book, it looks to be advanced one cylinder. So I moved all th=
e
&gt; wires clockwise one setting. RRR-RRR-RRR-RRR-RRR -- nada.
&gt;=20
&gt; One other possibility: The webbed ground strap on the tranny? It's all=20
&gt; kinds
&gt; of gunked up. Could that be the problem?
&gt;=20
&gt; Can you advise me on any of this mess?

Hi Bill,
First the position of the distributor drive is not a problem as long as it=20
allows the distributor to align up as to allow proper timing!  Next remove=20
and clean your tranny grounding strap.  Followed by buying a voltage/ohm=20
meter from your local hardware store for about $15-20.00.  Make sure to buy=20
one that shows well the 0-15 range and we prefer the non-digital LCD type, i=
n=20
other words the ones with the old fashion needle to watch swing back a forth=
.=20
 Then check your voltage at the battery directly and check for voltage drop=20
at each and every connection going from the battery to the starter to the=20
fuse box to the headlight switch to the ignition switch and back the the=20
starter solinoid.  Clean all connections and add a dab of vasalene, or=20
dielectric grease to help prevent future corrosion.  Any componants that do=20
not clean up either need to be replaced or repaired by soldering internal=20
compontents together!

&gt; &gt;&gt; It's a late '66, factory 12V with an aftermarket alternator/ regulator.=
=20
&gt; It
&gt; &gt;&gt; was running in the early fall, but hasn't run after putting my dash bac=
k
&gt; &gt;&gt; together after painting it. For a while, I wasn't getting juice to the
&gt; &gt;&gt; coil,
&gt; &gt;&gt; so I ran a new wire from the top of #2 fuse and the coil. Points, coil=20
&gt; and
&gt; &gt;&gt; regulator are now getting juice with switch in on position. Starter is
&gt; &gt;&gt; turning. I tried to get a spark by turning the engine by hand and=20
&gt; holding
&gt; &gt;&gt; the spark plug wire 1/2 inch from some bare metal. No spark, but the fa=
n
&gt; &gt;&gt; belt that came with my alternator kit is sort of loose, even with no=20
&gt; shims
&gt; &gt;&gt; between the pulley (do you know the right part # for a smaller alt=20
&gt; belt?)
&gt; &gt;&gt; so it's tough to get her to spin. The distributor rotor turns okay,=20
&gt; though.
&gt; &gt;&gt; I even tried ether but it didn't fire. Out of about 10 attempts I THINK=
=20
&gt; I
&gt; &gt;&gt; got
&gt; &gt;&gt; a brief sputter for about a second.
&gt; &gt;=20
&gt; &gt; You can check for spark without all the turning of the engine.  Though i=
f=20
&gt; you
&gt; &gt; have a helper just turn it over for you is the easiest way to do it.  Yo=
u=20
&gt; can
&gt; &gt; also turn the engine till it is at TDC #1 cylinder and check to make sur=
e=20
&gt; the
&gt; &gt; points are closed.  Remove the #1 sparkplug and make sure it is against
&gt; &gt; something to ground it.  Turn on the ignition switch to power and remove=
=20
&gt; the
&gt; &gt; wire from the distributor that goes to the condensor on the distributor=20
&gt; and
&gt; &gt; you should get a spark at the plug!
&gt; &gt; If you have spark then you need to figure out if you have fuel.  Often i=
t
&gt; &gt; is a good idea to pour about a tablespoon down the carb to get the engin=
e
&gt; &gt; going.
&gt; &gt; As for your fan belt problem we have no idea which lower, let alone whic=
h
&gt; &gt; upper pulley or even if they are stock that you are using.  Hopefully at
&gt; &gt; least you are using the 2:1 lower pulley which almost always has a &quot;D&quot;=20
&gt; about
&gt; &gt; 3/8&quot; tall stamped on one of the pie shaped coragations of the pulley.
&gt; &gt;=20
&gt; &gt;&gt; One clue: Starting drains the battery quickly and the - terminal clamp=20
&gt; was
&gt; &gt;&gt; so hot it gave me a blister. Zoinks! The ground strap appears okay.
&gt; &gt;=20
&gt; &gt; Do you have one of those darned repair clamped on to the cable battery
&gt; &gt; terminal?  If so either get a new battery cable with clamp on it or=20
&gt; solder a
&gt; &gt; brass clamp onto your old cable.  Otherwise take the repair clamp off th=
e
&gt; &gt; cable and brush clean the clamp and cable areas where they connect and=20
&gt; repeat
&gt; &gt; this cleaning two or three times a year.  Also for any battery clamp it
&gt; &gt; really helps to cut down on corrosion by soaking these battery clamps in=
=20
&gt; a
&gt; &gt; baking soda water solution to nuetralize all acid that has soaked into=20
&gt; them.
&gt; &gt;=20
&gt; &gt;=20
&gt; &gt;&gt; I'm ready to to tow the thing in to someone who knows what they're=20
&gt; doing.
&gt; &gt;&gt; I'm also considering trying to rig a switch in the back so I can test=20
&gt; spark
&gt; &gt;&gt; and so on whilst working alone.
&gt; &gt;&gt;=20
&gt; &gt;&gt; Any suggestions?    Bill     66 Standard
&gt; &gt;=20
&gt; &gt; Best you try to do as much as you can.  It will save you $$ in the long=20
&gt; run
&gt; &gt; and better yet give you experience so you can do repairs yourself in the
&gt; &gt; future!  So break out the Idiots manual by John Muir which is quite=20
&gt; hepfull
&gt; &gt; for the begginer VW owner, &amp; have the bus shop manual from Bentley for=20
&gt; all
&gt; &gt; the tech info you will need.  above all keep asking questions!
