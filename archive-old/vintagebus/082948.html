Subject: Opinions on backfire

Finally had a day to work on the Bus (been since Sept).  It started fine and
the backfiring (popping) seems to have went away, had added some berrymans
cleaner in the tank.

However, when I turned it off, twice, it backfired or popped fairly loud.
Thinking it's valves, timing or cylinder loaded with fuel still.  Seem to be
on the right track?

T4 with Dells.
