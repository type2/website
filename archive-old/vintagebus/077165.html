Subject: CHEAP sale/trade Westy/Riviera - must go....

I'm sending this to the vintagebus list in case anyone is looking for 
a good engine, spare wheels, interior, or a Riviera top for your      
splittie...                                                           
                                                                      
Howdy all - hope Santa was good to everyone. After a long story       
involving helping a friend with money problems, I now have a '69      
camper that I need to get rid of as soon as possible. Bus is in       
Raleigh, NC, and is drivable. It was originally a Westfalia, and      
someone at some point replaced the westy top with a nice Riviera top  
(no canvas). It has about 1/2 Westy cabinets, and 1/2 Riviera         
cabinets. Nice doors, glass, etc. Rebuilt engine, &lt;8k miles (1600 SP, 
with Alternator). Runs                                                
great, new battery. Brakes need bleeding, but work. Bad part of this  
bus is RUST. front floors alreaday patched, rockers rusty...You won't 
fall through or anything, but it would take a lot to make this a show 
bus. On the other hand, a bit of patching, and you'd have a great bus 
that you could use and enjoy, and not worry about scratching driving  
in the woods.                                                         
  I need to get about $850, although that's negotiable. I'm already   
losing money on the debt anyway, so I'm just trying to salvage        
something. Also will consider trades or partial trades for old        
scooters (Vespa, Lambretta, etc), welding equipment, a good heavy duty
winch, late 60's Mopar 340 or 360, any interesting offers             
considered...drop me a line if interested, I need the driveway space, 
and ready to close this chapter...Come by and drive it home...
