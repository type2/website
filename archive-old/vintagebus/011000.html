Subject: [VB] Barndoor options
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

Does anyone have a list of what options were available for barndoor busses.  
I've been told that M-codes didn't exist at that time, but I know that 
options must have been available.  My '52 Standard has a drivers side sun 
visor which I haven't seen on many standard barndoors as well as rear corner 
body bumpers.
