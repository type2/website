The 195 SR 15s were available in Oly at the tire place by big 5 on Cooper Pt 
Rd near the mall last summer, but they were about $150 each ( LT).  if you 
find them $300 for 4 let me know.   Hm- is that with shipping extra?

&lt;&lt;   We have been plotting of trying a taller Cooper 195/82R15 tire for our 
 pre-1964 buses due to the lower and tighter inner folded lip in the rear 
 wheel wells.  These were suggest by a fellow vintagebusser who's name eludes 
 us!  He said these were for Range Rover and availible for $300.00 for four.
