Just got back from Pomona--Hunting was pretty good--found 2 more pieces
for Bessie--
also a very nice 1959 VW Bus factory shop manual--Seems as Pomona is
slowing done Seller wise and Buyer wise?  could E-Bay be taking a
toll?--Blauplunk  i know i spelled it wrong--AM/FM 6 or 12 volt radio
that worked--$35!!! now that's a deal!!
Someone left a set of 4 of 14&quot; bus rims--but i found a taker--price was
FREE!!!
also a 15&quot; bus rim with a good tire!!--At least Magoo and i got thru
this Pomona without anything being stolen!!--Saw the &quot;50 Year Bus
Book&quot;--and one of the authors--Keith Seume--Drakula &amp; Bessie made the
book--also 15 pictures that i donated to Keith made the book--Amazon_dot_com
has the book for $20!!! plus postage--If you like real Buses
that are drivers--this is a great book--Micheal Steinke and Keith have
done a VANtastic job--With so many American buses in the book--It would
be fun to order one and keep it with you and get the owners to autograph
the pictures!! Welcome back Blue Nelson--he really had some treasures
out there!!  lots of rare stuff--Saturday night was of course BUS
