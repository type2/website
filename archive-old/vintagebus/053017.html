&lt;&lt;  When did VW stop making small nut transaxles?&gt;&gt;

Hi Jdd,
Early in 1964 model year. 

&lt;&gt;

They were the same.  Due to DPOs of the tranny any gearing could be in there. 
 When we got our 1960 panel camper it came with a small nut tranny that RPMed 
out at 3,000 RPM _at_ 35 MPH in fourth gear.  No wonder the DP engine that came 
with the bus in the cargo compartment had a hole through the top of the 
engine case from a thrown rod at probably 5,500 RPM at 55 MPH!    Eric&amp;Barb
