Subject: My NW VW weekend (Very long!)

Well,  just got in from the flight down from the great NW.  I managed to
turn an obligitory trip to visit relatives into a really cool weekend
looking at and buying stuff for my and a friends VW.  

The family and I arrived  and spent the night at the relatives house . 
The following morning my brother in law and I headed out to follow up on
an ad he had called on regarding a 67 bus for $1200.  About an hour
later we rolled up to the address and discovered an old gas station
littered with busses and bugs of all types.  Upon talking with the
mechanic working on a splittie on a lift we discovered that the bus in
the ad was the one he was working on.  They had already sold it and were
putting a few finishing touches on it.

We then met the owner...real nice guy.  I had brought a list of parts I
would be needing and we proceeded to look around the yard for any
suitable parts to buy.  Unfortunately,  he did'nt have anything that I
wanted.  They we're parting out a hardtop 67 deluxe.  I needed the
rocker trim for a fellow list member, but it was gone already....same
with the clock he had asked for.  We walked a little more, and the
mechanic that was showing us arround, asked me if I'd like to see his
original hardtop deluxe.  We walked around the corner and there sat his
very original walkthrough deluxe hardtop.  It had all the trim, middle
seat and bars and almost no rust.  Very nice.

He pointed out that about the only thing missing was a block off
plate.    I told him I was going on up to the NW vintage meet, and that
if he wanted me to, I'd look for a plate for him.  He thanked me and
then said &quot;do you like ovals?&quot;.  I said YEA.  He said, &quot;well, you've got
to see this&quot;.   

We went inside the shop and around the corner past a customers 50's 356
and there sat one of the strightest ovals I've ever come across.  1956
euro deluxe sunroof.  This was an export to Norway that originally came
with the 50 horse Okrasa motor.  It was not in the car though :-(  The
car had more accessories than I have ever seen on a original car. 
Original roof rack, horn ring, kilometer speedo (showing 14000),
ignition lock combo starter button, accessory gass pedal, cigirette
lighter, becker am/fm radio, parcel tray, reserve lever extension, dual
ski racks (with skis), fluted lenses etc. etc.  No rust, no dents, never
hit, new 36er w/ 200miles.  Was resprayed badly once, but this was one
fine little car.  $8500.   Well, needless to say, I never intended to
buy a oval when I was on this trip, but this car got my blood going.  I
walked out of there thinking this could be a good buy.  I thought about
it long and hard all that night.

The next morning at  I set out to drive to Seattle and the NW vintage
show.  I made it there about 7:30 just in time to walk in and start
circling the swap area.  There was quite a bit of buying going on.  At
one point early on, there was a guy way down at the end drawing a bit of
a crowd.  Not to be left out I wandered down to see the Kotch clan
throwing 100.00 dollar bills around like monopoly money!  Wow when thoes
folks see something they want they buy!  Saw Bob pick up a set of 51
split window (bug ) crotch coolers, and his partner gobbling up glove
box trim (early split bug).  Swapper tip of the month: Know thy buyer. 
I think someone should print up a roster of all the BIG  players with
pictures of their faces....much like a program at the ball park :-) 
That way you can say hi.  Anyway, I did manage to grab quite a few
things for the 65 as well as pick up a few things for fellow lister
Matt.

I was proudly wearing my Hawaiian shirt, but not one lister came up and
said hello...guess I looked a little tooo weird.  I did manage to
introduce myself to Clara and have a nice brief little chat.  BTW thanks
for the gas lid lock Clara!  As I was putting some parts in the water
pumper up in the parking lot, I spotted Mr. Van Bondo entering the event
and waived.  Later on we bumped into each other in the swap and he told
me that on the way up he had a little excitement...like close to a fire
in the electrical system, but I'll let him give you the details.  BTW he
won best camper...of course....way to go Jim!

The show was great, although the raffel took forever!  Lots of T2's of
all sorts.  I spoke with quite a few people, but only the above
listees.  I was also trying to guage the value of the 56, and spoke with
some oval owners as well as introducing my self to Mr. Bill Collins (of
long distance Heb. driving fame) who gave me some good advice re: the
value of the little oval.   After a very long day I decided not to stay
for the Sunday event at SIR and head back home.

Sunday was a non VW day.  On Monday, my wife, daughter and myself
decided that the 56 was worth another look.  I'm glad I did.  While this
car is very solid, its not as low milage as I first thought.  I
originally thought that it had only its displayed 14000 kilometers(71250
miles) on it.  In talking with the owner and looking at it further it
most likely is 114000K.  Still relatively low milage, but not like
finding a 42 year old car with 8750 miles on it.  I found a leaking
wheel cylinder and it needs axel boots as well as rechroming the bumpers
and new rubber and a good respray.  Nothing big, but it is
$8500...needless to say I still don't own an oval...yet ;-) !

  While I was there, I dropped off the block off plate I had picked up
at the swap to my now friend for life mechanic.  Boy was he happy...I
traded him for a ignition switch for my 65.  He then proceede to show me
a deluxe hardtop walkthrough that someone is trying to sell.  It is
mostly all there including the 2/3 middle seat and all the trim.  On the
down side it has  funky front seats and a dual port motor...pinhole rust
on front floor and window frame rust on some of the pop-outs.  I think I
can get this for $2500.00 we'll see though.

I need some advice on the 56 from you impartial bus folk.  What do you
think?  Should I scrape up every penny to buy this car as an investment,
or are there others out there like this?  Thanks for listing to my
weekend!  I had a blast!

BTW I'll post later about the guy who came to the NW swap with a small
truck load of NOS bus stuff.  He had bought the NOS stuff from a delear
about 20 years ago to restore his 60 single cab.  NOS bumpers, apron,
safari windows, turn signals, all rubber, Tilt...yes TILT(frame and
canvas)...ALL NOS.  He was trying to sell the truck and the NOS stuff as
a package.  It made some delears at the show REALLY MAD that he would'nt
sell to them.  SCREW THEM though!  This guy wanted it to go to a real
bus fan not split up and sold in pieces.  I'll post the whole story
later.

Steve
