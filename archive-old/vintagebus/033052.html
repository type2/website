&lt;&lt; &lt; all I have is a handwritten bill of sale. This was sufficient in GA, but 
SC
  requires a title to get a vehicle registered.  How do I go about getting a 
 title for my bus? &gt;&gt;
 Hi David,
 Drive or call first to a nearby State and see if you can get it titled 
there. 
  There are also titleing businesses in many states (Especially Arkansas) 
that 
 can do this for a price via the mail.
