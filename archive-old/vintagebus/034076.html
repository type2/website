bilstein does make a coil over shock of good quality.
The problem you will have is with the spring rate that comes on it.
These shocks are designed for support and have a heavy spring rate to
support a vehicle,
You can get different springs but I haven't personally dealt with this.
Also Sway-A-Way makes an awesome shock with a threaded can that will except
coil springs,. I have had these shocks made in custom lengths for me and
special valving, added the coil kits and came up with an awesome shock,
DOWNSIDE $$$$$$$ the shock cost 200 a piece, coil kit 75 per shock and the
springs another 60 or so dollars a piece, then you will have to deal with
clearance problems.
Stay a way from the cheapo coil over you see in the mags, these are light
weight shocks with springs added, the down side of them is the shock blows
out in a short period of time.

if you need more info feel free to call or pmail me

Hi again people. Well today my buddy and I went out and got some cypruss
tree logs. There were eight 10+ft. long logs. I guess they were about 100lbs
each.  My 67 Singlecab hauled it all fine, but could be better and I want to
get it as prepared as possible correclty the first time.  It has front and
rear swaybars, I suppose they are aftermarket?

I am familiar with Boge and KYB shocks, as well as the chaep coilovers, but
I want to really beef up the suspension.  Does anyone know if you can get
Boge Turbo Gas shocks, Bilsteins, Konis, or a quality coilover or shock that
will give better performance to a singlecab gone working truck/atv
campmobile?

If anyone knows where and or what, please let me know. Thanks folks.
