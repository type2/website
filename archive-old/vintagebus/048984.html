I love seeing this stuff.  

Here's a '60 Westy for sale, restored.  Center table appears to be missing, forward cabinet (the one the breadbox sits on) appears to be missing, claims to have original curtains but look far from original, no icebox cabinet (o.k. it was an option), huge speaker cut into the closet, funky tuck and roll velour front seat covers, I'll stop here.  Price......$18,500.  Can be seen at:

Don't get me wrong, I'm not dissing the bus at all.  What does amaze me is that here is yet another example of a bus that has been restored, far from the way I would do it if I were going to go to the effort of doing it, and priced with a pretty hefty tag.  I'm not trying to start another custom vs. stock flame war.  I just want us all to continue to be reaffirmed that our beloved buses are becoming very valuable, no matter what's been done to them.  Granted this is the asking price, who knows, it may sell for $20,500.

I was also looking in the L.A. Times classifieds this morning and saw a private collector's ad selling off his vehicles.  Ferraris, Porsches, Mercedes, T-Birds.  One of his most expensive cars was a '49 Split Window, $25,000. 

To each his own, just make sure and keep yours, or at least one!

Robert
