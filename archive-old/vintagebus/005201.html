Hi all,
Was someone looking for some windshield washer outlets a couple of days
ago????  I just returned from the bone yard getting a cargo door latch to
scavenge parts to fix mine in my double cab and I pulled the two little
outlets out of the 62 that's out there.  There were a few hoses attached but
nothing else....(maybe I left the switch but I can't remember).  They appear
to be in nice shape.

Anyway, if this was you and you would like them,  let me know.

David
