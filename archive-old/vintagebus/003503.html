Hi All,

I just came across a strange coincidence....

Last night I was working a bit more on my front beam and I was going through
the trays of bolts to find the four 12mm x 50mm (17mm hex head) bolts that
secure the link pins to the torsion arms.  I ended up finding 3 Rasche and 2
Dorn bolts.... The Rasche had the hole for the cotter pin and the Dorn did
not.  Hmmm I thought, maybe my chrome guy lost one of the Rasche bolts and
the two Dorn go some place else.  So today at lunch, I decided to go out to
the bone yard that has a 62 to find a matching Rasche before I email my
friend that pulls bolts for me in his bone yard in *crisis situations* such
as this.  I arrived, told the guy at the counter I needed to go pull a part
and went out there.  This particular 62 has the front beam and hubs but no
tires or rims.  I knelt down on the passenger side and wiped the dirt from
the top arm bolt.... 'Dorn' it said and I said 'damn'.  Now, for some
reason, I decided to go over to the other side and look there and what did I
find???? Yes, 'Rasche'!!! I was ecstatic.  So, I proceeded to pull both
bolts from the drivers side arms... and they were both Rasche!  So, I went
around to the other side and pulled the bottom arm bolt and it too was a
Rasche...  COINCIDENCE??????  To further mystify the situation, the Dorn
didn't have the cotter pin hole and the Rasche did.

So, who's willing to go out and check their king pin to torsion arm
bolts??????

By the way, when I showed the guy at the counter what I had picked from his
bus, he laughed at me.... this seems to be a reoccurring situation every
time I go out there for a bolt... go figure ;-)
