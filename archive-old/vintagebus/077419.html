Subject: Re: [VB] 1500 and 1600 interchangeability

Dood, you just said the H case is a good running motor.  

FWIW it may be a 1600, if it was ever top end rebuildt, the heads are the same 1500/1600, just if they put a new set of 1600 ps&amp;cs in.  Ever try to get new 1500cc (NOT big bore 40hp )ps&amp;cs?   Not that easy.   

Anyway, just change the oil and adjust the valves when you oughta, or even chaneg the oil early if it gets dirty.   I have had good luck with mystery motors as long as they came to me w/ decent compression, no excessive end play. 

If you feel like spending money or having a spare motor handy, use a later alloy dual relief case for the next motor.   I suggest SP for reliability, but others will say go DP for power.   DP heads, well, they dont like me.  Ya full flow is good.   

So since that type 3 block has low compression (under 100 is low) why don't you check the end play. Write it down.   Then loosen crank pulley nut and FW nut  (read yr Muir and Bentleys) tear it down to the long block, then remove the heads and inspect for crack between plug holes and valves.  At your leisure you can clean up (repaint?) the tin

remove the ps and cs and do the ring in the cylinder test (as per Muir)  are the cylinder walls scored?

check slop on the connecting rods. remove the rods and check the wear on the rod bearings.   If the lower end is good you can get new rod bearings and pcs and cs and heads (or new rings and heads depending) heads are cheap last time I looked.

or get someone else to rebuild it.   But it'll be neat to take it apart and see some of the workings inside.

Read the Muir engine rebuild chapter. 

the thing is, people aren't going to give you much for a core motor ( I wish, I have extra cores)

&gt; Hi all - What, if any components from an H case sp 1500 with an 
&gt; alternator can be fitted on a new 1600 dp longblock?  Here's my 
&gt; situation:
&gt; 
&gt; I have two complete motors in the garage.  One is an H case 1500 sp 
&gt; with a single carb,  vac advance, good heater boxes, new muffler,  fuel 
&gt; pump, and alternator -  runs strong with good compression,  but is of 
&gt; unknown origin, since it came in the dblcab I bought last May.  I 
&gt; popped it in my 65 EZ Camper, and drove it around town all summer.
&gt; 
&gt; The other is an X case type3 motor 1600 dp, with dual Kadrons, and a 
&gt; full flow oil filter.  This one ran rough when I last ran it about 2 
&gt; years ago, compression in the high 90's and 100's, 009, old generator, 
&gt; rotted heater boxes, holy exhaust, etc.
&gt; 
&gt; What I would love to do is get a rebuilt 1600 long block from one of 
&gt; the well respected builders mentioned on the list, and then keep one of 
&gt; these two motors as a &quot;spare longblock&quot;, and use some of the parts like 
&gt; the tin, fan shroud, carb(s) etc. on the rebuilt long block.
&gt; 
&gt; One of these complete motors will be sold to help finance the new 
&gt; longblock.
