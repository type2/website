Subject: Re: Help BusDepot Donate to Tsunami Victims

My personal opinion is that the best thing that we, as a collective, can do is
to contact our Senators and Congress Representatives indicating support for an
increased amount total toward aid to the victim countries and associated
victims.

Senator Patrick Leahy (D - VT) was quoted by National Public Radio (12/30/2004)
as saying that the initial dollar amount promised to the entire relief effort
equaled at or less than the amount of monies speint (by the USA) before dawn
every single day in Iraq. He mentioned that the figure was indicative of the
Administration's lack of comprehension of the scope of this tragic event.

REGARDLESS of political party, the relative percentage of National budget
allocated to this and other humanitarian efforts compared to the cost of war is
flatout embarrassing. Just my opinion.

I prefer to build people up rather than blowing them up. National Defense
should be non-offensive. see http://   the cost of war dot com [leave out the
spaces and substitute dot for the usual format].

Kudos and best wishes to Ron and the BusDepot for the well intentioned efforts.
God bless you- everyone
Jim Ellis
