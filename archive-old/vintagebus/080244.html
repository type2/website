Subject: Re: [VB] Bicycle mounting

Use the canvas hooks on the gates with bungies lengthened just right!  Or
tied but try and stay away from the middle of the gates and not to much pull
on those hooks!   You would not believe how much force it takes sometimes to
get the canvas on so I doubt if they would break unless they are rusty!
Could always put a bay bumper hitch on and carry it on a bike holder there
but I wouldn't trust that and would block your engine bay unless it was a
folding rack!

&gt; Today I pick up my new '60 Single Cab
My question involves ways to carry two mountain bikes
&gt; with me to the mountains. I've seen images of Single Cabs with bikes
&gt; standing in the bed before, and I'd like to do the same but I would do
&gt; almost anything to avoid drilling holes into the bed
