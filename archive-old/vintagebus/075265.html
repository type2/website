Subject: Early doghouse? Trivia buffs read on!

Here is a very interesting find in the boneyard today!

First let me ask, was there ever a steel offset doghouse cooler before the 
AL cooler came along?

I am not really sure, but I did see a factory VW offset plate for a steel 
(normal pre-doghouse cooler) oil cooler that used 8mm oil holes (instead of 
the later 10mm).  The part number started with 040 which I thought was odd, 
cannot remember the rest nor do I carry writing utinsils to the junkyard.  
The oil cooler had been modified to be a little wider by adding side plates 
of steel and had the &quot;Hoover bit&quot; welded on which was interesting.  And the 
quality was top notch so no backyard creation either for the doubting 
Thomas's of the group.

I had half a mind to buy it, but I would never use it so I left it for the 
next guy.  I would have if it were 10mm oil lines though :)  The &quot;H&quot; case I 
have sitting around I just do not trust enough for a daily driver with the 
small oil holes.

Take Care,
Adrian Pillow
