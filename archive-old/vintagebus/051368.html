Subject: [BSKA] Hoopty Doo?


I'm in the process of lining up some projects to work on during the summer
while
I'm off on break.  One of my consulting customers is a large metal
fabrication
outfit and the owner bugging me about the repo hoops on my double cab.  (Not
exact, etc).  He keeps saying &quot;when are you going to let me build you up
some
correct ones?, you get the design and I'll build it&quot;.

Is there any interest in sets of repo hoops being made that are damn near
duplicates of original ones?

Scott
