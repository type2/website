&gt; Also for about 3-4 dollars you can p/u ceramic magnets at your local
&gt; hardware store. The 3/4&quot; size you get 8 magnets at Lowes and then you use
&gt; some JB Weld and glue them to the plug. I use them in the trans, rgb's and
&gt; my engine. they are much stronger than OG mag plugs.

Hi Bob,
Interesting idea!  We just would be a bit nervous that the JB Weld would come 
loose just once and possibly the magnet would somehow get between the gears!  
Mayhaps one could find magnets of simular size with a hole through them to be 
able to bolt them to the plugs.......
