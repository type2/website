When the time came for new ones for the '55, I couldn't find any
NOS or good used ones, so I bought a pair of the repros, took the chrome
off with a wire wheel, painted them black, then backed them in the oven
for several hours _at_ ~200

Came out looking powder coated or NOS.

&gt; As the weather gets colder the need for vent wing latches on my Binz gets 
&gt; greater.  Noticed it was quite a chilly ride in this morning!!  Would love to 
&gt; have NOS but anything in good shape will do.  Not sure which years would be 
&gt; correct.  Need both left and right.  Any help appreciated!
