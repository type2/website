Hello All

	I was wondering who or where is the best place to get vintage seat belts
for my 67 deluxe. I have one seat belt on the rear seat none on the middle
and two on the front seats. I also would like to know where they are
supposed to be mounted on the rear two seats. If any one could help me I
would appreciate it. I would like others to ride with me as safe as possible
:-)

Thanx
