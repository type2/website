Subject: Re: [VB] Air Vent on a 63 singlecab ??'s

This is all you need to know: The setscrews dont touch the flat part of the
bar they touch the *opposite* side of the bar.
The flat spot actually mates with the bracket piece on the flap which has a
flat spot as well. I can post a pic if that doesnt make sense. Will have a
write up shortly on my site since im in the process of doing one now on my
57

&gt;I replaced the rubber gasket around the air vent on my singlecab, but I do
&gt;not seem to be able to get it back together in a manner that makes sense.
&gt;The lever on the driver's side seems to have to be down for it to go into
the
&gt;shut position. Does the bar that goes across with the flat bits for the
&gt;screws to hold onto have alternate positions?
&gt;Does anyone have any pictures of what it should look like with the cover
&gt;taken off?
