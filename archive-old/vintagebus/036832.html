&lt;&lt; Hi List!
 
 Does anybody know if the distance from the center of the torsion bar to the 
 center of the &quot;main&quot; drive shaft is the same for busses and bugs?
 
 Thanks!

I am wondering where this question comes from.  ANyway, the suspension is 
different, don't know if that distance is the same, and do you mean the 
steering coloumn by the &quot;main drive shaft&quot;?  Barndoors are more similar to 
bugs with the unequal tie rod lengths than the later splits, but it isn't the 
same thing.
