&gt;What would happen if I had 15&quot; rims on the back end and had 14&quot; up front?
&gt;Steve



You would get great gas milage!  As you would be going down hill all the
time! hahaha! I couldn't resist!

but seriously,, it really doesn't matter the rims size,, the tire diameter
could be the same ... and I think I smell a FART about tires and rims that
is probably answered a million times in the Archives,  [thats a zillion
Canadian!]

:-)
Just Drive em!
