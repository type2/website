Let's start with the moral of the story: do your own work. Having said that,
I will give the oily details.

About ten days ago I dropped the '67 off at the local shop to have the gear
oil in the tranny and the RGB changed because (a) I suspected that it had
not been done in 20 years and (b) I really didn't want to get all dirty and
smelly. On Saturday I noticed and odd pattern of oil stain in the driveway
but think to much of it because the bus had been parked in all sorts of
crazy positions over the last week thus disrupting the usual pattern of
markings.

On Sunday the entire family loaded up in the '67 for 120 mile round trip the
the in-laws for a post x-mas gathering. After the lunch feast I went out to
the driveway for a smoke and noticed something truly strange. Puddles of
gear oil had formed in front of and behind the left rear tire. Upon closer
inspection there was gear oil splattered inside the wheelwell. So I crawled
under the bus for a closer look and the RGB was covered in oil! The litany
of profanities was shocking to those in ear shot. 60 miles form home,
gearbox pukes everywhere and realatives and family are begining to wonder
why I am under the bus while I am supposed to be inside conducting
pleasantries with the in-laws.

After the intial panic, I began to search for the source of the leak and
much to my surprise the filler plug on the RBG was almost all the way
unthreaded. Gear oil has been sloshing out around the threads. I am amazed
the the plug did not work its way out while we were on the road. 

My brother-in-law John was nice enough to run me to the parts store for some
more gear oil and a pump. Upon our return, the subject of what to use to
tighten the plug came up. In the adsence of a 17mm allen wrench we were
forced to inprovise. A 17mm bolt the acts as the seatbelt anchor bolt was
inserted with just enough head sticking out to get a box wrench on it. The
pump I bought was a P.o.S so I ended up pouring it out of the bottle. The
RGB had not lost much oil but what it did loose created a terrible mess on
the box, brake baking plate, the tire, the rim and the wheel weel and not to
mention me :) 

We made it home last night without any further incident but I still seem to
be leaking a bit of gear oil out of both boxes and a smidgen from the
tranny. Prior to the shop work there was no leak at all. I am going to get a
17mm allen wrench tomorrow and make sure everything is snug. Should I
consider the use of a thread sealant to prevent leaks and losening or will
proper torque take care of it? Also wondering if the use of GL5 is a
contributing factor?
