OK, I'll take a stab at it. I don't have a reputation to worry about
anyway 8^). I think some of that extra play you had was between the
bearing and the case. Since the engine turns, you obviously have
*some* clearance, but I'm betting it's less than the .0035&quot; you saw on
your indicator. Maybe it's little enough that the engine gets tight
when it gets warmed up. I don't know if end play gets tighter, looser
or stays the same when the engine heats up, but I think I would set
the play back to .008&quot; and just drive the engine until it needs a
rebuild. I've seen engines lock up tight but still have end play
because of worn out thrust surfaces on the case.
