I spent today replacing the battery tray and cutting-out the corner below
(dissolved by battery acid, I presume)  in my '65 crew cab.

Does anyone know how the battery is normally restrained in a stock set-up?
The battery tray I got from Bulli-Haus has a 3/8 inch hole drilled in the
tray surface about 3 inches from the edge in the middle of the tray and has
something that looks like a upside-down &quot;J&quot; opposite on the other side of
the tray
