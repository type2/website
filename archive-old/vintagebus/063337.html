&gt;I've pulled apart a bunch of junk yard engines and see a lot of
&gt;debris and oil bound dirt caked on the cyls and heads.  So... Did
&gt;VW have any preventive maintenance tips for this problem?

I don't know of anything specific but it was probably along the
lines of &quot;fix your oil leaks and this won't be a problem&quot;.  I
can see the cylinders getting dusty, but if there's no oil in
the cooling air it's hard for much else to stick to them.

&gt;How about an atomized solvent at the front of the shroud?  Warm
&gt;up the engine, remove the fan belt, use a drill to turn the fan
&gt;and watch the cascade of debris.

I wonder about the cool solvent hitting warm cast iron and
aluminum alloy.  If the engine isn't super hot it's probably
OK but it might better to warm the solvent first.

&gt;Tape off the heater tubes, or would cleaning the debris out of
&gt;the head exchangers be a Good Thing.

It might be a Good Thing *if* you disconnected the heater box
to body tubes and capped off the body tubes.  You _will_ smell
any solvent you spray into the ducts for a while, and spraying
down the windshield with it is probably not a good idea.

&gt;Hmmm, use an ammeter on the drill to measure air resistance
&gt;before and after treatment.

Or plumb in the airflow meter from a later model fuel-injected car...
