 want to know if i just have to add a resistor on my 12 V system to work !!

you should not use a regular voltage drop, as radios are more picky about 
their electricity than wiper motors.  There is a device, I think it's called 
a voltage inverter or something, that you can wire in between the hot 12V and 
the lead into the radio, that changes the voltage appropriately.  It is 
marked on it what it is and which way you hook it up.  I have used one of 
these to power a 12V stereo in a 6V bus, but I used an old one, don't know 
where you can buy one new.  I dont doubt they are made the other direction.   
Any one else?
