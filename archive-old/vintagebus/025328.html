&gt; okay true or false-   all 67 bugs are 12V?


To No-Name:

No!

6 Volt Bugs were sold as late as modelyear 1975! I had one.
In the end only the german postal service and the military got these.

A regular officially into the US imported Bug should be 12 V though.

The US always got the best stuff, which is not always the most
collectable nowadays. In Germany you could get a 67 Bug with a cloth
sunroof if you ordered the standard model. How cool is that. And very
rare.
