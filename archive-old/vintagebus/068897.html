Subject: NEATO Recruitment

    I would like to talk about the new NEATO newsletter.  NEATO has been
working hard on getting the club back to its former glory and they are in a
recruitment effort right now. They have not raised there rates in 12 years and
they need to.   As of March 31 of this year rates for membership will go from
$20 to $28 for 1 year, $37 to $54 for 2 years and $50 to $80 for 3 years.
NEATO has promised that they will not raise there rates for at least 3 years.
Now if you do subscribe please let them know that I got the NEATO fire under
your butt and they will extend my subscription by 1 issue.  Tell them Rob
Laffoon sent you.   I am not affiliated with them in any way but love the new
look and just thought I would pass the rate increase info on to you.  Plus
maybe I will get a couple free issues and with my $50 bucks 3 year
subscription I will have a new stack of VW mags to sort through.
Thanks   NEATO info here http://www.neatoclub_dot_org/
