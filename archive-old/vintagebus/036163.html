for replacing fuel line

istead of pulling the line off and then looking for a plug, I have the plug (I
use a pencil, some peope  use golf tees, i even have a cool thing made for
this purpose) to stick in the line handy.   I take it, and a rag with me, and
my needle nose vice grips  to the gas line.   Lightly vise grip line, wiggle
hose off metal pipe, plug ine, undo vise grips.   Rag handy in case of drips.
I dont like the vise grips because of fear of crushing line (decrease
durability?)  but is better than washing my head in gasoline.

Also, when pulling, installing motor, I drop the engine down onto the jack
first, then I can reach ove rthe motor to undo (or redo ) the fuel line.  Is
easier with motor sitting on jack in engine compartment than when bolte d to
the tranny, as you dont need to be under neath.
