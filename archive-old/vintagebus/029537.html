Subject: 12v 9pin dammit box

It's time to replace the dammit box that controls all functions relating
to lighting.  First my high beams wouldn't go off.  Then I had no
lights.  Finally after much clicking of the switch I was able to get low
beams and left it at that.  Turn signals are getting crusty so it's
time.  Who has/where can I find the DIY schematics using mortal relays?

Searched the archives and the major vendor sites, could be the search
engines don't recognize dammit but I still need one...

Mad Uncle Dave
