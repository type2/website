Subject: Stale air heat hooked up

I live in Phoenix, Arizona, why do I need heat?  Guess I don't if I was a
real man but it's been between 31 and 50 F when I go to work and my doors
leak cold air like a sieve, so decided I needed to suck on some stale air.

For those who don't know what I mean by stale air, the heat in the early
Buses is run by the same air that actually cools your engine.  I believe
this was up to about the end of '62 or so, when stale-air 40 hp engines
stopped.  After the fan pushes the air over the cylinders, it passes into
the heater boxes which then pipe it directly into the cabin of your Bus.

Anyway, sounds like a bad idea, doesn't it?  I've heard lots of rumors
before, it smells real bad, you suck on exhaust fumes, etc., etc..  Well, I
think with a clean engine and a heating system in good order, everything is
same as a later Bus because mine smells fine to me.  I don't think I've
blacked out yet, but last Thursday is kind of shady.

Hooked up the passenger side real easy as all the parts were there, cable
good, flap sticking a little so I cranked it  open for the duration of
winter.  Driver's side was a little more difficult as I have a later 36 hp
heater box installed so the rod for the heater flap does not line up.  Plus,
some DPO cut the heater cable off.  Decided to wedge the rod around the flap
mounting spot, holding the flap about 2/3rds closed (heat 2/3rds open).
Good enough until I can install a &quot;correct&quot; heater box and get an extension
for the heater cable.   Pulled off the short metal tube that goes from the
body to the flexible hose (which then travels rear-ward to the heater box)
and noticed it looked a little dirty, full of dead bugs and some other gross
stuff.  Sprayed it out with the hose and was going to put it back on when I
decided that the insulation installed inside it would probably not dry out
with the cold weather.  Allrighty, straight to the kitchen where I fired up
the oven and baked it on &quot;warm&quot; for 15 minutes.  A lot of water came out of
it so I let it drain and put it back in at 250 for another 5 minutes.  Real
nice and dry now.

Went to install everything on the passenger side and noticed that the &quot;exit
port&quot; on the later heater box also juts further toward the front (FIF) of
the Bus so the stock flexible metal tube was too long.  Picked up some paper
fan shroud tubing at my local FLAPS and cut it to length, then wrapped it in
fiberglass insulation and duct tape.  Installed it with some clamps and took
the Bus for a drive.  Heat!

Now if I just had a cab divider...  maybe I'll make one, anybody got any
extra cab divider glass laying around, preferably large letter Sekurit?
Yeah, right...

Later,
