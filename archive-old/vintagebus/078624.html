Subject: Re: [VB]up in smoke - survey

My '69 Dormobile burned, totaled the vehicle, but the engine and tranny
were spared.  The firewall worked!
My home burned and the bus was 6ft away from the garage in the driveway.

The first few pix at:

show the damage.
It took the fire dogs 20mins to get there after the neighbors called,
that's why there was so much damage.
