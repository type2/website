Subject: Bentley Manual Update


I just talked to Stan from Bentley Publishing.  He *is*
working on the pre-63 book, but it's a background kind of
project that he works on in his free time in between Audi
and late-model VW books.  He's about 2/3 of the way thru
the initial work-up of the book, and called me to verify a
couple of tidbits of info.  Once he's done with the workup,
they'll camera prep the OG manuals and do some manipulation
magic to incorporate additional details, then it's ready for
printing.  He'd like to have it ready by summer, but he's
not making any promises.

Thanks again for the support!
