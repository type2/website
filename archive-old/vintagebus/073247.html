&gt; &gt; I'm not even sure that people who restore a bus to

I think I'd have to agree with that.
It's a bit like obsessive golfers or target shooters.
Seeking to obtain &quot;perfection&quot;,or whatever that is.
They search &amp; search and accumulate those NOS parts so
that hopefully that next project will be &quot;just like it
rolled off the production line&quot;.
Which of course is absurd.
The workers at Wolfsburg surely didn't check that each
bus or car had bolts from the correct order or tack
welds to within 2mm of spec.
It's like Concourse Jaguar, where cars are restored
not to their production line spec, but to their blue
print specs.
Sure they run like a dream, but don't start 'em up too
often or you might get grease in the engine bay &amp;
destroy any chance of winning the title.
If Rainman built VWs it'd be complete &quot;restorations&quot;.
Personally I like the term resto-custom.
Let's face it.
Heinz Nordhoff &amp; his team of designers continually
fine tuned VW models.
Let's be realistic about &quot;restoring&quot; our buses so they
handle &amp; run well.
:o)
Cheers &amp; God Bless
