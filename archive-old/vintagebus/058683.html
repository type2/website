Subject: Re: [VB] 6 volt to 12 volt conversion, is it that easy?

I actually took a grinder to my housing in one of my bus conversions.  You 
should have seen the sparks fly....  Must have been the magnesium.

&gt;I'm going to try to remember all the crap I leaned and pass it on, so you
&gt;guys out there who really know your stuff be kind in your corrections.
&gt;
&gt;Is your transmission the original (6 volt)? If it is you will have to cut
&gt;some clearance in the bell housing. This is not hard to do. If you put in
&gt;the engine and hook up the electrical, take the wire off the coil so it
&gt;won't start, put in the bolts just a little, turn the engine over just a
&gt;little. The hard steel flywheel will cut into the soft metal of the bell
&gt;housing and show you where to cut. You can actually continue to tighten,
&gt;turn the engine and cut the metal to compltion, but that made me nervous.
&gt;You will also need a special bushing on the starter. It is thicker than the
&gt;standard 6volt one. A 12 volt starter for an automatic will eliminate that
&gt;hassle.
&gt;
&gt;Did I do right, guys?

&gt;
&gt;
&gt; &gt; Thanks Thom.  So, let me see if if I understand the article.  My 12 Volt
&gt;engine is turnkey complete, so it already has a 12 volt generator (or is it
&gt;alternator?), coil, and choke, no problem there.  So according to the info,
&gt;I should be able to put the 6 volt flywheel and clutch onto the 12 volt
&gt;engine, then simply put the engine into the 1966 bus and use existing 6 
&gt;volt
&gt;starter and bell housing configuration and operate the bus off of a 12 volt
&gt;power source?  That seems WAY too easy, am I missing something?  What about
&gt;voltage regulator, that would have to be change to a 12 Volt, right?
&gt;Obviously all bulbs, relays, etc would need to be switched over, but there
&gt;has got to be something I'm not thinking of, otherwise it's too simple!
&gt; &gt; Thanks, John Baker

&gt; &gt; &gt; OK, I have a good 12 Volt 1600 Dp engine which I want to put into a 6

&gt;12 volt engine?  What else would need to be changed out?  Voltage
