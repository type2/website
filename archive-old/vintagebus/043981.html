Bob, and all the others with engine related tech questions.....include
some additional info related to your application for the rest of us to
digest as we ponder the possibilities of your predicaments.
What dizzy, carb, exhaust system, stats, stock or modified components,
etc. etc. etc. etc.
Often, with so many components so readily exchanged on these vehicles, one
thing leads to another and the problems become trickle down.  Or worse..
later
