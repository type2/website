&gt;there is a cross over point between HP and longevity.(.....)
&gt;When you change anyone of these constants then you lose something. If you up
&gt;the HP then you lower the life expectancy. I draw the line at 70 reliable HP
&gt;with my mix of parts (.....)
&gt;You can blue print a 1600 and it may last a month if the materials used were
&gt;bad. (......)
&gt;too much info makes my head hurt

Ya, me too. But the question at hand concerns your choice
of low ( and even lower ) CR for engine longevity. So, OK, then-
Just how low can you go ? Should a big bore engine be tuned
to run on kerosene ? ( A 1641 is not a big bore, it's an overbore:).
What is your &quot;optimal &quot; CR,  why does it lower for bore increase ,
and what is the approximate optimal length of life for the chosen CR ?

&gt;Groovy. I'm too lazy tonite to go do the math, but it appears you
&gt;are seeking lower CR as you increase bore size with this theory,
&gt;and have three different CR values for these three engines.
&gt;Longevity ( a good thing ) is sacrificing horsepower ( another good thing ).
&gt;You have stated your preferences for CR with factory parts tolerances.
&gt;Would you be willing to offer a little more power to the blueprinter ?
