&lt;&lt; Has anyone done and been driving a 12-6 set up like this with long term 
good results or not?  Any ideas...I wanna cover all options before I pull the 
engine and start over. &gt;&gt;
Hi Todd,
Yes, we have!  For over at least 150,000 collective miles!  We use a 12 volt 
solinoid in place of the 6 volt one to cut down on the slam effect the 6 volt 
solinoid seems to have on 12 volts.  You also want to make sure that the 
bushing press fits into the tranny case and the starter tip is still slightly 
loose inside it then.  Might also check for any mushrooming of the FW teeth 
from any starter pounding which would then cause binding.  Any mushrooming 
needs to be cured with a hand file by beveling the forward side of the teeth 
and is a good idea to bevel any teeth that just has a flat forward surface.
We never have liked the paper thin bushings due to the much smaller hole in 
the later trannies.   Eric&amp;Barb
