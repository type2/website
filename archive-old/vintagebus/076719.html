Subject: Re: [VB] Blocked heat riser?

I used this method with the manifold still in the bus, and it worked great
to clear out the heat risers.  Thanks.

&gt; keep in mind that when I did this the manifold was off the engine. I
&gt; took a piece of old clutch cable and put it on the end of a power
&gt; drill. then fed it through the riser while running it. I kept spraying
&gt; carb cleaner in there as well, and w/out much work got it cleaned out
&gt; pretty decent. HTH
