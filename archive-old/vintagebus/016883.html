I've said it before, and I'll say it again.  Most bus people are cheepskates.
I think it's part of the bus tradition.

What's ironic are the fiscal extremes: bus people will pay WAY more for a part
on ebay when it's listed a &quot;bus&quot; part when in reality it's a crossover part.
Then others nickel and dime their cars to death, trying to re-filament burned
out dome light bulbs and such nonsense.  I've seen someone spend $1000+ to
put safaris and an ambulance fan in a POS bus, but won't put new brakes on it
when it needed it.

&gt; to bash Ebay but their unwillingness to pay a reasonable price for something. 
&gt;  I had the NOS German front bumper for sale on the list for several weeks.  
&gt; When folks Emailed for details I told them it was worth at least $200 but I 
&gt; would take significantly less.  Just checked my RMMW catalog today and a 
&gt; *repro* bumper is $315.
