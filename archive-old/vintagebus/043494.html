&gt;Not really a bus question, but I'm stumped. I was hoping someone could
&gt;tell me(or tell me where I could find out) what vehicle a wiper motor
&gt;with part # 0 390 246 050 would come from. Ordered a thing motor(for
&gt;friend even) and got one with this number.

That looks suspiciously like a Bosch part number.  A Thing-specific
VW part number would probably begin with 181, but as the wiper motor
was probably something they were already using on a Bus, Bug, or Type III,
it's more likely to have something like a 113, 211, or 311 VW part number.
A lot of electrical bits made by Bosch have both Bosch and VW part
numbers.

Someone with a VW parts book or possibly a Bosch service center could
look it up for you.
