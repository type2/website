Subject: RE: [VB] Non-Stock Muffler and Engine Temp

Hey, John, with all those newly opened up manifolds we
did the other day, let's just cut the top off one and
weld on the appropriate flange as a test!

&gt; &gt; For a single port, it would seem like a relatively
&gt; easy job to fabricate a
&gt; &gt; SP manifold to accommodate the 34 carburator.  I
&gt; hate to see a single port
&gt; &gt; motor stuck with a dual-port manifold and the
&gt; accompanying vacuum leaks at
&gt; &gt; the boots.
&gt; 
&gt; The reason for the dual port manifold is to get some
&gt; better flow.  On a
&gt; stock or probably even 69X88 the stock SP manifold
&gt; is probably adequate
&gt; but I'm thinking 74X88 would probably be pushing it.
&gt;  The end pieces are
&gt; bigger than the stock SP so would flow better in
&gt; theory.  The SP heads can
&gt; be opened up some and they have the same valve sizes
&gt; as the dual port so
&gt; for a bigger engine this should be a good set-up in
&gt; theory.
&gt; I've rarely had intake leaks on dual port intakes
&gt; using the silicone one
&gt; piece boots and not overtightening.  Like I said
&gt; Rarely.  Not never.:)
&gt; I think leaks were due to overtightening.  Good
&gt; German clamps help too.
&gt; There is a VW mechanic running the DP/SP combination
&gt; on a 1776 in a 71 bus
&gt; going through Tijeras canyon every day and he swears
&gt; by it.  He also has
&gt; some oldtime single port adapters that work.  ANyway
&gt; I'd like to try it if
&gt; anybody has some good adapters I'd buy some.
