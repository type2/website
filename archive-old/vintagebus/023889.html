Subject: 1500 H case questions

Dear collective,

I'm currently pondering the &quot;what engine should I put in the 65 Westy&quot;
question.  I think that I want to keep it as stock as I can, so I guess
that means single port.  The 65 had an H case 1500 in it originally.  

The motor that came out of it is an AE 1600SP which I've not yet
examined.  It turns freely, and seems to have compression (how much is
still a mystery) but thats all I know.  

My question is this:  Should I go out and search for  a rebuildable &quot;H&quot;
case to keep it totally original, or if the AE case is good just build a
runner on that?   I know that the later case has the dual oil relief
valves.  Is it that much better than the 1500 H?  BTW I plan on making
the motor a 1641 and I still want to use the stock carb and vac dizzy.

Thanks for any input!

Steve
