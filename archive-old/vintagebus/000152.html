&lt;&lt; Makes me wonder, if you put the same proportioned tires on the front and
 back, would the 1 inch difference be visable? Would the one inch lowered

Hi Rex,
If the tire proportions were exactly the same then there would be only 1/2&quot; 
lowered front.  Probably not enough for most to notice.  Remember that the 
rim measurement is Dia. not radius.  Eric&amp;Barb
