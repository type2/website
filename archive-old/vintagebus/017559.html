&gt;  who would have made this sort of thing?  I realize
&gt; its in Brazil... but
&gt;  would this have been available through places like
&gt; JC Whipme back in the
&gt;  day? or.._dot_dealer?
&gt;  just curious... I like it. &gt;&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; That's a kool accessory, but I wanna know what's up
&gt; with the bus that's 
&gt; modeling the steps? I never seen ribs where
&gt; someone's put on an over rider 
&gt; tube.
