hello all,

Lately the list has been all about e-bay it seems... and i must admit i
have posted a couple of times on this topic.

But, its not against the rules... and it probably should be to some
extent.  T2 has an ebay moratorium &amp; i think that is a good idea, or at
least make e-bay a friday topic, that would probably be the best
compromise...

Now, many of you sell stuff on e-bay and are saying &quot;i dont want to lose
my ability to announce auctions to the people most liekly to buy stuff,
and i sometimes want to start auctions on days other than friday.&quot;

And that is a good argument BUT this list has lost a lot of good smart
people over the out of hand stuff that has gone on... the bob hoover flame
war to name one.  So really at this point it has come time to make a
choice...

Do we want smart people to get fed up and leave at an increasing rate,
leaving the list awash with newbies and bad advice OR do we want to limit
things more and retain our most valulable asset, people with experience.

How much is making more money on our e-bay auctions really worth? IF the
money is worth more than the list sanity, perhaps i should consider
leaving... (but i'm addicted so thats not likely..)   I would volunteer to
help moderate, as i am sure would others... if the load on thom is too
great... Sharing the load always makes things easier :)

food for thought, 

Steve

p.s. auctions that end on sunday do best, so i've been told... So e-bayers
have your auctions end on sunday and then you can announce them here the
friday b-4 they end.
