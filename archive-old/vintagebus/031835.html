Subject: Cargo doors latch rods?

Question; When did VW change from the thick to the thin cargo door latch
rods? I am not talking about the early ones with the notch, but the later
ones with the screw that holds them to the latch. When going through a pile
of them I have, I noticed 2 different thicknesses of these rods and have
never noticed this before! Parts book demons&gt;start your fingers walking.
