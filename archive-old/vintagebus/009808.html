I've tried the Bosch platinum plugs in many customer's VW's.  They work
great.  Meaning I've never had any problems with them.  I've run them in my
personal Bus, Bug, and 914 for many years with no problems at all.  However,
I have never noticed any improvement over the regular Bosch plugs!  None,
not gas mileage, power, starting or anything!  I finally switched back to
regular Bosch just to save a few bucks.  Note, it IS IMPORTANT to run the
correct heat range.  A plug that runs too hot will cause pre-ignition which
leads to detonation, (there's a difference between the two), which will not
be a good thing for your engine.  It is the temperature of the plug that
causes the problem.  Not the construction of the electrode.
