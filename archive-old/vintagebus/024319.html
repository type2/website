Hi volks,

Here's my two cents on the gas heater question. I have one in the
crewcab that has been my daily driver for the last four years. In warm
weather (no heater) I get about 22 mpg. When I use the heater I usually
only use it on the morning leg of my commute which is 30 miles of
highway driving. My gas mileage drops under these conditions to about 19
mpg. I have never tuned my heater, so maybe I could get a little better
mileage if I did. In any case, I don't think that small drop in gas
mileage is too much to pay for all that nice warm air. My crewcab is a
lot like that paper bag with holes in it that someone mentioned. I need
all the heat I can get.

Also, there were some questions recently about where to put a heater in
a crewcab. My heater was installed under the back seat by a PO. I think
this is a really bad place for  it. Two holes were cut in the floor for
the cumbustion intake air and exhaust. A huge hole was cut in the metal
under the backseat for the warm air outlet and a dryer vent was
installed in the hole. It's truely hideous, I forgot to send this MX
code in last week. The heater is a bn4 that was probably originally in a
thing.
