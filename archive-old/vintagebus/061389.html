Subject: middle seat seatbelts

Hey everybody...
I have a 67 deluxe, which has the floor mounts for
seatbelts for the middle seat.
My question is: they look like they are a little ways
back behind the seat, so I'm worried that if I mount
seatbelts in there, people getting into the back seat
might trip on them. Plus, I'd have to cut slits in the
rubber floormat.

Anyone have these mounted? Is tripping a problem?
Or, has anyone mounted seatbelts (customly) to the
framework of the middles seat? Like, to the rear leg
of the seat?
That way you could turn the middle seat around
backwards (conference style) and people could still
use the belts.
