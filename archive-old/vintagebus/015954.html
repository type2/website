Any place where a hose ends should be clamped.  Assuming you have the
typical one-filter setup, that means eight clamps:  tank, firewall/
breast tin (front and back), fuel filter (both sides), fuel pump
(inlet and outlet), carb.

Some folks also put a filter between the pump and the carb, which
would add two more clamps.  Use the type that has smooth metal against
the hose, rather than grooves if you can.  The grooved kind is cheaper,
because it's a single piece of metal [the grooves are what the
tightening screw's threads ride in]).  However, it damages the hose,
and can promote leakage.
