Subject: Stereo &amp; Generator ?

greetings...
i am putting some sounds in the bus this spring and am wondering how much my 
12V generator can handle. im sick of the mini, cigarette lighter powered 
AIWA cassette player dangling off the dashboard! i wanted to get a cd head 
unit, but a friend warned that the 100watts or so that they put out may be 
too much.

what kind of radios do y'all have running on your stock 12V buses?

thanks!
