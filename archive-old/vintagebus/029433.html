&gt; Scott, does that thing transmit continuously or every few minutes??
&gt; Pretty neat, but. . . I think some people have a little too much time on
&gt; their hands :)

It is software selectable, I will be setting it up to transmit about every 45
seconds when the power is on, otherwise once every 10-20 minutes.  Most
likely closer to 10 minutes.

Non Friday Bus Content: Of course I have time on my hands, the trans is broke
and in the shop.  I dropped the transaxle off at Rancho Performance
Transaxles and it turns out that a couple of teeth broke off of 1st gear.  So
now I'm having the trans built up to handle the power from the type IV
motor.  This trans was one of unknown history that I just threw in there when
the city was after my truck last year.  It was that move it or lose it
situation.  I got 2000 miles off of the trans before the gear broke.  Trans
should be done around the middle of next week.
