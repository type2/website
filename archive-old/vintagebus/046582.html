 These resuvors *do* come off. The old metal style has a nut inside and the 
 late plastic style has a nut underneath.
 It's probably easier if you don't have a belly pan. But i would'nt know,

 never has had one and probably never will. Crawl under your bus and while 
you 
 are removing it check your master cylinder fittings and seals /boot to see 
if 
 everything is corrosion and leak proof

I tried cleaning a brake reservoir in a parts washer, and it surprised me but
