&lt;&lt; associated with motorcycles. I think they were discussing specifically how
 to connect the wire ends TO the brass/copper push on connectors, not whether
 the wire should use a push on connector OR solder the end of the wire to the
 terminal. I'm not sure which you were wanting an answer to, but I would
 think that soldering a wire to a terminal not only makes it tough to test
 things later when trying to track down electrical gremlins, but also can
 cause a sudden failure of the joint IF soldered joints are indeed prone to
 cracking due to vibration and age. Just MHO.

in 1960 the VWs got push on connectors.  59 and earlier they had screw on 
connectors.   The bit at the end of the wire that the scre sets on often had 
a little end stiuck on the end of the wire, the end of the wire was not 
soldered.  dunno if I am being clear about it, but I believe he was talking 
about the treatment that end of the wire got.    Push on connectors were not 
in the equation.  neither was soldering the wire to the terminal.
