Scott Mc Williams &lt;msscott_at_icnt_dot_net&gt; was kind enough
to notice that Clara Williams and the Ellis clan were
missing from the BBB event.

Thanks, It's nice to be thought of enough to be
considered MIA.
Trust me that our absense was not intended as
politics, personal slight or insult to anyone or
group. The Havasu, Albuquerque, Orange County and the
collective Arizona clubs always put on killer events.
I am just at a point in life in which I need to
refocus on other things. Hopes are to get rested up
and back into the groove somewhat soon. I was/we were
in attendance via the online sites and enjoyed all of
the photos and commentary.
A big thanks to all who promoted, hosted and attended
the event. A special thanks to those who contributed
toward the charities who benefited from their
kindness.
Best wishes to all,
-ellis\
