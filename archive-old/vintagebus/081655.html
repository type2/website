Subject: RE: [VB] door window questions

Unless you have access to the rivet tool for the upper pivot, it's much
easier to set the rivet with the entire window frame off the bus.  

The manual shows the repair using a strip of rubber like we're all
accustomed to today, but look at an original seal and I really wonder if
they had a molded part.

So ... I screwed up my vent windows and got to paint em again ... it is
tough
cutting that rubber behind the swoosh.  I expect it wouldn't be so bad
with
the small swoosh but my 60 has a big swoosh - damn.

Anyway - it seems to me that there would be no problem putting the door
window
frames back into the doors and putting the vent windows in later.  I
guess it
might be a bit awkward bolting the spring and stuff on but ... am I
right?
Would it be hard or impossible to put the vent window in the frame when
the
frame is bolted into the door?
