Hi all,

After pouring over the idiot's guide in the bathroom for over 3 months now...

Question:

John's recomendation on disabling the auto choke, anyone agree / disagree?

I pulled mine, but it's still 80 degrees here daily, so I guess I wont see a
big difference yet.

One more:  Is there a new carb that is a direct replacement for my PICT28-2
(1500cc-converted to 12 V)

Thanks as usual
