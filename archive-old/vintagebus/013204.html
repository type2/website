I don't know if anyone else tries to use this, but www.egroups_dot_com has a place
where events can be listed. You just need to be a member of this list to post.
It seems like a pretty good feature. 

Potentially no overhead. I remeber mentioning this before, but noone seemed
interested or there was a technical problem involved. Any idea Thom?
