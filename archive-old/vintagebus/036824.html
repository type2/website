Hi Rex,
Tell him you want a bus 1967 200mm nine spring pressure plate and 200mm 
center sprung clutch disc.  If he can not find you a nine spring 200mm 
pressure plate talk to Ronnie at: http://www.old-volks_dot_com/  he seems to have 
it listed on his website.  If he does please tell us.  Our FLACPS is not able 
procure any right now.   Thanks, Eric&amp;Barb
