The lightbulb in my license plate light gets quite hot, and I am concerned 

that it will melt the plastic lens (I have seen several lenses melted in this 

manner).  It is still 6 volt and the bulb is similar to the ones used in a 

dome light.  Any ideas on how to dim the bulb??- - - - -

make sure you have the right bulb.  That it is 6V and the right W, which 
should be written on the buln holder.  I thought it was like  the bulb  for 
the front running lights in the headlight.  What is your bus?
