Subject: RE: [VB] Fuchs Wheels again

&gt;Maybe this is a special Fuchs term, but when you see the letter 'J' in a
wheel size (4 bolt VWs use a 4 1/2 J x 15), the 'J' refers to the shape of
the bead seating area.&lt; 

The Fuchs use some sort of letter designation to find the offset.  I am not
horribly familiar with it since I have not needed different wheels.  I can
try to verify this tonight since I need to take off the wheels to change the
brake pads anyway.  I think the standard 911 Fuchs 15x6 should have a 115mm
offset, again do not quote me on that :)  The letter designation should be
near the fox head symbol, if they are repos I have no idea what to look at.

The big thing is to make sure they are not 944 wheels which have a different
offset altogether and I do not think they will work on a bus at all.   The
15&quot; wheels came stock/optional on so many Porsche models that you need to
make sure of what you are getting. 


Good Luck,
