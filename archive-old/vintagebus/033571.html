Kevin and List, 

Well I was just going to pmail you until I saw the admin. chime in on this 
Friday, if at all topic, but who am I to say :-)

From even suggesting 2 inch thickness, it sounds like you might be in a 
southern area, or at least a warm area.  I am an architect in Vermont, and 
here we use 3 or 4 inches typically.  I would not consider 2 inches at all.  
3 inches is for mud slabs which take little if any loads (0 to 40 psf).   4 
inches is typical for residential garages assuming a normal 3000 psi concrete 
mix.   Some of the other posts were confusing reinforcing steel (such as 
rebar) with shrinkage steel (such as wire mesh).  Fiberglass and wire mesh 
are both used to reduce shrinkage stress during the curing process.  These 
stresses will lead to cracks as the concrete cures.  Reinforcing steel is 
used to add tensile strength to the concrete for live loads after curing.  
Reinforcing steel is not normally required in slabs-on-grade, except at 
thickened portions of the slab where medium load carrying bearing walls 
occur.  Heavy bearing walls and columns usually have isolated footings 
separate from the slab.  Fiberglass is mixed with the concrete and is less 
expensive, since there is less labor.  We have had good luck with both 
fiberglass and wire mesh as long as the floor is finish troweled properly.  
As may seem apparent, the load carrying capacity of the soil under the slab 
is critical to the strength of the floor after it has fully cured.  Unless 
you have poor soils, it is best to leave virgin soils in place, as they are 
already well compacted.  Note that virgin soils are ones that have not been 
disturbed.  Soil which was placed as fill 5 years ago is not virgin soil. A 
layer of well draining fill is required directly below the slab.  This layer 
of fill (6 to 8 inches) must be well compacted.  A reputable contractor will 
test the how well the fill is compacted with any number of instruments, a 
nuclear gauge being fairly common.  This is really essential for any slabs to 
be loaded without cracking.  Finally, appropriate placement of control joints 
or more technically &quot;weakened plane&quot; joints is important.  Control joints are 
used to &quot;control&quot; where the cracks occur so they are not as unsightly.  This 
is but a very brief summary of some concerns and issues.  Also to consider is 
the drainage of the site, weather the space is to be heated, if insulation is 
required, and weather the slab is in the basement (below outside grade).  The 
American Concrete Institute (ACI) publishes a vast amount of information on 
concrete work gained from years of experience.  

Best to use an experienced concrete contractor and to check out his or her 
references yourself.

Good luck.
