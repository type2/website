&lt;&lt; and then you get this reply from the high bidder,


    hi there well I live in southern california it will cost me a grip to 

ship it also and I dont do any body work and the bus will need more then 

half of the metal replaced if you can deliver I can pay you $500 let me 

know thanks take care good luck


This was on my 57 Standard Sunroof bus  I had on there. His bid was 

$500. I obviously haven't had enough alcohol tonight to comprehend this 

email. I clearly stated no shipping, and there were plenty of pics to 

see the bus throughout the auction. Some peoples kids....

    Sorry, I dont normally rant, but its friday and this guy obviously 

isn't playing with a full deck. Nothing against the auction, but this

guy has to go.
