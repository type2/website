Subject: got some leads!!!

Made contact with a VW guy who used to live here in San Angelo, TX but now
lives in Houston. He used to restore 'em for big $$$ customers.

He gave me a very good lead on a 23-window stashed in a garage. He also
told me about a '49 bug in a barn (yes, it really does happen) in a nearby
town. He said that after the war the old farmers would get VW's to drag
behind their tractors when they went to work. When lunchtime came, they'd
drive home in the VW. Interesting.

The hunt is on!!!!!
