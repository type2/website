12 hours?  12 hours?  what are you driving, a tricycle?  even my bus won't
take 12 hours, and i'm accounting for the 4 hours it took me to get home
from sacramento, plus driving to la (la-la land) from here (monterey). you
could drive your porsche, or did the water pump go out again?  we're
leaving friday, going to rich's, going to octo, then maybe the classic and
then coming back sunday afternoon so rachel can go to work in palo alto
monday (at 4 in the morning).  why not fly?  there is nothing with saying
you just don't want to go, either.  alot of people are doing that with the
clasic this year, but still going to octo.

&gt; I'm still hemmin' and hawin'.   I've had a VW or Porsche event almost
every 
&gt; weekend for the past couple months, and have spent a good portion of the 
&gt; time in-between preparing for said events mechanically.   I am burned
out, 
&gt; mentally and physically (think &quot;Attack of the killer Tomato(e)s&quot;
complexion-wise.)   
&gt; I don't know if I have the energy to drive 12 hours, mingle with the
SoCal VW elite
&gt; for few hours, then drive home again.
&gt; 
&gt; I guess I'm going thru a phase of Ellis-esque VW burnout, sans wife and
kid.
