+++++++++Also, October 2000 issue of VW Trends had an
article about a product called 'Your Mama's Bra' made
by PLF (www.plfvw_dot_com)--a custom-made,color-matched
bra that can include a simulated VW emblem and deluxe 
trim if needed.+++++++++++++++++++++

I have a &quot;your Mama's Bra&quot; for my 67 two tone Camper.
When the Bra is on it is hard to tell it's even there,
The color match is great !!
