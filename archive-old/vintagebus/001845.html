&gt; Got home OK, though not in time for the news so I could see what other
&gt; disasters other than a Republican President occurred during my sojourn,
but
&gt; well in time for Jeopardy!  I'll be hard at work tomorrow investigating my
&gt; engine problem.  At the very least, it's a bent push rod.

You did miss another disaster. We had a liberal ex-president who wouldn't
shut the hell up and leave.
