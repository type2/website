&gt; Maybe this is all wrong &amp; I should just be happy driving my 40 year old
truck
&gt; around at 50 mph, but it really can go quicker!

I drive my stock geared, 25.3&quot; diameter tire (stock is 25.8&quot;) big nut tranny
bus 65-67 all day long. With the tires you have, you are far from
overrevving it to do 65mph. If your 205's are 75 series, you have a 27.1&quot;
diameter tire, almost another inch if it's an SR tire.

I think a few months ago Ronnie was going to try some of that &quot;FatMat&quot; stuff
to see how it worked, I don't know if he was able to get around to using it,
I don't remember hearing about it after that.

I'm using fiberglass house insulation in my bus with a couple blankets over
the engine bay and it works pretty good for the money spent. I can have
conversation with the passengers while driving 65mph.
