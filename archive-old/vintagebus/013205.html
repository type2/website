Sounds like a good idea. Ideas on running it, sounds like it would require
some money to get started...perhaps an initiation fee, then an small annual
fee.

$25 to get in, then $5 a year to stay in.
Perhaps the list monitors, and whoever runs the assocition get in for free.

The difficult thing would be deciding when and how to disburse the aid.
