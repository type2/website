&gt; I'm looking to buy a 1600 bus engine.  I live in Oxnard CA.  I could go 
&gt; with
&gt; a long block.  What is the best source in this area or in other areas too.

Hi John,
Try Butch at &quot;Bear's VW Machine&quot; in San Diego 619-691-8385.  For about 
$1,100.00 you can get a SP 1641 with oversized diameter exhaust valve stems, CW 
crank, like we have run for over 50,000 miles and still going strong and smooth!
