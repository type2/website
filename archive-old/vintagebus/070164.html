several people suggested that the tin had been trimmed. I have
compared the front tin w/ my wifes beetle engine several times. Well
this morning I was out of stupid pills &amp; went out to look again. DUH!
I kept looking at the rearmost tin and not the pulley tin when
comparing. Thanks everyone for the encouragement to keep looking
untill my skull actually accepted something :)
