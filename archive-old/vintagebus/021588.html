Subject: Re: [VB] Gas Heaters....&amp; 12V wipers in a 63'?
To: Claralw_at_aol_dot_com, vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

&lt;&lt; JP put a sort of  switch in his bus that means he gets 3 speeds from his 
6V wiper motor in his 12V bus, pretty cool idea. &gt;&gt;

Clara, thanks for the multiple mentions of my three speed wipers, but please, 
come to a show where I have that bus, so I can show you my engineering 
genius!  Not to shows where I'm sleeping in a borrowed singlecab just to stay 
off the (extremely wet) ground!

Anyone, if you want the secret of three speed wipers, just p-mail me.

JP
