&lt;&lt; I understand that now...I had only planned on going away for about 4
 days-and ended up going for a couple weeks. I have never gotten into the
 habit of putting the bus in gear when I park it. I am going to try to do
 that...another reason-the last squareback that I owned had it's front end
 smashed in when the previous owner neglected his emergency brake, and had
 the car roll down the hill.
 
 quick question on greasing the adjusting stars-what do you use for grease-do
 you use a bearing type of grease or a lubricant type stuff(like wd-40)?
  &gt;&gt;
Normally ebrake on fro a few days or a few weeks does not rust.  Do you live 
in a damp climate?  Yes, if you leave the ebrake off leave it in gear 
definately  use blocks if you live on a hill.  

for stars I use regular grease like I grease my suspension with.  Actually it 
might just be the stuff in the pot from catching the suspension grease 
drippings.   WD-40 will evaporate.  Grease will hang out so that next year you can 
still adjust the brakes with a tiny pull on the lever.  Some people like never 
seize.
