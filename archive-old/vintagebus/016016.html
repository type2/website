I agree that it is a major pain in the butt problem! I had a similar 
problem going on...My driver's side door was almost impossible to 
open and my passenger door kept popping open! That one made taking 
Grandma to breakfast on the weekends a real joy!

I finally got it fixed and I'm so much happier now. It's the little 
things that matter in buses!
