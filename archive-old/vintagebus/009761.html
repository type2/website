Subject: Westy Curtains
Date: Thu, 24 Aug 2000 11:38:50 -0500
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

I'm making some curtains for my '66 Westy.
I have slide channels at the top of the windshields and I have found plastic
fittings that fit into these channels and I have found the corresponding
snaps that are sewn into the fabric and snap the curtains onto the plastic
fittings that slide in the channels thus allowing the curtains to open and
close. My bus still has the plastic straps behind the doors that the
curtains are bunched into when they are open.
My question is: when the curtains are pulled together across the inside of
the windshield to the center of the bus; what is used to hold them to the
windshield, or do they just hang straight down inside the bus?
