Hi Volks,

this is just to announce that this new subscriber, ermel_at_gmx_dot_de, is the
same old Erik from Braunschweig, hitherto having sported the addresses
eme_at_bs.hup_dot_de and gerbelmann_at_yahoo_dot_com.  Please do not use them anymore,
but feel free to contact me with anything I might help with, especially
of course VW-ish things that need translation to and fro german, which
I will do for free, or rather, for busma.

Airhowlingly yours,
    Erik &quot;the Panel Van Nazi&quot;, who has four of them and an orphan Kombi
--
Erik Meltzer, Braunschweig, Germany
&quot;...but you still know nothing about me!&quot;  -- Sting
