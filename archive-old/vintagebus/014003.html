Not quite as good as Thom's find, but close....

While waiting for the parts place to open on Saturday, I noticed a
white on green split sitting in a nearby parking lot.  Since I had
nothing better to do at the time, I wandered over to look at it.  Hmm,
there's a for sale sign in the window.  Not really in the market, but
can't hurt to look it over.

There's no noticeable rust underneath.  The engine's very clean, with
one drop of oil having run down and hanging off the right side of the
case (could be from the headds, could be from spillage while
filling).  Body's got a bunch of wobbles in it, but no creases, and no
rust.  The rain gutter's got significant rust, but nothing some
sanding and POR-15 wouldn't cure.  It's a neun-sitzer, with almost-
perfect upholstery.  Being a 1960, there's no gas gauge.  Has
semaphore mounts that's been covered with vinyl tape, and there are
Karmann-Ghia bullets on the front.  Basically, it's almost perfect-
looking, like someone'd restored it ten or fifteen years ago, and then
not done much since then.

Got ahold of the owner and arranged a test drive.  Turns out it sat in
a barn for seventeen years while the original owner's estate got
straightened out, this guy drove it for about a year, then garaged it
for the next ten.  Thus, it's only got thirteen years' worth of wear
and tear - just about everything I saw is original.  Absolutely
amazing shape, particularly considering it was used around a farm.

Drives quite well, except it feels like the left front hub's a bit out
of round.  Came with the 36hp bastard engine originally, has a 40hp in
it now because the current owner managed to blow the 36 up (the
surprising thing being that the original owner didn't manage to do
it).  Still six volt, of course.

The guy asked $5,000.  I'd checked a blue-book-equivalent for it, and
for the shape it's in, they quote $12,000-$20,000.  Thus, I didn't
even consider haggling.  I was the first one to look at it, and I'm
sure that's the only reason I got a chance at it - anyone in their
right minds would have jumped at it.

The only downside is that now I have to sell my 1980 Vanagon and 1966
Microbus to help pay for it.  The Vanagon is, well, a Vanagon.  About
in the shape you'd expect for a twenty-year-old generic camper van
with a new engine.

The '66 is a daily driver project bus.  The rockers are pretty much
gone, the floor around where they were is rusty, holes in the front
wheel wells where water sprays up.  Bungee fourth gear.  Doors need a
bit of persuasion to close, etc, etc.  I've not quite been able to
keep up with its mechanical needs, and the body's been running away in
the meantime.  Has a nice mountain-scape housepaint job, though.  I'd
prefer to sell the body and keep the engine, since it's only a couple
of years old, but that's negotiable.

I'll be following up with pointers to pictures in the near future.
