Subject: RE: Hard/No Starting - Long

I had this problem with my bus, hit me while on a long road trip from bos=
ton
to houston. I had to crawl under the bus everytime i turned it off, and k=
ind
of &quot;short&quot; the solenoid with a long screwdriver. I thought it was a bad
solenoid-as the PO had mentioned the problem, and work-around, but he tho=
ught
the solenoid was the problem.

I have heard pof this problem called a &quot;hot start&quot; problem. It only occur=
s
when the engine is hot, as heat causes resistance(i guess)

After replacing the solenoid-the problem still came back. So I installed =
one
of the those relays-and have not had the problem since. That was about 2 =
years
ago. My bus is a 6 volt.

Many on the list think this problem could be solved by just cleaning yuou=
r
contacts, that a 6V system has no problems etc-but i have gone over almos=
t my
entire electrical system, shinging and polishing any and all contacts-wit=
h out
it helping.

i recommend the relay. -easy install, relatively cheap if i remember
correctly(actually cheaper for 12V than for 6V)

good luck
