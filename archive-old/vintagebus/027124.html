Now that's what I'm say'in.  NQ, look at the signs, first the old lady gets
wacked, to be found the morning before you get a phone call about a bus which
was involved in a murder.  Coinsidence???  Maybe, but what if it isn't?!?!?!?  I
would love to have somebody watching over my bus.  Have you seen the movie the
Sixth Sense or Field of Dreams.  I don't know if I believe in life after death,
but damn....

&gt; sounds like good karma to me, if the man cherished his bus , and then after
&gt; being murdered, managed to take one more ride in the bus , and besides maybe
&gt; when the valves get tight he will tap you on the shoulder and remind you to
&gt; tune.........
&gt; besides all that, have you tried looking up the old newspaper articles on
&gt; the murder, you might find some nice pictures of the bus, or you might find
&gt; that the old antique dealer is pulling your leg, either way you should also
&gt; use the story to leverage down the price a little,
&gt; maybe the ghost rider is keeping the old witch away with those clutch
&gt; problems and waiting for the right guy to come along
