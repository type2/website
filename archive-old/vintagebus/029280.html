Yeah,

So is the F'n SOB in the blue flat bed that almost side swiped me yesterday!
Its a war zone on the LA fwys in a bus.  I spent last week doing 70 miles
round trip to Burbank in my crew cab.  Wow, I was drained from just the
stress of watching out for everyone else!

Drive um' but keep you're eyes peeled!
