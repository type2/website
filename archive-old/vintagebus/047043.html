   I definitely recommend it!!  If fact the only time I think about my
electronic ignition is when I'm telling someone how great they are.  
   I have heard nasty things about the Pentronix ignitions, there apparently
an arm that sticks up, and folks have had trouble with them.  So I went the
Compufire.  It's small, has no arms and the only moving part is a disc that
slips down over the distrubtor shaft, then the stock rotor fits on top of it.
This litte disc just spins with the shaft, it doesn't touch anything.
   Either way you go, these electronic ignitions are they way to go.  Though
I've had my for about 15,000 miles I still keep a spare distrubutor under the
rear seat of the bus.  It's still got points in it just as a back up.
    Peace, Love, and I intend to put on in my thing-we'll see how they handle
water very                                 
       soon,
           Mr. Bubble Head
