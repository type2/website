~Vintage Volkswagen vrs. Geo Metro~

Would the average licensed driver be better of with the modern
econobox over an older Volkswagen?  Maybe yes since with the Geo metro
has no points to replace, no valves to adjust.  Instead of 7 Bolts to
take on and off during an oil change there's only 1 + a filter.  The
Toyota Prius could do 70 all day long up and down hills without a
whimper but the VW would struggle to even make it there, not too good
for the engine and tranny right?  After all that Focus is so much more
comfortable to drive with a quieter interior.  Why not all of us VW
gurus bit the dust and agree that we should toss our VW's aside and go
buy a car that is far more advanced in just about every respect?

Absolutely not, on the contrary.  The average licensed driver is
always better off with the 60's VW because all maintenance can be done
him/herself.  With that ugly looking Toyota Echo the wheel bearings
are sealed, there is no maintenance in that &quot;BUT&quot; what happens if it
does break?  True, a &quot;lot&quot; of parts on the modern econobox can only be
serviced by the dealers you buy them from.  There are no replacing
those bearings on the Echo, it wasn't designed to be removed since
it's expected to go on for 500,000+mi more then the expected life of
the car.

With that in mind simplicity is bliss.  Say the average driver is on a
long trip in the middle of nowhere.  If something goes wrong, that
simple VW can be easily fixed on the spot, that civic cannot.

The problem here is the average licensed driver has never picked up a
wrench before.  The truth is the licensed driver that has no clue what
happens to the gas after every time you fill er up at the gas station
has absolutely no business behind the wheel.  All drivers should know,
should understand the typical automobile through and through so that
in emergency situations he/she would know exactly what to do.

If that were so there would be no more excuses for all the deaths
associated with the automobile.  Everyone should have a good
understanding of mechanics, of vehicle maintenance, of highway safety
and of the laws of physics.  The Automobile is no miracle.  There are
explanations to how a car works, there is absolutely &quot;no&quot; magic
involved.

So yes, absolutely.  By all means, every licensed driver across the
world should know that, Forget about the other car brands out there
(Mitsubishi, Ford, Subaru, Hyundai, Chevy, etc...).  &quot;EVERYONE&quot; 
Everyone should be driving an aircooled Volkswagen.  All the rest of
the cars on the planet that are not, including water cooled
Volkswagens should be torn apart and recycled so more better far more
advanced aircooled Volkswagens can be made reusing the same material. 
More Aircooled VW's being made everywhere today still utilizing that
all too familiar elegant simplicity theme of course.  Yes, the ACVW
could still use some more development beyond Y2K  But advancements
that &quot;maintain&quot; the original simplicity and long lasting durability.

That's the beauty with simplicity.  Why make things more complicated
then they need to be?  A most wonderful place this world would be
indeed if everyone drove ACVW's.

Another reason why a world of only ACVW's would be the best solution
is that the typical all stock ACVW driver is none aggressive.  The
world doesn't need aggressive drivers to terrorize our streets killing
not only themselves but other innocent people.

Think about it - how many old Ladies driving Yacht sized Caddilacs
know how to change the oil?

And so YES, that Ford Factory needs to be converted so it can assemble
ACVW's instead.
