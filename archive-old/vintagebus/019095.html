I think woody put those on his panel, but I think he's off the list right now.
Check the archives _at_ type2_dot_com

&gt; Would love to have some feedback on this subject.  Seems like it never gets 
&gt; any replies.  I've been wanting to do some empi 5s and have checked the 
&gt; archives and all I can gather is Eagle USA made empi's are the best and that 
&gt; they will fit the rear bignut with some shimming or something.  Everyone 
&gt; else I've pmailed w/ empi's on their bus usually have a IRS coversion or 
&gt; something not kickin RGBs.  I found repro BRMs and Sprintstars w 5x205mm for 
&gt; $195 each at http://www.wolfsburgwarehouse_dot_com/  Just my 2 cents...if 
&gt; anybody knows anything I'd like to read it!
