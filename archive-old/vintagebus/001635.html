I agree as well.  There are a few things I will modify (brakes, engine,
electronics), but overall I want my Crew Cab to be as original as possible.
They way I look at it - we are some of the biggest recyclers of them all.  I
bought this truck and it didn't have an engine, so I figured that as long as
I don't have to modify the original sheet metal or framework, I'll put in a
larger engine, so that if some other VW lover comes along and wants to put
it back to completely original, it won't be too much work to do so.  But for
now, I like not getting tailgated.  I like the fact that people come up to
me at gas stations, parking lots, or any place else I have driven Fritz, and
they tell me stories about when they were younger, they used to have a VW
bus and how much fun it was.  Maybe we can all consider ourselves part of
the reason the Passat has become the #1 US import sedan.

66 Crew (Fritz)

&gt;No offense taken Dave.
&gt; On one hand I agree with you totally.  I love all the things that are
&gt;unique to my bus that make it more than &quot;just a car&quot; and something that
&gt;no-one else understands.  I enjoy people going &quot;Oh wow swinging doors&quot;
&gt;and &quot;Look at those cute little tail lights&quot;.
&gt;But on the other hand I enjoy a few of the &quot;mod-cons&quot;.  I no longer have
&gt;the original radio (it wasnt in there when I got it anyway), I replaced
&gt;it with a kick ass Blaupunkt system (at least I kept it German), I have
&gt;an alarm and immobiliser with dual stage shock sensors and microwave
&gt;movement detectors (I could have used the door pin switches instead if
&gt;there were some - another special v.w. feature) to keep what's mine as
&gt;mine, the interior has been reupholstered in crushed velour.
&gt;There is no way that I could do anything like alter the ride height, or
&gt;drop in a bigger engine or anything like that.
&gt;I do enjoy my bus for all it's peculiarities, but I do enjoy some
&gt;luxuries aswell
&gt;
