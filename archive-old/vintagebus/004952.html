I'll chime in on this from the &quot;lowered&quot; perspective.  When we lowered my
bus with the Wolfgang kit and switched to a 68 type 1 trans, I also setup a
doghouse shroud with new cooler and thicker fan to replace the non-doghouse
shroud running a remote cooler.  The motor is 1600 sp with kadrons, 009,
compufire, and single qp.  On both drives to Kelley Park and Sac Bugorama,
my Berg temp dipstick would turn the light on if I sustained speeds of 65mph
or faster.  If I slowed down to 55 and stayed there, the light would go out
and stay out.  But driving 55 seems to defeat the purpose of going the type1
route for lower Rs on the highway.  It has also crossed my mind that perhaps
the Rs are too low thereby not turning the fan fast enough at given freeway
speeds but then why would slowing down cool it down.  I've backed the timing
off some with no difference but want to fiddle with it some more as well as
check the air/fuel mix.  I'm interested to find out if it's the phat motor
that makes the difference too.
