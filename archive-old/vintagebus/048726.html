Subject: &quot;F&quot;'d up setting my end play

Putting back together my 1600cc engine.

Well, I think I blew it on my end play setting. I'm not sure where or 
what. Here's what happened. I checked the endplay using the original 
3 shims that were in there. It seemed to be in the .009-.011 range 
rather than the .003-.005 it was supposed to be. So I grabbed some 
extra shims I have and found a thicker one. I substituted it for the 
thinnest of the 3 originals. I tried to check it again and it seemed 
more tight, but I was a tad sloppy checking &amp; then just went for it 
using those 3 shims. I then installed my seal, flywheel, and then 
torgued the gland nut.

  Now, when I got it done, there is NO end play. The flywheel doesn't 
move at all. So I guess I blew it. I went ahead and wrested the gland 
nut back off AGAIN (with the help of my wife) and removed the 
flywheel.

So is there something I'm missing here? or did I just do a crappy job 
measuring the end play the first time around?

Any help, tips appreciated.
