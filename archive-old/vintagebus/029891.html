&gt; &gt; Guys, from what OG two tone buses I've seen the factory norm was from
&gt; &gt; Barndoors through 58 the bottom color was sprayed on the entire bus then
&gt; &gt; the top color was applied to the edge of the bottom line of the
&gt; &gt; beltline. 59 and on the top color whether it be grey-biege, cumulus
&gt; &gt; white or whatever was painted over the entire bus and the bottom color
&gt; &gt; was then applied in the same fashion from the bottom of the beltline down.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Evidence can be seen when the OG paint fades and shows the base color
&gt; &gt; through i.e. the 20K SWR G-B 23 window at OCTO in June, you could see
&gt; &gt; spots of grey-beige coming through the sealing wax red. Then look at a
&gt; &gt; number of faded deluxes and standards and such from the 50's and you'll
&gt; &gt; always see the bottom color coming through the top color.
&gt; &gt;
&gt;
&gt; I know we've discussed this before and seem to recall that there were
&gt; examples that questioned this. Is it possible that the color that was
&gt; sprayed first on the entire bus was the interior color and that the top or
&gt; bottom 2nd color was done after?

On my turkis 62 standard, the bottom color was painted first inside and out.
The white was then sprayed on second on the top (to the bottom of the belt line)
and inside on the dash, floor, etc.  The rear portion of the bus inside seems to
have just gotten over spray...and that was good enough.  In places where the
headliner has come off down by the windows, it just looks like overspray and
glue underneath ...and doesn't look too hot.
To the best of my knowledge, the only portion of my bus that has been repainted
is the roof...and the previous owner (that owned the bus for 23 years before me)
told me this.
