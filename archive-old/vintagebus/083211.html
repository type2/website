Subject: Re: [VB] Shift rod bushing

Been told that muriatic acid is basically just hydrochloric acid watered
down for pool use.

Try Kroil from Kano Labs. Go to www.kanolabs_dot_com. You can order a can for
8.95 plus shipping. I have had a 10 oz. can for years. You only need a
little and it seems to work pretty well when ever I had a problem. Spray it
on, wait a while(10-15 minutes), spray a little more, bang on the bolt/nut,
try to tighten before loosen, it has always worked for me.

Anyone else used it?

Chris



&gt; Just a thought and something that should be on the last-thing-to-try
&gt; list before breaking out the hacksaw... Muriatic acid, used by pool
&gt; people, will attack rust and remove it pretty quickly. It's messy, toxic
&gt; and should be well respected with the use of nitrile gloves, eye
&gt; protection and a ready source of water to neutralize it. I've used it to
&gt; remove rust from bumpers, so it might free up a very rusty mechanical
&gt; connection.
