Joel,
I agree this must be correct. I wish I had an exhuast gas tester to
check mixture. I do believe a g55 would assist the setting of the 30/31
Brosol on a stock 1500/1600 SP, though, and am going to try it out.
Al

Buslist-
Do I have this right? (Al's question is at the bottom.)

Al-
I don't know when exactly the main sprayer (and hence the main jet)
really starts going. What sprays when is determined by the vacuum
present in the carb at any given time. When the throttle is closed or
almost closed, vacuum is low and just a little gas is sucked out through
those small holes near the throttle plate, via the pilot jet (and the
mains, but flow here isn't enough for the main jet to have much
restrictive effect). As the throttle is opened more, vacuum increases,
and more gas is sucked through these progressively higher holes, until
sufficient vacuum exists (throttle largely open) to begin sucking gas
through that main sprayer arm, dead centre of the carb barrel. This gas
doesn't flow via the pilot jet or auxillary jet like the stuff which
comes out the holes near the throttle plate, it comes straight through
the main jet. So the mains doesn't really come into play until your
engine picks up speed. And when the throttle is wide wide open and the
motor is winding up like she's going to explode the air correction jet
starts letting in a little extra stream of air bubbles into the gas flow
to lean out the mixture some. If your bus is stalling at idle I would
guess either your mixture screw is out too far or your pilot jet is too
big. Emphasis on guess. But it is a bit harsh judging a bus by how it
behaves cold... Joel

Joel,
Put the bus away for winter, but latest adjustments have made for a 900
rpm idle that stall easy at stops, especially when just running 10
minutes or so. Still not hot enough oil I think, real shitty heat. I
imagine I am too rich still at the pilot and aux levels? When can the
main be taken into consideration? At a particular load/rpm, or throttle
level? I am confused on this point. Seems like I am still after a
meaner/leaner idle... Al
