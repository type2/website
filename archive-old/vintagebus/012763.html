Bob, Sorry to hear about that. Ive placed a few orders
thru Bus Depot, they had the correct stuff in my hand
very quick, in all orders I had the part before they
even debited my bank account:) Also Emailed em several
times with a very quick (within 24 hours) response to
the question.
It might be that they have a new employee, or as Ive
ran across at work speaking with people all over the
country, sometimes its hard to communicate to each
other exactly what you want:) (and northern folk think
&quot;I&quot; have an accent:)
If ya couldnt explain to him, Id asked for another
employee, with mabey more experience.
just my $0.02 worth...
I doubt the world is out to get ya... Its to busy
trying to catch up with me:o
Later,
