Ya know, I don't remember if my FI 75 bug was rebuilt before I rebuilt it of
not, but it had long reach plugs on it. I know, because when I bout new plugs
I bought what I always bout, 1/2&quot; and ended up messing up the threads and
running them that, not to mention had bad it ran. I thought my daughter was
crazy complaining on how bad it ran on the highway. I found out why when I
took the heads off. Heck, the flame wall on ignition must have been one messed
up burn!

Hmmm, did the '75-up dual port heads use 3/4&quot; reach plugs?  If not, they
must have been thickened a second time!
