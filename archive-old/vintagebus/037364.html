I know that it's friday somewhere in the world so I would like to propose a 
Have and Have Not day for the list, kind of a house cleaning and elusive part 
search. Maybe for every item needed list an item you have to spare? After 
all, one persons junk is anothers treasure. Maybe this isn't appropriate list 
material, but I thought it would be nice for us to pool resources in this way.

Thanks,
