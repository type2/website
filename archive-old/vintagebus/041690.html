&gt; When I attempted to look at the new VW's at the local dealer I was

You should have gone to see the sales drone's manager.  After the manager
is informed of his salesman's lousy attitude it might do some good.

there's a Rolls-Royce dealership in Beverly Hills where the owner
occasionally hires someone to come in wearing shabby dress.  His salesmen
are instructed to treat everyone that walks in with the deference due a
Rolls customer.  If the &quot;test customer&quot; doesn't  get treated right the
salesman is canned.  Reason?  Many of the richest people don't look rich!

VWs don't cost all that much less than RR, these days! :)
