Hi Volks,
Section E-6 page 8 of the 1959 bus workshop manual has all the measurements 
for the tail lights.  Matter of fact there is one of these manuals for sale 
on Wolfsburgwarehouse website for $130.00 which is a bargan.   Eric&amp;Barb
PS Someone on this list had Pmailed us about needing some sections for thier 
1959 bus shop manual.  We have since found some of these sections and now can 
not remember who needed them!  So contact us again please.  EEE&amp;B
