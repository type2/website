You might want to tell your friend with the bus not to mention that a
murder was involved. It would definitely scare away a lot of potential
buyers. I would have a hard time buying a car (or a house for that matter)
if I knew some kind of foul play was involved. Just too freaky. 
Sorry to hear about your neighbor. Both my next door neighbor and my
neighbor across the street died within three days of each other last month.
Guess I'd better move to be safe.
Later,
Cindy

&gt; 
&gt; Lillian Meisenbach was a healthy 83 year old woman - alert, sharp as a
tack,
&gt; and a very wealthy woman from playing her cards right through life.  She
&gt; lived 2 and 1/2 blocks from me and would often give me glaring looks as I
&gt; sped by on my chainsaw sounding moped or bug on my way to work in the
&gt; mornings.  She would often be outside doing old people things like old
&gt; people like to do that early in the morning like sweeping the sidewalk or
&gt; watering her lawn.  She never returned my smiles and waves but that's
okay.
&gt; Lillian had been missing since February 6th and yesterday morning, a
farmer
&gt; 13 miles north of here was walking his dog down a dirt road and when he
&gt; crossed the bridge, there she lay face down in the creek bed - fodder for
&gt; the coyotes.  The blood stains found on the red interior of her rental
car
&gt; pointed to foul play from the start.  Beatrice Nebraska's first murder in
&gt; over 12 years.
&gt; 
&gt; This evening, I got a call from Judith Noah who works for the Sherrif's
&gt; Dept. in Falls City, NE.  She's got a worn and slightly rusty 1967 bus
for
&gt; sale that in all respects is in good shape for it's Midwestern age.  We
&gt; talked at length about her bus - she knows what she has and I so do I. 
It's
&gt; a bus that can be a runner with very little work.  She parked it because
she
&gt; couldn't find the gears and 40 miles after having the clutch replaced, it
&gt; started having the trouble again so it's been parked outside for over 3
&gt; years now.  The tires are sunk in the ground, engine bay is really clean,
&gt; and it appears that very little work would be needed to make it a runner.
&gt; It's painted white over red (my favourite color setup too!)  So now I'm
torn
&gt; between getting my old white POS 66 going (I'm so close), or attempting
to
&gt; get this bus (with it's better body) and getting it going.  I know the
&gt; rust-free nature of this bus is going to save me a lot of money in the
&gt; future and if you could only see the undercarriage of my 66, you'd
probably
&gt; say to go with the 67.  But why is this bus in such good shape?  Judith
told
&gt; me the following story:
&gt; 
&gt; &quot;My dad worked on Volkswagens for years but he eventually lost interest.
&gt; Dad had heard of some real nice VWs coming up on an estate sale in
Missouri
&gt; so he went to the sale and bought the bus which was in really good shape.
&gt; The previous owner cherished his VWs and really kept them up well.
&gt; Unfortunately, he was murdered and his body was hauled away in this bus
and
&gt; dumped.  The bus was used in a murder but I've camped in it and there is
&gt; nothing weird like ghosties or anything like that.&quot;
&gt; 
&gt; Now I'm not superstitious and I have strong religeous views on the
&gt; supernatural so it shouldn't really bother me but riding in a hearse is
bad
&gt; enough - more or less a bus that is known to have been involved in a
murder.
&gt; And with Lillian gone - man - what karma and vibes I had felt were just
&gt; about destroyed.  Despite all of this, I'm still running over to Falls
City
&gt; to inspect the cargo floor and meet Judith in person.  If the deal
doesn't
&gt; go thru, I'll post her info because the bus is available - just make an
&gt; offer she says (the antique dealer in her - which she is.)
&gt; 
&gt; I'd appreciate hearing any comments/opinions on this - what a werid crazy
&gt; situation...
