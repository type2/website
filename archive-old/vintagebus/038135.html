As far as &quot;garbage&quot;
Theres four things i will NOT drive without in a VW without.
1) Brakes
2) Insurance
3) Registration
4) Drivers License

I think you need to use commen sence when taking a 45 year old vehicle on a 
big trip.
I think brian A.K.A. &quot;Beanie&quot; showed no commen sence and just lucked out.

Im glad I wasnt following him on the way home!~
