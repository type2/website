 I went ahead and took it all the way off so I could clean the threads 
 and the nut up to hopefully make it work a little better
 
 Good ol Muir says that the wing nut was a big improvement over just 
 having a regular nut on there. I think for my bus I disagree! with 
 the heater box, some part of the doghouse tin, and the tranny, there 
 is NO room for my hand to get up there and actually get a hold of the 
 wing nut. I can touch it. But I can't get to it like the nut is 
 disigned to be used. For me, a simple socket would be MUCH better. I 
 can get a socket wrench up in there no sweat. I may not be able to 
 turn it but a few clicks at a time. But at least I can turn it. My 
 opinion.
 
 Any reason why I shouldn't switch it over to a regular nut with 
 another nut to lock it in place?

I use a very small adjustable wrench for stuck ones, with a vise grip on the 
solid (not cable) part of the cable.  I have bent some wingnut ears doing 
this.   when the threads are clean, and greased, you can do it by hand.  I 
use this technique:  Put on hat, scoot under bus from motor end, facing up,  
head to front of bus.   about as far so just my feet stick oout from under 
the bus.   reach my LEFT hand OVER the axle tube.  Then I can reach the 
wingnut without contorting.

I just adjusted the clutch on my 61 deluxe, after installing the motor.  The 
wingnut turned easily, I had cleaned it up and greased it about 5 years ago.  
   so they don't stick it slathered with grease.   I think it is easier to 
slide under and turn a wingnut than mess with two wrenches (two arms in 
there?) and realising you have the wrong size and climbing out from under the 
bus and getting another wrench...
 Definately easier to unstick it with the motor out!!

Some of the clutch arms where the cable goes through have a kinda pointy both 
ends oval twards the wingnut side of the hole the cable goes through.  This 
is cause the wingnut has a similar shape the side that goes towards the arm.  
so the wingnut does not loosen itself  I think the nuts are round, and they 
should be used with an arm with a round shape there, but i dunno how much it 
matters.
