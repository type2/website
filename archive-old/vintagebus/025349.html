&gt; And you expect to have room for luggage AND people as well?  You'd be lucky
&gt; to fit all that stuff in a bus with you passengers, and if driving a pickup,
&gt; I guess be prepared to fill the entire cargo area up with parts!  

I carry nearly all this, plus a hatchet. I carried as much 8000 miles
and still had space to live.

&gt;Why not
&gt; just carry a cell phone instead of the 50 items on the list?  

Who would I call? My mechanic drives my bus.

&gt;  I know on my 73 bug, I check out
&gt; essential items before I drive it each time and make sure I go over the
&gt; entire vehicle about every 8 weeks.  Seems to work for me.  I plan to take
&gt; the same approach with Fritz once he's alive again.

Thats great if you are staying within a couple hundred miles from home,
but I like to be able to get up and go. Eric and Barb travel more in
their bus than any three other people I know put together. They know a
little about keeping a bus on the road and moving.
