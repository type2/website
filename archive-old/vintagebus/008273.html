&gt;'''' I also need the aluminum strip which fits on the edge of the vinyl
&gt; flooring, along the sliding door opening.&quot;&quot;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Is this the same on 67-64 split so-42's???  Mine for my 65 is all chewed
up...I've never seen one for sale at any swap.

I measured the trim strip on my 77 Westy....it is 45'' long.
I measured the door opening on my 66 Deluxe... it is 46''.
Even though the bay strip is an inch short, wouldn't you have to cut it in
the middle because of the lower cargo door latch pins?
The latch plate welded to the floor is 4 1/4'' long....  46 - 4 1/4 = 41
3/4''.... Wouldn't a bay one work?
