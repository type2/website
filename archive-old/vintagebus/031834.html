If you ever buy GEX&lt; SIR or any of the cheapo rebuilders you will find that
most of them (heads) have been welded, a common low budge fix. If I go
through my pile of a couple hundred heads I find that most of the duel ports
are either welded or cracked, very rarely do I find a cracked single port.

Subject: [VB] Cracked heads?


Someone was advertising a set of heads on my site with text similar to this:

&gt;VW Heads, used, clean, small cracks between valves on each, ...
&gt;

Doesn't that mean they are junk?  Just curious because I've thrown out heads
that had those small cracks.

Thanks,
Everett
