Subject: Re: [VB] adjusting box65 engine/steeringbox report (long)

well, the ideal is to set it where it has no play and no drag.   This ideal had completely unworn parts in the steering box, and of course no slop anywhere else in the steering, and may not be acheived by your bus.  If there is a choice between drag and play, I choose play.  

To adjust my box I jacked the front up so the wheels were off the ground.  Tools needed were a big screwdriver and a 19mm wrnch.   under the bus the steering box (under the steering column) has a big slotted screw surrounded by a 19mm nut.  while holding teh screw, undo the nut.   back the screw up, then screw it in till it reaches contact.    wiggles the steering wheel, turn from all the way one way to the other (about 3 3/4 turns? ). 

This idea is for there no to be drag when you turn the wheel, but that adjustment screw to take out all the slack. Basically if you feel drag, back the screw off a 1/6 of a hair.  Try again.   It helps if you have someone to sit and turn the wheel who can tell what drag feels like, then you can just turn the screw.
 When you are satisfied, hold the screw from turning with teh screwdriver and snug down the 19mm lock nut (like adjusting valves). test for drag again. Take for test drive.  
 I snugged up a bit on my bus, feels better, think it'll do w/ a bit snugger.

 If you have drag, it's too tight and this will wear things. when you adjust it correctly there wil be no drag, but will be slop in some places.  You can decide how bad you can deal with it before you replace it.  If the steering box is thunking, time to start thinking about replacing it.  That said, I have known for years my steeringbox was the weak point in my steering, but have a mental block about them, and put it off for about 5 years. over which time it slowly got worse.   It really didn't get too bad until recently.

 Oh, and when you are adjusting the drag link length, make sure the wheel is still pointed straight before you do the final attachment of the drag link end to the pitman arm.  Other wise it may not be straight.  oops.

&gt; How much drag at the center point do you set your steering box to? I
&gt; adjusted mine and there is isn't any play in the steering but it seems sort
&gt; of tight at the center point. Also on mine there is a noticible clunk when I
&gt; rock the steering wheel back and forth. Plenty oil in the 
&gt; box, and very
&gt; little or no play in the steering.
