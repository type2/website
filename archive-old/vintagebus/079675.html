Subject: Re: [VB] VOLKSWAGEN BLUES, A KIND OF LONG LAMENT....

 I doubt that a bra would take anymore than a few hours to make , if even that. One of Toms tilts on the other hand is a more labor intensive project. 
 I'd ask for a refund as it sounds like a bad transaction. In fairness I've bought a few items from the vendor you elude too and never had a problem. 
 
Tom, I was at the airport in SLC on Monday. I had NO idea the lake was that big!
