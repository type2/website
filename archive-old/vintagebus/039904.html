&gt;I've gotten pretty good at identifying busses by what they look like from
&gt;the outside, but need help at figuring out what motor is in the bus I 
&gt;bought
&gt;a few weeks ago.  Anyone know of a link(s) I could try until I can get some
&gt;pictures posted?  This I do know, It's in a 65, looks alot like the 1600 in
&gt;my 71, but has dual Kadron's and a fram oil filter.
&gt;\

Oh no! You have one of those! You should send it to me immediately. You dont 
have any idea about what damage that engine can cause!

Seriously, they put a 1600 or higher engine in there, added the dual carbs, 
and put on an oil filter. A rebiuld probably, look at the case numbers. or 
better still, take it apart and see what is what. Thats about the best info 
you are going to get.
