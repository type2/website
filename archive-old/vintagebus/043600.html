&gt;I am still trying to get a BN-4 going.   

Can you make it to Kansas City in a couple of weeks?  No?  :)

&gt;I figured how to hook it up with the brown to ground and big red wire 
&gt;w/inline fuse to hot.  Hooked up a headlight switch as a switch from hot to 
&gt;the A prong on the relay.  Then when I turn the switch the fan blows.

This is the wiring diagram, right?

&gt;What confuses me is the wiring.  Right, so some stuff I hoave from
&gt;something Ron Van Ness wrote about understanding these things says
&gt;there are 3 wires to the fuel pump.  Mine has 2 wires.  This may be
&gt;a year thing.  The wiring diagram shows one wire a ground, and the
&gt;other comes from the temp regulator which gets power from turning
&gt;the heater on.  okay,  so both the wires at the pump are brown.
&gt;One is screwed to this bit that grounds. 

According to the diagram above, there are two fuel things: the pump
and a fuel cutoff solenoid (sort of like the idle solenoid on
later model carburetors).  Early models have a brown hot wire to
the pump and a green hot wire to the solenoid that both come from
the same place.  Both pieces ground through their mounting.  The
later models have a green hot wire to the pump, a green hot wire
to the solenoid, and a brown ground wire for the pump.

Also, it looks like the fuel pump has the ability to turn itself off,
or something.  See the contact inside the pump on the wiring diagram.
Maybe this implements an &quot;x minutes on, x minutes off&quot; thing - on
the BA 6 wiring diagram at Thom's site, the fuel pump is actually
run by a cam off the combustion air blower, so it probably wouldn't
run all the time either.

I think it's likely that if you disconnect the wire at the pump that
doesn't go straight to ground, and power it, then the pump should run
if it's working.

&gt;any hints /suggestions?

I started to write an explanation based on the above wiring diagram
but after I did I found another manual online at
http://www.conservatory_dot_com/vw/manuals_nyx/EberBN4.html .  There is
installation, operation, and troubleshooting info which includes a
bench test procedure (heater not installed in the car).  Wow, it 
even has wiring diagrams marked up for each phase of operation.
Even labor times in case you're fixing one for warranty.  :)
Go look at it - it's really good.

Good luck!
