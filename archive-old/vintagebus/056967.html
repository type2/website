Subject: Visibility

Chris,
  Bet you have a bench seat! I'm 6'2&quot; also. Walkthroughs 
are better for tall drivers. I had to put in a 914 seat 
to prevent back and shoulder hunching, not to mention 
traffic collisions.  I still haven't put in the sun 
visors because they're never needed.  

   -Harry

&gt; I've started driving my '65 every day and wondering:  anybody else have 
&gt; trouble seeing through the front window?  I'm 6'2&quot; and my eye level is 
&gt; even with the top of the window unless i bend myself into a question 
&gt; mark.  Hard to see the signal change....
&gt; 
&gt; Chris
&gt; '65
