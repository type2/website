Subject: Re: [VB] Rear main seal replacement??

Rich,
Ours (oil cooler) did leak at high oil pressure start up and then stopped
when the pressure drops.
Now the tranny out put shaft seal leaked after warm up but the leak looked
maybe lower. Bottom line -- replace both when the motor is out!
Philip tried a good technique to remove the trans seal -- We drilled two
small holes around the seal careful not to hit the shaft or trans housing
then thread in two sheet metal screws. Then pry or pull out,  we used a seal

remover tool ( almost similar to the claws on a claw hammer) to pry with.
P &amp; C

&gt;  The oil was leaking from up high (out of sight
&gt; while lying on the floor) and running down on that side.
&gt;
&gt; To the questions:
&gt; 1) Is this indicative of a rear main seal failure?
&gt; 2) Is this something that could have been damaged/dislodged during
&gt; removal or reinstall of the motor?
&gt; 3) Is this (the seal) something that can develop a leak when unused for
&gt; a period of time?
&gt; 4) If I need to replace this thing, is it a big deal?

&gt; Greetings listees,
&gt;
&gt; I have several questions, but will start with some background info. I
&gt; recently got my bus back from the body shop (4 month visit) and am
&gt; having some severe oil leakage issues. Before I turned the bus over, it
&gt; was not leaking more than a few drops a day. On the contrary, it was
&gt; burning quite a bit, but that's not relevant to this situation and was
&gt; (supposedly) fixed while the motor was out. Anyway...
&gt;
&gt; As of this evening, it was leaking from the valve cover on one side and
&gt; what appeared to be &quot;all over the bottom&quot;. Further research revealed
&gt; that one of the valve cover bales was a little weak. I bent it around a
&gt; bit and cured that problem. After wiping down the motor with a rag and
&gt; changing what was left of the oil, I fired it up and sat back to watch.
&gt; Not much activity until the motor warmed up a bit. At that point, it
&gt; started to leak aggressively on the drivers side of the case where the
&gt; trans connects to it. The oil was leaking from up high (out of sight
&gt; while lying on the floor) and running down on that side.

&gt; a period of time?

&gt;
&gt; Now to the venting! To say that I am a pretty upset that the motor was
&gt; not tested after install is an understatement. This type of leak would
&gt; be very unmistakable, since I managed to pump out 2-1/2 quarts of oil in
&gt; the first 10 miles that I drove. Luckily for me, a gas station was my
&gt; first stop and I noticed the Valdez trail behind me. I was able to put
&gt; it on a trailer, but shudder to think what would have happened othewise.
&gt;
&gt; Your valuable input is appreciated, as always.
