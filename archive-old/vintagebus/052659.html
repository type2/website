Subject: Re: [VB] speaking of tires

&gt; Does anyone know when redline tires were available?

You could order them as a factory option on your Vette through the early
70's. You can order them from
http://www.ecklers_dot_com/product.asp?dept%5Fid=261&amp;pf%5Fid=29373 . They are a
repro Firestone tire and the size is too huge for a stock bus. Don't know if
their vendor makes them smaller or not. There was a guy that gave me a flyer
at Barfing By the Bridge a year or so ago. He will red or gold line any
tire. Might be where Eckler's gets theirs. Can't find the flyer, maybe
Ronnie had some idea who he was.
