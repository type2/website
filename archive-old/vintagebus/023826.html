Subject: Correct valve adjustment
References: &lt;199807191802.LAA30643_at_yiff.azaccess_dot_com&gt;

If you have been following my reports, I have my bus up and running and
I am in the process of changing the tranny fluid and the redux box
fluid.  I rebuilt the carb, adjusted the timing and replaced the cap and
rotor.  I have seem to have hit a wall though.  I can not for the life
of me figure out the correct adjustment for the valves on the bus.  It
is a 1966 deluxe with an engine number  0748317.  I can not find the
magic letter &quot;H&quot; the would tell me to adjust at .004.  From the looks of
Chiltons and Bentley, the settings after 1965 were at .004.  I would
hate to set them wrong and pay the price for my mistake. Any type of
insight would help.
