Subject: Re: [VB] Re: Heater Tube and Gas heaters

----- Original Message ----- 
&gt; If heat is your primary concern and you need to replace the tube I have a
&gt; BA-6 Gas heater for sale that mounts inline with your heating tube. These
&gt; things are the holy grail when it comes to heating a bus. First off they
&gt; produce approximately twice the BTU's as a BN-4 and since they are inline
&gt; they also defrost your windows, unlike a regular bus style. additionally
&gt; they have extra safety features that didn't come on the earlier ones.

The big downfall to the BA-6 heaters is that the airflow is still dependant
of the engine. So at idle or low rpm driving, you still don't have a lot of
heat output. Thier max output is a bit over 20K BTU's, but unfortunatly you
aren't driving at 4000 rpm all the time to keep that airflow up. I don't
think they're bad though, they do defrost the winshield pretty quick (takes
about 90 seconds to heat up), and if you're driving down a canyon or
similar, the heater still blows hot air.

I have one of these installed in my 79 Westy, and on a 40 degree morning
like we've had for the last week or so, I still have a bit of a chill while
driving unless I wear my coat. Compared to the 20K BTU Southwind I had
installed in my 64 bus with the duct blowing out under the rear seat, the
performance is night and day. My old Southwind kept me warm enough to drive
around in a T-shirt on the 10 degree mornings we had last year (I had
insulated behind all the panels as well). I think the big difference is, the
SW blows 20K BTU's full time when on high, where as the BA-6 still depends
on engine rpm for the amount of heat delivery.

But would I get rid of my BA-6? No way, it is definitly a &quot;boost&quot; to the
stock heating system, that's for sure.

That's just my point of view with two different gas heaters.
