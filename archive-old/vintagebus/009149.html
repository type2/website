Subject: Re: [VB] how to remove a inside handle fron door 1960 ??

&gt; I got my two front door out of my 1960 bus so i can renovate (renovation
?)
the doors..., now i want to remove the Inside Handle so  all the door panel
go off!!  How do i remove it... i lift the handle and saw a little hole in
the axis.. but its not a screw !??!
&gt;
There's usually a little pin on the inside of the handle where it goes over
the door mechanism.  It's in that hole you see.  The pin only comes out/goes
in one way because it's bigger on one end than the other.  I've used a
little finishing nail to pop it out in the past.

Don't lose the pin, I hate when I do that.

Good luck,
Everett Barnes
