Tom,

A few years ago I had a similar problem with my '59 single cab.  If I 
wiggled the wires to the switch under the dash, it would start right up.

The power from your battery goes to the headlight switch first and from 
the headlight switch to your ignition switch.  The early buses have 
screw terminals on the switches instead of push on terminals.

The problem I had was the wire to the headlight switch was a little 
loose.  try pulling your headlight switch, cleaning the wire ends and 
putting the wires back in the switch, making sure the screw terminals 
are nice and tight.  See if that cures your problem.

Dave
