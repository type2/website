 I would say no they are not as valuable as an early SC- It seems to me that
 SC's are on the bottom of the food chain of the commercial buses cuz there

It seems to me that SCs are pretty desirable.  When I drove one (ratty), 
people kept asking to buy it, even before I got it home.  Much, much more than any 
other VW I've had.
