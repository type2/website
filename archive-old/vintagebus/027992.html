Subject: Roof rack brackets?

Hello oh list,

I recently acquired a full length roof rack for my 65, I won't mention
the killer deal I got so as not to offend, but I was unable to obtain
the required brackets.  I have no idea what they even look like. If
anyone has some they would like to part with, or even a picture of one
so I know what to look for I would be most grateful.
BTW is there a difference in the racks from year to year?  This one
seems to fit okay, a couple of the legs ride up out of the rain gutter,
but I assume that corrects itself when you clamp it down.
Thanks,
Jon 65 sundial
