&gt; My brake lights don't work. where do I start?

Hi John,
Try a search in the archives for &quot;brake lights&quot; or &lt;A HREF=&quot;http://www.type2_dot_com/archive/vintagebus/011116.html&quot;&gt;
http://www.type2_dot_com/archive/vintagebus/011116.html&lt;/A&gt;

 &gt; Also, my turn signals blink very fast. Everynow and then it will blink at 
&gt; the proper speed, but not very often. wonder what is wrong there?  

Could be you have a bad positive connection and/or no grounding wires running 
from each rear taillight to where the battery ground strap bolts to the body. 
 

&gt; I want to be able to hook my radio up so it will come on when the switch 
&gt; comes on, and also when i camp i'd like another way to flip it on. I was 
&gt; wondering if i just ran a hot wire up and put a switch on it, so i could 
&gt; use it when i want, will the wire that goes back to the ignition coil be 
&gt; hot when i flip the switch? I know that sounds confusing, but i did find a 
&gt; wire on my 67 that turns hot when the key is on. so i used it for my 
&gt; accesory. but if i put another hot wire up from the battey and put a switch 
&gt; inline, when this wire is hot, it will also be sending current to the 
&gt; accesory wire which defeats the purpose correct?

Correct unless you find a special built switch for changing from one power 
source to another.  If you are big into camping you might want to look into a 
battery isolation relay to have a second battery for use when parked/camping 
that automaticly charges when running the engine, but does not allow the 
starting battery to run down at all!  Or do what we do and keep the radio 
turned up enough to always hear it, and if you need to turn it down just turn 
it OFF.  Eric&amp;Barb
