Importance: Normal

Picked up A 1/24 scale Chinese made die cast of a splittie, has bullet turn
lights but a sliding side door.  Has a somba style sun roof in back and a
sunroof in front too.  Came in two tone with white top and red, orange or
green metal flake bottom.  Made by sunnyside ltd. Rear door opens up too.
All in all a nice desk top paper weight.

Thanks,

Kevin Sullivan
