&gt; -What exactly is this part?

Hi Cris,
Got images?  Sounds like an after VW factory add on to us.

 Could it be an additional part for Westfalias? Susan's 66 &gt; 
&gt; Dormobile has something very similar, but not quite the same shape (hers has 
&gt; two 
&gt; cylinders next to the voltage regulator).

Those could be condensors to rid the static noise from the radio.

&gt; -Which wire goes where? The wiring diagrams don't show this additional 
&gt; piece that I am aware of, so I am lost...

Have you tried looking through Thom's wiring diagram on vintagebus_dot_com?
