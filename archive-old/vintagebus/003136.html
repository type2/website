My OCTO trip went pretty well. Only rained when we needed it, such as for
putting out fires, filling the radiator, etc. The Westfailure is sporting a
new flame job down the side but otherwise is recovering nicely from a mildly
problematic trip out. The trip home was longer than usual. The replacement
fuel pump only pumps 8 gallons an hour and the Westfailure was getting 10
mpg, so we had to drive somewhat below our normal cruising altitude. Do the
math. Good to see everyone, and nice to see that bus parts have increased in
value so much. If they keep going I should be able to pay for the kids
college with a few grungy old vacuum advance distributors I've been hanging
on to.
