DeLux's had a rubber strip around the whole beltline.That would be my first
educated guess.

List- Please help me to answer this question (its bring driving me crazy for

several years now): you know panels,kombis, standards,and probably others 
were equipped with rubber bumpers mounted to the side of the vehicle that 
served to protect the body from damage when one of the vehicle doors was 
opened AND were also equipped with check straps on the side cargo doors. On 
the other hand, DeLuxe buses were equipped with the check strap ONLY to 
obviously protect the side of the vehicle (in this case the aluminum 
beltline molding) from damage. Now my question- why were the non-DeLuxe 
buses equipped with BOTH rubber bumpers AND check straps???
