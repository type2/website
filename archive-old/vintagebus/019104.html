well i have looked at this a few times...there are a couple of options. 

a)CLEAN IT IN PHOTOSHOP

I have tried to clean it up in photoshop...this could take a long time, and
not really give you a real clean finished product, that wouldbe worth
reproducing. Especially since it si mostly line work(vectors).

b)REDRAW IT
this may actually be easier and cleaner at the end. I can redraw it,
unfortunately when drawing the speedo, it appears that each arc has a
different center. 
Is this correct, 

it seems I could draw it as close to the original scan as possible, but the
arcs may actually not be located correctly, and therefore might be just a
useless pretty picture. Or I could try to estimate where I think the arcs
should go and possible get a more accurate object at the end.

How flat was the object when you scanned it?

any suggestions...or comments
