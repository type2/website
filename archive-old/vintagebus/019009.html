I'm wanting to cut an emergency brake cable. What tool
can I use to do 
this?

-----------
Double check the replacement costs for brake cables
prior to casually cutting them!!! Big nutter ebrake
cables can be spendy! You'd think that they should be
butt cheap but some of them are not.
Ebrake and clutch cable losening etc? At least try a
pair of needle nose style vice grips. Call me crazy,
MAC on me for not seeing who is the orginator of
inconsequential emails but at least give me the credit
for trying to prevent you from making mistakes that
have cost me money in the past...

Die grind the retaining nut(s) in half and discarding
them prior to ruining a potentially expensive ecable.
