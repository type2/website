&lt;&lt;  The backing plate seems like a straight forward sandblast and powder coat
job.
 Should I use gasoline and a brass brush?  Any thoughts?   &gt;&gt;
Hi Paul,
Plese never use gasoline to clean parts.  It vaporises too easily and the
next thing you know you are in a cloud of vapor that can easily be ignited by
very little effort.  Instead use kerosene and this does not vaporise or
ignite easily at room temps, until a direct flame is applied to it.  Or
better yet check your local area for a shop to hot tank or some other
cleaning service and have them do the dirty deed.  Eric&amp;Barb
