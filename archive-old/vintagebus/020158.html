You've made some logical leaps that would make the Bush Administration proud (*sniff*)

So, using your logic, if a company was dumping toxic waste in the river,
you should not boycott their products because Joe Smith who works there
is a really nice guy; somehow his being a nice guy should *protect*
the entire corporation?
 
Or we shouldn't fry Tim McVeigh, because his great aunt Sophie is such
a nice little old lady.

You probably also think Phillip Morris is a great company because they
give unmarketable produce away to the elderly.

The fact *still* remains that *VWOA* is using the ACVW for PR purposes
when and if it's convenient for them, and despite what little bit of 
benefit you see in your part of the world, the overall effect on the *rest* 
of the VW world is not positive.  If you think different, then I suggest
you set up a site with one of the bad words in the domain and see how
easy they go on you just because you attended their show.

Think globally, act locally.   

And try to stay focused on the issue at hand: VWOA (not VWAG) is shutting 
down sites while tooling those same enthusiasts for PR purposes.

&gt; Then will you boycott Bad Camberg because it is sponsored by Lotterman's a VW dealer as well as his son Stefan who is/was working at VWoA.
&gt; 
&gt; Or Dave Crompton's Kubel or Schwimmer parts because he works as a consultant to VWoA and VW AG on some of their historical needs.
&gt; 
&gt; How about Vince and Lynn Anderson who work at VWoa are club members and do many things that give recognition to the ACVW hobby.
&gt; 
&gt; The guy who gave me a brand new parts fieche for my bus that worked at VWoA.
&gt; 
&gt; The dealer guys that would search for obsolete stuff for me and do keys and locks for free if I brought them in.
&gt; 
&gt; Flame me all you want but you need to come here and experince the show before you judge someone based on their leagl department.
