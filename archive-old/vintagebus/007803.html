That would make sense. The front geometry of the bus didn't change between 65 &amp; 67, so you'd think the arms would fit.

&gt; I thought that the motor, linkage, and shafts were '65 only, but the arms
&gt; and blades were the same from around '61(?) up through '67.  I don't know
&gt; for sure, but this is my hunch.
