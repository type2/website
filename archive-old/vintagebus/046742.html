what do you mean by &quot;special&quot; (but not &quot;SO&quot;) model codes&quot;?

Did you know that there are many SO code not to do with campers?  SO-1 is the 
panel van with lifting up sales flap- there are SO-codes for the trucks with 
trailers to haul long things,  the trucks with lift up hydraulic cups for 
working on power lines etc etc etc.  I dunno if they stamp the SO codes on 
the m code plates.

 Regarding the &quot;special&quot; (but not &quot;SO&quot;) model codes,
 ie 21A, 22A, 21F (etc)
 
 Did these ever appear on the M-Code plate, or would they only appear
 on a letter from the museum?
 
 I've added support for these to the registry, but I'm not sure if
 I should put the codes in the select list for models in the m-code
 section.
