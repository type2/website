Well,

Compared to you long haul bussers, I feel wimpy.  Here are my stats:

miles: 895
gas:  38 gallons
average MPG:   23.55
gas cost: $too much!!!

I'm still recouping from the weekend and the drive up and back.  I had a blast though.  Well worth the effort. 

Not to bore too much with the details, but after a 4 hour delay fixing a miss that started the moment I pulled out of the driveway (at least it happened near the garage and the VWFLAPS), I was on my way from LA just in time to hit Friday LA traffic, and then the rain and turn on the wipers...the only thing I didn't fix/replace in the previous two weeks.  A stop for a rainX application fixed that.  8.5 hours of wind, rain and cold later I rolled into RB at 3:30am and crashed.  I think I won the latest arrival award...or at least should have.  BTW there were still people partying when I crashed on the back seat.  RB was good as others mentioned...a must hit if going up.  Met 3 great guys from Salt Lake.  Tom, Paul and Ben drove all the way from Utah (won the LD award) through snow in a Westy, a DC and a nice 23, so I have no place to complain with the paltry mileage I put in.  These guys are great...we laughed all day long.  


I hit up the split bus club and Ronnie and John for a place to camp, and they graciously let me spend the night with all of them at a very nice (want to go back)State park over in Santa Cruz.  Great asparagus, guys.  BTW John, send me the name of the season salt guy in Havasu.

Up at 5am to fly over the hill and through the dale to the line John, Ronnie, Gene and his wife and I went.  Cool to see all the people in line.  We opened up to graciously let Thom slide in.  Did'nt take long to get in, but I wish I'd of parked out side and saved the saw buck as there was a spot right in front of the gate...oh well, I parked next to Thom and had a good chat with him and the net famous John Henry of Diamond Green Oval fame near the end of the day(thanks for the handle Thom!).  Swap was good.  Found a og parts manual for a good price as well as a bunch of accelerator cables and a couple of bus distributors for 5 bucks. 

Out by 2pm to do the slow truck down south.  I stopped by Robert Davis's house in Santa Barbara (I thought) to drop off a package from Everett.  Turns out I left it at the wrong house (looked the same to me at 8pm and after 7 hours of driving :-) doh!!  All is well as he found it two days later.  

Made it home safely at around 10:45pm.  The 1600dp ran like a champ....not a hic up all weekend.  I can't believe that I actually built it!!  Thanks to all and really nice meeting everyone!  

Steve
