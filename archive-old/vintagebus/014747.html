I figure that it will take me about 365 days plus 3.5
hours. I need an extra year to let my Havasu related
reputation die down and my baby to grow up... ;-)

PS:
Katie and Matt: Don't drill holes into your bus's roof
or raingutter for that scanky C channel stuff! Fab
Westfalia style compression clips to hold it to the
raingutter from the back side. Common RV style C
channel can be purchased new at about any RV supply.
Clips would have to be fabricated. Seems to be fairly
simple to make.
