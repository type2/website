Subject:  RE: [VB] Cargo door lock on 66 bus

I'm sorry - you are absolutely correct!  It is a screw
rather than a pin here too!

Hi Rob,
Hmmm, mayhaps Australia bus have this differant.  N. American and Euro buses

have a very tiny slot tip screw that makes Tinker Bell look like a heavy 
wieght in comparison.  You first have to remove the screw that holds the 
inner handle on.  Then remove the outer handle and slide off the chrome 
collar around it.  Under the chrome collar is the tiny screw.  If the handle

is locked you will have to pick it or have a locksmith pick it.  Find an old

locksmith and have him do it properly and cut NOT grind you a new set of
keys 
off the key code on the handle.
