With friends like that, who needs enemas?

In reality it went down something like this: Jim's 'friend' fared poorly in a penny-a-hand
poker game, didn't have the $3 on him to cover, so he said &quot;Here, take my car!&quot;

Now I can see *why* you wanted the &quot;Nimrod&quot; badge!

Jim: Hey Ronnie, I'd like to get a gas cap for my Dasher
Ronnie: Sounds like an OK trade.
