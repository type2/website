&lt;&lt; I bought a German bug exhaust with two pea shooters that I thought would 
fit. It cleared the rear apron, but the bumper will not fit back on. Cwis 
Slaymaker had a tube that connected the two outlets into one tail pipe.  
Would this solve this problem? It seems I have seen the bug exhaust work for 
others. Is it a 1969 thing? &gt;&gt;

Hi Ric,
The reason VW went to a type 2 only muffler in 1959-1/2 on up is the bug/type 
1 muffler tips (and most aftermarket extractor mufflers.) ends up leaving a 
cloud of monoxide exhaust gas sucked up to the behind of the bus.  This 
monoxide can and will get sucked into the interior of the bus through any 
hole in the body or rear hatch seals and kill you and your passengers when 
traveling at speeds higher than 20 MPH.  Plus with the heater system on the 
engine itself will pump any monoxide that gets into the engine compartment 
into the interior of the bus!  Even at best a small constant exposure to 
monoxide might not kill someone, but will kill off too many brain cells and 
effect mental ability.  In other words it is a gas that should be treated 
with respect just as radiation is, the less you are exposed to either of 
these the better.  The type 2 muffler tip is postioned out to the left rear 
coner so as to cause the exhaust gas to be blown/sucked away by the air 
passing the left side of the bus.  Plus to install the bug muffler with it's 
tips one must cut the 1959-71 rear bumper to allow them clearance and this 
severly weakens the rear bumper to any rear end accident, and thus causes $$$ 
in rear body damage.    Eric&amp;Barb
