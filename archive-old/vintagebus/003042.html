I've checked the archives and really can't find an answer.  I've found how
to had Disc to a Splittie, but not if they're better or not.  Some of you
folks who have converted are they any better (the Disc)?
Is it worth the change?  I know I want to go with a 68/69 beam to get the
Ball Joints and I'm buying a 72 Camper (non-poptop) for the motor.  Thought
about using the Disc front end also.  I just like the wide 5 pattern better
and really don't like to use adapters.

Thanks
