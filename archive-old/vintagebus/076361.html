Subject: Re: [VB] front seat area? 

it's not a plate, it's actually stamped in the body in the engine bay. if i
remeber correctly it follows the angle of the leading edge of the rear apron.
could be filled with paint.  i suspect your bus was pieced together since it
doesn't have the pans.

    it should still be stamped in the body sheet metal by the rear apron on
the
    right side, if it's not, something is wrong. i have a 64 and a 67 that
both
    still have the vin there.
    i should have clarified, i was asking what the unknown m-code is.

  If its there its under too much paint. I thought you could only have one Vin
plate. Photo at http://www.thesamba_dot_com/vw/gallery/pix/86970.jpg.
  I should have said model code 2416 sorry.
