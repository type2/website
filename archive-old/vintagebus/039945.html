&gt; &gt; Ok.  I know I'm asking for alot of &quot;yeah rights&quot;, but here it is.  What 
&gt;is
&gt; &gt; the fastest you have ever gotten your bus to? and have you ever gotten a
&gt; &gt; speeding ticket on the open highway?  Please back up the high numbers 
&gt;with
&gt; &gt; hardware.
&gt;
I think there is someone out in the seattle area with a 65-67 that I would 
like to hear from. I was cruising up the freeway in the 63 going 65 when a 
split passed me like I was standing still, he was easily cruising 80 and 
didnt sound like it was struggling at all.
