Hello all-

In the further adventure of restoring my '67 Deluxe to somewhat 
original condition, I am in search of what apparently is a speaker
bracket that holds the radio speaker to the center grill area.

Any leads or a direct &quot;yes, I've got that (and would be willing to part
with it)&quot; would be lovely.
