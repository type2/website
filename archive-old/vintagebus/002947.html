Hey all,

Last night, driving to Grand Island, NY (my in-laws live there) I spotted a
White over blue 64 or so kombi.  First split I've seen outside of a show
driving around in about 4 or 5 months.  It also had a yellow line where the
beltline trim would normally go.  Didn't get much of a look at it.  I was
going the other direction with the family, otherwise I would have attempted
to turn around and talk to the driver...  Splitties are so few and far
between up here, my older daughter (5 years) almost made me go deaf from
yelling &quot;Daddy, look, there's a splittie bus!&quot; about 5 times right in my
ear.

Paul
