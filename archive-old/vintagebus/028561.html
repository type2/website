&gt;The attached Letter to the Editor was published in my local paper this
&gt;morning. I cannot let this one pass...I have to write back. I can think of
&gt;dozens of things to tell this guy, but I thought I would share his letter
&gt;with both lists and hopefully get even more facts to destroy this guy's
&gt;nonsense.

One thing I would mention is that because I keep my VW bus in good running
condition, I have had it for almost 13 years. How many SUVs have ended up
in landfills in that time? And not because of wrecks, but because new cars
(for the most part) are disposable. I've kept my bus on the road instead of
buying and disposing of countless other vehicles.

This smacks of &quot;Give smokers a break&quot;...heheh
