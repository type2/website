Hi Thom,
You could grease all the zerk fittings up, and then do some off road driving 
over lots of bumps and dips.  Best though to just take it apart, clean all 
the dirt/rust/dead grease out and inspect everything for wear and tear.  If 
all looks well reassemble and grease everything.  This latter method in our 
opinion really is manditory for any newly aquired old bus to do things right 
and allow new grease into areas where otherwise the dirt/rust/dead old grease 
might keep things clogged up from new grease getting to some of the moving 
surfaces.    Eric&amp;Barb
