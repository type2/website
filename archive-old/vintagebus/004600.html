The only difference in the 1300cc case and the early 1500cc/1600cc case
was....    Nothing. I had a running 1300cc engine that was running fine
until it violently chunked a sparkplug out of it.  Well, it was
un-repairable, and do you know how hard it is to find a 1300cc head?!? What
I did was dig in my stash, and replace the pistons and cylinders with some
NOS 1500cc (same size on the outside as the 1600cc) units, and found me a
good set of single port 1600cc heads and bolted it all up.  Ran like a
champ. Heck, that 1500cc engine was one of the best engines that I ever had.

I hope this helps

&gt; Hello all
&gt;
&gt; Turns out the engine case i got with my DC is in good shape.  The S/N#
&gt; turns out to be a 1965 1300 Bug case.  (Case # F6xxxxxxx)  This case had
&gt; a 69mm stroke and i think a 77mm bore originally.  From my &quot;hot rodding
&gt; a VW engine&quot; book it said something about needing to modify the heads to
&gt; allow it to be a 1600.  I test fitted the cylinders, crank and heads and
&gt; did not find anything that looked wrong.
&gt;
&gt; Any input out there?  What are the differrences in a 1300 case and a
&gt; early 1600 case?  (besides case savers, dual relief oil, larger oil pump
&gt; stud's.)  Anything that is not obviouse that i will find when i try and
&gt; mate the assy?
&gt;
&gt; Thanks
&gt;
&gt;
