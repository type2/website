Subject: Re: [VB] Swing Lever kit.  Trouble and questions

Betcha this kit will fit unless your beam is hacked. Not very pricey either.

Anyone out there know what the OD of the busing for
the Swing lever is suposed to be?    I am having a
heck of a time getting the right bushing.  I am on my
third kit and still i do not think it is right. 
Anyone know where to buy just the bushings?

What brand have you all used?  Where did you get it
and what did you pay?  I have the reamer and all the
gear to R&amp;R it but i need some bushing that will fit.
