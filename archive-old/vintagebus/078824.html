Subject: RE: [VB]gasoline etc

I be a phd chemist... bs in physics somewhere in there too... 

... let's start over as I pull out my CRC (and my head).

Atmospheric pressure does not affect the volumetric value for a liquid
(on first principals).  Changing the pressure will change the vapor
pressure of the liquid, not the volume of the liquid.

Temperature affects the volumetric value.

One thing about gasoline, over time, the 'light ends' or lower molecular
weight organic compounds will evaporate (function of temperature, i).
With the expansion from liquid to a gas, the build up in pressure pushes
some of the liquid out the vent tube.  A change in ambient pressure will
change the amount of the compound that can be in held in the gas (vapor
pressure).  I guess if all being equal, it would 'rain' in the tank if
you changed the pressure fast enough. 


Ok.  So I think before I said it wrong about the gasoline expansion...
my bad.  I would imagine the truckers have an issue with a large change
in temperature.... all I'm remembering is a problem in thermodynamics
once where we had to figure out why the truck tank was over flowing; you
know, one of those fun story problem things...


Oh, water has a density to temperature function that is 'U' shaped with
a minimum around 34F (2C).  That's why ice floats

&lt;snip&gt;
we need a petro engineer or physicist in on this one - does the 
GASOLINE expand, or does the increase in vapor pressure (basically, 
more gasoline turning into  vapor due to heat) FORCE the gas out of 
the filler neck etc. since liquids are incompressible, i'm willing to 
bet the increased vapor pressure PUSHING on the gasoline is the 
culprit.
