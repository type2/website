&gt;
&gt;I just got a 67 turn signal switch and harness over the weekend and had a 
&gt;question.  2 wires come off right after the start of the shrink wrap that 
&gt;could only go to a switch/knob on the dash.  One is brown (ground?) and one 
&gt;is blue.

The blue wire goes to the &quot;K&quot; terminal on the hazard light switch on
the dash.  It makes the bulb in the hazard light switch knob flash
when the hazards are on.

There are two brown wires.  One goes to ground - it is actually connected
to a &quot;ground&quot; terminal (31) on the windshield wiper switch.  The other,
which is probably longer, goes to the headlight relay.  These two brown
wires should be connected to one another when you click the turn signal
stalk for high beams.

&gt;I've tryed various connections and can't get my high beams to stay on.
&gt;I do have one hot wire that is unconnected that seems to patch in to
&gt;a wire going to both the light switch and hazard switch.

Take a look at http://www.vintagebus_dot_com/wiring/index.html .  The turn
signal switch should have nine wires in total coming off of it.  The
two browns and the blue have already been discussed.  The others are:

color                      goes to
black/green stripe         &quot;VR&quot; on 9 prong box
black/white stripe #1      &quot;VL&quot; on 9 prong box
black/green+white stripes  &quot;49a&quot; on 9 prong box
black/white stripe #2      connection with black/purple stripe (right rear)
black/white stripe #3      connection with black/yellow stripe (left rear)
black/purple stripe        &quot;54f&quot; on 9 prong box

&gt;Is there a diff w/ the 12v 67 and 6v 66 turnsignal switch, 
&gt;both have the exact harness and part numbers.

Electrically they are the same; mechanically I don't know.

Good luck!
