&gt; The engine tin that came with our new engine really is junk, poor
fitting,
&gt; stuff missing. When we pull the engine to retorque the heads, I want
to
&gt; replace it with something of quality. It is a 1776 dp, with a dog
house
&gt; cooler. Who makes the best stuff? Is the Scat tin any good?

The best tin is made by VW!  Even if you have to repair it, try to
keep the original tin.  There is quality tin available on the
aftermarket, but there is a lot of junk too.  Sometimes it is hard to
distinguish.  If you can't tell the difference yourself, stick to
reputable suppliers, preferably those who are present on the lists.

&gt; Any suggestions would be welcomed.  And has anyone ever ducted the
hot air
&gt; from the dog house cooler out the side of back of the bus, rather than
&gt; dumping underneath with all the rest of the heat?  Just a thought.

Once the hot air is out, it's out.  There would be no advantage to
exhausting it to the side, IMO.
