Gang -

What's the proper parked location of the wiper arms on a 65 Neunsitzer?  Parked left or right?  I know I can figure it out but I'm lazy.

And which way do the washer nozzles go?  I see the holes where the water piddles out, but the nozzles are handed: do they go with the jet part facing the center 
of the car or facing the outboard edges?

Update: I've got the jalousies in and most of the above-beltline area painted Rustoleum Gloss White, a specialty paint not available everywhere.  Redid the cab 
door window frames with all new rubber (except the felt and the ventwing-to-glass seals) and they look cherce.  POR-15'ed the back side of the front bumper last 
night (front of it will be white).  I hope to be driving it again this weekend, which I haven't been able to do for weeks because of all the windows being out.  Can't 
wait!

Thankee
Joe (who didn't make a note when he pulled wipers/washers off)
