Bill,

It's not that hard although if things are out
you will need some patience juggling splines.

(1) get the bus level - do this by making sure
the two longitudinal frame rails are level

(2) Unload the spring plates

(3) Measure the angle (from level or horizontal)
that they are at now.

(4) From memory (mine is notoriously bad) the stock
unloaded angle for bus is 20 degrees plus or minus half
a degree (can someone check this (?) I'm at work with no refs)

(5) If you measured where they are now you can actually work out 
the number of inner and outer splines to move to get em right.
Else you can pull them both out and start afresh.........
