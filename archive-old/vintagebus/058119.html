Subject: Re: [VB] Small nut versus big nut

Thanks everyone for the help!  I have more calculations to run through now
:)

&gt;I think small=1.32:1 Big 1.25:1, unless it has mountain gearing.

&gt;Generally if you are using a 4.375 R&amp;P with stock diameter tires you will
notice about 3MPH drop. With 3.975 R&amp;P and stock diameter tires it be more
like 6 MPH drop. 

From what I have been told and thought from Bentley the small nut RGBs will
bolt onto the late split swing plates so we are good to go in that respect.

The hard part now will be determining the power curve for the future engine
and corresponding that to the right tire size and R&amp;P (mebbe customish one,
I am sure the baja guys have all sorts of different ones available).   

Also need to get a hold of a set of small nut RGBs to be certain they will
work in my desired application...  Assuming the splines are the same as the
Beetle.

... To Be Continued...
