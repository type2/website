Subject: Re: [VB] JOSHUA WAS RIGHT ...

What this reminds me of is why we learn to figure what is wrong with the bus ourselves.   I have this sneaking suspicion that you didn't actually check the bolts, as was suggested then. (I remember that several people chimed in on the loose bolt possibilty)  Or check out the bus, even if you didn't want to fix it yourself.   I mean you would have known that the bolts were loose back then, and maybe that one wasn't broken yet. 

 We at the other side of computers can't tell for sure what is the problem, though we have ideas and experience.    

oh, Diane, don't discount the possibility  that in addition to the loose bolts you also have play at the fp/daisy wheel area.   did you check for axle slop?
