&gt;Well, a lot of those snake-oil salesmen drain the oil out of engines and
&gt;run them for long periods of time to prove how good their snake oil is.
&gt;What they don't tell you is that it works as well without the snake oil.

George's post reminded me of this link from the type2_dot_com Library:
 
http://neptune.spacebears_dot_com/cars/legal/oiladd.html#seven

Basically, Briggs and Stratton found that their engines would run just
fine without oil for 20 hours straight.  Upon tear-down there was some
bearing damage, though.  The article has more detail and the rest of it
is pretty good, too.
