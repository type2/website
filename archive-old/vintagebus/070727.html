Subject: Engine Removal

Good Morning All,
I am attempting to remove the engine from a 60 DC.  I did not think in
advance that it would be different from a bay window.
So, I am covered in dirt, awaiting a little advice.
I assume there are 4 bolts??  I have found 2, inside a bracket that looks to
the tranny mount. and possibly on behind the shroud, ala the bay window
where the starter bolts on through the firewall.
Is there another?

Beep Beep,
HapyBus
