Subject: Books with changes through the years?
Message-ID: &lt;Pine.LNX.4.10.10011162202460.20688-100000_at_birdbird&gt;

Hello all!

Just curious about Bus books.  Specifically, those that list the
various years and the dates or chassis numbers that certain changes
occurred.  So far I've come up with the following:

Bentley notes some changes but they're all over the book

Muir has a brief list in the back

&quot;Progressive Refinements&quot;   Who wrote this?  Is it still available?

&quot;VW Transporter  Die technische Dokumentation 1950-1990&quot;, Stefan Doliwa.
(I got this book in Germany and it's in German.  I am learning all kinds
of German words for the parts of a Bus now.  Allegedly there's an English
version but I haven't been able to find it.)
 
Are there others out there?  Any titles to look for or avoid?

Thanks!

Matt Roberds
