Remember Nellie- the 65 I saved, with many posts about that that and the
other, switched a tranny in, drove to e WA and brough back a nose clip on the
roof (as shown in OBR), and drove to Calof and painted, and has been sitting
for a bout 6 months, pretty much since spring meet at puyalup, as the tranny
is very upset?   Well, it's time to get dirty again.   I pulled the bumper,
which was awkward due the the bit to hold the muffler on the L bracket, and
the motor out, and futzed with undoing some tranny bits.  I am glad to say I
keept if fairly clean in there, but it always could be cleaner.  hm.   Tranny
arrived, and axles were attached.   more later, time for a bath.    I will see
what a 3.875 does to me, and if i like it, and maybe will go out to the
Okanagan Barter Fair in October, that's a nice trip.   Maybe, I might not.    

think it'll be a pain to do this time.   Will see on Tuesday.
