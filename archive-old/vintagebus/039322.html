Hey, it's Friday, I'll jump in here, just because.

My first bus was s '64 Deluxe with a tired 1500.
WOT top speed was 54 mph.  I learned to love it,
learned to deal with it, learned to pull over.
It didn't do much better with a rebuild either.

It really made driving an on/off throttle thing.

To go, foot down; to slow down, remove foot.
To stop, switch foot to other pedal.

I wish my second bus had had such a limit.
The '67 Deluxe's engine got toasted
by a-non-VW driver.  He was going 65 mph with
three kayaks on top, until the engine blew.

Replace the engine with a cheap rebuild, hit
the road a day later and hit a deer, missed the
river permit and meeting with the support raft.
Every time I drove that bus something major
broke, hated that bus.  Wish I had kept the
rusty, slow '64.

A governor is a good idea if bus is to be used
by a no-VW person.
