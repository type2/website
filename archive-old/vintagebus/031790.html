Somewhere i the archives is an artical posted from autoweek or some other
auto publication that told of the new show microbus. This was posted a few
weeks ago but I couldn't find it. VW has had a few prototypes (clays) made
of the new Microbus that all were scrapped due to the thinking of the German
side of VW. The current microbus model is a carryover from these prototypes
and were designed by the same group that did the NEW beetle (who are no
longer with VW). In the last year or so VW design group has lost about all
there key players and have been regrouping to try to do something
innovative. How do I know you wonder. One of my very closet friends wife was
one of these people and left to work for another design group and to this
day cannot tell me the real facts (one of those contract confidentiality
clauses).

&gt; Hello all!
&gt;
&gt; If the rumored New Microbus looks anything like the renderings that
&gt; Hot VWs published a little after the New Beetle came out, you'll
&gt; find me down at the local dealer drooling on one.  It'll probably
&gt; be a bit beyond my means right now, though.  I still have to spend
&gt; some more money on the '64... :)

Don't get your hopes up.  Those were Steve Carrington?? FANTASY renderings.
Those were his dream ideas if he were designing the thing with NO regard to
current safety regulations or crash worthiness.  Much like our beloved
splits
;-)

&gt;
&gt;
&gt; I'm wondering...what do y'all think this New Microbus, if it comes out,
&gt; will do to the market for air-cooled Buses?

I don't want to think about it


&gt; I wasn't paying very
&gt; close attention but it seems that interest in and prices of real
&gt; Beetles went up when the New Beetle came out.

Yep.  Hopefully the coming recession will keep the already over inflated
prices in check.


Steve
