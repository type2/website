Subject: fair price for a progressive carb manifold

hey volks,

i was hoping to get some advice: 
what's a fair price for a manifold{currently has a weber progressive on 
it} 
what's a fair price for the carb? {i know that most people either love em 
or hate em, i have no experience either way, so i don't care...}

the reason is, i'm selling them and i want to list a fair price.

thanks,
matthew
