Hi, Volks.  In Aridzona there is a new commercial on TV.  It stars a
1963 23 window deluxe, totaly restored.  Looks awesome.  Only problem
two rightoues hippes are driving it to a local VW dealer to check out
the new VW's.  As the get out they are sorta down about giving up the
bus.  But they walk into the showroom and are toalay in awe over the new
Beetle.  Well they buy one and do a high five and then they are
transformed into Yuppies.

The commercial is being run by Camelback Volkswagen here in Phoenix
Aridzona.  Just thought you would like to know, There are still buses
being traded in for NEW VW's.
