Anytime you buy a used car the rule is &quot;Buyer Beware&quot;.
I've had the opportunity to open up about six type IV engines over the
past seven years and I've found connecting rods with the lube hole facing
down, cases that had the sealing surfaces filed on (maybe just scraped
too much), threaded holes behind the standard oil cooler seals, pistons
with broken groves and rings, valve seats hanging on the valve stems, and
valves that dropped the seat back into the exhaust port and of course
lots and lots of various colors of silicone gasket sealer and adhesives, 

One of the most popular is the oversized oil drain plug and spark plugs
with household aluminum foil wrapped around the threads to bind it into
the head.

In your particular case I would suggest that you buy a gasket set and
replace both front and rear main seals and then replace absolutely every
other gasket that you can that doesn't require splitting the case.

I blew a piston on #3 cylinder and there was so much crankcase pressure
that I had oil everywhere in the engine compartment and under the car. My
saving grace was that I saw oil clouding the rear window and pulled off
the road and got parked just as the *zero* oil pressure set off the idiot
light so I did not lock up the engine.

PO's can be the worst liars in the world. If they can't produce a receipt
for the parts or the work they claim; just assume you're being scammed
and pay accordingly.
