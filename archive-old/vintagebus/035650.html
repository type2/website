&lt;&lt; As I recall, fuel line has to be certified and marked by the manufacturer,
 same as brake line.  I doubt that the fuel line you get at your flaps will
 be substandard.&gt;&gt;
Hi George,
Yes, but what is the standards?  6 months, 1 year or more?  

&lt;&lt;As far as quality of rubber, I'm not all that impressed with German rubber. 
 Fuel lines that I replace every two years generally have cracks in their 
ends, where the SAE lines I put in my C*evy 5 years ago look fine.&gt;&gt;
 We have seen several times in American automobiles when thier fuel line 
suddenly  has a pin hole crack without warning.  Most of the time around the 
center of the length.  We rather have a fuel line that gives you a warning at 
it's ends that it is time to replace or fry!
