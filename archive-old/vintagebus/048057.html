&lt;&lt; Uhhh, in what part of the world?  I have a friend who can send you on some
 interesting adventures in the Sinai Desert.  I can send you on interesting
 drives in Southern California and North-eastern Oregon.  I'm sure that the Oz
 listmembers have some favorite un-roads... It would really help to know from
 whence you're traveling.  * &gt;&gt;

Yeah, I forgot that part, from the Sacramento region of the world.
