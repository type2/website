Subject: Re: [VB] Mounting trailer hitch

I have a westy hitch, and never bothered bolting it up to the bumper.
I think the bulk of your tongue weight will be borne by the side arms
that to under the bumper *brackets*.

&gt; I have an old trailer hitch, the kind that attaches to the torsion bar tubes 
&gt; with u bolts, and to the rear bumper for tongue weight.
&gt; I looked in the archives for wisdom on the best way to make the rear bumper 
&gt; end of this strong enough for tongue weights, and found no consensus.
&gt; Have folks done this in a way they are very happy with and would like to 
&gt; share?
