Subject: Re: [VB] Spring plate angle - lost settings...

&gt; I have purchased a magnetic angle finder - however this isn't the greatest

A half-degree step is fine, you can read finer than that.  I use a regular
protractor.

&gt; With this I have found that my bus isn't level from side to side - it looks to
&gt; be about half a degree difference, and that the back to front angle is also
&gt; slightly different on each side.    Can this back to front angle be
&gt; compensated for by modifying the front tyre pressure in one tyre?  What effect
&gt; will the side to side difference have?  Why couldn't the builders make my
&gt; garage floor perfectly flat??

measuring on a flat floor is important.  No sense in correcting errors in
the bus when the error is in the floor!

&gt; Anything I should look out for whilst doing this - or anyone got any tips on
&gt; how to make sure I get this right- I would prefer to not have to strip down
&gt; and retry the settings if possible!

When measuing the spring plate angle, be sure to lift the spring plate to
take the slack out of the splines.

Resist the urge to crank in a little extra twist.  Stick with the specs!

Measure twice, cut once.
