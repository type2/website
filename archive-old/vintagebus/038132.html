This is a very interesting subject indeed...

A friend of mine has a 66 sliding door walkthrough standard which was velvet 
green and that &quot;white color&quot; and after years of sitting outside you can see 
the green through the white.  On this bus the green was sprayed first I 
believe and then they sprayed the top color.  

My 57 deluxe was sprayed sealing wax red and then topped off with the 
chestnut brown.  

Some have told me that there was a change in the way they did this.  

Early models are the bottom color on the inside.  Many later models are the 
top color on the inside. Was there really ever a change like that? This is 
just what I have seen and the sliding door really threw me off.
