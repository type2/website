Subject: Good Info about CB044 Heads

Here's some good info that you will need to know when running CB's 044
heads.  I've learned a couple of things tonight that I wasn't told so maybe
it will help you out.

First off, I called CB to get the spark plug reference numbers for their
heads:

Bosch - XR4CS
NGK - DP8EA9
Autolite - 4153
Motorkraft - H622
Champion - (I didn't ask because Champion plugs are well known as cheap junk
that blow cores.)

Nobody in town had these plugs so I called my good friend Frank Musil in
Lincoln, NE and had him search for me and of course, he found them! (Good
ol' Frank -thanks!!!)  He was able to reference the Autolite number and come
up with them.  Now here's why I couldn't find them down here - they are
motorcycle plugs - 14mm dia. and a 3/4&quot; reach.  Had I known this before, I
could have chosen 1 of 2 motorcycle shops in town (one right next door to
where I work - I could throw a rock and take out their front window) and had
the plugs I needed.

Anyway, thanks to Frank, I now have plugs for my CB heads.

The other item I ran across at Autozone is a nice little packet called a
&quot;Tune-Up Kit&quot; (Part #26984) and it consists of a nice little tube of
dielectric grease (great stuff to have if you want to pay attention to
detail) and a little packet of anti-seize to use on the plug threads.  I
guarantee you with 3/4&quot; of steel to aluminum contact, you DON'T want any
thing to seize or you are in deep manure!

The grease is used on any connection where your plugs and wires touch so
they will slip on and off easily without leaving you with wires pulled out
of boots and boots left on plugs and so forth.  This is also what you can
lube your dizzy shaft with where the rubbing block of the points touch.
Total with tax on this kit was $2.12 and I'm glad I got it.

The plugs are now gapped and installed but I haven't run the wires yet.

TTYAL (talk to you all later)
