Greetings Honorable Bus List Members:

While enjoying a La Perla Habana Maduro Torpedo, and contemplating my trip
next month to the Black Rock Desert's Playa in Nevada, a concern that I am
having is the alkaline dust that is reportedly everywhere on the playa and
can get into everything.

I am taking my 67 21DLX and camping for a week on the playa, a (mostly)
dried, prehistoric lake bed. I will be traveling off road about five to
fifteen miles on the playa to camp site (could be thirty miles round trip
off road). A good number of vehicles will be attending, causing a lot of
this dust to be airborne. Also, dust storms occur from time to time.

Questions: (1) Would a paper air filter or stock oil bath filter be more
effective in this situation? (2) Round trip is 1,200 miles. Would the dusty
conditions require that I change the motor oil before making the trip home?
What would you do? I have no external motor oil filter system, running a
1776. (3) Any tips or FYI on any preventive actions I could take to lessen
the dust contamination in my bus? When back home, I will give my bus a good
rinse, under, in and all around.

Any experiences and/or tips would be valued.
