Ok,

FOr all the responses, I think many missed the fact that airfare prices are
the key to this... $60 each way from Seattle, it doesn't make sense to then
spend another $55 each way to fly the last 120 miles.

I have to decide today (as does anyone else considering the great Southwest
airline fares that end at midnight PST tonight).

Sounds like Beto can give us a ride there... but I found out that the
flights work out so we would arrive in Vegas 9:25am Friday and depart Las
Vegas at 7:20am Monday.  So we would either need to get a hotel in Vegas
Sunday night or is anyone going back to Vegas late Sunday night.

I presume that this Lake Havasu site has good tent camping?  I haven't heard
much comment on this...

  Stephen
