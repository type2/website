We did it!  4,050 miles in a '63 double cab!! Only problem was I had to
clean the battery cables to get it to start in New Mexico. All that hard
work ( and money spent ) was worth it.
We ( my wife, Donna &amp; I ) left Harrison, Ark on Sept 30. It was hot going
across Okla and New Mexico. We were running against the wind and climbing,
too. I watched the oil temp pretty close &amp; a couple of times I dropped back
to 3rd at about 40 mph to let it  cool. The 1914 / weber 44s     had plenty
of  power to climb the hills, but I couldn't use it without building too
much heat. Kind  of frustrating.
At a rest area just before Yuma, Az I pulled in to let it cool for a while &amp;
got to talking to a young man named Mark from Sacramento who has a bus. I
think Mark subscribes to this list??
Anyway, we went on to El Centro, Ca. Got our supplies &amp; went to San Felipe,
Baja Ca. where we spent 10 days camped on the beach. We were joined there by
my daughter and her family  from Redding, Ca.
Then, on our way back home, the weather had cooled some. I could go as fast
as I wanted to  ( 65 ) without getting too hot. We went down to the south
part of Ariz, saw the copper  mines at Bisbee, then back through New Mexico.
Just north of Las Cruces we stopped and admired some of the stuff at Indian
Rock V W &amp; trike shop. Then we stopped at Continental in Alamogordo, but
they were closed.
We did some serious  mountian climbing here. We went through Ruidoso toward
Roswell &amp; got into a really bad rain/wind/hail storm. We spent the night in
Roswell &amp; drove through fog most of the next morning.
Alltogether we were gone for  20 days &amp; enjoyed every minute of it. Thanks
for listening.
