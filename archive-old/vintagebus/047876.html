Woooo hoooo!
Progress on the 57!!!!
Rims are blasted, powdercoated semi-flat black, the faces are painted two 
toned L311/L312, steel valve stems, and new firestones are mounted!
Two tones rims are a PAIN IN THE A&amp;* to paint! I had to break out the 
airbrush for some fine detail in the slots!!!!!
It rolls for the first time in 6 months!!!!
Started doing some metal work to the body.
Hammering out big dents, heating the metal up and shrinking it flat.
Its coming out very nice. There are two small low spots on the long panel 
where the inner brace is (Cant pull those out with the nail gun).
I guess its better than the HUGE nasty dents that were there before!
There was also a pinch on the tip of the &quot;V&quot; for the nose. It extended 
slightly past the seams.
Check out the photos. 
The front bumpers NOT MINE, belongs to a friend of mine, I just mounted it on 
for effect!!!!
