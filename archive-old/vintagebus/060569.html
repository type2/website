Subject: More Electrical Mysteries

Okay, so I grounded my rear tail lights on the 60 Single Cab. Tail lights are 
nice and bright. I still have a couple of electrical mysteries between me and 
my first ride!

1) When I step on the brake with tail lights on, the right side stays lit as 
a tail light--does not get brighter like the left side does. With the tail 
lights off, the right brake works okay.

2) Still no turn signal at right rear. Right front blinks fast fast fast. I 
checked the directional switch with a test light and that is working fine. 
Checked the flasher relay (3 prong) and it is working fine. Cleaned all 
contacts. Checked bulb. What should I do next? I have not hooked up all my 
wires to the speedo yet--does the one for the signal need to be hooked up for 
the right rear to work?

3) Hooked up license plate light. Works fine with engine lid in &quot;up&quot; 
position. The minute I start lowering the engine lid it goes out and stays 
out. Connections are clean and tight at the fixture, and the ground is good. 
???

Apperciate all the help. I'm almost there.
