Hi All,

I'm putting the front beam back together on my 59 dc.  The beam is out of
the bus and on a stand.
http://www.dsquared-dev_dot_com/davem/frontbm.htm

Here are a few questions:
- When refitting the top torsion arm, I have to twist it up a bit to go over
the rubber snub.  Once in place, the top torsion arm is firmly pressed
against the snub.  Is this correct?????

- also, I'm trying to use a set of empi shocks and some have already told me
that they won't fit but that hasn't stopped me from trying ;-)
   anyway, the shocks are basically 1 inch or so too long so the question
becomes how frequently or likely is it to bottom out the front suspension in
*normal* driving conditions.  The dc is not destined to become some form of
off road vehicle so if I take it easy, could I use these with out worrying
about bottoming out the shocks before the lower torsion arm bumps into the
snub.


TIA


David
