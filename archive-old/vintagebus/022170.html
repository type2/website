&gt;I was over at a guys house yesterday that owns a 1960 Bus.  It still had
the original transmission in it due to low mileage.  The owner said that
1st gear has no synchros, similar to my '55 split-case tranny.  He reported
that this was normal for the early tunnel-case transmissions, sort of an
in-between thing.  I was surprised, I thought once the tunnel-case came
around, all forward gears had synchros.  True or False?

Everett,

My records say that in May 19, 1959 at chassis # 469 447 the bus changed 
to the tunnel case transaxle with full synchronized forward gears.
