You're right, it is very unlikely that any of the Havasu boys would put a 
guage on a bus.        But   I can always suggest it.:):):)    This 
electronic ignition bit seems a sorry excuse to me.   I would expect Ronnie 
to have spare point around, maybe just pop another dist in for a short ride.  
highly improbable, though at one point I seem to remember hewas going to 
install about 20 guages.

Yeah,
Like you'll get one of those Havasu boys to put a GAUGE on one of their 
buses!  I can see VWHoward gettin his fingers ready for another gauge thread. 
 haha

&gt;  In flat areas (like 
&gt;  Az) I did not have hill problems.
&gt;  
&gt;  would be interested in how yours tachs out, in 3rd not just 4th, just to 
see 
&gt; 
&gt;  if it is the same as my bus  (though I am not sure what my 3rd gear is)
