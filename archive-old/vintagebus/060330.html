Subject: Re: [VB] 40 HP heads - reconditioning

If you read thru wilson, he recommends that exhuast valves always be
replaced. dont know how much valves would cost for a 40 horse but 1600
valves are pretty cheap.

Subject: [VB] 40 HP heads - reconditioning


So I'm pulling my motor tomorrow and I'm going to take the heads off and
using Muir and Tom Wilson's book I'm going to check things out etc..  I'm
taking my heads to a local machine shop that a stranger in a beetle
recommended. What should I watch for?  What should I tell em? I'm kinda
worried that they'll tell me that valves need to be replaced or something
and I won't be able to tell em what kinda I want or from where I would like
then to come. I would rather cheapo parts where not used but unless I know
what I want .....

TIA
