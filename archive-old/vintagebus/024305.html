Barb, Eric, George, and the List,
	I think that I'm leaning toward an electric-fan-driven recirculating
system... with two of the bilge blowers on the &quot;cold&quot; side of the heater
boxes (for my paranoia about heat damaging the fans, which Barb &amp; Eric
brought up)... and intake air for the fans ducted from beneath the rear
seats or from under the spare tire, whatever seems best at the time. 
	I am curious, though, as to why you say it is necessary to have some
positive air pressure to the heater boxes all the time... since it is
for the most part completely sealed off when the heater is not
operational (heater flaps closed), which would seem to negate the idea
of air actually flowing through there.  
	I think that to truly have a recirculating system without using
electric fans, one would have to have a way to seal/unseal the engine
air ducts on the outside of the body... in addition to having an
appropriately sized duct from the passenger compartment to the engine
compartment, to provide enough airflow for the heater and a greater
amount for engine cooling. Otherwise, i think that the cold outside air
coming in from the louvered ducts would offset any pre-warmed air coming
from the passenger compartment. 
	But... I just reread Barb &amp; Eric's post to clarify this (my
misunderstanding)... It would be a partially recirculating system, but
would work more efficiently than the present system by reducing the
backpressure in the interior compartment... okay, I get it now. 
	I think I'm still leaning towards the electric fan recirculating
system... a la Lyle... I do think lessening the backpressure to the
interior compartment will no doubt have great benefits, but I think that
a true recirculating system would be a degree better than that.  ...but
I'm stumped on the necessity for constant air pressure in the heater
boxes.

&gt; Why not take this one step further and make the heating system
&gt; recirculating?  Run a duct from the back of the passenger compartment
&gt; into the engine bay.  Connect this duct to an electric fan and the
&gt; output from the fan to the heat exchangers.
&gt; 
&gt; This way, the exchangers get already-warmed air from the passenger
&gt; compartment, rather than having to heat cold outside air.
&gt; 
&gt; The intake for the fan could be located behind the spare tire, where
&gt; it is out of the way and unlikely to be blocked inadvertantly.
&gt; 
&gt; You would also have to provide a way to keep air flowing through the
&gt; heat exchangers when the heat is off.  You could just leave the fan on
&gt; &quot;low&quot; speed all the time, or you could work out some sort of &quot;flapper
&gt; valve&quot; that would allow air from the engine fan to go to the boxes
&gt; unless the electric fan starts blasting away.
