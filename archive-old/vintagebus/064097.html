Subject: Stud size vs head type

With 8mm vs 10mm, does it matter what size vs what head? I have an AH
block and SP heads, I assume I have 8mm with case savers? I was
wondering if there are any circumstances of heads in which you require
10 or 8 specifically. I will measure them tonight to check.
Thanks,
AL
