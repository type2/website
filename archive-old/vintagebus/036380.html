I am going to make it for sure. The whole family is coming too. I will
be driving a primered 55 Single Cab. The single cab is for sale for
$2800 OBO and I don't want to drive it home. (Not that that is a
shameless plug or anything.)

We will also have the 60 Crew Cab back. I can't wait to drive it again
it has been too long. 



Come up and say Hi.

PS Our show is coming up on Sunday August 8 in beautiful downtown Hood
River Oregon. We will be raffling off a 71 Deluxe with partial Westy
interior. So come on down.
