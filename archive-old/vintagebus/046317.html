Hi Andrew,
Those are a very unusual accessory back up lights with the eyebrow pressed in 
the upper part of the frame.  If you check Foreign Imports Magazine in the 
early to late 60s these were sold by Polly Imports, and certainly others.  
You can use a lense from a 67 bug or late 67 to 71 bus reverse light to fill 
the hole.  The eyebrow lenses are very differant from the stock Vw reverse 
light lenses.  If you replace both your lenses with the stock Vw lenses we 
could use your one eyebrow lense!
