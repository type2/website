Subject: URGENT: DENVER, CO - Out of Town VW Owner Needs Your Help

Bus Club Members:

I am posting this message on behalf of Martin, a fellow from Montreal who 
purchased a 1975 Westy in Nevada and who became stranded in Denver on his 
way back to Montreal.

Martin has dealt with many difficulties getting his new bus home, and has 
run out of time and money for finishing the trip.  He needs someplace to 
store his bus in the Denver area until May, when he can come back and 
continue the journey to Montreal.  He works for Canada Air, so he will have 
no trouble taking a plane home or getting back here in May when he can 
continue his journey.

Martin can be reached at 303-739-2882 for the next few hours.  Any help you 
can give him would be very appreciated.

Richard
