&gt; One of my customers that live in NYC says there is a bank in NYC that

&gt; uses a 21 window as a free taxi for any of their card caring
members.
&gt; He told me he would try to get a picture if he could. Has anyone else

&gt; seen this bus running around the city?

Mario,

2 items -

1.  Yes, I was in NYC and saw the bus.  I didn't have my camera 
but I do recall it was a bank that had the logo on the side.

2.  It is not cool what you've done to your rep with some 
other VERY reputable people on this list.  I'm honestly surprised 
you have the bones to post here.

Paul
