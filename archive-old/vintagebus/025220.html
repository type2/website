Buck,

I made the same mistake and another list member, David Schwartz,
caught it. What you are doing is leaning out your mixture by letting
air into the intake manifold. The air just travels through the case
first. You need to connect the crankcase vent to the other side of the
carb. The setup you have now is just like an intake manifold leak and
will cause all the same problems.
