Has anyone else noticed that the Japanese seem to respect the busses as much 
if not more than we do here in the US?  I don't understand why the Japanese 
interest in Veedubs is being taken as such a negative thing.  So what if you 
aren't going to pass that bus on I-95 anymore?  It may very well be better 
preserved for future generations in Japan.
