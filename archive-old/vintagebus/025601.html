Subject: Fantastic 12V to 6V Conversion Page.
Message-ID: &lt;3774707F.A9F971F4_at_dolphinsci_dot_com&gt;

Earlier today, I offered to write up a page describing the problems of using a
resistor for voltage drop with devices such as a radio and how to build a
regulator to get around that problem.  I thought about the page, came up with
an outline, figured that I would add in some photos, graphs and schematics.
Ok, this is a bit more than a quick crank it out, I'll put it together when I
get back from New Orleans.

Then this evening I got a message from Eric&amp;Barb:
&gt; Hi Scott,
&gt; Okay, can you describe or explain a system that would work for radios or
&gt; others devises?  We have many early VW radios that do work on both voltages
&gt; so there must be a way.
&gt; Any information you could whip up would be very helpful.  Thanks, Eric&amp;Barb

So, I did a little scratching and the page is all done.  The catch is... I did
not do it, but after reading it over and examining the schematics and photos,
the description and outline of my page above, is exactly how this page is
written.  I was going to add a few graphs in the initial portion, but hey, the
page is done and it is available NOW.  Go by and print out the page as it makes
for good study material.  If you have any questions, feel free to fire away at
me and I'll be happy to answer away.

And now without further ado, the page is at:

http://www.sonic_dot_net/~sdelanty/6to12to6/

JC Whitney and a number of other places, sell a voltage drop device that is
used for the windshield wipers and has a variable control on it so that you can
speed up and slow down the wipers.  It sells for around $38US.  This device
would work for the radio also if you are not the wire and solder type.  You
need a volt meter to set it properly for the radio.  You could apply 12V to it
and adjust the control for 6.0 to 6.5V output.  Once you have it set, you might
devise a way to fix the knob in place so the voltage does not change on you by
accident.

Now the regulator described in the link above will provide
6V _at_ 1.0Amp   $6.20US  good for gauges and dash lamps that you do not want to
change out.

adding a bypass transistor will get you up to
6V _at_ 6.0 Amp with peaks to 10amps  great for radios.  Use a bigger heat sink
and the unit will provide 10amps continuous.  That should take care of most
radios that you care to throw at it.

Everything should be less than $10-$15 and a bit of elbow grease, AND the unit
is a much sturdier and dependable regulator than the $40 one from JCW.

Happy Converting.

Scott

   Passing Thought -
        If at first you don't succeed.....get new batteries.
