Subject: RE: [VB] What exhaust should I use?

One of the problems with jetting exaust to the rear of a bus instead of the
side is airflow. Airflow studies show that the exaust vented to the rear is
sucked up by the air flowing over the rear roof and is dragged to the side
in mini vortexes. Some of this exaust air actully gets sucked into the fresh
air intakes along the side of the van puttin carbonmonoxide laden air into
the fresh air system and your heating air. VW did these studies back in 49
and many have been done over the years, but that is why you see factory
exaust on vans and trucks vented to the side and down. That's why bug
exaust, even if you modify the rear apron so the two tubes can clear, will
not work on a bus.

&gt;Ronnie,

I'll agree that a  bug is different than a bus but i
believe that the tests were done on a bench and not in
the car (in the book at least)though I haven't looked
at that book(or any of Bergs for that manner) in days.
I have tried both and use the stock exhaust but i can
remember my header set-up running just as well if not
a little more peppy. I thought exhaust didn't really
come into any real importance until you got into
really changing the configuration of the engine;
Larger valves, bigger carbs, porting ect. It is
interseting in your case. I assume that the motor runs
good and cool. I'll keep that in mind as i plan to run
a 1776 in the future.

   Sean, all I can say is try it. A bug (which is
&gt; what the books refer to)
&gt; is a lot different then a bus. What I say is what I
&gt; have tested and
&gt; experienced myself. I have a 1776 single port with a
&gt; PICT 34 on it and found
&gt; I had much better low end with a stock bus exhaust
&gt; then a header. Also think
&gt; about it. A beetle has 2 tailpipes, a bus has only
&gt; one. VW must have tested
&gt; the exhaust and determined that the single tip must
&gt; have given the bus more
&gt; bottom end to help move it. Same muffler, just 1 tip
&gt; verses 2.

&gt; 
&gt;  Is a 1641cc considered small bore? That's news to
&gt; me.
&gt; There is a good section on exhaust in the &quot;How to
&gt; Hot
&gt; Rod your VW&quot; that recommends an equal length header
&gt; for a 1600cc. I also seem to remember HotVW's doing
&gt; a
&gt; test a few years ago with the same results. I
&gt; couldn't
&gt; tell you about the effects on a 36 or 25Hp motor.

&gt; &gt; The problem with running a header on a small bore
&gt; &gt; bus engine is the loss of
&gt; &gt; bottom end torque. We have tested that here is AZ,
&gt; &gt; in 100 plus heat and
&gt; &gt; found that a stock muffler gives you better bottom
&gt; &gt; end and have not seen any
&gt; &gt; difference in engine temps, touch the dipstick

&gt; &gt; ronnie; stock muff unless I'm running big engine
&gt; &gt; stuff, working on a design
&gt; &gt; for a big bore stock looking muffler. Did those
&gt; &gt; years ago on 356 Porsche's,
&gt; &gt; so I don't see why it can't be done on a bus.

&gt; &gt; What about a &quot;Zoom Tube&quot;? Would this clear the

&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Hello All,
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; I'm running a 1641 DP in my '65 bus. It has a
&gt; &gt; stock bug exaust. The little
&gt; &gt; &gt; chrome tips are conflicting with the rear
&gt; bumper?
&gt; &gt; Is there any way to get
&gt; &gt; &gt; around this without cutting the bumper? Is there
&gt; &gt; another exaust that is
&gt; &gt; &gt; recomended? Thank you very much.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
