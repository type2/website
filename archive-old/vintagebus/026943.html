&gt; If the flywheels went right in (12V into 6V ) then someone has beat you to

I think you are right there.

I am familiar with the differences in gear rings on the flywheels and
starter gears and also the busings and holes in the trans case.... I
had, until you and E and B pointed out, believed that the 200mm 6v
flywheel was the same od as a 12v 200mm.... with the corect gear teeth
for a 6v starter.  And that isnt even getting into o-ring differences
and paper vs metal endplay shims...

 So what did the trans case look like for the 12v option buses? In
comparison to the 67 and later 12v flywheels and the 67 and later trans
cases? 
 
Always learning...
