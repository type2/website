Hey Travis,

I live in upstate SC and went to high country last year and have cruised all 
over the bluerighe PKWY in by bus.  He's a 66 dlx w/ stock trany and 1600 DP 
that has fluctuated between a 30/31 pic 1 and curently a 34 pic 3.  He has 
15in beetle rims (soon to be 15in bus in back and 14bus in front) and had 
205/75/15 for his first 6 months w/ me and now he's running 195/60/15.  I 
have no problem climbing!  Between the tires no diff of the line just 5mph 
off the top speed at 3900.  I cruise 65 now before I would cruise 70 and was 
probably going faster than that due to inaccurate speedo.  I'm thinking your 
bus should climb way better.  I don't think I've ever went below 43 or so.  
Hardest climb for the bus is heading for NC from Greenville, SC on 25 that 
20 mile or so constant slope!

Good Luck,

66dlxhrdtpwkendr

with a little lower RPM.
&gt;More of what he's really looking for is to have more hill pulling ability.  
&gt;He frequently slows to
&gt;25-30mph in 70mph zones, on highways and interstates.
