&gt; I have one of the COSTCO ones.  It's holding up nicely so far.
&gt; I didnd't have it anchored, because it's on cement.  We had 50mph

&gt; nestled between the house and 2 6' high fences.  If you were putting it out
&gt; in the openm, make sure to clamp it down well.

If you decide to use weights to hold it down, be sure that the tiedowns
will break before the weights lift off of the ground.  Better to lose the
canopy than to have it drag a chunk of concrete (or whatever) over your
bus!
