I wouldn't consider myself organized in any way, shape or form.  The small
amount of organizational tendencies I display are purely coincidental.  For
instance, I was forced to box up all the parts from the '54 because I was
*losing* stuff; for example: I somehow misplaced the passenger footrest,
and the grab bar for behind the front seat.

&gt;this is exactly why (other than being single) Thom gets his projects 
&gt;finished quickly. I always figured he was neat and organized 
&gt;(sometimes you get that &quot;vibe&quot; from his posts). It looks like that's 
&gt;definatly the case.
