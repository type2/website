The best thing to do when a person screws up is to admit it. I SCREWED UP!
but it was never my intention to cast dispersions on Ron, the BD, or his
generous offer. ...
First, a very public apology for statements that were not meant at all the
way they sounded. Ron, I never meant my post to be an attack or defamatory
to you or your generous offer.

In order to explain what I was trying to do with &quot;the post from hell&quot; I
offer the following:
&quot;He's got to be kidding - thought I would send this for your information
before I tell him no.&quot; Here is where I screwed up.... There should have been
a :) after the period. I meant it as I was surprised and happy, as in saying
&quot;wow, would he really do that&quot; after reading such a generous offer. I put
the &quot;no&quot; part in to get the lists reaction.

My intent was to throw this important financial decision to the list and the
admin's at the same time. Over the years I have been on the list, there has
been a lot of talk about who makes policy, etc. In financial matters, I
believe it is important to be open and above board. That is why I was asking
the list. I screwed up again by NOT posting it to the Type2 list.

So, Ron , if you can accept a very public and humble apology, and if the
list can forgive me for a stupid, stupid way of expressing myself, we will
get back to VW's.

Please direct any reply aimed at my stupidity to me...

If any of you think this is a good idea, please let me know.

I will take all replies and follow the consensus of opinion
(I have delayed posting this to the Type2 list, at least until I re-word
it!!!!!!)
