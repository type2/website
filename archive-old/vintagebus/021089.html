Subject: Friday Detour..&quot;Then Came Bronson&quot;

Hi Real Bus People  I guess some of the &quot;Old&quot; dudes on
here will remember that old show from 1969 &quot;Then came
Bronson&quot;...What you dont! Say you were at Woodstock
rolling in the mud with flowers in your hair? Well
great because I wanted to be there but the east coast
is a long drive for a 16 year old without a car on the
west coast sooooo... I watched Bronson.Well anyways
what could be better than Bronson on his Harley
splitting bumper to bumper traffic with a splittie?
Yep...I know..Hippie chicks! well... I bought this
small poster last weekend and there it is....Some dude
sitting in his splittie in that traffic jam about 3
cars back with a suit on and white shirt with a red
tie and he tops it off with a hat! Hahahahahaha Man
are those days gone? Nope you say....Thats the way you
drive to work in your splittie....ahhhh... sorry Bus
Bro..ahhh ......Later.....
