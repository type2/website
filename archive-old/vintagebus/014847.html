I've had this problem before, and I'm not sure there's an easy solution.

When I got my '56, the engine oil was the nastiest I'd ever seen.
I changed it, warmed the engine up, changed it again.  I repeated
this about 5 times!  The oil was still coing out black.  I even

There are various engine cleaners you can run inside the crankcase.
I don't know how effective they are - I tried a can of some stuff and it
didn't do much for me.
