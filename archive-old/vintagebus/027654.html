&gt; That bus belongs to a friend here in town.  He lives just a few blocks
&gt; down from me.  He has had that bus since 1966 and put MANY miles on it

Pictures of this bus can be had from our Buskatiers archives which are free
for the taking.  They are photos I took and then a couple that Jamie Rivers
took of me starting this bus with the rope start from a snow mobile.  Worked
great!  Enjoy the photos at http://204.26.80.78:8084/nq/nq2/catalog6.html
