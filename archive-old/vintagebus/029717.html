&gt;When issssaha first bought that seat I offered him 450$ (based on what
previous DD seats had sold for, I'm sure deasterwood would agree that that
is 
the &quot;going rate&quot;). I mean, DD busses are cool and all but, who wants them?
&gt;
Nice try.

I think the problem is not with him wanting $3k for it, it's the games he
is playing.  First it's for trade only, then he says it's sold/traded, then
it's up for sale for money on eBay, now it's traded for who knows and who
cares what.

If you want $3k for something, just ask it.  I can respect that, at least
we can just say &quot;$3000 is insane, go to hell&quot; like all the &gt;$25,000 &quot;restored&quot;
Buses.

FWIW, it looks like everyone who bid over $1000 on the seat was just playing
around, I know I was.

And I thought the guy asking $1500 for a Barndoor middle seat was crazy...
