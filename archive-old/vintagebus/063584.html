Subject: Re: [VB] 67 bug to bus tranny swap

Hi Mark,
You really need to find out the R&amp;P and at least fourth gear ratio to know 
how fast you can cruise.  Then the first through third gear ratios to make 
sure thier is no huge RPM gap between any of the gears.  
  The bus and KG use a .821 fourth gear, the bug used a .89 fourth gear.  
This results in a 5MPH slower cruising tranny in the bug than the KG doing 65 
MPH _at_ 3,000 RPM.  Due to the RGBs of the bus this means a really slow bus.  
If you decide to just try it make sure to flip the ring gear of the R&amp;P or 
have four reverse and only one forward gears!
