Subject: Re: [VB] not a public debate room!!!!!

I think that by not going to a show you show that, not
only you are you die hard, but you have a voice that
counts and will be heard. If they sell even one car we
still lose, right? If the show was moved or resheduled
wouldn't the charities still benefit? The real winners
should be the people who came to the show to enjoy
their hobby, especially those who want to keep it
going. 
I guess we will just have to agree to disagree.

&gt; See on this show  volkswagen stands to gain very
&gt; little.  Yeah it may sell a 
&gt; few cars to lookers, but the real winners are the
&gt; charities and show 
&gt; promoters.  They are just using the companies
&gt; grounds.  And what better way 
&gt; to start getting the message out but to let them
&gt; know how die hard we are and 
&gt; that we are here to stay and willing to work with
&gt; them to make it happen.  
&gt; Crashing a show like this would just unleash another
&gt; pack of dogs that I 
&gt; don't think many of us want to see..
