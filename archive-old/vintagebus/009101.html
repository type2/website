Subject: Re: [VB] A new term - 'ROS'
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;



&gt;IMHO, &quot;ROS&quot; should only apply to an NOS piece that has been damaged in some
&gt;way and then restored to it's previous NOS condition.  That ribbed bumper
&gt;was not NOS before straightening and thus the term does not apply


haha if it was NOS before straightening, why would it even need to be
straightened? Doesnt NOS mean NEW old stock?.....er nevermind, i dont wanna
get on *that* discussion again. But  I dunno if i'd call it straightened,
unless of course you mean it was straightened to the point that the bumper
shop took the factory arch in the center almost completely out of it? but of
course they said they had truck ribbed bumper patterns! lol  ah yes, thats
right. Funny part is, i actually almost had 800 bucks into that bumper after
the purchase and the straightening, yet i ripped it off as soon as i found a
NOS one. Tell boeckel i get a cut of that money if he actually gets that
much since i took such a loss when i sold it to greg =)You can read all
about it on my site under my 57 single cab restoration. Even tho i had that
story on there, Everett took his bumper 'straight' to that shop (no pun
intended)....some peoples kids.
