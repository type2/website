I was at my local VW shop this morning and asked the owner where I could get
some high zinc content primer, He showed me a can of rustolium that he says
is loaded with the stuff. I can get it at the local Lowes.  I think that I
will load up with the stuff and re do my insides.

&gt;&gt; Hi Cal,
&gt;&gt; The problem again is that there is no primer or paint under those
&gt;supports
&gt;&gt; that are welded to keep the sheet metal from flexing.  Unlike the type
&gt;1s that
&gt;&gt; were dipped completely in a high zinc content primer the buses were
&gt;sprayed
&gt;&gt; primered.  Resulting in bare sheet metal under those welded supports.
&gt;Now the
&gt;&gt; POR15 by itself probably will not do anything bad by itself, but once
&gt;you
&gt;&gt; installed the insulation you made your mistake.  Since most insulation
&gt;is
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Hi Eric and Barb,
&gt;
&gt;I made sure that the POR was sprayed into the braces as well as possible.
&gt;Also, For the first 21 yrs of ownership, when I was young and niave, I
&gt;just threw R14 pillows in there. When 21 yrs later I took everything out,
&gt;there was no sign of rust at all anywhere - and this car had been
&gt;everywhere!  And always stored outside too.
&gt;
&gt; Go figure!
