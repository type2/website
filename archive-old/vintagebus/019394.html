a certain infamous soto boy i *heard* had one- basically a big metal box - i
think it was more for a more permanent means of storgae than a camper thingie

m.

&lt;&lt;does any one make or did make a slide in camper for a single cab?

Thanks,

Kevin Sullivan&gt;&gt;

I have heard of two metal shells that exist for single cabs that are 
SUPPOSEDLY an option/accessory deal but do not think they were intended for 
camping.  Im trying to find the pics.
