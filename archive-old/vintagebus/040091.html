I'm not sure on the sizes of these screws, but I can almost guarantee you 
that you're not going to find them in town.  I've look at five or six 
different hardware stores for those babies and I couldn't find them.  BUT, 
head over to wolfsburgwest_dot_com and I think you'll find them there.  Bout .20 
a piece.
