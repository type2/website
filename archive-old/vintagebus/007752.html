you mean the outer part of the gen pulley?  Or the inner half?  Or is the
nut stuck?
&gt;
Thanks for the suggestions, got it off right after I sent the note, of
course.  Liquid Wrench did it's job...

It was the big 'ol 36hp nut itself.
Yes, I was turning the right way.  :p
My wife/friend was using a 3' breaker bar as I held the screw driver.


Thanks,
