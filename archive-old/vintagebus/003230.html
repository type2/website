&gt;I am a bit confused,  Bill said he used Laundry soda (I guess this is
&gt;laundry detergent) and you said you used salt.  Did you use salt and
&gt;laundry detergent?


Several people have emailed me about this &quot;discrepency&quot; in the recipe.  The
salt was my own addition because it does increase conductivity which is the
key to this whole electrolysis bit.   Since this whole thing was an
experiment to me, I figured a little dash of salt (in addition to the
laundry detergent - I used some regular powdered laundry soap) for good luck
wouldn't hurt.  I can't say that I was anything less than pleased with the
results!
