Subject: interesting?

I found this kind of interesting while browsing through an old VW dealer
book the other day.  A lot of people (from what I understand) think that
the truck style mirrors on splits were aftermarket and slapped on there
by one of the previous owners.  Not true in all cases.  The larger truck
style mirrors were an option and they are part # or option #
ZVW-151-203
They were 5&quot;X10&quot; and chrome.

so....if anyone has any of those laying around....I may want to take
them off your hands as AFAIK my bus (63) came with them from the holes
that were drilled etc.  Far too good of an installation to be amatuer I
think....but hey...they might have been aftermarket on mine.

Either way...just an interesting tidbit of info that you may or may not
already know...
