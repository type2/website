&lt;&lt;  1.      The Workshop manual says to renew both paper seals (the one 
between the red. box housing and the brake backing plate as well as the one 
between the backing plate and the bearing cover.  They mention nothing about 
using sealant.  Should I use something like the brush-on liquid &quot;Permatex 
Form-a-gasket sealant&quot; or &quot;Gasketsinch&quot; sealant on both sides of each gasket, 
or put the gaskets in dry?  Knowledgeable opinions?&gt;&gt;
We never have, and no leaks after all the repairs and years there.
 
&lt;&lt;2.      When re-installing red. box drain (I used &quot;magnetic&quot;) plugs, after 
cleaning the threads very thoroughly, should a dab of the above mentioned 
sealant be used or not used on the threads before installing to help prevent 
leaks?  Anyone know of a torque spec for these plugs?  I didn't see one.  I 
know not to over tighten them.  And yes I have been, and will be
 using GL-4 tranny gear oil. &gt;&gt;
Do not use sealant there!  MKG 2.0 or 14 Ft. Lbs.
 
 &lt;&lt;3.      The Workshop manual says to use a little &quot;hi-melting point graphite
 grease&quot; on the brake adjusting stars for lubrication when re-assembling
 them in their housing.  What is a modern-day brand and descriptive name for
 this grease?  If it's unusual stuff, where do you get it?&gt;&gt;
We have just used old used stuff from the front axle grease sessions.  
Graphite mixed would be a very good idea!  That way when the grease dies the 
graphite goes on and on since it is a dry lubricant.
 
 &lt;&lt;4.      Am I correct in assuming that the only parts used out of the 
generic rear axle seal kits when used on a 1964-'67 &quot;big nut&quot; Bus tranny are 
the two paper gaskets, the smaller &quot;O&quot; ring, the cotter pin and the axle 
grease seal (I used Ronnie's German seal instead of the one included in the 
kit).  The larger &quot;O&quot; ring and the large flat, thin washer included in the 
kit can be saved or discarded. Does that sound correct?&gt;&gt;
Correct!  The washer is for pre-early 1964 and the large O-ring is for type 3.
 
&lt;&lt;5.       Finally, do any of you experts out there have any wonderful tips
 to share concerning these procedures (bearing seal replacement and rear
 brake replacement)?&gt;&gt;
Mainly when you install the outer bearing cover with the new axle seal 
pressed in it, it is a good idea to have the steel spacer/seal race seated 
inside the axle seal.
