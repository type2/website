&lt;&lt; If you pull the starter, put it on a bench, and power it with a
 battery charger, what happens? &gt;&gt;
Hi Dworkin,
Most chargers do not have enough amperage to kick a starter over.  We use a 
spare battery, jumper cables, and pin the starter to the floor with one foot 
when applying voltage!  Yee Ha!  Eric&amp;Barb
