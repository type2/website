I just posted that mine work well, but I will give you a rationalization as
to why they shouldnt.

It has to do with air flow. Any object moving along pushes air out of the
way as it moves. The bus pushes itself through the air displacing it and
creating vortexes and vacuums. This is recognized many times over through
the fact that exhaust gasses can actually find thier way back into the bus
through a leaky rear hatch, and &quot;drafting&quot; semis gives better gas mileage. 

Anyway, the bus pushes the air away from it as air hits the front. The air
then rushes back in to fill the gap (vacuum) towards the rear of the bus.
The air is actually pushed into the vents in the rear like this: (geez this
is hard to explain without graphics!) Air moves past the front, displaced to
each side. The vacuum (where the bus has been miliseconds ago) draws the air
back in at 25 to 75 degree angles (estimated for explanation purposes)
relative to the length (or longways position) of the bus, around the rear.
If a scoop is in place, it is actully capturing very little of that air,
because it is at the wrong angle (parallel to the length of the bus) and
blocking the swirling, returning air from entering the vents. Therefore
scoops have very little air to capture (they are ahead of and in the vaccum)
and wont work well.
Some of you will say &quot;But Jason, late model busses have scoops&quot;!
Sure they do, but they are mounted high and farther to the rear, especially
since they are longer.

I hope that explains the theory well enough.
