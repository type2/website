Subject: Electrical conversion

Hello all,
    Alrighty, getting ready to try an electrical overhaul on my '62
Kombi...tired old 6V bus...and I'm looking for a bit o' advice about the whole
thing.  What happened when you did this?  What did you wish you had but didn't
at the time?  I'm planning on sticking a voltage drop under the dash to handle
things like wiper motor and anything I can't afford to replace all at once.  Did
you experience any problems afterwards because of missed details?  I am planning
on getting one of those conversion kits...or does someone have a better idea?  

Would like to drop a bit of a brag and a little weirdness....the brag is
this...got this beautiful bus for just $875.00...runs strong, tranny is an oil
eater but more than functional, minimal rust...how many times does that happen?

Weirdness is this.._dot_came with two notable stickers...on rear hatch window &quot;Old
and in the Way&quot;....on driver's door glass &quot;Stoner Chicks Rule&quot;...yeah...
