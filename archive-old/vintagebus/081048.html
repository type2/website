Subject: Re: [VB]gasoline etc

&gt;  But what I said it there's not much difference in density
&gt;between -liquid- water at different temperatures.  (~1% if I 
&gt;remember right????)
&gt;That isn't comparing ice to water.



actually, i realized that was what you meant seconds after i hit 'send.'  :)

my truck-drivin' relative keith says that yes, gasoline DOES expand; 
he pointed out that when we drove two trucks out here for the move, 
he would remind me each fillup not to get it too full or it would 
pour out the vents.  FWIW.
