Subject: Need Westie Cabinet parts
Message-ID: &lt;3B33622B_at_webmail&gt;
Mime-Version: 1.0

Hi all:
I am searching for the drawer that goes at the top of the fridge/cooler 
cabinet in a '66/67 westie. Also, any extra cabinet handles correct for those 
years. Finally, both cushions and/or vinyl material (bottom and back support) 
for the 3/4 rear facing seat behind the driver in a bench seat westie.
Any leads greately appreciated. I have lots of parts to trade, or can pay if 
prefered.
Thanks
Cris
