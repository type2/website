I have what i consider and i think MOST all others will to a Full Metal Rack.
3 legs on each side. and guess what? i went and measured it for you!  its 112&quot;
long and 53&quot; wide and 15.5&quot; high. THESE ARE DEFENITLY APPX. do not go build
some thing with tubes and these measurements.   I love it!  I paid $450 local
for it. then another $250 to sand blast, primer, paint, and clear it. It has
the curved sides and flat front the most common style i have seen.  Have fun
and i know there are a few Volks out there with these racks.

All good girls need a Nice Rack!
