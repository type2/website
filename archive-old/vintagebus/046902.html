Puh-leese honey,
actually i was thinking about putting the starter on ebay....i can see it now &lt;RARE--NOS VW STARTER--BARNDOOR?&gt; no reserve , but a nice starting bid of $300
with lots of fuzzy pics....
oh yeah, jim....i've got a nice tight steering box and front end I can sell ya..trade you for a F-150 AC compressor, to top it off, i'll even up trade you a self-supporting starter for a ford back seat =)

still looking for those cardboard air vent scoops...since were on cardboard..check this out...might try on the bus

If Beto put that self supporting auto starter into the

Oh well I definitely am glad to be in JAFO mode for
the time being. I have to go check the A/C in the
F150. Actually the A/C in the Land Cruiser is colder.
