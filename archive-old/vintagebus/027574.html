&lt;&lt; at a recent show i saw a 67 westfalia, with a table behind the pasenger 
side seat with the clear holder for the aluminum glasses  , hinged on the 
back of the seat was a clear rectangled box that was hinged where it would 
cover the glasses, was this a accessory in the 60's or something that thet 
added on later? &gt;&gt;
Hi Paul,
Sounds like late 50s or early 60s SO-23 tumbler set that has been scavanged 
and screwed into a 67 Westie, or perhaps someone went the Westie factory and 
special ordered that piece installed in thier new 67 Westie.   Eric&amp;Barb
