Yes, I HAVE replaced the wire that goes up the column, AND put drinking
straws down its length :)
But the unwanted beeping has returned recently; I suspect a short in the
ignition switch (yes, redid the wiring and checked for fraying) or the
column shorting to ground... the columnlock mechanism perhaps??

Any clues? Ways to check for shorts to the column tube?
