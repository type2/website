Subject: VW community's loss

It is a sad day in Phoenix and the valley of the sun.  Butch Casdorph,
Presdent of SWATO, a NEATO chapter has died.  Don't know too many details, but
it seems he was flying a couple of passengers to Mexico City when their plane
went down.  There were no survivors.  So far, we don't know anything about the
cause of the crash.

Anyone who attended the last couple of Jerome Jamborees will undoubtedly
remember Butch as the guy on stage who helped Uncle Jerry Jess with the
announcing and the raffles.  In fact, he gave several flight certificates as
raffle prizes at last Jerome Jamboree.

Those who knew Butch, knew him as a smart, innovative, and detail-driven bus
driver, with a cool metalic green, early bay single cab, among other VW's.
Butch will most definitely be missed..........

Jon Stanton
Pres. ABC

PS:  Could someone please fwd this to the Type 2 list for me.  Thanks.
