Subject: How loud is to loud?
Message-ID: &lt;5858b754.246a4944_at_aol_dot_com&gt;

Dear list:
I have just finished my 66 deluxe (YAY) 	went for our first ride
Monday it was kinda noisy (I have a 76 westy that's real quite). Not having
driven a spit in 30 years maybe I forgot how loud they are? Today I changed
the trans oil and the oil in the redux box's, changed a front wheel bearing
and repacked they other. It was a bit quieter but still noisy.  I could not
trace the noise to any one area, only that its coming from the back of the
bus. Is this Normal?
