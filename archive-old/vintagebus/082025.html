Subject: what thickness Shims to use?

Hello Bus People:
I am having my heads rebuilt for my wife's 79 bus. It's a 2.0 liter fuel 
injection engine. The shop is welding small cracks and resetting the valve 
seats. They said after they do their work the seats will not come loose. We'll 
see about that! They recommend that I lower the compression ratio to prevent 
the cracking. My cylinders already have 0.030&quot; shims each at the top and 
bottom.

They say I should add 0.020&quot;. So my strategy is to replace the top shim with a 
0.050&quot; shim and just retain the bottom one so I wouldn't have to pull the 
cylinder off the piston and rings. The engine doesn't burn any oil. The only 
problem was that the valve seats shifted causing a loss of compression in 1 
cylinder. The engine had only 30,000 miles since it was rebuilt. I know this 
will lower the horsepower but to me it would be worth it if it makes the 
engine last longer. What do you think about this plan? Any thing else I should 
consider?

Thanks in advance for your opinions.

Dave
