Hi P&amp;C,
The 6 to 12 volt inverters are for low amperage use.  Think about  5 amps or 
less.  Even if you only wanted 1 amp of power at 110 you are  going to need 
9.17 amp _at_ 12 volts, and that is not taking in account for  the draw of the 12 
to 110 AC inverter.  The 12 volt to 110 AC  inverter is going to be way too 
much for the 6 to 12  volt inverter.
  Plus there is always going to be that temptation to plug in some  other 
higher amp use item into the 12 to 110 Ac inverter........
