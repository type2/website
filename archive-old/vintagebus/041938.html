&gt; Hi Folks,
&gt; I'm listing an bus item on E-bay and have set a reserve.  I keep getting
&gt; messages from perspective bidders asking my reserve.  Is this common
&gt; practice?  Should I disclose this information.  After the $3000 middle
&gt; seat episode, I'm wearing my flame retarding suit ;0)

The reserve allows you to put an item up for auction without risking the
sale of the item for a &quot;fire-sale&quot; price if the auction does not prove
popular.  If you disclose the reserve, you run the risk of having someone
immediately bid that amount, stifling other bids due to the big jump.

Others seem to use a high reserve to save paying ebay a commission on the
sale.  They will still sell to the high bidder, but the transaction is
outside of the ebay system.

As with any system, people will figure out a way to manipulate it to their
advantage.  Most of the people who use ebay are honest, but enough are
dishonest to cause me to avoid ebay.  Being stung once is enough for me!
