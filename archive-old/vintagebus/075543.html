Subject: Re: Parcel tray full of water and dodgy speedo backlights

&gt;The fuel gauge light works fine, and if I remove one of the bulb holders
&gt;from the speedo and earth it separately it works fine - therefore I must
&gt;have an earthing problem.

Sounds reasonable.  One further check is to see if your high beam pilot
light has the same problem, as it is also earthed to the speedo.

When you pull the backlight bulb holder out of the speedo, does it come
out easily or does it require a little force?  If it comes out easily,
you might try *gently* squeezing down the tube on the speedo that the
bulb holder slides into with a pair of pliers.  Is the outside of the bulb
holder corroded?  Maybe polish it (and the inside tube on the speedo) with
some fine sandpaper.

&gt;Thing is I don't know where the speedo should be earthed - is it just
&gt;through the two mounting screws?

Yes.  Even on later Buses that had earth wires for the outside lights
and other equipment, the speedo didn't get its own earth wire.  Later
Bugs even have a terminal under one of the mounting screws for the
earth wires from other equipment.

&gt;If so I guess these need replacing - is it possible to remove these
&gt;without removing the dash tray?

I don't know.  You can twist your hand around and touch them - if
they're loose, you might have found the problem.  Maybe put a toothed
washer under one of them before tightening it back down, to further
improve the connection.
