&gt; Some time back, someone on this site suggested J-B welding a nut to the back

Better yet, glue the bolt in, so you just have to spin on the nut from the
engine compartment. You use the nifty Sears 17mm ratcheting flat box
wrench ($12) that makes it childs play. And you don't have to get under
the bus and reach up into the black greasy void.
