with all that * money * let's hope they train better
submarine pilots than the US Navy.
It looks like the USN is so strapped
that they have to borrow civilian crewmen
to man their defense against the malevolent
Japanese fishermen. Or do you guys watch the news?
No really,-
This all smacks of xenophobia.
Japan has been in recession for years.
The omniscient Hawaiian state government has
seen fit to put all its eggs in one basket
and back the tourist trade with
there land use and fiscal policy
One third of those tourists * were * Japanese.

  **********************************
Now with the US mainland in a slow down,
the little old ladies who save their pennies
and dream if some day going  to Waikiki are
paying for their fuel oil with them.
If the US Military pulls out, the Hawaiians
can go back to poi patches and fishing.
That's my prognostication,
move over Nostradomis.

************************************

I have to ask this...
Are  we raping each other for parts and
blaming the japanese or
trailer queens or what ever?
What have we learned w/ ebay?
Do you drive your bus?
Have you sighed the pre 1963 Bentley crusade page?
Are you Born Again?

Aloha.
Ken

PS
If there are any Japanese bus people lurking
on this list I'd love to hear from you and apologize
for the idiocy of the last few days.
Flame shields up!
