Hi All,

I got a bunch of stuff back from the chrome shop last week so I made some
great progress on the 59 double cab.

- pre fit Porsche 356B brakes and found out the wheels I wanted to run are
too wide and several other sets won't fit the brakes.  So it's back to the
drawing board as to which rims to use.

- Re-assembled ATE steering box and mounted it up along with a NOS steering
column seal (yes, I did find one!)

- Put horn back together and mounted it.

- Mounted fuse box

- tightened front tranny mount and brake line hardware in engine
compartment.  Cleaned flexible clutch cable tube.  Put on the rear shift rod
boot I got from Rob King in Australia.  I'm almost ready to mount the
tranny!  Now all I need is the other shift rod boot and I can finish up the
shift mechanism.


Now, due to the wheel issue, I have a strange thought in my mind... I'll let
it stew for a while before I let it out but I would like to ask around for
any one that has an old worn out set of shocks from their bus.  They should
have 'Fichtel &amp; Sachs' written on them with a part number 111-513-031F or
211-513-031F (I'll accept the E designated shocks as well).  Again, I only
care if the bodies are in good shape and don't care if they are completely
worn out and the rubber bushings are shot.  So how 'bout it???


TIA

David
