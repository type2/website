Friday 13th Burger Meet at University Burger master    5pm-9pm

Sat July 14th - 20th Annual Vintage Meet-
               at Shoreline Community College

these are put on by the Cascade Kombis- for  more info  call Kenny at 206-
523-6525 or kenm_at_thebusco_dot_com


Usually SIR has the bug races and swap the next day, which is put on my a
different group.   There is always a Bremerton bug drag and swap, and I
dunno
why they scheduled it the same Sat as vintage meet, but there is it, - but
realise it is not neccessarily wholey the same crowd at vintage or at SIR-
so
no big deal.  There is a pretty active drag race scene in the PNW, loads of
it.
