Looking for a HUMAN translator.  I'm sure there are words in German like the 
English &quot;wind&quot; which have dual meanings - &quot;The cold north wind&quot; or &quot;Wind a 
clock&quot;  Hoping to find someone to convert the articles into English.  None of 
the articles are very long.

&lt;&lt; Here's two on line german to english translators.
