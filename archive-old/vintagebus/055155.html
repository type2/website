&gt;Is the sunroof Barndoor Kombi that's for sale on TheSamba as special as
the guy thinks? I over heard him talking about it at a show this past wee=
kend.
He seems to think it's gold. Considering all it's missing is $4000 anythi=

but outrageous? or are pre 55  type 2's that much more valuable that post=

55?
&gt;
It's gold.  I'd like to own it but $4000 is too much for me, IMHO, based
on all the welding and repair work and expen$ive missing parts that it lo=
oks
like it needs.  Judging by his description and the photos, it looks MUCH
worse (to me) than the ad leads you to believe.  Of course, I haven't see=
n
it in person.

It's a Standard, not a Kombi.  If it was a Kombi...  ;)
