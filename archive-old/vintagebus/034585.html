&lt;&lt;  Big nut tranny in a early bus is not correct either, but you aren't
 complaining! Do what you want, to your bus, but be responsible! Stock is
 stock!!&gt;&gt;
   Hi Mike,
We do not mind those who want to modify there VWs.  Just we hate to see those
who modify badly and set the VW to fall apart or explode soon and this type of
stuff either wrecks the VW or sets another possible VW owner to say that VWs
are junk due to these changes a PO or themselfs made.  When it was just that
they did not know the consiquences of what they were doing to there VWs that
caused the problems.  We changed our compleate suspension to 1964-67 on our
1960 to get 2MPH faster in fourth and get 20% bigger brakes that feel like
50%bigger!  Since this system was used on stock VWs it has been proven to be a
great modification by the miles on those buses.
&lt;&lt;Eric and Barb, when you put those big tires on your bus, didn't you have to
 cut your wheel wells? &gt;&gt;
  Our 1960 came with the wheel wells cut out and we have already replaced one
back in and are going to replace the other.  Then we will change from a
215/75R15 (27&quot;) to a slightly smaller P205/75R15 that fit in 1962 and earlier
bus rear wheel wells.  The original tires used on the 1955-63 buses were about
27&quot; in dia. so the P215/75R15s are as close as you can get in radial.  Both of
these sized tires are alot smaller than the LT235/75R15s (29&quot; which actually
fit in 1963 and later rear wheel wells.) we use to use acouple of years ago
that were much larger than the tires we are now using and will use in the
future in our pre-1963 buses.         Eric &amp; Barb
