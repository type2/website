Subject: 65 trans back together (fulcrum plate saga)
Content-type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII

Well,  Todd had come out yesterday and checked the differential, just in case
it wasn't the fulcrum plates, and said that was all fine.  Today  after the
transaxle was all together with RGboxes (the fulcrum plates are all later
rockable style), I took a break today to get something to eat.   Saw that old
VW Trends and flipped to an ad I saw that seemed hopeful- guy advertised he
did full crash and split case trannies.  He actually answered the phone- and
knew what I was talking about when I mention early and late fulcrum plates!!!!
I said I had driven my 65 bus 150 miles, there was a wierd noise, pulled it
apart and it had mismatched fulcrum plates that were being munched.  He was
surprised I got 150 miles out of it!    He said you shouldn't mismatch them.
Yup, it seems that way.  And would it cause that noise?   He actually at one
time had the same noise happen to him, though he described it as a 'clicking',
he pulled it apart and found the same story with mismatched FPs which were
chewing each other up, and when he sorted that out, the noise went away.
This was great news and confirmation, I thanked him profusely, and went back
to work.

Also replaced the Flywheel O ring, which was well worn, cleaned up the clutch
and where oil had dripped, and put it together.  Hey dufous, gotta do both,
not just the main seal.

I had hung the tranny and had the wheels one, and it was getting late.   Well,
I'll just get the tranny all hooked up.    Okay, brakes are altogether, hm...
the wheels spin a bit different than before when I turned it to adjust the
brakes,  and sound slightly different.  Bled the brakes, attached things, and
the last thing I attached was the square screw for the shift linkage.  I
suddenly felt reall good.   I tightened it, put the wire in, and got out from
under the bus, and cranked the tunes and danced around.   Then I tightened
down all the bolts appropriately (except the 2 27mm bolts, which I spaced.    

 Think I'll just hang the motor.  Okay, motor in, gas hooked up, accelerator
cable in place.   Oops, forgot the 27mm bolts, managed to torque them from
underneath.     Well, let's hook up the electrics, replace the ground strap to
the battery, hang the aprom, etc.  Well, the motors in, go for a test drive.
Open the garage door and  Oh- adjust clutch cable.   Okay-  won't start- oh
center wire fell off the coil, attach it.   Vroom!     Pull it out, pulled the
garage door closed and let it warm up while I washed my hands.   

I drive around for about ten minutes, and I don't hear that rythmic clunking
noise anymore.   Pretty cool, huh?

Guess I'll hook up the heat and hang the rear bumer tomorrow, and take it to
the tire place to get them to find why the right front tire was going flat.

That's all

Clara
