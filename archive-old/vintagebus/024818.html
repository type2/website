Not necessarily!  If it just barely flickers at idle you should be ok. 
That's the engine speed where your generator output just about matches
the voltage of your battery.  This is a good idle speed actually.  You
still have oil pressure, the synchros in your transmission don't work
too hard to get it in gear, and you don't waste a lot of fuel idling at
a higher speed.

It's also how I set the idle on my old BMW motorcycles.
