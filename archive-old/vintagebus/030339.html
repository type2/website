Subject: westy question

A freind of mine has just ran into a westy for sale. It is a 74 and this
probably is not the place to ask, but I am not on the bay window list
and there seems to be a lot of people here that have multiple westys. I
wanted to know how many westys in 74 came with air conditioning. He only
wants $350 for it. Needs brakes, but runs. Paint and seat covers in the
front are pretty rough. No rust , not even in the battery area, but a
football sized dent around the other side tail light. I have heard that
this might be a better bus than my 65 for cross country trips, but I
have heard something about the type 4 motor dropping valve seats. I had
a 914 but never experienced this. Things like the disk brakes, larger
bed, AC, higher gearing , and the double bed on top sound pretty nice.
Dropped valve seats, expensive motor parts, and smog checks don't sound
that good. If the AC is kind of rare it might make it more of a find.
either way it is kind of cool with the condenser bolted to the bottom of
the bus. Any info would be great. I have not even ever driven a bay
window, only my splitty and a vanagon.
