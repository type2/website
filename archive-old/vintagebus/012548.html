Hi All-

I am trying to clean up my garage a bit and might be ridding myself of a few
bus related items I am not using.

Does anyone have an interest in the aluminum rail that pop rivets to your rain
gutter and is/was used on 65-&gt;67 westy's to attach your tent to.

I assume I am preaching to the converted and don't have to get into much
further info. P-mail me if you are interested and we can talk $hop.

Michael
