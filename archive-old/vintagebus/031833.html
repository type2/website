Subject: IT Run's (60 Westy)

Being I have to return the car trailer to it's real owner (I store it for
free for it's use) for a while, I decided I'd try to get the 60 Westy
running and driving before I unloaded it off the trailer at my house instead
of the shop (that would mean repairs). I got in the bus and turned the
ignition key, it didn't turn, Damn it I thought to myself. I was so proud of
the fact that I was given all the keys to the bus and assumed that they all
did work in they're respective slots. Again I removed and re-inserted the
key, a turn to the right and IT WORKED, I didn't have it in all the way the
first try. So far so good, key turns but no nothing. I was told upon
purchase that this was a Running bus. 
  So I got out of the bus and walked around to the back to inspect the
engine, took the trusty Church key out of my pocket (those that know me know
I always have a church-key in my pocket) opened the engine lid and there it
was AN ENGINE, fuel line, wires, air cleaner etc. all there and connected,
looked to the right and found my problem NO BATTERY, I walked over to my
wife's bug (just brought it home for her after refurbishing) and took out
the new battery I just bought at Wally World for it and installed it in the
bus.  Again I turned on the key and I had dash lights, continued the turning
motion, the spring load against my fingers, all the way till it stopped,
NOTHING. Now what I thought to myself, is the ignition bad. Is there even a
starter? So I tried again and again, then finally the starter moved, turning
freely with the correct sound and speed. So far so good. Went back to look
at the engine, fuel in the filter, CHECK. Hot at the coil, CHECK. Guess I
better check to see if there is any oil, again CHECK.
Went back and took my position again behind the well, turned the key, dash
lights CHECK, engine turning over CHECK, pumped the gas pedal feverishly
while the engine was turning over, OIL light went out, engine still
cranking, pumping gas like a madman at a AC/DC concert and VEROOOOOM she
started, white smoke billowing like someone filled the carb with oil, but
then it went away as she warmed up she started to want to idle, no more
smoke, engine starting to purr like a kitten THEN. I pressed on the brake
pedal, IT WORKED, a couple pumps and it was nice and firm. Looks like I got
brakes. Pressed in the clutch pedal, nice and smooth, no weird noises, must
be ok. Then I proceeded to try the gears, reverse lunged then nothing, !st
gear lunged then nothing, 2nd, 3rd 4th all the same WTF. Turned the bus off
wondering what was wrong then I realized that it was still tied down on the
trailer,Dooooh. Tomorrow I will hook the trailer to my Fo#d and unload the
bus and take it for a spin. Now I just need to do the body work and another
early Westy will be on the road again.
