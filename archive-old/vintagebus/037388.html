&lt;&lt; Basically any bus that came with laminated glass (I believe only U.S. 
export) 
 from 56- ~~64 Came with this style latch.
 The glass companies couldnt drill holes through laminated glass so this 
style 
 slider was introduced.
 My 57 has them.
 My 58 singlecab did not.
 My 58 sunroof standard did!
 My 59 singlecab did not!
 My 61 deluxe did!
 My 63 deluxe did!
 My 64 standard did not!
 Go figure!
 Most people swap them out for the non laminated style because the felt 
 channels are more readily available.
 
 My *guess* is that the D.O.T. (Dept. Of Transportation) required &quot;AS-1&quot; 
glass 
 in passenger vehicles from 57-on and since sekurit was producing AS-2 (Not 
 quite as clear) from 57-62 then the passenger cars used the laminated stuff. 
 In 63, maybe sekurit intorduces as1 glass and then all the busses adopted it?
 I could be wrong, feel free to correct me.
 That made no sense to anyone but me.

It seemed to me that all buses had them 61 through 63, and occasionally 
earlier, but I have seen many 60 and earliers w/ sekurit, and only a couple 
with sigla.  Having all sigla or all sekurit side glass is listed in the list 
of M codes.

Of course, you often find some sekurit glass on a sigla glass bus cause it 
can be easy to break that siglas stuff.  I broke a wing window on a friends 
bus,  I just pushed on the glass to open it, didn't hit hard or anything.  
crack!!! boy did I feel like a winner.  It got a sekurit glass and I oiled 
the hinges which hadn't been oiled in probably 30 years.
