Hello Everyone,
This past weekend I found another butterscotch plaid front curtain from a 71 
westy.  I am going to use to make the front sliding curtains for my 67 
westy.  I have the tracks intact but I don't have the sliders to attach to 
the curtains.  Are these available anywhere? Someone suggested the local RV 
supplier, but I don't know what the original looked like.  Any help would be 
appreciated.

67 Westy (almost finished)
62 camper (almost dead)
63 deluxe (someday)
69 Westy  (driving me crazy)
74 beetle (I have no Idea why it's in the yard)
