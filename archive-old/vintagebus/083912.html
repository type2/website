Subject: Re: [VB] dumb question: is there an &quot;easy&quot; way to lower  
  compression?

  Bill Fisher metions them in the How to Hot Rod your VW book as well. I plan on having some 1mm ones made when I put my 40 horse together. 69X83 so i can keep the compression down.

Hi Eric,
Any time you increase the number of sealing seams one increases the chance 
of failure. Most of the ones we have seen were made of aluminum. We do 
wonder how much the copper deforms. Having found one engine with pure copper 
instead of the copper plated steel washers used on the sump plate. The pure 
copper washers got a lot thinner and spread out so much as to lock onto the sump 
studs.
