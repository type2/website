Hey Thom

I hear ya dude.  Just I few years ago I decided: &quot;hey, won't I be
'cool/smart/tough' if i buy myself one of those thar' vw buses.&quot;  The SO
said: &quot;What, you fool, by the time you are finished fixing that thing you'd
have paid for a new vehicle.&quot;  I said: &quot;OK, maybe your right - but at least
this way I get to cheat the system.&quot;

So, I currently spend almost ALL of my free time fixing things that many
others would replace :).  Recently it was a dinky little headlight switch,
cool as hell fixin that.  Hey talk about neat - I rekeyed my locks, sure I
could have had it done for a very low price but I did get a lot of enjoyment
out of figuring how locks work (not to mention the opportunity to stick my
chest out and show the SO how handy I am.)  Next i'll be taking apart my
wiper motor - yahooooooooooo!.
