&gt; 
&gt; Ah, my bumpers are missing.

......Yeah if you have 2 front hoops, you wouldn't have the bumpers, but
they are missing on  alot of rear hoops too-see Dropgates for pics of
bumpers, etc. The hoops will deflect sideways in a crosswind, &amp; the bumpers
keep them in place by pressing against the side gates &amp; not marring the
paint on the gate/hoop.


 I have the curved strap - do you not
&gt; use it on a DC? 

DC's didn't use them, but you're right they wouldn't hurt.

 I don't see how it can hurt.
&gt; 
&gt; Any sources for wood?

Any good hardwood lumber supplier should be able to sell you enough white
oak($30+-)to make the 6 slats-again see dropgates for details.  Also see
archives for mucho threads on these, etc.
&gt; 
&gt;&gt;&gt; The question, however, is with the front hoop; is there a SC/DC
&gt;&gt;&gt; difference?  When I tried to bolt up the front hoop, there's a
&gt;&gt;&gt; 'rib' that prevents the bottom holes from lining up.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Not sure what you mean by rib-is it on the hoop or the truck? Pic?
&gt; 
&gt; It's on the bed.  My friend's single cab has it too.

All the SC/Dc's I have seen are the same, except for Binz's.  Still not sure
what rib you are referring to.
&gt; 
&gt;&gt; The slotted bracket should be flush +- to the front of the truck bed. Have
&gt;&gt; you got the hoop turned around?
&gt; 
&gt; Nope, this bolted down just fine.  Maybe these hoops are for a later bus?

Hmmmm? not sure of any bed/hoop differences in later model buses, but a
client sent me an og 79 DC canvas &amp; I threw it on my 63 DC &amp; it fit perfect.
