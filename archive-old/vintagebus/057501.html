&gt;  If you run a 74X88 the reason for the end castings is because you have

&gt; inch cylinder shims to keep the compression ratio betwee 6.8 to 1 up to 7.0
&gt; to 1.  I have designed and started and stopped (due to time) developing a
&gt; stock style muffler that will work on bigger engines. In the old 356 days we
&gt; made a few of these mufflers (Carrera style) to use on the big bore engines.
&gt; I am applying the same principles to the bus muffler. A little loader but
&gt; should flow beautiful.

I can see where this would be a problem.  With the engine wider you really
need a slip joint to make things line up.  I hate to see the simplicity
go, but without a custom fabricated manifold for each spacing you have to
have something to take up the slack.
