Didn't see the accident (left early to get back to Ottawa, Canada),

but did you see that wild paint job on that one split?  Guy said he had
over 400 hours in it.

I snapped some pics, I'll post them when I scan em.

My bus was the worse-for-wear one next to the 9000 mile, never restored,
looks like it came off the line bus.
