&lt;&lt;  I have been told that there should be no problem using these as long as I 
use the wheel bearings that are presently in use.  Perhaps someone on the 
list can verify/clarify this??? &gt;&gt;
Hi Jon,
No way!  You will have to replace everything.  You can not bolt the later 
wheel cylinders in due to needing to be farther outward due to larger 
diameter brake shoes/ brake drum!  The only thing you might be able to reuse 
is the beam itself, but you would have to remove the earlier bushings the 
trailing arms ride in, and install the later needle bearings.
