How old is your sender?   I had a similar thing happen a couple months ago 
with my 65 westy, and it turned out the sender was bad.  My old sender was 
dated 4/78,  I bought a new one dated 9/99, and the package said it was 
guananteed for 2 years, but not twenty -two years.

 I finally made it out to Bremerton, WA two months ago, but ended up with the 
 oil pressure dummy light coming on.  I hooked up VDO oil pressure &amp; temp. 
 guages, and found that after first starting up when cold, pressure is 40psi. 
   Once temp. reaches 120, pressure drops to less than 20psi when driving, 
 and a hare above 0psi when idling.  I checked the oil pump for wear, play in 
 the crankshaft for worn bearings, tried a thicker oil, cleaned the screen, 
 and checked for leaks.  None of these seems to be a problem.  Oil temp. 
 stabilizes at 180F.  Any ideas?  Happy driving--Chet
