CONFESSIONS OF A VIRGIN CAMPER
The MO-KAN Campout
by Kerry Murphy-Zimmerman (Rob's Friend)



    When you're a virgin, you don't have a clue.  Oh, you've seen it on =
TV,
read
about it and thought about it, but when it's time to do it, IT can be =
pretty
scary.  I was happy to have a more experienced partner to teach me the
wonderful world of camping.  Friday was tiring for me after the long =
drive
to Topeka (which translates to &quot;Bring More Deodorant Next Time&quot;).  The
caravan of Buskatiers including Rob and I, Bindy, Shelby, Shawn, Matt,
Daisy, Terry and Justin stopped on the way to help a stranded Harley.  =
Terry
says it's good Karma to help another air cooled vehicle.  Never really
thought about it, but it couldn't hurt!  I met many wonderful people on
Friday and was surprised to see so many camping and a great set up right =
by
the racetrack.  Justin and I went to the dirt track for awhile to get =
even
grittier than we already were and then it was time to sleep in a tent.  =
I
slept pretty well until the middle of the night when I awoke to some =
very
strange sounds 3 feet outside our tent.  The sounds reminded me of that
campfire scene from Blazing Saddles if you know what I mean.  Rob told =
me
who was sleeping there and I could barely contain my giggles.  I won't =
tell
you who it was (but he's 26 and his name rhymes with CAT). Rob had 2
sleeping bags with inflatable mattresses attached.  I thought that was
pretty cool until I woke up in the morning.  I informed him that I was
flat....and so was my mattress.  His, of course, was still fully =
inflated.

    Saturday was the show and flea market.  I was amazed at how many =
people
brought their cars to show.  It was really great fun.  Rick and Marty =
and
their crew did a wonderful job and I know they worked hard to set it up.
Rick has another virtue as I discovered on Friday.  He is THE SHOWER =
MAN!
Without him, I do believe that by Saturday night, I would have melted =
and
died like the wicked witch.  He set up the most incredible shower and =
was
kind enough to offer it's services to everyone.  I really should have =
kissed
him right then, but I controlled myself for once.  We also watched some
races on Saturday and that was also a good time.  By the time we got =
back to
the campsite, I was a big red lobster.  I got a good burn and I was =
getting
very very grumpy (as poor Rob can attest to).  We all went to eat at a =
yummy
barbeque place.  When we returned, I took a shower.  Wow, I felt like a
different person and I swear it wasn't just the cold beer.

    I would like to thank everyone I met for making my first time a =
success.
I'm still a little confused about your love for the VW's, but now I =
think of
VW owners like people who have old, slow, funny looking dogs.  =
Bystanders do
double takes, laugh or think &quot;yuck&quot;, why would anyone want one of those =
or
who in their right mind would have a dog painted like a cow?  But the =
owners
have a sense of humor like no other and will tell you about all the =
tricks
they can do and stories of all the places they've been together.  I =
found
out that it's not about the looks, but the spirit behind it that =
inspires
their owners. They go slower, smell the roses and laugh alot more.  =
Well,
because they have to.
