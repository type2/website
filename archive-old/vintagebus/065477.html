Subject: gas mileage

Hi Volks,

I saw a comparison chart last week someone on the list drew up comparing
chevy, ford, dodge and our beloved vw trucks.  one thing that lept out at me
was mpg listed as 29.  I get nowhere near that and was wondering about other
peoples mpg.  I run a 1600 dp with single solex carb and extrator exhaust
with single muffler.  I am getting 20 at best, and seem to be in the mid
teens currently.  What can be done to maximize mpg?

thanks!
Wes and 58sc
