My bro. had a bug once and this sound happened one day at the dunes. The 
thing ran fine and shifted fine, so he kept driving it and about an hour 
later the transmission locked up so bad the thing couldn't be towed. He ended 
up putting in a new tranny complete from hub to hub. All I remember about the 
tray is the inside where the clutch is, there was something making it's way 
out of the casing and straight towards the engine! He never opened it up to 
see what happened. So I guess I would have it checked out before you loose 
it! Now I wish he would have taken it apart to have a look see, but after the 
metal peeping out he didn't see much of a hope to finding out what started it!
