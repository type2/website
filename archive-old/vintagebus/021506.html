Hi,
It is always a good idea to check the voltage getting to the solinoid and if
it is lower than what the battery is putting out then finding where the
voltage is having problems getting through.  This is also true about any
electrical system in your VWslike head lights and tail lights should be check
every couple of years to clean and replace any parts that are causing
trouble.  We had the same problem that occured when our 1963 S. cab truck's
engine was warm.  Turned out the original ignition switch had finally worn
out and was dropping the voltage by 2 volts on a 6 volt system.  It already
had the relay installed by the PO and that still was not helping. Eric&amp;Barb
