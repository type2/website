Subject: Re: [VB] working bus

Although Clara may not remember
When we lived in LA (in the late 70's) and did real ceramics.
I used to drive from Westwood to the City of Industry to get 2000 lb. of
clay in the 62 bus.
It was way low down and it crept up the ramps to get on the elevated
freeways!
That was a real working bus &amp; it sure did drive differently from being
unloaded.

 &gt; For some reason the bus accelerated, braked, and turned differently
 &gt; with a
 &gt; load in it !
