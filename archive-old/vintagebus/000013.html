&lt;&lt; Thank you very much for all your great info there! I have to go maybe 
SAturday to check the numbers on my Bus, but as far as I know it's a 62. It 
has the small rear window, outward facing engine vents, fisheye directionals 
and pull door handles.&gt;&gt;
Hi Alan,
That could also describe a 1963 though.

&lt;&lt;Will the front and rear backing plates off of say- a 67 bolt up to the 
stock 62 spindles? I know where there's a scrapped 67 with all the running 
gear (minus the tranny) still intact.&gt;&gt;
   No.  You will need to remove the whole front beam and replace it with the 
later style.  You would have to remove every single part off of your old 
front beam and install all of the parts from a later beam to get it working.  
So it is just alot easier to install the later front beam as a complete item. 
 Also get the 1965-67 front antisway beam with the beam or install it 
yourself.  That and tires with stiff sidewalls really help in sidewinds and 
when semi trucks passing you.

&lt;&lt; I've heard of the dual circuit conversion and that was actually one thing 
I had planned on doing, for safety's sake and to protect both myself and my 
Bus. I just basically want to update the brakes on this thing. I noticed the 
right king pin is worn, is that a big deal to replace?&gt;&gt;
Well if you go to the later spindle parts should be easier to get than the 
pre-1964 suspension to get now and in the future.  

&lt;&lt; I told a guy I work with who's worked on VWs since 66 and he said 
something to the effect of &quot;sucks to be you, haha- you couldnt pay me enough 
to do that&quot; I take it that it's not an easy job?&gt;&gt;
   The problem is finding the parts and in some areas of the world finding 
someone who knows how to do the rebuild, has the fixtures and a hydralic 
press.

&lt;&lt; I saw that Bentley manual and I'm ordering it tomorrow as it looks like a 
good investment. Thanks once again! You're great people and I appreciate all 
this advice!
  &gt;&gt;
Glad we could help, Eric&amp;Barb
