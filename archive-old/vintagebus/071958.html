 I didn't really like what I saw.

 Anyway...to the good stuff.  I am pretty sure that I am seeing tiny copper
 flakes in the fine gray sludge in the sump (no more of that than usual, I
 think).  There seems to be copper in the oil in my drain pan, as well, but
 only at the bottom...
 
 Comments?  I want to know if my engine is about to go south, or should I 
drive
 a few hundred to a thousand miles and check again.

coppery stuff tends to mean the bearings are going.   So I'd um, not take any 
long trips.   I'd check the end play and the compression.  It's probably the 
rod bearings, so you can figure out if the engine needs a top end or complete 
rebuild.  You have some time (probably) before it'll throw a rod.  
 Rev it up and listen for the rattle snake as the engine slows down.  If you 
hear that,   the rod is going to break free in the not too distant future.  So 
then park the truck till it gets a fixed motor.

If you ever hear that noise while driving along, turn off the bus.  Do not 
pass Go, do not collect $200.  Call a tow truck.

bits of bearing material should not, repeat NOT, be in your oil.  
whether they are coppery oil sheen flakes or chunks
It is a bad sign.  
period.
