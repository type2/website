Whenever I replace a belt I find that it almost always gets pinched in the
pulley as I tighten up the nut.  As it starts to pinch I rotate the pulley
by hand clockwise (bus in neutral and e brake engaged).  This forces the
belt out of the pinch.  Sometimes I have to do it a few times to get it
right.  I don't know if this is the correct way to do it or not but it has
worked for me over the years.  If the shims are still not right then you
take it all loose and try it again.  Make sure that the tabs on the pulley
halves are engaged with each other.  Bon chance.
