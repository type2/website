...Well, that's 10 or 15 more late beetles and bay
buses that could be there! I hate discussions like
this, though, since it never seems to breed anything
but division, since we all have our ideas about what
vehicles should be allowed in shows that continually
find themselves short of space. Everyone has ideas as
to what should be excluded. I will say this, though,
that I tend to find hardcore splitty bus guys and Ghia
folks tend to be a little more picky about
exclusivity.

There's probably no way we could all agree on this. As
an example, some of y'all would eliminate bay window
buses, and keep type 3's. I'd eliminate type 3's to
keep bay window buses. And then there's always the
Beetle thing - allow Super Beetles? allow 12-volt
Beetles? 

I guess I'm somewhat sensitive to this issue, since I
recently have had problems within my local VW club,
which I lead. (&quot;I am their leader, which way did they
go?&quot;) We are a chapter under the aegis of Southeastern
VW Club, which is an all-inclusive club, from KdF's to
Eurovans. Last year we supported a show sponsored by
the local bus club, which was air-cooled VW's only.
One of our prominent water-cooled members has
indicated that he will not re-join the club, since we
supported that show, and he's tired of the opinions of
several of our members that &quot;wasserwagens don't
count,&quot; which were apparently expressed during our
local club show, which was all-inclusive. Thus, I run
into this type of argument all the time, and have to
sort of swallow my personal opinions. 

Anyway, I guess it's a moot point, since we all have
to follow the rules set for us, in this case.

&gt; &gt;I'm with George on this one. Why not ditch all the
&gt; &gt;Type 3's and go with all buses, bugs, things, and
&gt; Type
&gt; &gt;1 Ghias?
