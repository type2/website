&gt;1.5MHz = 1500 KHz
&gt;the L band will pick up 1610 to 1710 KHz just fine.

Doh!  I even noticed the frequency overlap when I was typing that out
but it didn't occur to me that it would let the L band give you the
upper end of AM broadcast.  You're right.  I better study my 
cycles-to-Hz conversion tables more closely.  :)

As long as you don't tell anybody that I don't follow the OU or OSU
football games even though I live in Oklahoma.  In some counties,
not following one of those teams is a capital offense, apparently...
