Hi All,

The site has been updated to show my new gray undercarriage of the 59 double
cab.

I went this morning and unwrapped the dc and snapped a few pics for you all
the feast your eyes on.


Enjoy!  (I know I do!)

(also, for those that care, a few more pics of the banjo wheel resto are up
as well... wow, what progress!)
