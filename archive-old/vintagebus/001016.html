&gt; The book &quot;VW Bus&quot; by Malcolm Bobbitt (a British publication)
&gt;mentions a **baywindow** camper available in South Africa
&gt;and built by Karmann, called the Jurgens Auto Villa, which was
&gt;based on the pickup variant.  Probably not a slide-in, though.
&gt;Extended above the cab, slept 4, had separate restroom with
&gt;chemical toilet, was very spacious with enough headroom to
&gt;stand up.

I don't know how Karmann enters the picture, but the Jurgens Autovilla was
built by a South African caravan builder called Jurgens, now called
Jurgens-CI after a merger. There were about 1000 Autovillas built, in early
2-berth and late 4-berth configurations. The 4-berther had the roof
extension over the cab, which held a double bed. I don't think they were
built on a pick-up; they are walk-thru, so I suspect they were hacked from a
panelvan. They were built more-or-less between 1974 and 1978. Autovillas
were VWSA-approved, and were sold through VW dealers.

Here is a pic of a 4-berth Autovilla:
