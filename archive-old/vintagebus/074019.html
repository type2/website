&gt;i want to thank rex for inspiring me to work on my vw projects.

Wow, very much appreciated!

I do want to say the whole idea of the double cab was to prove I could 
control myself and not make the vehicle end up in a coma while I &quot;redo&quot; it. 
All my other ones are in that state. I actually take a long time to fix up 
my old VW's. I even made myself a sign on my webpage (warning...slow resto).

In my defense I havn't worked on VW's (other than the quick double cab 
thing) for over a year now. But when I do it is definitely slow. I used to 
beat myself up about it...'til I realized I was doing all this for fun. For 
me...it's a hobby. One that I really enjoy...at least most of the time. So 
feeling like I'm not doing things quick enough makes me not enjoy my hobby. 
So I just don't do that. I take my time and try to enjoy the work. When my 
'59 was done and I got to drive it, there was nothing better. I hope to top 
that when I finally get my single cab on the road.

But the bargain basement slam and jam double cab rat bus project has served 
it's purpose for me. I know I can do it and I've got a bus to drive. I'm 
glad it &quot;inspired&quot; some other folks. That was the intent of me posting 
semi-daily progress reports...I'm glad it worked!
