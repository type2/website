Subject: Re: [VB] VW tool 241a

I made a bearing puller tool adaptor with a speaker magnet , a drill, and a 
angle grinder.    You want that thicker flat metal round with hole in middle 
plate of the speaker (use hammer and chisel to remove it- keep the magnet 
part- always useful for various things.  You want the inner diameter large 
enough to fit behind thebearing,   ya- a pain to make, but it has been 
useful.   Easy to pack on road trips.

ended up looking like a C with 3 holes drilled in it.  Then attached the 
pulley to it and wrenched that bad boy off the axle.

 Hi All,
 
 I went out to the garage tonight to remove the transaxle on my quest to
 narrow the axles 3/4&quot; on the double cab
 (http://www.dsquared-dev_dot_com/davem/narrowrear.htm)  I'm using parts of a
 Wolfgang rear lowering kit.  Anyway, I had semi pressed the rear axle
 bearings in place so I could roll the dc down to the paint shop for some
 minor touch ups and when I went to pull the axle tubes off, I realized that
 the rear bearing race is a reasonable press fit onto the axle.  I got the
 outer bearing race free from the axle tube bearing housing but I can't get
 the bearing to slide off the axle.  When I opened up my type 1 manual, they
 show using a VW 241a tool to pull the bearing off.  I have a puller kit but
 none of the arms have hooks that can fit inside the bearing and get a good
 grip on it.  I guess I could order something but I had some time reserved at
 the machine shop to get things done and I would rather not have to wait....
 
 Any suggestions on how to get the rear axle bearings off the axle???
