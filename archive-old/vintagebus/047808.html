&lt;&lt;Now that I have your attention................
My question is this.......

Does anyone know how many RHD Barndoor Panels were produced??
Thom?? Everett??
I'm thinking it was pretty low making them, dare I say, *RARE*
My reason for asking is simple I've found one (no where near
here) and am having difficulties swallowing the price (I'm cheap
anyway) But I want a long term project that will keep my
attention longer than a few months and I think this is it.

Thanks,
Greg
