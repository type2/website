&gt; whom? 

Hi Michael,
They are Bosch Rev control rotors.  There are several depending on where
you want it to start limiting.  Gene Berg sells these, but you'll have to
pay at least $50 from them to get one.  Bring your wallet.  They are
supposed to be a stock Porsche part, so maybe the Ronnie has some.  I got
one that is limited to 5400 RPM, don't think I ever revved that high.  Just
noticed you are .za so maybe a local Porsche dealer or Bosch.  The
ones Berg sells are for 010 type distributors.
