a friend of mine has a 67 b*g transmission in his bus, recently a rear axle
seal went out and he lost about a qt and a half of gear oil, with that all
being fixed now the only way to stay in 4th is to hold it in gear , it
doesnt take much to hold it but still not right heh anyone have this type of
problem before ? any ideas ?
