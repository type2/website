I was at Kustom 1 the other day and there was a 67 Westy on a flat bed that was
stripped.  It had the single caster on the rear, but the cool thing was that the
front beam was out and they had fabricated basically the same thing for the
front.  The casters consisted of the caster welded to a 6&quot; diameter piece of
pipe 1/2&quot; thick by 12&quot; long, and a 1/2&quot; thick plate welded vertically (in a
notched slot in the pipe along the axis of the caster) to the pipe.  The plate
bolted to the 4 beam mounting holes.

I would have used higher rated casters.  These were inflatable ones, but the
weight of the bus had almost flattened them.

Cool Idea.
