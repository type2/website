The Japanese are doing to the BUS market the same they did to the PORSCHE
356 market of years back. A 60,000 dollar resto (PORSCHE) was the norm back
then when the prices inflated and people were paying it.Today you would be
lucky to get half of that for the car. Look at the bus resto's of today,
30,000 plus to do a Deluxe, 6,000 dollars for a restorable beater. The end
is near as now that the prices have peaked and/or are peaking and the world
economy is on a downslide, a lot of the overseas buses will find there way
back to our Sunny Shores to be resold at the artificially overseas buyer
inflated market. I also wouldn't blame the Japanese for this as there are
just as many Germans and Englishmen buying up buses and sending them across
the pond as we are buying up there buses and bringing them over here. It
would be nice to figure out how many leave as to how many arrive. The stuff
we're getting are rare BD's, High Roofs, Ambo's, Lift trucks, firetrucks and
other assorted models and they are buying our Deluxe and campers. In the
long run we will be ahead (with unique buses).

Ronnie  az  my opinion and does not reflect the rest of the bus world

In short, the Japanese were buying up all of the good VW stuff at
exhorbitant prices, and thus causing runaway &quot;VW inflation&quot; -
raising the price expectations for all other VW stuff.  The subsequent
speculation in VW parts has caused quite a bit of angst in the VW 
community, and is a sore subject with many (hence my wanting to save it
for Friday)
