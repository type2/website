THis would certainly be my #1 suspect.  I always figure on replacing
these just about any time I pull the engine, on general principles.
Did you grease the bearing (not the surface you can see, but the

Also check that the arms on the bearing's carier are straight.
There's a procedure on the type2 web page for this.
