I had a &quot;cheetah&quot; alarm on my bus.
Because there is no existing pin switches on the doors, what I had
installed was a microwave movement detector, so that as soon as
something moved inside the car the alarm sounded (great for leaving the
sunroof open), ultra sonic detectors, and shock sensors (great for
catching the b*st*rds who nudge your car in the carpark)
The anti theft component of the alarm consisted of an ignition killer,
fuel cut out, and a 3 stage immobiliser.
Excessive? Maybe.  But paying $750 for a car alarm is a lot easier to
cope with than the trauma of losing your bus!
