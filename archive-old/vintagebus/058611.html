&gt;
&gt;Hey Y'all,
&gt;Anyone have any good photos of a BN4 gas heater installed their 68-71 bus?  
&gt;I'm trying to figure out how the heater and ducts sit in relation to the 
&gt;spare tire well on the top of the engine compartment and the drivers side 
&gt;rear tire well from the bottom. Does the duct go over \ through the drivers 
&gt;side rear wheel well?  There's some good stuff in the type2 Library, but 
&gt;not a real good picture fromn the engine compartment perspective showing 
&gt;this.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Peace, John Baker
