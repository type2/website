Subject: Re: [VB] Brake pedal return spring

You have to remove the brake pedal assembly from the frame, clean and relube 
it, and install it with a good spring.  Look where the pedal pivots- there is 
a big nut I think at one end- anyway it is fairly straightforward to 
disassemble.  Might need a drift and a mallet to remove it.  Unbolt the pedal 
from the assembly first... 13mm nut and bolt.  Umm- have to remove MC push 
rod bit as well, before removing the assembly.   Do you have a Bentley?

 &gt;            Looking through the Library on type2_dot_com and through some
 &gt;tech books I have. I can't seem to find anything on replacing the Brake
 &gt;Spring. This is the spring that holds the brake pedal &quot;up&quot;. The hook
 &gt;part of mine broke and it needs to be replaced, but it does make driving
 &gt;my bus a little more interesting. Any help would be great.
 &gt;Oh, I drive a early '64 bus.
