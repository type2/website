Hey everyone if you are in the Southwest Missouri area, GROOVE (General
Registry Of Ozarks Volkswagen Enthusiaists) are going to be at steak and
shake on Glenstone on May 1st. Stop by at 2:30, we could use help promoting
our show and our fan drive.
Thanks
Shane Hood
P.S. please E-Mail me if you want to come.
