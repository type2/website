&gt; Accually there is a huge &quot;Bob Marley Festival&quot; going

&gt; show you can check out some reggae then cruise down to
&gt; Desert Sky.  What bus are you driving? I'll look for
&gt; you in the lot.  

61 standard mango green/grey &amp; LOTS of surface rust.

We will probably park in VIP as it makes me nervous leaving my bus
unattended in phish lots...

Are there any good safe places to park close by and walk/take a cab to the
venue?

take care &amp; thanks,

Steve
