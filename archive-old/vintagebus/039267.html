Not exactly what you're looking for, but since
it's close (sorta) I'll post this for all:

There will be a VW show and swap meet in
Placerville, CA (30 miles east of Sacramento)
on Saturday July 11th.  This will be their third
or fourth show in as many years.  We went last
year, small nice, on grass.  Not many of any
particular vehicle, but a nice small show.
It's at the El Dorado County Fairgrounds.  For more 
information call:
530-621-2939  or 530-677-5011

Since it's on the way to our family cabin, on the
day we would go through Placerville anyway,
I think I can talk the family into going.  It's be
interesting to see the reaction from a 10 year
old native of Belarus to a VW show!  His parents
don't even have a car.

Happy 4th all!

Are there any VW shows/ events / swaps happening this 4th of July
weekend in the general Southern Califronia area that anyone knows of??
Thanks!
