&gt; &gt; &gt; What do people think about using 10-30 or 20-50 oil?

&gt; Summer months run 20/50w  or 15/50w synthetics.
&gt; Its just a fact that most Air Cooled VW engines overheat

That brush is a mile wide!  Not all VW engines overheat!

Thick oil is good in a worn engine that has trouble keeping oil pressure
at idle, but it doesn't do anything for a tight new engine.

I run 10W40 year round, and will go to 20W50 on a tired engine if I have
to.
