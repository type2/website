&lt;&lt; Derrick is a bit on the high side on pricing, but he has to make a living.
 He does have a very well kept yard and some interesting vehicles.  He and
 Barb are really nice folks.  Try the swap meets first (or other local
 contacts) for the best pricing.  Then if you can't find it, Way-Out
 probably has it. &gt;&gt;

As another fellow in the same region as Derrick (&amp; Bob) I agree fully with
Bob.  Having been to Derricks place the only bad thing I can say about it is
that it should be named &quot;Way the hell out there Salvage&quot;.  It is a long long
long drive down a dirt road to get to it.
