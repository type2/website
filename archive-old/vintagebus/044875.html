&lt;&lt;I did'nt look real close, but they seemed nice....not for 500 bucks though. 
 They will only fit non ribbed bumpers.  No rears available.  I personally 
think all hurst bumpers are ugly...just me though.

I have to agree.
Those things are the nastiest crap to live on the face of the earth.
Why do you think Hurst/Campbell only made about 500 sets of them!????
Why do people want to put AFTERMARKET AMERICAN CRAP on their german 
automobiles?
The whole idea of the hurst bumpers is for additional protection.
Original bumpers had a 3/8&quot; thick piece of angle iron that connects the 
bottom of the bumper to the front beam!!!
The reproduction bumpers I've seen (Hayt and Stockton) don't provide this.
Get in a front end wreck and the bumpers gonna do more damage than good.
The Haty set was quite a bit better (but still crappy) than the Stockton 
set....
Both sets use muffler shop style bending rather than manderal bending.
Mainly cause its cheaper. Hayt's front uses the wrong O.D. piping! Probably 
cause 1-1/8&quot; &quot;pipe&quot; is different than 1-1/8&quot; tubing! OOPS!
Whatever.....I'm done.
Repop Campbell bumpers=thumbs down.
Anyone gonna do it right?
I have a bunch of the tooling finished........
