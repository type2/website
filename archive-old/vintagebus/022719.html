Subject: Wiper Arm Adjustment?
Mime-Version: 1.0

Well, Northern California is seeing their first good rain in quite a while
this week and, thankfully, I got the window seals replace on the camper
yesterday!  Not a drop of water inside!  &lt;big grin&gt;

But when I went out for coffee tonight, the passenger side wiper cleared
the window nicely but the driver's side isn't doing too well.  Only the
very top is making contact with the window.  I know the quick fix is to
swap the arms, but when I eventually want to see out of the pass. side
window what is going to be the best way (if any) to tweak the arm so the
blade presses against the window more?  Anyone know if it's better to bend
the arm a little closer to the base or the blade?  &lt;shrug&gt;

Seeing out of one eye ;)
