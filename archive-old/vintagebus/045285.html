well, I dont know if anyone will get this becasue I havent gotten any bus list
mail since yesterday afternoon sometime, but I figured what the heck.  it's
Friday.  I'm gonna do something kooky and send mail to the list.

It's nothing special really, but there's a few So Cal shows this weekend that
I wanted to let you all know about.

The first one is Saturday at the Deer Springs Winery in Escondido CA (northern
San Diego county) at Deer Springs Road and I15.  Head east and you'll find it.
I've never been to this show before, but it's put on by Strictly Vintage II's
and from what their web page shows about it, it looks like a blast.  We'll be
there......starts 9am Saturday (show, swap, fun)

Sunday is the Jamboree at the Orange County Fair Grounds (55 and 405
freeways).  I havent ever been to this one either and I'm a bit skeptical, but
I havent seen a Bikini contest in a while so I cant pass this one up either
(NOT!!)  Oh well, if ya dont like, dont watch.  But we'll be there too

At both shows we'll be in our primer gray and margarine yellow 1971 Notchback.
I know it's not a bus, but ours is sans engine (among other things)at the
moment, and the Notch is cool.  VERY few late model Notch's in the US (maybe
less than 10).  One if us (me or Katie) will prolly have a tacky hawaiian
shirt on and maybe  a lifeguard style straw hat with Empi shoe laces holding
them around our chins.  I always have a teal, purple and grey camera bag with
me too so if you see us, COME OVER AND SAY HI!!!!!!  we have yet to meet any
bus list members at shows (except for Everett and Van Bondo)  Hopefully we'll
see some of you.

Matt and Katie
