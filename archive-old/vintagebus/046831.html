&lt;&lt; While we're visualizing that area, what would the function be of a factory 
looking hook mounted to the top-rear of the rear lower pully shroud? Too high 
to be a crank starter guide, about a 1.5&quot; opening. I found one on a '66 
standard.  &gt;&gt;
Hi Harry,
It is for the 40 HP engine with Eberspacher gas heater or early 1500 engine 
that had it's preheat paper tube go from the left of the engine to the 
rightside postioned air cleaner.  Could we buy/trade it from you?
