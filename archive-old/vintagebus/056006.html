Subject: Re: [T2] [friday] Regarding &quot;Deadhead/hippie&quot; buses...


My mother was one of 7 and My grand parents bought a brand new blue and
white 65 standard  to haul them and 1 set of my great grand parents around
in. 11 people. My mom and aunt always got the luggage shelf. It was the only
new car they could afford to buy. They kept it up untill the 80's when My
uncle rolled it over into a ditch and totaled it.

I had to have one after I saw a 15 window in a class mates hot vws in 9th
grade english class. up untill that moment I wanted a nova. I've been hooked
ever since.


&gt;
&gt; My parents had a split-window that they sold when Dad got promoted to GS7
in
&gt; the Bureau of Public Roads and they could afford a car with heat. In West
&gt; Yellowstone, Wyoming, that's important. They're not hippies; they bought
the
&gt; Bus because it was the cheapest thing they could get that would haul four
&gt; kids.
&gt;
&gt; Later, my aunt &amp; uncle bought a standard Loaf with the middle seat; they
&gt; bought it because it would hold seven kids.
