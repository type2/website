Subject: 58 dd panel FOR SALE what will you pay?

--part1_40.2287e7b4.2a92e31d_boundary

hello all,
  
 I am going to sell my 58 panel bus but am having trouble getting a good 
value for it . Anyone interested in buying it or a owner of a 58 double 
door panel  have Idea of its value. I invested over seven thousand in parts 
and supplies and did all of the work myself.  It is mechanically great with 
new everything. when I restored the bus my body work was far from perfect, 
painted the original dove blue color.

It now has issues of wavy mud filled panels and imperfections out the wazoo!
it has less than 6 k on the following parts all brake parts every one of them 
!!
rebuilt engine dual port with 009 , new carb and fuel pump relined gas tank,
new heat exchangers and muffler ,12volt system everything works . see 
pictures at www.ohiobusworks_dot_com. truck is believed to be 73 k original miles.

any one interested please let me know this should go to a good home
thanks John    dayton Ohio    vwbus58_at_aol_dot_com
