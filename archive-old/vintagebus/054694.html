Yes.  At any point.

&gt; but the linkage is a clean brake not sawed.and my other
&gt; question is are bug and bus linkages the same?

Extreme differences between bug and bus...and indeed between various years
of bus.


Where exactly did yours break?  Most common is the rear rod-to-transaxle
coupling, and when it goes it generally just pops apart.

But failures in all of the other components can happen as well...metal
fatigue can do amazing things.
