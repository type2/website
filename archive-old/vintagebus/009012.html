Subject: gas line routing?

So, I'm confused about the path the fuel line should follow from where it
comes in through the body to the fuel pump.  It used to go under the paper
air hose, but it was touching the heat riser.  That seemed wrong, so I put
it over the paper air hose, which also seems wrong.  Now it seems to have a
gravity problem, so that I have to keep the gas tank over 1/4 full or no gas
comes thru the line.  Hmm...  Can somebody please enlighten me here?
The official volkswagen idiot,
