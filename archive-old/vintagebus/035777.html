  Is cauliflower the same plant  as wild mustard?  Is a leek an onion?   Is 
peppermint the same as spearmint ?  each of these sets share the same Genus.  
Then again, is chihuahua the same as an Australian Shepard the same as a 
wolf?   would it make a difference which of these three canines you picked to 
herd your sheep?   yes, because they have differnt characteristics.     I 
trained a Aussie Shepard to herd cats, like when they scratched the furnture, 
and the dog would leave the cats alone when I said to stop !!!  This animal 
liked to herd- whether cats, or people or other animals, and easy to train 
too, just a little encouragement and she learned the signals.   Now the 
Chihuahua would not do that at all.      If you plant hemp seed, what grows 
would not give you a good high if you smoke it,  just a headache.

They are similar, and related, but not actually the same.     But I'm not 
making the laws.

OBC:   Hemp does seem a material tough enough to make seat covers that will 
last decently.  And wont be sticky on hot days like vinyl.    seat covers 
made of   lace wont last very long.      The hemp ones are also less pricey 
tha the TMI vinyl ones.   I don't like that new vinyl smell either, gross.  
gives it that icky 'new car made of plastic' smell.   Give me that horsehair 
old VW smell anyday over the vinyl.

actually it is the same plant, and state law in alabama says that any part

of the plant is illegal, they just dont prosecute for it because the

mercedes plant uses hemp in thier dash pads, and walmart sells hemp seed as

bird seed, etc,
