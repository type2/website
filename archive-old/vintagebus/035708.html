nuts. How tight should they be?&gt;&gt;

Hi TJ,
Ahh!!!???  Which nuts?  If you mean the spindle lock nut/s you want to 
tighten them till you just seat the bearings and feel this action by hand.  
Then loosen these nuts about 1/6-1/8 turn.  It is like valve adjustment too 
little is deadly a bit too much will not destroy it.  FYI you need to tighten 
the lug bolts to only 85 Ft. Lbs..   Eric&amp;Barb
