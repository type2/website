Wow! I've got one of these that has the original, working speaker and an
antenna out of a bus. Is it really worth $100...

Its all relative to how much you want for it and how much people are willing
to pay.  I personally wouldn't pay $100 for a Saphire radio unless it looked
NOS and still had knobs.  If it were a period Blaupunkt, that price be very
reasonable for a mid-condition radio.  
One opinion in a sea of millions...
