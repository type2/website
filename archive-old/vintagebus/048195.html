&lt;&lt;  Looks like my only
 real problem is a bad seal - the bearings themselves are really nice and
 tight, almost as nice as the new ones!  I think I'll leave them be, unless
 anyone can give me a good reason to replace them. &gt;&gt;
Hi Thom,
Make sure you inspect both the innner and outer races that the ball bearings
run in.  If the bearings are of newer manufacture and have the plastic instead
of steel retainers that space the ball bearings.  Then you can remove the
plastic retainer which clips into place around the ball bearings.  This will
allow you a better unobstructed view of the races and if you find any
blemishes there, replace the bearing.  Also if you find you have to replace
some of your bearings you would be better off to keep used bearings seperate
from new bearings by installing them in different reduction gear boxes.  Then
if you have any extra good used bearings put them in your onboard spare parts
for future use.  There is nothing more annoying than to replace some of the
bearings with new, only to have some of the old go bad soon (10,000-50,000
miles later.) after and shrapnel the new ones when in the same reduction box.
After all if the tranny oil is changed every 30,000 miles (We prefer to change
ours at 20,000 miles.) the reduction gear box bearings should last at least
100,000 miles.
