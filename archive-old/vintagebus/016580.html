&gt; &gt; &gt; I have heard that the oil temperature raise with about 10% if

(my reply)

&gt; &gt;  John Muir in one of his many monologs in the idiot book states 
&gt; this but
&gt; &gt; the &quot;10%&quot; is a new one...

Lars,
We all say a lot of things, isn't that's why we have the list?
The late Mr. Muir said a lot of things...
A proponent of centrifugal advance dizzys, meditation exercises involving
hand tools to get your head straight, and other more anthropological
statements reflective of his era. (ie if your engine over heats jump in
the back of the bus and ball until the engine cools, with no admonition
to do it safely.)
Most everyone who has ever lifted a engine lid on a veebub has a greasy
copy of this book or at least a opinion about it. To some, JM is a guru
and a better traveling companion than St. Christopher. To others, he is a
fool to spread such statements.

(my favorite part of the idiot book is the groovy illustrations)
Aloha
Ken

ps. if  you want more info on the windows open thing, think &quot;air flow&quot;,
do a type2 archive search on remote oil coolers, elephant ear side
scoops, etc. at  www.type2_dot_com.
