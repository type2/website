&gt; I have some relatives in the UK,so if they are available there, i could get

&gt; if you can't use the oil bath air cleaner-maybe that alone makes a
&gt; difference. In a recent test drive of my bus-i didn't have the oil bath air
&gt; cleaner-and there was a noticable difference in throttle response. i cleaned
&gt; the filter out(or tried to anyway with kerosene)about 1.5 years ago, maybe
&gt; it is so clogged that it is affecting performance.

No, it just changes the nature of the vacuum in the carburator.  If the
carb is adjusted for the oil bath cleaner it should get worse when the
cleaner is removed.
