Hey, y'all...

I am finally attempting the creation of a website.....it'll be cheesy and
unsubtle I'm sure, but I promise I'll get better...

I am asking any and all of you who have sites if there is any reason I
should not link to them from the VW section of my page(s).  I'll be
contacting Webmeisters individually, but I need to get my basic outline
going first, so I get a good idea of the organizational problems...

I'll post the address as soon as I get it up.

Gene
