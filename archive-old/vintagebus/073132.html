Subject: Headliner in a Kombi

I currently have a headlining in my Kombi that is not very nice.  It is the perforated vinyl but has not been fitted very well, and over the cab the original cardboard pieces have been covered and are falling down.  It seems that bows have been fitted for the rear of the bus.

What have other listees done about having headlinings in Kombis?  This is a camper conversion so I would like a nice new headlining.  I guess I could try a plywood headling, but would prefer a vinyl one.

If I were to use plywood, I can imagine the back pieces aren't too difficult to fabricate (what thickness ply?) but I doubt the front pieces would be easy due to the curves required?

PS my problem with my engine last week turned out to be a dodgy lead - it was arcing by the spark plug.  The CDI makes the arc sound a lot louder that was audible from the drivers seat.
