&lt;&lt;Hey everybody, 
&lt;&lt;&lt;since it's Friday, can I just say &quot;what's the deal
&gt;&gt;&gt;with the crow's feet thread?!&quot;

I dunno.

&gt;&gt;&gt;When you put the hubcap on the wheel, does it look any
&gt;&gt;&gt;different from the non-crow's feet rims?

Yep, the &quot;slots&quot; on the sides are larger and more pyramid shaped on the crows 
foor rims.

Another question:

&gt;&gt;When did VW go from the slash end bumpers to the
&gt;&gt;symetrical (pointed) ends?

65 or so.


&gt;&gt;&gt;My 67 has a symetrical front bumper, and a repro slash
&gt;&gt;&gt;rear. I'd rather have the pointed rear if that's
&gt;&gt;&gt;correct. Is it?

Yep.

&gt;&gt;&gt;And what's the deal with the splash guards? Is that
&gt;&gt;&gt;stock? When?

Yep, 1953-197?

&gt;&gt;And if that weren't enough toask, what about the
&gt;&gt;rubber guards on the overriders? Stock? aftermarket?
&gt;&gt;or optional?

Accessory, aftermarket, ugly. =)
