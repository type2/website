Subject: RE: [VB] Should I Cut Up A Bus?

 How about this, cut off the parts you need for the Westys, and replace them (on the panel) with repop'd pieces. Yeah sure, the panel won't be the same and that is probably more work than you are willing to do, but atleast it would stay together. But you know, as soon as you cut it up, you'll find that rust free (but wrecked in a weird place and not fixable) 57 Kombi for cheap that has all the right parts intact...

WHOA! this is DEFINITELY NOT a money issue for me. this is 
a good parts source and the change to get what i need for the future and for 
others to do so as well. if this were a money issue, i'd just sell it and be 
done.

i am NOT in this for money, and this is NOT why i am 
considering these options.

sure, i like money, but i have a job for 
that!

I have seen some very clean kombis cut to pieces

for a couple pieces of

sheet metal to save Deluxes ( a waste in my

opinion), but the people doing

it make a lot more money on a pieced together Deluxe

then they would of on a

nice dry Kombi!



ronnie it's your stuff do what you need to do





And we all love money, in fact that's why we do this,

for the love of the money.
