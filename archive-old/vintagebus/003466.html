    Soak it with some erl or something.... will make it easier to remove at
the flange on the backing plate.
    Bentley depicts the drivetrain being removed *with* the cables
attached.... it's a good idea to replace these after so many years anyways.
    A friend's '71 had frayed cables which, although they didn't break in
two, had frayed enough to cause one rear brake to drag.
    A month or so ago, one of our instructors at the school was driving an
old harley around when one of the brake cables broke upon application of the
brakes. He lost control of the bike and unfortunately didn't survive the
accident.
    This is something especially important to think about for those of us
still running the single-circuit MC...
