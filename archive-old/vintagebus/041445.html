&gt; That sucks... (get it?)

&gt; So we're up to 3 motors destroyed over the weekend?  Perhaps the real motive
&gt; behind hosting shows out in BFE arizona is to generate parts business.  Like
&gt; to giving a product away for free, then haing a 900 number for support...

Some people think it's fun to drive a bus a few miles and hang around in
the dirt a couple days.  Blowing a motor is all in a good days fun.
Next year we should have a bus hill climb across the arroyo?
That way we could damage trannys and front beams too.:)
Hope your damage is minimal JP.
Thanks Ronnie, John, Lou &amp; all.
Good folks, good place, good fun.
