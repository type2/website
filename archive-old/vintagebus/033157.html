Okay.  Do this- go to your bus.  Clear any stuff off the passenger seat.   
take hold of the top of the back of the passenger side seat.  pull it forward 
and slightly up.  Watch as it tilts forward- the entire passenger seat- as 
yes the backrest and bottom part are one thing.  Just grab the top and pull 
it forward.   Now you can see behind it.

 and back is the only one.  There is no distinction between the back
 and the bottom, thus I can't look behind the seat.

 Jeff,
 
 If it is the original seat, it should be in two sections.  1/3 (driver)
 2/3(passanger).  Its a bench seat...right?  The passenger seat will tilt as
 a
 unit forward hinged at the base of the front part of the seat.  Grab the top
 of the seat (2/3rds section) and tilt it forward. Look closely and you'll
 see
