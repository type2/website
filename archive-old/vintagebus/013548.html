&gt; I love seeing this stuff.  
&gt; 
&gt; Here's a '60 Westy for sale, restored.  Center table
&gt; appears to be missing, forward cabinet (the one the
&gt; breadbox sits on) appears to be missing, claims to
&gt; have original curtains but look far from original,
&gt; no icebox cabinet (o.k. it was an option), huge
&gt; speaker cut into the closet, funky tuck and roll
&gt; velour front seat covers, I'll stop here. 
&gt; Price......$18,500.  Can be seen at:

&gt; 
&gt; Don't get me wrong, I'm not dissing the bus at all. 
&gt; What does amaze me is that here is yet another
&gt; example of a bus that has been restored, far from
&gt; the way I would do it if I were going to go to the
&gt; effort of doing it, and priced with a pretty hefty
&gt; tag.  I'm not trying to start another custom vs.
&gt; stock flame war.  I just want us all to continue to
&gt; be reaffirmed that our beloved buses are becoming
&gt; very valuable, no matter what's been done to them. 
&gt; Granted this is the asking price, who knows, it may
&gt; sell for $20,500.
&gt; 
&gt; I was also looking in the L.A. Times classifieds
&gt; this morning and saw a private collector's ad
&gt; selling off his vehicles.  Ferraris, Porsches,
&gt; Mercedes, T-Birds.  One of his most expensive cars
&gt; was a '49 Split Window, $25,000. 
&gt; 
&gt; To each his own, just make sure and keep yours, or
&gt; at least one!
