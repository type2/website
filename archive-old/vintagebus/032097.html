&lt;&lt; While you are all very right about cost...as the saying 
goes speed costs money or in this case power costs money 
no matter in what form. ......

As for the IRS again you can do the IRS without lowering the 
bus.  VERY costly! ........  

.......any time you go the high performance route, especially 
if done right it will at least cost double of a quality stock job 
usually more. 

.......PLEASE DON'T CUT EM, I am tired of welding them 
back together.  &gt;&gt;

For far less cost and hassle you can have your stock reduction
gear box trans rebuilt to take on any hp that a Type IV can
put out.  Shoehorning a IV motor into a Split-Bus is one thing
but adapting a later IRS and its associated suspension 
components is something else all together.   But then anything
is possible if you throw enough money at it.   What I would
do is figure out what is most important about this vehicle.  Do
you want something a bit more peppy to drive or do you want
a garage queen that is an ongoing never-ending project?
