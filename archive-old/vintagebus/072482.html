Subject: RE: [VB] oil temps

&gt; Jerry at Northwest Connecting Rod says that the new aluminum blocks run 15-30
&gt; degrees hotter than the faster cooling OEM magnesium alloy. He has been
&gt; drilling all that he gets in, including mine, for full flow and external
&gt; coolers. I would run an inline thermostat too to regulate the temp. It's just
&gt; as hard on your engine if the oil is too cool.


Makes me go Hmmmmmm.
I just cant see why this would make that much difference.
Does it seem that the sump fins and case surface could account for that
much of the cooling?
Id really want to see some scientific methodology applied here.
