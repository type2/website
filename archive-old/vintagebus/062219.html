Subject: Re: [VB] fabricating &amp; installing new front door panels

I went for a pseudo-westy look on my 65.

Started by prepping the doors.  When done, I put thin plastic sheeting on them with the bottoms hanging inside the door as Clara describes.  
Attached the plastic sheeting with some elmer's squeeze-n-caulk and duct tape.

Next, made a template from some cardboard left over from a big box.  Got this template as perfect as I could, with all the holes in the right places.  
Checked on both doors.

Next, cut out lauan doorskins (8' x 3' x 1/8&quot; or so, $7.50 at local hardware store) per the template and covered them with a matte polyurethane, both 
sides, several coats.  I think there's more polyurethane than wood now.  You could skimboard with them.  You could panel submarines with em - 
exterior.

Put 'em on with repop original-style clips.  Pic of results at http://www.supernet_dot_net/~jclark/vw/65neunsitzer/bus6.jpg.  Even with the template, the 
fit was not dead-on, probably due to carelessness and the difficulty of getting the template to flex like the would wood.  I mean wood would.

I was worried that the wood would NOT flex properly at that point under the ventwing but it did fine and the clips are still holding tight several months 
later.  That's the only point I was thinking about using screws on, but didn't have to.

I did all the side panels this way - see http://www.supernet_dot_net/~jclark/vw/65neunsitzer/index.html.  Like I say, a sort of impressionistic pseudo-
westy look, not original but what the hell, the original interior was literally gone anyway.  All the cargo area panels are put on with screws and trim, 
mostly using original holes.  Again: templates, I tell you!  Templates!  Tedious, but less nail-biting when it's time to cut the wood.
