Hmm.  At this point, it would probably have been cheeper to 

a) cut windows in a barndoor panel
b) weld up the windows in a barndoor deluxe

Then again, doesn't the VW Museum have &quot;barndoors&quot; that really aren't?

While he's at it, he should install a BD-deluxe dash and an early 
tube radio.  I have a split-window/barndoor *removable* radio that
would work perfectly.

And a RHD conversion would set the whole thing off nicely.

Hmmm.  And '53 and earlier rubbing strips.  Oh wait, *I'm* doing that one!
