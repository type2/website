Subject: Re: [VB] Ate MC rebuild kit question

Hi Mike,
Unless you can find someone on this list with ATE brake catalog or a friendly 
FLAPS in your area to figure that out, then you will just have to remove and 
dissassemble you present MC and compare the parts.
  Personally we would just convert to dual circuit MC and have alot safer 
system where if you blow a wheel cylinder or brake line you will still have 
50% brakes.  Instead of no foot brakes and only E-brake that you would break 
off, way before you equaled foot brake power with it!  Check the type2 
library for dual MC in pre-1968 buses conversion using a 1972 and later bus 
MC and some easy to get junk yard parts for about $50.00 or buy a dual 
circuit 1967 MC.
