Subject: RE: [VB] Front engine compartment seal

Well, I have no idea how the book calls out for it to be installed. But from
working in this little airplane company here in Seattle I have found the
gaskets that things need to seal against are pointed towards the item that
will rest agaisnt it. I have always pointed all three seals down and when I
jack my engine into place the seal presses down against the sheet metal
forming a tight engine compartment seal. Never had exsaust leaks in my
engine compartment from the seals. Now, the pre heat tubes, that's another
subject.

Geez, somebody must know how the engine compartment firewall seal is
installed?  Lip pointing up or down?
