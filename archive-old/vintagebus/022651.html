Everything is bigger in Canada, eh?

Make sure the shoe &quot;tangs&quot; are fully seated, wobble the shoe back and forth
to see if it's really in and the slot of the piston isn't canted to the
side, and then open the bleeder screw and &quot;squeeze&quot; the shoes in.
Sometimes, if you've been playing with the pedal while they're apart, the
pistons will come out and not go all the way back down.  

Also check to make sure you have the ebrake setup on correctly, if applicable.

&gt;fully adjusted in and all looks as it should per Bentley.  This is a '67
&gt;with a big nut tranny and the 250mm brakes.  The lining depth is 8mm on
&gt;the new shoes  (less backing plate).  Is this correct?  The shoes are
&gt;made in Canada.  What might I be wrong?  Could they given me bay window
&gt;brakes??
