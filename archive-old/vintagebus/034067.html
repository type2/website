Hi Chris,
Welcome to the world of old flexable brake lines.  After five or six years
they have a habit to have the inner hose (Each brake line hose is actually
two hoses one inside of the other.) the breaks and then eithere clogs the
brake line or acts like a one way valve.  Replace all four of your brake
lines and prevent futher problems.
