Today is the birthday of my bus (01 12  0), a 1961 15 window 
deluxe.  I have been on the list(s) for years but stay pretty quiet.  
However, this will soon change because I am beginning a major 
restoration and have few buses in my area (Burlington VT) to 
compare with.  In preparation of painting, I am removing everything 
from inside and outside with the exception of the transmission.  
Last night I came across a broken cable and cable housing in the 
engine compartment.  It's attached to the top of the engine 
compartment and goes through to the cargo area on the left side 
next to the rear hatch.  Any ideas?  Original or PO installed?

Also, a PO drilled a hole in the dash where later models have a gas 
gauge.  This forces me to put a gas gauge in.  A friend gave me a 
tank with a sender unit.  I would also like to keep the original set 
up with the option of running on reserve (the best of both worlds).  I 
was disappointed to see that the original reserve mechanism on 
the tank was gone.  Is there a source for these?  Anybody 
interested in selling me one? 

 In regards to painting the bus.  It was originally Sealing Wax Red 
and a Gray (SR and BGR).  I want it to be sealing wax red and 
white (or is it off white?).  My painter is going to use ppg paint.  
How do find the codes for these colors?  

Hey, thats enough for now, thanks in advance for your responses.

Jeff
