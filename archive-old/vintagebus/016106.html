	I beg to differ :-)  There was a double door 66 camper at one of our
shows ( sundial I think ) that was set up real nice. The table was in the
center between the doors, small cabnets on the doors, still had the frig.
and sink, and all the other goodies that came with campers. Even had two
tents, it was cool.
