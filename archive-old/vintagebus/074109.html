&gt; 1) there is a bunch of oil right below the pulley where the oil pump cover 
&gt; is.
&gt; Could this be mearly a gasket issue or more like a main seal from the 
&gt; pulley?
&gt; It does not look like the oil is coming from the pulley area (pulled the 
&gt; pulley to get the sheet metal off)

Hi Tom,
Sounds like you need to check the nuts that hold on the oil pump cover for 
proper torque.  If that is not the problem it will need a new paper gasket which 
in a pinch can be made with yellow pages paper that is very close to the same 
thickness of the original.
