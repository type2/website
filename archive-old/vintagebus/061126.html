Subject: Back home in Albuquerque (might be long)

Well list,

I arrived home in Albuquerque Tuesday afternoon after
a great bus adventure.  Friday, I took a train to
Kingman, Arizona on my way to retrieve my '62 Panel
from Rich Yost at Old Buses.  Ronnie picked me up at
12:30 AM (I won't tell them it was your first long
distance trip in Tracey's PT Cruiser, Ronnie), and we
went back to Lake Havasu City where Ronnie, as usual,
kept me up way past my bedtime talking busses.

Saturday, Ronnie and I went to the SoCal area where we
picked up his new (old, rusty, bent, according to his
wife) Allstate singlewheel trailer and I got my bus on
his trailer (not without incident - don't look behind
my front bumper).  There isn't a better bus friend
than Ronnie.  Got back to Lake Havasu, got some sleep
(I really like that air bed, Tracey), and readied my
'61 Panel (new body work and paint were immaculate,
but the usual problems with a bus that was off the
road for two years) for a 500+ road trip.

Just hit the road with my 40 horse, small nut, 6V,
untouched other than valve adjustment and oil change,
shiney bus at 6 o'clock Monday morning (Ronnie said he
saw me drive away wondering if I needed to borrow a
spare tire) and, just missing the flood in Gallup, NM,
made it home with no trouble Tuesday afternoon.

Thanks to Rich Yost for a great job of bodywork and
paint, and an especial thanks to Ronnie for all his
hospitality.  Also everyone who offered help if I
broke down!

JP

Safely back in Albuquerque after quite a trip.
