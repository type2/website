&gt; Contrary to your initial thoughts, this is 100% bus &gt;content.  I lowered
the front of my bus a while ago and &gt;finally bought a set of Bus Boys
&quot;boomerangs&quot; for the &gt;rear this month. The PO installed an IRS suspension in
&gt;the back with the wide five bolt pattern on it. I _think_
 &gt;the drums are from a Type 3, but can't be certain. &gt;Anybody?
&gt;My main question: The axle nuts are significantly larger &gt;than my 36mm
socket and I wondered if anyone knew &gt;what size they might be? According to
Muir, there are &gt;3 sizes available, but I don't know which this is. My
 &gt;micrometer doesn't get that big. :-(
