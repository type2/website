Deisel, 
Form previous posts, I think you have a 65-67 deluxe,
right?

This trim is for earlier deluxes (pre-63?) whose
louvers for the engine intake were punched out rather
than punched in. The trims went along the outer edge
of the louvers.

&gt; &gt; a deluxe bus.  I've never seen this before. 
&gt; Someone care to explain?
