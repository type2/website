Subject: Ron on vacation

Just a quick note that I will be out of town from tomorrow morning through
the end of next week, first on vacation (Sedona, Arizona and then visiting
friends in Burbank, California) and then at the SEMA automotive show in Las
Vegas. I will try to check email when possible but it may be sporadic. So
don't count on any email you send to me personally being read before my
return.

Instead, you can always email  sales_at_busdepot_dot_com . This is the standard Bus
Depot email address that you should use anyway for most inquiries; it
reaches Jerry De Baun, who will not be on vacation.  And it's business as
usual at the shop.  (In fact, we actually pretty caught up on orders at the
moment; for the most part they're being delivered well ahead of our standard
7-10 working day timeframe, although don't quote me on that. :-)
