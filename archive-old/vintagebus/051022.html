Subject: RE: [VB] What exaust should I use?

Just remember the exaust studies. The air flow over the top of the bus will
drag your exaust up and to the side and be allowed to be sucked back into
the fresh air intakes. You must vent exaust at least to the side of the bus
and slightly down to prevent it from being cycled back into the vehicle.
Bugs and type 3 don't have this problem because air flow is different over
them.

Ya I don't think any exaust peice should be attatched to the bumper. This
idea is based on custom tail pipes only. I don't think they'll even be long
enough to need to be braced.

&gt; Hmm, my original muffler on my truck has one clamp around the tailpipe
&gt; extension and it bolts to the bumper bracket at the body. If you look at
the
&gt; breakdown of the parts for the transporter muffler it will show that
&gt; bracket. Nowhere did I say anything clamped to the bumper, just exteded
out
&gt; to the end of the bumper so the exaust was diverted away from the vehicle.
&gt; Look in your Bently manual. Or there is a picture at busdepot_dot_com

&gt;
&gt; Hate to bother you guys because I missed out on part of this thread.
What's
&gt; this about support straps to the bumper?  Sounds like a problem.  The
bumper
&gt; doesn't vibrate in sync with the engine, therefore, something is going to
&gt; eventually shear.
&gt;
&gt; The stock bus muffler has a support bracket that connects the tail pipe to
&gt; the end of the muffler expansion chamber.  The bugpack has a strap that
&gt; clamps the muffler body to the header I think.  I've never seen anything
&gt; that clamps the muffler to the bumper that lasts for long.

&gt;
&gt; &gt;Support straps against vibration and extension to at least the end of the
&gt; &gt;bumper. If it works, I'll order a set.

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;I've decided to attempt to have custom exaust tips fashioned for my stock
&gt; &gt;bug muffler. Each tip will be ported off to each side. I think that a
stock
&gt; &gt;bus muffler will have too much back pressure for my 1641cc. Two reasons:
&gt; (1)
&gt; &gt;only one tailpipe as opposed to two, increasing back pressure (2) the
stock
&gt; &gt;bus tip narrows at the end, causing even more back pressure. Anyone have
&gt; any
&gt; &gt;thoughts on this idea?

&gt; &gt;&gt; just spend the 100 bucks and get a real complete bus exhaust from bus
&gt; &gt;&gt; depot. ive run all sorts and there is really nothing as good in a bus
as
&gt; &gt;&gt; the real thing.
