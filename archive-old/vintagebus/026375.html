Check and make sure all your fittings at the wheels and master cylinder
are tight.  1st way is to see if you're losing brake fluid at the master
cylinder or see puddles where the hoses connect to the wheel cylinders.
Second thing to check is brake adjustment.  When you installed the parts
did you adjust the shoes until you could barely hear them whisper
against the drum?  That's my first guess actually
