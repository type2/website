Porsche had them in the 50's on their 356's, if I recall up till the 63 B
model, so I guess when Porsche went to the single plastic twin squirter VW
used up all they're old stock of squirters, these are still available from
Stoddard Imports last time I checked, another secret out of the bag.

My 61 ambulance is allso equiped with the same type squirters as you
describe.
This bus was bought from the norwegian army in the early eightys, but was
left in someones garden until 95 when i bought it.
Is these squirters an OG/ ambulance thing? The mounting holes in the car
looks factory like. M code?

&gt; I noticed the squirters that shoot fluid on the windows were make of a
&gt; little flat chrome or stainless steel disc with a tiny brass fitting on
the
&gt; side which could be adjusted with a wrench to aim the fluid properly.  The
&gt; only squirters I ever know of were the elcheapo plastic ones you aim with
&gt; pin.
