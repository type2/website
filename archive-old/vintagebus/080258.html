Subject: Re: [VB] No Response - 2nd Try: Help Tuning My Bus

Basically it's a carb adjustment... do to the pressure difference in the air 
from the elevation change.  Says something useful in the Muir Idiot book about 
it.    I didn't notice much difference  in driving when I went from near sea 
level to over 5000 feet though.   I don't do dual carbs though,   cause I 
don't want to mess with carbs all the time.  since you do have dual carbs, so must 
be happy with messing with them... ask the local dual carb VW folk.  

funny... why do people w/  dual carbs bother with electronic ignition to 
'save time during tune-ups'    Why do I stay w/ points and say dual carbs are time 
suction devices?   

wondering... a gallon of gas at sea level is how many gallons at 5,000 ft? 
 PV=mRT... so what's the difference in Pressure, the inverse of that being 
the difference in Volume (with all other conditions remaining the same)
