&gt;&lt;&lt; The bottle claims that their oil is rated for BOTH GL4 AND GL5 service.
&gt;Is this possible?  &gt;&gt;
&gt;Hi Kabayo,
&gt;Sure it is, but still not good for your VW brass syncros, and probably worse
&gt;for cheaper aftermarket ones.   Eric&amp;Barb




If there is an additive package for GL5 which harms early trannies, then
how could that oil be rated for GL4?

I'm thinking that perhaps Valvoline has come up with an additive package
which can meet BOTH performance standards.  Isn't this a possibility?
