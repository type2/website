How does one describe the difference between
a crafted truck, such as a crewcab Binz, that
was produced by a company other than the
original vehicle manufacturer, from the same
vehicle crafted years after the vehicle was
originally produced?

How would one 'label' a true '54 Binz from
one that ronnie crafted from a '54?

OOTD I intend to put up a website devoted
to CrewCabs of all makes and manufacturers
and want to distinguish between two vehicles
of the same base truck year, and one created
at the time of delivery to the first customer,
versus one that was created years later.

Jeff 

no busses, but drooling at the smoothgate Binz 
picture on Everett's webpage, however, I do own 
a Binz equivalent of a F*rd crewcab though
