Finally got the new engine installed last night...I went to try and start it
and nothing...

the headlights do not work. when i turn the key the red and green lights do
not come on.

The turn signal, flasher, dome lights, windshield wipers all work.

all fuse are good(i think, no resistance in them)

while waiting for my new engine, i took the fuse box apart, and had cleaned
all the connections. i am 99.99999% positive i hooked everything up correctly
when i put it back together(i made a diagram before i took it apart).

 I also took the regulator off and cleaned all of its connections. 

I took the brushes out of the generator and cleaned them off as well.

it was two in the morning, and my last bulb burned out, so i couldn't take the
fuse box apart(not enought light). 

i checked muir, and his suggestions did not seem to apply. I assume i must
have hooked something up incorrectly, not sure what.

perhaps i hooked the coil up incorrectly(oh yeah i cleaned all those
connections too).

i admit i forgot how the wires go to the coil, and as  a little off on the new
carb. The wiring diagram just shows hooking things up the coil(condenser, one
wire to carb, and black wire to something else i forget) anyway the diagram
does not indicate which one should go to the  positive and which one negative
on coil...instinctively i assume red is positive, and black negative...

hope this makes sense, i am pretty beat after these continual long
days...thanks for any suggestions on trouble shooting...
