Subject: Re Kelly Park Divisions--

This can get to be tricky deciding who is in and who is out.--Case in point, at a VW show
in Phoenix--My 1963 Hearse was disqualified from winning any thing in the Type II class
because &quot;It is not a real VW bus&quot;!  that is what i was told--
by the person in charge of the car show. I showed them the brochures from Frickinger and
said that this was the brochure given to a person who came into a VW show room and wanted
a Hearse. The single cab was then taken off the assembly line and sent to Augsburg Germany
where it was coach
built.  No different then taking a bus to the Westfalia people.  Made no difference i lost
my case--The Hearse to them is still not considered a real VW Bus.
