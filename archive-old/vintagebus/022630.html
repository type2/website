&gt;Forward to vintagebus please.
&gt;
&gt;Thx,
&gt;
&gt;&gt; My daughter is giving a speech in her 6th grade class on Wednesday. Her
&gt;&gt; topic, chosen by her, is the VW Westfalia camper conversions. While well
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Her speech was delayed until today. So off she went loaded down with pics
&gt;and info from all those who helped out. She gave her speech and her teacher
&gt;responded with: &quot;very informative, I had no idea there where so many
&gt;differences in the VW campers&quot; His comments included &quot;nice intro&quot; &quot;very
&gt;informative&quot; and &quot;nice way to sum it up&quot;.
&gt;
&gt;Wanna know what grade she got?...She made dad proud! A! :-)
&gt;She would like to thank all the wonderful &quot;westy&quot; folks out there that
&gt;helped with pics, info, urls, etc, along with moral support!
&gt;
&gt;A very special thankyou from Sarah, my 11 yr. old daughter, to the following
&gt;&quot;special&quot; people: (with a supporting class of people like them...how could
&gt;she not get an A)&lt;g&gt;
&gt;
