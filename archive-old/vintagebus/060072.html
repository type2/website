Subject: Re: [VB] Transport companies

That's what I think I'll do first thing Monday morning. I came to this conclusion after a whole day
of thinking. Changing the company will not do anything good... it will cost even more. I'll lose the
$200.00 and on top of that start looking for new carrier and it all might take extra time and extra
money. I can't just simply cancel and call my credit company . . . .these guys were wise and only
wanted MO full amount.... stupid me I FedExed it the next day. I admit it..... it's my own fault and
I don't blame all small businesses for this.... I also own one myself. Truth is people should look
at more aspects other than the low price. I almost hired a company from NY and even gave them a
deposit using my Credit Card..... stupid me I canceled with them and hired somebody else.... and the
price was higher only $100.00....... they gave my deposit back with no problem.

For now, I'll send them the extra $200.00 and see what they'll do. At least now we know not to use
these guys or pay the extra money for &quot;Express Service&quot;.

Thanks all for suggestions and remarks,

I'll keep you posted,

| Hi Andre,
| Hate to say it . . .but it looks like you should pay the $200 extra, and
| write it off to experience.  If the guy you bought the bus from needs to get
| it off his property - you don't really have a choice.
|
| Also sounds like you'll spend more than the extra $200 in phone calls, lost
| time at work, worry, etc, etc, etc.
|
| You don't really have much of a choice.
