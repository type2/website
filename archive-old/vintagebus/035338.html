***All for a 67 Kombi. 12v***

OK I tore into the dash on the bus today and here is what I found:

    Very Dirty connections at the ignition switch, headlight switch and fuse 
box
    Broken Connection at Ignition switch
    Missing the fuse box clip (fuse box hangs)

This is what I did:

    Cleaned
    Soldered the broken terminal
    Cleaned again   
    Zip tied the fuse box until I get the right clip
    Cleaned some more
    Checked the fuse box for bad connections
    Checked the taillight wiring
    Checked connections at battery and alternator and starter
    Checked for any grounds and nothing

Here is some more info on the problem.  
    The gen light glows.  
    I have a 12v internal reg. Alternator.
    I have a Pioneer Tape deck which had NO problems in the 5 years ive had it
    Main lead into fuse box (far right) heats up along with the fuse
    Stereo turns off when I turn on the headlights, t-signals, 4-ways, 
brights or hit the      brakes


So any ideas on what im missing??
