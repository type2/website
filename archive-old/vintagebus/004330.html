I thinks it's cool that he's looking to get one. He seems to be looking for
a resto custom bus already done. I'm sure he will pay someone good money for
it too !

I really do not think that fellow VW people will mind. And if they do then
they need to get a life.

What about the thousands of OG buses that went to Japan with the Japanese
doing all kinds of sh--t to them ? They've done more to drive the prices up
then anyone one celebrity.

I personally thought it was cool.

&gt; &lt;&lt; Well OCTO came and went with one great find. Eddie Van Halen! He showed
&gt;  up looking to buy a bus and seemed determined to buy the right one.
&gt;  Everyone around at one point went crazy and I will have pics up in the
&gt;  morning of the whole show so you'll just have to wait. How cool is that!
&gt;  Eddie Van Halen driving a 23 window! He's got taste. &gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Oh great!! Maybe he will buy a nice one owner orig paint bus and paint it
&gt; like his f'n guitar!! And this is the last thing the bus community needs,
&gt; when buses get popular, the fun goes away. Why does he want a bus now,
cause
&gt; Sienfeld has one?
