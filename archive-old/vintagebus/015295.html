Subject: Trade corner glass for Washer bottle??
Mime-Version: 1.0
X-MIME-Autoconverted: from quoted-printable to 8bit by lenti.type2_dot_com id DAA34100

Ok..There must be someone out there with a spare washer bottle w/pump!! I
would like to trade one piece of corner glass or buy a working unit. I will
also consider buying just a working pump. Last week someone mentioned a place
with NOS pumps??? Any leads would be appriciated.
Thanks
Michael
