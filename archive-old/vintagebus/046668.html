Hi Steve,
What you really need to do then is to cut/trim a piece of stiff cardboard to 
act as a template.  Just model it off a section of your truck bed that is not 
dented/damaged.  Body shops that do real body work have a multiple layered 
tool that conforms to the body form in question and then these layers can be 
locked so as to use this templated info on the other side of the automobile.
