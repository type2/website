I first became aware of names for autos from my mother.  She called every 
car &quot;Betsy&quot;.  She talked to her cars like they were her best friends.  My
first car, a '56 Ford, was &quot;George&quot;.  I don;t know where the name came from
it was just there, maybe the mocho thing.  George was my first car.  I had
several cars after that including a '68 Bus  (I got it in Sept. of '67 one
of the few new wrap around styles around)  and none of them had names.  They
were just pieces of steel with wheels that got me from here to there and
they were short lived, no love.  In July of 1975 I bought a '57 single cab.
It had belonged to the neighbor behind me.  The back gate was missing and
replaced with a heavy wooden one.  The Stones 'Flying Lips and Tongue' logo
was  painted square in the middle.  After I took ownership and climbed  into
the drivers seat for the first time, like a flash of lighting a name hit me.
&quot;Louise&quot;          It was love.  This was Louise.

Louise and I have been together almost 25 years now and we've been through a
lot of adventures.  She has challanged me with her problems and I gave her
mine and we've both survived.  On our 20th anniversary I started giving her
a compleat make over.  Top to bottom, Front to back, inside and out.  She's
almost done and she seems to stand a little taller, a little prouder and a
lot stronger.  When I got ready to paint her my first reaction was to give
her orginal color back, Dove Blue, (she was painted a dirty white when I got
her).  Well the paint went on and the energy died.  The color sucked and
everybody that look at her just shook their heads, puke.  So I sat inside
and said what color do you want to be and leaned back and listened, kind of
like talking to the wife or girlfriend.  Well I know you think this is crazy
but images started to form and the colors started to come together.  She's
going to be two tone, a medium brown base with a cream yellow uppercab and
&quot;V&quot; nose with black bumpers and wheels.  Soon we'll be together again on the
road with places to go, people to see and a new set of adventures to look
forward to.

My whole point to this ramblin' is &quot;There is no name if there is no love.&quot;

Happy Trails
From John and Louise

If it's worth doing, it's worth doing
yourself.
