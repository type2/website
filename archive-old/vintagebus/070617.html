Subject: Re: [VB] Oil cooler question

&gt; &gt; I have been replacing or putting back the rubber seals on the doghouse
&gt; &gt; tin and also gluing back on a foam strip on the back of the cooler to
&gt; &gt; help seal and keep the tin from leaking air.

&gt; No, it's not a matter of leaky tin or something that is the reason for low
&gt; airflow. It just doesn't flow much air past the cooler period. There's no
&gt; problem to fix, this is just how much airflow VW designed to have go past
&gt; the oil cooler.

&gt; Anyway, the oil doesn't (shouldn't) need that much cooling if the engine
is
&gt; setup right and VW knew that. I think that's where I was going with
&gt; this........

I would like to make sure my engine is set up right. Does anyone have a
checklist or another helpful way for us to know that the engine has all the
stuff to make it not overheat?

TIA,

Dave
