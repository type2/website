You are absolutely right about this.  I saw the procedure in the Bently and 
tried it before installation.  Had I known that a working generator would 
run smooth and hum like a finely tuned electric motor, not lurch and sound 
like bug zapper on a summer night, I could have saved myself many hours of 
labor.
