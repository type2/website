I'm looking for a consensus (ha, outta this group) on what is *correct* for engine tin.  Obviously the engine tin was originally painted, so by powdercoating it that automatically rules out correct.  But aside from that, should the black be done in gloss or semi-gloss?  I've heard it both ways from numerous experts, so I threw everything out the window and decided to throw it to the list.

Gloss or Semi-Gloss, what say you?

Robert
