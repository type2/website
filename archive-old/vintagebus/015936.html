Subject: Any listees in St Augustine Fla area.

Hi all,
Just got a call from Mad Uncle Dave and he asked me to post this. He is camping 
in the St Augustine Beach, Fla KOA.  And asked if any one would like to stop by 
to visit him that would be super.  He is probably camping in the Burrito 
Express (brownish-yellow 70 dormobile), but if you see a blue/white 67 stop by 
also.

Peace Brothers and Sisters,
Snoopy
