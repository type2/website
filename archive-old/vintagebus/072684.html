Subject: Re: [VB] Anyone up for getting togetherSat night OCTO/Classic 
  Weekend?

&gt; &gt; Greetings all from sunny So Cal. I was thinking (That can be dangerous) 
&gt; &gt; since the OCTO/Classic weekend is upon us and alot of us here on the list 
&gt; &gt; will be in town for it(OK I live here)that possibly Saturday night we could 
&gt; &gt; pick a place and all meet up and have a lil grindage (food and drink) and 
&gt; &gt; meet one another? Anyone Game?
 
&gt; I'm game.  I am planning on doing the VTO fri. campout in Yucaipa, then 
&gt; heading to the OCTO show. I wasnt super thrilled with the Irvine Lake campout so I 
&gt; may skip out on that and maybe head to the beach to camp with my girls.
&gt; 
&gt; Beto

i am working on tidying up zapper in anticipation of taking off on tuesday and heading for the
campout in yucaipa and then to octo and probably the classic too.  i am easy to spot in my blue
and white dormobile with red and white tent, 2 dogs and a cat.  possibly even an 18 year old son!
