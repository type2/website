Subject: Re: [VB] Re: [WetWesties] 70  so44 dormobile

&gt; Hi Paul,
&gt; Congrats on the SO-44!  They are a great camper interior with the widest bed
&gt; availible.  We found this by searching for &quot;VW SO-44&quot;:
&gt; http://www.ev1.pair_dot_com/VW/SO44_1.html
&gt;   The interior should be very simular even though it is a 1967.

i never saw an original post so im assuming you cross posted this from
wetwesties.
but...

I thought that the bay non walkthrough interior which is in the small
poptop and westy/dormobile busses is designated as SO-69.
