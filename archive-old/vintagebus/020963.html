Subject: bumper stickers

Some bumper stickers are cool but I never put them
anywhere except on glass.  I think that some of the
old travel stickers from the 50s and 60s are awesome
and even add to the character of the bus.  I have some
stickers that I picked up in Sweden that I like.  It
is modeled after the Swedish elk crossing sign.  All
the German tourists have them plastered on the tails
of their cars.  I do not want to stir up the pot again
but another listee just sent some cool &quot;NONHIPPYBUS&quot;
stickers that I will proudly display.  Then of course
there is the obligatory &quot;D&quot; sticker that is a &quot;must
have&quot; for any ACVW.  So I think stickers can be neat
and add interest if tastefully done.

&gt; I have always refused to put bumper stickers on my
&gt; vehicles, especially my
&gt; double cab.  Not even a single OCTO stickers, though
&gt; I've been very tempted.
&gt; 
&gt; remember, it's the second amemdment that protects
&gt; the first.
