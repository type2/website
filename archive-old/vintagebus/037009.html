&lt;&lt; Any advice on what metal to use to patch a window sized hole in a panel
 bus? Can I obtain steel from the local metal place, or is it recommended to
 find a boneyard and make off with an appropriately sized chunk? Does the
 German steel make any difference? Thanks.
  &gt;&gt;
The best material to use is the same panel cut out of a junker bus.  If you
look carefully there is a curve in just about every part of the bus body and
using flat sheet metal will just cause problems if you want to make it look
like there was no repairs done there.  By the way the steel that VW used from
the 1950 through the 1970s was made in the USA.   Eric &amp; Barb
