The valves are supposed to sit even.
I thought of the possible scenarios that would cause this and pushrod flex
and bent valve sounds reasonable to me.  There are other things that could
cause the valve to not sit at the right height, but bent valve covers both
things.  If you were right on the edge of coil bind, which I wouldn't
think you would be, that lower one might cause it to bend the pushrod.
Maybe the seat needs cut down.  Check the other side to make sure all the
valves are even on that side too.  I'm thinking you'll have to pull that
head and take it back to the rebuilder to get done right.
