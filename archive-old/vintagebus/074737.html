Subject: Re: [VB] Re: Queen of all strange bus sounds

I understand what you say .. and true, I don't understand most of what I read.
It still boggles my mind as to how we get television, electricity for that
matter !!!
I can pretend that one day I will work on my bus .. but to tell the truth ..
It will
never happen.  I prefer to work doing something I KNOW HOW to do and enjoy,
make the money to pay someone to do what they know how and enjoy. [if any
sort of work is enjoyable for either of us.]

I was driving a brand new VW bug to Woodstock before getting discouraged by
the traffic and turned around, just to give you an idea how OLD I am .. I am
not
strong either ..  if I can't push it with my feet - the way I move furniture
when I
clean house, then I am sunk !!  And then there is the fear of taking something
apart and not being able to put it back together.  Or not having or being able
to
find parts .. There is SO much that I would need to know ..I could ** MAYBE **
figure out electric.

PS .. I know you will all cringe when I say this but ...... ... I HATE
GETTING
THAT DIRTY .. I know it comes off  ... I still can't stand it .. and can't
even
stand the smell of &quot;gunk.&quot;  I think that is what it is called.  You can wash
and
wash and still not get the grease out from under your nails for days ...
gloves
are out of the question ..

PPS ..  by the time I learned enough to not totally F up whatever it was I was
trying
to do, .. I will probably be too damn old to drive it ..

  At the risk of making you mad, I would venture that you have _read_
  the &quot;Idiot&quot; manual, but you don't _understand_ it yet.  To me, the
  premise of that manual is &quot;yes, you CAN do it yourself.&quot;
