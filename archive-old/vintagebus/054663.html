Subject: Re: [VB] Adjusting a H30/31 pict carb

A lot of overheating problems that can not be traced down to external influences are usually a result
of to high a CR.  Do you know who built your engine?  Did they do any CR calculation or adjustments
(barrel spacers, combustion chamber balancing, ect.)?  Just because you are using stock size P/C's and
stock heads does not mean you're running low enough CR.  When I calculated my CR on this totally stock
engine/heads, it came out to over 8.0CR!   Too high!   CC'ing the heads and them matching them to each
other, plus the addition of .060 shims under the cylinders brought me back down to 6.9CR.

My last motor had this same problem when the ext. temp rose.  I eventually killed it.  I'm pretty sure
its because when I slapped on the pistons and new heads I didn't bother to calc the CR.  Live and
learn.

&gt; This heating problem is still with us when the outside temp. is above
&gt; 85. We are running a 6 volt small generator pulley to help turn the fan
&gt; about 2.1 to 1 (stock is 1.6 to 1). This helps in cooling it down faster
&gt; (as required), when you idle and we do get better heating when we use
&gt; the heater.
&gt; We also have type 4 dog house cooler.
&gt; Maybe it is an ez camper problem (LOL) who knows?
&gt; We do run 47 to 53 mph to help kept temp down.
&gt; This summer we did not have a temp problem running around the north west
&gt; USA
&gt; Ours carb. is a new 'Brog'  pic 30 type we did increase our mileage with
&gt; this new carb but have not played with the jetting yet, so please share
&gt; if you find anything.
&gt; PS Rhone thinks we are wasting HP by turning the fan faster and we are
&gt; sure it does some.
