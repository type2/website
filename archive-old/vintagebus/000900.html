For those of you that long for a split single cab, I have run across a
gentleman here in Iowa City that has 2 that he is looking to find a good
home.  One is a 61 (chasis # 703XXX) and the other is a 64 (chasis #
6141XXX) I think.  The 61 was restored but has a body modification.  It has
been converted to 12 Volts, but has the 1200 engine.  The 64 was a project
that he didnt get started on.  He would like to sell them together if
possible.  Price is negotiable with him.  His contact information is:

Tom Kennedy
(319) 338-2330

Please contact him, not me concerning these vehicles.  If you are really
interested (ie have talked to him), live far away, and would like digital
pictures taken drop me an email and I'll take some digital ones.
