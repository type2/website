 I think she said those were 36hp, but a small ovaling of the mounting hole
 would fix them to work on the later models.

Some body at the dealer they came out of had written 36hp on the box.  The 
are the A version of the p/n, which supoerceded to plain version as being 
sold for 36hp motors, as well as sold on (i believe) the later stale air 
motors.   The version I have has the complete rectangle around the themostat, 
rather than a C shape.  The stale air thermostat is adjusted at the air 
doohickey in front of the fan.   The later (fresh air motors) have the 
thermostat adjusted by raising or lowering the thermostat bracket where it is 
attached to the engince case.  Thus the ones degned for the fresh air system 
have an oval hole, so you can raisethe bracket up and down, while the stale 
air ones came with a circular hole.  One thing when installing the thermosta 
flaps you should check is on the side where the vertiocal rod goes through 
down the the thermostat, often it has gotten pushed back up, so you should 
make sure to bend it back if it has been squashed down, or you will have an 
improperly adjusted thermostat.  This is scientifically done by prying with a 
largish screwdriver till the spacing is about that of the width of a popsicle 
stick.

seems the hard parts of the system to find are the vertical rod, and the 
doghouse style horizontal linkage.      One thing I like about the 68 and 
later right side flap is the piece sticking towards the back of the motor for 
the thermostatically operated air cleaner pre heat.  a cable runs from that 
to the air cleaner, and when thermostat is closed (cold) you ONLY get air 
from the preheat section of the aircleaner.   I want to hook this up on my 
camper, which means finding a cable, and modifying my aircleaner.
