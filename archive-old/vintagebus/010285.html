There were Dormobile conversions on VW vans that were &quot;full&quot; Dormobile
conversions.  All interior arrangements were installed by Dormobile in
England and they had the &quot;Patented Martin Walter folding roof&quot;.

There were also Westfalia converted vans that were equipped with the Martin
Walter/Dormobile folding roof, installed by Westfalia in Germany under
license from Dormobile.

There were Westfalia conversions that had a Dormobile folding roof installed
in England, either arranged by the English dealer pre-sale or by the new
owner post-sale.

And probably an infinite number of variations on these primary themes.

&gt;&gt; I thought Dormobile and Westfalia were mutually exclusive conversions...
