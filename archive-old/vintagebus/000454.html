Bob,

I think you're probably right.  My 1961 Flip-seat Westy has an m-code of 347 
which I don't find listed, but it must be a group of codes (like m-367) 
because there are things about the flip-seat camper which aren't covered by 
the rest of the codes.  For example, the front left pop-out is installed 
backwards (hinge on the front) from every other pop-out I've ever seen except 
on SO-34's.
