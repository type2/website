Subject: Re: [VB] Funny Ads

there were more funny ads in the past and I'm sure that if you start checking right now I bet you
can find errors and misspelled words in almost every ad.... I know since I have been in the market
for a little while. Stuff about &quot;rust in usual places&quot;, &quot;95% original&quot; or &quot;Volkswagon&quot; don't really
make me laugh anymore.... eBay scares me though.... people would list a Bug in the Bus section with
title &quot; 1967 VW Bus Bug for sale&quot; - what? not really sure what it is? - or a 1972 Ford Camper Van
with title &quot;1972 Volkswagen Van&quot; as we've seen noted here just yesterday. Why wouldn't people use
spell check? Usually when I write descriptions I use Word and then just copy and paste text.... to
avoid laughs..... but that's just me.... some people don't care.

peace,

Dre

I like the people who say &quot;usual Bus rust&quot;.  Uh, I'm used to no rust, so
it's perfect, right?
