Subject: Re: [VB] type3 cooler
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

well, I don't actually collect porsche oil coolers,  and I don't even know 
what a Sea-Trab is,  (sounds like an airport) let alone where to find a 
cooler for one.  Do you have pictures?   I have seen a Porsche cooler that 
looks like a 25hp/early 36hp VW cooler, the round topped one.  and an upright 
cooler that is finned like a doghouse.  I believe they were used with forced 
air, if the air from the fan is what you are calling forced air.    Is that 
what you were talking about?   And regardless of how much a chromed P&amp;C set 
for a porsche costs, (or what it cost when new)  the point is how do the oil 
coolers cool, comparatively, on our VWs.   meaning before and after numbers 
on the same motor.  now it has an upright, now a TightFinned Type III 
Doghouse, or now a type I dog, then the TFTypIIID.  Or compare it with the 
type IV dog, be really interesting.    It is nice to throw ideas around, 
though.    I mean, I thought the type IV concept made sense, and decided to 
try it out, and the engine then ran cooler. (5-10*C when warmed up) over a 
type I doghouse, and the oil temp dropped quicker when I got off the freeway. 
  I like hearing others' results too.  if you can get a similar effect from 
theTFTypIII cooler, without the engine tin mods, that could be neat.    But 
why did VW not put them on the bugs and later Type IIIs if they were better?  
 air flow?  was the TF ones the earlier ones? maybe the wider ones are 
better?  I don't know.  I've heard you mention these for over a year, but 
where are the data?

 911 Porsche or even better a 64 356 Carrera Porsche, or even better a 
 Sea-Trab oil cooler. ALL of these have the same fin placement as the tight 
 finned type 3 oil cooler. They are also useing these to cool WITHOUT forced 
 air, Think about it. The cars (engines) that use these types of coolers have 
 more money in a couple of parts in there engines then our whole upright 
 engine would cost new!  &gt;&gt;
 
 Hi Ronnie,
 Interesting to hear!  How do they get the cooling air through the cooler 
 without forced air?  Maybe the tighter fins work better with the Porsche 
 non-forced air cooling of the cooler and not as well with the VW forced air 
 system?  We know a good bit about the late 50s early 60s 356s, but not later 
 Porsches.  Porsche relied also on much more and bigger fins on the heads and 
 cylinders where most of the heat is created.  Perhaps this allowed Porsche 
to 
 use a smaller cooler?  Interestingly VW came out a year before Porsche did 
 with the IRS suspension!  Yes, the lowly inexpensive bug and Ghia suddenly 
 handled better than that year expensive Porsche!
 
  &lt;&lt;This is an argument that can go on forever, but we should have real 
 numbers in the next couple weeks as there are now 4 people here in 110 
degree 
 Havasu with or in the process of using the tight finned type 3 cooler. &gt;&gt;
 
 We would not call all this an argument, just a disscussion.  There have been 
 many a time we thought of trying something, but at second, third or fourth 
 time talking about it with other VW nuts like us and reading manual after 
 manual we would figured/found out why it was not such a good idea.  Testing 
 with gauges is the ultimate for figuring out which parts and methods work 
 best and we have done so several times.  IE blocking off the fresh air tubes 
 to the heat exchangers is a bad idea!   We look forward to seeing how your 
 testing goes.  Would be great if you were to try the the type 4 cooler on 
the 
 same engines for more testing.
