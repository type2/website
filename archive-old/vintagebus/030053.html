Subject: RE: Birthdays

Our bus was born  Jan. 30 1951  supposedly the day Porsche died.  But there is some
confusion to that date--Non the less its still a &quot;youngster&quot; -- as i was born Dec. 17,
1935.
PS:  Please, all of you keep working, as i really need that Social Security check.
PPS:  If you ad my age and the age of our bus--you get the age of dirt!
Thanks, TWWM, uj
