Subject: German car club

Hi all,
        A friend of mine has a bumper plaque from a German car club. The
best I can read, yeah, yeah I'm getting old, because of the Olde German
script is &quot;Im Darmstadt&quot; which I can loosely manuever to &quot; in or of
Darmstadt ( the city)&quot; The plaque shows a red bug in front of a castle with
two towers and a blue sky behind the castle. Any help on where this came
from and what the rest of the Olde German scripte says?
        Thanks
        Mike - 67 Deluxe ( once the vanagon goes, this becomes THE VW in
the house )
