&gt;I know there's no magic cure, but I'm curious as to what's
&gt;toasted: bearing?  Gear?  I'm guessing the bearings that
&gt;first rides on are toast, but aren't they common with second?

What you are hearing is a worn 1st gear in a non-syncro 1st
split case tranny.  the 1st gear is straight-cut instead of
helical-cut and makes a scary noise when worn.

Get used to it...  my early 1959 single cab had this sound
when I bought it, and I have put about 100k miles on it since
then.  Mine sounds like shaking a coffee can full of wrenches,
but it keeps going &amp; going...
