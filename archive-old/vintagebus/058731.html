Subject: Priceless tool  ..  Re: ?????????????????????????????????????????????????????


The only help I could possible offer him would be what I just said, do it 
yourself and not depend on others.  No worries.  Sorry to hear of your bad 
experience with this crowd.  They have been nothing but helpful to me.  
There is no other way I can think of to get quick responses to questions 
that I may have in the restoration of my vert and busses. Almost like a 
priceless tool in my box.  No matter how dumb or important the question may 
be, someone answers up.  Time is short for all of us and anything helps.  As 
for the business end of things, selling or buying, I stick to the 
appropriate tools for that.  Erape, thesamba, swaps.  Not neccessarily in 
that order.

&gt;&lt;&lt; You know, I have been sitting back for the last year reading about your
&gt;  continuous problems with this car and &quot;its&quot; mechanics/restorers.  That is
&gt;  the number two reason why I do *all* my work on my cars, from mechanical 
&gt;to
&gt;  the vert top and paint (minus machine work).  The number one reason is
&gt;  satisfaction of doing the work myself.  I figure I am way ahead of the $$
&gt;  game if I go out and buy all the quality tools it takes to do the work
&gt;  myself and just do it.  Some don't have time, but I work full time and 
&gt;then
&gt;  some, as most do. Just takes a little more time to get it completed,
&gt;  definitely not your case as your guys are not producing.  Not having the
&gt;  knowledge to do the work themselves is no excuse, &gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;


  Nice thought very commendable and well meaning too, but if you have been
&gt;paying attention you will notice your's is precisely the type of response
&gt;which has been posted by myself and others numerous times and if truth be
&gt;known  Don G. craves, so yes your points are valid but will most surely 
&gt;fall
&gt;on deaf ears... Humor him and offer help if you dare.. ;-)
&gt;  As for me I hardly say anything here in this forum because after two + 
&gt;years
&gt;of answering questions and giving away VW parts for little or nothing and
&gt;using my corporate discounts to help others in the end I finally received 
&gt;the
&gt;shit end of the stick...The actions of the few taint the entire 
&gt;thing........
