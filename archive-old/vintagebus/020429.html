Subject: Beto's starter-was death of list?
To: Type2Guy_at_aol_dot_com
Cc: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

If Beto put that self supporting auto starter into the
stash pile please send it back to Phoenix! I have a
friend who lent/donated/sold/foisted that starter on
me during a marathon rebuild and install of the tranny
that is currently in the 63EZ. I have repaid that debt
about ten times yet still get to hear &quot;mandatory&quot; sh*t
about at everyturn in the road.
Death of the list? I figure seasonal busy schedules,
the heat, out driving the buses if you still own one
and general burn out.

Our family is without bus until I turn enough tricks
to afford the steering box and front end rebuild. I
guess the list goes &quot;Dead&quot; when I'm not around to piss
people off and create flame bait.
Flame bait? OK, how about that comment from the guy
who posted a collage of barndoors on Thoms website
encouraging folks to &quot;Come on people! Spend some
money!&quot; Is the economy slowing down? Perhaps I was
just ahead of the curve in my Barndoor sales
adventure. It looks like it's other peep's turns. If
the economy isnt slowing down then why is everyone
selling the last individual pitty-pat item out of
their garages on eBarf and on the two main vw sites?
Sales of  rat sawzall test buses seem to be on the up
swing.
For sale: rusted bent and greasy single port tin -
$100. &quot;rare&quot;.  Also noticed the same type of upper
front splitty bus window frames that I literally gave
away &lt; pile of them! &gt; to get off of my property being
offered for stupid money. Westy coat hooks for $25 and
$50? Get the F out! I gave one of those away to the
window frame and starter guy on general principles. He
wanted it and I gave it to him. No regrets- he's a
friend.
Oh well I definitely am glad to be in JAFO mode for
the time being. I have to go check the A/C in the
F150. Actually the A/C in the Land Cruiser is colder.
