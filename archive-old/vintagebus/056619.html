&lt;&lt; I've seen Euro splittie SO42/44's with the earlier tents and brackets. 
 There was a gentleman at OCTO (one before last) that was an original owner
 of one he picked up and use in Europe before coming home.  It had a yellow
 and gray privy tent but I've seen them with the full tents too.
 
 BTW Most Euro campers were two tone painted and usually did not have the
 crank out windows like the US or even the Tourist US versions did.   Usless
 drivel I know.

my 65 S0-42 westy was sold in Germany special ordered with US lighting, US 
bumpers  and miles speedo.- this off the M code plate.  ( PPO was military, 
may have been OO)  It came two tone (has original colours back on it now), 
and with 4 fixed side windows and two popouts (one in the closet so I can air 
my clothes while driving).  It also had 4 tent mounts on the roof and the 
front bumper tent mount, though the tent was MIA.  Not the later style 
slider, tbut the brackets, and the corresponding holes in the jack points on 
the pass side for the lower attachment of the little tent.
