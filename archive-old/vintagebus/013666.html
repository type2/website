&gt; Bear with me, I know numbers are boring. Just for the books, my
&gt; chassis number starts with 235, 2 = Type 2, 3 = Kombi/camperwagen
&gt; and the 5, I am to understand means the '5' in 1965.  The rest of
&gt; the number is 076 845.

So, it's 235.076.845.

&gt; My Splitty DVLC owners document says it's a 73 or a 78 (can't
&gt; remember *:-) ) Kombi 7 seater.  I phoned VW in Milton Keynes

It's wrong.

&gt; asking for the production date and they sent me a letter saying
&gt; &quot;we are writing to confirm that your vehicle was manufactured
&gt; 18th December 1964.  Finally, VW in Wolfsburg received my 10Dm
&gt; and returned a certificate saying that it was built on 16th
&gt; December 1964 and left the factory 6 days later on the 22nd.

They're both right, probably on all counts.

&gt; How the hell can this be? - the chassis number says it's a late
&gt; '65, the registration plate says it's a '65. So who's wrong? and
&gt; do I now just give up as everyone that should know the facts
&gt; disagree with each other, and all seem to be a year out?

First, it's a 1965 model, because of the '5' in the 3rd digit.
The 1965 model run began in July 1964.  The December dates just
make is a middle-of-the-model-year 1965 model.  I have in the
NEATO Old Bus Registry chassis number 225.076.361 made on 16
December 1964.  Yours would have been in the plant at about the
same day.  Also, the last 1965 I know of is 225.174.370, made on
1 July 1965, 100,000 buses later.  Yours is &quot;mid-year.&quot;

The sure fire way to check is to look at the Production Plate
behind the right front seat on the bulkhead.  For your bus, the
first line should read

16 D
or
18 D

That would be for 16 December or 18 December.  I wrote an article
for NEATO's Old Bus Review a while back on this issue.  I
basically said they start the bus on the 16th, put a tag on it,
and they finish it on the 18th and record that date in their
books.  It may very well have been shipped out a week or a month
later, so the shipping date can vary.

I'd love to have the rest of your Production Plate information
to add to the Registry.  Pass it along if you can.
