Since he obviously has plenty of money to spend on useless things, such as incredibly higher
insurance, how about we hit him up for paying our cheap insurance?  It would probably take 5 or 6
of ours to even come close to his one.

I'm happy that he's happy with his SUV!  He can go on driving the thing, for all I care.  If
that's what keeps his mop flopped, then so be it.  He can give up the VW van, as he has done, and
we'll be more than happy to drive it.  The only thing that SUV owners bother me with is in the
higher insurance premiums and quite possibly, higher petrol prices, in my area that I must pay for
their mistakes. Just the thought, though, of seeing the SUV driving soccer moms backing into
little kids, during their cross-parking-lot 4-wheel drive adventures that they must risk life and
limb for, is enough to make me laugh out loud.

As far as an example... I am putting forth one, as I'm sure many on this list are, by driving what
I want to drive.  What gives him the right??

WEBSTER DEFINES IT AS SUCH...
The SUV: The Castor Oil of the automotive community.  A farce by name, ability, agility, and/ or
ruggedness.  Usually seen, teetering, stuck on top of high concrete curbs in an otherwise empty
parking lot and also stranded alongside any major highway with rear suspension and tires broken
and popped, accordingly, from obvious inability to read load weight capacities, with it's owner
pacing outside with a cell-phone in hand, cussing out the AAA. (Antonym: anything to do with
reality)

&gt; &quot;Give SUVs a break.
&gt; I find the furor that many anti-SUV Kuddites bring up to the most amusing,
&gt; as are the many &quot;facts&quot; that they pull out of the air to prove how
&gt; deleterious a sport utility vehicle will be on Earth. Well, excuse me for
&gt; living.
&gt; I used to drive an early 1970's Volkswagen van, not unlike some of the aging
&gt; relics seen even now around the Willamette Valley. I've enjoyed the economy
&gt; of movement, not to mention the acceleration, these vehicles employ.
&gt; My point? The SUV I own now has comparable, if not better, gas mileage than
&gt; the old clunker had. Even when I gave my VW van the best tune up I could
&gt; give it, drove with a tail wind and kept it unloaded, its mileage was not
&gt; better than my much reviled current vehicle.
&gt; Only now, I have the option of having my feet warm and keeping the
&gt; windshield defrosted on a cold day. I can accelerate much better now, thank
&gt; you very much.
&gt; So, for all those blowhards who are constantly whining about the evils of
&gt; SUVs, get a life! Get rid of your clunky Volkswagens. Put forth an example.&quot;
