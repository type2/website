Subject: 23 window deluxe

Hello all,

    I need to get an idea of the value of a 1963, 23 window deluxe bus.
I
have looked around on the internet and been to several sites, but very
little info. was available on the value of these cars.  I turn now to
you guys.  The
bus is complete, a little rust, some dings, and a cracked window.  I
don't know much else.  83,000 miles, and original paint that looks nice.

Any info would be greatly appreciated!!

Thank you for your time,
Chris Russow
