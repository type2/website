&gt; &gt; &lt;&lt; &gt;&gt;Normal Looking to blast, prime and paint rims soon. Is the backside,
&gt; 
&gt; You may want to consider hot tanking them. I was able to get all 5 wheels
&gt; for my 57 hot tanked for about the same cost as having only the face of each
&gt; wheel sand blasted.
&gt; 

I think I'll do this next set of rims I have done.  All the ones I've
blasted get grit wedged in between the spokes and the outer rim.   Takes
hours with a dental pic to remove some you never get!
