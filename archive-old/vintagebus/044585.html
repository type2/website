Hi everyone,

I'm sure this topic will be going on for the next few days before and after
this Sunday.
But since there probably will be quite a few list members coming into town for
the show, I'm sure we will run into some of them.

For those coming into town keep an eye out for my 63 15 window deluxe.
Turquoise and white walk-thru.
Should be parked in the spectator parking near the show car area.
I'll be with my brother Everett who'll be in from Phoenix, so if there are any
of you other barndoor people around you can come over and talk with him.

Good luck in searching for parts and busses
