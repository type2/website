&lt;&lt; Finally a solution to the starter problem that has dogged me since the
 engine rebuild. The starter bushing I installed while the engine was out
 over the winter is the culprit. &gt;&gt;
Hi John,
When you installed the starter with the new bushing did you make sure to
grease the inside of the bushing or apply some grease to the starter tip that
goes into the bushing?  If not the bushing will wear and fail much sooner
than later.  Eric&amp;Barb
