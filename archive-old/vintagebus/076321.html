Subject: Re: [VB] Re: Metal brake line length

2 inches short won't work. You can get 2 lengths that equal 22 inches and
connect them together with a female-female or male-male connector.

&gt;I am a cheap S.O.B.! Therefore I hate paying shipping costs on parts.

IMHO: There are lots of better places to cheap out on your Bus parts
than on the brakes...

&gt;Anyway, my FLAPS has metal brake lines that are 20 inches long in stock.

Do they have the right flare on the ends?  See
http://volksweb.relitech_dot_com/brakeln.htm (linked from the Type2 library)
for info.
