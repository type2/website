as far as i know that is a seam sealer...i tried putting some of this on last
year, after scraping all the old stuff out, and using naval jelly on the bare
metal, then covering in Corroless(somewhat like por-15 I think).

Anyway i didn't realize until after i started putting it on, that it doesn't
go on too smoothly, and I wasn't sure how to smooth it out. It also reacted to
the corroless, I gues it had not completely cured.

Anyway I plan on trying it again in sometime in the next couple of weeks(if i
have time) I talked to a friend who works in a body shop place, and he told me
that there is a self leveling product, which would work much better for this
application, just squeeze it on, with this gun like device(kind of like a
caulking gun) and then it slef levels while curing.

If i get to it this summer I'll let you all know how it turns out.
