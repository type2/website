&lt;&lt; While looking at my brother's 58 euro westy, I noticed 2 cables mounted 
near
 the heat control knob.  I am guessing 1 is for the fuel tap and 1 is for the
 choke? &gt;&gt;
Hi Danno,
Correct!  We have found a ZVW part kit to convert 40HP and later carbs to use 
the choke cable, and get rid of the automatic choke!  More recently we have 
found a Brazilain carb that looks like a 30PICT-1 but has the 36 HP style 
choke cable parts on it's left side.  Someone ground off all of it's part 
numbers though.  Will be installing this latter part on our 1960 panel 
conversion with SP 1641cc engine to see if it will work at all.  Then 
hopefully soon will install new choke cable, and drill holes through the fan 
housing, and front tin.  Manual choke here we come!  Eric&amp;Barb
