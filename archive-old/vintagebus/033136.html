 Hi All,
   Am I correct in assuming that a Type 2 crank handle is different than a
 Type 1? Is the bolt the same? Should the handle have any markings? and
 finally, does anyone re-pop them? &gt;&gt;

the difference is length.

through 53 the handle is shorter (no bumper on bus)
 54 they were longer to clear the bumper. this 54-59 version is most common.
a bug ( through 49) handle is even longer.

the same nut was used bug &amp; bus, that part of the handle is the same.


have seen one home modified longer to fit past the home made tow hitch on the 
bus.
