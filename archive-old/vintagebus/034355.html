I have used an adjustable reamer
and found it a little 'risky' cos you're working
right on the bottom end of the adjustment
(adjustment is 21-23 mm on mine)...

I have used a brake master cylinder hone
(goes in yer drill) with great success and it is now
my preferred method for honing the bushings.

It takes a bit longer but you just hone to a nice tight fit!

&gt; &gt; I'm looking to do a re-bush on my swing lever. I checked out the type2
&gt; &gt; library and found an article about the procedure. The author (whose name
&gt; &gt; evades me at the moment, my apologies) did not find it necessary to use
&gt; &gt; the reamer in his successful installation.
&gt; 
&gt; gotta use it on the splits, not on the bays....
&gt; 
&gt; I used an adjustable reamer from a set my boss had.  they might have
&gt; something at the shop you can use, or maybe someones buddy..
