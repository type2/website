Subject: FS: Carb Govenor for early bus....  $3000 ?
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

Got one, but not for that much.  I remember someone once ask me for one, and 
I found one in a box tonight.  Took it off a early bus that had sat since 
1971.  Started right up with a little coaxing....  I found a carb plate with 
a vacume line I think may go to it, was in the same box.  Do you know??   
Once someone said they were worth $100....... and once someone told me $20.  
I put $40 on it.  You tell me.  Anyways see the following for a pic.
