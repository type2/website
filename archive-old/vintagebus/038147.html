&lt;&lt;  have just bought a 1960 Kombi truck.  Looking for the back sides and I 
guess you would call it the tail gate.  I have the sides but they are very 
rusty.  Is there repair panels? I'm also looking for a bench seat, it doesn't 
have anything.  I live in Orlando Florida any help would be great.
