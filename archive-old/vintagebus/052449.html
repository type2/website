Subject: Re: [VB] Broken needle on fuel gauge

NB the bezel isn't too happy about being pried off and then trying to put =
it backon - it is apt to split/crack. IMHO it would be simpler and less =
stressful too look for a good used guage for about $40.00. The needle =
should also prove to be a Royal PITA to try and take off/replace.

 Does anyone have any idea how to &quot;open&quot; up a fuel gauge (12 volt)?  A =

 dropped his and the needle broke.  He had just purchased it and open the =

 and to the ground it fell.  Any help would be appreciated.
  &gt;&gt;
you turn it over and carefully pry up the edge of the metal that holds =
the=20
glass on the cup.  Ya the chrome, so be really careful or you'll bugger =
it=20
up.  Then the chrome bezel and glass will come off, and the gasket =
between=20
glass.bezel and the cup will come apart in a bunch of pieces and be a pain =
to=20
put back together.  Now you have the glass off, what'll you do, glue it=20
together?   Is this a special fuel guage?
