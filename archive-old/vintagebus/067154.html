Subject: 67 turn signal switch (TSS)

Hi. I have a problem with my TSS. I have 2 NOS TSS's, the correct part # 
according to VW manual EXCEPT they are the Euro version. This version DO NOT 
have the two wires from the TSS for the brake lights. In order to make these 
versions work on a US model is to replace the rear taillight housings with 
euro styles. These have TWO bulbs not 1 like US. The second bulb is for the 
Brake light only. I have been told I need to run new wires from the brake 
master cyl. to the euro light housings to get these to work with the euro 
TSS. Fine I will do that. I have no RT turn signal and suspect the TSS. It 
works with the four way flasher so its not a ground somewhere I don't think. 
Any info on this would be appreciated. I need to find 2 decent euro housings. 
Any info would help. Thanks

Ken
