Wow, I guess EB has hit the big time! For those of you just joining 
us, EveryBus is April 20-22 at Hagen Stone park in Greensboro, NC. 
The event is open to all VW Transporters. Among the general camping 
fun there will be a chilli cooking contest, door prizes, and a 
caravan to the IVWA swap meet in Farmington, NC on Sunday. Camping is 
$12 per nite per bus. Hook ups are available on a first come first 
serve basis - about 35 sites with water and electric are available. 
There is room for at least 120 and buses. Last year we had 80! For 
more details visit the website at http://www.mindspring_dot_com/~ncbus/ 
or email me.

Thanks and see you there:)

PS, the campground has really flush toilets and hot showers and about 
the cleanest bathhouse I have seen at a campground.

&gt;  Cool ,,VW trends has EveryBus and Also High Country Bus Festival listed in
&gt;their 2001 events planner. Bout time us East Coasters got some notice,,grin
&gt;,,all in fun folks, later
