Subject: Re: [VB] Ride Height.

I pulled some bars out of a '74 Super Beater this weekend and both sides 
were marked with a &quot;R&quot; and &quot;L&quot;.  So I would agree that they are not 
interchangable left to right due to the &quot;pre-stress&quot;.

Take Care,
Adrian Pillow


was writ:

My Bentley (for bays, but the torsion bar design is the same on splittys)
has a statement that reads:

---------------------------
CAUTION:
Torsion bars are prestressed in their working direction.  If both rear
torsion bars have been removed you must be careful not to interchange them
from one side of the vehicle to the other.  The left bar has an L on its
outer face; the right bar has an R.  [italic] If the bars are installed on
the wrong side, they will break when placed in service.[end italic]
