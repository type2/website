Subject: Re: [VB] Snow Bus

I think the funniest part of this is that Buffalo, NY
has not gotten a single dusting of snow yet!  First
time in recorded history that Western New York has not
gotten any snow during the month of November.  That
probably just means winter will go into May or
something!

&gt; Funny thing is it'll be short sleeve weather on
&gt; Friday. You know what 
&gt; they say...if you don't like the weather in
&gt; Texas...wait....it'll 
&gt; change.
