&lt;&lt; After raising it to stock the bus is still extremely pidgeon toed. The

couldn't have raised it too high in the rear. I have driven it and that 
didn't help. &gt;&gt;
Hi Bill,
For all stock swing axle VWs this is the norm when no load is in the VW and 
not helped when the stock interior is removed.  So install the stock interior 
or even a camper/Westie interior which is heavier, tools and spare parts will 
help lower it naturally.  If you have a SO or a compleat family adding them 
on board will definitely help.  If it turns out you are not going to do any 
of this, taking it down a notch in the rear would probably a good idea.
