 Hey fellow listees
 I have a question for all of the experts out there..
 What solutions have any of you found to reduce the
 wind noise/whistle from the wing windows?? My 67 Bus
 gets so loud that I have to slightly open the window
 to make it go away, and, this being winter and I live
 at five thousand feet elevation, ITS COLD.
 Anyone with good ideas?
 
 Thanks.... &gt;&gt;

let me guess- your latches are broken, if so, fix them.

I replaced the upright little piece in the frame that the raear side of the 
vent wings seals against and it helped my bus

try pushiung the front corner of the vent wing while driving if this makes 
the whistle go away,  you may want to carefully bend the tab the vent latch 
latches to so as to get a snugger fit.  Just a bit, and test for a whistles 
again.  BTDT.
