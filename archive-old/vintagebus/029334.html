Subject: Re: [VB] Another frickin' engine pull 

I'm sure you know a lot more about engines now than you did before you
started your project... I've been messin' around with VW's for 20 years,
but had never built an engine from the crank up till recently. Now when
I look at a book about engine building, it makes a lot more sense to me.
Even the real subtle, seemingly esoteric stuff.

So the time and money you've spent was not just for a running bus, it
was also for the learnin' ya got... Feel better?

BTW, there are things I wish I'd've done on my engine, and I'll remember
them for the next engine I build (pretty soon!)...
