Sorry to miss all the friends that were at Prescott,
but I decided to go to VW's on the Green in Littleton,
Colorado.

Boy, you guys complain about a little rain.  Barry and
I woke up to 2 inches of snow this morning.  Almost
couldn't get out of our camping site up the hill! 
Thanks for the reports on Prescott.

As for the recent oil temp thread, I had my new (250
miles) 1776 in my '61 Westy, towing my new singlewheel
trailer (serial number 04), and experienced
interesting oil temps and fuel mileage numbers.  The
engine is a new case, new big valve heads, new P&amp;C's,
counterbalanced crank, new 100 Engle cam, and dual
Weber 34's, and is balanced within an inch of it's
life.  On the way north, caravanning with Barry, Kerry
in his highroof, and Angela (of Grooveedubs), I ran
very hot (up to 240+) on the way north, but off and
on, and very unintuitive temps vs. conditions.  Like
downhill, the temperature would rise, but when the
engine was working hard, the temperature would fall. 
And I was getting a bit over 21 mpg.  On the way back
today, my temperature never got above about 220, and I
averaged better than 25 mpg.  Approximately same
ambient temps, notwithstanding waking up to snow.

Anybody got any ideas about why?  Break in the engine
and it runs cooler?  Why the increase in mileage?

Aside from my broken accelerator cable and the snow,
it was a great trip, and a good show.  (Too many bugs,
but that's just me.)
