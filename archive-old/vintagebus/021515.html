Thanks for everybody's concern, but I arrived back in Albuquerque yesterday 
afternoon.  Much less fun driving a '55 Ch_at_vy panel truck pulling a trailer 
w/ a bus on it at 55 than driving a bus at 60 or better, but all vehicles are 
now where they should be.  The coolest thing was the agricultural inspector 
who asked when I stopped to get inspected, &quot;Which one's older?&quot;  Alas, the 
Chevy was.
