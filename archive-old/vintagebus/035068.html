Subject: WHERE to connect preheat tube intake?
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

I am prepping my Boston Bob 1600 DP long block with a 66-67 1500 SP oil bath 
air cleaner (the hung from engine compartment ceiling type).  So I am looking 
over where to connect the preheat tube for the air cleaner.  Looks like I 
have 3 options:

OPTION 1: 1 inch tube connected to 211 129 511 (A) - This is the metal tube 
which bolts to some part of the exhasut system to draw air off of or near 
head #2 or #4 (I have never seen it).  Clara mentioned in the archive that if 
you don't have the metal tube one can wedge the paper hose between the push 
rod tubes.  I could do that or make a tube if someone had a picture.  This 
setup routes the preheat up through the rear (fif) engine apron tin.

OPTION 2: 1 inch tube connected to heat exchanger - I was looking over the 
stock 1500 H block I pulled the air cleaner from (from a 1967 bus) and 
noticed that it had the setup where the preheat tube went through the front 
vertical engine tin and connected directly to the heat exchanger near 
cylinder #1.  I did not find any mention of this setup in the archive or 
63-67 Bently.  I did find a picture of it in my parts book under Main Group 2 
- exhaust system.  In the parts book, it looks like it is connected to a 
stale air heat exchanger, which makes me think it is a early setup.  I have 
also seen these connections on the new ceramic finned Dansk heat exchangers.  
Seems like this air would be a LOT warmer than ambient air from around the 
head (option #1), plus it is under pressure from the heating system / engine 
fan.

OPTION 3: 2&quot; tube to cylinder air - This would be similar to the 68-71 bus 
and 70-74 bettle.  There is a larger metal tube with a flared wider intake 
that takes air from behind the cylinders.  I guess the concept here was to 
have more air (bigger tube) but from a cooler spot (cylinders, not heads or 
heat exchanger).  I would have to modify my air cleaner with a 2&quot; opening for 
the enlarged 2&quot; tube.  I am wondering if the air cleaner intake snout has a 
air flow just right for the 1&quot; tube and if putting a 2 inch tube on there 
might some how mess up the high rpm / cold air flap or something.  Also, the 
stock air cleaner with 2&quot; preheaters (from what I can tell) seemed to be 
combined with some sort of themostatic control of the aforementioned flap.  I 
am wondering if this thermostatic control was introduced for emmission 
(cleaner air) or operational reasons (makes engine run better without having 
to hold flap open manually in hot/dry conditions). 

I guess I am tending toward option #2 (heat exchanger takeoff) since that is 
how this air cleaner was set up when used on an engine (1500 SP) that most 
closely matches mine (1600 DP).

Opinions, Suggestions?
