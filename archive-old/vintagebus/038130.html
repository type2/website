&lt;&lt; I have had a problem with my clutch, in my '64 micro.
 At first it would change gear proberly, and when I start the bus with the 
clutch push to the buttom, the bus is giving a little spring forward. This 
problem, we fix by ajust the clutch.&gt;&gt;
Hi Lars,
Sounds like you had a flywheel seal leak that gunked up the clutch disc.  
This when you first started up your bus would cause the clutch disc to be 
suctioned to the flywheel.

&lt;&lt; BUT  Now the problem is when I give the bus gas ex. by 60 Km/h in 4. gear, 
the
 only thing that's happens is that the engine get more rpm but no speed. My 
question is now can I adjust this or should I change the clutch ?  Is it a 
sign to adjust now and change in about 500 Km or so (not drive on a vacation 
without changing)?  &gt;&gt;
The problem now most likely is that you have over adjusted the clutch to 
tight to less than 1/2&quot; play in the clutch pedal.  On top of that you most 
likely have burnt the clutch disc, and especially the clutch pressure plate.  
So you need to limp it home after you readjust the clutch pedal.  Once home 
to remove the engine, replace the flywheel seal, and while you are in there 
reset the crankshaft end play.  Then replace both the clutch disc and 
pressure plate.  You might also want to mar up the face of the flywheel a 
bit.  We do this to avoid having a slightly leaking flywheel seal make the 
clutch disc suctioned to the flywheel.
  You really need to also figure out why the flywheel seal failed.  Has it 
just been a long time since it was last replaced or do you have a stuck oil 
pressure relief valve/s or perhaps you have too big of oil pump and are 
RPMing the engine to high when the engine is cold and the outside weather is 
cold or was your flywheel seal destroyed by to much end play or slight 
corrosion on the engine case where the flywheel seal seats?    Eric&amp;Barb
