Well the euphoria was short lived.  I priced airlines and everything seems
like the trip could be done but alas, it appears that this year I'm going to
have a schedule conflict with work and family obligations so I'll have to
bow out.  I hope you guys down there at BBTB do like you did last year and
post pictures of the event in progress.  I really enjoyed seeing that as it
happened.  I guess I'll have to settle for being there in spirit and mind.
See ya round...
