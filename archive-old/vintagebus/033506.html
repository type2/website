Subject: Custom running gear and engines lately...
Mime-Version: 1.0

I just want to say that I'm enjoying the questions lately about custom 
transaxles and engines going into old busses....late bus IRS, Porsche 
5-speed, ect.

It would be very much appreciated if you vintage guys out there would bite 
your tongue a bit on this one and not come back with &quot;why would you do that 
to a bus&quot; or &quot;leave it the way it was meant to be&quot;. If you've got a real 
world experiece of why it didn't work for you or some other bus you've 
experienced in person, definatly let us all know. But there are a lot of us 
on the list that are at the very least interested in reading about 
&quot;conversions&quot; and would appreciate not having the discussion squashed by 
generic negative comments. I personally don't have any custom plans in the 
works, but love to learn about other people have done their work. I'm kinda 
open minded and really like to soak up the info. So lets not get into the 
&quot;negative vibe&quot; thing on this...OK?

Just my opinion. Thought I'd get it out there early.
