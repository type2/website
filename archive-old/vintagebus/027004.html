Subject: Re: Genuine VW parts from dealers?

Last year I needed a small plastic part for the carb linkage on a '74
Westy... I was fortunate enough to get a part number for it from a
fellow listee. I called the part number in to the local VW dealer, who
had the part for me in a couple of days.

&quot;What is this, anyway?&quot; asked the guy at the parts counter... I told him
it was for the carb linkage for a '74 bus, and he was surprised that he
was able to get it for me...

The shop I work for has a lot of obsolete parts that are shelved in
numerical order, covered with dust, which are inventoried in the
computer, but are unfamiliar to our parts guy who hasn't sold one in the
last 3 years... 

If you know the part number for what you need, you have a much better
chance of finding it at the dealer...
