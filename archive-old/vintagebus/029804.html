Good topic Scott!

My first driving experience was driving a bus on the freeway going from LA to
Washougal (?) WA when I was 10.  Parents' friend and I in the bus and my mom and
friend's wife in the truck behind.  The look on my mom's face when she saw me
driving was priceless!

When I was 14, I stole my mom's 66 standard and went driving in the rain.  Couldn't
figure out where reverse was.  That was an interesting drive, not to mention the
story I tried to pass on my dad when he came home for lunch and the car was gone!  I
got grounded for 3 months!

That same 66 was to be my driver's test vehicle.  The tester wouldn't give me the
test because there wasn't any belts.  I went back the next day with the 528i Beemer,
but  I failed because I couldn't get used to the hydralic clutch!!  They eventually
let me take the test in the bus.  I got an 86.  I aced the test, but they docked me
for the belts.
