&gt;I can probably get my oil temp down with external coooler etc, but is that
really any better?
I would be simply treating the symptom, and not the cause.  An artificially
cool engine
may not be any healthier than a hot one.&lt;

Markus,

        I think that you are on the right track here.  When you have
exhausted all possibilities of fixing the problem, though, then all you are
left with is Bandaids.  I have exhausted all possibilities on my engine so
I am following along with an approach that is really only possible for
V-dubs and has been highly vocalized by the elustrious Bob Hoover.  That
is: to rebuild before you need it.

        I have two engines, that I rebuild the others parts while using
one.  Just this weekend, I installed a new carb that I had rebuilt off of
the alternate engine.  It sure was nice to just have a part ready to go
without having to do any work first.  I also have a freshly rebuilt T2
1600cc sitting on my garage floor  ready to go.....that is if my current
engine doesnt hold out long enough to end up in my Sgl Cab.
