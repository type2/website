&gt; Hi Mark,
&gt; We had the same happen to us and have had the brass tube pull out of the carb 
&gt; on occasion when changing the flexable fuel line (Use German cloth covered 
&gt; type of fuel line only!) every two years.  Take a hammer and center punch and 
&gt; punch four to six marks in the pot metal of the carb and fuel pump around 
&gt; these tubes to tighten up the holes on these tubes.

IMHO, this isn't sufficient.  Here's what I do:

If a nipple comes off instead of the rubber line, I clean the nipple and
its socket in the carb *squeaky* clean with carb cleaner and let it dry.
I roll the part of the nipple that goes into the carburator on a hard
surface with a file to put a bit of a knurl into the metal.  I then mix up
a small batch of JB-Weld (a fuel-proof epoxy).  A tiny amount of the epoxy
goes into the socket and the rest coats the knurled portion of the nipple.
Tap the nipple home, leaving the small bead of epoxy around the place
where the nipple emerges from the carburator.  Let this sit for a day or
two to cure completely.  I've never had a nipple installed in this way
pull out.
 
&gt; Either make sure your German grommet is still in place around the metal 
&gt; fuel line where it goes through the forward engine tin.  If the grommet is 
&gt; missing or cut through protect this metal line from sawing itself through on 
&gt; the sheet metal edge by sliding about a 2&quot; long piece of German fuel line 
&gt; that you have slit lengthwise and with the slit upwards hose clamp it into 
&gt; place!

Another way is to take a length of inner tube rubber 2 inches wide and to
wrap the fuel line.  Keep wrapping until the thickness is just a bit
larger than the hole in the tin and then push it it.  From that point on,
the rubber stays in the tin and I pull the fuel line out when the tin
comes apart.  The inner tube rubber lasts much longer than a grommet,
damps vibration, seals the hole, and gives ample warning of deterioration.
