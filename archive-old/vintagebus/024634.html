Subject: Blue floor mats... '66 Deluxe


    Well I just got back from my favorite salvage yard with interesting
news...

    The '66 (found the ID plate) Deluxe has no floor mats of any color,
BUT...!

    it does have the seat pedestal covers in this neat medium blue color
&lt;&lt;G&gt;&gt;

    Did not remove them today, as the truck I was using needed to go
home...

    I'll have to go back another day when I can take my time...

    These mats did look fairly decent with some fading, but the pebble
grain finish didn't look too worn. One problem I did note was the 1/8&quot;
bead at the edge toward the dogleg(passenger side) has partially split
off...  Can't get the driver's door open so don't know about that
side...

    These mats are for a bench seat 1/3-2/3  Non-walkthru '66 Deluxe 13W
Bus...

    I got the rear seat, cargo door panels, and passenger side (other
side is destroyed) of the inside nose panels today.

    Door panel will be useful as pattern pieces and for color match
only... You might be able to save one or two of the trim strips but they
are pretty bad (I wonder if anyone knows of the guy out west who
restores the aluminum trim?).

    might be useful to someone, I don't need the trim for my '63
Standard, so they'll be for FS relatively cheap....

    I wish this had been a Walk thru Deluxe 'cause these floor mats
would really have looked great in my '63...

        I'll be going back fairly soon, should anyone be interested in
me picking them up...

        Take care...

                JonR
