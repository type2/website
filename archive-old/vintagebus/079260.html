Subject: Re: [VB] 30 Pict Jets

  I just did a new Mexi 1600 and installed the 30/31 with the adapter. I never looked at the main but it has  what ever 
they come with when new. I had to change the main pilot to a 55 as I was getting some lean pop at higher rpm's. It 
also has a new 034 Bosch single vac dizzy.  Other wise it is a bone stock engine. No dyno test on it so I'll have to wait 
till the owner installs it to see how well it runs under load

&gt;Can someone tell me what jets are the correct ones for a 30/31 Pict 
&gt;(dual idle jet / new Brazilian) running on a stock 1600 with a '62 stock 
&gt;air cleaner?  Or, how about a link to a Solex book or manual.  I 
&gt;remember long ago someone posting a link to one, but of course I can't 
&gt;find it now.
&gt;
&gt;Thanks!
&gt;
