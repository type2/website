Subject: RE: [VB] King Pin rebuild help is needed...

As I've been following this thread, the I think coolest part is that 
Rob has created an effective tool that has his last name in it.

Can anyone else say they've done that?

If only I could finally perfect that  Johnson Rod Enhancer tool I've 
been working on and needing for years ;)

Happy Holidays!
