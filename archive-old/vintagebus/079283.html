Subject: Re: [VB] rear wheel cylinder failure

   If you used a VARGA master cylinder as the replacement you will need to grind/cut off some material off the rod. I 
have found this needed to be done on 62 to 66 buses. Why these years I do not know, but those are the years I have 
had to do this to. None of my 1960 buses have needed this as I had enough adjustment in the rod to get clearence.
   I have never replaced the master in a 61 so I cannot say (but have sold plenty to people with 61's and nobody 
mentioned a problem). I also found this to be needed when using the FAG/FTE and other names they go by so call 
Made in Germany master cylinders (current supply)

&gt;note on the master cylinder: one thing that's been bugging me after 
&gt;replacing the master cylinder is that even though i've adjusted the 
&gt;pedal adjuster screw, the master cylinder plunger seems a tad (1/8&quot;) 
&gt;too long.  i.e. with the brake pedal adjust bolt is backed out all the 
&gt;way, the master cylinder plunger seems like its slightly engaged (i.e. 
&gt;slightly pushed in).  I assume this isn't normal.  Is this just the 
&gt;fact that it's a crappy aftermarket part.  Could this be my problem?
