Subject: Mudflaps on Ebay

I just thought I would warn you about buying Mudflaps on ebay. There is a seller who is claiming to have NOS German Mudflaps for sale but they are Not German. I won one of his auctions but fortunately he never completed the transaction. I have been in contact with the other buyer and he told me they are brazillian and are complete garbage. The seller appears to be a &quot;major&quot; supplier of VW parts as well, though they had some setbacks within the last few years. Here is the link:
