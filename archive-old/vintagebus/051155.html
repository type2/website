Subject: Re: [VB] Worlds longest rebuild?

&gt; What is the longest its taken anyone to finish a
motor???

Jon (hazetguy) Furst can attest to the fact that it
took me over two years from start to finish on one
engine rebuild.  Between other projects, young
girlfriend, change of shops and lethargy, things can
really drag out.  I've got three engines now, along
with (at least) two other projects, sitting waiting
for  my attention, plus I'm trying to get my land
ready to build my retirement home.  Wait, I'm already
retired!
