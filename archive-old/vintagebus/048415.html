Subject: Re:Logo advice

Why not have it silk-screened onto the canvas? That is the biggest open
area. You could do it a little larger and ad some kind of cool vintage
looking radio with some kind of atomic rings around it or something. You
might even be able to spray it on using some kind of fabric paint. I
actually think I agree with Thom on this one (that scares me). It looks as
though it should go somewhere other than the gates. The canvas wins my vote
or maybe the front doors.
