&lt;&lt; Does anyone know if a Saphire I is correct for a 59/60 bus?  If not what
is? &gt;&gt;

Hi Phil,

Well in essense there are no correct radios for the VW since they were dealer
accessories.  Have seen documentation for installing a 1960-63 Blaupunkt in a
1957 bug.  Also have seen photos of a plate to install a 1953 on up radio into
a split window, or barn door dash.  On the other hand have just recently seen
a 1957 Motorola Radio installed properly in a low milage 1959 bug.

  So if you mean is the Saffire I radio (With Ivory push buttons not the
silver gray ones.) something that could have been installed in your VW at the
dealership when it was purchased new, then the ansewer is yes.  Also the AM/FM
Saffire II, and many other Blaupunkt, Akkord, Becker, etc. radios.  Eric &amp;
