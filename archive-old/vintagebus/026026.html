&gt; Amazing.....if rumor has it...this bus just sold for 12K this week.

The Bus belongs to a friend of mine. Very much worth the $$, complete running
gear is like new including narrowed front beam, which I can testify first
hand takes much time and patience to do. I got pointers from Jason (the Buses
owner) when I did the one on my '56 Panel and it's no easy task. Engine and
trans are both new low mileage units, and although it's not the prettiest
thing to look at it runs and drives like a new car. Very nice!! Although not
quite 12K it did sell for over 10K and was actually sold at Pomona and was
delivered to the new owner (it's going overseas, go figure) at the OCTO show
this last weekend. I was contacted after the sell because the same buyer is
looking for more just like it. I guess building &quot;beaters&quot; with new running
gear instead of trailer queen show winners all these years wasn't such a
waste of time after all................................
