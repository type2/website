&gt;I would like to find a source for a European 4 ring binder so I can put my
&gt;loose tech bulletins and other vintage info in to protect it.  I have not
&gt;been able to find any locally.  It seems that the paper size is 11 3/4 inches
&gt;by 8 1/4 inches.
&gt;I have several shop manuals and a special tools for local manufacturer book
&gt;from the 50's that use the same paper size.  My question is this euro only?
&gt;Or did VW use it exclusively during the 50's.
&gt;
&gt;Any help would be appreciated.

I believe what you're looking for is called A4 paper size. If nothing 
turns up let me know and I'll send one to you. These sizes have 
either 2 or 4 holes.
