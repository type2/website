Subject: Re: [VB] camp out facilities

Paul,
	You need to be a bit more specific about which VW Bus camp outs you 
are considering for me to give any really 48% accurate info.  All that I 
have participated in have had enough facilities for the average VW bus 
camping families.  All camps that the Arizona Bus Club put on have 
excellent facilities but you need to bring your own shower.  May people 
do.  The VW Bus Camp at the Burning Man Festival has the best communal 
meals of any VW bus camp I've been part of.  Pretty much some of the 
best meals I've ever eaten!
	 So, make sure to join a VW bus camp out soon.  Bring something 
nice to share with your neighbors.  You may meet lots of different sorts 
of people, but they all will be your friends!  Gary Gibson
