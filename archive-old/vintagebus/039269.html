Subject: Sand in Engine Compartment
Date: Mon, 6 Jul 1998 06:28:30 -0700 

I finally got the opportunity to delve into the workings
of my recently acquired '67 Deluxe HT.  There'll be plenty
of posts on various things (after having checked the 
archives of course).

Today's topic is sand in the engine compartment.  The
PO had the bus sand blasted and didn't clean up well.

My first task was to remove battery to clean and charge.
Also to better start cleaning the leftover sand from the
engine bay.   I found a couple of inches in the little space
between the right fender and vertical piece ahead of the 
battery.  Still a bunch of sand held in place by the little
amount of oil on the engine.

I got as much out as reasonable using a vacuum, but 
each time I touch anything, more sand falls.

I need to pull the distributor, but am leery of disturbing
the sand and getting some into the engine internals.

The question is thus formulated:
What's the best way to get the sand out?

Some thoughts are as follows:
Get engine idling (it'll do that, but not accelerate) and
using Simple Green like stuff, spray engine area and 
hose it all down, hoping to wash the sand out?

Pull the engine and manually clean or hose clean engine?
Then hose down the engine bay?

Too late to have done it right, such as clean it up before
installing engine.  I bought it, I have to deal with it.
