Subject: 1967 Front Bearing Nut

I've heard from various sources that the late model hex nut for keeping a 
front bearing in place, should work for my '67.

I tried this over the weekend and found that the nut from my '71 didn't 
want to screw onto my front spindle with only fingers used for the 
tightening.  I don't want to force it and strip my spindle, but I'm in a 
bit of a bind and kinda need something RIGHT NOW.  

(A very kind Mark Dearing has sent one to me but it hasn't quite arrived 
yet, probably due to mail screening at my building).

Does anyone have thoughts on whether this should work or not?

Should I force it?  (OBviously: no)

The threads measure the same between the nuts, so one would think it would 
work...

Thanks,
	Tom
