IMHO, I would track down
&gt; &gt; a good used late

&gt; &gt; valuable shop time
&gt; &gt; putting together an engine that will haul your bus
&gt; &gt; around comfortably
&gt; &gt; and last for awhile.

&gt;I tend to agree..
&gt;Ask around, find a decent 1600cc case that hasn't been
&gt;thrashed too much and build you engine from there.
&gt;The parts will be cheaper and the engine will last
&gt;longer.
&gt;Some folks say SP heads, others say DP.

From archive searches a dual relief 1776 sp with dual 1bbls seems to be 
'the' bus motor for the less traditional but still conservative.  Would 
probably require less effort and not much more money than what you were 
intending to do with the 40hp case.  Particularly if you can flycut the case 
and heads.
