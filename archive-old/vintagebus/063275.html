&gt;Well, it did turn over but I could only get one turn of the engine at 
&gt;a time. I electrify the ignition wire and I get one &quot;Whooomp&quot; as the
&gt;engine turn over, then another &quot;Whooomp&quot; as it turns over again, but
&gt;it won't turn fast enough to get the engine to start.

You have a bad connection on a fat wire somewhere, probably on the
ground side.  My '64 (6 volt) did this until I replaced the tranny
ground strap.  Before I did that I had a battery cable (switch-to-starter
type with flat lugs on each end instead of battery terminal clamps)
from one of the generator stand bolts to where the battery negative
strap bolts to the body, which also helped.

As a temporary version of this, you can use half of a set of jumper
cables - clip one black clip to the battery negative terminal or
ground strap bolt and clip the other black clip to the engine case
somewhere (please, not on the fuel lines or carb, and be careful of
the belt).  Also, were all the connections bright and shiny when you
made them up?  If not, undo the battery ground strap, then go around
with your wire brush.  Make sure the positive cable is in reasonably
good shape - no flaky corrosion and securely attached to the terminals
at both ends. 

Make sure the Bus is out of gear.  If you want to lessen the load
on the engine a little, put a cinder block on the clutch pedal, or
wedge a stick between it and the parcel tray, etc.

Good luck!
