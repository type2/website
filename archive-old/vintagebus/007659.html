Yeah, I know. Just getting sick of asking questions i could answer myself if
I didn't get so frustrated. Original question was about backfiring, well I
figured that out, 1 and 2 spark plug wires were crossed, like I thought.
Still the high high high revving at start, only it just seems to idle
really, really high. I can rev it up with gas pedal, but white smoke comes
out and I don't like it, so i stop :). Things I have it narrowed down to is
something stuck/sticking in linkage, but that has been taken apart and put
back together, so probably not that. Could be mechanical problem, I deleted
a message that someone said one of the butterflys could be stuck open, or
something. Or a vaccuum leak..which is seeming less and less likely. I have
checked everyplace I assume one could be. Is there anything I'm missing? Oh,
the choke, but I have that adjusted. Its an electromagnetic (i think). Has a
little coil inside a housing, end of coil has circle that you put into a
little knob on housing, and spinning it opens and closes the choke, then you
tighten it at the correct tightness.
Would the choke really cause this? Seems strange to me.
