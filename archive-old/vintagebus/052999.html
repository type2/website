Subject: Re: [VB] problems installing rear window on double cab  help  help

I recall having to exert a supreme amount of effort on the rear window in my 62 double cab. I had the entire seal/frame heavily lubed with go-jo, friend inside to unwind the string, and was practically ramming it with my shoulder to get it in. It took almost an hour, but it finally went in. I was rather frightened that I would smash it, but it held up splendidly. Good luck...  

 
&gt; I have tried three times to install the rear window and It won't go in it 
&gt; seems that the seal is to fat . I ordered a seal from ronnie for a truck and 
&gt; it is the same as the bus one .  SO WHY CANT'T I GET THE WINDOW TO SEAT WHERE 
&gt; IT SHOULD ?
&gt; I have installed several windows with no problems but the rear window of this 
&gt; truck seems to be a big struggle.  any one have any hints or suggestions.  I 
&gt; am using soap water and a string around the seal. But it is just to big to 
&gt; get inside the lip.
&gt; help please    John  65 double cab
