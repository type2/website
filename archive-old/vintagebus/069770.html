Subject: RE: [VB] FW: Eureka! I think I found the idleing issue

All the previous peices of my OLD engine must just have too much bad Karma.
Getting a new cleaned SP manifold and installing. The OLD engine required
the exhuast holes on the stock muffler to be widened to fit the heavy
flycuts. It is likely, since the builder (this is NOT the engine I just
got), didn't use intkae gaskets, and torqued it down, he bent it about 1/16?
in, and therefore it leaks.
Every possible problem....I seem to get.
AL


Hi Al,
We doubt that the intake manifold could be that badly bent just due to a
badly flycut engine.  Do check for vaccum leaks, but make sure the check the
whole length of the  manifold and if no leak found remove it and run a water
test to make sure the heat riser tubes are not rusted through to the intake
tube.
