&gt; In my 6 years now being into VW's I have never dealt with a
&gt; person of this type before. His customer service cannot be matched


I would second that.  We also use Rancho for our rebuilt transaxles, and on
the very rare occasion that a problem has occurred (warranty issue, shipping
damage, etc.), Sam has been quick to resolve the problem.  Rancho is also
very fair when it comes to core refunds. Many engine or trans rebuilders use
their &quot;core deposits&quot; as a profit center, knocking off part of your core
refund for any little thing that is wrong with your core, to the point that
to get back your whole core deposit you would practically have to send them
a core that didn't need rebuilding in the first place!  And others deny
virtually any warranty claim, blaming &quot;user abuse&quot; or &quot;improper
installation&quot; almost every time.  (A less-than-scrupulous rebuilder has
every incentive to blame a failure on the user since then he does not have
to swallow the cost of the repair.)  Incidentally, I have found one engine
rebuilder, AVP, to be of the same caliber, although this has little
relavence to Vintage Bus listmembers since their specialty is Type 4 and
Wasserboxer engines. Rebuilders like Rancho and AVP are very hard to find in
an industry where many larger outfits run assembly-line operations with
unskilled labor and questionable practices.  When you find a good one, you
stick with them.
