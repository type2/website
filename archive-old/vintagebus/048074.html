&lt;&lt; when the motor is refired after less than 5 minutes of sitting it fires 
immediately. if
 the motor sits longer than that after driving in the heat it really takes 
some cranking &amp; gas pedal pumping to get it to refire. on ocassion after 
driving during the day when i shut down it will diesel for a moment. any 
thoughts?   &gt;&gt;
Hi Terry,
Sounds suspiciously like it is either running too rich, or more likely one of 
at least three things is keeping the fuel flowing down the manifold after the 
engine is shut off.  Causing a flooded engine five minutes later.  Eric&amp;Barb
