Want to thanks all on this list who have helped out with parts for my 59. My
wife got me some VW shirts, and a 65 Cadillac Coupe one owner 56,000 miles
on it! Everything on it works! I now own a 78 bus, 59, bus, 73 sport beetle,
and the Cad! I'm still looking for an engine lid, with stay, for my 59. Oh,
I also got a VW Jacket too. It has been very cold here, like 9 below, but
both my 78 and 73 have run like tops. My 59 is still being restored.

HAPPY HOLIDYS!!

Jay Marvin
