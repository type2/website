Subject: Re: [VB] Type 1 in a 74 bus

Let me add that the two bolts on the transaxle are small bolts on the top of 
the transaxle.  They are not like the bolts on split buses.

&gt;
&gt;Make sure the engine is supported by more then just bolted to the 
&gt;transaxle.
&gt;  There are only two bolts at the transaxle supporting it so if you add the
&gt;weight of the engine without any other support you are asking for problems
&gt;down the road.  Also see if any additional sheet metal was put around the
&gt;engine.  There is alot of open area when you stick a type I engine in a 
&gt;type
&gt;IV bus.  Without the extra sheet metal the bus has probably been running
&gt;hot.  In the winter that isn't so bad but the heat damage to the engine
&gt;could have already taken place.

&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;So I'm considering buying a 74 bus that has a type 1 motor in it.  I sort
&gt;&gt;of like the idea in that it'll be more similar to my 60 and it won't have
&gt;&gt;any FI stuff - that I don't know anything about.  Anyone have any tips on
&gt;&gt;what I should look for in a bus that's been converted like this.  My plan
&gt;&gt;is to use this bus as a winter daily driver.  I figure if I keep the
&gt;&gt;underside nice and clean it and spray it with chain oil a couple times 
&gt;&gt;over
&gt;&gt;the winter, it should be fine.  I just don't want to drive my 60 in the
&gt;&gt;Canadian winter besides the elements there are people who are poor drivers
&gt;&gt;in the elements.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;TIA
