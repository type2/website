Hi, I have a 62 flip seat westy. I want to get my tent up but have never
done it. 
Can anyone tell me about the rear bumper mounting of the tent pole. My front
bumper has a bracket mounte and is obvious. It says in a drawing I found
that you stick the pole in the rear bumper area somewhere but the only hole
I see is the drain hole in the corner body panel and it looks too small for
the pole anyway. Where does the tent pole fit back there?

Bob
