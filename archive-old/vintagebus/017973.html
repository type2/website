Subject: Free Vanagon Auction Site

Hello, I just wanted to let everyone know about an
auction web site
I've been working on. It's only for VW vans and parts
and accessories.

http://www.snycomp_dot_com/vanagon

There is no charge to the seller or buyer. I had some
server space that I wasn't doing anything with, so I
thought I'd put this up.

Of course, eBay will get you a much wider audience,
but it will also cost you $25.00 even if your vehicle
doesn't sell, or $50.00 if it does. You can try my
site for nothing. The auction runs similar to eBay's,
including proxy bidding, reserves, pictures, etc.

Oh, if you want to give me a link from your web site
to the auction site, that would be cool. Just let me
know and I'll give a link to your site from the
auction.

If anyone has suggestions, please email me.
Thanks!
Later. . . . . . . .Brad
