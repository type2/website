&lt;&lt; Any idea why? Could it be that the proximity of the heater boxes and the 
hard connection to the rear heads just causes heat transfer so that the 
heater boxes need to be cooled by either heat use or bypass air to keep the 
mass from heating up? &gt;&gt;
Hi Andy,
Our best guess is.... 
The #1 &amp; #3 cylinders end up with more back pressure since the exhaust gases 
coming out of them does not shrink from cooling when the heater boxes turn 
into parka like insulation chambers when the pressurized cooling air from the 
shroud is cut off.  This results in the surrounding metal getting hotter and 
hotter and the exhaust gases do not move along as easily or as fast when they 
are still expanding inside the heater J-tubes.
  How ever it happens we do know for a fact that with the fresh air tubes 
sealed off the oil temperature will automaticly rise 20-30F!  Also that 
cheapy Dansk heat exchangers with no internal ribbing (Also almost all small 
forward snouted fresh air heat exchangers made during the latter half of 1963 
and very early 1964 also have no internal cooling fins!) cause the same oil 
temp problems if used on engines bigger than 1200cc.   Eric&amp;Barb
