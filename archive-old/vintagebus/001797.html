I've got some words of wisdom for you. RELAX!!!!!  this is supposed to be
fun; if you break down, so what. The roadsides are not heaped with abandoned
vehicles and the bodies of people whos rides crapped out. If something
happens; which it probably won't ,somebody will help you out. More than one
bus motor has been rebuilt on a picnic table at BNNTA, and all of us at one
time or another has played the &quot;roadside diagnosis&quot; game. You'll find that
we're a friendly and helpful not to mention resourceful bunch of people.
Picture yourself pulling back into your driveway with a successful and fun
trip under your belt.
Leave your Ch*vy at home.

&gt; Hello All,
&gt;
&gt;       Well here's where I'm at. I have 19 days left until my maiden
&gt; voyage of 507 miles round trip to BNNTA. This is my first trip of any
&gt; length in my bus, and I'm a little nervous. So far here is a list of
&gt; things done in the last couple months to get ready.
&gt;
&gt; 1. New exhaust
&gt; 2. New tires and shocks
&gt; 3. New master cyl, brake lines and rear pads
&gt; 4. New axle boots
&gt; 5.Tranny flush
&gt; 6.New plugs and wires
&gt; 7.New battery
&gt; 8.New (used) gas tank
&gt; 9.Adj. valves
&gt; 10. Greased undercarriage
&gt; 11. Changed oil
&gt; 12.New fuel filter
&gt; 13.New air filter
&gt; 14. Lights working except hazard and domes.
&gt;
&gt; O.K. thats the list. I've got a 73 or 74 bug motor and have no clue how
&gt; many miles are on it. The speedo isn't working, so no odometer. It
&gt; starts with no problem. It doesn't make any funny sounds or leak or
&gt; shake like the bejesus. It seems to have good get up and go and the
&gt; tranny doesn't sound like an accident waitin to happen. Now here is MY
&gt; problem. This bus had been sitting for a few years and I'm scared as
&gt; hell about the upcoming trip. Nothing at all seems to be wrong. That's
&gt; what freaks me out. I've got a long trip and it would break my heart and
&gt; credit card if I broke down. Does anyone have any advice as to what I
&gt; may be missing or over looked?  I just don't want to miss the event, or
&gt; drive my chevy! I've been told by friends to stop,  that I'm worrying
&gt; for no reason that everything seems fine. But they have never owned a VW
&gt; before. Any and all words of wisdom would be great! Thanks.
&gt;
