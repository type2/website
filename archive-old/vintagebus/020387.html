Hey folks,This weekend I went down to San Diego to pick up something from Dave Gillingham (thanks Dave) and experienced some overheating on my 6K mile 1600 DP motor.  This motor had been running like a top for the last year and made the 900 mile trip up to KP/RB with no problems!  This motor never ran more that 200 degrees even at 70mph in warm weather. I just adjusted the valves and had recently futzed with the carb and timing to try and cure my incureabel flat spotSpecs:  1600 DP with dog house, flaps, 31pict,'71 dual vac. dual adv. dizzy, stock exhaust, all tin, rubber and lid in tact, no air obstructions, correct belt tension, 20/50 Valvoline, no full flow, big nut tranny, 15&quot; wheels running 205 15's, driving 60-62 mph.  All internals stock.I left Friday night at 9 pm (70 degrees) and after about 10 miles I'm already hitting 210 on the oil temp.  After about 30 miles, I pulled over to get gas and disconnected (took off) the thermostat and bracket.  I figured either the flaps had stuck closed or they were hanging up.  I made sure that the flaps were in the fully opened position.  Back on the road for another 5 miles and it still will not come back to normal.  I pulled off one more time and retarded the timing, which seemed too far advanced (eyeball the vacuum canister test).  Still no good.  Limped to my parents house at 55 and kept it at 210 or a bit less.  Today, I drove down to Daves house on the coast and it was cool (in the 60's).  Still running above 210.  On the way back in the heat of the day I hit at least 220.  At that point I had to pull over and let it cool.  Did the spit test and it sizzled a bit and felt hotter than normal.  I could hold the stick, but just barely.  It runs great.  No pinging, idles smooth etc.  It just is running suddenly much hotter than it usually does.Question:  What could cause such a sudden heat increase??  After rebuilding this thing I did have to replace the relief valves and springs....it fixed the same type overheating problem (thanks Kyle).  Could t
n?  One of the valves stuck in its bore??  Foreign matter blocking the oil cooler port??  Plugged cooler??This motor does not have full flow, but there have never been chunks of anything in the oil...ever.  Its always been free from debris.Any ideas would be greatly appreciated.  I'm going to wait till dark to drive back the 100 or so miles home.  I'm stumped...what am I missing??Thanks.Steve
