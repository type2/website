Subject: RE: [VB] Progressive jets

Depends on what you have in there right now. If you have a rejetted carb
then you may have to bump up the air and main, if it is factory jets,
your main is plenty large enough but you need to bump up the air.
Worland WY is at 4900 ft and I know that I need plenty of air when I'm
there. For the trike I have a carb I take with me that is designated my
high plains carb.

Volks,

Anybody have an idea what a jet a progressive should be using at 4500
ft. elevation, with a bigger engine?  1835, that is, and .044 heads.  I
am only getting about 18 mpg.  Less with this !_at_#$! oxygenated fuel.

I know Eric says a different dizzy will help, and that is in the plan .

Curt
