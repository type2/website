George mused:   wonder if I could find one of those
nice sediment bowls with a drain like my dad had on
his 'ol tractor?

George, 
The local tractor and auto supply places still have
these, the last I checked (saw one just a few weeks
ago).  New screens and gaskets available at the local
Farm and Fleet store, I just put a new screen in my
1940 era Ford 9N tractor.
