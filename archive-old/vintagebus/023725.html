Subject: re: Bus tires

I need to replace the tires on an early Panel Van, with 15&quot; bus rims.
     I could go with the original bias ply 6.40 x 15 at a high price
tag,
     but would prefer radials, if possible.  But they need to be tall
tires
     to look right, and all I can find are low profile tires.  Anyone
     bought radials that work well on early 15&quot; bus rims?


I have used 205-75-15 tires in the past.  Only problem is they feel a
little spongy.  Buses originally had reinforced side wall tires.  You
might look at light duty truck tires.  Maybe at Sears.  They offer them
in differnent sizes to where you could fit them on a bus and get the
look you are looking for.
