But following JP you would be doing at least 68 mph all the way here. Now if
Berry is along plan on 55 mph the whole way.

&gt; i'd planned to tell you about my &quot;scientific experiment&quot; and then tell you
to slow down!  so after all this, my suggestion is to follow jp to havasu
with a lighter load and see if his slower speeds and the lighter load have
any effect on your gas mileage.  i think they will.

OK, if JP will let me I'll follow him to Havasu, and when I get there I
believe I'll have a Vodka and Tonic with JP and ruminate on MPG.  Looks
like I'm going to make it to BBB.  I'll be winning a Rancho pro-street
3.88 bus tranny right Ronnie?:)  About lightening the load, I sure hate to
leave behind my spare engine.  I just know I'll throw a rod if I don't
travel with the spare.  No roof rack though.  JP has ALL that stuff on the
top of his bus, seems like I should at least throw in a spare engine and
bottle of vodka.

See you all there.
