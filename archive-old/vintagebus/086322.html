Subject: Re: [VB] Brakes locking up on the way to work stinks!

 I once had the brakes get really hot after I adjusted them.    I only drove a few miles before I realised something was wrong.
 
I think after you stomp on them a few times they will &quot;center&quot; the shoes... so best to do that while the bus is still in the air and re-check for drag before driving.
