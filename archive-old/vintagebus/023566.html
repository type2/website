one day at Pomona swap meet. the  Milk Crate Police showed up.....

I do not think they knew what they were getting into !!!

they went row by row and took all the milk crates, telling people it was now 
(dump your parts on the ground) or they would be arrested for theft.......

well they got so many milk crates that they had to drag out of the swap meet, 
they were not set-up well as they did not had a wagon or cart

they ended up  pulling them out with a rope .......

They only showed up that one time....
We never saw them again, I think it was just too much work for guys that were 
not used to back braking work.........
