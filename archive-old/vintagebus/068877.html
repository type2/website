Subject: Possible early 60 Double Cab and Thing for sale...

It looks like I may be selling my 73 Thing and my 60 Double Cab. I will
know better sometime next week. The Double Cab is a very early 1960 and
is almost completely mechanically restored with a fully balanced (down
to the clutch disk) 1776 with dual weber 40's. It is full flowed with
external filter. The best shifting freeway flyer tranny was built by
Gary Zink of Maple Valley WA. I have had more than 10 different busses
and at least 3 new trannys and none have shifted this nice. There is
less than 15k on the motor and less than 10k on the tranny. There are
brand new Pirelli Scorpians, on a complete date matched set of crow's
foot rims and painted hub caps. The interior is nice in a tan vinyl
basket weave pattern and solid tan door panels. There are also two
Autometer guages (oil temp &amp; pressure) mounted in the overhead. The dash
is complete and uncut including a nice radio block off and original knee
bumper on the steering column holder. There is a roof rack and original
tilt frame in the back. The bed is in excellent shape and I not seen
many gates in as good of shape on any trucks. There is some rust in the
rocker under the back door and a few small rust spots around the lower
areas. The nose is beautiful as are the back corners. The brakes are all
new. Once again this truck was built to drive and cruises very nicely
and the heat works great. I am probably going to ask $9000 for this and
again I will know next week for sure.

The Thing is better than new in many ways and differs from most standard
restorations in that ALL of the mechanical parts are new. Not just big
items like the engine and tranny, but wheel bearings, CV joints, ball
joints etc... It has a pro built 1776 with dual Weber 40's, full cooling
system with external filter, oil cooler, fan and thermostat, great
tranny with a Berg shifter. The top was an NOS German top, Thing shop
glass side curtains, Thing shop exhaust, dealer option Jackman 5 spoke
wheels (powder coated with center caps), Teak duck boards with brass
pins, many hand machined details. They even used special flateners in
the paint to get that original Thing semi gloss look. The underside is
completely detailed and is often cleaner than the top side. This is one
of the nicest looking Things you will see. The complete package has only
8,500 miles on it (the speedometer was new at the time of restoration.)
I am hoping to get around $15,000. I will probably know next week if I
am selling for sure.

Once I make up my mind for sure I will post with very detailed listings.
Both of these vehicles have been a part of the family and have been
cared for as such. It would be much easier if they went to real
enthusiast's. Let me know if you are interested or know of anyone who
might be. I may take a Double Door Panel shell as a very small part of a
trade but mostly I need the cash. I will have another Thing but I doubt
I will ever have one this nice again and I will definitely have another
splitty soon.  I trust the reliability of these vehicles enough that I
would drive either of these cars to Florida tomorow!

Thanks for reading,
Craig

side of the Columbia river.
