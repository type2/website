Robert writ:

&gt;While cruising at a beautiful 55 mph last night on my way to the driving
range to hit a bucket of balls, I noticed sand coming out of the heater
vents under the windshields.  Not a lot, but enough to put a fine coating of
sand all over the dash.  Damn it!  I checked the cargo area and sure enough
there was a little on the rear floor that had come out of the rear heater
vent.
&gt;
&gt;Any suggestions on the best way to blow this stuff out, for good.  If I
stick an air hose in the rear at the heater tube connection, I'm going to
dust the bus.  Trying to blow from the heater vents backwards won't be as
effective, will it?  Or maybe it will, I'll have gravity on my side. I
suppose I could fit a small tube on the air hose and feed it down into the
heating vents.
&gt;


I have the same problem with Rosie. That damn sand gets in everything!
Perhaps using a shop vac inserted into the engine end of the heater tubes,
maybe with an assist from a compressed air nozzle (perhaps a small tube
inserted in the defroster vents and any other available orifi) to help stir
things up.
