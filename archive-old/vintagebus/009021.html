I happen to have a bunch of big white envelopes laying around and I happen
to have some of the expensive and hard to find glavanized steel banding that
you can use to repair your adjusting star tongs/clips.  This is the good
stuff that won't rust right away like your normal steel banding you find in
the lumber yard.

Send me a buck and I'll send you a 12&quot; stick of it - more than enough to do
a whole bus/bug/ whatever with enough left over to screw up on a couple
times.

If you decide you want it, email me first so I can kind of judge the demand
so I don't have money rolling in for stuff I don't have.
