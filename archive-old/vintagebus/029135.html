Like the story I related regarding the racecar, all the owner would have to do
is display the provenance.  Pictures, delivery papers, etc.  Then the zebra
stripes would add rather that detract from the points.  Scott, in your case,
I'll bet there's an m-code for delivery in primer (or a lack of paint code.) 
That would show its originality.

&gt; &gt;How will you judge buses that came from the factory not painted, and the
&gt; &gt;customer painted it after receiving it? I know that some buses from old

&gt; &gt;Africa.

&gt; Good question! Thankfully I'm not even in the running for being a judge, so
&gt; I don't have to make those decisions. :) My 55.5 Westy is a prime example
&gt; of a primered bus. The engine compartment is still OG primer, but the
&gt; original owner painted it. So, when it goes through the resto process I'm
&gt; planning on painting it in those original owner colors, not primer. But, I
&gt; might leave the engine compartment as is...
