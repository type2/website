Subject: RE: [VB] pressed bumper styles

&gt; The earlier/Barndoor style (pre-March 8, 1956) has a smaller license plate
&gt; portion which equates to a longer ribbed piece
&gt; 
everett, you be the man!  only you could pull an exact date out like that!
i agree that bill oughta keep his moose guard bumper.  he already said that
he'd trade me bumpers but i think he was referring to a non-guard,
non-barndoor bumper he's got.  my thoughts are that my truck will wear
either that moose guard bumper or the nasty barndoor bumper.

&gt; So, his bumper is wrong but yours may or may not be, depending on
&gt; production
&gt; date.
&gt; 
my single cab was produced, according to the vin and the number breakdown in
meredith's book, late may or early june.  i've tried to trace the bumpers to
the truck as far back as i could.  the bumpers, both front and rear, have
the same paint scheme(s) and wear so have been a pair since factory.
judging from shared damage the bumper and the truck have, they were
certainly together in the late 70s/early 80s.  coincidentally the paint
scheme on the bumpers match a paint scheme of my truck that prolly dates
back to the mid or late 60s.  i'd guess that the bumpers and truck left the
factory together.  i'd also guess that it makes my truck an odd transitional
2; wolfsburg barndoor bumpers, hannover transmission carrier, wolfsburg
dog-legs... who knows what other weirdness.  i'm just damn glad i can drive
it!
