&gt; I assume it is connected to the center of the horn button &amp;down the inside

Hi Jason,
You can see a good image of the bottom of the steering box and the horn 
grounding wire in the bottom picture in section V-9, page 2.  There should be 
a square plate on the bottom of the steering box held onto the box by four 
bolts.  In the center of this plate is a small hole you should have a brown 
grounding wire hanging out of and clamped to the plate by a thin bracket 
clamped to the plate by two of the rearward mounting bolts.  Only feed a new 
ground wire from the bottom upward!
