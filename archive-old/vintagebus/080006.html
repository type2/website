Subject: Re: [VB] Elastic cord and crimper ring source?

Sorry to chime in late on this, but I've been busy w/
Busses and Balloons and Bill Colville.

For the &quot;crimper rings&quot;, go to a hobby store and get
the correct diameter of brass tubing you need.  Then,
after ovalizing it and making your bungee material
loop, use a small chisel to close the ring down onto
the cord from both sides.  Then, in order to make it
look perfect (and so the material won't slip) make two
dents on each cord on the back of the ring (the side
against the wall) with a very sharp punch.  This makes
it look exactly like the original.  Don't worry if you
puncture the brass; that's how the originals were.
