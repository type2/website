Hi,

I spent all day yesterday fixing the lights on the bus so I could get it
safety inspected today. I started with a single left hand tail light and
when I was finished I had a complete set of running, brake and turn
lights :-)  So today I'm off to the inspector and as I put the clutch in
and am rolling to a stop in front of the shop I hear a big clunk and I
feel a real loose clutch pedal. I try to put it back in gear and check
out what happened but alas, it won't go in gear. I get underneath
thinking, &quot;Good thing the cable broke now insted of on our trip in 10
days&quot; However, once under the bus I'm able to see that the cable is
still quite solid and attached. Leaving the only thing left, jacked-up
cluth stuff. What exactly I'm not sure yet. Did the throwout bearing get
dislodged, did the springs in the spring plate break or something? Who
knows.  Not that it really matters, I'm still looking at having to pull
the engine after I tow it home. I'm getting to the point slowly.
After fighting to maintain a positive attitude I figured I might as well
fix or maintain whatever else I can while the engines out.  That is
whatever is significantly easier to fix once the engines out anyway. And
that's pretty much my question. I haven't had the engine out of this one
yet so is there anything I should be doing or looking for while I'm down
there? Wiring, fuel lines, anything like that. Anyway, thanks once more
in advance for your help. Does anyone else have jack points on there bus
that don't even get dirty before your putting a jack to them again? Just
curious, maybe it's just me.

'60 Bug  - passed the inspection
'67 Deluxe - deluxe meaning it came with the full assortment of
breakable and replaceable parts as opposed to the streamlined versions
that had only a handful of breakable parts.
