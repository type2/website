OK I finally ran my Double Cab on Thoms site and am still confused by the first M-Code on my 60 Double Cab. I looked the numbers up a while back in one of the bus books and came up with the similar info. The first number is 361. This is a combination of M169 - Sliding door types 231-238, M181 - Chrome hub caps, M192 - body ready to be outfitted as a camper, M199 - Drivers seat as swivel seat types 211
213 214 and camping car. This makes no sense to me. Can anyone shed some light on this?
The complete tag is as follows:
15 12 9
361 017 176 207
UA 265 Grey    the Vin is 547 523
thanks,
