Ronnie at oldvolks_dot_com saved the day for me today.  I've been having a heck
of a time trying to locate some idle stops for my 40IDF carbs.  I called up
Ronnie and he told me to give Performance Parts Warehouse a call in
Hauppauge, NY (www.webercarburetors_dot_com)  I called the guy up and he needed
my model number.  I got the number (7L) and since they have a $25 minimum
order, I got the idle adjustment screws and springs as well.  I gave him my
info and within 10 minutes from the point of my initial call, it was over
with.  Awesome!

I don't think I've ever heard them mentioned on here before but Ronnie was
right when he told me that they're the cheapest place.  They wanted $5 less
than Fast Freddie's for a similar batch of parts.

Here's their full info:

The Performance Parts Warehouse
150 Wireless Blvd.
Hauppauge, NY 11788

800-654-2778

Enjoy.
