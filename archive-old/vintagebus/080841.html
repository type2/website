Subject: Re: Upper shock bolt replacement, '59 panel

&gt;[shock absorber bolts]
&gt;
&gt;The problem comes when trying to select a bolt with the correct
&gt;diameter to fit through the hole.  I was able to find a bolt at
&gt;the hardware store (12mm) that is *almost* the correct size but
&gt;slightly smaller in diameter than the original bolt so there is
&gt;a little clunking when I go over bumps.

The DPO of my '64 didn't tighten the nuts all the way on the upper shock
absorber bolts.  This let the bolts slide back and forth and beat up
about half the thread on them.  When I got them out I noticed the heads
were marked &quot;12K&quot;, which in modern terms translates to &quot;10.9&quot;, a pretty
stiff metric bolt.  I replaced them with bolts from a junked Bus, that
were also marked &quot;12K&quot;.

The ones at the hardware store are likely &quot;8.8&quot; or &quot;9.8&quot; bolts, which
aren't quite as strong.  I don't know for sure, but the stiffer bolt
might also be that little bit bigger around the shank.

&gt;Does anyone know what the correct diameter of this bolt is and/or if
&gt;it might be reasonable to try to shim the bolt diameter with some
&gt;brass shim stock that I have (.003&quot; thick)?

I shimmed a bolt on the body end of a Panhard rod like this, but I
don't have any reliability data as the vehicle in question has only
traveled about 200 miles.
