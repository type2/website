&gt; What about the power circuit in the 30 pict-2?  This carb was made for 1600

&gt; WOT. Sounds like folks are not happy with the 30 pict-1 on DP's.  I think I 
&gt; am going to have a 30 pict-2 rebuilt to give it a try.

I only tried the generic H30/31 BOCAR (I think Bocar).  It came on an
engine I got.  I've never tried the pict-2, but it sounds like it's worth
a try.
