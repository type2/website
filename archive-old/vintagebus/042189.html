OK, I'll make it plainer.  No, I've never had a fuel filter leak.  I've
also never fallen off of a cliff, but I'm smart enough not to walk too
close to the edge even though no edge has ever failed under me or under
anyone I know.

I am well aware of what the signs of fatigue failure look like in plastic.
Seeing it once on my filter made me think &quot;hey, I got lucky this
time.&quot;  I'm not going to risk my bus by putting the part back in to make
sure that it fails completely in order to satisfy your quest for 
knowledge.

I've noted that most of the plastic fuel filters I've seen in stock
installations are securely mounted to the body in some sort of clip
arrangement.  Very seldom are they left dangling on the hoses.  Perhaps
the designers of such systems know something that we don't.  If they could
save a buck by not putting the fuel filter holder in the car, don't you
think they would do so?

If you want to base your safety decisions on an informal poll of 
a few bus folk, go right ahead, but don't be advising others based upon
such data. 99%+ of these filters will work fine, but if it's your bus that
is the exception you'll wish you hadn't been so cavalier about the
dangers.
