Subject: Rear main seal replacement??

Greetings listees,
 
I have several questions, but will start with some background info. I
recently got my bus back from the body shop (4 month visit) and am
having some severe oil leakage issues. Before I turned the bus over, it
was not leaking more than a few drops a day. On the contrary, it was
burning quite a bit, but that's not relevant to this situation and was
(supposedly) fixed while the motor was out. Anyway...
 
As of this evening, it was leaking from the valve cover on one side and
what appeared to be &quot;all over the bottom&quot;. Further research revealed
that one of the valve cover bales was a little weak. I bent it around a
bit and cured that problem. After wiping down the motor with a rag and
changing what was left of the oil, I fired it up and sat back to watch.
Not much activity until the motor warmed up a bit. At that point, it
started to leak aggressively on the drivers side of the case where the
trans connects to it. The oil was leaking from up high (out of sight
while lying on the floor) and running down on that side.
 
To the questions:
1) Is this indicative of a rear main seal failure?
2) Is this something that could have been damaged/dislodged during
removal or reinstall of the motor?
3) Is this (the seal) something that can develop a leak when unused for
a period of time?
4) If I need to replace this thing, is it a big deal?
 
Now to the venting! To say that I am a pretty upset that the motor was
not tested after install is an understatement. This type of leak would
be very unmistakable, since I managed to pump out 2-1/2 quarts of oil in
the first 10 miles that I drove. Luckily for me, a gas station was my
first stop and I noticed the Valdez trail behind me. I was able to put
it on a trailer, but shudder to think what would have happened othewise.
 
Your valuable input is appreciated, as always.
