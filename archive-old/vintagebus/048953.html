Hey All:

I need the following for my '59 Hardtop Deluxe:

1) Cargo floorpan section from the bulkhead back to the first frame 
     cross member, all the way across, side to side.
2) Both front cab floor corners

Obviously I need these out of a dry donor bus,  not that any of us promote &quot;just&quot; cutting up buses.  I've decided that I don't want to use aftermarket metal on this bus.  Any leads would be appreciated.

Robert
