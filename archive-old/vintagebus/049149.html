Only for the cynically amused... http://www.theonion_dot_com/onion3631/drive_short_bus_myself.html or just www.theonion_dot_com. 

I covered most of the internal surfaces of my '63 DC with quick-patch, a thick, tough sandwich of adhesive, rubber and very flexible aluminum. It's made to patch roofs and comes in 6&quot; wide rolls at home suppliers. Where the patch couldn't easily be stuck on, I slathered with clay based Henry roof patch. Then the NASA bubble/shiny stuff inside that. So the other morning, I was out in the truck battening down the safaris at 4:30 a.m. during a huge thunderstorm. The only rain noise came from the cowl vents, the only place that doesn't have the sound deadening.  I'll pull the panel and put some of the stuff there. 

Scott Fraser lent me his engine stand/starter for my T4 engine project. Bolted it on and Karl helped me lift it upright. Then the next morning, at the salvage yard, we come across a '73 bay T4 with the correct 210mm flywheel. The '78 2l T4 engine has a larger one I can't use in the DC's type 1 tranny. The engine was rusty, but the pressure plate and clutch disk looked nearly new and were German.  So $50 later, I'm a bit closer to solid AC power. Damn, I'll have to take the engine off the stand to put the flywheel on.  Monday, Karl reports  an auto shift bay in another salvage yard. Engine gone, but a nice starter with self supporting  gear (no bushing needed) is laying on the ground. So $20 later I'm even closer. 
Anybody else notice that a lot of salvage yard cars have a few newer parts here and there? The old &quot;nickel and dime to death&quot; theory. 

  Trivia.... What size wrench takes off a T4 flywheel?
