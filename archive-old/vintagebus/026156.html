Subject: Re: [VB] Barely a steering wheel...
Message-ID: &lt;3824E666.6DE6D5DB_at_vintagewarehouse_dot_com&gt;

&gt; i've got a steering wheel that's missing about 95% of the bakelite
&gt; material. Seriously, it's basically just the metal frame!
&gt;
&gt; Any suggestions?
&gt; Anybody done anything wierd with an old steering wheel?

I've had many of those. I took one and removed all the bakelite, did a nice
smooth curve at the outside edge of  the cross piece to the actual round part
you hold onto so it was a smooth transition. Then took just the outside lip
of a horn button base mounted it upside down in the center and was able to
put a complete horn button/base on top of that for a *very* different looking
wheel. I got quite a few compliments and where'd you get that from people. It
was familiar enough to look like some sort of VW made piece, but far enough
strange to make you wonder..........
