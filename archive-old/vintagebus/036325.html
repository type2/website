Message-ID: &lt;7kdt56$n8ko_at_eGroups_dot_com&gt;

i need some help in identifying the purpose of the stamped numbers in my piano hinge window frames in my 1951 23 window bus. the number stamped is 248. these frames were purchased seperate from the bus. does this number reference the body or chassis number from which the parts are from?
