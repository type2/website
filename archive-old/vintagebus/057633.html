&gt; Thing #1 - it needs a master cylinder. Ive changed these on bugs before and 
&gt; thought nothing of it, until seeing that its 1 yr only and $195 at 
&gt; bus-boys!  Im sure the seller had a laugh.. i didnt imagine this was the 
&gt; case. Anyone rebuild these? Its literally pouring fluid out of the shaft...

Hi Jason,
Definitely check out the type2 library for our 1972-79 MC conversion or check 
out Hemmings Motor News magazine for shops that bore, press in a stainless or 
brass sleeve, and rebuild your old brake cylinders.

&gt; thing #2 - Needs shift bushings, sloppy (doesnt pop out of any gears tho), 
&gt; one in the front, what about the coupler in the rear, where is it and how 
&gt; hard to get to? (whole job..)?

Someone else did a good write up on that!  It sounds like a huge amount of 
work, but it is well worth it when done and the shifting is so nice and 
tight.  Make sure to replace the shift tube end seals also to keep the new 
grease in and the dirt, sand, water out!

&gt; thing #3 - has the safari windows and a stock antenna. How do i bend the 
&gt; antenna to accomodate the safaris? should I take it to a machine/metal 
&gt; shop?  Just put it in a vise and overcompensate the bend to get it in the 
&gt; ballpark?  (it bends back).. any ideas?

It depends on which make of antennia and where it is mounted.  Easiest way is 
to center mount a two base antennia which will help lock your front emblem 
on.  Otherwise it is Hirshmann antennia time which have a wasp shaped solid 
metal at the base of the mast which is meant to be bent.
