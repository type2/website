Subject: Carb questions....

Oh wise list of never ending knowledge.......

Well, unfortunately I am not a carb expert and I have a motor that is 
causing me some difficultly.  It is a dual port 1600 (bug motor).  The 
problem is that if I want it to keep idling I have to have the choke on the 
standard carb almost completely closed.  When you open the choke the motor 
dies.  The motor runs like a raped ape when the choke is closed (although I 
do foul plugs...).   I am afraid that if I don't fix this problem it might 
grenade the motor.  If I open the choke part way and keep my foot in the gas 
the motor stumbles then comes to life and runs fine at high rpm 2500-3000.  
Once you let off it wants to die.

Any help would be great!
Thanks,
Mike
