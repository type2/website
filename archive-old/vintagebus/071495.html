&gt; The tank that is shown on their page looks a little small, I'm assuming
the
&gt; compressor runs continuously, what does it use for a bypass when the tank
&gt; is full and air is not being used?

It's too soon for me to provide statistics, I am in the
process of break-in and have been running in the
rings and valves, with the pump cylinders venting directly
out the spark plug holes.
I questioned the 10 gallon tank size with the designer,
and Larry convinced me to go with his reccommendation.
Normally, I am highly skeptical of advice from an &quot;idiot&quot;
which directly contradicts my analytical genious:)
As it turns out, you don't even need a tank !
And this tank size is optimal for the unit construction.
You may combine the dual outputs and run a hose directly
from the combined output of the two pump cylinders.

Now, here's the tricky part-and I can't explain it !!!
There is NO bypass valve, and there is NO hardware
provided for NO safety pop-off valve ! It's in the cam design.
When the tank is up to pressure, the pressure backs up
to the pump cylinders, and the engine just...slows...down!!!
It will not continue to build pressure past it's rated max of 120psi.
With constant supply of 58CFM, there is no need of higher
pressure with the volume available at sustained pressures
of 100-120psi through a 3/4&quot;i.d. hose.


&gt; Any comments on the air quality?
&gt; Moisture content?
&gt; Oil content?

I am using Total Seal (*tm) piston rings
for zero leak-down, to optimize power and
to keep the output air as clean as possible.
The tank has NO water drain valve !!
The tank air inputs are on the bottom.
