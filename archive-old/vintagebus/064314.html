Subject: Re: [VB] want to undercoat my bus for winter

As regards undercoat, I have sucessfully used
a gallon of plastic (not asphalt, not fiber) roofing tar
reduced with lacquer thinner for brush or spray.About 5 bucks.
Autobody supply stores sell a similar product ( and many others )
for more money.
Use a plastic drop under, plastic shopping bag
and a rubber band for head gear, and clothes to burn after.
Another popular choice is bar+chain ( chainsaw ) oil, which
must be reapplied infrequently. Whatever you choose, the surface
must be dry before application.

&gt; List,
&gt;
&gt; I posted this question on the type2 list last week but didn't get any
&gt; answers.  Thanks in advance for your help.
&gt;
&gt; I was wondering if there's something I can get like at Home Depot to
&gt; undercoat my bus and just apply it with a big paint brush to prevent my
bus
&gt; from rusting.
