George writ:
&quot;Having gone into more than one clutch simply because a clip popped off, I
recommend that you run a piece of safety wire around the groove in the throw
out bearing and through the holes in the clips. &quot;

Also small zip ties work great too :)

It is always a pisser to have the engine back in and than have the T/O
bearing fall out of place.

Stick with the stock clutch.  Should not need anymore &quot;grip&quot; from the disc.
Your only choice in my opinion is solid disc or spring disc... I always run
solid disc and have a light clutch with no harsh engagement.
