Subject: how come Mr merz has so many NOS part...

Ive been watching VW planet and other vw related auction site, and since some
year when i see something RARE and NOS usually its been sold by Mark Merz!

How the hell he got all this NOS stuff... is he so rich ?  Maybe he have a
gold mine somewhere ...
