Subject: underbody question
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

One more question: 
what would you do to the underneath if it was mint with just some peeling 
paint and road tar ??
do you think i should clean it and under coat it 
or clean it and paint it
or clean it and use something comprable to por-15

there is nothing there (rust) and i just dont want anything to start (rust).
BTW its a 60 with 32,000 mi  orig.
which will be put back into lite service in a few weeks.
thanks all
joe
