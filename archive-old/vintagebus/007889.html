the ones i get are good at the most and only late model
they look good and take a bit to fit, no they do not have the VW
stamped in them.

they are better then tabco's but a lot more money then their's

my sources overseas have been saving nos metal for me as they find it
to make templates off of, should have some real cool pieces when my
container (yes, container ) load of sheet metal arrives beginning of JAN.
Y2K as long as the ship doesn't sink new years eve!!!!
