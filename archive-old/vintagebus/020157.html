Then will you boycott Bad Camberg because it is sponsored by Lotterman's a VW dealer as well as his son Stefan who is/was working at VWoA.

Or Dave Crompton's Kubel or Schwimmer parts because he works as a consultant to VWoA and VW AG on some of their historical needs.

How about Vince and Lynn Anderson who work at VWoa are club members and do many things that give recognition to the ACVW hobby.

The guy who gave me a brand new parts fieche for my bus that worked at VWoA.

The dealer guys that would search for obsolete stuff for me and do keys and locks for free if I brought them in.

Flame me all you want but you need to come here and experince the show before you judge someone based on their leagl department.

VWoA is *using* the ACVW people who show up as poster children
to further their cause.   You're getting *tooled* by attending;
an unwitting PR prop, and like a drunk sorority girl, you'll be
dropped and forgotten until the next time you're needed.
