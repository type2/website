&lt;&lt;Not sure what the original question was but it looks like the nine-prong 
relay doesn't have anything to do with the high beams -&gt;&gt;
Hi Matt,
He was asking if cleaning and soldering all the rivet connection in the 
1955-67 bus headlight switch would solve his high beam problem.

&lt;&lt; If this wasn't what he was asking then please pardon the rude 
interruption.  :) &gt;&gt;
Hi Matt,
Thanks for the info!  We are not much into that late of bus.  So figured 
someone with more experience might add to our info or correct any mistakes.

PS.  While helping a 58 Westie owner during the last few days with his bus.  
Of the many problems he was having the dimmer switch was allowing 2.5 volts 
to the bright circuit when the dim circuit was turned on!  So he raced off to 
our FLACPS &quot;Bow Wow&quot; to buy a new dimmer switch.  He came back with a nice 
Brazilian switch that was made for SCREW TERMINAL without realizing it!  So 
took off the badly crimped on spade terminals (That had been previously 
installed to allow the installation of spade terminal connection type of 
dimmer switch.) off the three wires.  Two wires still had thier factory 
soldered wire ends and one had been cut off and left without solder.  
Soldered this last one and tried to install the new dimmer switch.  Wires did 
not fit, the holes were too small for the large wires!  Took out the screws 
in each terminal and then carefully drilled them open with very light 
pressure on the drill.  Had to be very carefull also to make sure not to go 
too deep!  Worked well and was nice to be able to install the proper switch!
