&lt;&lt; Executive summary:
 Get unscratched windshield glass whether OEM or recut.
 Background:
 When restoring the 67RFH, Paula and I decided to
 install the scratched original safari glass in lieu of
 having clean, clear, nice, freshly cut non-logo glass
 installed. Whoops! wrong decision...
 I think we had some unfounded fear that the mythical
 &quot;Vintage Nazis&quot; would send us to VW_Hell if we didn't
 have just the right logo. Keep in mind that those
 whacky Vintage Nazis wont be driving your beast on the
 next curvey two lane back roads at night in that
 rainstorm with the highbeamed head-on traffic coming
 at you and the impatient tweaker semitruck driver on
 your arse.
  &gt;&gt;
one thing I do is polish and wax my windsheilds.  yes this may sound wierd, 
but it really helps.  I just did it againthe other day on my westy, washed 
off the glass, and put polish on the glass and the bufffer on the drill and 
spun away at it for a bit.  washed that all off, and then waXED THE GLASS.   
now my old wipers swoosh the rain off much better, and less stuff glaring off 
the glass.  Though cracks and chips and grit scrathcing continus to happen, I 
got a rock chip drivers side in July, and the other day it started to curl a 
crack out through the glass.  hm..
