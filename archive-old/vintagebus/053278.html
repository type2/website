Subject: Re: [VB] Mt. Shast Snow Trip  &lt;Tire chain advice&gt;

Well tomorrow I am on the hunt at garage sales for my
set of chains. I do plan on bringing a shovel and also
hooking a tow strap to the beam of the bus before hand
so that I don't have to lie in the mud just in case.
Anyone else have any suggestions as to other stuff I
might need, I do have a list of my own, but I am sure
there is some stuff I may have overlooked. By the way,
is there any way to get a copy of that video??
 Mike

&gt; I know I have had chains 
&gt; that will fit the 14&quot;s but not the 15&quot; tires.  
&gt; 
&gt; I saw the video of last years crazy snow camping
&gt; trip which included lots of 
&gt; adventures and is not for the faint heated or those
&gt; worried about a scratch 
&gt; in the paint.  Bring shovels and plywood and someone
&gt; bring a rope and a come 
&gt; a long.
&gt;   Too far for me to go.    :(
