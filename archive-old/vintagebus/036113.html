Subject: bug not bus on GG Bridge
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

Hi again,
I finally saw the news.
It was a bug that someone tossed off the bridge.
They connected cable and nylon rope to both sides of the bridge and connected 
the body in the middle. So that when the body dropped off the bridge it was 
suspended right in the middle under the bridge.
Bridge workers said it was done before 4am this morning and it only took the 
people a few minutes to set up and drop the body.
Bridge workers cut the ropes and let the bug body sink into the SF Bay.
Probably not the only VW under water in there.
Hope everyone gets a chance to see the footage, it's pretty cool.
