i had almost the same problem, turned out to be the 
main power wire on the light switch, the connecter
had corroded away, and was makeing bad contact.
half as# fix, (was on the road) and off i went
3000 miles later same half as# repair and she's still 
running strong, no more electrical problems, yet!!!!

hey all,
i got a small problem... we are having unseasonably warm weather here
in 
Cleveland, Ohio and i wanted to take Tela for a spin last weekend. went
over 
to the free heated garage where she is and started her up. first time
she 
rumbled for about 5 seconds then quit. second time she did the same.
(normal 
after a few weeks of not running) third time while rumbling over she 
completely died! NOTHING, no idiot lights when you turn the key, no
head 
lights, brake lights, dash. the only thing that works are the hazards
and 
the cabin lights???? i think its that damn starter relay cuz no power
is 
getting back up front. anyone got any ideas? we got another few days of
nice 
weather ;) shes a bone stock '66 converted to 12V.
thanks first!!
