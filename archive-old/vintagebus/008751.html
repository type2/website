HI All
can I jump in tooo....
I guess that the original post about tanks being recommended to be used
upright should have read..... propane tanks should be used as intended,,,,
as that is really a vague statement.. I think that it is fair to say,,,
Please make sure you  transport and use a domestic_BBQ_tank_in_
an_upright_position,

There are tanks that MUST be used upright to draw the Vapour off the TOP of
the tank,,
i.e. BBQ style tank

BBQ tank valves are designed to give VAPOUR off the top..... heaters and
stoves etc use VAPOUR.
If you overfill or turn the tank on it's side,,, you will draw LIQUID off
and it has a nasty result!  The flame will FLARE !!
propane expands from a liquid to a gas ,,, the appliance that requires 1
unit of VAPOUR will get about 240 times that as the liquid expands to become
a vapour

other tanks MUST be used on the side to draw LIQUID off the bottom..  i.e.
forklifts
these tanks have an interesting valve tube that hooks over to the &quot;side&quot; of
the tank,(when it is upright),, making this really the &quot;bottom&quot; (when it is
used on its side)

there are other configurations too...

there is a valve that has an exension that goes all the way to the bottom of
a large tank, this allows the tank to remain upright and still draw a LIQUID
i.e. a roofers tar pot heater

You see,,, it depends on the valve that is used on the cylinder
The cylinders you are refering to, BBQ vs. Forklift tanks....have a
completely different fill style valve which allows the fuel to be taken off
in a different form
You can't  place a BBQ tank  on a forklift,,  as the fittings are different
for a reason,,,but if you did the results would be that the engine would not
get enough fuel  ,,, no big deal,  no real danger,
and in the reverse ....
If you put a forklift tank on a BBQ you would have Liquid at the burner at a
tremendous rate.  SUPER HIGH!

This would be a TIM TAYLOR hop up,,, get them steaks done quicker hu hu hu !

I know a guy who used to play with fire,,,, he made up an adapter,, so he
could &quot;borrow&quot; forklift cylinders from work,,,, and use them on his BBQ,,,,
by turning the cylinder upside down..... Theoreticaly correct.... but,,
come on over,,, I will show you what siding on a house looks like after a
FLARE UP EXTREME!!!  :-)

That is my 2 cents......
hope you all keep safe out there!!!!

&gt;
&gt;&gt;Except, of course, for those tanks designed to operate on their sides!
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;It's OK to transport a normal propane tank on its side with the valve
&gt;&gt;closed.  It must be upright to draw gas properly.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Hoo boy - I gotta jump in here on this one. :-)  If the tanks are supposed
&gt;to be kept upright, then why do forklifts, like the ones I use at work,
&gt;carry their tanks on their sides?
