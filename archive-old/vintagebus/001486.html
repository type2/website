Subject: I got my birth certificate!

Well, not my birth certificate, but my bus birth certificate from the
Stiftung AutoMuseum Volkswagen.  I found out some details that I hadn't
known before.

They pinpointed the day it was built as March 11, 1966 and the day it left
the factory was March 25, 1966.  Also, the import point was listed as
Baltimore/Philadelphia, and the birth certificate reflects Philadelphia.

My m-code plate lists 03 6 as the production date, so what they have listed
for dates is interested when added to the rest of the discussion on how
plates were assigned to individual buses.

So does anyone have engine number HO 095 239?
