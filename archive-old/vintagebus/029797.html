Subject: re:westy interior

I am now pretty sure it is a 70 z-bed. Also yesterday the guy I buy
parts from gave me  a walkthrough  front-rearfacing seat that someone
had given to him. It needs to be recovered and the top and front have
been painted white. Seems to me that since the front and top panels are
ruined already by the paint and it needs new cusions anyways, that I
should make longer panels using the existing panels as a template for
the front peice where it butts up to the edge of the wall of the bus and
the top for the hatch that opens behind the drivers head and use the
remaining parts to put together a non-walthrough seat. Is there a way to
match the veneer that is on the z-bed? or at least get close?
