Hi David,
Looks like a made to fit almost any car rack.  Not good for buses.  The feet 
on the roof tend to leave dents especially when loaded heavily.  Plus the 
added danger of when the roof flexes while loaded when going over bumps the 
straps loose tension, the hooks come off the underside of the gutter, and pop 
goes the rack!  The only way to insure that this probably would not happen is 
to tie the rack to the bus with ropes that go all the way under, and back up 
to the rack.  Or better yet invest in a rack that stands firmly in the rain 
gutter instead.
