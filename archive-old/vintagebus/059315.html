Subject: Re: Window scraper woes on 65 bus

&gt;From: &quot;Michael Heron&quot; &lt;Michael.Heron_at_mbs_dot_gov.on_dot_ca&gt;

&gt;I have found that with the new rubber scrapers installed the doors are now =
&gt;a total pain to open because the rubber binds making it very diffcult to =
&gt;open the door without a LOT of force.

Sheesh, what kinda idjit would own a 65 anyway?

I've got the same behavior on mine, although I *think* it's less of an issue over time.  It's weird - sometimes they stick quite a bit, otherwise not much at all.  Prolly 
temp and humdiddity related.  Scott Kausch trimmed them back on his Binz but went a bit too far, although IMO that's the only real solution -- make 'em shorter so 
they still seal but aren't quite as long.

I'd guess the real bind is the corner, where the edge has to &quot;flip&quot; when you open it and that's where it resists most.  Maybe notch/slice the corner with a razor so it's 
not a continuous flap?  Just an idea for an experiment....
