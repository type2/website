OK guys, I tried to get $25 or a pop-out window and frame for my 67 deluxe
for these cabinets, spice rack, fold out table and fridge but got no one
over to make the swap.  So.... the _first_ bus nut that gets over here to
come and help me clear some space in my garage by taking this stuff away is
welcome for whatever it costs you in gas to get over here.  These are not
Westy or Sundial or EZ as far as I can tell.  You can see them at
http://members.aol_dot_com/babalou467/67bus.html at the bottom of the page.
These cabinets were fitted in my bus _with_ the full rear bench.  The tall
cabinet/closet sat behind the drivers seat.  The table, fridge and spice
rack in the standard places.  I need the space more than these cabinets.
Anyone interested let me know and we'll set something up.  I'm in Fairfield,
CA.  About half way between S.F. and Sacramento on Hwy 80, nr Vallejo.
