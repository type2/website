Subject: Speedometer fix up

Well, I to miss a lot of the Bus goings on here, so I figure I'll chime in
on a project just completed.

My '66 Deluxe's speedo needed help, so I jumped right in, and decided it was
time to fix the missing light gels as well as the odometer.  Well, a couple
of nights work and presto, it looks like it did 38 years ago!

Basically, I used the colored gels from index file folders, cut them to fit
on the speedo, doubled them up for a darker color, glued on with 3m adhesive
and now, my turn signals, high beams, gen and oil light all look great and
are the correct color, not just a white light blaring back at me.

As for the odometer, it was simply just not adjusted correctly.  Loosen
screw, move gears into position, tighten up, and odometer works.  Wow, that
working is better than the gels.  Now I can figure fuel mileage and just
nice to know how far I go between tune ups now.

Well, just wanted to add a 'What I did to my Bus today&quot; to the list.

Thanks
