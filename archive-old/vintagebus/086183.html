Subject: Re: [VB] cleaning paint from trim

In a message dated 7/24/2006 10:19:36 P.M. Pacific Standard Time,

removing the paint and polishing them? &lt;&lt;
 
Hi Chuck,
Try 3Ms Safest Stripper.  No nasty fumes.  If that does not  work.  There are 
many paint stripper chemicals including ones that are for  aircraft, but they 
are not nice to deal with.
