Subject: Re: [VB] Should I Cut Up A Bus?


It's purely a matter of economics.  Can you get more for the bus
than the cost of good pieces from other already-junked buses?
Not to mention the value of your time, and all the social-engineering
you'd have to do to talk people into selling you the stuff?

When the value of complete commerical buses surpasses their parts value, they 
won't be cut up any longer.   Some people will cut up an split-window standard
to save a heb.

Until then, a lot of kombis and panels will die to save deluxes.
