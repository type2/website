Just back home from a terrific VW weekend.
Drove 750 miles, my last time driving Fafner before it goes away with its new 
owner next weekend. As usual, no problems of any kind. What a great vehicle it 
has been...
Anyway, here is a brief of my weekend:
I left Eugene after work on Fri. evening. No dog/wife this time. Slept in a 
nice and quiet rest area about an hour south of Seattle, right next to another 
Westfalia. Arrived to the VINTAGE MEET very early, had to wait until they 
actually opened...As always, very nice vehicles and a pretty siginificant swap 
activity. I found original gray kick panels, a Westfalia table and window for 
my '65 bus. I also bought the 100,000 mile dealer badge. I saw Craig, Terry 
and some more wetwestians swapping and wondering around. Didn't see Luke or 
Robert.
I took off early and had my urban experience walking downtown Seattle, which I 
enjoyed very much except for the outrageous parking prices...I refused to pay 
double digit prices, so I ended up finding a spot right next to the Space 
Needle after 10 minutes of wondering around.
I then headed south on I-5 and slept in a nice park close to SIR (Seattle 
Int'l Raceway). I spent this morning there. The swap area was not as big as I 
had been told, but still managed to find a couple of interesting vintage 
items. I left early due to low activity in the swap area and the noise 
generated in the drag area (not my thing).
And now comes the weekend's highlight (for me): I checked out a one-owner '66 
Westie that I had been after for some time. It was very complete (walk-through 
bench, child's cot, tent, roof rack), and original (velvet green paint, 
cabinets, paperwork, 6v, 1500 motor, window sticker, tool kit, spare 
Continental tire, etc.). Couldn't resist it and ended up buying it!! I'll pick 
it up next week and drive it to its new home in Eugene. I can't believe that 
I'll be only the second owner. It comes with photos of when it was picked up 
in Germany and traveled around Europe, freight from Le Havre to NY paperwork, 
european insurance paperwork, german tourist (oval) license plates used, and 
ALL maintenance records from '66 to date (most of them in the same 
VW-authorized shop). Drives pretty good, needs a brake job. There is also this 
matching homemade'60s porta pottie, very similar to the old Westfalia bucket 
accessory. There is some rust and dents, but nothing I can't live with. I will 
keep this bus as original as possible, concentrating on enjoying it and 
keeping it in top mechanical shape. I am still very excited and happy with 
this find, a definite keeper. The VW gods are compensating me for the loss of 
Fafner, I guess...
I am hoping to bring the bus to one of the next WetWesties' campouts.
