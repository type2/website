 hi dan and all listes.i hade a wolfgang disc conver,the wheels stuck out
so far that they rubed bottom egde of dog leg.i dont recomend this as i
threw the kit in a dark corner.my latest find is a well preped kit from
oldspeed.hot vws mag articale august 98 issue.the kit contains two brand
new german porsche 911 rotors,two rebuilt calipers,brake pads,1set of
bearings,brackets,hoses,and master cylinder to fit.all though it is small 5
pattern to run alloys.it keeps the wheels in stock location.a very nice
kit.but hence the draw of not a wide 5 bolt pattern.as i spoke with them
the kit cost about 850.00 rebuilt rotors are about a hundred dollars less.i
have been on the list for some time.but yet to have ploblems myself but i
have helped a few members in locating some parts from my web siteplease
take a look at http://home.inreach_dot_com/vwfreak  source for disc old speed
