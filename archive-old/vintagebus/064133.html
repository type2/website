Subject: Pedal push rod rubbers

I bought some new push rod rubbers for my pedals - I think they are NOS as the
have the VW logo and the part number 211 721 387 on them.  I have no idea how
they should be fitted though?  They are pretty tight on the shaft of the
rubber, and they appears to be no way to retain them onto the cab floor.
Therefore I assume that they are fitted underneath as I have the felt glued
down above.  Is this correct?

Thanks
Paul
