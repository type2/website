Subject: Re: [VB] Long block vs turnkey

Hi Dave,
Cooling fan, fuel pump, thermostatic flaps, muffler, air cleaner, Heat  
exchangers, accelerator tube through shroud, oil cooler, fan shroud (preferably  
dog house style), fresh air tubes with hose clamps, connection pipes - heater  
pipe, preheat piping to carb, gen tin, gen strap, etc....
If you can not or do not have the time to build an engine yourself.   Get the 
longblock and put all the parts on yourself.  That way the engine  will have 
that much less mystery in your future when you need to work  on it!!
