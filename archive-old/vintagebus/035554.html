&lt;&lt; Hi, speaking of interior panels,  does any know where to get front door
 panels with the opening (or pocket) in them? Either the grey kombi style
 or the colored vinyl standard bus style?  Thanks.
  &gt;&gt;
I dont know if anyone does them.   I like the pockets and am going to put a 
pocket in the door panel for my 65.
