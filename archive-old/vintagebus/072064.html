Hi Jason,
Thanks!

&gt;&gt; I've enjoyed reading your answers to all of the questions. I was 
wondering, as I read &gt; this post, what is the difference between a bus rim, and a bug 
&gt; rim?  Are they interchangeable? I better check mine! LOL..

The type 1 rim is narrower than the type 2 rim.  Todays radial tires of a 
diameter that are as close as possible to the original stock bias plys and O'dark 
early radial our pre-1968 buses came with from the factory, are unfortunitly 
made for todays wider automotive rims!!!!  In otherwords using bus diameter 
sized radials of today on pre-1968 bus rims are narrower than the radial 
manufactures recommend as is, going to bug rims would be worse.  Using a type 1 
diameter sized radial tire (Usually rated for 1200 Lbs. or less!!) on a type 1 rim 
more than likely would be wieght rated way below the pre-1968 bus 1525 Lbs. 
minimum and thusly would cause the bus to sway and automaticly change lanes at 
highway speeds due to cross winds and semi-truck bow waves as they pass you.  
  Additionally the type 1 rim has a differant offset than the type 2 rim and 
this will probably reduce RGB bearing lifespan because the tire will not be 
centered under the RGB bearings.  We did the same by adding Corvette style 
tire/rims with wheel adapters to a 1970 bus widening the wheel base and resulted in 
30,000 mile or less rear axle bearings instead of the normal 200,000+ 
lifespan!  OOOOPsss!!  Type1 rims narrow the wheel base and thusly increase slightly 
the tip overablity of the bus.
