&gt;Might be best to have 2 people, 1 driving and 1 logging data.

This is a very good idea.  I can just about handle glancing at a laptop
(that is already logging data) occasionally while driving an automatic.
If I need to type on it, I have to pull over.  For instruments that
require more fiddling, or manual recording of data, having two people
is a must.  At TU, when the Automotive Design students are doing the
coast-down (rolling resistance) testing on their own cars, they are
required to have a driver and a data-taker - not allowed to do it solo.
