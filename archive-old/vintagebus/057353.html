Subject: Re: [VB] tranny drain plug trick

What I do is root around in the junk box for a 17mm
hex nut, then use a small 3-sided file to square out
the hole in the middle.  Then, you can slip it onto a
3/8&quot; socket extension, put it on the ratchet, and go.

&gt; For $1.16 I made a little tool today to get the

&gt; 
&gt; 1 - 3&quot; Automotive bolt with a 17mm head
&gt; 2  17mm nuts
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; The two nuts lock each other, so vise grips on the
&gt; bottom one loosens, on the top
&gt; one, tightens
&gt; Not one flaps, or even VW dealer even knew what I
&gt; was talking about
&gt; when I asked about a 3/8 17mm hex socket.  The
&gt; Foriegn Flaps guy said
&gt; &quot;you'll never find anything like that out here&quot;
&gt; (CT).  So I made this little thing and it's worked
&gt; good so far. Will still order the socket from
&gt; someone for safe re-tightening
&gt; 
&gt; Just thought I'd share my small triumph
