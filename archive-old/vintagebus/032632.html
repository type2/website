i dunno, maybe my soda-chugging (now pc corrected to &quot;fruit juice&quot;),
chocolate gobbling (not pc modified), no-sleep-'till-brooklyn style of
driving just gets me there faster.  i don't drive over 65, but then i pee,
eat, and whatever else all at once at the same stop, and don't rest for a
half hour when my butt starts to hurt a little.  everett, maybe this 36hp
header i have for you will improve your top speed and cut some time off
your travels. 
a/c is for chevy's, i drive a BUS! (and yes, i've driven across the mojave
in my bus when it was 120-that's what the radio said-a few times, so i know
what hell is!)

&gt; the bus-snob sez:
&gt; &gt; 12 hours?  12 hours?  what are you driving, a tricycle?  even my bus
won't
&gt; take 12 hours,...
&gt; It took me 12 hours last year to drive back from slightly north of LA to
&gt; Phoenix, this is about the same distance from LA to Sacramento.
&gt; It was real hot in the desert, I felt like I was in hell. (more than
usual)
&gt; 
&gt; I saw another AZ person towing their Bus back with their air-conditioned
&gt; modern pick-up, they had driven the Bus to all the events all weekend.
