&lt;&lt; One other thing you may want to be sure of.  When you cut new gaskets for 
an 
 intake manifold, make sure you cut the large hole in the center, not just 
 the holes for the bolts around the edge.  Had me stumped for hours.
  &gt;&gt;

I don't get it- cut gaskets for a manifold?   where the manifold goes to the 
head it is a round crush o ring, or for a DP the metal raised squash gasket.  
to the heat risers I haven't cut gaskets, used the metal sandwich type.
