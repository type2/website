Subject: Re: [VB] Type IV oil cooler conversion Q.
To: thom_at_calweb_dot_com, vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

For variuos reasons I have run all thes ethree types on my 65 .  The bus came with the type3 one, but I wanted to have an L shaped deflector on their (aka hoover bit) which did not fit with the sender for the type 3 guage.   I switched to the type 1 doghhouse a while after I had the bus, and there didn't seem any difference in cooling. Fits same no modification to tin to run the type 1 or 3 cooler.  
Anyway, last summer I switched to the type4 doghouse, which did mean modification had to happen.  Seems to run about 10 degrees or so cooler F.

Does this go on a doghouse or &quot;normal&quot; cooler?   Any more details?

&gt; a T3 oil cooler.  It requires less tin modification (just cut a slot for
&gt; the oil pressure sender boss) and has more cooling per square inch than
&gt; the t1 cooler, but its the same size...
