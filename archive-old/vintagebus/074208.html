yes, you can, and should, run a 205 distributor, especially if you do a lot of
stop and go driving. The vacuum port on the side is the correct one. I don't
know what altitude you are at, but here at sea level and mountainous area I
would run a 121 main in a transporter to keep from being too lean. If you were
a bug a leaner jet on the lighter body wouldn't bother me. Just my opinion.

Can I run an original 205M dizzy with a &quot;new&quot;
Brosol30/31PICT? Which vacuum port do I use? The one I think
I should use (left side) looks really tiny... The engine is
a 1600sp, runs well but only just breaks 20mpg with a 115
main jet.
