It's official - I'm going!

Tonight I did a hurry up job of:

Pulling ratio rockers and putting stock ones back on.  Reshimed and
readjusted valved.  Re-did #4 exhaust - too loose - my fault.
Found out reason for lack of power - adjustor nut on #4 exhaust backed all
the way out - exhaust barely opening - explains noise and dead cylinder
situation.  Dent in valve cover but no hole.  Still leaking oil in several
places.  So what - oil's cheap and I wanna go.

Pulled plugs - looked light tannish on the insulator but was told that 125's
might be a little lean.  Beings I've traveling in the heat tomorrow, I mic'd
an SAE drill bit that happened to be within .0015 of a 130 main fuel so I
used the dremel and drilled out my jets.  Smells just a little rich at idle
but not bad.  I'd rather run rich on this trip than too lean.  I can always
add a 200 A/C to thin the fuel out.

Took bus for test drive - POWER like you wouldn't believe - engine, bus, and
I are experiencing major karma!  Test drive to airport and back wonderful!
Stop for fuel and enthused man remarks about nice old van.  Talk for 10
minutes and leave on good terms.

Custom bumper stickers adorn side and rear of bus.  You'll have to come find
me to check them out.  It's 10:00 and I've got to start packing yet!!!  This
will probably be my last mail until after the event.  If you really need or
want to contact me, you can call until about midnight CST at 402-228-2462.
TTYL!
