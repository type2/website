Hehe!  Saw that many times when I was in the fire service - too many late-night
car fire explosions on TV...  Never figured out why people would believe
when a car ran into a structure, both would be engulfed in a fireball 
that would level a city block...

&gt; Years ago my friend Steve's Baja's engine catches fire, no extinguisher! He
&gt; immediately pulls over and screams &quot;its gonna blow&quot; we bail out and take off
&gt; running. Only seconds pass and this old lady pulls up in a bay window gets out
