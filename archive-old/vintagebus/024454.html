Subject: Drakula's rear end

Kyle--thanks for you insight on Drakula's rear end  &amp;  the great rear
bumper caper!!
I have seen a ribbed NOS TRUCK bumper--i know in Pomona on &quot;bus row&quot;
this becomes a very heated subject--But it seems when it comes to early
vw parts--and someone says --no such thing!!!   out it comes from some
vintage stash in NOS form!! I was almost was afraid to get into this
one--but all i DO know--is that this is the rear Bumper that came with
Drakula when he left the Frickinger coachworks--BUT it does NOT mean it
is the bumper that left the VW plant!!! The VW German bus friend that i
purchased Drakula from has given me the complete history of Drakula--all
that can be said about Drakhla's rear end is &quot;That's the way it came&quot;!!
