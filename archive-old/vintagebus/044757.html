Theres two different styles of side steps.
One for a belly pan bus, one without.
Slightly different frameing.

&lt;&lt;My recent purchase of a 63  23 window shows it has an ambulance step.  M530
i think--is this just a foot operated side step? or the same as an ambulance
step?  as of now i'm just working with photos--The bus is 100%
original--documented.
Still need to get it from Ohio to Phoenix?  PLMK if anyone can help -- it is a
great driver--But i prefer to have it towed--thanks--TWWM, uj
Our 62 Herbey will soon be surrounded by 3 splitties
