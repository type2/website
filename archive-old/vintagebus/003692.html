Subject: Another Panel Bus Question
Date: Sun, 8 Oct 2000 14:24:24 -0500
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

Did ALL panel vans have the upper vents in the body? Because mine doesn't
have these, and it doesn't look like they ever had them. What gives? I've
seen busses both earlier and later model busses (1964) than mine with the
vents. Is it because mine is a double door?

Thanks in advance
