Subject: bus did not fall over
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

In spite of the 7.0 (?) earthquake this morning, my 53 did not fall over.   
It is on 3 wheels, as I am trying to remove the Left front shock w/o snapping 
the upper bolt.  Like I did on the right side.  so the penetrating oil and 
tap method is the daily ritual.  Have the wheel off, and bus sitting on a 
jackstand and the jack still under the front beam, with the tire under the 
bus.  Of course, the shock waves rolled from the north, where the bus' butt 
was facing, if the waves came side ways, it may have been trickier.
