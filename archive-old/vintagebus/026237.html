I am paying $35/rim for sandblasting/zinc primer/powder coating - so that
sounds right on.  Only I'm getting mine done in Signal White.

&gt; Now off to the tire shop to pick out some rubber. What do you think 185's or
&gt; 195's for the old 59' panel?

My 66 will be running the Yokohama Y370 19575R14 tires, just sent my order in
to the Trie Rack today.
