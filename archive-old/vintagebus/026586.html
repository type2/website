    I saw this vehicle several years ago sitting in a field outside this
guys house...

    It is an early '55 &quot;Barndoor&quot;, no overhang over the windscreens.
Had correct Bus semaphores, early euro headlight lenses, 3-spoke Banjo
steering wheel, fairly decent gates, 16&quot; wheels (he had 6-8 + a
couple-3,4  15&quot; as well).

    Was missing rear engine hatch (I suppose a later SC hatch would do),
and right side treasure chest door.  I don't recall whether he had the
rear taillight lenses or not (most of the stealable stuff was in boxes
in the Barn)

    I've heard that the bus has since been moved inside his cavernous 3
story Barn, but I haven't talked to this fella in a couple years...  At
the time he did not want to sell the Bus as it had been given to him by
a recently deceased good friend...  He told us that when he pulled it
out of the storage shed where the SC had been stored for 10 years, he
thought it was going to break in half...  Frame near rear torsion tube
looks like swiss cheese...

    Nose and Cab area were pretty decent back then, but the frame
rust/condition prevented me from actively pursuing it...

    He also has a '67 SC that he was restoring to daily driver status to
use in his carpentry business as well as 4-5 early Split &amp; Oval
Beetles.  He has advertised a '54 Beetle in the same place for $1200
(completely disassembled, and some pan work completed), but don't recall
which one it was...

    If anyone is interested, I can probably get some pics posted to my
new website within a couple weeks or so...

    Not associated with the seller, I've just seen his vehicles in the
past!
