1.  PPG.  I have shot this brand before.  It is about $330/Gal for
Sealing Wax Red (SWR)  They have the exact L codes
2. Du-Pont.  I have not shot this brand.  It is aobut $315/Gal for SWR.
They do not have the right L codes though.
3. Glasso.  Have not used, but is the VW factory brand.  $345/Gal.  They
have the exact L codes.

All are Acrylic Eurithane.  Has anyone out there shot any of these?  Any
input on results or quality of product.  Right now i am apt to go with
Glasso.  I may pay an extra $50, but i know that i will get the right
colors.

I used PPG for my Velvet Green/Blue White 65 Westy.   It cost a lot less than
the prices for SWR, but I have heard that red is a pricier colour.  Worked
well on my bus.   Looks really close to the original.     Mixed to L  code,
then had the paint guy compare to a non sun faded polished bit of original
paint and make a small adjustment.     But It is so hard to say what is
original exactly, as paint colours change after 30 + years, it made my eyes
and mind spin.   The white came out too green and I took it back and they
remixed it and we repainted it.   (refer to January's saga of painting Nellie
for details)  

I don't know much about paint guns.

My last bit is that the prep work makes the paint job.  If I had spent another
week on Nellie, she would look much better.  But she's so much better than
before.

BTW, I found out some about websites, and it may be coming soon, but don't
hold your breath.   Included would be before, during after pics of Nellie,
Chris sanding the roof, and me with bondo dust in my hair.      Wooo-
yah!Suggestions and comments would be  appreciated.
