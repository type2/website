Subject: Re: [VB] SW Gas Instant  Heaters

 I think you are right about the BN4 being the most
popular. The heater shouldn't come near that
sheetmetal and it doesn't go too far left of the
motor. Where are you trying to put it?

&gt; &quot;Instant Heater&quot; in their bus.  I have seen a few
&gt; for sale but can't seem to find near as much info on
&gt; these as on Eberspachers.  Anyone have details or
&gt; stories to share about using the Instant Heater in
&gt; their 12 Volt bus?  What was the heater most
&gt; commonly use in 71 Westy's?  I thought it was the
&gt; BN4, so I bought one.  But after looking at the spot
&gt; to left of the engine compartment where it should
&gt; go, there does not appear to be enough room to mount
&gt; a BN4 here because of the spare tire well inside the
&gt; back compartment protrudes down into this space. 
&gt; Can anyone enlighten me??
