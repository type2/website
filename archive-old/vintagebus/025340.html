I load my single cab every Sat. with a display stand, table, and lots of
European style hearth breads, cinnamon rolls, brownies, scones, and the
like and go to our wonderful farmers' market and try my darndest to not
bring any back to my husband's bakery. :-)   ('cept the truck, of
course!) Not only have I created a few bakery addicts, but the truck has
converted more than one cool driver to a *way* cool driver.  :-)
