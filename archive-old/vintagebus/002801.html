Hey list

So I got my front wheel off there is grease all over my break shoes!  The
shoes have very few miles on them so I kinda hate to through em away.  Is it
possible to clean them?  Can I put gas on them and light them?  I just hate
to through away these becuase there is so much wear left.  But I also am not
prepared to risk life and limb for the price of a set of break shoes.

TIA
