 We had better let that subject die to keep peace.  That was a rant from 2 weeks ago.

&gt; I disagree, John. Until recently I only dissaproved of the hippy bus 
&gt;thing in private untill I was flamed by a couple of the &quot;peace and love&quot; 
&gt;crowd for deciding to remove the hippy graphics from my bus to restore it. 
&gt;Since then I have been on the anti-hippy crusade with a vengance. I dont 
&gt;mean to stir up the pot again and I agree that we should probably change 
&gt;the subject, as we can never reach a consensus on the subject and we will 
&gt;only cause hard feelings. And of course you all read the flames that I 
&gt;published from last weekend. (from an obvious hippy bus fan). The &quot;Tie 
&gt;Dyed Dead Heads&quot; are not any better than the rest of us.

Its your bus do what you want EXCEPT LOWER IT. (Smile, Im joking. Do what 
your heart desires) And thats where ya know they arent hippies. How could 
they complain?
It annoys me to no end that people who profess themselves to be hippies are 
TELLING OTHERS WHAT TO DO!

Would they have liked it if VW said &quot;NO STICKERS OR IT VOIDS YOUR 
WARRANTEE&quot;? Of course not.
