 &gt; &quot;Thick as toothpaste&quot; and &quot;never hardens&quot;, that sounds scary! Especially
 
 
 Why does that sound scary? It works perfectly. &quot;thick as toothpaste&quot;
 describes how it comes out of the tube, and &quot;Never hardens&quot; does not mean it
 doesn't dry! It means it remains flexible, even at high temperatures.

ya, placeIusetoworkused some never hardening sealant, except their's was 
orange.   So that's what I used on the case halfs. it was really nice, actually.
