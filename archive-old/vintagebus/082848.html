&gt;Come enjoy the first VW campout of the year, get out of the cold 
&gt;weather and come on down to Buses By the Bridge-IX at Lake Havasu 
&gt;City, Az. The campsite is beautiful with grass, trees, beach by the 
&gt;lake and it's located close to downtown Havasu stores and hotels!



sadly, my wife's work has decided to post us to MINNESOTA in january. AGAIN.
