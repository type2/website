Subject: Re: [VB] good deal!!!

First let me say anyone that thinks that bus is a basket case is totally
spoiled. I haven't  had one that decent in the shop in a long time. That is
the lighter side of normal for the east coast. I admit the cargo floor is a
bit much but hey,  They aren't  reproducing  complete buses and we gotta
work with what we can dig up. One company i used to work for always told us
when we were complaining about the way we had to do something&quot; If it was
easy monkeys could do it&quot;,, i hated the hell outta that.  whoever bought
that bus is not hurt in my opinion. later
