Go to this URL and then almost all the way to the bottom of the page.  I've
had several people ask me how to get the CD after the post was made telling
how so here it is one more time, click on the above URL and follow the
directions.  Ron is trustworthy and fast so don't hesitate to give him your
check info if you wish to pay via direct withdrawal - I love it.
