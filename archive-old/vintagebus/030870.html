Personally, I wouldn't go on a trip without it. You can get help in a
emergency, find out where the police is at, get road conditions, ect. Or just
to chat with someone to pass the time:)

In the B*g we had a Cobra 29, tweaked &amp; peaked, running thru a Texas Star 350
watt bi-linear amp w/102 inch steel whip antenna... could talk for more than 50
miles.
You can bet when the SC gets done, it'll have a similar setup.

&gt; I am wondering how many people run CBs in their busses to communicate while

&gt;
&gt; I have one sitting on the shelf and would like to know if it is worth
&gt; putting in the bus....  Also where do you put the antenna?
&gt;
&gt; The CB in my truck has been great, so if you all use them I will install
&gt; mine.
&gt;
