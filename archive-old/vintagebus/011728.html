Sounds like you need a change of (automotive) scenery, a new challenge,
something to grab your interest. That is as long as it's made in Germany
and rear engine! How about a 356 Porsche or a crew cab (water or air
cooled) or even a  Vanagon Westfalia (gasp!). Check it out.
Drive Safely &amp; Good Luck

&gt;I also found myself wandering around the garage floor in circles. &gt;I've
done the engine pull numerous times over the last 9 years, &gt;but my heart
doesn't seem to be in it. I don't know if I'm going &gt;crazy or just don't
have the karma to deal with this right now. &gt;... but the carrot doesn't
seem to be working.
&gt;
&gt;So if you have any extra Karma to spare, can I borrow some?
&gt;
