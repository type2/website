I went to bed very tired last night with no email. I
woke up this A.M. and the box was nearly full! We got
slammed with email. Thanks to everyone for the nice
messages.
To answer the most common question...
Sleep? ha!
There was a preventative wisdom to focusing on campers
and trailers. Hopes are that we can take turns
crashing and locking ourselves in the Puck and sneak a
nap out of earshot. (I won't count on it for a
second). =)
End the thread and thanks!
