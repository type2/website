Subject: Popout window rubber
To: mayesd_at_eou_dot_edu, vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

Does anyone know whos making the best pop-out window rubber?
I got some from a &quot;obsolete&quot; supply house and was very dissapointed with the 
was the seals were &quot;glued&quot; together. 
I remember buying some a few years ago and was very happy with the quality.
Not sure where they came from, i *thought* it was WCM but i saw theirs were 
poorly glued together.
What do WW seals look like?
ANyone?
Thanks-
Greg
