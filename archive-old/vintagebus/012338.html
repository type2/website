I don't think what we are saying is that the company doesn't 
contribute to the furtherment of the VW.  I think some of these
guys are stone geniuses.  the Pauters have no peers.  Gene Berg
has become God incarnate.

BUT I talked with Gene a number of times, and while his demeanor
was very straight forward and one of no bull, his business sense never
was one of looking down his nose at taking my money.  

What I'm saying here, (and this started with CB Performance) is that
every time I've spoke with the Pauters, I've come away feeling like my
business was appreciated.  Every time I've dealt with Mr. Berg, or Clyde
Berg, or Ms. Dee Berg, even when we had a problem, I have felt like they
respected me, and wanted to serve me as their customer.  I've met a great 
number of people in this business that have been like that.  And I go back
to
them, over and over again.  I spend my money with them.  They may look at
me like a bug that they could squash and sweep away with one stroke.  But 
they don't ever let me know that, they treat me with respect, as their 
customer.  And that's what we are talking about.

It's just like this:  What if I'm out on a road trip and I spin a rod
bearing?
The local FLAP and machine shop won't have a part to fix what I got 
wrong.  But Berg will, or RMMW will, or someone from the magazine
will, and will ship it overnight if it's in stock.  I know that because
I've
worked with these guys, I won't get attitude. I know I can depend on them
when I need them.

CB Performance just went into the column of the one's I can't depend on.
All I can expect from them is to get called &quot;Son of a Bitch&quot;, and then hung
up on.  Is that what I or anyone else on this list wants to hear from
someone
who we are giving our hard earned wages to?

BTW, Pauter makes a shroud fan that is better than OPP, just because it's 
the Pauters.

We have the mass to make a difference.  Our medium here has power, if we
want it to.  By myself, I'm only one customer.  If they loose me, it's no
big
deal. The next guy fills my place.  But if they loose the members of this
list, it will take a number of John's off the street to fill the void. 
That's 
a deal.  Maybe he can make it up with people who aren't on lists of any
kind, but maybe it changes his vision.

Just my humble opinion...

Cecil
