I have an Ingersoll Rand that's rated for 450ft/lb.   I bought mine at
the &quot;Air Tool Store&quot; in Sacramento, for $150

Don't cheep out in this area.  You don't need a Snap-On or some such
high-end jobbie, but don't go for the &quot;Allied Pneumatic&quot; HF brand either.
I've found IR to be a great compromise between quality and price.

&gt; rear drums, fly wheel flange nuts, lug bolts, fan / generator nut yada

&gt; What places on line are good to buy said impact?
