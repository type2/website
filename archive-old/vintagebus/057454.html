july vwt, interveiw states&quot;it would beirresponsible for vw's current buiseness to devote too many resources celebrating thepast.we must concentrate on today's products and customers&quot; they just don't furcking get it, same ole song and dance from them.how they can think that a person thinks that wolfgang international is associated with the vw factory because they have a single cab with a vw emblem on it is way beyong my comprihetion. one thing i do know is that i have a 1961 vw single cab, 2001 nissan xterra, 2001 nissan pick up all in my garage and not a single water cooled vw, but i'm a customer of the past , and {i won't say never} but it will have to be a heck of a deal to ever buy a vw that was made after 1967, paul
