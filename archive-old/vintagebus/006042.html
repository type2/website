&gt; Now, someone tell me what colours those are that Woody has on his panel.
I
&gt; love it...they go very well together.
&gt;

Thanks,mouse grey and pearl white.
    I do feel guilty about this restoration, as I'm not doing anything.
I have three kids and a wife, and a business to run.I have two buses and
a bug to maintain(soon to be three buses).The other two buses I've done the
lions share of work to.
But this one I am looking at all the pretty pictures and sending checks to
SoCal.
I know I'm rationalizing,but I need to fend off the guilt.
    Things still to be done to the 61.
BRM's painted mouse grey to be installed.
Vintage style lettering with my business logo, address , and website address
etc..
Also,I will be paneling the cargo area with Baltic birch.
    Lenny is used to doing stock restorations.So I am pushing the envelope
a little with him(a lot).I am going to be driving this bus everyday (except
in snowy / salty
weather) so I want it to be comfortable and make a positive statement
towards my
business.
Nazi flame suit on.
