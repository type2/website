Subject: Re: [VB] the Term &quot;Split Window&quot;

&gt; I don't like, and very rarely use, the terms &quot;Split Window&quot; or &quot;Splittie&quot;
&gt; Early buses came first.  They are buses.  Bay window buses are ... bay window
&gt; buses.  The term &quot;split window&quot; implies that they have to be distinguished
&gt; from buses - but they are buses.

I think that it's futile to argue semantics.  Split-window and Baywindow
are convenient terms to describe the two major groups of VW buses.

Then there are subgroups, such as the barndoor splitwindow and the early
bays and late bays.

They are just words, use and enjoy them as needed.
