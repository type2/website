Hi list.
Got a 67 westy so-42, original interior , leaky windows and rusty rockers.
original motor, replaced carb and runs fine everyday even in the Kansas
cold, will start resto in the spring. This is my first running splittie bus
but have owned 6, 60's busses non running in the past and a dormmobile, but
all were way far gone with severe crusties all around. Also have a 64
standard and 67 deluxe non sunroof, but still havent transported them to my
house yet ,cant wait. still have many good parts on them and the bodies are
almost rust free as they sat under a barn overhang for many years. 64 still
has org motor and has never been pulled or modified and not missing a single
original nut or bolt. These busses will be saved from the rust gods out
there waiting to spring on unsuspecting type 2 metal.
