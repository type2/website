Subject: 1500 and 1600 interchangeability

Hi all - What, if any components from an H case sp 1500 with an 
alternator can be fitted on a new 1600 dp longblock?  Here's my 
situation:

I have two complete motors in the garage.  One is an H case 1500 sp 
with a single carb,  vac advance, good heater boxes, new muffler,  fuel 
pump, and alternator -  runs strong with good compression,  but is of 
unknown origin, since it came in the dblcab I bought last May.  I 
popped it in my 65 EZ Camper, and drove it around town all summer.

The other is an X case type3 motor 1600 dp, with dual Kadrons, and a 
full flow oil filter.  This one ran rough when I last ran it about 2 
years ago, compression in the high 90's and 100's, 009, old generator, 
rotted heater boxes, holy exhaust, etc.

What I would love to do is get a rebuilt 1600 long block from one of 
the well respected builders mentioned on the list, and then keep one of 
these two motors as a &quot;spare longblock&quot;, and use some of the parts like 
the tin, fan shroud, carb(s) etc. on the rebuilt long block.

One of these complete motors will be sold to help finance the new 
longblock.

All the different options for what I can do are making my head spin

Any advice is appreciated
