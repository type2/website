I just purchased a 63 bus that I believe to be a sundial conversion, when 
the sundial company cut into the Panel vans side to put the windows in, did 
they pay much attention to craftsmanship? What I am asking is what does the 
connection detail look like between the camping windows, and the openings 
for the windows in a sundial. Also the bus came with a set of tailights 
above the usual tail lights, I checked them out and they look like they were 
done to well to be home done, they are round, does anyone know what they 
are, maybe backing lights, there are no lenses on them. It also had a gas 
heater I would like to sell, make an offer.
