Volks,

I am in the process of rebuilding my first type1 engine (for the '67 :-)
in 20 years... talk about deja vu! :-)  Amazingly I came across an &quot;H&quot;
case (1500 SP) that had never been bored.  It is now align bored for the
first time (20 over), sitting on my dining room table and I am staring at
it at every meal :-)  This causes much cogitation on engine rebuilding as
I eat (probably not a good thing :-) 

In reading up I ran into Bob Hoover's posts on painting the P&amp;C's, and I
certainly intend to do that, after washing them :-)  As I stare at it,
tho, I think of the posts I have read thru the years on heat transfer in
air cooled engines.  The gist of half a dozen posts I have read is that
the sump is a major cooling area on the air cooled engine.  I know that
the P&amp;C's is where most of the heat is generated, so getting rid of it at
the source is a good thing!  The other source tho, and the other sink for
its disposal, is the oil.  Especially the oil in the sump.  I am thinking
that painting the sump flat black would help disperse heat from the sump.
I see plusses and minuses with this tho, and would love any advice anyone
has to offer.  As I see it:

Plus:
Better heat radiation from the sump area, lower oil temps.
Paint protects against corrosion and this case has some already.

Minus:
Greater temp differentials between different parts of the case, more 
chance to crack the case.

Does anyone have feelings one way or the other?  have experience?

Other things I am thinking about are:
paint the whole exterior of the case to minimize temp differentials;
paint both the interior and exterior of the sump area;
paint the fins on the heads.
Thoughts on these would also be appreciated.

                           H Steven Dolan
