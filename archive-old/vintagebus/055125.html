Hi Al,
Not quite!  There were at least two versions of this passenger side under
tin
used in 1300, 1500, and 1600.  The one piece that made it more of a pain to
install/adjust the thermostat and the two piece that allowed the rear third
of the tin to be removed to work on the thermostat.  If you used the latter
make sure to used bolts to attach the two pieces together.  Engine tin
screws
which were stock there do not allow enough torque and loosen resulting in
loss of this rear tin piece!   Eric&amp;Barb
