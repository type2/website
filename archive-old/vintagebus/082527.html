Subject: Havasu Planning

Just trying to get some things Ironed out for  Buses By the Bridge 9. Is 
anyone going through Albuquerque and want to carabus? We cruise at a good 
splitty speed (even though I'm driving a bay) and anyone is welcome to join 
us. I'll have more details as the time gets nearer.
Thanks
Mike Hanson
