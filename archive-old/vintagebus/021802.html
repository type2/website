Installed my sunroof last night.  It turned out nice except for one thing. 
It had the pre cut holes on the end for the screws that hold down the end
plate and the cover was a bit short so I had to extend the holes in the
cover a bit to make it close properly.  When i looked at it, the holes were
showing on the back a little, made me a bit upset.  I wish they wouldn't
have cut the holes in the cover for me.  Anyway, hopefully it will stretch
out and then I can readjust it so the holes don't show anymore.  Plus I
didn't purcase the cover, the PO did so I won't feel as stupid if it doesn't
stretch and I decide to get another down the road.

I'll put up pics soon.

Doug
