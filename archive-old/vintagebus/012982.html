&gt; I really need to get a decent set of tires for my bus (a stock '67
kombi...
&gt; Reading archives of this list convinced me these tires contribute a
lot
&gt; to my bus's tendancy to wander all over the highway -- not just
getting
&gt; blown around, it is very unsteady.  It &quot;wallows&quot; and needs constant
&gt; corrections, then corrections to the corrections.

I don't doubt it, particularly with the mismatched tires
front-to-rear!  You might try swapping the front and rear tires to see
if that aids stability a bit until you replace them.

&gt; I've been through all of the suspension:  put in good rebuilt
spindles.
&gt; Steering box, tie rods, alignment, drag link, etc all checked out and
&gt; adjusted as necessary, so there's no excessive play in the steering
&gt; (anymore).  Wheel bearings are OK.  New KYB gas-a-just shocks.  It's
&gt; *much* better than when I got the bus a year ago; now it's less
scary at
&gt; 60MPH than it used to be at 30.
&gt; 
&gt; There hasn't been much said about tires lately, so I wanted to
confirm that
&gt; the tires I have in mind are OK.  Common wisdom seems to be that
reinforced
&gt; sidewalls are key, and adequate load range is also important.
&gt; 
&gt; Both a competent local dealer (Direct Tire in watertown MA) and
&gt; the Tire Rack (www.tirerack_dot_com) recommend the Michelin MX Reinforced,
&gt; which has reinforced sidewalls, in the 185R14 size.  It has a load
&gt; rating of 1540 lbs., which is adequate.
&gt; 
&gt; Tire Rack also mentioned the Continental CR21, which also has
reinforced
&gt; sidewalls.  They said it's equivalent to the Michelin MX except it
doesn't
&gt; wear as long, but it costs less ($45 vs $65).
&gt; 
&gt; Another local dealer recommends a Yokohama light truck tire (he
wouldn't
&gt; give a model number but it sounds like the Y356) that has 8 plys,
and a
&gt; load range D.  Not clear if it has reinforced sidewalls, though, but
it
&gt; was mentioned in the archives as being one of the preferred tires.

An 8 ply tire is stiff and by definition has reinforced sidewalls.

&gt; What is common wisdom about sizes, though?  A wider, e.g. 195, tire
(in 75
&gt; profile to get the same height) would have a wider contact patch --
this
&gt; makes steering lighter, but what does it do for the stability of a Bus
&gt; getting blown around the highway?

Nothing for stability in my experience.  The wider contact patch makes
steering heavier, not lighter.

&gt; All of the dealers have been adamant
&gt; that 185 is the right width for the Bus, but of course a 195 with
lower
&gt; aspect ratio would still have the correct outer diameter.

Nope.  A 195-75 is smaller in rolling radius then a 185.
 
&gt; Who cares if it doesn't fit in the spare tire well, you hang it out
&gt; front anyway, to cover up where the Beastly Boys fans stole your VW
badge.

Actually, it will fit in the spare tire well.  The 195-75 is smaller
in all dimensions except tread width!  I made this discovery when
checking for tire chain clearance.  I keep the pair of 195-75s that I
accidentely bought as &quot;chain wheels&quot; for the winter, since they have
more clearance than the stock tire.

My best advice is to stick with 185R14 load range C or D.  These have
a better rolling radius, load carrying capacity, and look better on a
bus.
If you get 195-75s, you must get load range D.
