Subject: Funny story involving my bus.

Today I had to go on a BIG cabinet delivery.  A local doctor has had a house
built in the rich section of town - the area with 2000 model cars and
bordering a golf course - you get the picture.  I took my bus along and met
the other guys at the job site.  We worked for about 2 hours and 45 minutes
unloading and when we were done, we were faced with a dilemma of getting the
remaining cabinetry downstairs.  The steps were out of the questions but the
space between houses and down around to the backside of the house with the
walk in basement was not only too narrow to drive through but too far to
walk.

Enter my bus.

With cargo doors bungeed open and the middle seat out, I backed down a steep
incline and around to the back of the house - one by one, all seven round
trips to haul the cabinets to the basement.  At the end, we delivered a
champagne cabinet down there.  Wow!  The fun was coming up the hill and kind
of &quot;popping&quot; out between 2 houses. :-)  The guys had a blast but here's the
best part.  On the 2nd to the last cabinet load, the rich and snobbish
well-to-do contractor showed up and was looking things over (as usual) and
as I came out by the garage door, we made eye contact and the look of total
outright repulsion and disgust was so evident on his face I could have died
laughing!  It made the trip well well worth it - I only wish I had camera.
That look was worth a million dollars (as the sign to the subdivision
reads - The Million Dollar Club.)
