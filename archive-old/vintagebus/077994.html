Subject: Re: [VB] Complete wiring harness install on a 67-How hard,
  where from?

.....about $210 and at Busdepot for about the same, is
&gt; there anywhere else out there that has a better price
&gt; on these??
&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; I believe that 99.9% of all the new, aftermarket wiring harness's out there
&gt; are made by a person/company
&gt; called Wire Works or The Wire Works. So the price should be very close with

Wiring Works- Bob Nodvik- ph. 310 519 8147

I paid $165+- for a bus harness from him at an OCTO meet a couple of years
ago.  Installed it in my 63 DC w/ few problems that were mainly self
inflicted.

Tom Buese- 21 degrees out there right now &amp; the wiring works in the DC!
