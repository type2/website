Bill talked about excessively long quotations and the
need to snip.
&gt;Many times I see  replies to a long article that
&gt;quote the whole long
&gt;article.
&gt;only quote the relevant part, 
&gt;this reducing the size
&gt;of the overall post quite a bit.

I agree--I have been thinking of mentioning this
myself and didn't know if there was a policy about
this or not. A brief recap, or quoting only enough so
we know what the reply is all about, is plenty.
