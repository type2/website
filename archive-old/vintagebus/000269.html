Subject: [VB] Considering Selling 68 Square - Whats it worth?
Message-ID: &lt;0.60867c6b.2551d0e6_at_aol_dot_com&gt;

Hi All,

My job situation has recently changed - requiring me to drive more frequently 
- lots more miles.  I am considering selling my '68 Squareback - and getting 
something more comfortable and more reliable.  Any insight on what I may be 
able to get for it if I do sell it?  

Details for the car - and pics - are on our web page listed below.

Any input is greatly appreciated.

Thanks much and have a great day.
