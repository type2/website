    After much procrastination I finally set about repairing the wiring on my 
bus. I was suprised to find most of the original wiring still in tact. The 
PO. had just lengthened it all for some reason. Quality work to. gobs of 
electrical tape and even some cloth wraped wire that seems quite a bit like 
the stuff thats in use in my old crusty house. He also twisted lots of the 
wires together that didnt go together for some reason. strange.
After much cleaning and removal of crap wiring and an unwanted gauge (temp 
gauge that toped out when you turned on the headlight toggle switch) and 
install of a new to me light switch, I was able to get most of the stuff 
working (thanks for the diagram Thom). No turn signals and no brake lights 
still though. I hope that replacing the switch at the master cylinder will 
fix the brake lights but I'm lost on the signals. 
    I'm lucky in that I have a knowledgeable friendly shop right down the 
street who Does repair and sells parts so they where able to provide a 12 
volt flasher relay and tell me which old marking corisponded with which new 
marking, so the instalation was a breeze. but still no signals front or rear. 
The rear bulbs I know are good the fronts I cant get the lense off of due to 
a stuck screw on each one. these are soaking and hopefully will come off 
tomorrow. The switch on the column feels good, Holds well at least. Are there 
bits inside I should clean?  Are the non functional brakes/signals tied 
together somehow?
