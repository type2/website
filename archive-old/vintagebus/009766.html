Here's proof the hubcap is gone:

I just dumped it straight from the camera after cutting the resolution in
half.  We only got one pic 'cuz it was raining :-)  I'm on the right, Ted is
on the left, it traveled a fair piece in that bent Kombi you see there.  I
gave it to Ted from Cincinnati, who gave it to Jamie from Canada, who gave
it Aaron (Stuebenville, OH).  I heard all the above (except for to Ted)
secondhand, maybe somebody can verify it?  So now everyone should be happy,
'twas passed not once but _three_ times!

Everybus was, as Dave Jersey said, very wet.  You can see little rain
splashes in the picture :-)  I had a wonderful time, myself, meeting several
people from the list and elsewhere.  It was organized really well, the
cookout was WONDERFUL (thanks guys!).  No Pop-Tarts for once ;-)  Went to
the Farmington show before coming back, that was awesome as well.  Biggest
swap I've ever seen, and DaveE told me it's usually twice as large!  Scored
several things I needed for the Westy for outstanding prices.  Didn't find
that bottom clamp for the big cabinet though, oh well.  I hope to go again
both to the show and to Everybus.

That's the short, short version.  I'm putting up a webpage with some pics I
snapped and a trip report soon, I'll try to remember to drop a little note
to the list when it's completed.

Sayonara,
