Can anyone clarify this issue as I have forgotton....or uhhh....maybe never
knew.  I know why they did it (pre-doghouse days) but
does this apply to the 009?

Thanks,

I have read some articles in the past that state the lobe for cylinder #3
is
slightly retarded as compared to the other lobes. This was to compensate
for
#3 running a little hotter than the rest and to prevent pre-ignition. I
don't know what specific models are manufactured this way, but I would keep
the drive gear installed properly to avoid the issue. Also don't forget the
little spring under the distributor.

Thanks,
Rick Bowen
