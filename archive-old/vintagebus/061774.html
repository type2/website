Subject: 67 tranny swap...again

Hello list,
I've been searching long and hard for an affordable and reliable tranny-axle for my 67 (1600 dp), and was curious if the stock 67 bug setup with long
axles would fit correctly; that is if I coud use the &quot;long axles&quot; on the bus and bypass the reduction boxes altogether.  I don't have the resources
to check the dimensions, so I thought I'd see if anyone could speak from experience here.
Thanks much for your input, and have a good one.
