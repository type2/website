Yup, I was one of those people saying $25 admission, $70 to swap seems too 
much.  I wouldn't bitch at a buck though.   It does help to have club help.  
But somehow clubs do manage to put on meets changing 5 to ten bucks 
admissionand reasonable swap fees.   Come up to Vintage Meet in Seattle in 
July and check one out.  Ours club does give a t shirt to every volunteer (we 
sign up for the jobs) and has a cartered party (club buys the beer) after the 
meet too, good bribe I think. Probably 30 to 40 people pitch in.  Then again, 
this one has been going on almost 20 years, it is more work to start a new 
meet.

&lt;&lt; (2) There also seems to be a lot of complaining about swap 
 space prices, entrance fees etc. The last swap meet under the WX freeway 
 was free admission! We (SSS) asked for a simple $1 donation to park your 
 vehicle. Sound like a fair if not negligble amount? But you wouldn't 
 believe the amount of grumbling that was heard over this &quot;fee&quot;. The SSS 
 held monthly, then weekly meetings before the meet date to discuss 
 plans. The local Volkswagen &quot;enthusiasts&quot; were invited to attend and 
 lend support. The turnout was less than stellar. Folks these shows/swap 
 meets are hard to produce, promote, and regulate. There is a significant 
 amount of planning, logistics, setup time, and miscellaneous fees to 
 consider. This is true for small meets such as the WX swap, and the 
 picnic at Ancil Hoffman park, to larger venues such as The Classic, and 
 the Bug-O-Rama. This must be considered when forming opinions, let alone 
 voicing them in a public forum. Thank you for your time.
