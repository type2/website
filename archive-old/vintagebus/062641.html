Subject: not charging?

After a week of tinkering and pulling the engine in and out about 5 times.  
My bus is up and running again.  Replaced the bad linkage with an actual 
universal one.  Couldn't get a new throttle cable, but the linkage kit had a 
thing to run the wire into and tighten a screw so it works, kinda like an 
extension.  Only thing that has me baffled is I don't think my 
alternator(yes alternator) is charging the battery.  I have the wiring 
diagram, but this thing is wacky.  OK, the wire with the loop that has 12 
volts when you turn the key on goes to the bolt that sticks out of the top 
of the alternator right?  and this bolt should have at least 13 volts when 
running w/o having the wire hooked to it, right?  This came out of a 73 ghia 
and I didn't grab the regulator before I sold the car, so I have a standard 
bosch regulator that I picked up at the last swap for a buck.  I have not 
installed it yet. Back to the alternator, there are 3 prongs coming out of 
the top to the left of the bolt that sticks up, they are labled, but when in 
the ghia they went to a female plug that snapped right on and to the 
regulator.  I hope I am making sense.  So I get out my multi meter, unhook 
the one wire from the alternator and start the engine, ground the black lead 
and touch all 4 connections while its running and I am not getting anything. 
  Do I have to have a ground on the alternator?  I am befuddled and 
currently searching for a 73 ghia wiring diagram.
