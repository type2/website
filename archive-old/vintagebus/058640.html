Subject: Re: [VB] Has the bus changed my life? (Kinda long)


Has the bus changed my life??
Without a doubt.  I find my bus is a stress reliever. If i'm having a bad 
day, just hop in the bus and go driving around. I love seeing the smiles on 
peoples faces when they see me coming. It's great. They are pretty rare 
where i live. Probably the best thing about my bus is the relationship it 
brings with my dad. He has one too. Vw busses have brought us very close 
together. He has a 71 and i have a 67.  For some reason, everytime we are 
talking on the phone we always get into a vw converstation. Never one of 
those dull conversations where we are just waiting to hang up and get on 
with our life that we use to have. Even though we live far apart, and lead 
very different lives, we have something in common to talk about. Yes i love 
my bus.

&gt;As I was restoring and customising by '63 bus I started using it more and 
&gt;more. The joy of really DRIVING a vehicle as well as the comments and the 
&gt;whole experience of owning the bus became my everyday thing instead of a 
&gt;second vehicle. Then it became my shop truck as I discovered that the bus 
&gt;was much more practical than my other vehicles.
&gt;
&gt;I began working on my suspension to make the steering better and found that 
&gt;the spindle was binding and needed to come apart. To Wolfgang's credit they 
&gt;sent another spindle immediately - no charge ( I didn't even have to send 
&gt;in the bad one first). But while I have the front end apart I haven't been 
&gt;able to use the bus
&gt;
&gt;I own a '90 Mitsubishi Montero, and it has been a very good truck and done 
&gt;all I asked of it, but it developed a computer glitch that, despite $300, 
&gt;has never been right. Also I needed a starter and after trying for 3 hours 
&gt;I couldn't get out more than one bolt and had to have the Mitz towed to the 
&gt;shop. Another $300 for a simple starter replacement. Anyway, I have had to 
&gt;go back to the Montero as a shoptruck for awhile.
&gt;
&gt;What a bummer! 8' lumber fits inside of the bus. I have to tie it to the 
&gt;roof rack of the Montero. The bus is roomy in the cargo area and everything 
&gt;fits so that I can reach in and get stuff. In the Montero tools and 
&gt;materials have to be stacked and I can't ever find anything. I can't even 
&gt;get some of my tools into the Montero. All this even though the back seat 
&gt;has been taken out.
&gt;
&gt;I can't wait to move back into the bus.
&gt;
&gt;My wife has a fancy society car and I have my bus. The Montero, which most 
&gt;people would consider more valuable and realistic than the bus, is a backup 
&gt;and tow vehicle. All this by natural progression. The bus earned and took 
&gt;it's place all by itself.
&gt;
&gt;So, yeah, the bus has changed my life.
&gt;
