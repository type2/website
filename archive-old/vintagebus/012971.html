Subject: Spring stuff, more
Message-Id: &lt;199905191544.LAA03537_at_rotary.type2_dot_com&gt;

More spring stuff . .

How important is it to have your springs all 
balanced for s'rate . . ? 

or balancing the masses of pushrod stuff on the other side.

The spring is on one side of the equation mathematically,
and the mass of all moving components is on the other side . .

That says that the spring rate is the mass, relative to zero.

Shee . . what the hell does that mean ? 

The spring is only there to move the mass back to it's rest
position again . . 

You dump the mass, you don't need a spring . .

Say you have two ounces of mass working against the spring.
The spring is a 500 pounder for this app . . dual or what  . .

Looking back at the equation . . s/rate = mass , if I lose
those tractor parts and dump half that mass . . 1 ounce . .
I can lose 250 pounds off the spring rate . .

Now let's look at this balance thing, all same-same-stuff.

You have a certain amount of buff and if you had to move a 
block of concrete from A to B you can handle it . .

Now you get a block that weighs twice as much . .
You can still handle it but not as fast . . .

We write an equation for that statement: 
cancelling the power as being the same in both cases(you)
we come up with speed is equal to mass . . s = m . . 

Stop briefly here and remember I am not a salesman . . :-)

A quantity of mass will equal a certain speed for your size
butt . .  :-)

You can see these are physical laws . . no batteries required.

Speed . .  (honest we are going somewhere) is defined as
a distance divided by a time . .

Plugging that into the first statement . . distance in both
cases is the same so the equation becomes  &quot;time is equal to
mass&quot; . . t=m . . .

Now we're where I was going I think . . :-)

All that to prove to you that a difference in mass of those
pusher components means that your valves are not opening and
closing at the same time relative to timing . . this sucker
lopes . . .

I could get a job as a bad dream . . :-)

How important . .?  if I lost 250 pounds off the spring rate
by losing an ounce of mass, then time being equal to mass is
equal to spring rate in the realm of what we speak . .

That says it's real important to a racer but relatively
harmless to my daily driver . . 

Although I matched my springs as much . . I didn't even think
about the pushrod stuff . . that's ahh . . dumb . . :-)

Hey any comments or better data . . jump in here . .
I'm not looking to win anything . .
