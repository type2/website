Subject: Re: [VB] bus on the highway

Here in Chile main highway speed limits are 120kph (about 75) with a 
minimum of 80kph. Long haul truckers sometimes fly along in convoys at 
about 130, and the fleets of Brazilian Mercedes busses-although 
supposedly governed to 100 also can be seen doing 130-140 (there's an 
apparent loophole in the speed limit for passing other vehicles: If 
you've got a full and slow right lane, you just turn on your left 
blinker and &quot;pass&quot; everybody).
The law, however, requires a complete yearly vehicle inspection that 
checks everything mechanical including suspension bushings and shocks 
and that also requires a vehicle to have bright enough lights, measured 
with a lightmeter and spectrophotometer to ensure that your colored 
ones aren't faded. Split busses have glass taillights, so no problem 
there, but the PO had to install some horrible looking reverse lights 
and a third brake light in the rear hatch glass. If the bus were 10cm 
taller it would be required to have running lights (little teardrops on 
the roof).
I'm now looking for some later split reverse lights and maybe those 
little baby 50's colored fog lights to increase visibility.
If I put on the old og suction cup full length rack then i'm required 
to have the running lights so maybe i'll put some on there. It's a fine 
line between safety and what The Fabulous Furry Freak Brothers had done 
to their split bus at &quot;Loco-Mota's Garage&quot; during their Mexican 
Adventure (obscure 70's reference). In other words we want to be safe 
and visible, but not gaudy and trashy.

Meanwhile, i try to keep to the older, slower, often prettier roads 
with very little traffic, other than the occasional 2cv citr*en or 
ren*ult dauphine or m*rris minor or 1948 ch*vy pickup loaded with half 
a ton of haybales. Of course there you can also run into or be run into 
by an arrogantly wealthy farmer in his Merc*des SUV or '03 Silverado at 
WOT...

Besides, i've yet to put a tach on the '61 or calculate the wheel 
rotation:crank ratios but it seems this bus is happiest around 60 kph. 
Do i have &quot;mountain&quot; gears? It certainly climbs like a goat and 
requires quick shifting to second...
Not that i've tried pushing much beyond that yet. I still need to check 
rocker gap and change the oil a couple more times first. And change the 
og muffler (from 67) for a brazilian one... before i die of CO 
poisoning.
