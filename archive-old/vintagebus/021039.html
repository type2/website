Subject: Re: [VB] Excuse me/Splittie gun racks?

&gt; Around here just about every truck you see has a gun
&gt; rack in it. Only 
&gt; problem is I don't currently own a gun. 

On this same note, archeaologists I knew years ago
said that the best security they had seen for leaving
vehicles out in the wilds was an EMPTY gun rack.
