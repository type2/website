You're right, you were getting scammed.  Light bulbs are easily
available at tractor supply houses (John Deere, &quot;farm &amp; feed&quot;, that
sort of thing).  So are most other six-volt things, if you're willing
to be a little creative.  Getting new regulators is easy enough,
although they aren't exactly cheap.

If you keep the contacts clean and tight (which means actually doing
some preventive maintenance on them once in a while), a six volt
system is just as good as a twelve volt system.  The latter lets you
get away with more laziness, just like, say, water-cooled engines do,
but doesn't really gain you anything overall.

If you've got the engine apart anyway, put in a crankshaft that's
designed to take a &quot;six volt&quot; flywheel.  The crankshaft end on the
newer engines is slightly different, and it's difficult to get a
non-leaky seal using a new (&quot;twelve volt&quot;) crankshaft and an old
flywheel.  I believe the difference is between using a gasket versus
using an o-ring, and a corresponding difference in the diameter of the
recess in the flywheel.

The six volt buses I've had (and have) have all seemed pretty happy
(modulo when I did something stupid, like misadjust the belt tension
and seize the bearings in the generator).
