Subject: Re: [VB] Child Car Seats and Ventage Bus

&gt; &gt; Are there any other vintage Westy owners that also travel with toddlers
and
&gt; &gt; therefore deal with the car seat issue?  If so, I'd like to hear how you
&gt; &gt; came
&gt; &gt; up with seatbelts or other restraints for the child car seat.

Have you done a visual to verify no mounts exist? My '67 Westy already had
the nut plates from the factory. Just removed the plastic plugs and
installed bay seatbelts.
Sorry if you already said, just got back on the list :)

Jim
