Just as a comparison with what has been related about SOTO.

I expressed an interest in NEATO to Dave E, and within a short 
while, I received not one, but TWO complimentary past issues 
of the Old Bus Review.  This was PRIOR to having sent any 
money.  He got me hooked.

I joined and sent in a couple of ads along with my joining money.
Dave pmailed me asking for confirmation that I still wanted a
want ad included.  He remembered that I sold my '66 Kombi,
so didn't need an ad for that, and I bought a '67 that he didn't
know about, so I didn't need a Wanted ad either.  I really
appreciate the effort to make the OBR accurate and to not
waste my time responding to ads out of date.

I've had thoughts of joining SOTO, but with the great response I 
got from NEATO versus the potential loss of $20 from SOTO, 
there's no competition.

BTW, the Split Bus Guide is great!
