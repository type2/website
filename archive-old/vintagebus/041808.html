&gt; &lt;&lt; One other thing you may want to be sure of.  When you cut new gaskets for 
&gt; an 
&gt;  intake manifold, make sure you cut the large hole in the center, not just 
&gt;  the holes for the bolts around the edge.  Had me stumped for hours.
&gt;   &gt;&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; I don't get it- cut gaskets for a manifold?   where the manifold goes to the 
&gt; head it is a round crush o ring, or for a DP the metal raised squash gasket.  
&gt; to the heat risers I haven't cut gaskets, used the metal sandwich type.  

For the dual port, the gasket kits have the formed metal gaskets,  These
seem to be of marginal sealing effectiveness given the shape of the ports.
I use fairly thick cardboard gaskets in this application.  You can buy
these seperately, but sometimes it's more convenient to cut your own.
