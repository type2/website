Hi Rick,
You need to remove all connections one at a time to check voltage, clean, and 
retighten them.  Pre-1961 wiring systems need to be tightened once a year!  
Go from the battery cables, to the starter up to the fuse box, through the 
head light switch and to the ignition switch, and back to the solinoid on the 
starter.  You probably need to solder all the riveted connections in the fuse 
box and in the headlight switch (Check Type2_dot_com archives for the headlight 
switch article we wrote with Matt Roberds.).  If after all of these repairs 
remove your starter and check for brush and starter bushing wear, and how 
worn down the tip of the starter armature that goes into the starter bushing 
is!
