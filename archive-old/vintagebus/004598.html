Salve, Bus Phreaks!

I was thinking about our nekkid bus, and looking at her... &quot;sorta unique,&quot; I
thought... &quot;mebbe a coat of clear as is, and we'll call it good..&quot;  Michele
did not agree...  To those who missed my earlier post and are curious, this
is the link to some pics of what our '66 Westy (Clara) looks like right now:
http://www.sonic_dot_net/~mizamook/Clara.htm

I spent the part of the day yesterday getting a compressor, a spray gun, and
several products in the preparation to paint genre.  Here's my list:  (I
bore you with it because someone might have suggestions or remarks that
could save my bus...)
    *Gravity HVLP Spray Gun (Brand=&quot;Advantage&quot;/Taiwan) $159.95 + extra 1.7mm
nozzle set ($54.00)
    *Sears Craftsman Two-Stage Oil free compressor (model# 919.167770) + 25'
hose $513.00
        -3.5 hp/20 gal/145-175 psi/4.6 cfm_at_175 psi,4.9_at_100psi/   (hoping
it's going to work...I'll probably try anyway..)
     *A quart of catalyzed surfacing primer
    *A quart of metal prep
    *A gallon of catalyzed primer/sealer
    *A bunch of other stuff like blower nozzle,tack rags,water filters, and
a partridge in a pear tree!

Our plans for the bus color are now L87 Pearl White on top and L360 Sea Blue
on the bottom (even though it's a bug color, it'll still be cool).  As far
as the color matching goes, I hope, since I will be using cheaper paint,
that I can get the magickal Sea Blue that I had on my '66 bug.  That was the
greatest color....it shifted in different light, and always had a really
indefinable quality about it.  If anyone has any suggestions on how to get
matches from photos, please let me know!

I'll be building a spray booth out of 2x4's and plastic sheeting.  I plan to
use two fans to aerate the booth...both intake and output to have filters.
I wonder...should I try to create remote motor systems for the fans to keep
from getting blown up by potential sparks from the motors?

As far as compressor size goes, I think that I can make this one work....I
filled the tank and ran the gun on full blow until the compressor kicked
in...which was quite soon...but I think that the meters were holding pretty
steady ...it was keeping up with the gun.  I probably won't be using that
much air at once anyway...I can't tell until I get some paint in it and try
to get mixture/flow/pattern right.  I figure that I should paint only one
section at a time anyway...roof-front-leftside-back-rightside.  These are
actually relatively small sections, so I should be able to make it work,
right?

Also:  Does anyone have a good technique for removing glass without breaking
it?  I cut out all the old seals, except for the rear hatch.  The seal is
actually in great shape, and it would be a shame to waste $20....unless I
broke the glass trying to get it out!

Thanks for being there,

Gene
