 I'm trying to figger out if my panel is a '59 or a '60.
 
 My chassis # is 533736
 
 One source of Numbers, on which I based the Registry tables, says Nov '59,
 1959 Model year.  The M-tag agrees somewhat with a build date of 11/11/59.
 The Neato Guide isn't much more specific.
 
 I guess what I'm trying to get at, is do I call this a 1960 model or a 1959
 model?  I'm trying really hard to avoid the stigma of owning a 60's bus...
  &gt;&gt;
sorry Thom, we will all point and laugh, if your bus is made Nov 59, it is 
for the 1960 model year.
