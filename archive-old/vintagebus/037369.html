Hi Volks,
Well over a year ago we made copies of these to help spread the information 
and promptly lost them. Just found them again!  It is one large sheet of 
paper folded in half to make four printed pages.  Shows how to:
1.  Set up the bed and convert it back into the seats on either side of the 
table.
2.  Child's cot.
3.  Erection (Thier use of wording not our's!) of large and small tents.
4.  Chemical toilet
5.  Placement in the engine compartment of fuse holder for the Westie 
interior light/s.

So if you are interested in one or two of the twenty copies we made.  It is 
$2.00 for one copy and $3.00 for two copies, both prices includes postage in 
the USA.  
  If you did us a favor in the past and are interested in a copy/ies, please 
remind us (The mind is a terrible thing.)!  Either way it is a first come 
first served till they are gone.  After that, if there is enough 
interest.....     Eric&amp;Barb
