Subject: Rear hatch...oops
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

I have been saying that I need a rear hatch, but what I need is the decklid, 
the part that covers the motor. I don't really mind not having it, because 
the motor was just rebuilt and repainted, but I need a place for the license 
plate, and isn't it required to light up the plate? Anyway, are these hard to 
find? Expensive? Do you think I can find one at Pomona? And by the way, I'll 
be there again on the 16th of April. Hope to see some of you, even if I don't 
know who you are.
