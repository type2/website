You are lucky that they don't call you MeetWindowPete!!
I could see how that could happen but something would have to break or be
put in there wrong.  You are lucky though that you finished the trip without
any more problems

&gt; Hi List,
&gt; Last week we took my daughter on a spring break road
&gt; trip up in the mountains of NW Arkansas. We were
&gt; driving along on a back country road, only doing about
&gt; 20MPH when I heard a loud &quot;Clunk-de-de-clank&quot; and the
&gt; left rear wheel locked completely up on my 63 crew
&gt; cab.
&gt; I couldn't seem to find the problem, so I called a
&gt; frind of mine and he came and got us with a trailer
&gt; and took us to his place. We jacked up the truck and
&gt; removed the wheel and found that the brake shoes had
&gt; come loose and had lodged themselves inside the drum
&gt; in such a way that the wheel could not turn. I might
&gt; mention that I'm running a 69 or 70 beetle IRS rear
&gt; end.We didn't have the parts to fix the problem, so we
&gt; took out all the shoes, springs, etc. and blocked of
&gt; the brake lines to that wheel and ever-so-gingerly
&gt; went on our spring break tour. I was just wondering if
&gt; this has ever happened to anyone else?
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; 3DPete
&gt; Buck - 63 crewcab
