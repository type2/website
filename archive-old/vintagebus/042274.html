&gt; I wonder about using old grease.  Isn't it
&gt; contaminated, and that's why you're replacing it?

With the price of new grease, it hardly makes sense to keep old grease
around.

&gt; But, does anyone know any reason NOT to use antisieze
&gt; on the brake adjusters?  I just had my rear brakes
&gt; apart, and decided to try antisieze instead of grease.

That's what it is made for!  Stops things from seizing!
