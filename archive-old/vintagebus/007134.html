&gt; Now to the point. What size are the bolts supposed to be?. I suspect that
&gt; holes (nuts welded on the underside)   are just cruddy from years of
&gt; non-use. I could clean them with a tap but I dont want to bugger them up
by
&gt; guessing at the wrong size.

They are NOT metric!
They are SAE.
7/16&quot; fine thread.
