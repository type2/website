&lt;&lt; is this due to misalignment or overtorquing? If overtorquing, what's the
 right torque? &gt;&gt;
Hi Wilder,
No, not due to overtorquing for us.  We went by the specifications of 72-87 
Ft Lbs., and there is a tightening pattern also.  Center, forward, top, 
bottom!  The stock bolts are just too short for both the material, and wieght 
it has to hold as is.  Plus with the use over the years, and any rust that 
has gotten into the threads just weakens them.  Interestingly the bolts to 
install the front end to the body are about double the length where they 
thread into the body threaded holes, and those do not have the added twist of 
the spring plates!   Eric&amp;Barb
