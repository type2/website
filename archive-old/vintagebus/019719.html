I've found that the VW-specific shops charge a lot more than 
&quot;normal&quot; shops.   I think Lavere's is in the the $60+ range as well.
I know a local guy who had some work done by one of the more famous
SoCal guys, and it ran $5k to get one corner replaced, one section of
frame, some belly pan work, and some misc little spots.  My '54 deluxe at
that rate would have cost somewhere along the lines of the GNP of Peru.
Sure, it would have looked nice, but I could never have afforded to get
it out of hock!

&gt; What does metwiz charge? I thought is was less than that...
