I just finished a rag top rebuild on the 23 window FOR SALE

I have done several with home-made hardwood blocks, this time iI used the
WCM rebuild kit. It is the nicest product they make.  I think it sells for
around $55ish
I have them if you need them.

It saved lots of time playing with homemade ones.  GOOD KIT

Remember if you are doing this at home, put in good webbing straps, they do
not come with any kit. I use nylon ones 2&quot; wide.  They are what pull to
mechanism forward, parallel.

Merry Christmas
