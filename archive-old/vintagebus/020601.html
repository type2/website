Thanks Gary for the advice.  I guess this must be the first time I've had
the drum off for any length of time since Gretchen got a new freeway
flyer.  Just once for new shoes.  Geez... the things your mind cooks up
when you're about to drive a ways.  


&lt;&lt;It will probably stop leaking when the new drum is tightened down,
Still, these axle seals are very fickle so you might replace the seal.
Of course, that one may leak, too.  I have a '56 beetle and vw planned
on the axle seals leaking on this car.  There is a system designed for
the oil leaking past the seal to drain out away from the brake shoes!
Crazy but it works....   Gary Gibson&gt;&gt;


Thanks,

Adam
