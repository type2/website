&lt;&lt; let me know if this looks like a switch off a set of
 early 60's (judging by the screw terminals) ambulance fans.. &gt;&gt;
Hi Michael,
No it is not.  It probably is an add on switch for pre-WWII autos to install 
later signals.  We have an interesting collection of German printed auto 
mechanic magazines that show this in an article and our info is from what we 
can figure from the pictures.  Anyone know if there are really good German to 
English translation software out there yet?   Eric&amp;Barb
