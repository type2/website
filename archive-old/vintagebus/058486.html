Subject:  [VB] Insulating the DC

Here's an update on my attempts at killing some sound in the DC.  =
Earlier I had found some pics...

This was on a singlecab at Jerome last year. They claim that the =
singlecab is so quiet that they cannot hear the engine running.

The stuff they used was from JC Whitney, I found it at Home Depot =
disguised as a water heater jacket.  Its the same thing, comes with the =
tape and no shipping...if anyone is interested.

I read the article in the archives about insulating but just wasn't up =
for that much effort and permanent goop on my truck, so I'm trying this =
out.  I've got it started, it goes pretty quickly, I'll let the list =
know what I think.
