Subject: cutoff selenoid

Was out tinkering with the 62 DC tonight.  New battery, checking
electrical, installing the carb that had been removed when the PO
stopped driving it 7 years ago.

I pulled off the cutoff solenoid and hooked it up to 12V.  It would not
retract with out a nudge.  I lubed it with some penetrating oil, to no
effect.  Is it trashed, or is this normal functioning?  This is from a
German 34 PICT 3.

Thanks.

Steve
