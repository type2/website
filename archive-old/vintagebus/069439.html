&gt;Is that the same Beto from this list. 

Rob,

No pachuco o Pacheco aqui.  Mi nombre es una fruta.  One note to remember is that 'Beto' is like the most common nickname for Messkins...

&gt; The Beto that I
&gt; have met doesn't look anything like the clean shaven fellow that has his
&gt; picture in the mag. 

I'm trying to figure out if I should be offended by this comment =)

&gt; Kind of looks like him but without the bandanna or facial
&gt; hair.  Is that the same Beto?

The last time I wore a bandanna--hmmm.. must of been with my parachute pants and fat neon shoelaces...grade school

Judging by your description...I should be a hairy sumbitch with a bandanna...I think you met my wife =)
