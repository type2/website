I couldn't agree more.  However if you read the pst carefully I said use 1/4&quot;
ID rubber line, which sidesteps the &quot;stock line issue&quot;.  I've been running
exactly this configuration for a few years now with the best possible results
- NO FUEL LEAKS and minimal rubber fuel line ;-)

I'd rather be poor and unknown.  If I were rich the gummint
would take the rest of my money.  If I was famous, everybody'd
be digging in my business.  You don't even know my dog's name.
