&gt;  I joined this site about a week or 2 ago.  I have already posted a
&gt;  couple of questions here, and got some great responses back from some
&gt;  very caring and giving individuals.  People have gone out of their way
&gt;  to help with my bus questions.
&gt;  
&gt;  But unfortunately, it seems that most of the posts/talk on this site is
&gt;  about truck drivers, whether you like or dislike hippies, and 5 word
&gt;  contests.  Is that really what this site was intended for?

speeking as someone who has often gabbed much in response to people's tech 
queries, I say for myself, that as much as I am still posting, I have
1, been busy, 
2 sometimes just don't want to think, and
 3 sometimes feel that the same things come up and people theoretically can 
check the archives, which for myself I have never figured how to do.  

one of the projects I have been working on is replacing the passnger side 
panel from the corner seam to just behind the reinforcement  in front of the 
vents, down to including the wheel well.  The 66 13 window was hit there at 
some point after having the wheel well cut.   The rest of the bus is quite 
straight and rust free- a quarter size rust hole in the front floor on the 
right hand side is it for rust holes.  Straightening the pushed in areas was 
interesting, but worked out well. Involved heat, a come-a-long, and the 
basketball basket pole in the front yard, among things. Exploring body work 
is interesting, but takes a lot of time.  Today the replacement panel was 
tacked on, fitting took ages.  what a PITA.  I think it'll be great.  :)
