Subject: 63 crewcab question

Hi List,
 I saw the stuff about VIN's, chassis #'s, codes and
all that and it awakened a lingering question that
I've had for awhile. I'll tell the story to get to the
quest. When I purchased my '63 Crewcab, someone had
cut out the partition behind the front seat. It is my
understanding that this is where one would find the
M-Codes and all the secret codes to the life of ones
prized possessions. My truck has the chassis # stamped
in the engine compartment and there is also a metal
tag in the engine room with what appears to be vehicle
weights and the same chassis # that is stamped into
the compartment floor. The question, since &quot;the wall&quot;
was cut out and the M-Code plate along with it, can I
ever know the true bloodline of my crewcab or will it
always be a mystery like me???

Thanks and Happy Holidays!

Pete
'63 Crewcab - Buck
