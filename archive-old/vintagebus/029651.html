&gt;One none of my 50's buses ('54, '55, '56) did the parking lights stay on
whilst the headlights gloweth.
&gt;
Uh-oh, now you made me go look at the wiring diagrams on your site (plug).
 Looking at the 54-55 Barndoor and other pre-60 non-USA diagrams shows that
the taillights and parking lights are on the same fuse so if the taillights
get power, the front parking lights do as well.

Looking at the 57-61 USA diagrams, the front parking lights are powered
by the headlight switch - I don't know how the switch internals function,
but since the bullets don't appear to light up with the parking lights,
I suspect the parking lights are on when the headlights are on.

I'm assuming everything is wired correctly and all switch internals are
functioning as designed.

Feel free to correct me.
