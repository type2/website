Subject: Paint - Mango Green / Seagull Grey

So I looked around and made some calls to find the Mango Green paint I =
need.  The guys who sell the BASF stuff said they had a formula for =
mango green in their R M line.  I went to get it and it was that dark =
putrid green that I've seen on late 50's buses.  I think I saw it on a =
57 once.  I figure that the guy who entered the formula in thier data =
base screwed up.  Anyway - another place I called said they could make =
mango-green in their ValuPro line.  I asked for a sample and whoa - =
perfect.  It's a hair darker then a would expect but then - my reference =
point is 40 years old so - it could easily be a bit lighter than what it =
was.=20

My question - So whats the scoop on Valu-Pro?  I have some CIL acrylic =
enamel primer surfacer that I plan on using.  I had that around for a =
while but I don't have the reducer for it.  Should my valu-pro reducer =
work for that CIL stuff as well - both are acrylic enamel. The valu-pro =
paint is ICI or PPG?  This stuff is Acrylic Enamel and I hear that is a =
very good choice for someone who has never painted before. =20
