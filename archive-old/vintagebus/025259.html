When lurkers talk they really babble.

I have always stopped a little short of a complete fill 'cause the heat
&gt;from the motor seems to cause enough expansion in the fuel to make it
leak out the filler spout. The 20-30 mile rule sound like a good one.

I work for an educational service unit in Omaha Nebraska teaching
teachers how to effectively use technology in their classroom. My
specialty is visualization tools like Virtual Reality. Check out

Yesterday was my birthday and my birthday gift was a Franklin Mint 1962
Microbus. Way cool 8)
