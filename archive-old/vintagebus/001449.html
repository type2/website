ok, so I dont know what the hell I'm talkin about. I'm sure you'll forgive
me.
Found the link for the movie trailer and it's actually a late 60s DELUXE
with one of the taillights burnt out. :)
Some girls escape from a mental institution and the bus is their escape
vehicle.
Come on, its been months since I saw the preview. Blame it on my mind.  It
fabricated what it WANTED to see :)
