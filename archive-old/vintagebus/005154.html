&gt;It probably isn't the new bearing that's at fault. If you needed to
&gt; replace one bearing, then the rest of them are probably worn out too.

I am not replacing the bearing because it is 'worn out'. I am replacing it
because the cage that keeps the rollers evenly spaced is/was plastic and it
ceased to exist. Very cheap design.

&gt; The play you feel is probably in the lower inner bearing.

When I can move the stub axle up and down and the rollers move an eight of
an inch inside the outer race, the bearing is CRAP.

&gt; I recommend
&gt; that you take the whole RGB apart and replace all the bearings. It's
&gt; really kind of pointless to replace just one bearing in a RGB. Any chips
&gt; that are in the oil from the other worn out bearings will quickly ruin
&gt; your new bearing.

I don't have any chips because I don't have metal failure from the old
bearing. Even though the plastic cage was gone, the old bearing had NO play.
I found the bad cage only because I had to swap the backing plates.

&gt; I've used Bower brand bearings before and didn't find them to be any
&gt; different from any other brand. Different companies will have different
&gt; part numbering systems. Some companies will just use the same system as
&gt; one of the big guys like FAG or SKF. The difference in part numbers
&gt; probably doesn't mean anything. They both have 207 in them, so they're
&gt; probably the same size.
&gt;
&gt; When you take the Bower bearing back out, compare it to the used bearing
&gt; you're putting back in. If it has the same ID, OD, and width, then you
&gt; can be sure you need to completely rebuild the RGB.

The problem is NOT in the ID, OD, or width. The problem is in the clearance
between the rollers and the outer race.

Let me make this clear:
The outer race is very tight in the housing.
The inner race is very tight on the stub axle.
The rollers are permanently attached around the inner race.
When you put the inner race/roller assembly inside the outer race, you CAN
move it back and forth almost an eight of an inch. This is with the bearing
laying on a flat surface and you are moving the inner race back and forth.
With the brake drum on, you can rock the drum a 1/4 of an inch at the edge!
