	There is a difference in the Bosch blue (Brazil) Bosch Blue (Mexico)
Bosch silver (replaced the blue Brazil) and the Bosch black of which there
are 3 different ones (type1-2) with different voltage outputs and
resistence. 

Somewhere in my disaster area office I have the specs on all the coils and
will make a point of looking for them and posting all the specs on the list,
you'll be surprised.

     The weird thing is, unless you have a good supplier who knows the
difference, 3 of them have the same part numbers and you won't/don't know
which one you'll get!

The coil should be the same.  Or close enough it will not matter.  Shoot I
think I could swap coils off the Porsche and it would work on a VW.

This is very rare to have a blown coil.  BTW there is no difference between
the Blue coil and the regular black ones.

The fried wires lead me to believe that you may have an electrical short in
the + coil wire somewhere.  When you hooked up the new coil the wire hit a
ground somewhere and started to toast itself.

Solution is to run new wires.  This should be easy since there are only two
wires coming in from this loom.  One black one for the + coil wire and a
green one for the oil pressure idiot light.  Also visually check the choke
wires and check them for ohms resistance.

Sounds like you have a '66 just like mine!
