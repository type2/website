&gt; though I think yous who think WOT is the same as recommended max/cruising

I believe I'm the one who said that;&gt;) Please excuse the
lecture.

The question at the start of all this was could an engine be
overheating because it was pushed to high in the RPM range
while cruising. 

The gearing of the splitty is such that at around 3600 RPMs,
you get around 60 MPH as the top end with a stock tranny and
tire setup. That just happens to be the point on the HP
curve where the engine is at its maximum efficiency. It's
also the most your going to get with the stock intake and
carb.

The splitty took around 36 HP to do this. Kind'a neet how
that works out. It takes &quot;X&quot; amount of fuel, and air, to
produce 36 HP. If you restrict the air opening to the
engine, you restrict the power output. The size of the carb
and air runners is engineered to feed enough air and fuel to
do 36HP, and no more. The VW splitty is engineered to run at
WOT in fourth gear without damage. 

The above applys to 4th gear only. In lower gears, where
there is less load on the engine, you can supply enough
air/fuel mix to run the engine faster then recommended
(5,000 RPM). That is why they put the regulator in. People
would put 'em in low gear, put their foot in it and over rev
the engine.

I'm sure others will disagree. This is what works for me.
