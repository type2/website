Subject: Re: [VB] undercoating ?

No No No? I dont think were on the same page. According to what i read, he has *no* undercoating,
just has lots of surface rust everywhere.  If you pressure wash with soapy water which removes loose
rust and any dirt and grime/oil, then por it, it should work great. And being that the manufacturer
of the product also recommends this procedure, why not? Por likes rust and/or rough surfaces that
are clean from dirt and oil. The purpose of the marine clean prep stuff is to clean oil/dirt and
basically leave a rougher surface if its smooth shiny metal (which Por hates.) Pressure washing with
soap and water is achieving virtually the same thing in the end since the metal is already roughed
up from the surface rust.

Unless i completely and totally misunderstood what kevin is asking and saying, and if that is the
case, my apologies.

&gt; undercoating a bit, before applying POR.
