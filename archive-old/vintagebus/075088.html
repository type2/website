Subject: RE: [VB] 1961 Double Cab... 7-23-03

So tommarrow I'm gonna get the fuse box mounted back up. How exactly 
DOES the fuse box mount up? Does it just pop in or is there supposed 
to be some kind of holder to keep it in place?


  I have used a 4 or 5 mm bolt with a wide washer and nut to hold in a
couple of my fuse blocks. Works great, just don't over tighten and crack the
block
