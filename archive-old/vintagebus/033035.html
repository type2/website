Subject: '67 Double Door Panel for sale
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com


The finances of my &quot;new&quot; bus purchase force the sale of one of my others - 
only so much room in the driveway and even less in the bank account.

On to the details:  1967 Double Door Panel, mostly straight with a few dings 
and patched rockers on both sides, they both need to be redone to look good 
but otherwise the bus pretty darn solid.  Two of the panel doors have had 
camper windows cut into them other two are uncut.  Comes with three standard 
windowed cargo doors.  Use these to make it a passenger bus or pull out your 
welder and turn them into panel doors.  Has original cab divider.  Engine 
runs but is weak - no knocking noises - I suspect a cracked head or valve 
problems.  Trans and reduction boxes are good.  Has both bumpers, emblem, 
uncut wheel wells, etc.  Bus is just outside of Kansas City Missouri   $1400

Email me for more information
(I'll be out of town from Tuesday till Thursday noon)

Thanks,
Dan
