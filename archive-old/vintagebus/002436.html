   I over heard my wife tell her friend on the phone that she 
didn't mind all my vws, ( 6 bugs, 1 bus), plus me spending
every available moment working on them.  She said at least
she knew where I was and that I &quot;didn't smoke, drink or hang
out in bars chasing women&quot;! 
  You mean if I sold off my vws I could...eh....?
  Lou in Havasu
  Too many to sell, oh well, just a Friday thought! 
P.S. maybe just the bugs!!!!!!!!
