&lt;&lt; All is well, for
 now, of course.  I'm stoked on a Sunday night I replaced the clutch in 3
 hours.  Thanks for the help, all.  I could use the search engine thanks
 to whatever problem about denied access that's plaguing it, so you all
 came through.  I love this list! &gt;&gt;

Years ago and it was Bulli eve and my brother had bad clutch too, so we took 
the clutch off my 40 horse that I had at my shop and we pulled his motor just 
far enough (not past the bumper) and had it back in with a new (used) disc 
and pressure plate in I think under an hour. He did go and buy a real set up 
that weekend, but the important thing was getting his bus to the shows.
