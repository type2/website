I agree: a good chunk of the value of these speciality
cars is having all of the pieces that make it such.

For instance, I have a 1955 westfalia.  But is it
really a westfalia?  Doesn't have much, if any, of the
real westfalia stuff, so in cold brutal honesty it's
a 1955 kombi with a hatch on top.  I've even considered
welding up the hatch and making it into a kombi if
I can't find any of the westy stuff.
