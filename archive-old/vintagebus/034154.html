I don't think they have had the bikini contest for a couple of years, last
time it was a showgirly type of thing, Drag racing, well that will only be
the weirdo's in drag running from each other, but look for the bare metal
double cab, there's always a good show going on over at that bus, if I can
remember his web site you'll have to check it out for some pre Classic
warm-up. But at least they line all the real vintage stuff up front so you
can easily avoid the water pumpers, of course unless Bob-o-rama decides to
put from newer to older up front. Now Thom. come down Friday for the pre
classic camp-out and mega caravan to the OCTO show, ever been in a 50 bus
plus busavan?

ronnie, it'll be here before you know it

ps. john won't do the classic swap so he'll have money for Thom's gas 1 way
(he he)

Grrrrreat.  Now it's going to be a bikini/NewBeetle/CalLooker/Drag Racing
event.

Suffice it to say that the two individual's interests in &quot;vintage&quot; VW's
would appear to be diametrically opposed.

Maybe it will become an American hotrod show...

For those of you who are fortunate enuf not to hail from the Sacramento
area, this is the same guy that owns &quot;Bugformance&quot; and puts on the
Sacramento Bug-O-Rama.
