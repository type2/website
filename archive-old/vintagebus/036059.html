&gt; And I'm glad the SC got sold - let's hope it's to a good,
&gt;  loving home. 

I think that SC went to the ABC (Az Bus Club) for their 1999 9th annual Jerome
Jamboree.  If it's even half what they did with the camper this year it will
be one beautiful singlecab up for raffle next year.

I'm saving all my change as of today to try my best to win it.  Of course we'd
have to run for cover if we won another jerome bus, but I'm willing to chance
it.

1995 Jerome raffle bus winners and the only (not counting this year's bus)
known winners to still have their $0.50 bus.  Hopefully it'll be at the 9th
Jerome
