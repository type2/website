Subject: Wolfsburg Letters.. free vs 10DM

I have obtained both of these documents.  I got the free one via the net 
about a year and a half ago and it was all bad info.  It said I had a 57 when 
my van is a 64.  The one I paid 10DM for was all correct and also told me the 
serial # of my original engine.  That was the only info it gave me that I 
could not get from the VIN and M code tags.  I guess you get what you pay 
for...
