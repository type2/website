&gt; I got in after doing _another_ set of rear wheel bearings
&gt; I would expect to get more than 24000 (twenty four thousand)
&gt; miles from a set of wheel bearings.  It was not a
&gt; lack of grease that caused this bearing to fail.  It was, plain
&gt; and simple, poor quality parts.  Ths same parts he refers to in
&gt; his 'buy quality parts' post of today.


For every rule of thumb, there are always exceptions.

Buying name-brand parts is not a guarantee that they will outlast no-name
parts, but it certainly increases your odds. The wheel bearing kits I have
sold for the last year or so are, for the most part, from Febi, who is an
original equipment supplier. (When I can't get them I try to substitute like
quality such as SKF or FAG where possible.)  This is not to say that all of
the bearings are neccessarily made by Febi; like other name brands they
often have some parts made for them. It's a global market and subcontracting
is a fact of live. (In fact I have even seen the aforementioned Timken
brand, which incidentally is a decent bearing, in the Febi kits from time to
time.)  But generally if a reputable brand like Febi is willing to plaster
their name all over the kit, you are reasonably safe that the quality will
be there, as they are a well respected company and have a reputation to
uphold.  They are not going to source a product based solely on price
without considering quality, given that if the product fails it is their
well-established brand name that will be take the hit.

Was your experience unusual?  I think so. A catastrophic failure like the
one you describe is almost always caused by heat/friction, such as a hot
spot caused by lack of grease.  For it to occur under other circumstances is
certainly not impossible, but it is very rare.  Would you have been better
off buying a Chinese bearing of unknown origin because it came with a
&quot;lifetime warranty&quot;?  In your specific case, perhaps, since in retrospect
the chances of your particular bearing failing were 100 percent (albeit
after 24k miles).  But as a general rule, I think not. I still say that as a
rule of thumb, your odds are much better when you buy reputable name-brand
parts, a point which I think few would refute.

Incidentally, this still does not invalidate the point of my original post;
that a lifetime warranty often is of little real value. In fact, your
experience reinforces my point.  Say you had purchased (for the same price)
the cheap Chinese bearing with the lifetime warranty, and it failed the same
way.  Nothing would have been different. You'd still have had to redo the
job and replace the drum. The only difference is that if you paid shipping
both ways (which would have equaled the value of the part) they'd have sent
you another Chinese bearing in exchange. So you probably wouldn't have
bothered, lifetime warranty or not.

So it all comes down to, the question of which part would have been more
likely to fail - a cheap one with a &quot;lifetime warranty&quot; or an OEM one with a
factory warranty?  I still insist that, on average, the OEM brand one would
be less likely to fail than the no-name one, your atypical experience
notwithstanding.
