hello list,

This is the Matt, and Wednesday, I passed a splittie bus on rt 22 on the way 
to school, which is a rarity, (and I also lost another hub cap).  went to 
wal-mart, no luck.  I am looking for someone who sells chrome roll bars for 
street legal dune buggies.  I am also looking for an original set (of four 
or five) hubcaps (large VW emblem) for my 67 beetle.  One more think, the 
pokemon intro to the cartoon goes &quot;gotta catch em all! gotta catch em all! 
Pokemon!&quot;  Well: Gotta drive em all! Gotta drive em all! Volkswagen!
see ya,

Matt
67, 77, 75 beetle,
66 bus,
75 off road buggy
65 legal buggy
81 D. rabbit
