It comes on the right from the right, and from the left from the left, 
meaning both sides.  Seeing as the heat riser is a tube, when you clean it, 
it should be clean all the way through the tube.     The ones that have been 
run on engines with headers that have them blocked off are usually cleaner.

 &gt;&gt; On the subject of cleaning intake manifold heat risers - do you often

 &gt;
 &gt;Which side does the exhaust come in? (I forget)
 
 I'm not sure what you mean here.  I thought it came in on both sides.
 I have a heat riser on either side of the carb pedestal, and each one
 goes down to a small flange near the rear cylinder exhaust port on
 the heads.  These flanges bolt to mating flanges on the intake side
 of the muffler.  I thought each heat riser was a closed-off tube -
 just a &quot;dead end&quot; for some hot exhaust to hang out in.
