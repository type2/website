  Exemption  for Collectible Vehicles Signed Into Law by Governor

So is this one of those very limited use claused laws? You can do this but the vehicle has to be registered and insured as a collector vehicle limited to shows and parades and not more than 300 miles a year? 

Just curious... 

Chris

My thoughts exactly; are they giving a wink and a nod to the daily driver or did they fly under the radar (if so, good for them!)?
