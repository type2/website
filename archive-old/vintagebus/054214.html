Subject: Re: [T2] Where do they go? (Vac lines)

&gt; As previously stated, I am going to replace the 009 Dizzy on my 66 ('71
&gt; 1600 DP engine) with a stock vacuum dizzy.  I have a 34pict3 carb. So
&gt; there's 2 vac lines on the stock dizzy, one closer to the rear of the
&gt; engine ponting down, and 1 closer to the front of the engine pointing
&gt; toward the dizzy body.  And there are 2 vac line on the carb (1 on the
&gt; left side of the carb, and 1 on the rear of the carb).  AND there's also
&gt; 1 vac line on the intake manifold) I'm no math genius, but I can see
&gt; that with 2 vac ports on the dizzy, and 3 on the carb\intake that there will
&gt; be one too many (or few) lines.  So exactly how do these lines connect?

from the library:

to wit:  you'll probably want to plug the port on your intake manifold,
although you could probably use that port interchangibly with the
port that is on the Rear (Rear Is Rear) of your carb.  Both of these
ports should be roughly equivalent, although if the vacuum port
on your intake manifold is off to one side of the manifold, the vacuum
there will vary somewhat based on which cylinder is firing.

anywho, read David Schwarze's writeup on engine vacuum, it's required
reading when trying to learn all this stuff:

good luck!
