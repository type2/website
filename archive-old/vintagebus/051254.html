Subject: RE: [VB] Re.Fuel petcock

yes indeed! rachel and i went for a cruise today and while on the freeway,
the bus started to sputter and we both yelped with glee and i pulled the
knob and almost instantaneously the bus resumed on its merry way. 
such excitement!!
can't wait for the next time!

&gt; i really want to go drive around now and &quot;run out&quot; of
&gt; gas, just so i can operate the petcock in a &quot;real
&gt; life&quot; situation.

&gt; I did the same think when I fixed the Petcock on my 59
&gt; Single Cab. When my 59 finally ran out of gas, it was
&gt; very sudden with No Warning at all. Luckily, I was on
&gt; a country road going 45mph so the speed kept the
&gt; engine going long enough to allow the reserve gas to
&gt; get to the engine. Sure was fun...
&gt; There is something so antique feeling about the fuel
&gt; reserve system.
