This fall I was looking around in a &quot;Big Lots&quot; store
in a nearby city, and found some paint that looked
close to &quot;Pearl White&quot;.  Bought a can to try it (39
cents for a 8 ounce can I think), and it matched close
enough to use for fixing scratches, etc., until I can
get the double cab repainted, or get some proper paint
mixed.  I don't remember the exact color, but it was
for a Datsun/Nissan, I think, and for a 1980's or
newer car. Of course, they were all out of it when I
went back to buy more a week later.
I can look at the can tonight if I can find it in the
garage.
