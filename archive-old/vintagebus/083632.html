Subject: Re: [VB] re:overheating

sounds like you changed where the air was sucked in through, which is not  
stopping a vacuum
 
I found very little difference in engine bay pressure under tests... as in  
not more than 1mmHg between idle and 4K rpms.

rust me  guys, the KEY to cooling the VW engine is reducing engine bay
vacuum.  Bastart motor combo's will run hot no matter what, but even perfect
motors  will run hot if EBV is not accounted for.
