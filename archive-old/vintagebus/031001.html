got one of those - OK but, only gives you the bad news. I have replaced it  with
a jam thermometer! (20UKP)

Needed to put the sensor into a bit of brass tube to make a dipstick, extended
the probe lead to get through to the cockpit, intend to power it from the
ignition switch. (Tested it in ice water &amp; steam.)

Wot a result! Instant feedback - (did you know that your oil temp shoots up when
you lift off the throttle?)

Just a thought.......

Simon.
