Subject: RE: [VB] early English TRANSPORTER MANUAL reprint
To: soundex_at_eden_dot_com

&gt;&gt;&quot;TRANSPORTER WORKSHOP MANUAL, 1955-1967 Reprint of
early 
English
&gt;publication&quot;

&gt;I have an 'original' of one of these... my copy is
NOT a 
bad xerox; it came
in a red and gray cover, reading:
&quot;Type II Transporter series 1200-1600 shop Manual&quot; The

quality is as good
as the Bentley reprint of the splitty manual. The
bitch is 
that it has NO
publisher, NO ISBN, NO address or identifying mark AT
&gt;ALL.

++++++++++++++

I have a similar manual, published by &quot;Autobooks&quot;, I
think--at least my recollection of it is similar to
what is being discussed.  Seems to me that I have seen
a reprint of it available someplace that did
acknowledge the original publisher, etc.  
If this is the book, it is useful--sort of like an
early version of a Haynes manual.
I would still recommend getting the Bentley manual,
too, but I think that there have been a couple of
times that this English book has helped me when I
couldn't find the information I needed in the Bentley.
