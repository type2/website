&gt; &gt; My passenger's side 2/3rds seat for my non-walkthrough, was there a couple

&gt; &gt; screws that hold down the back part?? I remember someone telling me that
&gt; &gt; you
&gt; &gt; didn't need any hardware to mount the front seats, but I see two holes that
&gt; &gt; look like bolts should be in them, but then again maybe somebody added this
&gt; &gt; on later??
