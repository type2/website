Subject: 58-61 tailights,

Hi all,

I was cruzing through e-bay today, and noticed that different people are
labeling two different items with the same label.  Yes, i know to expect
that, but what I was wondering, is with regard to the 58-61 tailights,
why do some have screw terminals and other have slip on terminals.  I
have a '59 and the fuse box is all screw terminals, so why would there
be slip ons for the same set of years.

Thanks,
Aaron
