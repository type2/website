   I thought of that. I was told that there had to be some modification of
the mounting bracket or something under the dash to make a 67 fit. I don't
see anything that looks like it's been tampered with. I guess I should just
pull it out and look.
  I will check out the other diagram though.

thanks,

Rick

&gt;Sounds ilke you have a 12-volt, dual-speed motor ('67-only, I
&gt;believe).  Seems like it'd have been easier/cheaper to get a simple
&gt;on-off-on switch and go with all four wires (since your bus has been
&gt;converted to 12 volts), rather than the on-off-half/on switch that's
&gt;in there.
&gt;
&gt;Try grabbing a '67 diagram to get the connections for the motor.
