&lt;&lt; Should one heat up the transmission before changing the oil, You know
 drive it for a couple of miles? &gt;&gt;
Hi Meredith,
Well it is more of driving it till all the crud in there should be stirred up 
which happens to warm up the oil and tranny case due the friction of the 
gears and stirring of the oil itself.  A good 30 minutes on a regularly 
driven tranny.  On an unknown or new or just rebuilt tranny make sure to 
change it again at 1,000 miles and then every 20,000 miles thereafter.
