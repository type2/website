Subject: Re: [VB] Sealing Westy Windows? 

To the point for once...

The stuff is referred to as &quot;putty tape&quot;. Yes is basically window sash
putty/glazing putty that is preformed into .75&quot; x .125&quot; (2.5 x 20 mm) roll
separated from its self by a crepe paper liner.

Possibly available at hardware stores but I obtained it from a local &quot;RV&quot;
supplier. In this application I would think that modern clear silicone would
work fine (if not better) and will be hidden from view. I have also used this
around the edge of the front ceiling fresh air access panel mounting surface.

Clarification: I am referring to the surfaces where the main (outer) frame of
the Jalousie window and the retaining (inner) frame of the Jalousie window make
contact to the preformed window holes in a Kombi body.

Prior to installation install an outer &quot;dust seal&quot; (grey rubber) around each 
Jalousie window main (outer) frame. Check with Ronnie (Old Volks)in Havasu, AZ
for nice reproductions of this previously IMPOSSIBLE to find item. This outer
dust seal is NOT the main deterant for keeping the elements on the outside of
the bus but is more of a aesthetic finishing touch and secondary measure to
keep the big stuff out.

Additional note: Step up and spend the extra pennies and obtain stainless steel
replacements for the screws that hold the windows together. Contact your local
yellow pages &quot;fastener&quot; supplier. Local Phoenix contact is Copperstate Nut and
Bolt. They can match most anything you need at better than Home Depot prices. A
good Ace Hardware store will carry common items in stainless. Use stainless to
hold fresh air panel and front door window half sections onto the lower door.
Stainless will look great years after you forget what you paid for it...

Good luck.
