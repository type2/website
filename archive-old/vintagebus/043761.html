&gt;My '59 Kombi has trouble going into second. [...]
&gt;An old VW guy told me I more than likely just need to adjust the 
&gt;shifter up in the cab. [...]
&gt;Has anyone done this?

My Dad and I did it on his '74 Bug and it helped quite a bit.
Basically, loosen the two bolts, take the gearshift out, clean
it up, grease the ball on the end of the gearshift and the socket
it goes into, reassemble, and adjust (see below):

&gt;The Bentley basically says to adjust it until it shifts into all 
&gt;the gears correctly. But wouldn't you have to drive it after every
&gt;little adjustment to see if you got it right?

That's exactly what you have to do.  You might make some marks
with a felt-tip or something on the plate and the floor before you
remove anything, so when you put it back together, you know where
you started.  Take a guess as to which direction will help, move
it, tighten the bolts.  Then take the wrench that fits the bolts
with you and start driving.  If that direction helped, try a little
further in that direction, but if not, try the other way.  When
you're happy tighten it down good.  If you have a mechanically-
inclined friend who can ride along and adjust the plate for you,
it goes faster, but you can do it by yourself no problem.
