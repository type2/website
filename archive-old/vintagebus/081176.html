Hi Veewee,

Last I checked last year, the bowden was adjusted well, but that will be
an item to check when I get under there - when this weather finishes up
and gets warmer and drier.


&gt;   Also would be interesting to know if this problem happened to start when/if
&gt; you had changed any clutch with new parts or differant type of clutch
&gt; components.

No, the problems seems to have been around for a while, and I can't recall
any major changes which began it. I'm running a sprung disc. The plate is
the fingers type without center ring, as the TO bearing is the type that
slides on the sleave and has the ring thing.

The clunk occurs when the engine speed is not exactly matched to the
tranny, and it happens before the clutch is released or occasionally right
when the clutch is released. There are no symptoms of fulcrum plate
problems and no loose spring plate bolts. Rear mounts look normal, as does
front, which is only 3 years old, and not Indian or chinese.
