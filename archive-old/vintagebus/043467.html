Subject: Muffler too wide?
Message-ID: &lt;Pine.LNX.4.10.10011190532240.26944-100000_at_birdbird&gt;

Hello all!

Well, I finally got my heater boxes on.  Went to slide the muffler on
and no dice.  Engine is a 1500 from a '68 bug (by engine number).
Muffler is an Ernst, German.  It looks very much like the one in Bentley,
except the pipe comes out of the muffler on the right side.  The tail
pipe is much longer than the Bentley one, so it can cross back over and
exit on the left side.

I can fit it on one set of head studs and it misses the other set by
about 3 mm - the muffler flange is too far outboard.  I can look through 
the head stud holes in the flange that won't go and see a little over
half the OD of the stud.  I have tried various strategies of attemping
to bend/move the flanges just a little closer, but I haven't had any
luck yet.  I even tried cussing at it in German with no results.  :)
The Ernst stickers on the muffler say that it should fit 1500 and 1600
engines.

I'll probably be able to make it work tomorrow, but I just wanted to
do a quick sanity check - maybe somebody has seen this before and knows
that I have the wrong muffler?  Or maybe whoever built this engine
really torqued the hell out of the head studs and compressed the
cylinders some, making the exhaust ports on the heads closer to the
center of the engine.  :)

Thanks!
