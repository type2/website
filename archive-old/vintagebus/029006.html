&gt; Hello....the best way is  if you know someone in the US Army.
&gt;
&gt; Shipping to  someone in the army in Germany is the same cost as shipping to
&gt; someone in the USA.
&gt;
&gt; Shipping by the Post is the cheapest, but surface post takes 4-6 weeks
&gt;
&gt; Also if you know a company that ships cars / parts in a shipping container
&gt; they can send your heavy parts pretty cheap.
&gt;
&gt; What year bus do you have ?  I did not see many old buses in Berlin when
&gt; I was there.........Chris

Hello,

thanks for all the informations that reached me up to now.
I hope that i will be able to ship the parts to germany.
Wish me luck.

Tschuess Oliver

P.S. Hopefully there will be a website about my ´60 Panel and the restoration
with the parts from oversea.
