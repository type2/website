No.  Early bus wiper motors are mounted on a small plate only slight larger 
than the motor itself, and are connected to the separate wiper shafts using 
thin rods and ball joints.  Later busses use an integrated frame made out of
stamped steel, which included the wiper shafts and linkage all in one unit. 

I don't recall for sure when the change was made, but I'd speculate that it 
was one of many that were inaugurated in mid-1963.  My '61 Microbus uses the 
separate linkage, while my '65 Deluxe uses the larger frame with everything
built in to the unit.

the first frame kind came in the 65 model year- none of the bay windows came
with the frameless set up.   I like the frameless set up as it is easier to
find parts,  and install them or replace/grease pivots.   Finding and changing
pivots on the frame kind is more work for lazy me.  And for some reason they
seem to break more on the frame kind.
