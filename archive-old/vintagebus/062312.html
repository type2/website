Subject: RE: [VB] middle seat seatbelts

we grew up with a 63 bus and then a 65 bus until my dad got an American van
in 1969. In both cases he extended the seatbelts with hand bent steel
straps. The center portions of my SC seat belts are also extended with 8&quot;
steel 1/8&quot; steel straps attached to the original mounting points in the
wheel well. My wife and I needed the, um, extra room. heh heh

&gt; Hey everybody...
&gt; I have a 67 deluxe, which has the floor mounts for
&gt; seatbelts for the middle seat.
&gt; My question is: they look like they are a little ways
&gt; back behind the seat, so I'm worried that if I mount
&gt; seatbelts in there, people getting into the back seat
&gt; might trip on them. Plus, I'd have to cut slits in the
&gt; rubber floormat.
&gt;
&gt; Anyone have these mounted? Is tripping a problem?
&gt; Or, has anyone mounted seatbelts (customly) to the
&gt; framework of the middles seat? Like, to the rear leg
&gt; of the seat?
&gt; That way you could turn the middle seat around
&gt; backwards (conference style) and people could still
&gt; use the belts.

I have mine mounted to the floor and there is no tripping problem.

It would be nice to have the belts attached to the seat.  My father's
C*evy van has belts bolted to the middle seat, but the seat supports
themselves are MUCH beefier on the Chevy.  You need two people to carry
the Chevy seat.  I don't think I would want to trust the seat supports of
the VW to carry crash loads.
