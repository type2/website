This issue is only indirectly related to buses/Vanagons, but I think is
relavent since so many of you order your VW parts (and probably other
things) via the internet.

I received a call yesterday from a customer, saying that his browser
indicated that our secure order page was not secure; that our Verisign
secure certificate had expired.

That is not the case.  It is a Y2K issue with certain older versions of the
Netscape and Explorer web browsers.

Essentially, anyone using a secure server, with Netscape 4.07 and earlier
versions (or 4.05 and earlier depending on what report you believe) will get
a message saying that the site's secure server certificate had expired. Your
browser thinks that all secure servers Verisign certificates expired on
12/31/99.  Microsoft Internet Explorer 4.5 for MAC (but not Windows) may
exhibit the same problem. Not sure about derivative browsers such as AOL.
This issue has been well reported in the press, as well as at the Verisign
website, http://www.verisign_dot_com/server/cus/rootcert/faq.html .

The only known fix is to upgrade to a newer version of the browser, which is
available free from the Netscape and Microsoft websites.  If you do not
upgrade your browser, your order to the Bus Depot will still be secure,
because that is a function of my site, not your browser.  But since your
browser will think that no site is secure, you will never know when you are
on a site that really is not secure.
