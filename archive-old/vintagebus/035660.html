talking about dumb things we have done to our vws...

when I got my bug the oil sender leaked.   i over tightened the new one and 
broke it off.  removed it with an easy out (the metal is pretty soft), which 
I had go to get, which meant driving ten miles on windy back roads to town to 
the Napa store.   overtightened the next one too and broke it off as well.  
at least the removal tools were handy this time.  The next time i did not 
overtighten it :).   Irealised that it is not holding the rear axle nut on, 
you see.   I wouldn't worry about cracking the case, the sender is softer 
metal.   but you really dont want to break it off.     it has i think they 
are called pipe threads, the slightly tapered ones. so some threads end up 
showing.     Some later vws do have ones with straight threads than take a 
crush washers.   The water cooled vanagons have two like that.

try getting Robert a torque wrench for his birthday?

 &gt; The type 2 senders I have seen have a cone shaped area above 
 &gt; the threads.  
 &gt; Instead of a crush washer the body of the sender seals 
 &gt; against the engine 
 &gt; case.  Do not overtighten because there is a casting line on 
 &gt; the boss and 
 &gt; they have been known to be weak areas and crack slightly and &gt; leak.
 
 I would be more concerned about trashing the theads in the case myself. I
 have always got senders that when installed oiltight have 4 or 5 milimetres
 of thread showing between the boss and the case. 
 
 Seems to me that this is always going to be an invitation to people like my
 thick wristed friend Robert, who snaps off studs and breaks bolts when they
 have any thread still showing, to wind these things in too tight.
