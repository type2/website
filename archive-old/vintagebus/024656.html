Subject: Josh R(OK)

Waaaaaa! :(
(Nothing else seems to fit my feelings)

I got to 'talk' to Josh a number of times while on my camper-bus search.
I would send him m-codes &amp; descriptions and he'd send me answers to
questions and hints on how to determine one conversion from another.
I sent him photos which he thought would be helpful for others and
through it all he was so very kind.  
I still have his e-mail in my VW-box for reference and it saddens me
just thinking about reading it... his good-nature was apparent
throughout.  The funniest thing I remember about Josh was his sig: &quot;Josh
R(OK)&quot;. I always read it as &quot;Josh okay&quot;.. and to me he certainly was.

My heart goes out to his family and friends. 

Carabussin' in thought and prayer, 
Melissa Reynen(CA)
