Dave -

 The only &quot;scanned&quot; pic I have is on the web. Go to
vintagebus_dot_com/ gallery and search &quot;Sean Dorman&quot;.
There is a pic of my spice rack before the panels were
redone.

&gt;      Any pictures of the Rack?  I've got a junk one
&gt; to use for a
&gt; pattern.  I've got a Kombi I'm putting back as a
&gt; Camper and plan on
&gt; using a Oak Paneling to make a Custom Camper kit
&gt; based on the Westy
&gt; (using a Junk Westy interior for pattern again). 
&gt; Any way, I plan on
&gt; making a Spice Rack from Oak in the same design has
&gt; the original.  Would
&gt; just like to see some pictures of a good original.

&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; I recently redid the spice rack in my westfalia and
&gt; was curious about something. I just saw one sell for
&gt; $160.00 on ebay! Too much for me so I remade the
&gt; four
&gt; thin panels on my rack that were damaged. I seems to
&gt; me that these panels are the biggest problems on
&gt; these
&gt; racks because they are always broken. I made mine
&gt; about 1/16 thicker so it is stronger. I cut some
&gt; extra
&gt; and was wondering if there was any interest in them.
&gt; They are made from the original material and are cut
&gt; so that the grain pattern faces the correct way
&gt; (Hello
&gt; type A personality!)and they have not had the holes
&gt; drilled to mount them or the finish sanding done.
&gt; That
&gt; will give you the option to take them down to
&gt; factory thickness, if you
&gt; so desire. I haven't thought of a price yet but it
&gt; is a little labor
&gt; intensive to take them down to the desired
&gt; thickness. I should have a
&gt; set or two at BYOB if anyone wants to take a look. I
&gt; am also working out
&gt; the kinks on a door mounted stove that looks like it
&gt; could have been a
&gt; Westfalia item. It is only slightly larger than the
&gt; spice rack (width)
&gt; and requires no additional holes to be drilled to
&gt; mount it. It uses the
&gt; original style mounts that are on the spice rack.
