Subject: positive thoughts

yesterday while driving home in stop and go traffic, i reassessed the relationship between my commuter 1967 beetle and me.  i wondered how i'd feel if my '67 got smacked.  it is a beetle after all and a kind of late one at that.  well i decided that i'd be pissed.  about 15 or 20 minutes later while sitting behind a stopped car, squealing brakes and a crunching sound, my beetle had a smashed rear passenger's fender.  the lesson i've learned?  think positive thoughts; my thinking about an accident caused one.
