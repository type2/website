Subject: Pressed Bumper available

I got this off of a Bus in VA.  I would like to trade it for something instead
of selling it.  I'm going to offer it here and Fullmoon list first.  I won't
ship it, but will be at EB on Sat, North vs South on Sun and Naturalbus in
June.

Some things I'm looking for my Splitwindow: Deluxe clock that works, slanted
end rear bumper, Westy stool Helphos spot light.  I also collect Bus toys and
I'm open to just about any trade.  My no means do I think this bumper is
necessarily worth some I my want items.  I'll ad cash or what ever for the
right trade.
