Subject: Reduction Box Bearing

Hey, my friend who is a non-listee has a major problem that somebody may be
able to help with. He came over the other day and said he had funny noises
coming from his driver side reduction box. When we took it apart the whole
lower outer bearing (the one under the cap with the seal) completely fell
apart. It's a '67 hardtop d'lux. Does anybody have a spare used bearing
they'd like to get rid of super cheap? He doesn't have a lot of money around
christmas, so he can't afford the $49.00 RMM wants. I have parts that I'll
trade if anybody has one. If you need something let me know and we can cut a
deal. Thanks.
