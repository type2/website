&gt; I couldn't agree more.  However if you read the pst carefully I said use 1/4&quot;
&gt; ID rubber line, which sidesteps the &quot;stock line issue&quot;.  I've been running
&gt; exactly this configuration for a few years now with the best possible results
&gt; - NO FUEL LEAKS and minimal rubber fuel line ;-)

How did you adapt the 1/4 inch line to the carb and fuel pump?  I had to
use 1/4 line once in a pinch, and I found that I really had to crank down
on the hose with the hose clamps to get it to seal.  This is hard on the
hose.
