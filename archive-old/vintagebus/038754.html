Drove my bus to work today for the first time since I tore it down to
re-paint. Time for the Big Shakedown to work out the bugs before our trek to
OCTO/Classic. ( about 1860 miles one way ) Anybody else driving from the
midwest this year?  Wave if you see me by the side of the road!

Anyway, I put the original trans back in after having it rebuilt and adding
a 4.12 R&amp;P. The RGB's I rebuilt a couple of years ago. Problem is it has a
nice howl that peaks at 45 mph and dies away around 60. I can hear it
through all gears, not just fourth and it moans in neutral as well at high
speeds. Fluids are at the right level and the nuts are torqued properly.
Could it be because of tight rebuild tolerances or a shoddy rebuild? I know
what you're thinking, just drive it at 60, right!? :)

Happy Friday,
Everett Rein
