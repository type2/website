I'm almost positive my pedestal has the back mounts on the INSIDE...

seat mounted with 2 wing nut's on the back and 2 on
the floor.  The back one were OUTSIDE of the lower
base.  I beleave VW changed the base and went to the
rear mounts on the inside somewhere around 61 and then
again changed the base is 64 for the new rear seat
style.  To my knowlege, there are 3 different rear
seat bases so make sure you have the right one.
