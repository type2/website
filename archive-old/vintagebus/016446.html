Subject: New photos on Thom's Gallery...
To: buslist &lt;vintagebus_at_lenti.type2_dot_com&gt;

I posted four photos within the Gallery area of Thom's
website at http://www.vintagebus_dot_com/.

A.&gt;
Two photos in the Stand by your van section.
-Mercedes 319-D stash that I located in about 1996(?)
I whiffed on it because we were still in the middle of
doing the RFH, just moved, just finished my Masters
degree and where in the heck was I supposed to store 2
elephants?! =) Looks like I'm smuggling a spare tire
under the T-shirt.
-Pic of Paula and I and the Resto from Hell when all
three of us were a touch fresher.
B.&gt;
Barndoor section
-pic of the '54 Barnambulator on the dock at Port
Hueneme, July, 1998. Fresh in from Denmark. Parked in
front of a cool Alpha Romeo bus. I was expecting an
old wooden pier with Marlon Brando yelling
&quot;Stelllllaaa!&quot; Instead the Port looked more like a
Ralph's parking lot.
C.&gt;
Other section
-Front end shot of the Alpha bus.
