&gt; Hi Daniel,
&gt; The M-code plate was installed in 1961 and later buses on the front side of
&gt; the bulkhead behind the passenger seat on bench seat buses.  On walkthroughs
&gt; they are on the right side of the overhead air intake vent.  On the SO-34 &amp;
&gt; SO-35 Westies built from 1961-65(?) the plate is under the passenger end of
&gt; the flip bench seat bottom.  So you might have to look a couple of times to
&gt; make sure you plate is not in other places, or better yet take the front
&gt; interior out and clean thoroughly.  This should turn up the M-code plate
&gt; location one way or another.  Eric &amp; Barb
????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????


When we are talking passenger side are we talking LHS or RHS ?
Being in AUS my bus is RHD.
The front interior is stripped bare except for the steering wheel and
handbrake - still no M-plate
Thanks.  Daniel
