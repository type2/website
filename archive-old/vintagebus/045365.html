Hi all--

Well, I finally came upon a pretty clean Splitty in Vermont of all places 
(rest assured--this bus hasn't lived on the east coast for long). I'm not 
picking the bus up until the 20th, so I don't have the M codes yet. VIN is 
236159293. Pictures of the bus are at 
http://albums.photopoint_dot_com/j/AlbumIndex?u=970883&amp;a=9359036

She's a Sundial conversion, at least that's what the little metal plate says. 
Anybody know what's supposed to be inside? This one just has a bed and closet 
to hang clothes. And wow, what a shade of paneling. Do I *have* to keep ot 
stock? :~) BTW, instead of a headliner there is the same paneling up top. Is 
this the way Sundial's came or is this someone's elaboration on the theme?

Oh--one last thing--anybody know where I can get a rear view mirror. I'm 
driving her next Friday and would like a mirror in place! (Bracket is there, 
it's the mirror glass that's gone.)

I'm thrilled with this bus. I'll be posting more as I start exploring and 
tinkering.

Sue
