Subject: Re: [T2] POR-15 questions

 From my experience  I think the marine clean is optional but the metal
ready is not. You also don't have to use the top coat over the por-15 but it
will discolor in the sun if you don't.  Just get  all of the paint and as
much of the rust off as you can, it can only bond as well as what its bonded
too. I didn't do a good job of this in my single cab and patches of the por
15 chiped off and rust started again about a year later. I striped the
places I treated on my 15 window down to bare metal before using por-15 and
it looked great 2 years later. I did use marine clean where I had used
chemical strippers to remove the paint.

Subject: [T2] POR-15 questions


&gt; Hi all - I've been hearing and reading a lot about this stuff called
POR-15,
&gt; and would like to get the list members' opinions on it.  Any good or bad
&gt; comments would be welcome, I just want honest ones.  A concern for me is
the
&gt; cost.  According to the POR-15 website, you should use four steps to
prepare
&gt; and finish the surface:  (1) Marine Clean, (2) Metal Ready, (3) POR-15,
and
&gt; (4) Chassiscoat Black.  The website lists prices for a gallon of each as:
&gt; $28.75, $28.75, $95.00, and $140.00.  Is it worth the expense?  Do you
HAVE
&gt; to use all four chemicals?  How much coverage will you get with a
&gt; pint/quart/gallon?  Reviews of POR-15 I've seen are positive, but that's a
&gt; lot of money for me on top of the other parts and repairs I'm getting.
&gt; Thanks for your advice!
&gt;
