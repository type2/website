A filter sump is a special plate that replaces the sump plate and contains
a filter.  this is not a good idea because it puts the filter on the
suction side of the pump which can cause big problems if you get an air
leak in the pickup system.

&gt; Do you have any literature you could scan?  I'm curious if this is a better 
&gt; way to go to get filtration than using special oil pump covers, drilling 
&gt; and/or plugging holes in the block, etc.
