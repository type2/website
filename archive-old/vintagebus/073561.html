If you have modified your 9-prong box as per the &quot;matt roberts&quot; method then you
should just be able to replace your flasher unit for an electronic one, then
your bulbs will flash at a normal rate.  I have just been playing with my turn
signals and brake lights on my '67 because I recently purchased a european
trailer which has amber turn signals and my bus does not.  I ended up running a
harness back from my relay box behind the drivers kick panel using my front turn
signal outputs and brake switch as well.  I have just finished and if it wasn't
1:30 in the morning I would be yelling jubulant battle cries as I have now have
a complete bus/camper rig with perfect signal lights.  It has come a long way in
the last two days.  Now once I get the solar panels installed this baby is going
camping.

ive used them... they are nice as they can be seen in DIRECT sunlight, where
the 1156 bulbs are almost useless in bright sun. but, i didnt like the fact
that they made the lights blink so fast, like when a bulb is burnt out. i
could never be sure that all the lights were flashing... and i didnt feel
like MacGyver-ing some relay to slow them down to normal speed :-)
