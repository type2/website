Subject: Free - german breadloaf book
Message-ID: &lt;0.705d4ac0.2532c683_at_aol_dot_com&gt;

I have a book left over from when I use to drive breadloafs.  It is in german 
(auf Deutsch)

Title: So wird's gemacht (which I believe translates to &quot;How it works&quot;) VW 
Bus 1,61/50 PS
Author:  Hans-Rudiger Etzold (with a umlat on that last &quot;u&quot;)
Published: 1979 by Delius, Klasing &amp; Co (in Bielefeld?)
Pages: 170

It is just taking up room here, so if any one can USE it, p-mail me and I 
will mail it to you.  Just let me know on want model and year breadloaf you 
will be using it.  After you get it, you can send me some money for the 
postage if you want to.  If not, that is cool also.  I guess as long as it 
does not cost more than a few bucks, I will send it to Germany.  Hey, there 
is nothing too special about it, sort of like a Clymers in german.  Looks 
like the same sort of pictures that would be in Bently.  Sorry digest 
readers, first response gets it.

Sorry to post this to the split list, I no longer subsribe to the loaf list 
since the divorce.  AnyONE on the loaf list care to pass this on?
