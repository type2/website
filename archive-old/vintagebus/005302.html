The rear seat from any bay will bolt in ok, wont look perfect. will be a bit
tight at the sides if I remember from when I had one in my 65....

The middle from the 69 will work if you are creative... it will not fit
exactly. The later one will be worse still..

P-mail Ty_hodges_at_hp_dot_com, former frustrated listmember, he is the seat year
guru, has had every incorrect seat in every year split you can imagine, some
of which I sold him...:)

&gt; There is a 64 Kombi in the area for sale sans the middle and rear seat. I
&gt; have two nice sets  of early bay seats. One set if from the 69 and the
other
&gt; from the 72. Will these bolt up to the existing holes (ones made by VW not
&gt; by nature) in the cargo floor? Will the rear seat even fit in it or is the
&gt; splitty slightly narrower than a bay?
