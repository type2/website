  I'm trying to get the front seats out of my '67 deluxe( haven't got an
owner's manual yet) so's I can try some alternatives.  Got the back
rests and passenger seat out easily, but can't figure out the trick of
the driver's seat.  Can someone please tell me how?  I looked all around
and under the seat, practically stood on my head trying to figure out
how to remove it myself!  NO LUCK!
Thanks and have a nice day.

for the drivers seat as you sit in it reach tyour right hand down under the
front of the seat and find a little lever that hopefully has the litle white
knob on it.  Pull up (i think) and scooch you rear forward and hopefully the
seat will go forward too (how to adjust the seat forward and back), then get
out and reaching across hold the lever up and push the seat forward.
Sometimes the seat is rusted to the rails and wants to stay put, a friend to
hold the lever or to push (whack) the seat forward helps.    

Grease use du jour:  clean your rails with a wire brush if there is rust, wipe
off old grease and use new grease on  the rails on the bus and the bottom of
the seat and the moving parts for the lever before reinstallation.
