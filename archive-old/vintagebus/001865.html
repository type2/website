Steve,
Go to http://www.w-p-c_dot_com/buggythrottleplatehole.htm.  The site is called
Ken's Buggy Barn.  He has some extensive information at this site.
Describes distributors as well as carburetors and the mixing of each.  I
read through and tried several applications and it soolved my stumble or
flat spot on my 67DC.  Try it you'll like it.

Eric &amp; Barb,
I am going to try to find some FV guys to see if anything is available for a
jet gauge.  I will also go down and get some jets from the motorcycle guys.
I did notice that the Bocar main jet and the solex main jet look different,
at least the head is, I did not check to see if the thread size was
different.  I aloso found out in my racing days that  after checking solex
jets that they were not always as marked.
