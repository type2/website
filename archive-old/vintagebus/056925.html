&gt; Bum ground on right trailer tail-light.  Check the left one too,

Hmm - I think I have the bulbs oriented correctly, because the correct
filament lights up.

&gt; &gt;I tapped into the harness where it comes up by the right taillight.

No, I'm using the term 'tap' liberally: I stripped away 1/2&quot; of insulation, 
attached the new wire, soldered it, and taped it back up.
  
&gt; &gt;I'm using the gray/red gray/black for the running lights, and the 
&gt; &gt;black/red black/white for the blinkies and brake lights.
&gt; 
&gt; And you ran a ground wire from the trailer frame to the Bus body, 
&gt; right?  Thinking &quot;Oh, it'll ground through the hitch ball&quot; is the
&gt; number 1 cause of dim, crappy trailer lighting.  Running the ground
&gt; wire through the connector is fine, but make sure there is one.

Yes, I did.
