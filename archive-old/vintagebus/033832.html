Subject: Side step...rear gate...safaris
Message-ID: &lt;5233f727.24bbd1f5_at_aol_dot_com&gt;

Looking for original side step for my 67 kombi and also rear gate for 59 
single cab. Willing to pay any reasonable price plus shipping.

Plus I have a question, Who really does make the best repro safaris? I was 
told that Izz's Safaris does. Is this true? What's so special about them?
