&lt;&lt; Can you make a version of that for a Volkswagen bus? &gt;&gt;
We come across old Allstate swamp coolers that were sold in the late 1950 
thru the 1970s 12 volt and sit on the floor of the auto you choose to install 
them in.  Just unplug the cigarette lighter plug and lift out to install in 
the next rig!
