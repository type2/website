&lt;&lt; My transmission started making a very loud clanking noise in all gears. It 
still drives well, no power loss but sounds like its banging on the floor. 
Tranny case full of oil. Slips out of fourth gear but this is a very old 
problem. I know that it needs replacement due to fourth gear but would like 
to save it as long as i can to save up cash for new tranny. This bus is a 
daily driver so i need to use it all the time. &gt;&gt;
Hi Jim,
Does the loud clanking noise happen all the time while driving or only when 
you really give it the gas or start out in the bottom of each gear?
