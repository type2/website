Subject: Re: [VB] 6 Volts times 2 = 12v?

Hi Jay,

This is what I am planning on doing in my bus.  I currently work for a Heavy 
Truck Transmission manufacture and one of our transmissions run on 24Volts.  
Since the US market is 12 Volts, we have a voltage doubler to raise the 
voltage to 24 volts.  In looking at this doubler it works from 6V to 12V.   
So it should work for the bus to give me 12V power to the electronics that 
need it, but will still be able to leave the bus at 6V.   The company that 
makes this &quot;heavy duty&quot; doubler is Sure Power Industries.  I know they have 
a website and you may want to check that out for further info.

Hope this helps,
Mike

Howdy all,
I have been searching the archives learning all I can about the 6 volt vs. 
12
volt quagmire. Is it possible or desirable for my 63' camper to have two six
volt batteries wired up in such a manner to: A) provide a coach battery for
ancillary 6-volt components and B) provide combined 12-volt current for a
stereo or other accessories?

Would I need a split-charge system to avoid the equalization effect of two
batteries hooked up together (parrallel or series I don't understand the
difference)? I don't know of any 6-volt split-charge systems currently
available. I talked to Hellroaring Technologies,  (
http://www.hellroaring_dot_com/ ) and they may come out with one in the near
future but do not offer anything now except a relay. I was thinking of
physically locating the main starting battery in the engine compartment 
where
it belongs and the second auxillary battery under the bench seat area.

Another possibility is using a dedicated 12-volt battery for the auxillary
needs, charging it up every night with a battery charger/tender and leaving
the 6-volt battery currently in use for starting &amp; coach power needs.

Ideally though, I would like to have a setup similar to the way many
motorhomes are equiped. In the systems I have seen, there is a selector
switch (within driver reach) to utilize either one of two seperate 
batteries,
or both, and also when plugged in to shore power both batteries charge
simultaneously. Some even have a 12-volt to 110vAC inverter on-board to
provide temporary 110v AC power. It looks as if shore power was once an
option for my bus as the dinette lamp is 110v AC and there is a female jack
installed in the rear bumber (disconnected however). Is any of this possible
or feasible in a 63' bus that is currently all 6 volt? What is the best way
to go?

Thanks,
Jay Cronen
