Subject: Re: [VB] insurance work &amp; hobbyist's responsibility (longish)

&gt;c) would the repair shop do very little of the work (straightening, 
&gt;painting - most or all parts supplied by owner, most or all 
&gt;reassembly done by owner)

most of the body shops here are strictly bang-it-through insurance 
work... sheet metal (or plastic) and bondo, then a quick spritz of 
paint.
as long as it LOOKS good, they don't care and figure you don't 
either. i had a neighborhood shop do a jackpoint  and crossbeam for 
me a few years back (lack of welding skills on my part) and they shot 
the unfinished joints full of 2 or 3 cans of body compound and 
painted it black. 'man that's factory spec!!' he claimed.

take the insurance money, buy a welder and a spray gun. you CAN'T do any worse.
