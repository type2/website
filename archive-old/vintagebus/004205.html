&gt;I'd like to hear the entertaining responses you give to these questions!
&gt;
&gt;&gt; Here are some recent quotes from non-VW people at work about my '55
Kombi,
&gt;&gt; &quot;36 hp?  Don't you need at least 100 hp just to move it?&quot;
&gt;&gt;
I explained to him about gearing.  Weird thing was, he was babbling on about
a Fiat X/19 he used to own, which I do not believe has 100 hp, either.

&gt;&gt; &quot;No one would steal it - it's a VW Bus!&quot;
&gt;&gt;
I explained the popularity of the VW Bus and commented that a normal thief
probably couldn't even figure out how to start the Bus (starter button, set
the choke, reverse my theft measures, etc.).

&gt;&gt; &quot;Is this a 21-window?&quot;
&gt;&gt;
I expounded upon the method of counting windows, the difference between 21
and 23 and that they should note the location of any Deluxe Buses they see
and immediately contact me.

&gt;&gt; &quot;I can't believe you drive this thing.  Why don't you get a normal car?&quot;
&gt;&gt;
I explained the difference between driving a car and riding in style, how I
feel no stress from traffic, the fact that my Bus is going up in value, and
how the equivalent of their car payments will give me a factory-fresh Bus
within a few years when they're ready to trade-in.  Weird thing is, once
this person had a ride in it, they liked it.

&gt;&gt; &quot;Isn't it dangerous to drive it on the highway?&quot;
&gt;&gt;
Only because of other driver's negligence.

Bye,
Everett Barnes
'55 Kombi
