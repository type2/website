Subject: Re: Heater Tube

i had to get a tube for my '66 as it didnt even have one when i got it. i 
went to an electrical supply store and bought a 8' piece of galvanized pipe. 
(maybe conduit) it was the perfect diameter, maybe an 1/4&quot; larger than 
needed, but made it easy to cut and slip over the ends. it was maybe $8!!!

i wrapped it with that adhesive foil pipe wrap and it works like a charm.
