Since it's Friday, I thought I would post something.
Check out the VW Bus Bean Bag Toss Board that I made for the kids to play
with at our clubs Car Show this weekend in Lafayette, LA (Shameless Plug,
heh).
http://www.thebugbox_dot_com/toss.htm

As of last week, we had 40 rooms booked for our show this weekend, and
that's not counting our club, and the 12+ that we have committed from the
other clubs that are near us.

If you are interested in coming to the car show please check out information
at the following site:

Thanks
Charles
