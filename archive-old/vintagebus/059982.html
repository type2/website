Subject: Re: [VB] More Electrical Mysteries

It sounds like you are not getting voltage to the connector on the right rear that lights the turn
signal and brake light filament (same filament).

Take the bulb out on both sides and get a friend to step on the brakes. On the left side, check
which terminal on the bulb holder lights up. Go to the right side and see if you have voltage on the
same terminal.

If you get no voltage, you either have a short in the wire going to that side or the bulb holder is
defective. If you get voltage, you have a bad bulb or the connection between the bulb and bulb
holder is bad.

On your license plate light, you could be losing ground at the hinges when you close the lid but,
the light should pop on again when the lid closes and latches to the body. Is this happening? If
not, the wire going to the license plate light might be losing continuity.

1) When I step on the brake with tail lights on, the right side stays lit as
a tail light--does not get brighter like the left side does. With the tail
lights off, the right brake works okay.

2) Still no turn signal at right rear. Right front blinks fast fast fast. I
checked the directional switch with a test light and that is working fine.
Checked the flasher relay (3 prong) and it is working fine. Cleaned all
contacts. Checked bulb. What should I do next? I have not hooked up all my
wires to the speedo yet--does the one for the signal need to be hooked up for
the right rear to work?

3) Hooked up license plate light. Works fine with engine lid in &quot;up&quot;
position. The minute I start lowering the engine lid it goes out and stays
out. Connections are clean and tight at the fixture, and the ground is good.
