Mike,

Yeah, I owned one of the &quot;Medi-cars&quot;. Mine was a 1972 Beetle. I think
that was the first year for it, but I am not too sure. In theory, I
suppose it was a great idea. But the computer broke down a lot of the
time (some things about computers never seem to change!!), and the
computer was so basic it might just as well have run off of punch cards.

The bug was a great car, though (although it had too much plastic crap).

Les
