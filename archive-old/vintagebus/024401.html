If you do decide that you are up for the challenge, dont limit yourself
to just sand.  If
your body has only light surface rust , then think about other media
such as Poly
Abrasives, Walnut shells or even other media that will be a little more
forgiving on your
metal.  I have even had some positive experience with some liquid /
paste strippers.
 

Hope this helps.
