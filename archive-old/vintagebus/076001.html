Subject: tuning the alumihell motor in PHX

as jim ellis can attest, i made it to phoenix... today was the first 
long-distance trip in the 1679cc aluminum  motor from hell, and i had 
some questions:
i am running a NEW brasol 30/31, and it initially had 120 main, 125 
emulsion, and 55 and 65 idle and pilot (tho i always mix up which is 
which). this combo forced me to screw the mixture screw pretty far 
out - 6 or 7 turns - and caused the mixture to hunt btween lean and 
rich at idle. when at speed, the mixture ran full rich (i have an 
aircooled_dot_net afm... nasty lean red l.e.d.s, yellows is leanish, 
greens is richer, and two blue lights at the end. i gather a good jet 
setup would be first blue light at speed, 2nd green light at idle).
changing the emulsion tube to a 135z enabled me to turn the mixture 
screw in some... 5 to 6 turns out ... but i am still getting full 
rich at speed.

outside temp today 112*and a long 45 mph speed limit road led to head 
temp 325 - 350, oil pressure  steady 60 psi, 30 idle (full flow, berg 
pump). i have a berg 'shorty' temp dipstick mounted in the T3 
oilfiller hole and connected to a buzzer, and it was starting to 
'chirp' at me; this means the  oil temp was reaching about 210*, and 
makes no sense as i should have seen high head temps or diminishing 
oil pressure, right?  when i stopped, case was hot to the touch but 
not sizzlingly so... i wouldn't want to hold on to the dipstick, but 
you could touch it.  i have been told that the aluminum case ITSELF 
will run 15* hotter than a stock, so the temp sender may be picking 
that up and sounding tha alarm  before necessary (which means i can't 
use it, which sucks :P).

it also might mean i have an intake leak, but i've been unable to 
find one. or my jets are just plain wrong for phoenix. some folx say 
my carb is too small for the motor, so i've borrowed a 34pict3 for 
kicks, but i could use some jet hints on that carb, too.


btw, i am using a NEW vac dizzy... comes off the 74 manual bugs.
