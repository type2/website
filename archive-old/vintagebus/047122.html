&lt;&lt; Some of the vendors like Wolfsburg carry smaller numbers of the right size
 but they're not necessarily correct... Others like McMasterCarr (sp?) sell
 the right thing but then who needs 1000 rivets when you only need 4....
 sure, you can get 1000 S.S rivets for $25 but what do you do with the other
 996?  ebay at $30/10 rivets!!!!!!  ahhhhh capitalism and frenzy at the same
 location.
 
 Door and gate screws.... where do you get correct ones?
