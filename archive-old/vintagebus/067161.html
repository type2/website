Subject: Re: [VB] Buckin' Bus!

I had a distributor cause this problem before. Actually it was the 
rotor not seated well and rubbed the center (coil plug) on the inside 
of the cap. Plastic shavings everywhere. Got bad enough that it would 
buck like your saying. Instant loss of power. YEEEEE HAAWWWWW.

I've had good luck with new 34 PICT carbs. They work great for me. I 
won't use old ones anymore. If there's an old one on an engine with a 
problem...I just replace it. Rebuilds might help a little...but not 
for long. New ones always work tons better and have a whole life 
ahead of them. My experience.
