&gt;  so we wrestled with the puller for a little while trying to get it to fit 
&gt; and do its job. after a little jimmying with the thing, and right around 
&gt; when I was about to give up on the tool($21 what do you expect) it worked. 
&gt; popped the pulley off.

Hi Kevin,
We have a puller for that.  It is machined out of solid steel.  The pressed 
metal ones do not last long or work well.  Additionally when we install a 
stocker pulley we custom sand the inside diameter to a slide fit onto the 
crank.  This takes a while, but is worth it if later out on the raod the oil 
pump nuts need to be tightened!  Sanding is sped up greatly by rotating the 
pulley on the sand paper just before installing the pulley by hand till it 
gets stuck and pull it back off.  With the previous sand paper marks at a 90 
deree out of the direction of the stuck pulley marks you can easily spot 
where to sand for the tight spots.  Which you sand by hand going in line with 
the crankshaft direction.

&gt; then attack the oil pump. the cover came off no problem-but i couldn't see
&gt; any possible way of jimmying the pump wih a screwdriver-so i checked 
&gt; around.
&gt; and again i wish i lived in CA or AZ or somewhere where they have even 1
&gt; decent vw shop around-so i don't have to mail order everything. no chance 
&gt; of
&gt; an oil pump puller-I need to wait until monday to try and get one from out
&gt; west.

Before you try to use the pulley puller, loosen the case half bolts around 
the oil pump to allow it a little less press fit to drag on it.

&gt; next i thought i might try to fashion a hoover bit, as i have a doghouse oil 
&gt; cooler, and realized with the engine out, that i don't have one. i am going 
&gt; by dale mueller's drawings posted on the net. while waiting for the oil 
&gt; pump puller, i will try to fabricate this little doohickey. has anyone ever 
&gt; done tests on this thing to see if it actually does get the engine to run 
&gt; cooler?

Not us, but it is a no brainer once you have an fresh air tube come off and 
get to see the oil temp raise due to loss of air pressure in the shroud!  
Make sure you use foam rubber to seal around the cooler and to seal the 
exaust shel to the shroud.  Household door foam rubber stripping work perfect 
for these.
