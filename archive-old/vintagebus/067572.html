&gt;Latley my bus has been hard starting.  [...]  Once it gets going it runs
&gt;great, it just doesn't want to start up right away like it used to.

I know it doesn't actually get cold where you are*, but if you have an
electric choke, have you tried adjusting it?  Let the Bus sit overnight
in typical weather, then take off the air cleaner tube and adjust the
choke so that it just closes or maybe a little farther.  Put the air
cleaner tube back on and try it.

This may be pedantic, but you do hit the gas a couple of times before
starting, right?  This sets the choke and pumps a little gas in to get
things fired up.  I know, I know, all Bus drivers know this, but most
of the rest of the word has been driving fuel-injected cars for 15+
years and has forgotten.
