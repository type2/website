 Today I drove a 70 mile round trip in my '55 SC. When I got home, I decided
 to feel the hubs and make sure they were all cool. Checked the drivers front
 and worked my way around. Ouch! got to the last one, passenger front, and
 the hub cap was very hot! Of course, this is the only bearing I packed while
 adjusting the brakes two days ago... I feel stupid.  When I got to this
 wheel to adjust the shoes, I could never get them to tighten using the Muir
 method. I decided to remove the drum have a look see. This particular wheel
 adjusted the opposite from Muir manual instructions. While I had the hub
 off, I decided to go in and really pack some grease. I used Slick 50 grease
 one and packed the hub, re-installed. The only thing I can think I might
 have done wrong is tighten the hub too much. Muir book says to just tighten
 until the washer can barely be turned... I think I tightened way more than
 this. Would over torqueing the nut cause this hot hub?

I had a similar experience, but mine including smoke.   A couple hundred 
miles later it included a complete hydraulic brake failure (hooray for hand 
brake).  My experience was caused by 30 year old brake hoses one collapsed 
inside, keeping pressure at the wheel, warming things up.

yes, wheeling bearing up front should not be over tightened.  Nor should they 
be too loose.  They should be just right.   Like Goldilocks and the three 
bearings.
