&gt; And how ironic a policy...
&gt; 
&gt; When VW was first entering the US market they required new dealers to
&gt; purchase and stock an enormous inventory of parts and service equipment.
&gt; The capital investment was prohibitive, and only parties with a great deal
&gt; of wealth could afford to tie up so much money before selling [or even
&gt; receiving] a single vehicle.

This was in reaction to what had been going on at the time.  The franchise
process was pretty haphazard before VWoA was formed, and a lot of people
were VW dealers who should not have been.  People were getting dealerships
so that they and their friends could get cars at a discount!
 
&gt; And the dealerships were required to maintain this unusually large inventory
&gt; of spares in order to retain their franchises.  VW inventoried and inspected
&gt; the dealerships frequently, and woe unto the dealer found wanting.

And this policy was heavily advertised, which sold a heck of a lot of
cars.  Remember the attitude of the time.  Germany was a _long_ way away
and nobody wanted to have their car waiting for weeks for a part from Der
Fatherland to be shipped (on a real ship!) to the dealer.  This was a
common occurance with people who were brave enough to own a foreign car at
the time.  That huge parts stash put the potential VW customer's mind at
ease.
 
&gt; Even a medium-size VW store had sufficient spares in stock to assemble a
&gt; couple of Beetles, right down to the last nut, bolt, spring, and piece of
&gt; trim.

Yep!  And lucky for them, the parts didn't change all that much over the
years.  Last year's fenders worked just fine on this year's car, another
excellent advertising point!
