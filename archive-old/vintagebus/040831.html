Subject: Truck Drafting

On one snowy trip back to Seattle in my '64, I had
a truck in sight in the distance to guide me through 
the nighttime low visibility gloom.  I could just see 
the lights in the distance, just enough to keep me on 
the road.  The snow was swirling up so much that other 
than his the tail lights and the swirling snow 
illuminated by my lights I couldn't see anything, until . . 

We started up a steeper hill and I was forced to pass.
As I came around, the swirling stopped, the near
whiteout cleared to reveal that it wasn't snowing,
it was only road snow blowing, it was clear out, and
I was really only a couple of bus lengths behind!

The distance between the trucks taillights was narrower
than expected and the lack of visibility tricked my
mind into fully believing that the truck was off in
the distance!  We had started together in a real snow
storm and I didn't notice that it had cleared.
