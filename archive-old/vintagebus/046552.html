 Can anyone suggest where I can find original style bucket seat upholstery 
for 
 1961 bucket seats, preferrably grey?  I have looked through TMI and they 
seem 
 to supply &gt;1962. 
  &gt;&gt;

the early walk through passenger side seat is the same style as the later 
passnger side seat.

the 61 walk through is not the one year only wierd slider,   it is fixed.

it is a different size than the usual 1/3 2/3 drivers seat though.  Not sure 
of sources, perhaps call and see if they know what you are talking about?
