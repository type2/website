Some of you may remember the strange, loud rattling noise my engine was making _at_ KP.

Scott and I stopped by the local VWFLAPS this weekend to pick up some misc spares 
for his trip home, and I had the guy listen to my engine.  He thinks my cam gear
rivets are toast.  By turning the gen pulley with a wrench, there's about 1/2&quot; of
&quot;play&quot; in the crank pulley, meaning you can turn it that far without significant
resistance.  Anyone ever had this problem before?

So, this means I have to get the engine out, torn down and fixed, and back in and
tested in about 3 weeks.  But I can't get started until the parts for the 911 get
here and I get them installed.  It's gonna be a squeeze to get all this done by
The Classic!
