Sad to part with her, but I am losing a garage space so 
she has to go.


I have rebuilt the engine; new pistons and cylinders, 
new bearings, new oil pump with filter, new oil cooler 
(doghouse), new heads (stock sp with valves, etc), new 
clutch and pressure late, new thermostat (flaps are in 
place and operational), and there are only about 200 
miles on the rebuild. I replaced the transmission with a 
RMM rebuilt unit. I replaced all the wheel cylinders and 
flex lines. The clutch cable is new, and the engine has 
a single quiet pack muffler (PO installed). The original 
radio is in the car, I don't know if it works or not. 
The front seats have been redone (non-walkthrough), and 
there is a new cassette player in the car as well. The 
Z-bed is in good shape, the naugehyde is a little dirty, 
same as the cushion over the engine compartment. All 
wood panels are there and in decent shape, some have 
sustained water damage but most are good. The fold up 
table is intact, but also a little dirty. Unfortunately, 
the seat/cabinent that belongs on the bulhead has been 
cut in two, leaving only the seat part in the Camper 
(done by PO). The PO also cut out half of the spare tire 
well, why, I am still not sure. The pop-top is 
functional and in fairly good shape. The car needs some 
attention in the bodywork field. It is a California car, 
it has only been in NJ for two years now and has been 
essentially off the road in a garage for both years, so 
there is some light surface rust on the floors and wheel 
wells. There is one rust out under the drivers feet that 
doesn't look like it should be too difficult to repair 
(I would have done it if I had a welder). The front end 
has been banged up and patched up poorly by a PO, this 
was going to be this summer's project, but unfortunately 
I won't have the time. The rest of the body has some 
dents, but nothing serious. Some PO installed and 
removed scoops too, so the little sheet metal screw 
holes are present. 

To put it in fewer words, the car is mechanically sound 
with a rebuilt drive-train. The body needs attention, 
but, excluding the front. is in fairly good shape. The 
interior is good, except for the half missing tire well 
and cabinent. It is a good project, but can also be 
driven right now if needed or wanted. It is a splitty 
camper in NJ, a relativily rare combination considering 
most have fallen prey to the effects of the rust belt, 
but since it is a CA car, it doesn't have nearly the 
amount of rust one might expect from a 67 camper 
originally from NJ. I am asking for 3500, but most 
serios offers will be considered. If you have any 
questions or comments, please e-mail me or call me at 
908-232-0257 after 6pm on weekdays, anytime on weekends. 

Sincerely,

Chris Phelan
