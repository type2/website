Subject: Re: [VB] Auction Reports,BBB, where are the Deluxes?

Regarding the bus prices at auction. . . there is one thing for which I
feel certain. . .that this is only a temporary blip. All of the
splitties will continue to go up in value and, especially, the 23 window
deluxes. Probably faster than the Qualcom stock, too :)

Certainly, part of what is elevating these prices is the internet
itself. There are so many good bus sites, loaded with information. And
it is obvious to me just how rapidly the net is expanding by just
looking at the aircooled buy-sell pages every day. When I first jumped
on, the buy-sell had approximately 100 items for sale for the last 30
days. Now, there are 500 items for sale for the last 15 days!!! And yet,
I think the numbers show that 80% of the population aint on the net yet.
As more and more people log on and visit these sites, more will be
induced to take the plunge. And people are very greedy, too. So if they
see bus prices rising, they will jump on the bandwagon more quickly. It
is a fact of life that, in the art world, it is often easier to sell a
&quot;limited edition collectors print&quot; than the original it was printed from
and often for more money!!! So dont expect these prces to stay low.

But it truley is the wrong reason for owning a bus. And as for mine. . .
I intend to NEVER SELL!!
