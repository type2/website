Subject: Split Window for Sale

 If anyone is interested, my neighbor has a 1967 split-window for sale. 
 It's located in the Florida Panhandle and is aqua and white.  It has a 
 rebuilt motor and transmission. There's some rust on the bus but not a 
 lot.  It runs great and she's parting with it sadly.  Her asking price 
 is $7,000.  If you or someone you know is looking for these increasingly =
 rare gems, let me know.  Thanks.
 
 
 Jack
