Subject: Re: Fw: [VB] Compressors and Sandblasting
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

    Compressors are like any other tool, go big or go home. An industrial 
size one from a supplier wont cost much more than a Home Despot model, but 
will have the advantage of size, this means you can work longer before your 
compressor kicks in a definite advantage when sandblasting or painting or 
grinding, things that take a lot of cfm. Plus they can be rebuilt. The one I 
had previous had a date of 1944 on the tank! The one I have now is 160gal 
220v, I never run out of air. 'course the garage floor vibrates when it runs
