Subject: re: Bus tires

us bus folks have it easy with tires... try finding replacements for a 1950
Ch*vy 1/2 ton with 16&quot; rims! Finally found some that were 30 years old, but
work fine for in-town.

at leasty the tire guys have SEEN tires like what I want when I roll in my
65's rims................

70 Neunsitzer
65 Pritschenwagen
