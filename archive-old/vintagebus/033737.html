   Sorry to all those that called or e-mailed today not being here to talk
or e-mail you back, here's why.

  A very good friends daughter died a couple days ago, she was 26 years old.
(bus content, these people always let me stay and/or store buses at there
house when ever I needed). They had just moved back to Kansas, arrived there
on Sat evening (from Las Vegas) only to get a phone call that there daughter
died in her sleep sometime Sat night or Sunday morning. This is always a sad
moment especially when somebody you know and care about passes away for no
reason. What this does is make me think how lucky we all are to have good
friends and I can say I have made some good friends off of this list. May
she rest in peace


Ronnie   dropping everything to help a friend
