I ordered a complete exhaust system from Ron for my '71.  It sat on the
shelf for several months unopened.  When I finally got around to looking
at it I noticed that the tailpipe bracket and install kit was missing.  I
emailed Ron, expecting a hassle (after all, it was months ago!), but
experienced no problem.  I had the parts in hand within a week.

I don't do a lot of business with Ron, and he may not be perfect, but give
him a chance and I'm sure that he'll make things right.  OTOH, blast him
on the list before giving him the opportunity to make you happy and I
wouldn't blame him for any action!  You catch more flies with honey than
with vinegar.
