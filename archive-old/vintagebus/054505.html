Subject: Re: [VB] Compression ratios on SP engine + clutch disc question

Hi Ric,
Definitely rework the head chambers or get matching new heads and still work 
them so they are exactly the same volume and shim under the cylinders only.  
We have been having good results with 7.1:1 CR in our bus.  As for clutch 
pressure plate we only use 200mm nine spring.  We totaled out a 200mm 
diaphram clutch disc in less than a month of carrying no loads in our truck 
with big bore 40HP engine and stock tranny.  Never had any problem with the 
nine spring clutch pressure plate in years and never slips.  Since we are not 
into drag racing the spring centered clutch discs do help take some of the 
clutch shock off the engine to improve longevity.  Eric&amp;Barb
