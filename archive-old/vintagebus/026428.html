I have been trying to get a copy of Bob Hoover's postings for several years.
I started to print them out several years ago, but when I had to buy my
first $35 cartrage, I stopped.  When I went back to look something up, the
listings were removed by his request.  This was some of the best and
funniest VW stuff I've ever read.  I understand that there are CDs out, but
I haven't been able to locate one.  Do any of you hae one and be willing to
part with it? If so, please contact me.
