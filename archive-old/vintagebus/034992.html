Hi Ray,
Gasket, and you can easily make one for your use out of ceral box cardboard.
 
 Also, looking in parts catalogs for a view of this I saw an oil filler base 
gasket and a block off plate.  What is this plate for?  Is it there on all 
engines or does it have a special function for some weird application? &gt;&gt;
Actually there should be two gasket there one on top and one below the 
deflector plate which helps keep oil from being slung up and out of the 
engine through the breather tubes.
