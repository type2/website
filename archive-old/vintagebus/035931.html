My buddy recently purchased a 67 21 window rag. His bod isn't too bad(needs 
the usual rockers, doglegs, and has some minor window lip rot), but after I 
finally got to see it today, I noticed his frame rails are shot.
I have a 65 that I am parting out and it has perfect frame rails. I don't 
think I need to explain what I am getting at. I swap pans on type 1's all the 
time, but it doesn't appear to be as easy on a bus. Any ideas????
