&gt; My clutch stopped working again.  Last night coming home, as I got off the

Hi Bob,
Sounds like you might not have greased the needle bearings in the FW gland 
bolt.  Remove engine, remove FW gland bolt and either replace the entire bolt 
or the needle bearings inside it that the rear portion of the tranny input 
shaft rides inside of.  Without these bearings the input shaft wobbles around 
which in turn allows the clutch disc to wobble around and touch the FW and 
clutch pressure plate continuously!
  As a rule when we reinstall the engine we lightly grease the tranny input 
shaft where it rides on the needle bearings.  That way they are kept greased 
and last just about forever.
