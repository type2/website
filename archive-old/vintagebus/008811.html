Someone just asked me for a recommendation on shipping a VW from
San Diego to Chicago. He has checked out a couple of transport firms and
they want around $1100.00. Enclosed and insured.
Has anyone on the list had experience with this....He and I would appreciate
some words of wisdom on getting this done without unnecessary headaches. I
think $1100.00 is more than he can afford.
thanks
John
