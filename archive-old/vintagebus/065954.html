Subject: RE: [VB] aluminum case update

It kind of sounds like the top of the lifter bores needed to be decked and
chamfered like you do for after market high lift cams.

so the motor is in the car and running... but has a problem:
  we took a listening tube and spent an hour tracking a loud noise in
the aluminum engine. DEFINITELY internal,  along the lifter area on
the right side. either something is banging into the case, or the
(solid) lifters have a problem on the pushrod end. i clearanced,
miked and decked the hell outa this motor, so if its a clearance
issue, it is due to a nonspec case.

it SOUNDS like it is ONCE per valve opening...  not as fast as the
engine rpms.  perhaps a lifter is hitting something; or while the
pushrods are not FLEXING as bad as EX #1 once did, but still one is
not right in the lifter cup, and is rattling around.
if i take the pushrods off of each cylinder in turn, the noise should
go away IF the pushrods are the problem (do i pull the sparkplug on
that cylinder for this test, or just the wire)?
if the noise doesn't go away, i;m f*cked. no tips for the holidays :P

other than that, it runs great :)  i have a 30/31 on it now that
won't hold an even idle, so i ordered a new one - i'm sick of
screwing with worn carbs!  later on i'll try and find out why the
30P1 i had rebuilt wouldn't even idle on this motor....

main is 125, air jet is 130y, pilot and idle jets are 50s. runs rich,
but not TOO bad. i'll eventually try a 122.5, and then a 125 and a
135z, and see which setup i like better.  runs strong despite the
noise!
