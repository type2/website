Subject: Re: trip reports suck


Well, this is another posting supporting trip reports.

I like to travel in my bus but I don't get to go on such trips as often
as I'd like so I very much enjoy reading other people's bus trip reports.
I enjoy writing trip reports also because it allows me to re-live the trip
to some extent and posting them to the mailing list gives others the chance
to enjoy my trip (a little).

Also, I've often found that traveling in my '66 bus teaches me a lot about
the advantages and disadvantages of the vehicle for long distance travel.
Reading other's trip reports tells me what other possible troubles I might
encounter and how they were solved.

For example, I just read George Lyle's trip report which I greatly enjoyed
both because I learned some information about places to go as well as because
he went some places I'm very familier with (I've eaten green chile
cheeseburgers at the Owl Bar &amp; Cafe in San Antonio NM many, many times :-)
In addition, I am now aware that tread separation in tires is perhaps
more common than I thought! Two in one day!

So thumbs up for trip reports!!  (and thanks to George for typing his up)
