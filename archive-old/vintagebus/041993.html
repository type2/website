Oddly enough, a fair number of production vehicles have plastic tanks.  As
long as the tank has sufficient UV protection (to prevent embrittlement
from sunlight) it is a very good material for this application.  Plastic
tanks tend to bend and stretch in collisions where metal tanks will split
open.

Unfortunately, it is not easy to build plastic tanks without large molds.
If you aren't making 1000 of them the cost is very high per unit.
