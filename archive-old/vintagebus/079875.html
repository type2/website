Subject: Accelorator cable (61DC)

Can anyone tell me the length of the end barrel for a
stock accelorator cable for a 61 double cab?  I have 
a new cable that had a end barrel that was about 1.5&quot;
long.  It would not go thru the tube though.  It got
stuck about 9&quot; from the rear of the bus.  (I tried to
push it thru from both ends and it gets stuck at the
same point.

I ground the barrel down to .5&quot; and still it will not
go.  I have traced the tube back to the area and there
is a stock looking bend there as it goes around the
torsion tube area.  It does not look crushed either. 
Seams to me the stock barrel was about 1&quot; long but i
do not have one hanging around.  Anyone know or faced
a similar problem?  I imagine there is something in
there but just thought i would ask.

Thanks
