 '64 Sundial Camper Bus For Sale    Nov. 26, 2000  Price:       800$ 
Obo/Trades?  
Late 1964 bench seat Sundial camper bus. Original color was turkis. Complete 
less motor, rims and tires, and rear bumper (has rear overriders). I have a 
set of rims and tires which can be used for transport only, NOT INCLUDED. 
Restorable. Dry California bus. Somewhat rough (dents) but not too bad. No 
*MAJOR* accidents, just bumps and bruises. Great front clip, decent front 
floors, nice dash, nice corners, cut wheel wells, nice interior, good doors, 
dry rockers. Has title. Must sell ASAP. Will be at the SOTO meet and Pomona 
next weekend if not sold sooner. Price is *SUPER* flexible (I'd like to see 
this bus saved). After Pomona the bus will be parted out/cut up due to lack 
of storage. (Email me for individual needs) If your looking for a great &quot;base 
car&quot; to polish/restore into perfection this would be it. Its totally 
restorable. Slap a 500$ paint job on it and this thing has &quot;Soyanora&quot; written 
all over it. I rather sell this BEFORE the SOTO meet so I can drive my 57 
standard there instead of a Dodge with a camper in back. Trades for pre-58 
bus parts and accessories considered. ***I HAVE PHOTOS****Thanks- Greg
