Subject: re:wiper motor

well, i got my motor out and apart yesterday...

as per list suggestions:
took the parcel tray out, removed the radio, took the wipers and nuts from
outside bus off stems.

then removed single bolt that was hidden by parcel tray.

wiggled the whole unit out. didn't need to remove my speaker, but the magnet
kept trying to grab the wiper assembly.

I popped the bushings off, put some white lithium grease on these fittings,
then opened the motor, alittle bit of wiggling, scraped out as much of the
old grease as possible, with q-tips, little wood scraps, paper towels, shot
of carb cleaner....then repacked with the white lithium grease. back
together.

reinstall:
just recently someone posted about the difficulty of hooking the wiring
up...i just hooked the wires up before installing the assmebly.

everthing back together-replaced the radio with another one i got from a
fellow list member-rex rogers i believe. my original radio worked, but it
needed an auxiliary power switch. this one doesn't. so it turns on and off
real easily, but it doesn't want to share any of its receptiong with me(ie
it doesn't make any noise) maybe i will have to take the rotary switch from
the replacement, and put it in the original.

well thaks for the wiper motor tips-it works well now-but then again the
weather is warm again. we'll see when the regular cold weather comes
back....
