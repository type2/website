I also needed to buy a 17mm allen wrench and NAPA informed my that they do
not carry metric sizes. The  guy stocking the shelves at Walmart in the oil
section did not know what gear oil was and they guy at Autozone did not know
what the designations in GL(x) meant.
 I went so Sears to by the 17mm allen wrench ($8.95) .
&lt;&lt;snip&gt;&gt;

I had a recent experience with adding gear oil on my '67.  I put a qt+ of
GL4-5 from NAPA in (sounds like I am scr**ed as well, and I will be busy
this weekend).   Anyway I went down to Sears and spent $8.95 for a 17mm
allen wrench.  The problem I had was that I  _could_not_  get an angle to
get
it open; I fought with it for a couple of hours before I finally gave up in
disgust.  I went over to a FLAP (Import Auto in Lakeland, FL is great; end
shameless plug for Keith and Mickey) and they had a special tool from EMPI
that had a 17mm allen wrench head on a 3/8 inch socket.  I was able to get
it open in about 5 minutes.  The EMPI transaxle tool cost me $3.25, and
worth every penny!!
