7-layers of paint weren't standard until the 1958 and later &quot;Hippie Package&quot;
which also came with cut wheel wells, side scoops and the window sticker
option.

&gt; There are two small screws (four total) on the sides of the frames... dig
&gt; around in the 7 layers (my guess) of paint... you'll find them.  Remove the
&gt; screws and carefully spread the frames apart (sideways).  (I'm assuming the
&gt; frames are out of the bus already)
