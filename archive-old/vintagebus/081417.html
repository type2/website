Subject: Re: [VB] re:tires

Take a look at:
http://www.bridgestonetire_dot_com/tireselector/index_bs.asp?pagesource=searchbyproduct

Seems that the smallest tire is a P205-75R15, Sorry about that if you have
14&quot; rims. Looks like I will need to find something else to use for a spare
as these are too wide for the spare tire well behind my 2/3 front seat.
Anyone want to purchase an unused previously owned tire?

Chris

&gt; I thought that was on the &quot;Revo&quot; design IIRC, no? That model of dueler is
&gt; not avaliable in the 195/75R14 size. But it's been over a year since I
&gt; bought mine, so I don't remember too well.
