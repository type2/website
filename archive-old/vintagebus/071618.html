Subject: Re: [VB] new (old) engine

&gt;Come on, I know everyone has an opinion. I appreciate reading your
&gt; advice. What do you think?

$450 for a 71 Ghia Mystery Engine ?!!!
Did you save half the cost of a new bottom end,
or are you halfway towards one :)?!!
Check the endplay. If it is out of spec, pull the flywheel
and wiggle the main bearing.This is an indication of
high mileage and a primary consideration for rebuilding.
It's also a fine consideration for a refund:).
If you are keeping it, verify the HIOP.
Do a leak-down test, it is more definitive than compression
If these indicators are substandard, take it apart, linebore
and replace the bearings, rebuild the heads, install a
new oil cooler and p/c :)
Change the muffler to a proper bus exhaust.
Start a maintenance notepad.

&gt; My 1600 single port began making knocking sounds. I have no idea how many
&gt; miles are on it. It probably needs to be disassembled to find the source
of
&gt; the knock. Meanwhile, I bought a used engine from a '71 Ghia. It's a 1600
cc
&gt; dual port, push-pull distributor, single carb, dog house set up, quiet
pack
&gt; exhaust. The guy started it up on the ground for me. I sounded smooth. Who
&gt; knows how long it will last. I paid $450 for it. Before I put it into my
57
&gt; van, I want to at least clean it up. I pulled the fan off and found solid
&gt; baked-on grease between the jug cooling fins closest to the case. Signs of
&gt; overheating. Hopefully not damaged. I plan to do a compression test after
I
&gt; put it in my van. Does anyone think I should pull the heads off first?
What is
&gt; the downside? Any precautions other that the obvious? The push rods tubes
look
&gt; like they could stand new seals. Maybe would be a good idea. What is your
&gt; opinion? Come on, I know everyone has an opinion. I appreciate reading
your
&gt; advice. What do you think?
