Hi matt,

You mention, &quot;Consider a 2 gauge cable, especially if your Bus is 6 V.&quot;

I did a quick internet search and there is 2 gauge and 2/0 gauge. Supposedly
the 2/0 gauge is even thicker, stronger connections etc. Any experience with
this stuff? Is it worth going to 2/0 gauge, or is that stuff so thick it's
hard to use? Does 2/0 mean that basically it is between 2 and 0 gauge?

From one site:
&quot;BATTERY CABLE ASSEMBLIES 100% copper wire with molded-on battery terminal
to maximize conductivity Choice of 2-gauge or 2/0-gauge cable (twice the
area of conductivity of 2-gauge) Lengths ranging from 12&quot; to 72&quot; All have
crimped-on lug ends. 2-gauge cable has 3/8&quot; center hold, 2/0-gauge cable has
larger lug end with 1/2&quot; center hole and shrink tubing to cover joint. All
have black PVC insulation. 2/0-gauge also has larger, more durable
terminal.&quot;
