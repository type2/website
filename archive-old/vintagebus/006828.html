I have new 12 solenoids or just the end caps if you need, Generally it's
just the contacts in the solenoid that went bad and not the electro magnet,
The end caps are pretty straight forward to change you just have to unsolder
the 2 connector wires and apart they come (after you remove the screws),
slip the end cap on, solder the wires back and you got a new solenoid.

Hi Jim,
First check the amount of voltage getting to the solinoid!  We had the same 
problem and it turned out mostly to be the original ignition switch, and the

rest bad dirty connections from the battery on through the wiring to the 
front.  Using those darn solinoid relays without first checking/cleaning 
things just ends up curing only one symptom and lets the rest of the 
electrical system run dim lights and slooooow wipers, signals.    Eric&amp;Barb
