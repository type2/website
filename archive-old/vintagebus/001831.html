Hey Volks

I've posted some pics of my Zebra Bus to Thom's gallery:
http://www.vintagebus_dot_com/gallery/art.html

It is one of the 1975 Brazilian splitties assembled in South Africa. They
were assembled in SA one year only from Brazilian CKD kits. Only 789 of
these RHD splitties  were produced, and were sold under the model name
&quot;Fleetline&quot;. There were three variants: 15-window Kombi, panelvan, and
wide-body pick-up. You can see a signwritten panel version at:
