Subject: Re: [VB] 6V vs 12V

i had a 28-pic 1600 single port engine built for my 12 volt converted sunroof bug.  after a couple of months together, the engine in my '67 blew and i pulled the one from my sunroof and used it in my '67.  a year later i finished the engine for my '67, my sunroof picked up another 1600 along the way and i had a spare.  fortunately for me i had a vw to put it in - my single cab.

i've often thought that the stupidest thing done to my sunroof was converting it to 12 volt and i didn't want to do the same thing to my truck even though it doesn't have a gas gauge and radio like my sunroof does.  so i took the 12 volt 1600 and converted it to 6 volt - flywheel, coil, generator and choke (a 30-pic for the 28).

i had no difficulty finding parts and used the local vw parts place, my mechanic or a napa.  kragen and grand auto were major losers for 6-volt stuff.

the winters here are mild and my truck starts easily with a push if it won't start via the ignition.  i’m not sorry that my truck is 6 volt and i've not found it difficult to get parts for it.  perhaps one day, my sunroof will go back to 6 volt too.
