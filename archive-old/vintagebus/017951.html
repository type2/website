It soudns like a decent system, but i am not sure i understand its
effectiveness....at one point they wrote:

&quot;In 100 degree (38 C) heat the Icester produces 65 F. (19 C.) (+-) of Air
Conditioned comfort out of the powerful blower using cubed or
block ice. Reusable Freeze Packs will be about 78 F. (25 C) in the 100 F. (38
C) heat. In general cubed ice is used up quicker than block ice of
equal weight. The length of time the reusable Freeze Packs perform depends on
the quantity that are used.&quot;

which sounds good, great even, unfortunately later on teh same page they
wrote:

&quot;The air will be on the average 10 degrees cooler than the air going in. For
example if the air in the non air conditioned room is 85
degrees, the cool dry air will be 75 degrees. You can continue to re-circulate
the cooled air with the AC110 (no venting of any kind is
needed) therefore eventually it will begin to cool the ambient air down. In
the meantime you will have cool dry air blowing directly on you.&quot;

to me that sounds like if it is 100 degrees out, this fan is going to blow 90
degree air on me. I don't think that will cool me down too much.
