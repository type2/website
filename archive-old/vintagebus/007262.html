I didn't work as hard today.  I just did a bunch of little stuff to fritter
away the afternoon.  Tomorrow I guess I'll set the bus down and roll it out
of the shop and get ready to pull the the rear end out of it in prep for the
swap.

I adjusted the brakes, put the tires on, ran a horn wire, spliced the wiring
harness back together underneath the bus and used heat-shrink tubing and
black tape to hold it all together.  I put on some good tunes and with some
wd40, I pumped the ebrake lever in time to the music until it was bleeding
orange and loosened right up.  Darn thing was near seized before I worked it
over.  I installed the turn signal lever and steering wheel, put the
accelerator pedal rubber in the hole, put a new connector on the end of the
horn wire that comes out of the harness, and painted the gas pedal and
actuator rod.  I took a time out and cleaned up all the tools, the shop and
reorganized the tools laying all over the floor in the bus.  Then I put the
speedo cable in a drill.  I ran it while feeding oil into the speedo end and
within about 5 minutes I had everything lubed up great.  I put the speedo in
but not before confirming my drill runs at 55mph. :-)  I adjusted the wiper
blade arms because they hung too far to the passenger side.

That just about did it.  More later...
