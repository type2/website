early 67s did not come with back up lights BTW.   Actually, in the euro market
buses, even some 68-71 bay windows did not have backup lights.  Or opening
vent windows in the front doors.   Guess those were options.   And I saw
Vanagons with jailbars.   

 Also, I changed my auto insurance, and my 61 non sunroof deluxe is listed as
a '61 Vanagon'.   wow, I bet I have the earliest vanagon made.
