Subject: oil consumption

Just a general question/comment on newer cars: I went with my friend to drop
off a newer Audi for it's 50,000 maintenance check. I think it is a 2001 or
something like that. Anyway she was telling me that she was supposed to top
the oil off on the thing, i.e. add a quart of synthetic or something. And I
was saying-&quot;there's no way a car this new should need more oil, unless
something is wrong with it. Basically a car this new should not be leaking
oil-so if it is low, it must be burning oil, which indicates a problem to
me.&quot;

Anyway we get to the dealer, and I ask the guy behind the counter about it,
and he says-the engine can burn a quart per 1000 miles and still be within
spec, he then went on to say it had something to do with fuel efficiency
etc. 

I don't buy it.  How could you possibly engineer an automobile, that would
burn a quart of oil per 1000 miles and still be within spec. My VW's don't
burn that much oil, and they get better mileage that this new Audi.

Anyone else ever heard this?
