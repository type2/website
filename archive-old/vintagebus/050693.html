Subject: Re: [VB] (Friday) Don't forget... Was Header woes

awile back while attempting to avoid a traffic light
by 
cutting through a gas station,I was going about
30-35mph in my very low 15 window bus I heard a loud
thud as the bus sprung up into the air! then as the
suspension was in rebound something slapped me on the
forehead ..then another &quot;thud&quot;
turns out the steering box is your worst enemy on a
slammed bus.. I clipped one of those 
little round caps where they fill the gas stations
tanks..then the horn button popped off on impact and
hit me on the forehead..the second thud was yet
another filler cap..I must have had the bus aimed just
right!
it actually sheared bolts off the cover plate on the
box!

I have since converted the bus to a rack and pinion
steering setup now the lowest point of the bus is the
beam itself!
