I rode in a friend's lowered bus recently and darn near ended up with internal injuries after a half hour from the bumpy ride.  My stock height bus isn't that bumpy, even when I take it off road.  I have never rolled a bus (knock on wood) and have never owned and driven a lowered bus, and I have been known to do some crazy driving and driving in odd conditions when the situation warented it.  I prefer not to lower my buses because I like the stock look and like to be able to have enough clearance to drive over a parking block or a tire tread in the road without fear of hitting it.  But it is a personal preference.  Drive it lowered for a bit, and if you soon feel your kidneys are bouncing around inside you like a couple of jumping beans than give it a try stock height.  It is all a preference thing.

My 2 cents.
Richard
