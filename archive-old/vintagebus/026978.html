Many ask for my source. Fair enough.

Taylor's original question was:

 &quot;On the freeway I really don't take it much over
60...sounds like it's running too high at 65. Can anyone
give me some numbers?&quot;

Mike has contributed to the thread and posted that:

&quot;I make about 67 MPH (tested to be accurate) at about 4000
RPM with 26.5&quot;
diameter tires and I know I have (or at least paid for) a
4.125 R&amp;P and that
pretty much corresponds to the speed/rev table that was
posted.&quot;

If I read his post correctly, even with a 1776 and dual
40's, he still finds his top speed limited to 67 mph _at_4Krpm.
I believe everything he wrote; I've had the same experience.

If all Mike can pull is 67mph _at_4Krpm in 4th, I think my
point is made. Will anyone argue that 4Krpm is to high for
freeway driving? And in 4th gear he can't seem to do any
better;&lt;) Has anyone on the list got a split that can pull
5Krpm in 4th? I don't believe it can be done with a stock
setup.

The source for the rpm limiters is the BERG '96 catalogue,
pg. 87-88. They recommend a 5.8Krpm cutout for all T2s
because of &quot;low gear ratios.&quot; He claims that he had a 50%
increase in head life using a 5,850rpm limiter in his T2.

BENTLEY lists the 1500 engine as having an output of SAE 51
bhp _at_4Krpm as the maximum output. Exactly the limit Mike
found.

BENTLEY lists the 1200 40hp using a 4.125R/P W/1.39RG as
yielding 60mph _at_3.6Krpm as the top road speed using 26&quot;
tires. The 1500 51hp using a 4.125R/P W/1.26RG gets 68mph
_at_3.8Krpm. Using the 4.375R/P, 65mph _at_4050rpm.

So even a stronger engine will not make you go any faster.
You can there quicker, but you don't go no faster. 

I stand by my opinion.

Douglas
