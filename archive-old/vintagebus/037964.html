&lt;&lt; How does the fuel guage work with this set-up? &gt;&gt;

Hi Steve,
Well in our 60 panel camper conversion we have no gas gauge as of yet!  In 
our 63 SC with 6 volts the stock fuel gauge works well with the 12 volt late 
model sender.  It reads full, reserve, and empty when the tank is, though it 
reads 1/2 and 1/4 when it really is about 2/3 and 1/3 full.   Eric&amp;Barb
