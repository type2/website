&lt;&lt; Why does this always happen to me. I have a Binz # 114 ( oldest one

documented so far) and no one wants them and thinks they are wierd, so i

sold it. Same thing happened with the 54 DOUBLE DOOR Barndoor panel I had in

1990, no one wanted barndoors so I finally traded it for a crewcab. When was

the last time you say in person a barndoor doubledoor? Even Dave Heard and

Tony ( the hat) didn't want it.

 Maybe I'm a trend setter, so you all better watch old VW Howard and what

I'm working on now as they are sure to be hotter than Kyle's shooters next

year. My moto : BUY HIGH AND SELL LOW 2 or 3 years ahead of time.

 See you all at Phoenix April 1st and Kelly Park week after.
