&gt; .....Ouch! You guys paying $2.25 for gas? I just filled up this morning
for a

&gt; coming down back closer to reality everywhere but CA. A friend of mine in
&gt; Worland WY was complaining that gas prices were too high there also. He's
had
&gt; to pay $1.12.9 for months now and he's not liking it one bit. Poor baby.
Wish
&gt; I had his bad luck!

    Had to pay as much as $2.40 a gal. for 91 octane coming &amp; going to BYOB
thru Calif. &amp; Nevada. Only ran out one time-a personal best.

Tom Buese-big headwinds both ways!
