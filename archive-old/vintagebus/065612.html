Subject: I'm in need of a part

I am in need of the lower arm (lever?) that attaches from the side door
lock that slides into the frame when the door is shut.  I was
investigating the locks on my bus when I discovered that this piece was
missing, no wonder water was coming in through the bottom of the door.
If you have the part please let me know.  I will also be posting a part
wanted ad on TheSamba, but I thought I would try here first.
