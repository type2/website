Subject: 67 project dilemma

Like so many of you, I have done a foolish thing - I bought a 67 Bus at a
police auction today... this makes 4 vw (and one Ch_at_vy) projects in the
yard! I count the 70, despite its daily driver-ish status, as a project :)

Quick-look details:
Title sez VIN 257117746    standard-looking microbus; walkthru, cargodoors
on right, had a deluxe clock at one time. No speedo.
Bashy nose, rotten front floor. Cut wheel wells, WITH screwholes for
after-market flares :P  Didn't see any trim holes on the body. Cargo floor
is buried under front bumper, carpet and boxes. Rear seat - might not have
the backrest - but no middle...  Missing windshields, but looks like the
rest of the glass is there and intact; popouts are a mix of good- and
broken-latched. Most of the knobs and such seem to be present throughout
the bus. No interior or campy stuff.  HAD a heater, but it is gone.
No motor, but pieces of it in the car. Has tranny; it and reduxes look leaky.

Ugly mint green and black homebrew paint job.

I was originally gonna use this to donate stuff to the 65, but unless there
is horridness lurking under the cargo floor, this is too good a bus to
hack. Nothing SPECIAL mind... just a good, easily restored bus at first
glance. I will report back once the towtruck delivers it; my options are
restore (no time or money for this many projects, tho), sell as is or ...
well, I DON&quot;T want to part it out, so let's hope the tacky paint ain't
hiding too much.

FWIW, any of you Ghia freaks, I passed on a decent 74 (it went for $200)...
primered, and needing a bit of repair on the taillight housing on one side,
but nice otherwise. Had a lot of new parts in it. Motor spun freely by hand
(decent compression resistance), but we didn't try and start it... no key.
(Impressed the hell outta the folks there by sauntering up to the LOCKED
Ghia and saying, &quot;here, let me try my Bus key;&quot; sure enough, it worked!
This is a good tip; anytime you have a doorhandle w/o keys, try the ones
you have laying around - they will often work!  It also makes one a little
less confident in locking things up :) )  This Ghia is in Austin, TX, and
the buyer was talking about parting it, but mentioned he would be happy to
sell complete if he made a few hunnert. I bet he would let it go for $500;
pmail me if you want his number.
