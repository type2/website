&gt;    1. rubber against the frame of the bus, this seal is flat on one side
&gt; and curved on the other.  Does the curved side face toward the inside of
&gt; the bus and the flat side up against the popout window?   What type of
&gt; glue should I use to fix that seal to the window frame?

3M trim adhesive - the black stuf.

&gt;   2. rubber around the popout frame, I'm guessing no glue here.
&gt; correct?

Correct.

&gt;   3. popout frame to glass seal, anything between the frame and the
&gt; seal?

No.

&gt; Door Windows -
&gt;     What should I use to cement the felt strips in place?

I just just a dab of the 3m stuff to help hold it down.

&gt;     Same for the little vent window rubber at the front of the frame?

I don't use any on it.

&gt; Door Rubber
&gt;     Which glue would I use for the door seals?

Same 3M stuff.
