Thanks Rennie.  I sent you're list off to my son so he can go bolt shopping
before I get home this weekend.

I'm in Sylmar in the north end of the San Fernando valley.

The bolts are 12mm x 1.5 pitch and are 1.5&quot; long, according to ETKA.  You
would
need 8 of these to bolt the reduction boxes to the spring plates.

the studs sticking out of the front mount are 10mm and the nuts that have a
15mm
head are the easiest to use, you need 2 or 4 of those.  The 2 that go from
the
mount to the nose cone were originally 14mm head, but they are nearly
impossible
to find.

The bolts, nuts and washers for the STOCK cradle to the cradle mounts are
8mm x
10mm, don't forget lock washers.  It sucks to pull the motor to tighten
these.

Extra 8mm nuts (13mm head size) are a must.

That would be enough to at least be able to roll it.

As far as locating the mounts, they are available at almost any FLAPS.
Where is
So Cal?

&gt; Or more correctly &quot;Aw Bolts&quot;
&gt;
&gt; Short story:
&gt; Does anyone know what size bolts I need to install the trans into my '60
SC?
&gt;
&gt; Long story:
&gt; I have a '60 SC I bought pretty much as you see at www.wyricks_dot_com/vw .
It
&gt; was too easy to stay in Southern California and finish the restoration.
So
&gt; to make it more interesting, I took a job offer in Seattle and will be
&gt; moving at the end of October.  In fact, I am already working in Seattle as
I
&gt; write this and am flying back and forth on the weekends to get things
ready
&gt; for the move.
&gt;
&gt; I have a flat bed trailer ready, but it'd be a lot easier if I had tires
&gt; under the SC.  The front end is ready to go, so I sent the trans off and
had
&gt; it completely rebuilt all the way out to the brake backing plates and a
&gt; friend is picking that up from the shop this week.
&gt;
&gt; So far, so good.
&gt;
&gt; The job I now face (besides ordering mounts from somewhere and getting
them
&gt; delivered before Friday since I didn't think about that until just today)
is
&gt; to mount the trans so I can bolt the wheels on to it.  The fun part is
that
&gt; I'll have just one day to do it.  No problem...if I have the bolts on
hand.
&gt; That is a big IF since I didn't take it apart and haven't seen any bolts
in
&gt; the boxes of stuff I got w/the truck.
&gt;
&gt; So, if anyone happens to know what I'll need I'll sleep a lot better this
&gt; week in anticipation of the job ahead of me.
&gt;
&gt; Thanks in advance,
&gt;
&gt; -Tom
