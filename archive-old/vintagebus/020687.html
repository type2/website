&gt; &gt; Hey,
&gt; &gt; I've noticed that a lot of cars for sale on the 'net
&gt; &gt; or in online auctions have the license plate removed
&gt; &gt; or purposely blurred-out in the pics.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Why is this?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Is there some risk involved with people knowing your
&gt; &gt; plate?
&gt; 
&gt; I can only imagine that someone thinks that a perp will look up the 
license
&gt; plate and then hightail it over to the registered address with a 
flatbed and
&gt; remove the vehicle in the dead of night.

It also prevents buyers (and law enforcement) from running a Carfax or 
DMV check on the vehicle.  It wouldn't do for the buyer to find out 
that the vehicle doesn't really belong to the seller or that the 
vehicle was in a major accident etc.

Buyer beware!

George
