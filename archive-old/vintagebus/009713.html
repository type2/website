I've owned my baby (Sally) for two years now and neverbeen want to wish for
another vehicle.
Let me elaborate on her:
she's a 1966 micro that can to me with 55,000 miles and the original engine.
she had some pretty bad body parts that are slowly being fixed/replaced and
the PO cut a sun roof, added skylights, and converted her to 12v
She's used almost daily and I've logged more tan 22,000 miles since
valentines two years ago only to be stranded once....once for five minutes
taht is since I carry a spare set of points (my new ones of two weeks
snapped the plastic post=( so if you use points, stick w/ the fiber ones=)
I change her oil every 2000-2500 miles, gap points around 4-5000 miles and
other maintainance.
She's taken me on multiple Long road trips, this last summer to Washington
and around, no problem (approx 4,000 miles of hills and valleys, even some
ridiculous mountains =)
I used to put more miles in the city on her but two weeks ago took out all
the popouts to clean them up. But am headed on 700 mile roadtrip tonight=)

Any volkswagen can be driven forever as long as you love them and live up to
your promises=) A sixty seven bus should be fine as a daily driver, my bus
should have the same tranny gearing and drives 60-65 no prob, but I never
ask for more than that, as she starts to scream at 67. Seems happy enough at
65 but I usually drive at 60 since I've learned that I don't need to hurry
to get anywhere, I've got my bus and my smile, what else could I need=)

If you have any other specific questions or comments, feel free to email and
I'tt tell you what I can=)
Hope your bus treats you as well as mine has=)
