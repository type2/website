In a message dated 98-11-02 11:54:13 EST, you write:

&lt;&lt; First, the oil pickup tube in the bottom of the right case half
 is loose in it's hole.  I can move it up and down and about
 1/2 inch in and out of the hole in the case that it fits into.
 I can see a few peen marks both on the tube near it's insertion
 as well as on the case itself which tell me that attempts have
 been made in the past to fix the problem.  How can I tighten up
 this tube?  Is peening the way to do it?  Can I remove the
 tube completely and stretch it?  I notice that there is a plug
 in the case over the mounting point but haven't attempted to
 remove this plug, it doesn't look like a screwdriver would fit
 in the slot properly.&gt;&gt;
You might want to have the oil pickup tube hole in the case drilled and reamed
for the later larger sized pickup tube that has the bolting leg on it to
connect to one of the sump plate studs.  While you are having this done you
will have to have the end plug removed and you might as well have the passage
into and out of the oil pump enlarged.
 
 &lt;&lt; I'm still working on the cylinder heads, haven't taken the valves out
 yet but they look good so far.  I'll have more questions when I
 get those apart.  &gt;&gt;
They always look good until you lose a valve and destroy a head and piston.
If you do not know how many miles and/or how it was driven have the heads
rebuilt.

PS The american version of the bus came with 1500cc at the start of 1964
production.  Unless you are only going to drive your truck in town at 50MPH or
less.  You might want to look at rebuilding a 1600cc engine to look stock and
modify the tranny to do lower RPMs at higher speeds.  Especially since you
live in Arizonia were the last time we where there the folks on the highways
were doing 80-90MPH instead of the posted 70MPH.  At 54MPH in our 1960 panel
camper with 25&quot; dia. tires on the front and 29&quot; dia tires on the rear at
3,000RPM in fourth.  It felt like we were running down range with missiles
being shot at us.  Now with the modified tranny that has 1964-67 reduction
gear boxes (Plus changed the front suspension at the same time to keep the
brakes from 180 degreeing the bus during panic stops.), 25&quot;dia tires in front
and 27&quot; dia. tires in the rear we speed down the miles at 66MPH at 3,000RPM in
fourth gear.  If you are interested in this tranny modification we would be
glad to email it to you.  EEE&amp;B
