Subject: Spare rim color??

Hello all,

My barndoor came with a 15&quot; crows foot spare rim, dated 5/57... It is mostly
covered with rust, but I noticed the other day it still has some og black
paint on it. What bus came with black rims in 57? Was that an option?
Someone mentioned they thought spares might have been black. Anyone know
anything regarding this?
Thanks
-Wade
