&gt; As long  as I kept it below 55mph, my oil temps wouldn't reach  220.

&gt; Hi Eric,
&gt; What RPM are you doing at the speed?  What was the outside temp (even  a
&gt; guess)?  Very interesting info!

Stock big nut tranny gearing. I'm guestimating that it was about 3100 rpm.
It was summertime, about 80 to 85 degrees that day.

A large portion of oil heat actually comes from the cam/lifter friction.
Higher rpm's and/or higher spring pressures will raise oil temps
signifigantly.
