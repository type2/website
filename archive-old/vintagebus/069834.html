Subject: Re: [VB] voltage drop  - Scavenger's tip?

One thing with those type resistors is if they were in the ducting (air flow
going through them) then useing them as a volt a drop w/o them in an air
flow while being used they will burn up. The air flow keeps them cool and
helps keep them from burning up. I have changed hundreds of them in the big
rigs due to blocking the air way to the fan with the drivers belongings or
evaporators plugged with animal hair, dirt and about most anything you can
think of that restrict the air flow which causes them to overheat and then
time for a new one.
