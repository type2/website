&gt;If the hubcap can be here by Aug  I will make sure that it gets to Denver
by
&gt;for the Bandimere show and then I know that some one from Bus Heaven
&gt;(arizona)can get it further West or we could get it here by the fall and
&gt;have NQ and I take it west.  But the rate it is moving it will probably
rust
&gt;away before getting to the land of no rust


Hey yeah, I 2nd this notion.  We need to get it to St. Louis, KCMO, and then
to me.  Then I could relay it to Bandimere and send it down to some Oklahoma
or TX listees because I know some of them come up for the show...

NQ
