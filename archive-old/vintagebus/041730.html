&gt; A reserve price isn't necessarily secret.  Some sellers want it secret,

&gt; Some sellers reveal the reserve to separate the men from the boys up front.

Often, if the buyers knew the reserve price they'd say &quot;that's crazy&quot; and
not put in a bid at all.  The reserve allows the auction seller to try and
get a bidding frenzy going without actually having to risk selling an item
at a low price.  

In the old days of face-to-face auctions, sellers would
employ &quot;shills&quot; to perform the same function as the reserve. They'd bid
the item up a bit at a time until the real buyers got sucked in.  If there
was only one &quot;real&quot; bidder, the shill would bid the price up until it was
high enough to satisfy the seller.  If the &quot;real&quot; bidder followed the
shill up, they would end up paying a lot more.  If they didn't follow the
shill, the seller wouldn't have to give the item away cheaply.

For some reason, people are more likely to raise a low
bid to a higher amount than they are to simply bid the higher amount to
begin with.  Ain't human nature wonderful! :)
