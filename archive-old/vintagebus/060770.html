Subject: Anybody dealt with this guy before?

Greetings!

Has anyone dealt with Maurice Klok from Kieft en Klok in the Netherlands before? He is interested in buying my bus and while everything seems legit...it would be nice to know if anyone else has had any experience with him.

See y'all in Jerome!

thanks,
david
