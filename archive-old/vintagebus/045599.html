I went to visit a friend the other day in regards to buying some nice NOS and 
cherry parts for the 57 when we started talking about the 59 single cab a 
friend of mine has. The single cab is an early 59 which was used by GOETTLS 
air conditioning in Tempe/Mesa, AZ.  After talking for a while and explaining 
that there were others with the logos used by this company it became apparent 
that he OWNED ONE!  The bus is also a 59 and had the same logos and lettering 
on it.  So in fact this would be the long lost one that was not hurt when 
they were parked by a house which burned to the ground.  So now there are 
what seems to be 3 single cabs and 1 panel.  One single cab is toast, the 
other is RUSTY another is fine and the panel is currently being restored.

A small, strange world indeed.  Now on to find the other missing relatives!
There will be some pictures of the fleet coming up on the club site soon and 
YES I will send you them everett.  So if anyone owns or knows of any of these 
work vehicles let me know!!!
