Subject: Re: [VB] tail light grounding
To: VintageBus_at_type2_dot_com

I generally take a wire, connect it to the ground tab on the back of the 
taillight (make one if it doesnt have one) then run the wire to the screw on 
the side of the engine that holds the rear apron on.  I have done this with 
many busses and it seems to fix the problem everytime.  Wierd but works.  It 
doesnt look too intrusive either.
