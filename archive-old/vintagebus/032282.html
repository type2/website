Well, doesn't rarity play a part in car values? How many 66 Rivieras are
there? How many 66 Westfalias are there? I still say that the off-brand
camper market is going to explode once people have info about them.
Restoring a 66 Westfalia is incredibly easy as far as research goes,
there's tons of them. But, I'm struggling to find any info on my 66 EZ
Camper. Have, I've got the brochures and I've seen them at shows...but no
one REALLY seems to know the whole story.

C'mon Taylor, you're supposed to be on our side! hahah :) Although I agree
that we have no idea the condition of the car from those pics...
