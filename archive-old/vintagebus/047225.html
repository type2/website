Hi,
Do not get the Sears 3/4&quot; drive slide breaker bar.  They bend all too easily 
with just taking off the axle nut.  Not to mention when you have to take a 
rusty piece of junkyard VW suspension apart or the time you find out the last 
shop that worked on that flywheel used a air wrench set for 500+ Ft Lbs.  
Instead find your local Proto dealer and by thier 3/4&quot; drive L-shaped breaker 
bar.  Only about $10.00 more than the Sears breaker bar and will hold up to a 
eight foot cheater bar with only slight flexing.  Instead of just breaking 
with only a four foot breaker bar as the Sears breaker bar does all too 
easily.
Otherwise Sears has been a good inexpensive source for all sized/drive 
sockets and quality 3/8&quot; drive wrenches and open/close wrenches that have yet 
to fail us.
