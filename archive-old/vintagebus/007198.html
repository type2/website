&gt;Does anyone know of a good cleaner that will get the years of grime off
&gt;the glass.  It is mostly a frosty dirt material right next to where the
&gt;rubber would be that i need to remove.  These are not the front window's
&gt;so i know it is not the laminate frost you can get.  this is years of
&gt;dirt/gunk that does not want to come off.


One thing I've found really works, a tube of blue abrasive stuff from
Walmart.  Unfortunately they don't carry it at all stores, but just 2 weeks
ago I bought a tube in TX while on vacation that was &quot;clearanced&quot;  Check it
out at your local store, in a big toothpaste tube near the wipers if they
have it but I can't find it right now to give a name.  Stuff works
incredible at removing diesel deposits and all the other stuff that make
wipers not work.  It is only very mildly abrasive, by hand you could never
scratch glass with it.  Single sided razors are nice as well but you got to
be carefull cause if they catch a nick and get nicked then they can scratch.

On an aside that I'll mention, the Eastwood glass polishing kit is useless,
utterly despite what they claim will not even remove the lightest haze.  BUT
my dad has some jewelers polish of some unidentified sort he got years ago
&gt;from a hobbiest jeweler friend and using the Eastwood mandrel and buff I've
sucessfully polished VERY deep scratches out of windshields.  So deep in
fact that when polished you notice them bending the light, much deeper than
&quot;catch you fingernail deep&quot;.  Light road haze scratches from underneath
wiper blades dissapear completly.  Unfortunately I have no idea what, or how
fine (very) the stuff is.
