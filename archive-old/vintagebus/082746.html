Subject: Re: [BP] EB2005 Trip Report

Greg,

Excellent trip report as always. I especially like the Cake quotes. I 
was blaring Nugget from the iPod at Registration at some point so it 
was really neat to see the quotes on you report page.

I have linked you page to the EveryBus History page

http://www.mindspring_dot_com/~everybus/History.html

along with the gathering pics and stories. Everyone have a look and if 
you have something to contribute, let me know. I can even host some 
pics if you don't have the web space.

Thanks
Chris
RED CUP!!

&gt; Hi Volks,
&gt;
&gt; It took six days to live the adventure, and 5 days afterwards to find
&gt; time to write about it.
&gt;
&gt; I've posted it on the interweb because it's just a little too long for
&gt; email,  and because with html formatting I can put some pictures online
&gt; to go with it.
&gt;
&gt; Here's the link:
