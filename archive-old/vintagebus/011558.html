     Okay folks, Saturday is the Central Ohio Vintage Volkswagen Club's 
8th annual VolksFest, the largest VW show in Ohio, and one hell of a bus 
show.  Last year we had well over 200 cars showing and at least 40 or so 
were nice busses.
     
     Features include:
     
     No bikini contest!

     Participant judging!

     Lots of swap!

     Standard pre-show campout!

     Proceeds go to charity!

     New class this year:  late bus has been split into late bus and late 
camper.  My dad, who's won late bus the last two years would like to see 
some nice-looking loafs to &quot;make him look good&quot; (his words)

     If UPS actually manages to deliver it tomorrow, I'll have my brand, 
new SA grille on my 85, *and* this will be my three-month-old son's first 
VW show.

     Details, including a map, and times are to be found at 
http://www.fpi-prostar_dot_com/covvc/

     And, if you don't make it, I'll have pictures in the next week or so 
at http://home.columbus.rr_dot_com/oshome/vw/  (and if you want, you can go 
there now to see some pix from last year, including Mark Keller's salvage 
title 91 Carat, Charlie Ford's Mothership, and the most horrible thing 
ever done to a split crewcab.

     I'll see ya there.
