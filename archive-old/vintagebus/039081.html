Subject: Cost of rebuilds!
Date: Wed, 14 Oct 1998 09:15:20 -0500

&gt;But before you do anything at all you should understand that
&gt;a proper overhaul will probably cost about a thousand dollars for 
&gt;parts and machine work and will take... as long as it takes.  You 
&gt;must then justify that time/cost against the fact you can buy a 
&gt;brand-new, factory-built 1600cc engine for about the same amount.

Hi Bob, good to hear from you again!  I just wanted to pipe in with my
&quot;me too&quot; on this one.  

I decided to rebuild the 1600 in my 58 single cab this summer.  My goal
was to have an engine dependable enough for long trips and one that
would last me 50-60k miles.  I told my wife (and myself) that the
rebuild could be done for around $300 and I'd have a great, fresh
engine.  

That estimate soon doubled to $600 as I began dismantling things and
discovering more and more parts that needed replacing or machining.
When I finally placed my order to the parts shop, my cost was nearly
$900.  Add to that the machining costs and misc. other things I've
needed and my 'new' 1776 engine has cost me close to $1300!!

Now, I like to think I've got an engine that will give me a lot of
trouble-free use and enjoyment, but the cost?  Well, I suppose it's
worth it in the long run.  But the process has been wrought with
frustration and set-backs.  Damn near everything I did on the engine
uncovered yet another problem that needed to be dealt with.  Now I've
got as much money in the engine as I paid for the truck in the first
place!

And now that I'm ready to put the engine back in (for the second time I
might add), I still don't know if it will live up to my expectations.
Or even if it will live long enough to get me to the store and back.  So
I guess what I'm getting at is don't approach a complete rebuild with a
light pocketbook and lots of optimism - it just won't get you as far as
you want to go.
