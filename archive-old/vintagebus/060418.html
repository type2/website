Subject: Help With Cylinder Heads

------=_NextPart_000_0189_01C23D86.779D3A60
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

So I pulled my cylinder heads and, unbelievably, one side has long studs =
and one side has short studs. Muir talks of this. One side is 113 101 =
371 A (33) and the other is 113 101 373 (49).  The side with the long =
studs is the side with the bad studs.  I went to the recommended local =
machine shop and the guy there said that I could probably just order =
new/rebuilt cylinder heads for less than it would cost to get mine =
rebuilt.  He also said that he didn't think he could get the kit that =
was available to convert the long studs into the short studs. How hard =
can that be? Anyway, =20

With 40 hp cylinder heads with larger P &amp; C's is there any machining to =
do on the heads?  That is, if I just get new ones will they have to be =
altered to fit my large bore cylinders?

Where can I get 40 hp cylinder heads? =20

Does anyone know who can rebuild these around Ont? =20

So each side has a different part number (see above) what's the deal on =
that - I suppose there are other part numbers that will also work?

TIA
