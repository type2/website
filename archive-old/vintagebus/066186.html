Subject: Re: [VB] Welding trouble

My tip is &quot;frying bacon&quot;.  If the welder does not sound like you are frying 
bacon when you are welding a bead then it is not set right.

Also I think lots of people do not get the welder hot enough.  Even if you 
have it set on ultra low you can burn through if you sit on a spot too long. 
  You need to get the metal hot to properly join/fuse it.

Work the puddle.  Once the metal is tacked in on the edges or whereever then 
start a puddle and go baby go.  Use a circular wand technique and just run 
the bead as fast as you can.  Personally I do not buy this one or two inches 
at a time philosophy.

The real trick is having clean metal to make the weld.  It makes all the 
difference in the world.

I started slowly, but once you get the touch... It is addictive!  Now on to 
building trailers and such :)

Good Luck,
Adrian
