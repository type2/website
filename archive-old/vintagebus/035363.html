  &gt; The model year change over date varied from year to year with the exception 
  &gt; it remaining fairly constant from 1965-67. 
  &gt; For example, I have official VW documentation that supports that bus 
  &gt; production for the 1959 model year began in November 1, 1958 with 
  &gt; chassis # 404 491.  The same documentation states that the 1960 bus
  &gt; model year began in September 30, 1959 with chassis # 514 885.
 
  
..  wow- that is interesting.  wonder why they would jump around with when the model year started.   You know, I had the vague impression that the model year would start in Septemeber, but them some thing would say august, though I never worried about it much, so I guess this explains it, that it wasn't consistant.  Thanks for figuring this stuff out.
