Subject: Re: [VB] Alternator light

Double check a few times before running a new wire.  FWIW, I have never had 
to run a new wire.    You removed the dash bulb and checked to make sure the 
bulb was good by using some alligator clips and getting electricity from the 
fuse box or whereever? put bulb back in place?   Checked for crACKS  in green 
wire to gen in engine compartment?  Does the oil light work?   IF neither oil 
nor gen light work you may not have power to the speedo, which means 
grounding that green wire would not ground the circuit, as no electricity was 
fed into it.

&lt;&lt; OK, so I've grounded the wire and nothing happens.  I've checked the
 connectors on both ends and they are good.  At this point do I have to run a
 new wire from the engine to the dash?

 &gt;I don't think I can follow the same procedures as for a generator 
 &gt;with seperate regulator (i.e. grounding the wire to see if the
 &gt;light comes on...if so, bad regulator or its ground).
 
 The warning light wiring is exactly the same.  So, pull the warning
 light wire off of the alternator, ground it, and turn the key on.
 If the light comes on, the trouble is in your alternator; if the
 light doesn't come on you have a burned-out bulb or a bad wire
 somewhere.
