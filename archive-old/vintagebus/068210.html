Subject: Re: [VB] upper  engine bolt.  aaargh (fwd)

Hehe! It's glue-the-bolts-in-night here at home! ;-)

I've got the doghouse, and thin fingers, so it has always worked out fine
for me. It seems to me that there's sufficient room for larger fingers as
well, and the ratcheting wrench gets in there just fine too. If you're
innerested in my glue the bolts in procedure, I just wrote it up (again)
for Bob, and can forward it to yah if you like. My first engine in the 67
didnt have the insert, way back in 73, so it was no contest as to how I
was going to make my life easier when it came time for engine r and r's.

But everyone's got their own ways, which is fine. I'm extremely
enthusiastic about my way, cause it's made engine r and r's really quick
and easy, for decades.  The main thing I wanted to avoid is that reaching
up into that dark, greasy hell up there with the bolt and a tool, but I
can see the straightforwardness of it for some.

By the way, I keep a bunch of spare nuts around in case I drop one into
front-of-engine-bottomless pit while finger-threading them on. I recover
them next time engine's out!

&gt; iffen it has the doghouse cooler, it can be a mother to get a nut in there.
&gt; Its probably worth the time to drop the engine and JB weld a nut on the
&gt; backside of the case. I did this on the type 3 conversion I just did, took
&gt; one look at the missing insert and said no way to that, JB welded a nut to
&gt; the case, snugged it down with a bolt, and let it dry overnight, instant
&gt; case insert. Now it'll take a minute to get that bolt back in.
