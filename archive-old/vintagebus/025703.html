Subject: Re: Making your Westy Ice Box More Efficient
Message-ID: &lt;378C9577.275E08B1_at_vwrestorations_dot_com&gt;

&quot;This topic of ice chests and such for Westy's came up a year or so ago
and
the general concensus then was that the ice block in a &quot;chest&quot; that has
the
door on the side will cool marginal at best.&quot;

I have found that if you go to a RV store you can pick up a very small
fan that runs on 2 &quot;D&quot; batteries forever. You put it in the bottom of
your ice box and it will keep the air circulating really well. That in
turn will keep all the food in the ice box at the same temperature. No
longer do you have to keep all the beer right on top of the ice block to
keep it cold. Jason Bizzare told me about this fan years ago and I
wouldn't be caught camping without it. It really makes the ice box work
perfectly.
