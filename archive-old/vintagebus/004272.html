Subject: Urgent help needed for my 67 bus.

In order to make to Kansas City this weekend, I'm going to need some help
from someone.  I'll gladly pay promptly here's the situation.

I'm having the overheating problems from the freeway flyer tranny which I
sort of expected.  C.R. Sauls, a kind list member, told me about Bernie
Bergmann's solution to the problem is to run &quot;Porsche&quot; pulley on the
generator.  The pulley is smaller and increases the air flowing over the
engine at any given speed.  A call to Bernie confirmed this.  He said your
cooling problems will be solved with a deep sump and Porsche pulley.  Then
he dropped the bombshell and said something along the lines of taking a
couple days to order it and then shipping it UPS ground blah blah blah.

First off, I have a deep sump which I can install tonight, but as for the
Porsche pulley, I'm not sure exactly what it's off from - I'm assuming a 356
but I don't know.

What I'm desperately hoping for is that some listee will know what it is I
need and be able to locate me one from a Porsche junkyard, parts supply
house, etc. and then be able to get the part and send it to me or at least
tell me where this part is in stock so I can order it and have it here
pronto!  I only have tonight, Tuesday, and Wednesday to get the bus in
running shape for the show and I'm dangerously close to not being able to
make the trip.

If anyone can jump in here and save my weekend, I'll definitely make it
right with you in the financial end because I'm desperate.

My alternative is to go anyway and nurse the bus around in 3rd gear or to
take the bug.  I was really hoping the bus could be taken.

If anyone can help me out, please email me with a phone number and I'll more
than gladly call so I can get the ball rolling on this conversion.
