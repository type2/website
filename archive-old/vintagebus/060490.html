&gt; I'm just wondering if anyone has any advice on things the rebuild guy might 
&gt; need to know, as he's not familiar with old vw's at all.  

Hi Diana,
Uh oh!  First big problem is that your friend has not done any VWs before.  
Every tranny rebuilder we have met whether they were praticing or long 
retired say the same thing &quot;You really need to do at least one tranny rebuild 
a week to keep up the skill level!&quot;.  Many of the interior tranny parts were 
modified and a letter suffix added to the nine digit part number to show the 
change.  VW did not stamp part numbers on many of  the interior parts of the 
tranny center section so one has to be knowlegable enough to identify by eye 
which parts will fit with which other modified parts in the tranny or risk 
failure soon after!  On top of this all your friend will have to spend alot 
of time making special tools to work on the VW tranny center section or spend 
about $1000.00 in tools if he can find them.
  Just get the VW bus shop manual for 1963-67 and check out all the 
modifications listed in the tranny section, and that does not cover all the 
modifications done since the 1960s to the replacement tranny parts!
