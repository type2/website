Gene,

    I have a very serious complaint to file!   *&amp;%#_at_%$#    Egor and I have
been working long hours in a damp laboratory, putting up with bats, spiders,
mirrors, wooden stakes, peasants with various farm implements. Not to
mention the infernal sun rising from behind a cloud without warning, lack of
a lighting storm when needed. Just to have someone steal our Galactic Proton
De-Atomizer, with the Intersteller Radium Sub-partical Death Ray Refractory
Magnatronizer Fixture, FLUX-CAPACIATOR. Driven by a secret issue one piece,
no moving parts, carbolic 36 horsepower innercooled, bosch' six volt, &quot;Beam
me up Scotty&quot; power plant.
    Now I think you must agree with me that this most secret system should
by all means stay under CIA control. Just think if it were to fall in the
wrong hands. A woman driving to the hairdresser, on a cell phone, looking in
the mirror, fixing her make-up, fighting with five or six kids and a dog in
the back, plowing into the back of some red necks Ford pick -up, knocking
his 2347 mm high velocity deer rifle out of the window rack, braking the
glass that said &quot;Joe Bob&quot; on one side and several names marked out on the
other, making his last keg of  &quot;Billy Beer&quot; go flat bouncing around the five
extra flat tires in the truck bed, and busting one of his glasspac mufflers
off, spliting his lip on the one front tooth with the CB mike. I implore
you, keep your sense'es, don't ever speak of this again!
    Just fix the stock heater right, and dress to enjoy the ride!!!

Yours truly,

Master and Egor
