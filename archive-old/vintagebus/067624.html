&gt; &gt; Is this info posted on a website somewhere? Who called the Bus a station

&gt; VW called the loaf passenger busses a &quot;Station Wagon&quot;.
&gt; I just pretend Ive never heard it before :)

More specifically, all the loaf passenger buses delivered to the US
(AFAIK) were &quot;Deluxe Station Wagons&quot; with all that nifty trim.

I once heard a splitty guy get all bent out of shape when he heard someone
refer to my '71 Deluxe SW as a &quot;microbus.&quot;  Apparently, the terminology
was important to him!
