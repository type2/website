Just picked up Pressed Bumper repo's. These are for 58 and earlier buses and
are made out of fiberglass. There should/will be pictures up on VW Planet
now or soon. Available now are front and rears (in stock) with truck ones
coming soon. Call or E-mail for price. Also 2 new items just out Washer
bottle pumps, these will sell for 12 to 15 dollars a piece and license light
boots.

I had a very long weekend, Left Havasu Friday and went to Rancho
Transmission to talk over things with Sam, looked at there core bank etc.
(they are running out of RGB and axles) last year they had hundreds, not so
today.
Saw 2 complete RGB box trannys ready to ship to some other bus owners
(outright). Talked a lot about gear ratios verses power etc and will be
coming up with a chart for gear ratios, tire size and engine size, this will
be able to help you decide which trans would be best for your specific
combination in your bus. Learning to love my trans (3.88 r/p, 77 4th, big
nut rib) cursing at 75 mph on these 700 trips makes life nice, nothing to
see cruising in the dark anyway.

SOTO/WW show was a great social event, I even won a raffle prize of cargo
door seals and front door seals, I am going to install these in one of my
buses to see how they compare and hold up to WCM seals. I did notice that on
the front door seal that they are all the same profile and the same material
as the cargo door seals, will let you know how they work.

Pomona was the worst I have ever been to it was a buyers market, everybody I
talked to (seller) also said the same, but o-well, not very many bus parts
there anyway, but a lot of buses for sale in the parking lot, especially
deluxes.
