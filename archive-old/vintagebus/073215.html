Subject: RE: [VB] cell phones cross country

Also, it's fun to listen to the truckers talk about
you.  Once in northern New Mexico one trucker asked
another if he thought my singlewheel trailer was full
of &quot;mary-juana&quot;!

But really I've had pretty good luck talking to
truckers with the CB, and if one is too much of a jerk
to help you, the next one might.  Cell phone do have
limited coverage.

JP
&gt; You can talk to all the truckers &quot;good buddy&quot; and
&gt; listen to them all cus you
&gt; out, &quot;that dam slow bus I almost hit going up that
&gt; long grade&quot;. At least
&gt; you'll know when to get out of the way with a CB.
