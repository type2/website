Subject: Re: [VB] 67 master cylinder/do I have to buy a new one?

Gene,

They used to make this rebuild kit, but to the best of my knowledge, and I
have asked recently at NAPA, where it was sold, it is no longer made. It
consisted of new rubbers, and new small parts. Perhaps, check the
condition of your existing rubber carefully - are the edges still smooth,
do they fit firmly? Check the bore for corrosion and clean up with fine
emory or a bore-cleaner tool. If the rubbers fit well and aren't crushed,
they should work.
