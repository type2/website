Subject: Re: Jerome... Dogs? Please, no! 

In my last post I wrote:

&quot;Common sense. Accountability for self in general and leave the dogs with Mom
or
at a kennel. Your rabid &quot;bad assed&quot; penile compensating Pit bulls and Rotties
do not mix well with strangers and other peoples' kids.
Leave the drugs at home or duh- perhaps don't do them and save your brain for
the years in which you will need it.
Drive safely, remember that it is *SUPPOSED* to be a family oriented club with
a desire to raise money for one or more charitible causes.&quot;

-----------------
OK fine, I expressed my opinion and THEN talked to my little Mrs.
She wanted/wants to take the three dogs. *THREE?* especially after I just
upbraided the list emasse for choice of pets, what they represent and the
audacity for bringing them to a public event. Bringing three dogs, two kids
under age 4, packing for a campout that will, for us, last less than 23 hours
and arriving late... camping away from the event.

Drugs? naw, but I could certainly make many quick jokes about my situation.
To me, &quot;family&quot; camping events are becoming less and less attactive when it
entails packing for passage of the entire Donner Party across the Rockies
rather than just grabbing a loaf of bread, a jug of Almadene, a couple of
sleeping bags and shoving the keys into the rat bus and hauling AZ.
