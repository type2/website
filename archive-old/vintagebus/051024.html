Subject: Re: [VB] What exhaust should I use?

&quot;I think that a stock bus muffler will have too much back pressure for my
1641cc. &quot;

Because a 1.6L motor is massive!  ROTFLMAO  

What carb(s) are you running?  The major limitation is the intake stuff from
my experiences and not the exhaust.  

I have to recommend a stock setup for a small 1641.  Look at the puny intake
and exhaust on the 1.6L Civics, small is okay for small engines.
