Kyle, Thom, others:
on this subject-------------

I'll probably leave the whole subject at what you guys said. We've been
discussing it for far too long. There are better things we can talk about. I
just want to point out here that there are people on this list that are very
attached to the brand. I've met at least a few that said they drive nothing
but VW. Is it bad? I don't know. It's their choice.

I've driven so many cars in my life that I can't even remember now. I said
before that my other craze is off roading and that I own a built up Ford
Explorer which by the way I also use to tow my busses with. I said also that
VW is using all this just to spruce up their sales, that's all. To answer
another thing I have to say that I don't buy new cars. I don't say that I
stay away from financing (I need a tax write off) but never do I buy new
ones. Loose too much money this way. Man, I'm all confused, can we talk
about something else now? Let's talk about my 1600cc engine I'm building
now. How do I check the case to make sure it's good enough for a rebuilt?
Let's see if anybody got to the end of this message.


Later

Andre
