Subject: Re: [VB] Excuse me

right on, you dont see &quot;hippie types&quot; bashing you NRA supporting,
gun-slinging facists here on the list for what you believe in.  i agree,
lets just stick with the bus topic, that way we can all get along and agree
on something, right?  i joined this BUS discussion list to gain knowledge
about my vintage vw, not to be insulted and have some insecure, narrow
minded jerk(s) try and put me and others down.  hopefully this negativity
fades soon so i can enjoy the list.

Subject: [VB] Excuse me


&gt; Just a general orientation, folks. I've been reading this list only a
short
&gt; while. Is there some bias on the &quot;hippie&quot; thing? I'm serious. I am all for
&gt; any and all VW bus owners restoring their buses. But I note this
reoccurring
&gt; weird atmosphere: there's &quot;stupid hippies&quot; and &quot;professional intelligent
&gt; rich arrogant pricks.&quot;
&gt;
&gt; Given those extremes, someone would probably call me &quot;a hippie&quot; as if it
&gt; were some epithet -- except I'm old enough to actually have lived the
&gt; experience beyond the stupid stereotypes of the mass stereotypes or the
&gt; sometimes misinformed attitudes of younger generations in the entire
&gt; anti-philosophy of &quot;being&quot; a hippie.
&gt;
&gt; (Historical note for those who weren't there: we burried the &quot;hippie,&quot; a
&gt; mass media moniker, in San Francisco, in 1967. I excuse those who weren't
&gt; alive, but at the same time I indict popular culture and the mass media.)
It
&gt; was great street theater -- another foreign term -- but something that all
&gt; should get.)
&gt;
&gt; Thus, I would take offense only at the frame of mind; I'd still drive my
&gt; bus, which is what I thought this newsgroup was all about. Don't trash
&gt; people you don't even know. Let's just discuss VW's.What's so bad about
&gt; that?
&gt;
&gt; Again, I'm just asking generally. No one's going to listen to me, I
accept.
&gt; I just wanted to post to you all something more germane to the subject  (I
&gt; can see it now... the &quot;officious asshole that I am...&quot;) that attempts to
&gt; remind its users that the subject is merely our mutual fascination with
&gt; these great automobiles; our personal or political agendas, ranking, oh,
say
&gt; so byond secondary I'll have to get my reading glasses.
&gt;
&gt; If I had some.
&gt;
&gt; If this is not my place to say, I apologize.
&gt;
&gt; But I wanted to say it.
&gt;
&gt; Craig.
