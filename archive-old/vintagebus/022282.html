Thanks to Josh and RVB for the EZ scans. The greatest mystery to me has
been solved. Who in the hell put those big ass truck mirrors on that Bus. 
	From what I can tell, my 65 is an EZ. I don't have a Sundial tag. My tent
has the exact pattern as the one in the brochure. Most of the Sundials I've
seen haven't had the wide two color stripe pattern. The interior appears to
be an exact match. My cabnet mirror isn't quite the same. I don't have
those outside mirrors either. But someone did cut off the original mirrors
and mounted other odd ball mirrors to both doors. 
 	Sooooo I guess there are quite a lot of EZ campers out there. Bill
Bowman, I think your &quot;Flood Bus&quot; is defenately an EZ. His interior (what's
left of it) was supposed to be itentical to mine. Same color material on
the seats. But his has those big_at_ss mirrors on the doors. His is also 66.
What year is the literature from, 66 maybe?
	This new revelation may also solve another problem for me. I have never
named my Bus (or any other vehicle for that matter, piece of s_at_#t doesn't
count). Since I do believe I have an EZ Camper maybe I should name her
after that girl from the 11th grade.

65 EZ Camper  Woohoo!!!
