Subject: RE: [VB] Legalities of stamping an engine case

&gt;Anyway, I'm tempted to stamp the case with the original serial number an=
d
a few people have told me this is highly illegal(!)
&gt;
I don't see why it would be illegal.  Immoral, yes, if you were to sell
the vehicle and claim it was the &quot;original engine&quot;.

Legal... illegal... morality... these are all frames of mind.
