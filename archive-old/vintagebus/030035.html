Subject: Vent wing rubber....

Hello,
   I was wondering if anyone could inform me which way to install my
vent wing rubber strip.  It is the straight strip that goes in the back
that the actual glass comes into contact with when it is shut.  It is
about a foot long.  Do the 2 or 3 little lips go to the outside(contact
with the glass itself) or does the rounded off side go to the outside
and connect with the glass?  Thanks!  Oh yeah.  Are rear hatches
adjustable?  How about engine lids?  They don't look like it.   Thanks,
thanks.,  --JD
