Subject: Re: Newer Beetle speedo in early bus?

&gt;Would it be possible to use a later speedo in an early bus?

Maybe.  It seems to me like the late Beetle speedos are a larger diameter
than Bus ones, but I haven't had one of each in my hand at the same time
to compare.

As far as calibration goes, I think most air-cooled VW speedometers are
made to be directly driven by the left front wheel.  You'd need to find
the stock late Beetle tire size and compare it to the tire size you're
using with a calculator like http://www.miata_dot_net/garage/tirecalc.html .

I don't think the fuel gauges are compatible, so you'd need to blank off
the fuel gauge hole on the Beetle speedo.  A piece of sheet metal, some
flat black paint, and a bit of glue or tape would probably do it.

All the warning and illumination lights should hook up the same way.
Late Beetle speedometers have some extra lights for transmission
temperature, heated backglass, etc, that are normally sealed off with
black plastic plugs.  You could use some of these as extra indicator
lights if you wanted.

Another option might be to find a 100 km/h Bus speedo and send it to
Palo Alto or similar to be recalibrated for mph.  You get the stock
look and fit, but have more range.
