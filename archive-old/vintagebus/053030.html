&gt; The 28PCI with it's 21.5 venturi would be way too small for a 40HP 
&gt; 1200-1400cc engine.  Best to work with the 28PICT or a 28PICT-1 carb with 
&gt; thier 22.5 venturi for it.  

hey folks.  this twist on the thread has me wondering:  if a 28 pci isn't a good choice of carb on a 40hp engine, is a 28 pict carb a poor choice on a 1600sp?

i've got a 1600 engine with a 28 pict carb and while i've noticed no problems, maybe there's something bad happening that i'm missing.  the engine runs strong and nice and i get great gas mileage.  i haven't noticed any starving but i don't expect that i would.

cheers,
