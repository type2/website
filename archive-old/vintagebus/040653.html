Folks,

I know this notice could've come earlier, and I apologize for only nine or
ten days notice.

Some of us are going to get together and bring toys for children.  There are
a number who might not get anything if it weren't for people's generosity;
people like you.  Also, it gives us a great reason for getting together and
meeting one another.

The meeting date, time and place are:

Sunday, Dec. 12th
2:00 to 3:30
Knowlwood - Anaheim Hills

You can have a late lunch.  Knowlwood does sell beer, so if your desire,
it's there.

Knowlwood is located on Imperial Highway just off of the 91 Fwy, so it's
kind of central to OC, Long Beach and the Riverside areas.  If you are
coming the OC/Long Beach, LA areas, take Imperial off the 91 and go left.
If you are coming from the Riverside direction, take the Imperial off ramp
and go right.  In either case, Knowlwood will be on your left in about 2
blocks.

Please bring a new unwrapped toy.  Pokemon is hot for kids this year, as if
some of you didn't know, and items can be purchased at ToysRUs for as little
as $5.00.  (If you want &quot;to go big&quot; you can buy two.)

I do hope to see you there.  We are trying to start a club in So Cal for
late models and there will be some discussion around that issue.  But, since
I think any bus is a thing of beauty, and having owned a '62, I hope some of
you &quot;vintage folk&quot; might consider attending.

A big thank you to H. Steven and Thom for letting me post this notice on
Thursday.  I appreciate your spirit of helpfulness and having the heart of
the Season.

I do hope to see some you at Knowlwood on the afternoon of Sunday, Dec.
12th.

Take care,
Phil Ruggiero
