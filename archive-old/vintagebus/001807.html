I have to admit that while laying under the bus there have been many a time
I couldn't remember the reason I sold my new VW to buy an old one...

The second it's done though, my memory is refreshed.  It may take a lot to
get our beloved beasts ready, but when we join the caravan and wave at other
busses on the road, and pull up at some event where everyone else has gone
through the same mixed blessing, I remember.

Case in point: while driving a rental car we picked up for my father-in-law
inbound from Montana, I thought I was going to suffocate.  The GM products
was supposed to be midsized, but the only thing bigger than Gretchen was the
wheelbase.  The car was cramped, we hit a fast food joint and had a horrible
time eating, and worse, I felt like a hypocrite waving at a beautiful Type
II passing in the other lane.  I'm sure they were wondering, &quot;What the...&quot;

No....  I may have to adjust my valves all the time and deal with cold
winters, hot summers, and fixing something every other week, but nothing
compares to the classic quality of the ol' Transporter.

Nothing like seeing the world split down the middle, with a painted metal
dash, nice big steering wheel, chrome hinges of the safaris, and seeing
every inch of road before you.

Amen.
