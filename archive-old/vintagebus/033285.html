Subject: Mystery Binz
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

To date I have been able to locate and get ID numbers from 12 Binz crew cabs. 
 In searching the Internet I have been able to find what I believe are 9 
others.  If possible I need some help from the T2 list to get me in contact 
with the owners of these other 9 Binz (or any others out there.)  Pictures of 
these other 9 can be found on the VW Planet, Dropgates, and on Thom's site.  
I have named them as below...maybe that will help you know what I am talking 
about.  All information will be kept confidential, I'm just trying to track 
down all the remaining Binz out there.
