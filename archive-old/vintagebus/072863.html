Subject: Re: [VB] Brake problem ??

Sounds like you need to bleed it.  Heck, why not flush the whole system,
till 
nice clean fluid comes out at each wheel.  
---------------------- Clip ----------------------------
If I were you.
I'd pull all four wheels and inspect the brake adjusters and be sure that
the round locks that hold the brake cylinder pistons are holding the
pistons off and not letting then return entirely into the cylinder.
Confusing I know but if you see one you'll understand.
Adjust all brake shoes with the drums off and then just tweak them after
you've got them back on.
There is always a chance that you may also have bad lines that are
fractured on the inner line and are just ballooning when you hit your
brakes because the outer rubber hose isn't leaking yet.
Old busses have strange problems so don't trust anything.
