Subject: Gas Heater

Today I went and looked at a 61 panel - very complete - for $150 cdn -
it had a heater installed under the drivers seat.  had both bumpers
etc...

Anyway, the guy also had a few other gas heaters kicking around - he
offered me one for $50 cdn and it looked very nice but ..... how do i
tell if it is complete?  I guess i'll go back tomorrow and get it but i
would sure like to know if it is all there. Anyone have any ideas.

TIA
