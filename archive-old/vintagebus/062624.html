Subject: Re: [T2] tent storage

     I agree with Jan.  Tent care is ongoing and should be much like what 
you do with it every time you put it away.  Try to keep it clean and free of 
leaves inside and out.  NEVER put away an even slightly damp tent for 
storage or it will mildew very quickly.  If it's raining when you break 
camp, set your tent back up as soon as possible when you get home to let it 
air out and dry before you roll it up again.  In this case, putting it up 
for extended storage, it should be bone dry and rolled or packed extra 
tightly and carefully.  I have also known some folks to wrap it in plastic 
or put it in a plastic bag and throw in a good sized bag of that silica gel 
stuff to pull out moisture, though I have never bothered.  Storing it 
somewhere dry is best, not in a damp basement.  I own several canvas tents 
myself, and used to work at a BSA camp where we used several hundreds canvas 
tents. Canvas is very sturdy.
