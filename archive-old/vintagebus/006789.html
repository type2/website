you need the rear tin piece, for the doghouse cooler, this is a 71 only bus
part, also I will be converting some of the new longblocks to single ports
for those that want a brand new single port, useing OEM single port heads.

What started out as a simple replacement of
the pilot bearing in my 1970 bus has turned 
into my choice of

a) engine rebuild
b) new engine

This is due to the discovery of two significant 
cracks in the engine block and a bad crankshaft 
bearing. I have not torn it down, but I am willing
to bet that it needs a total rebuild. 

I am leaning toward option b, Mexican longblock, 
ala Ronnie.

The question is, how well will the engine tin and
other components fit? My dead engine is a 1600 SP 
with the non-doghouse oil cooler. The new longblock 
is a 1600 DP with doghouse oil cooler.

I know I will have to get an oil cooler stand, fan 
shroud, and intake manifold. Will there be anything 
else?
