&gt;what colour scheme would be &quot;blue and white&quot; on a 64' was this

available

&gt;

&gt;Sea Blue &amp; Blue White

&gt;

&gt;if blue and white was available what would colour would the original

&gt;interior be?

&gt;

&gt;Mesh Grey

In '64, wouldn't this have been blue white over turquoise with Como

Green interior? My bus is a '65 and it's sea blue/blue white, but

these colors weren't offered in '64, if it's actually a '64 and not a

'65 model BUILT in '64. Guess it would depend on the chassis #, huh?

I would have to agree with Micheele here.  The two tones schemes available mar
61 through jly 64 (ch # 749 001 up to 1 328 871 ) were
 turquoise/blue white, mouse grey.pearl white, and sealing wax red/beife grey.
The turquoise is generally described as a light green rather than a blue.

THe 65  (aug 64 to july 65, ch 225 001 to 225 190 000) were
sea blue/bluw white, velvet green/blue white, and sealing wax red/beige grey.
All 65s came with mesh grey upholstery, all passenger models withmesh grey
interior panels.
