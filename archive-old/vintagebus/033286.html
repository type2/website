&lt;&lt; Gives a WHOLE new meaning to VW67MANIA.  It would have to be to continue 
to drive
 that.  Dan, want me to warm up the welder? &gt;&gt;

hehe. Thats ok.  The bus is sleeping for now.  Tomorrow night I have a local 
body guru guy looking it over and hopefully Ill have the front end out 
tomorrow night too.

Ill take lots of pics of the repair for everyone.

The crack I guess originated from a POs accident along time ago.  Had a bend 
in the rail there that ended up cracking due to the weak spot. Just kept 
growing and like a dummy i never did anything about it.  Serves me right!
