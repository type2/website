&gt; Other noteables are a mention of Glen Swanson, and a colour pic containing
&gt; his beautiful 61 grgreen bus.

Hi Damon, it sounds like you're trying to convince yourself to go for the
L346 and L347 colour combination afterall. Do it ,you won't regret it.

By the way, the photos and story in SSVC on BC were great. I'll have to call
Henrik and Tonny to show them that their busses made it as well.
