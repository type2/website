See the trails and tribulations of our trip as it happens (or when I post
it)   Now if I break down just outside of Omaha the site may just disappear
and no updates will follow.  Keep your fingers crossed
1 week till we are on the road.  If you see us on the road stop and talk or
have someone flash us(preferably female of age) as this is our
Californicxation tour
