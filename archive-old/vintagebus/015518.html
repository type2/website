The POR15 won't stick very well to painted surfaces, in much the same 
way that new paint  won't stick very well if you don't sand the
old stuff.

You *can* paint over POR-15, but you have to lay down some primer on
the POR-15 before it drives.  If you lay down too much POR, it
will crack whenit dries.  I treated the roof gutters in the '55 this
way; painted on the POR-15, let it dry 15-20 minutes, then used 
rattle-can primer.  Then the normal paint can stick to the primer.


Putting POR-15 over the existing paint on your frames is a waste.
