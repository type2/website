&gt; I got an afterm arket coil from autozone and it's marked with + and -.  I 
&gt; forget is 15 + and 1 -?

Hi Bart,
This is the way we remember this, 15 is positive and on later models has 
multiple wires going to and from it (Backup lights, idle shut off valve, auto 
choke, etc...), while 1 is the negative and only has one wire going to the 
points in the distributor!
