&gt;Hey Andrew, if folks mail to you off-list, I'd be interested in hearing
&gt;what they have to say.   Auto-chokes are overrated in my opinion, but I
&gt;have yet to disconnect my auto choke on my 1600dp.    What I'd really
&gt;prefer is a manual choke...they're the cat's meow IMO.
&gt;   So when you dosconnect the choke, what sort of plugging/plumbing is
&gt;required?
&gt;

Hi Greg,
All that I did to unhook was disconnect the linkage where the throttle cable
attaches to the carb.So that if I'm lazy and don't want to sit in the bus
and wait to warm it up, i start her up and jump out and run to the back of
the bus, whip open the engine lid and manually stick er on fast idle.

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; What is everybody's view on either disconnecting the choke or leaving it
&gt; &gt; hooked up.
