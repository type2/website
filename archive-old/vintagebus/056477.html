Subject: Pitman arm removal. 66-67 wiper q-pivots/arm/linkage. Rear taillight bucket paint.

I just purchased a pitman arm puller, since I cant get a 202+a+k right
now. I see bentley wants me to remove this to pop the drag link (since
the 266h wont fit without doing this, and I hate pickle forks) MY qs
here are....Can I heat the pitman arm to reattach, since the BFH is not
recommended here, or will I embrittle an important part? Is there a
standard measurement for drag link length, or am I at trial and error
until I get the steering wheel perfect with the swing shaft at a 90 deg
angle, and the pitman in proper position? Then tie rods, of course. I
have her close now, but need steering wheel in proper position.
Trying to remove my CRAP wiper arms (non stock, no screw to hold em on
like OG), I pulled the wiper shaft out of the linkage, now only the
driver side is motivatewd, pass side just bounces around as linkage
smacks it. In 66-67, is there just a c clip to attack the pivot to
linkage? I will be redoing these soon, with new pivots (as I expect to
have to cut the wiper arms off, unless someone has some advice to work
smarter here) from Wolfsburg West, and all new seals, just want a pass
side wiper for now.
I also want to reseal my taillight buckets this weekend, any suggestions
for a paint close to the OG finish (I know, it's a plating in side the
66 housing, but mine are flaking off, and I want to clean them up for
brighter lights and protection, plus ground them to battery strap for
better operation. I also have no idea what color, I imagine a bright
silver?
Thanks,
Al
