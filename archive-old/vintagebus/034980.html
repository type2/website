Haven't you guys ever seen that old brochure with all the north american 
dealers?
Shows location, phone numbers, address, name, date opened?

&gt;I wonder if there is a record of all the VW dealers in the states and when

Kevin, funny you mention that.  Scott McWilliams and I were kicking around
that idea as part of the new Strictly Vintage 2s webpage.  What we'd have
to do, however, is collect a number of Dealers and Distributors booklets
from over the years and organize them by state, year, town, etc.  It's a
daunting task, but it is something we want to create.
