Hi Mike,
Here is some loose directions that work for any type of body welding 
replacement. 
1.  Photograph, measure, and draw the area from your bus or someone elses 
undamaged bus to get the replacement piece alinged right.  Also making a 
template from ceral box cardboard helps to make sure of curves are aligned.  
There are complete measurements of the body openings in the VW bus workshop 
manual.
2.  Cut out the rusted area in your bus to solid metal and treat all the 
rust, especially in hard to get places.
3.  Make sure to cut the replacement piece out with more material than you 
need.
4.  This allows you to cut/grind the replacement piece to fit almost exactly 
the area you need it to fit.
5. Tack weld in at a few places and check alignment and cut back out and 
realign if not right the first, second, third......time. Until you get it 
right!   Eric&amp;Barb
