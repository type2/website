NO NO NO!

. My favorite response was YO BRO if you
&gt; like it buy it! 

Anybody that uses the phrase &quot;yo bro&quot; in their conversation will be
immediately suspect in my book!  
  


Unfortunately upfront and honest people like yourself are not
necessarily the norm....especially in the bus community.  Caveat emptier!

I also think you area bit of a marked man.  We all know the &quot;players&quot;
and while you may not consider yourself one, you are well known and
people will factor that in to their negotiation and price accordingly. 
You need a front man.  Dude you're a Havasu City celeb  ;-)
