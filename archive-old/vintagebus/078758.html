Subject: &quot;funny&quot; little engine noise

My first recent rebuilding VW engine experience with about 2,000 miles on it
started to make a subtle rattle noise. I thought it was the usual noise from
the fan. I took the fan belt off and the clatter continued. What could it
be?

I pulled the engine and found the flywheel was loose! It wobbled on the end
of the crankshaft &quot;just a little&quot;.  The end play was .009&quot; with all 3 shims
installed.

I had used my old flywheel and old dowel pins. I thought it would be OK. I
carefully applied locktite to the gland nut and put all my 155 pounds on my
6 foot pipe using my new 1/2&quot; breaker bar and socket. That would have been
930 foot pounds! The gland nut was maybe 1/8 of a turn loose when I found
it. It was still hard to removed with all that locktite still on the
threads.

I found that the 4 pins in the end of the crankshaft wiggled just a little.
So I am advised that the crankshaft and flywheel needs to be replaced. I am
disappointed and hope to learn from this situation all that I can so it
won't happen again.

My plan at this point is to replace the flywheel and crankshaft. Everything
else is almost new.

Wishing I could just build an engine that would last 50,000 miles.

Any opinions, reactions, or advice is requested.

Dave
