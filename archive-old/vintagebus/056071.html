Subject: RE: [VB] tranny drain plug trick

I have found the same. Sears has a allen wrench in that size for not a
lot of money and that is what I use. I just used it yesterday to change
the tranny fluid on the 65.

&lt;&lt; ve used the same system for my drain plug after looking all over town
for
 a hex-head socket. I can't take credit for inventing it though, while
 looking for a socket to fit, I took a 17mm hex bolt to a hardware store
and
 told the guy &quot;this fits perfectly&quot; he went over to the metric nut bins
and
 took out two, screwed them on to the bolt and said &quot;here's your
answer.&quot; I
 looked at it for a couple of seconds and then the lights went on. Not
only
 is it effective, it cost a fraction of what a wrench or socket would.

not to take anything away from any body or to dampen your spirits(i have
used 
this for many situations where i didnt have the tool)for haveing thought
of 
it .

but the right 17mm allen socket is available in a number of places(by
its 
self or in sets) you could try Sears Hardware, any of the tool trucks
you see 
on the road should have it on board,or a good parts store that carries
S-K or 
Proto tools should have it.
aat least they do in my area.
but then again i somedtimes get spoiled at what i can get easily,
because of 
the area
