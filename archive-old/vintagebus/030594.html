Who/where is LaVere?  We hunted a long time for that little part.  Finally got one, but had to buy the whole (wrong) air cleaner.

There are differences.  One has straight sides and one has a notch to go around the fresh air to the heater boxes.  I think the straight side one is for stale air heater.  The notched bracket works much nicer on the later fan shroud.
