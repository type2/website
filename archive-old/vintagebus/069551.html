Subject: RE: [VB] Dealer Microfiche machine value?

I think my local dealer that just changed hands has both of these machines.
I scored all my aircooled tools from them, will try and wring these out, if
you guys want them, I have no space for these machines. I saw them though.
Will try and get info and pictures.
Must act quick the building they are in is due for destruction.

  I have the original fiche machine from PIMA VW that used to be in Tucson
and it is different then the fiche machine that I got from Chick Iverson
Porsche/VW dealer that was in Newport Beach, Cal. 1 reads the small fiche
(PIMAS) and the other reqads large fiche (Iversonn)

 ronnie

ps. still looking for the machine that reads the dealer training lp's with
the 35 mm film strips. I have over 60 of the dealer training lp/film strip
with little test booklets
