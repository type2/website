Subject: Protecting a new front emblem??

Hey!

I bought a brand new emblem for my '66 DeLuxe (Chrome) from Wolfsburg West in May 98....now the emblem is covered in surface rust, and the chrome plating is flaking off :-(  I called WW and they're going to refund the $100, but refuse to replace due to the fact I live on the coast of Florida.  I ordered another emblem from Kustom1 for $80 and it arrived today. Before I install, I would like to protect this emblem so this problem doesn't occur again.  I thought about using a high-gloss clear coat, but I'm worried that this might ruin the emblem's sheen or peel off???  I really don't have the time or $$$ to spend having extra layers of chrome added locally (a friend's suggestion).  What should I do?  Thanks for your help..

--Tom
