Subject: Snow on the bus ranch

I'm sure you all remember me bragging about our regular 100+ degree 
weather during the summer. Well today we got tons of snow here in San 
Angelo, TX. It was cold yesterday, but before that it's been fairly 
warm. Got to stay home from work. Looks like a good day to play with 
my engine rebuild in the shop. Guess I'll definatly swap out the 
J-pipes that were on there for a set of the heat boxes I've 
collected. Is there a clear cut way to tell the bus ones from the bug 
ones?

I'm lucky 'cause the property has a barn, where I keep all my &quot;busses 
in the waiting&quot; and parts. Keeps 'em out of the elements. I've got 
the prototype bus mailbox my wife made out on the street. Our place 
is commonly referred to as &quot;the bus ranch&quot;. Kinda cool.
