&gt; I believe it's a 67 split deluxe walk-thru with a late
&gt; model pop! (seller says &quot;factory installed original&quot; -
&gt; yeah right)

well...it isn't VW factory installed... but its a Dormobile pop top...and was probably
a complete Dormobile at one time ...installed by the Martin Walter?? company?    Maybe
someone installed it by themselves...hard to say with just pictures.
Actually...throw a dormo interior in it(if you can find one) and a motor...and it would
be a nice bus.  As I understand it...people could send their bus back to Dormo even
after they bought it...and have it converted... like the 59 dormo I found...i think
that was sent back after the initial purchase.  Odd that it was made out of a deluxe
though... but anything is possible?  I'd love to know the history of this one...
