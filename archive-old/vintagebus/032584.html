how does putting a larger mainjet make it run leaner?  you're going
backwards.  it'll also depend on his altitude and air correction jet size,
since on vw solex carbs, just about everything else is cast/drilled to
preset diameters/sizes.  plus, adjusting the volume control and air mixture
screws only effects the idle circuit, not anything else.
may i suggest for all to read, if you can find a copy, is a book called &quot;
SOLEX-SELECTION AND TUNING OF THE CARBURETOR &quot;  by the ARNOLT CORPORATION
(sorry to all the librarians, no other info as far as cataloging).  it's
long out of print, but is invaluable for nit-picky carb info.

&gt; I like my plugs to tell me a story with a gray burn on contact arm and
light
&gt; black on the OD of the plug base.  I do this perfectly with the 135 main.
&gt; You can do 132.5 if you want it a little leaner, but I would not advise
any
&gt; smaller.  The stock Solex jets are way too small from my experiences.
