Subject: RE: Upside-down shocks 
Date: Mon, 31 Aug 1998 11:45:42 PDT

&gt;Drilling would expose the inner working area
&gt;of the shock, rendering it useless, and drilling
&gt;into a pressurized gas container (as a shock is)
&gt;could be very dangerous.
&gt;
&gt;If you MUST run it upside down, check with the
&gt;off road shops (motorcycle &amp; truck) for covers
&gt;for shocks.  Dirt and moisture repelling for those
&gt;deep mud trips.  But then again, if you have clearance
&gt;problems, they may not work, but worth checking.

I think I need to go back and check out what the inside of the shock 
looks like.  I just assumed that since the casing was just a thin sheath 
of metal at the middle  of the shock, that that was all it was, but on 
further examination that doesn't really make sense, does it?

I think I'll check out off-road stuff and try to rig up some sort of 
system to keep water out.  Thanks for the reply.
Diana
