Subject: Cool Trick - collision repair

I taught myself a cool trick.  My '60 panel had a bent lower nose/door
frame, from some collision in it's past.  This caused the floor to buckle,
much like what happens in an earthquake, and the door didn't fit straight.

I bought two mazda scissor jacks at the junkyard.  Using the back, and
a piece of angle iron against the door frame to spread the force, pushed
the frame back out, using the steering box with a block of wood on
the top, and the frame on the bottom, as push-off points.

The door frame pushed back out beautifully!  Once the frame was back in
place, I wacked on the floor a couple of times which flattened it back 
out.  I then fit a new door onto it, which aligns perfectly, save for a
good dent in the bottom  section of the dogleg.
