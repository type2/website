 The fill plug is identical,
except it won't have a magnet in the center, and is on the side of the
transmission, (right side, if I haven't forgotten), way up where you
can't possibly get a bottle of fluid above it. I use a piece of plastic
hose on the spout and squirt it in.


The FLAPS will also have gallon jugs of gear oil with a pump included.
These work great for putting gear oil in anything.  The only trouble is they
are usually cheap gear oils.  I found a big operating temp difference in my
overdrive between using cheap oil and Valvoline HP.  Don't know why, but it
was much cooler using Valvoline of equal weight.  I usually use the cheap
oil in my old 4X4 since it spits it back out fairly fast and refill the
gallon jug with good stuff.  Your bus trans will take a little over 2.5 qts
of oil.  I think if you get three qts.  that leaves enough to do the
reduction box change but I forget.  If you can get a gallon jug with a pump
of good oil you'll be set.
