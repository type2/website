&gt;Again I can find nice expensive ones...I need CHEAP!

If your not worried too much about being &quot;correct&quot;, you may want to go to
your local W*l-M*rt and check out the trailer lights. There is a set of
small round ones that look like they'd slip in the hole for the taillight.
I'm not positive, just saw them there and happened to notice. They cost
about $5.00 or so for the set.

Another option is to find a set of the original chrome lense holders used
or something. Then buy a set of real cheap generic round red lenses and
grind them to fit. For the light housing, just find a set of lights (maybe
with the round red lense with them) and get creative about mounting them.
My '59 had a taillight housing that was some aftermarket trailer thing. You
couldn't tell unless you opened the decklid and inspected it. It worked
just fine and looked correct from the outside.

Just a few &quot;cheapo&quot; fixes from a trailer-park kinda guy!
