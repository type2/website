Yes I think I will keep the 6 volt as there are no problems.  How does
one know the mileage on a bus.  When I got my bus it had 40 thousand 
miles.  What is this actually?  The bus had tires on it that said made in
germany...   Also what is the dime sized red light for  on the dash next
to the wiper switch?    thanks jon
