&lt;&lt; I don't know why this works, but it does seem to.  A recalcitrant screw

Hi JP,
Yes, that actually works well!  If you can get the threaded fastener to move 
at least a 1/2 turn either way you break up the friction that is stopping 
it's movement.  I (Eric) was taught the same in the USAF where I spent an 
average of many hours each day removing stripped or stuck screws by using a 
speed handle.  Plus a block of material with a hole drilled in so it would 
fit the handle of the speed handle as a shoulder pad, and one can apply most 
of thier upper body wieght into the apex to prevent slippage while getting 
that first 1/2 turn.
