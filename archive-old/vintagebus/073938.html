Subject: Re: [VB] Bus Insurance -Good luck

What we are all going to see soon is a complete examination of our 
personal and public lives before we can purchase any kind of insurance.  
Then we will really pay for it.  In Atlanta, GA there is a company, 
ChoicePoint, that mines data on every aspect of our being and sells this 
to the insurance companies.  I got my home owners policy recently canned 
because ChoicePoint reported that I keep a pig in my front yard.  They 
must have mined credit card data of pig food purchases?  ChoicePoint was 
also a major player in the Bush's Florida election &quot;win&quot;.  Choicepoint  
informed the state that they could remove 96,000 voters from the roles 
because these folks were felons.  Turns out that less than 6,000 might 
have been ineligible.....  Gary Gibson
