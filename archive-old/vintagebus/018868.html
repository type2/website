Subject: Cab Door Adjustments...?
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

Aloha,
  Does anyone have any advice for adjusting their cab
door hinges?  They're impossible to get right.  The
doors seem as though they need to be moved upward and
closer to the front.  Help, it's not going too well.
Thanks, J.D.
