&lt;&lt; I offered it to a person with the correct bus... but I would have really
 gotten jipped on the deal they offered me.  &gt;&gt;

how could you get jipped? you didnt pay squat for that thing.  At $1500 you 
would have made a KILLING.
 
&lt;&lt; I know you're thinking....&quot;BUT WAIT!  You're trying to sell that for how
 much?!&quot;  but read on....&gt;&gt;

&lt;yawn&gt;
 
 &lt;&lt;All I can really say about the seat is that you guys out west will
 probably see it at some shows next year...and the 'vintage nazis' will
 cringe when they see the vehicle it will be in.  Believe me...I am NOT
 lining my pockets with this.  I'm not even
 getting money for it.&gt;&gt;

What the hell? it was just on eBay FOR SALE after you made countless posts 
about it being &quot;for trade only&quot; and not for sale and now, the same day the 
auction ended with a closing bid of $0.01 less than reserve you've already 
gotten rid of it for something other than $.  That seems pretty fishy to me.  
You're a terrible businessman...err boy too.  Bus enthusiast inst a label I'd 
give you either.
 
 &lt;&lt;So...think what you will...it doesn't bother me.
 Yes, I do consider myself a &quot;true&quot; bus enthusiast, but sometimes I need
 to make some dough too you know.  I have a 30 mile drive to school every
 day...and of course 30 miles back....in the bus.  Gas gets spendy...and
 fast.  Good thing I graduate in 7 weeks!! Wahoo!!  (actually... its
 January 11th... but only 7 more weeks of actual school)  I can't wait...&gt;&gt;

Do you want some cheese with that whine? you must not really &quot;need&quot; that 
dough since you previoulsy claimed you arent getting $ for the seat and 
turned down $2999 and $1500 for it.
 
&lt;&lt; Whats that Woody?  School?  Not next year... I'm taking a break for a
 little while...going to figure out what I really want to do.  I think I
 have an idea though.... ;-)&gt;&gt;

Why are you so vague about everything?  why cant you just say &quot;I traded it to 
a guy in so cal for ____&quot;? and why cant you say &quot; I'm going to take some time 
off from school because I think I want to do ____&quot;?
 
 &lt;&lt;Hey...you guys and gals in the PNW...watch out!  I'm headed your way!!
 In February sometime that is...&gt;&gt;

Why? I'm sure most of them would like to know/receive warning of where you're 
going and why you're going there.  If you're going to bring it up, explain 
yourself.
 
 &lt;&lt;oh yeah...I almost forgot.  The reserve was $3,000  ;-)  A good and safe
 number.  I knew it wouldn't go for that...  If you guys *really* must
 know... I was offered $1500 for it outside of ebay.  I turned it down.
 Why?  Well.... you guys/gals will have to wait a couple months to see
 why....&gt;&gt;

You're becomming dumber and dumber by the minute.  If $3000 was such a good 
safe #, why'd it go all the way up to $2999.99?  I still dont understand 
that?  Am I the only one that sees something wrong with that?  And why on 
earth would you deny an offer of $2999.99 and an offer of $1500 only to trade 
it away for something you wont talk about.  You obviously didnt help someone 
out who had the bus it fits by trading them something you need for something 
they need.

You dont make sense.  Add this fiasco to that situation where you totally 
screwed that guy out of a bus he was going to buy by swooping in and buying 
it out from under him and then turning around and trading it for something 
else just a few months later and you've become the poster boy for bad karma.  
I dread the day you make it to So Cal.
