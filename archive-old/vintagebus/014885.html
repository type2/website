Precisely.  I'd love to know why they didn't do that originally....

In any case, the next question is where to find an appropriate
shut-off valve.  I went by the &quot;has all the esoteric hardware&quot; place
today, and although I could find lots of brass plumbing fittings, they
all had plastic packing that looked like it wouldn't hold up to
gasoline (rated &quot;air, water, oil&quot;).

I'm figuring on getting two, preferably with a locking disconnect
between them, so there's no need to ever fight with pulling the hose
off of a tight-fitting barb, or anything else that's likely to stress
it.

Any suggestions?

Thanks.
