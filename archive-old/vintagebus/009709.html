My M code plate on my 62 SO34 has no export code. 
I know it was originally sold in Europe. Where 
in Europe, I-a-cannot say. How can I find out
What city and dealer it was sold at? Also, what color is 
654c exactly?? Anyone have the paint codes?
I'm thinking of repainting the outside only top and 
bottom. The paint is not *real* bad, but there are
the faint signs of rust forming under the paint in a few
spots. Nice and rusty under the rock hard door seals.
It's time to take care of it. I'm hoping to sell off one 
of the motorcycles and put a 60 gallon compressor where 
it stood. Then l can turn half the garage into a blasting booth.
Woohoo!
