According to the 1969 Without Guesswork manual, the gear ratio up to chassis
469446 in the RGBs is 1.4, whereas it is 1.39 in the rest of the 1200 range
and 1.26 in the big-nut RGBs.  The book claims to go back to December 1953
and is a dealer service manual, so I assume that includes the barndoors -- I
hope somebody will correct me if I am wrong.  I don't know much about the
early splits.  It provides info on the gear teeth if that would be helpful,
you can view it here:

&gt;
&gt; Does anyone know what the ratio is in a Barndoor Reduction box and how
that &gt; compares to the later splitty boxes?
