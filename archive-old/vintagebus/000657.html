&lt;&lt; Tryin to get the turn signals workin, truck (62) has been converted to

Hi David,
First change all of the bulbs from 6 volt to 12 volt.  Especially the 
dash/idiot/interior light bulbs!  Then install a set of resistors in front of 
the wiper motor so as to get about 6-7 volts going to the working wiper.  
Some install this before the wiper switch to allow them to hook up thier 
delux clock to the resistor for constant power to give the clock some 
reduction in voltage.  Then either change to a 12 volt starter, or our 
favorite, install a 12 volt solinoid (Found to be working on almost all dead 
12 volt starters.) on a 6 volt starter.  Install a 12 volt signal relay, and 
on 1962, or 63 and later buses a 12 volt emergancy relay box.  If you have a 
6 volt radio you will have to either resistor the voltage down (Much tricker 
than doing the wiper.  Check the archives for this.) completely seperately 
from the wiper system, or change to a later 12 volt radio.  If you use the 
electric choke you will need to install a 12 volt one.

&lt;&lt;Thanks for ALL the help youve given me.....  &gt;&gt;
Glad we could help!   Eric&amp;Barb
