Subject: Re: [VB] Top 5 Books

i don't know, it cost me $60 for my copy of a copy. i have no scanner
either. i could have more copies run (for the same price) and they get
bound in a plastic ringy thing binder. 
not that i'm in it for money, but that's a large (to me) chunk of change. i
guess i'm more of a sicko who likes to make people drool! 
anyway, there IS another listee who got a copy that may be able to submit
his copy. (no name provided to protect his safety from the literature
nazis...for now)
