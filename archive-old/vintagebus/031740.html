1776 single port, duel Kadrons, 1.25 ratio rockers.
  Easily revs to 5500 have had it to 6000
  Cruise at 75 mph at 3400 rpm
  Take first and second to 4500-4900 
  Take 3rd to 3500 usually, except when climbing hills 3000 rpm at 50 mph
  Cannot cruise in 4th under 55 mph as I am lugging the engine 
  Still working on the jetting am now at 16-17 mpg cruising at 75 mph
  Ratio rockers helped tremendously , gained 500 rpm and a lot more torque

Trans specs;  Rancho 3.88 R/P with 77 4th gear. 22% drop between all gears.
The problem is with torque, forget to figure in wind resistance at speed
when choosing the 77 4th gear. Am trying to solve this problem by building a
1800 type1/2 engine, have all the parts but not the time, 3 engines ahead of
mine.

 Engine specs; 1776(90.5 P/L) 69 stroke CW welded crank,stock flywheel,
stock rods, rebuilt, sized and balanced end to end. German single port heads
with Manley 40 mm intake and 35.5 exhaust valves. High rev springs with
chromolly retainers and keepers. (No more Gene Berg valve screws, had 1
break), SCAT 1.25 ratio rockers, 30 mm geared oil filter pump, stock
European universal heater boxes, larger pipes then stock, Thunderbird header
and muffler (to be changed with S S header with flowmaster style muffler.
Doghouse fan shroud with close finned type 3 oil cooler (almost 30% more
fins then a stock VW cooler). Do not have any gauges except Tack (V D O
street eliminator) but after a 140 mile drive starting in 100 degree heat
cursing at 75 mph I could pull my dipstick without burning my fingers, of
course my fingers are like leather.

Ronnie

ps. we are currently testing the difference on the type 1 verses the type 3
close fin cooler, should have realistic test results after this weekend.

Subject: [VB] Max RPM's updated (can't count)


I have a 1600 SP in the 70 pop_top Westy and a 40 horse in the 63 singlecab.

I sorta redline the 1600 a 4000 RPM (72 MPH with standard tyres)
18 mph/1000 rpm I read on the list.
Correlates with the owners manual saying that 65 is cruising speed &amp; Max 
speed.
I have not installed the tach in the singlecab but it has a big nut tranny, 
and 205*15 tyres. So I guess that I can probably drive at 60-65.

But the question is, 
Some people say that 3500 RPM is a good Max
I infer from the book that 4000 RPM is Max
Others have said that 4500 RPM is Max

What is the answer?
