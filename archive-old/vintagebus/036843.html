Do you think it's too lean even at high altitudes?  I've always had the
impression that carbureted engines run rich in the thin air.

Thanks,

The 34 is jetted too lean, all the way through. You need to open up the idle
jet,
accelerator pump jet, and reset the accel. pump for more flow.

And btw, get rid of the rivet, it only makes things worse.
