&gt; 3. Does anybody know the source of SO42's cabinet handles?

You can get them from GoWesty. www.gowesty_dot_com. I didn't see them on the
site, but they donated some cool stuff to the Jerome Jamboree raffle bus and
sent one of the handles along for our information and review. They looked
identical to me and were reasonably priced. They may be listed in their
catalog by now, they were not even on the market yet in September when we
saw them.
