Subject: RE: Center Pivot Bushing (55 Westy)

Paul sent a procedure for R&amp;R that looks pretty good.  On the question of
reaming
you do need a 24-27 mm adjustable reamer.  But the other thing I have
used with some success is a brake cylinder hone.  Stick it in yer drill
hone from the bottom (bottom bush first, fit pin then hone top), hone
a bit and check fit often.  Takes a bit longer but you do get a nice
fit..............

OK go for it, shoot me now 8-)..............

&gt; 8. At this point, only InterEurope mentions reaming the bushings, but
&gt; the several I've bought have been undersized. I believe this is to allow
&gt; for distortion upon installation. The fit is _critical_! Don't ask me
&gt; how I know! :) It should pivot easily by hand without slop. 
&gt; 
&gt; Okay, that's pretty vague. The specs in my &quot;Without Guesswork&quot; say to
&gt; ream out to 24.00-24.03mm (.9448-.9459in). The pivot shaft specs are
&gt; given as 23.98-23.97mm (.9440-.9436in). Wear limit on the bushing is
&gt; given as 24.04mm (.9463) and on the shaft 23.95mm (.9429in)... so don't
&gt; ream it much. You could buy the correct machinist's reamer for this... I
&gt; use an adjustable reamer. I start undersized and very, very gradually
&gt; ease it out until I get the fit I want.
