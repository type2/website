Subject: Tail-lights with LED's

Hello, folks!

I have done the LED conversion a few years ago, before the advent of
superbright LED's.

The then &quot;bright&quot; Led's were inserted in holes I had cArefully drilled in the
upper chamber ( amber ) for the flikkerlight and into the lower chamber for
the tail and stop light. ( red) All the diodes had a common and the hot end I
ran through a current limiter / stabiliser IC, as the then diodes consumed a
higher current then the new generation superbrights.
The voltage was more or less stable at 5,8 Volts DC.
I used silver paint to &quot;re-silver&quot; the bowls, and the first effort used thin
wires, which were later substituted by a home made PC Board.

As the plastic lenses were badly faded from our intense Highveld sun ( almost
6000 ft above sea level) the LED's shone nicely through and the visibility
even from an angle was good. ( After all, I had drilled the holes for the
LED's all the way from the left of each &quot;bowl&quot; to the full right....)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
----------------------

But since then, I have come accross a premanufactured cluster of LED's, going
from 6 Volts to 28 Volts operating voltage. It contains 3 clusters: The top
one for amber LED's and the bottom one for brake and taillight LED's in red.
It has the same size as the body of the original VW taillight ( bulb) holder.
I fitted it behind the metal, took out the rubberseal and re-fitted the lenses
from the outside ( just like the original).
And, boy, it looks nice!
Only thing is, this units seems to be less visible from an angle, that is, if
one stands either to the left or right of the taillight. But it's bright in
the night.

I found them at MIDAS auto spares, their HO is in Midrand.

Those LED clusters are made by Hella in New Zealand, and come in the yellow
box with wiring diagram for American and normal configuration.

Maybe you guys could check out your Hella suppliers? After all, Hella is TuV
approved...

Good luck,
MikeBee
