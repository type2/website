Subject: Re: [VB] Insulation/sound deadening

I've used that stuff before, and variations thereof.  It works OK in
terms of muffling the sound, but there are concerns about condensation.
Alternately, take a look at this stuff.  Dampesn the sound well, and
doesn't absorb water.

&gt; Anyone have suggestions on &quot;insulation&quot; for sound deadening?  Is it worth

&gt; singlecab is so quiet that they cannot hear the engine running.
