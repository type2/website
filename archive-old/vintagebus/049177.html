Hello Sam!
  I guess the procedure would be to find the rivets, find the right size hole to drill, drill them in the right place. Find a helper to hold the strips down while you climb inside to pop away.  A few concerns... If you don't get the wood down tight, you'd have to drill out the rivet and do it again. Ditto if they loosen up with warping. I'd tend to use screws, easier to tighten and redo if necessary. You might use a dab of sealant around the hole under the wood with either the screws or rivets.

Has anybody used blind Pop-rivets?
I am almost ready to install my Robert strips &amp; was going to use blind 
pop-rivets with stainless steel washers &amp; silicoone sealant.
