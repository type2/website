Subject: stainless muffler ?

hey,
i saw in the most current issue of VW Trends, in the back cover, Cal Imports 
has a stainless muffler fo $99. my bus is kinda loud and i was thinking of 
replacing the muffler. my question is... i know this muffler is for a bug, 
but will it bolt up to my bone stock 1500sp? performance? i have heater 
boxes too. or, maybe someone makes a stainless one for the bus that i dont 
know of. as much as its frowned upon by vintage nazi's, i do like the sound 
the beetle mufflers spit out.
later,
