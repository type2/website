Yeah...you're prolly right....I just get the shudders after I was reading
about loss of oil pressure, and now that I won't be using gauges....but I
suppose that all this is about putting a little trust in these things....

&gt; What you want a big oil pump for? Them extra ponies making you squeamish?

Well, my fingers are greasy, and my tools aren't lonely, but my brain is
still green.....it should become hard and pungent with age and exposure,
like a fine cheese....

. Big pumps are for newbies, you've been
&gt; around for a minute.
