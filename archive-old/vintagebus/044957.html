what that funny sound was! &gt;&gt;
Hi Gene,
Sounds like when the throw out bearing and arm were installed last the 
mechanic did not make sure the throw out bearing ended up evenly spaced side 
to side in relation to the input shaft.  Causing the throw out bearing to be 
shoved around by the clutch pressure plate till the throw out shaft arms wore 
down to the point that the bearing fell loose on the input shaft.  If your 
new throw out shaft is off a little bit you can bend the arms slightly, but 
not too much or risk ending up raising the throw out bearing out of center.  
We have had to use washers to move the throw out shaft over enough in alot of 
cases.  Also make sure that the throw out shaft you use either has pressed on 
arms that encircle the shaft at thier base or are welded with a bead around 
the base.  The most common throw out shafts have arms spot welded together 
and fail all too often at this joint.   Eric&amp;Barb
