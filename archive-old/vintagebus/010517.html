Subject: Neil across the U.S.

Had a listee stop by today at work in a 71 Bug.  The bug had Georgia plates
on it.  The guy introduced himself to me as &quot;Neil.&quot;  He emailed me back in
May about driving his bus to North Carolina to Kelly Brown's to get
restored.  He was driving back to Alaska in his beetle.  We visited for a
little bit but I wasn't going to able to extend any hospitality until noon.
He wanted to get on his way and that was that.  Had a nice visit about the
bug and the weather.  Wished I could have offered more but work had me tied
down.

Anyone remember Neil?  Was he the guy that stopped at J.P.'s back in late
May???
