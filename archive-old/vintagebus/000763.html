Going to Bug-O-Rama years ago we stopped at the Albertsons to buy some dry 
ice.  It worked good, too good. The beer froze.

I'm sure if we put some thought and planning (like don't put the beer 
directly on top of the dry ice) into it would have been better.

On the other hand, a beercicle is the good way to beat the Sacramento heat.
