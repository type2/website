&gt; I am probably going to put a bon monoxide detector in the bus, for
&gt; when I use this thing.

Good idea for any kind of combustion heat - gas heater, propane heater,
natural gas, whatever.

&gt; In retrospect, I probably should have been able to test it without
&gt; installing the engine. [...] I think you could hook the power up to
&gt; the battery directly.  And hook the fuel line up directly.

This would probably work.  I would use a fuse between the battery and
the heater.  Also, the way it sits in the Bus, the fuel tank is at the
same level or a little higher than the heater, so whatever you rig up
for a bench-test fuel tank should sit the same way.  In other words,
don't set the heater on your workbench and expect it to pump fuel up
from a jug on the floor.  It does have a fuel pump but I'm not sure
how much head it is designed to deal with.

&gt; Well I think I am all set now, let's hope for a really cold summer ;)

If you want to test it out, you could always take off to the great
white north - it's a beauty way to go...
