Was that the same panel that someone was selling as NOS at Pomona?  If so,
the fabric looked identical to the repro stuff being sold by TMI.  A fellow
list member has just done his 21 window in this stuff (which is very close
to original), and we both looked at the panel and agreed that while nice, it
was not NOS.  NOS trim maybe.
