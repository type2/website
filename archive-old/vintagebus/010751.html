Gang:

Where can someone get some good door pin at?  I mean those pins that you use
to connect the two halves of the hinges together for the driver and
passenger door?  Eric and Barb said that my side mirror on the passenger
side should just be a pin, however the pins at the hardware store don't look
right.  Any suggestion?  Favorite Dealer?
