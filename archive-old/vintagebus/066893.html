&gt;There is a lot of talk up here about mandating the use of an ethanol/gas
&gt;blend. I believe the ethanol has a habit of deteriorating the gas line
&gt;resulting in the usual nasty situation.........

Older fuel-line materials couldn't handle ethanol very well and would
indeed deteriorate much quicker when exposed to ethanol.  Allegedly,
the material now used in fuel lines can handle the ethanol better.
I agree with George; if you inspect and replace the rubber fuel lines
regularly, you should be OK.

The ethanol blends you usually get around 10 to 15% ethanol and the
rest gasoline.  Ethanol has less energy content than gasoline, so
you may notice a drop in power and/or fuel mileage when using an
ethanol blend.

Running an ethanol blend has alleged smog benefits.  It seems to me
that the fuel-injection systems in most cars since about 1985 would
simply &quot;tune out&quot; most of the effects of the ethanol.  It might work
as advertised on a carburetor such as the ones on our Buses.  I think
that the reason that ethanol/gasoline blends are often used has a lot
more to do with lobbying by large agricultural corporations, such as
ADM, than with reducing emissions.

It is possible to run an engine on nearly pure ethanol.  Usually,
a mixture of 85% ethanol and 15% gasoline is used.  I have driven
a Geo Metro that used this fuel; the fuel system was stock but the
cylinder head had been shaved at least 0.100&quot; and I think more to
increase the compression ratio.

Ethanol is not very volatile and it is very hard to start an engine
on pure ethanol in the winter, so a little gasoline is added.  The
gasoline is also there to make the mixture poisonous; otherwise
everyone would be able to buy 190+ proof liquor for $2 a gallon.
