&gt;Then how rare is a splitty double door standard or kombi ?
&gt;
I've personally seen 1 DD Kombi, heard of/seen 2 DD Standards, and 5 or 6
Deluxes.

There was also a DD Panel for sale a while back in Texas that apparently had
been dealer converted to a Kombi.  It was technically a Kombi but still had
the high-mounted vents in the rear.  The pics the guy was going to send
never arrived but he swore it had only been repainted once, and only on the
outside, and it was not any sort of hack job.  6 pop-outs, too.
Interesting...

Since &quot;rare&quot; is abused, they may not be &quot;rare&quot; but they are definitely
scarce and highly desirable, IMHO.

There's a DD Kombi in SoCal, I see it all the time but I've never seen the
owner.  Original paint and everything.  Neat!
