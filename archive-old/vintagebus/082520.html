Subject: Re: [VB] Pimp my ride

While this episode may have been good for raising awareness of how cool old 
VW's are- I was very disappointed.  That green color was hideous! Not to 
mention the ridiculousness of the clothesdryer and 40 inch plasma screen. I 
was just waiting for them to install fishtanks in the headlights. I wonder 
if perhaps they went the bondo route because they either didnt know where to 
get the body panels or didnt have time to wait for shipping on them, the 
filler decision may have also been made out of budget limitations- last time 
I was at Bestbuy (which is where they got the plasma tv) they were priced 
around 4-7k. IMHO the worst part of this whole customization was the &quot;chill&quot; 
sign that came out of the Drivers side louvres. The base for the sign 
literally blocked off almost all air intake to one side of the motor! 
Correct me if I'm wrong, but this could spell certain doom for that kids 
motor.
