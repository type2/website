I've heard these are bad in the past, but didn't retain, or never had the 
information of why exactly they where bad. My bus has one on it now, and the 
muffler needs replaced, if there's nothing wrong with them I'd like to just 
replace the muffler rather than the whole set up. Strange mounting flange 
necessitates that I use a thunderbird muffler or replace the whole deal. any 
info is appreciated
