 Regarding the wheel well scraping, a friend of mine had an 
 epsiode where the bus hit a dip _at_ freeway speeds, and one of the front
 wheels hit the top of the wheel well and locked momentarily,
 pitching the bus.  He swore off lowered buses after that.

reminds me- in my 61 when I had it back on the road after an accident where I 
was hit at circa 60mph (est) on the drivers side at the axle, bending the 
drag link, mushing the door and the dogleg and pushing in the metal under the 
seat somewhat, anyway, on the way to a VW show with it loaded to the hilt it 
would scrape that front left tire when I hit a good bump.  I had pulled the 
dogleg out a bit before, but evidently not quite right.    oh, it has a 64-65 
suspension (installed by PO), 205/75/15 tires.
