Subject: Re: [VB] I failed...

Is that one of those folding steering wheels?  Can't read German past German
1 and 2 from 27 years ago and I forgot some.  Or is it just a dented
steering wheel?

It also looks like that drivers seat goes back further than I have even seen
a bus seat move.  Is that the recliner option!!
