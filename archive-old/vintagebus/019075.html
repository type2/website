Great! We all learn something. This is the reason for
discussions. =) BTW: My xeroxed copy of the manual
doesnt have pg 10-6 but skips to 11-1 (whatever).
Pittman arm R&amp;R is on 10-4 on mine. Weird seems like
we are a page off. Didnt intend a p*ssing contest but
thought it weird that I had remembered seeing one on
the barncamper. Then again I *am* within striking
distance of Eddie VanHalen's age. Hahahahah!
