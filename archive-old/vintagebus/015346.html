Subject: Early Bus Rear Drums? ~~
Date: Fri, 25 Feb 2000 20:57:10 PST
Mime-Version: 1.0

Hey everybody:

Does anybody know if new or NOS rear brake drums are available for 1963 and 
older Buses?  I think the brakes on my Baja will need to be spruced up soon 
and I might need to replace those drums.

For those who are confused, the car has a reduction box transaxle installed 
with a John Johnson Racing No-Hop kit and therefore has Bus brakes.
