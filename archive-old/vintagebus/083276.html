Subject: Re: [VB] why so many different exhausts?

Hi,

I have been toying with the possiblity of installing a Subaru Outback
muffler on the end of my header system. The stock &quot;quiet pak&quot; mufflers are
just too noisy for me. I do however like the header look rather than the
stock muffler. Stock with the tiny tailpipe just looks a little Wimpy to me.

I have flanges welded onto the ends of my heater boxes and have a coated
header from Kimco with matching flanges. Eliminates the muffler clamp
leaking problem.

Ronnie at Old Volks seems to be working on a muffler that is supposed to fit
into the stock space, but with larger flow possiblities. Not sure where he
is with that.

Chris
