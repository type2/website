First, thanks to all those who have offered words of encouragement on both my 
unemployment and my desire to reproduce things.  It helps a bunch!  THANKS!

&lt;&lt; This definitely takes a certain kind of person w/ the right skills and 
cash for production!!! Are you thinking about working out a prototype?:)  &gt;&gt;

Second, yes, the main problem is cash.  It takes lot's of money to 
(re)produce anything with as many parts as Safari's - Left and right latches, 
glass, rubber, side and center mounting tabs, large wing nuts, latch bases, 
etc.  Even a poor quality reproduction costs a lot in tooling, to do it right 
even more.  Safaris are one of the ideas I am thinking about now.  I have 
another in mind before (if and when) the Safaris.  I don't think there is any 
rocket science to making a Safari window that doesn't leak if you can tweak 
the design a bit.  Of course thinking and doing are two different things!  
8-)  It would be a long term project in any event and the shifter extensions 
have to pay for themselves first.

Luckily from my past employment I have made a lot of good contacts in the 
manufacturing industry. So I have the technology and the contacts available 
to me all I need is the cash.  Realizing this, (**Not saying I am going to do 
this yet**) I **may**, in the near future, be offering some stuff for sale to 
raise money - NOS single cab side gates, Solid '53 Barndoor Kombi, *Rare* 
barndoor rear hatch.  None of this will be cheap.  If there is anyone 
SERIOUSLY interested please Pmail me.  No tire kickers or price checkers 
please.

BTW, I welcome any ideas for things to be reproduced.

Thanks for listening,
Dan
