&gt; I must admit...I am a little confused.  Today, yet another VW person
&gt; responded to my using the term &quot;Sea Blue&quot; with &quot;...oh, the bug color?&quot;
And
&gt; I must admit, after looking through the vintagebus_dot_com registry, that the
&gt; color swatches next to the many buses that had Sea Blue as part of their
&gt; makeup looked nothing like what I am calling Sea Blue....nor did the color
&gt; of the sample in a recent VW mag....
&gt;
My '65 Squareback was Sea Blau, peep this:

That Bug looked Sea Blue too.

It's near impossible for you to pick a color off the web or in a magazine
and get the right color too many variables.

I have a perfect original paint Dove Blue radio blockoff plate to use as a
match for my Bus, good idea?
