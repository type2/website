So VanBondo wants to rest his weary head in Irvine. Bahahaha. Doesn't he know 
that Irvine only allows late model Lexus or at the minimum Honda Accuras'. 
The sight of all those old buses will send the town fathers scampering for a 
police and wreckers convention. You say you want to adjust your valves in the 
parking lot &lt;snigger&gt; you must be from outa town boy! 'sides Anaheim is much 
more amusing with motels shaped like mountains or lite by tiki torches, you'd 
feel much more at home with a cowboy hat and Hawaiian shirt, blend right in 
with the tourists. And the city fathers are much more generous sending 
welcoming women direct to your motel door and at reduced rates too.
serious note; there are plenty of motel/hotels right off the 55fwy much 
closer to the pond

who will be there not in a split and will probably be banished to the outer 
lots
