Subject: Sealant or not?

Quick question from a novas new to the VW thang!
Just lost my motor pulling virginity to my '66 splity that needs a
rebuilt transaxle. It does not have the reduction gears, which probably
does not matter. I noticed that on one side there was silicon or some
type of sealant used around the wheel bearing on the end of the axle and
on one side there was none used. Which way is recommended and if to use
a sealant, does it matter what type?
Thanx for your help!!
