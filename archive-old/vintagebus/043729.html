&gt;We are going to make curtains for our Westy...we have the track from the
&gt;front sliding curtains, but all the little sliding plastic pieces are
&gt;broken.

Is this the frob you're looking for?

This goes in the metal track for the curtains in my house.  The round
part goes in the track and the curtains have hooks in them that go
through the hole at the other end.

If that's what you want, I bought a couple of packages of them at
Wal-Mart.  They don't live in the sewing/fabric/crafts area; they
are with the blinds/curtains (usually close to towels/sheets).

If that's not what you want, you might try an RV or boat shop...
maybe they have similar curtains.  Or, maybe one of those &quot;Bed Bath
and Beyond&quot; chain home decorating stores. 

I hope this helps!
