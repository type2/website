&gt; Also, those infra red temp guns are not like pointing a gun, and
&gt; reading a pin-point temp. Last one I looked at, the area read was
&gt; fanned out big time. It was something like a 20&quot; diameter from 12&quot;
&gt; away. How accurate do you think the readings were? 

about the ir guns. I borrowed a decent one from work &amp; am looking at
it right now. the spread on it is nothing like you remember eric. Mine
says 1.5&quot; at 12&quot; distance. So it is more accurate than you think, that
being said. it's just external temps, so take it w/ a grain of salt. I
do find it funny that that rag keeps flip/flopping on the synth topic.
one month it talks about how bad synth is then next its the greatest
thing since sliced bread. But then again if you believe everything you
read......
