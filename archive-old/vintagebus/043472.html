&gt;It was a mid year...lets use up all the slash end bumpers and then put
&gt;on the rounded end ones kind of thing.  If anyone has a definitive date,
&gt;speak up.  It would solve a mystery....at least for me.

No definite date, but I do have a couple of interesting entries from 
the Stefan Doliwa book, translated from German:

In the narrative for 1965:
&quot;The bumper ends are rounded off, they were partly tapered since 1963.&quot;

Under the 1965 yearly changes:
---
2 Aug 65  266 000 002  Pickup: Back window enlarged.  Cooling air vents
                       on sides over wheel wells; were in rear side
                       corners.  Treasure chest door with two air vents;
                       was three.
                       Bumper ends rounded off; were diagonal.
---

Note that this would have been the second '66 built.  Also, with the 
way the typography is done in the rest of the book, it seems like the
bumper change mentioned applied to all models, not just the Pickup.

For the introduction to the 1966 changes, there is a picture of a '66
Kombi credited to Stiftung.  The caption reads, &quot;On 1966 models the
bumper ends were rounded off; the introduction of the new bumpers with
the symmetrically rounded corners had begun in the spring of 1965.&quot;

It sounds like they started installing the round bumpers intermittently
in spring '65 and by the summer time, when the '66 models were introduced,
they were standard.

Not much more precise, but a little more info, anyway.
