Yes, probably. Before you shop, get thee to your shop and make this one into
a road kit spare. Hold it together in your hand and see how it mounts. Drill
three holes to bolt the two halves back together with socket head allen
screws and nylock nuts through the flanges. Make sure the holes will be
where you can get to them on the bus, as in not on top, capiche? Nice thing
about a two part coupler is it can be installed without moving the tranny
back, and you can subsitute anything for the middle of the sandwich.
Leather, rubber, Teflon, polyurethane, whatever strikes your fancy. The old
one comes out dandy once it has separated, why not install the new one the
same way? So, make your broke one into a spare, buy your new one and modify
it using what you have learned from the exercise. Of course, the pressed
together style don't work as good for this mod, not like the old style
sandwich, but the poly ones work perfect.

&gt; Question:  The coupler that was down there was red urethane.  Why aren't
they made
&gt; out of metal?  Does that much vibration get absorbed by the non-metal
couplers?
