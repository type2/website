just now i turned the key into the off position and pulled it out, when the 
engine decided to keep on running. i recently replaced the gen. brushes (if 
that matters), it is all 12v and the fuses seem to be ok. i then choked the 
engine and all the electrics still remained on (oil and gen light). for now i 
have disconnected the battery, could this be the ignition switch/system? any 
info always appreciated
                      thanks
                              phil
