I don't know if you have a home depot where you live at, but Harbor Freight
tools has this stuff also.
I went and bought small polishing wheels in three different grades, and the
polishing compounds to do this.  After sanding down any imperfections with
fine grit sandpaper, I then put on the first compound with the coarse
wheels, then work my way through the other two compounds, and wheels (the
back of the boxes will tell you what the wheels, and compounds are for.). I
can't remember what the other ones are called, but the final compound is
jewelers rouge. I polished a set of non polished 5 spoke empi's with this
method.

Hope this helps
Charles

&gt; Trying shine up my aluminum belt-line molding and bumper garnish on my
&gt; deluxe.  Current method is to sand with 400-600 grit wet/dry sand paper,
&gt; then polish with Dico polishing compound.  Just curious if anyone has any
&gt; other ideas on how to do this?
&gt;
&gt; Thank you,
&gt; HK
