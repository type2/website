A quick note that I just added a bunch of new items to the Online Garage
Sale this evening.  Some Sachs clutch stuff and lots of other goodies.

Toll-Free for Orders by PART # :  1-866-BUS-DEPOT 


&gt; We did some spring cleaning this week, and found a lot of
&gt; accumulated NOS parts, one-of-a-kinds, customer returns, etc. 
&gt; that have been gathering dust. So I've decided to run our 
&gt; first-ever online Bus Depot Garage Sale.
&gt; 
&gt; Everything in the Garage Sale is below cost - typically 50 to
&gt; 80 percent off - and most is brand new. There's something for 
&gt; almost every VW, from Busses, Vanagons, and Eurovans to 
&gt; Beetles, Type 3's, and Golfs.
