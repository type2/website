&gt; We've all heard the urban legend about the supposed plans for the

NQ,
If you are really into this sort of stuff, 
look on egoups or other mail list severs 
for &quot;super carbs&quot; or such...
There are people out there in art bell land that have this interest.

check my links on the fish carb

http://sites_dot_netscape_dot_net/labmission/misclinks

and if you find out why harry brown is no longer manufacturing the 
Fish w/o giving him money, fill us in

check his link:  THE 100 MPG CARBURETOR MYTH _at_

http://www.mikebrownsolutions_dot_com/fish3.htm

keep an eye out for the fish VW linkage kit at swaps and such

something else that is really there  (but really out there also) 
is the grouse (sp?) jet ball float seat (in place of the needle valve)

from the gulf shores of Tampa to the far off Hawaiian isles 
aloha from coast to coast art bell listeners and space aliens....
