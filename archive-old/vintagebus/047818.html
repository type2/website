...is supposed to flash when the e-flashers are on, yes?  But on my '65
standard there's no wire coming out of the back (thanks, PO), and the
light doesn't appear on the wiring diagram.  What's it _supposed_ to
connect to?

blue wire runs to the blinky outlet on the e light flasher under the kick 
panel on passenger side.     (off the top of my head here, but that would 
make it blink with the Es and not with the turns)   you can use a test light 
to find a blinky outlet on the 4 prog Eblink box
