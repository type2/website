&gt; how'd you do it?

I used Mothers polish, an actual brand name. and did it by hand. The
aluminum belt trim can be hand polished to look like chrome.  I then
sealed it with Crystal Top Coat, applied EXACTLY as directed - get it from
your local POR15 distributor:


POR15 The Finished Look

restoration chemicals

You will need a paint booth to properly apply the Top Coat.

My trim still looks like chrome three years later - the bus is garaged,
however. 

YMMV
