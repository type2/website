Subject: FUEL PUMP WARNING
Date: Thu, 15 Mar 2001 09:12:27 -0800
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

There has been a problem with the BROSOL 113 127 025D fuel pumps, the arm
inside (the rod pushs on) have been breaking in half within a few hundred
miles. Brosol has changed this part in their lastest fuel pumps and they
aren't working. This is the dome style pump (alternator style) for the Long
push rod. As of late I haven't heard of any problems with the BROSOL 113 127
025BCD, this is the pump with the outlet on top, but upon inspection it is
useing the same style arm inside as the 113 127 025D (I haven't had a rash
of these returned, actualy none). If available try to find the BOCAR brand
(OEM Mexico) 113 127 025 BCD, I haven't had any of these returned, ever,
after 2 years.
