&gt; I have the same problem on my Baja Bug right now. The boots have the VW logo 
&gt; on them and the package stated that they are from Germany. I installed them 
&gt; last summer and they are so cracked that they look as though they will split 
&gt; open at any moment.

this is yet another example of my dont trust german rubber credo... hard
parts i prefer german, rubber its anything but... (i think most of the
german stuff has been sitting on a shelf for 20+ years and is already bad
when you get it...)

peas,

p.s. i followed hoovers advice and bought urethane axle boots.  They have
em in black and i'll probably never have to touch em again according to
everything ive heard... (putting em on in the next couple days, ill write
up how they fit etc.)
