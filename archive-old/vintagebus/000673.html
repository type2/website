    The safaris that I ordered were around $515 US plus $60 for shipping here 
to AZ.  The price included the &quot;one-eyed duck,&quot; wiper disconnects, seals, 
glass, frames and all the hardware needed to install.  Tel: 01258-863600 in Wi
ltshire, England?  

    It looks to me that just bending the two 90 degree angles in the antenna 
moving it out of the way will be the way to go for now.  Its pretty neat 
seeing those antannas in the middle through the emblem but then i would have 
to fill in the antenna holes on the side. And besides, it would just give my 
friends more reason to tell me to lower it (since they look so good on low 
busses.) Don't need that right now :)
