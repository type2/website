Cal, interesting you mention the diodes... if you use the 431.951.253.G 
12v 40a relay,,, it has a diode in the coil ciruit from the mfgr ...
if you use a 10 awg wire,, you don't have to worry about the huge surge of
power swap between batteries, so the diode isn't really necessary in
actual practice,, sounds good in theory though.

That relay has a VERY high impedance coil,, and I'd like to find a few ...
anyone know where there is a 12v 40amp relay, little square purple box
about 25mm square?

The dc resistance on this relay coil is about 1.85M ohms
That makes it great to use to control the radio from the key buzzer
circuit.. and as a hot start relay.

&gt; I'd only use the first circuit - you don't want the pooped battery being
&gt; connected to the starting battery as soon as the ign switch is trying to
&gt; start the car (what the second circuit is doing). I'd connect some series
&gt; diodes with the relay coil in the first circuit, to raise the relay's
&gt; operating threshold to at least 12 volts, so that it isn't connected to
&gt; the starter battery until the genny/alt is producing at least 12 volts,
&gt; meaning the engine is definitely running, not just turning fast during
&gt; start.
