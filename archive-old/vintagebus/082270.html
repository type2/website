Subject: Ball joint/ torsion arm disappointment 69 Bus.

Ball joint/ torsion arm disappointment 69 Bus.

I replaced the torsion arms with rebuilt ones from bus boys. I replaced 
the steering dampener and draglink. The tierods are not old and seem 
fine. New shocks all around. I expected to drive away and have a new 
front-end feel. Nothing doing. It seems as bad or worse than before. I 
am still all over the road in this bus. It was windy on the test drive 
but come on. What else can I do?

I am going to take it for an alignment tomorrow and that might help but 
not feeling too good about this.

Damn.

Anyway, a thread recently suggested a problem getting the lower torsion 
arm off the spindle. I was dreading that but a couple whacks with the 
BFH was all I needed.

Thanks to Mr. What A Guy, Jon Stainkamp for all the help and advice. I 
could have not done it without his e-mail and telephone support.

It really is not a bad job to do if you have the replacement parts 
ready. Took 4 hours in a shop with a lift. I would not do it on the ground

I did find one interesting thing. I guess one PO had trouble getting the 
metal leaves to line up with the torsion arm so must have lined them up 
manually and then put a bead weld across the end to keep them lined up. 
Interesting. It broke in one place.
