Volks:

This thought has been on my mind for some time now, and for whatever reason I thought it is worth saying.  Maybe it's because of all of the eBay posts of late, or the fact that I personally am doing it and have been for some time now.

What it is that I'm referring to is how a lot of us reinvest in Volkswagen everyday.  A few examples.  I started making bed slats for pickups a few years ago.  Sure I wanted to make a small profit, but guess where I spent the profits if any?  Buying VW parts.  I made a few tilts.  Where did those funds go after the sale, bake into more VW stuff.  This whole eBay craze.  I'm selling every little damn part I can find in my shed now, because I need to finish the Westy and need bread.  But again, every damn penny I end up getting for something goes right back into another VW part or accessory of some type.

The NOS swivel seat up on eBay right now.  I think it's Greg's at Vintage Warehouse.  I have a sneaking suspicion as to why he's probably selling it.  One, we all saw the swivel seat a few weeks ago sell for big bucks, but more imprtantly, two, he's getting ready to buy a RHD Barndoor.  So, yes, he's trying to sell it for as much as he can, but at least he's reinvesting back into the VW community.  (this is only speculation with Greg, sorry if I'm wrong)  All I'm trying to point out is that it's all of us who are keeping not only the hobby of VW alive, but also the business of it.  A lot of $$ are getting passed around, but I'm guessing most are staying in the VW world.

So what in the heck am I saying?  In general, I'm saying that often times I see negative posts about other list members or people in the VW community *ripping* people off by charging way too much for something or selling on eBay just because they know they can get more money for it.  Granted, there are some folks that are feeding off of us VW freaks and taking the money to help buy a new SUV.  But I would have to say this is not a large percentage.  Just try and remember that most people, on eBay or any of the other internet classifieds, are selling vehicles and parts so that they can buy another VW or VW part that is more attractive to them at that given moment.

So keep on selling and buying, I know I am.  It's our $$ that keep the hobby alive!!!!

Robert
