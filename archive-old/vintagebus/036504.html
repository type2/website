&lt;&lt; anyone know? if i need a vented cap where do i get one? &gt;&gt;

Hi Kevin,
Yes you do need a vented one.  Recently we heard of a BMW problem where the 
venting system would be nearly or completely clogged shut by spider nest/s.  
Result was gas tanks compressing and expanding over and over till the tank 
walls failed due to workhardening and thusly fractured.  Kind of like what 
eventually happens to steel clothes hanger!  SNAP!
