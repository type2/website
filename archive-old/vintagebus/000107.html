Subject: [VB] interior mirrors and windshields
Message-ID: &lt;0.33a11fbf.254d6c41_at_aol_dot_com&gt;

Hi:
    I took the interior mirror out of my bus today and compared with another 
mirror that I have.  I found that even they look identical but they are from 
different brand, hogus &amp;
fam.  Both of them have vw symbol but I can't find the part number anywhere.  
I was told that the fam one came from a 63 bus.  Are they original vw parts 
for bus and is the fam one really from a 63 bus?  Also, I found the 
windshields in my bus have DELOG mark instead of sigla or sekruit.  Are they 
common in a later bus?
Thanks.
