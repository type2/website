I just aquired a free 1600 single port. I have no need for this
motor and thought I would pass it on. The previous owner said it
ran fine from CA to OR and they just decided to put in a 1776.
You would need to pick it up at my house in White Salmon WA
(which is one hour east of Portland OR). I also have a pretty good
stack of old bus brake drums. I have early small nut rear drums
and early big bearing front drums as well as some later drums.
All the brake drums are for split window busses. It would be
great if someone needed the whole package.

Hope this helps someone,
Craig
