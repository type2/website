Subject: Just Bought 67 Bus - Have Questions

Welcome me to the list! I've had baywindows for years but now have entered 
splittydom.
Just bought a nice original owner 67 Standard here in Maryland and I want to 
get it in shape for an extended summer trip out west.
I'm building a bone stock motor with the exception of a torque cam and 87mm 
p's and c's. I want to hook up the stock air cleaner and preheat setup. My 
question is; can I use a paper filter in the oilbath aircleaner housing? Has 
anyone done this? I've read that in dusty climates you have to clean the oil 
bath filter every 1000 miles or so and I dont want to fool with it - is that 
so?
I also want to redo my whole brake system before I go and dont want to spend 
that rediculous amount on a master cylinder. I heard that you can use a 
baywindow master cylinder with a few mods? Or, do they sell rebuild kits for 
the original? Thanks, Sam.
