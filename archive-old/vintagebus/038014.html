&gt;&gt;Bob,
Don't know if you've been following the lowering thread but I thought you
might be interested in this... &gt;&gt;  (massive snip)

To All:

I'm not.

It's their bus, not yours or mine.  If they want to ruin it, that's up to
them.    

I'll assume the message about 'originality' and 'self-expression' was a joke.
In the VW community lowered buses reflect the same degree of 'originality' and
'self-expression' as does removing your clothes to bathe... but without the
intrinsic practicality.

Lowered buses are kewl.  Everyone sez so... when they are young.  As they get
older they come to understand that practicality has lasting value, that it's a
bit silly to own a vehicle that is unsafe to drive, no matter how kewl it
looks.  In time, they grow out of the kewl phase.  

Unfortunately, the buses don't.  

-Bob Hoover
