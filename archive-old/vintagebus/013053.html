&gt;Irvine, California,
&gt;	I removed the engine in my '67 bus in Irvine several times in public
&gt;places.  A cop stopped by once just after the engine came out and was
&gt;sitting next to the side cargo doors.  He told me that I can't do that
&gt;here! looked at the engine on the ground and left.  I guess I just did
&gt;it!  Irvine is a sick and twisted place that I use to call home for 6
&gt;years(UCI, right).  Irvine does not want to be bad.  Money makes it
