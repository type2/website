Craig,

Keep us updated on this conversion!  Great writing, right level of technical
stuff (for me, at least) and it's interesting reading!
OT - I saw part of a movie on AMC last night that had your quote in it.  You
know what the movie was?  I couldn't find it on the on-screen channel guide.

Paul

  Sunday I arose early and set about the next phase of the conversion. Since
I have to work on Rosie in my driveway and can't put her back in the garage
without her wheels, I determined it was best if I only tackled one wheel at
a time. That would allow me the maximum amount of daylight to solve any
unforeseen problems and get her wheel back on before nightfall. The
passenger side was first. I removed the wheel, brake drum, bearing spacer
(slid right off!), flex line and backing  plate. I removed the race for the
inboard bearing from the brake drum and installed it in the new hub. I then
packed the bearing with high temp grease, installed it and the new seal and
outboard bearing. Next, I installed the caliper bracket, which attaches to
the 4 holes previously used to hold the brake cylinders/backing plate. Nice
fit, new socket head cap screws provided with the kit. Then came the
installation of the hub on the spindle, adjust the bearings and lock them
down with the new lock plates provided. Everything was going way too
smoothly. Put the rotor and wide 5 adapter plate on the hub (calipers and
rotors also provided by Karl von Salzen, thanks again Karl).  Mounted the
caliper on the bracket, good alignment and fit up. I decided it was time to
call it quits and put the wheel on. Tightened all the lug nuts and
then...... I discovered that the wheel wouldn't turn! Interference with the
caliper housing, damn! Took the wheel back off, removed the caliper, put the
wheel back on, and rolled her in the garage.
