Subject: RE: [VB] pulley ratio - 356/912 pulley offset issues?

&gt;ps. His name is Gary at Parts Obsolete
He's the guy that got me started in the Porsche resto biz over 23 years ago&lt;

Oops, his name does seem to be Gary and not Greg.  I must have heard him
incorrectly on the phone... Back to Dale Carnegie classes for me :(  (waste
of time, been there, done that, got the plack collecting dust somewhere -
luckily free) 

Also when I refer to the &quot;good German&quot; stuff I mean the tab style over the
&quot;D&quot; style :)  The tabs work very well, why mess up a good thing with the &quot;D&quot;
style?


Thanks,
Adrian S. Pillow
