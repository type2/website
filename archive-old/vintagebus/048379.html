60 are earlier busses have a plastic beading in the slider rails.
58 and early front header bows use wood &amp; metal  blocks instead of plastic.
58 and earlier header bow has different internal mechanish, a extra two metal 
sleeves inside, and has three sets of scres on the bottom instead of two.
I believe that is the only differences!
WORD!

&lt;&lt;Was comparing two different bus sunroofs today.  One from a '57 and one 
from 
a '67.   I noticed that the handles as well as the rails that fasten to the 
bus are different.  Evidently there is at least two different styles of 
sunroofs for the bus (I know there are 3 or more cloth sunroofs for the bug)  
Anyone know more about this?
