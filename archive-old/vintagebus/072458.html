Subject: Re: [VB] Painters, ever experiance this?  (Paint trouble on DC)

The paint did not flow great but i think that is because i did not put

Both humidity and temperatures make a big difference in your results.
Most paint (professional suppliers) have a selection of reducers to
handle these variables.
