I saw some info on redline, if i remember correctly it is synthetic?  i will
have to call them, as i didn't see it on their site, only amsoil automatic
transmission fluid.

is their a specific type of redline I should get, or is there only one type.

thanks.

Go to aircooled_dot_net and pay the outrageous price for red line.  It really 
will make a diffeerence in the performance and life of your transmission.
