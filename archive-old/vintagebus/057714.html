Subject: Vw art from PARC

Hi all,

About a month or so ago somebody posted a link to PARC
(http://www.parc_dot_de/v3/index.html?lang=en) that has a bunch of postcards
and posters from the old classic VW art.  I just wanted to let everybody
know, I ordered a bunch of stuff from them and it all came today and is
AWESOME.  I ordered a bunch of the old postcards and plan on framing
them for out in the garage.  And I ordered a couple of posters.  All of
which is great quality.  Here is an example of one of the postcards from
there site.  http://www.parc_dot_de/v3/pictures/volkswagen/p4627-c.jpg

Click detailed search and select the make &quot;Volkswagen&quot;, and click search

I don't have any connection to PARC, but went out on a limb, ordered
from them and just thought I would share my experience as they were
great to do business with.
