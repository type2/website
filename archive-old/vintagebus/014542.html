&lt;&lt; Thanks for the info, but am looking for the specific type for the micro 
bus.  From the images I've seen, seemed to be a kind of rectangular face unit 
with either three or four round vents on the face.&gt;&gt;
Hi Albert,
Yes, that is the type we have seen in old Popular Mechanics articles as a 
&quot;new&quot; add on to your late 50s or early 60s auto.  So far as we have seen the 
only sold by VOA specific ones that were for bus went into and on the rear 
roof of the bus.  Up to 1968ish AC was frowned apon by VAG.  If anyone else 
has better info we would love to hear about it.
