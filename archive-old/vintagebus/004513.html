the main prob with the inserts is the edge of the whitewall starts to dig
VERY deeply into the sidewalls of your tires after a while which can mean
danger. Also they are known to rip and then that means a trip back down to
the tire shop to have them removed. Best to fork out the cash and go to
COKER tire or someplace and get the real deal, OR i know of a guy in cali
who will take your tires and cut the whitewall into them and paint them,
thus, turning it into a real whitewall. I can prolly get the info for that
if you want to take that route.
