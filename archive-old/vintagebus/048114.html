Thanks for all the input everybody.  I got some mixed comments though.  I
heard everything from pretty rare to nothing special.  The price range I got
was from $1200-$2500.  

Here is some more info and questions.
The guy wants $2500 for it.  I think it runs, but the muffler is totally
rusted right off.  Jeff had a good point about structural integrity with the
seat panel cut out.  I will try to check for cracks around the door pillars.
There are skin panels covering the undercarraige.  I will try to get the m-
code, but I believe the doors are factory installed.  As far as the model, I
was told it was a panel van ( no windows on side) and that the windows were
added later.  The the windows are aluminum ,I think,and look generic.  If the
windows were stock it would be called a kombi.....right?  (remember I am a
ghia guy).  If it was a panel I would like to return it to a panel van.  I
don't care to much for the camper windows....although since they are already
there I have talked about taking the family camping in it.  ( tents on  both
sides....cool)   I would like to put the panel back in behind the front seat
and find a stock front bench.  Although with bucket seats it is almost a walk
through.  This could be nice when the kids are unhappy.  But the question of
body integrity without the panel is there.  Is the undercarriage skin enough
or should the panel go back in?

Would this be a 12V or 6V system in 63'?

Thanks again,
Steve
