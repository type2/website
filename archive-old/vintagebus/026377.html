Subject: [VB] fan shroud, oil cooler q's
Message-ID: &lt;3842D06B.701A71E4_at_silcon_dot_com&gt;

Greetings, all knowing list!
Yesterday afternoon I had the good fortune to find a oil cooler, shroud,
fan, front tin and thermal flaps at a wrecking yard in VERY good
condition.  Perfect, since I have been in the market for at least a
cooler, and I have been convinced to &quot;upgrade&quot; from the stock setup on
my 1600 sp (pre doghouse).

1) Any thoughts on the value of the thermal flaps (at the base of the
shroud, on each side)?  It appears that many uprights are without...
(including my recently acquired 66 with rebuilt 1600 sp!)

2) The parts were from a 74 bug...  At first glance, it appears that
everything will fit nicely on my bus' 1600.  But I noticed that the
shroud completely covers the oil cooler, and exits thorough a port in
the front tin.  This appears different from other shrouds that have one
side of the cooler exposed on the backside of the shroud.

My question...  will the 74 parts work?

3) Finally, any cautions on the installation of these parts?  It seems
straight forward.

Thanks in advance.
