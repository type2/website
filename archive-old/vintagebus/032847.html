Not to mention how tough pre-61 truck corners are to find!!!!!!!!!
Not sure if its like this everywhere or just southern california, but were 
scraping the bottom of the barell when it comes to parts and busses!!!!!!!!!!

&lt;&lt; Either or bigger hole or another hole , no reason to replace the whole 
corner 
thats overkill, I can resize the hole in 1/3 the time it takes to replace a 
corner,and you won't know the difference unless i show you, my opnion save 
the corner money for something else and fill the hole, NOTE : FILL not slap a 
patch over it, take the time to cut a filler metal and weld it in slowly,but 
thats my .02,Later
