&gt; #2) Interior lights. I've got two interior light fixtures that came with the 
&gt; Westy.  &gt; These lights are about 6&quot; long and hold two tube type bulbs but 
&gt; have no covers. Are they worth reinstalling or should I find alternate 
&gt; lights?
&gt; Guess the real question is; where do I get the covers &amp; how much?

Hi Stan,
Tube type bulbs?  Sounds like a floresent bulb installation.  The original 
Westie interior lights used standard one filament automotive bulbs.

&gt; #3) The interior parts were just floating loose, stacked in the van when I 
&gt; got it.
&gt; There was no sink (I can live with that).

Never was one.

&gt; There was no Ice Box or water tank. (I can live with that too).

There should have been one of each.

&gt; There was no Stove (I don't like that).

There were none installed in pre-1968 VW buses.  Get a Coleman two or three 
burner.

&gt; What could I expect to see in a 66 Westy with walk through seats?

A walk thru interior.

&gt; Need pics if you can send or direct me to decent interior shots.
&gt; Possibly this vehicle may been a Weekender or some thing else but still
&gt; carried the Westfalia placard.

Sounds cool.  
Eric&amp;Barb
