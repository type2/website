hi all,

I FINALLY got the front beam out yesterday.  The coupler for the shifter a
PO had broken the bolts off, so i tried and triewd to break them free
with no luck :(  Then i drilled out the pins... but i got scared when the
drill got deeper as i didnt want to ruin the shift rods... so i broke out
the grinder.  That didnt do the trick so i drilled some more.  Then that
didnt work  so i broke out the chisel and tried to chisel it off.

This kinda scares me as i realized later that night that the shift rod is
coupled to the transmission, i hope my banging didnt bend anything in
there!!

Finally i was completely frustrated and broke out the OA cutting torch...
that did the trick... Once i had it out though, i realized i could have
drilled deeper without hurting anything on the shift rod and saved myself
a lot of work and worry over the transmission.  Oh well, my friend is
giving me a spare, so if i killed it i can replace it and use this one for
spare drums/reduction parts etc.

All in all a grand learning experience... and i only nicked the very end
of my shift rod with the cutting torch, its still perfectly serviceable :)

Now i am wire wheeling and preparing all the surface rust in teh beam area
for por-15.  I figure itll be easier to do with the beam out.

Also, i had to take the drag link out.  I had bought the VW tool for
removing tie rod ends and was wondering if i had wasted my money and if i
should have purchased a pickle fork instead.

The tool was perfect!  i thought it might not work on the draglink to
steering box joint, but with a little ingenuity it did the trick.

Unless the arm off the steering box is straight up and down you cant get
the tool on the drag link end.  and once you get it on there it seems like
there is no way to get a wrench to it to tighten the tool, but there is...

Put a socket on teh nut of the tool with a wobble joint.  Then stick a
long extension through the hole in the frame rail near the horn mount and
put the end into the wobble extension.

I had to torque this puppy with a breaker bar to get it undone!! i was
afraid i was going to break the tool it was that tight...

After this experience i will say that this tool is a must have for me.  It
makes a job i've struggled with in the past so easy that its not even an
issue.

Dropping the beam was so simple after all that it was great.  When i
reinstall a coupler im ging to put so much anti sieze all up in that mutha
that it'll look like its painted silver with way too much paint...

Oh its funny.  I was trying to weld a nut onto something and it fell off..
I went to pick it up and heard a hiss... burned the tip of my finger
pretty good.  then the next day i forgot to put out a cigarette and later
put the palm of my hand on the floor to get up, and waht do you know if i
didnt put the palm of the same hand right on it and burn myself again...
hehe.

Well thats about it for this weekend, more to come... (pictures of my
progress hopefully before too long...)

peas,

Steve
