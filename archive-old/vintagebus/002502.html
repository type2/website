Jeez, thanks. I'll remember that :)

As to why I'm asking for a contact in Vancouver (Canada); I would like to
research where to go and who to talk to so I getting the best for my baby.
Which is why I'm asking about type2 resources first. When I get that all
that figured out then I'll follow your recipe to the letter. :)

p.s ... can you please kill your caps lock.

cheers,

Cary.
