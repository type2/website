Subject: The Mystery Machine clone is no more?

Saw this message on another list..anyone know the deal? I remember seeing pics
of it
a while back.





&gt; Yesterday, I was heading north on 101, and I saw a Bus
 I had seen before.

 It's a VW microbus (of course), and it has a paint job
 very much like the Mystery Machine in Scooby Doo.
I've seen it driving around the Central Coast region
 before. Many times.

 Unfortunately, this time, it was on a flatbed truck,
headed south, front end bashed in back to the door
 frame on the driver's side - looks like, if it was  moving, the driver
apparently did not make it.

If anyone knows the owner of this bus, my condolences
 to them, whether they made it out alive or not.&lt;
