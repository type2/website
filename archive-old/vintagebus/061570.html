Subject: Re: [VB] Oil temperature - Alternative sender?

I have one of the senders that go in the presure relief bolt plug thing place.  It was made by VDO.  I guess they are still available.  It is nicer than the oil drain plug location because the latter can get broken if you put a jack under the motor to remove the motor.
