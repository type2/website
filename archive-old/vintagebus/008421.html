&gt;1. should you put a coat of clear acrylic over a fresh metallic paint job.
&gt;The paint itself went on really well, and I reckon it would buff up, but
&gt;should I clear coat it anyway while its still masked and in &quot;painting mode&quot;

go to your paint manufacturer rep for the specifics. generally clearcoats are applied very
soon after the basecoat,not 24 hours later. (causes adhesion problems). and there is no
good reason to leave the masking material on more than a very short time, as you are
about to find out. the solvents make removal interesting and the tape edge rough.

&gt;2. can you / should you lightly sand a metallic (to get rid of
&gt;overspray/runs).

NO.

&gt;does it make the metallic effect go to crap?

YES.

hope this helps 8^)
