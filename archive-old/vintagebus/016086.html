Sounds like a good price, even if the tranny had issues.  The boxes are
a good score unto themselves.

Check the condition of the trans my manually putting it in gears and
then turning the input shaft.  Also see how much play there is by
turning one wheel (drum) and seeing how much delay there is before the
other one turns, and how smoothly.  You can also pull the plug and
look for surprises.  

The last Big Nut drum-to-drum that I sold I got $250 for, and that
was several years ago.

&gt; I found a guy that has a '66  transaxle drum-to-drum for sale that he's
&gt; willing to take $130 for.  It looks all original, no rust or cracks and
&gt; everything seems to turn/shift OK. The trans shaft wobbles about an
&gt; 1/8th in.  It's covered with road grime.  There's one bolt broken off in
&gt; one of the redux boxes. The drums seem good, but I haven't measured
&gt; them.  He was going to use it in a dune buggy, but decided to go with a
&gt; later IRS setup 'cause if it broke he could get parts for the IRS
&gt; easier.  Which is why I'm looking at it - spare parts for our '67.  It
&gt; seems like a decent price.  Anything else to look for ?
