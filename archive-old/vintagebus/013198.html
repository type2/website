Yes, a now former listmember did inadvertently send the happy99.exe
trojan v*rus.  I'm working on cleaning up the mess on this end, and trying
to tweak the list filters to prevent it from happening again.

For info on how to remove it, go to:

Things you can do to protect yourself, now and in the future:

* NEVER run an .exe, _dot_com or any other executable content that
you recieve in email.  I don't care how cool the sender sez
the attachment is.

* TURN OFF automatic execution of attachments.  I don't know what
idiot programmer decided that was a good feature, but he should
be taken out and shot.
