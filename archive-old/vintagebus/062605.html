Subject: RE: [VB] 205/75/15 Tires?


&gt;Uniroyal Tiger Paws&lt;

Not the best tire in my opinion, but if you like them more power to you.  I 
have a set on 14&quot; rims and hate them, 195/75/R14... Sitting in a pile in the 
backyard.


The 205/75R15 should fit.  Actually a 215 will fit as well.

How are they jacking up the bus?  The swing axle must be unloaded so that it 
hands down to access all the lugs and the tire can fit up in the whole.  If 
they used a lift and put it on the swing arm or RGBs it will be impossible 
to get a tire on.

...  The only solution I see is to cut the wheel wells!  :(  LOL  just 
kidding

Good Luck,
Adrian Pillow
