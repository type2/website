Subject: RE: [VB] Re: New Engine Oil Leak

case warped? cracked? end play? galley plug leaking? is it gear oil or
motor oil?  cam plug not seated/loose/too small(aftermarket)?  i am curious
how the cam would touch the main bearing. o-ring on the flywheel
torn/old/missing?  my case leaks back there (mainseal area) and no matter
how many seals i've put in, it leaks.  it's because i can take a pair of
pliers and squeeze the case halves together--directly below the mainseal. 
not alot, but enough to see oil squishing out and to realize it's warped
enough to leak when it gets warmed up.  i don't worry about it since it
only leaks a very small amount.  just a few suggestions.

 and looked under my bus for the hell of it, and there was like a pint 
&gt; of oil on the ground under the rear main!!!! (not oil cooler seals) this
is 
&gt; why i pulled the engine over the winter. now, this was after traveling
about 
&gt; 100 miles at like 4500rpm. on the way home last night i kept it at 55mph
and 
&gt; 4000rpm and every time i stopped there was like 4 drops of oil on the 
&gt; ground. didnt even need to add all the way home... ~175mi. WHAT GIVES?! 
&gt; someone suggested a little nick on the cam chewing up the rear main. i
dont 
&gt; get it... people say aircooled VWs are supposed to drip, i dont think so. 
&gt; what should i do, pull and replace rear main again?!
