Hi Chris,
It depends on which manufacture of fuel pump you have or the diaphram used in 
it when it was last rebuilt.  The German ones seem to last a long, long time. 
 The Brazilian ones only have one layer of membrane for a diaphram instead of 
the double thickness German fuel pumps have.  Plus the thickness of the 
Brazilian one layer membrane is about half of one layer of German material 
and about as strong as a cheap condum.  Eric&amp;Barb
