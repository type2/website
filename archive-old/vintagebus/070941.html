Subject: Re: [VB] '56 Single Cab

I haven't seen this one but I saw a mid-sixtys double cab in similar
condition at a local show in GA that a guy was asking $25,000 for. I think
he ended-up selling it for $18,000. Are mid-sixtys double cabs in more
demand that mid-fiftys single cabs?

&gt;&gt; I was wondering if anybody has ever seen this truck in person:

&gt;&gt;
&gt;Nice truck! Still seems priced high, but what do I know?  What was he
asking
before?
&gt;
I think $10,000
