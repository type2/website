Subject: Re: [VB] My brakes are clicking and moaning

&gt; But the pedal goes to floor on first try, then 2/3 on second pump, then
1/2 
&gt; way on third, and then I can stop.  So theres still air in there
somehow?
---------------------------- Clip --------------------------
Often when new wheel cylinders or other procedures require the brakes to
be bleed the master cylinder is pumped hard and with full strokes.
This procedure makes the MC piston travel, into previously unused bore
that can have rust or pitting that just simply scores the rubber seal on
the MC thimble. This causes the MC to fail just like you're describing.
