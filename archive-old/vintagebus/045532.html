ne note of interest for the '67 that I'm familiar with is that I
understood it to be the only year a 1 ton rear swing assembly was used.
If that is true, then it's pretty simple to determine since the drums are
very different and the axles are humongous too.
The 1 ton stuff, especially brake drums are getting very hard to come by.
At least those that are in good enough shape to be turned and re-used.
- -  --  
the 1 ton rear axle was used 64-67 , (and an option for 63, though some parts
are not the 64-67 kind)  I have extra 64-67 drums.    Good for doorstops.
