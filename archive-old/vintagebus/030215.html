Subject: re:t4 engine

I have wanted to run a T4 in a baja bug, I used to have one I rebuilt in
a 914. I want to run a holley 4 barrel on it. I have a 390cfm holley 4
barrel at the house. They were used for 4 cylinder racing. It is set up
for about a 2 liter motor. If your engine swap goes well, I will
definitely start looking at my baja bug idea again.
