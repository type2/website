This message inspired me to set my choke for the first time in 10 years of
driving vws, because you make it sound so simple to set the choke, but i
cant figure out how clockwise would make it longer, can you explain ?
like lets say you were a muir victim, and you had cranked the choke open,
you start by inserting the choke element so that the hook part grabs the
choke and turn it counterclockwise till the lines match up and then how much
further? i think i almost have it figured out and it seems that it would be
counterclockwise for more choke is that right?

&gt; I don't know how
&gt; setup the
&gt; choke. What's the procedure for that?&gt;&gt;
&gt; Loosen the three screws that hold the choke element in the carb.  Then
turn
&gt; the element counterclockwise for less or shorter choke.  Clockwise for
more
&gt; or longer choke.
