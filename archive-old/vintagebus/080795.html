&gt; Have you performed the classic &quot;rod test&quot; listed in Muir?

I believe that it's 15-20 seconds, not minutes! Yes, I did that a while
ago, and there was no evidence of rod clatter when the engine was spinning
down.

I think that I'm just gonna have to take the engine apart to the case, and
pull on those conn rods, check their clearances, and decide whether to
knock it all apart. After 75,000 miles, as one other said here, it's
prolly about time. Gene Berg, bless his long-gone heart, advises not to
rebuild an old case. I called them, they're still selling the magnesium
alloy cases, they won't have anything to do with aluminum ones, she said.
$475 for the dual PR 1970-type case. Price is not too much more than 1993,
last time I bought one (this present engine).

I have to make some time this next couple of weekends, to do the
inspection, then decide what to do. I'll keep the list informed; it should
be an interesting story.
