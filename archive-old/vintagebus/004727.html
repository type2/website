I'm having problems sorting the brakes out on my 60 bus.

story so far:
renewed rear cylinders and shoes.. pipes are all new. the brace bar was worn
a bit so the handbrake didn't work too well. so stripped all down again and
welded up the slots on the brace bars to compensate the wear. filed to suit
etc... everything fine - passed the mot test, went on trips - all was well.

this week, the brakes were starting to bind... so much so, when i got home
the rear drums were very hot. so i stripped them down figuring i'd just
welded too much in, - filed the slots down a bit.. so the braces were loose.
adjusted the brakes - went for run.... - still binding.

can't be the brace bars making it bind then.... oh yeah - one side is now
not binding - so i reckon that was sorted by the slots being filed.
but this one side is causing grief..
stripped down again last night - but this time they had been binding so bad
i couldn't get the drum off.. had to let some hydrolic oil out of the bleed
nipple to get the drum off... - so figures the pistons are stuck.... got my
old cylinder out of the bin.... and yup, the pistons were further out on the
new one. ???
so i undid the bleed nipple some more while squeezing the shoes inwards with
my knee and elbo. - (wish i had 3 arms!)
so what do you reckon it is.
gotta be either -

springs not strong enough to pull the shoes back - what with being new
cylinders?
or,  could it be a faulty cylinder?  anything else?

anyone else had grief like this?

btw, the springs are the short type (4 per drum) that each hook into the
back plate. (not from shoe to shoe)

i've a sneaky feeling tho it can't be the springs - my head says that - if
the shoes aren't pulled in enough by the springs - the pressure of the shoes
binding with drum should push them in enough.

so what could be up with the cylinder that it's not letting the flow back.

just remembered - when i thought the pistons were stuck i squeezed the shoes
together - they wouldn't go in but the pistons were free enough to both move
&gt;from side to side.  (hope this soundslike i mean it to)  - freely move side
to side staying equal distant - but not squeezing in together...   ??

Any suggestions appreciated.
