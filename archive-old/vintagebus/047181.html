The Arizona Bus Club is looking for just such a vehicle to restore for next
year's Jerome Jamboree raffle bus.  I don't remember what part of the country
you are in, but I'm sure we could work something out somehow if the price is
right.  In any event, please don't part it out, it sounds too good for that.
