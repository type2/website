Ulysses, The Mango Warrior, and I not only share a birth sign  .... but we
were born about 3 weeks apart.  Me - Feb. 26/60, the Warrior  - Mar. 18/60
so what's that - 20 days apart? Was 60 a leap year? I like the thought that
as I was being born in Eastern Canada, Ulysses was being born in Germany.
Poseidon must have had a change of heart and smiled at us as we greeted the
earth for the first time back in early 1960.  Anyway, I'm curious as to
whether there are any couples closer in birth date than the Mango Warrior
and I.

Very cool hey? - the irony of life, Ulysses, The Mango Warrior, being a
Piscean?   And the Mango Warrior, like the other Ulysses - has had many
great adventures yet he always finds his way back home.

Oh yeah, I found this beaded Plains Indian medallion that I hang on my dash
off of my ashtray - it was meant to be worn around the neck - it is a beaded
three stand neck lace with the beaded medallion on a deer hide backing - it
is made out of early glass beads - two shades of green - one shade is dark
the other is Mango.  In the centre is this sort of cross like shape - not a
Christian cross more of an odd shaped X.  Ulysses got it when he became a
full fledged Warrior ;)
