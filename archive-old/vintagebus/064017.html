Subject: [VB] [LVBC] it's got Kamax  bolts !

Low Vintage Bus content...I've been stripping the  the '88 Audi quattro
before its last trip to the auto wreckers and while taking off the front
suspension I discovered it has KAMAX bolts at least 12  17mm ones...Maybe
some of it will live one in the '63 Van.      Lloyd in Eureka, Calif
