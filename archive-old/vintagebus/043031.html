List,

There exists an awesome solution to the exhaust system rust-out, which i
applied to the spanking new exhaust extractor that I put on the 67 after
the restoration:

I sent the extractor to 

Jet Hot Header Coating
1840 W. Drake Drive
Tempe, Az 85283

602.831.8232

It came back in three days plus shipping. It is coated with a ceramic
heat-transferring coating, in and out, It will never rust, it is hard as a
rock, it cools off so fast, you can touch it several minutes after driving
100 miles. The coating is used on racing headers, jet planes, etc. 
Three different colors available - silver, black and clear (i believe -
its been years).


Check them out,

cal
