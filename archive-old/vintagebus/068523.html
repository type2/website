Subject: Tool organization

Weird discussion here. But figured it MIGHT be something fresh.

I'm in the process of putting my tools away in my new garage/shop. 
I'm the kinda guy who has collected odds and ends tools since i was a 
kid. Meaning...I find a screwdriver in the street, I grab it. I find 
some mix match of metric wrenches in a junk bug, I throw 'em in my 
tool chest.

Add to this the craftsman sets I've bought here and there over the 
years....and the many number of $19.99 tool kits I've bought for one 
of the cars that eventually ends up with missing pieces and the rest 
thrown in my tool chest.

My buddy who owns a shop has a nice organized set of tool chests with 
basically one of everything all in nice organized holders. I'm 
wondering if this is the way to go? Seems there's been more than once 
I can't find a 13mm wrench and can always just grab another out of 
the box. But my box is so full that sometimes it's hard to find 
stuff, and having the convience of just grabbing a spare seems to 
make it easy for me to make a mess.

Hate to not have the extras handy though.

Tell me about your tool organization and what works best for a 
cheapskate with tons of hand tools.
