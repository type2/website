What's the bolt for?

I noticed that the 'DORN' 8x20 mm bolts on my 59 dc are 13 mm heads while
the 8x22 mm 'Kamax' bolts for the rear hoops are 14 mm.

Also, what names do you find common on the bolt heads?

I find DORN, Kamax, and Rasche while many of the bolts on the front
suspension are 'RIBE' (all my tie rods and pitmann arms have the VW stamp on
them so I suspect they are original?)

head?
