Subject: RE: [VB] heavy shift knobs

As for using heavier than usual shift knobs, anyone know what the stock
weight is? I currently have a billiard ball (#15) on my shift lever, as
the original knob broke long ago, and I'd hate to think I'm damaging
something. It's a perfect size and shape for me, though, and would be a
shame to give it up, but I don't want to tear anything up. Any more info
on that?
thanks,

&gt; We hate to rain on your parade, but using glass as a shift knob is a bad
&gt;
&gt; idea, unless you can make it wiegh the same as the stock plastic shift
&gt; knob.  We
&gt; have seen VWs with solid glass door knobs used in this way and the
&gt; tranny
&gt; shifting forks in the tranny get worn out much sooner due to the extra
&gt; wieght.
&gt; Even in the owners manuals, year after year they state it is not a good
&gt; idea to
&gt; use the shifter as a hand rest for the same reason!
