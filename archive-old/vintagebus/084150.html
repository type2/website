Subject: Poor gas mileage

I just recently installed a 205M distributor on my '67. My in-town gas 
mileage dropped from 16mpg to 11 mpg. The previous dizzy was a 009. The 
1600 engine has a 30/31 carb. I have the vacuum line connected to the 
port just above the fuel shut-off solenoid. Points are gapped at .016, 
timing is at 32 degrees at full advance and TDC _at_ 800rpm with the vacuum 
line unplugged at the dizzy. The timing advancement seems real smooth, 
not jumping around. Could I be using the wrong vacuum port? I am no 
expert on the 30/31. Thanks for any ideas.

Rocky
