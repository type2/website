Subject: Re: [VB] Sloppy Steering - was Tie Rod Replacement

the only reason i can see for not doing this would be correct steering
wheel alignment and potential alignment problems. i would imagine you'd
have to get the passenger side exactly the correct length to make up for
them both being adjustable, since the alignment values are based on a fixed
length tie rod assembly.  but i would hope any competent alignment shop
should be able to get it right with 2 adjustable tie rods.

&gt; &gt;I'm gonna have to replace the non adjustable tierod on my bus soon and
&gt; &gt;noticed that you can get an adjustable tire rod for the passenger side as
&gt; &gt;well.  This would seem advantagous, I think the adjustable one is even
&gt; &gt;cheaper via busboys.  Any reason why I should not go adjustable on both
&gt; &gt;sides?
