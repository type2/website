Subject: Re: [VB] front tranny mount

When I have been in or driving a bus with a bad tranny mount there is a 
noticable lurch as the bus is shifted into another gear.  LIke the bus jumps 
forward slightly, and then is thrown back.  It is not comfortable, and is 
immediately noticable to the non mechanic as &quot;something is wrong&quot;

so there is a clunking when shifting, it could be in the tranny, it could be 
in the clutch, it could be in the fulcrum plates- if that areais worn you 
will feel/hear and clunk whe you step on the gas- if you drive carefully you 
can avoid the clunk, which is more wear happening in there.  say you are 
cruisng along in third gear, then take your foot off the gas, then step on 
the gas- if your FP areas are worn you will tell that clunk which is at the 
spade ends of the axles.

I had a 59 truck with severely worn FP areas, in fact when I first changed 
the gear oil I was concerned the tranny would work, as there were noticble 
pieces of FP that came out in the oil.  Anyway, it did work, and I drove it 
around for months,  and had to remeber to be careful with slowing/ 
accelerating as the thunk was not good.   I did mean to take it apart and fix 
it, but it was functional that way, and I was fixing some more important 
fuinctioning bits on it, and then I was persuaded to sell it (I warned the 
Next O about the axle shaftFPs).

anyway, that would not thunk when shifting exactly, but when you step on the 
gas right after shifting-  

You can heard this thunk in most buses to a certain small extent.

If it is during shifting I would check to make sure the shift linkage is all 
in good shape,  otherwise it is probably internal to the tranny.

when did you last change you gear oil?

I hope this makes sense, it is difficult to communication thunks and crunches 
through words and the situations they occure in, over a written medium

&gt;  well, i went and checked the mount again and tried pulling back on the
&gt;  fanhousing like you said, but the engine/tranny didnt tip up at all.  i
&gt;  tried tightening the bolts for the front mount, but they were already 
pretty
&gt;  tight.  it usually only clunks when im shifting into a higher gear, not
&gt;  really when im down shifting.  if im really cautious when shifting i can
&gt;  make it so there is no clunk.  is there anything else it could be besides
&gt;  the mounts?  the shift stick doesnt jump around and im not sure what you
&gt;  mean by &quot;lurch&quot;.  thanks for all the replies ive received so far!

&gt;  &gt; does the shift stick jump around?   does the bus lurch?   can you grab
&gt;  hold
&gt;  &gt; of the fan housing and pull back and have the front of the engine (and
&gt;  &gt; tranny) tip up?  then sounds like a bad front mount.
&gt;  &gt;
&gt;  &gt; you need to pull the motor out to chane it, and pull the rear wheel, pull
&gt;  the
&gt;  &gt; RGBoxes, apull the tranny back a few inches (you can leave the brake 
hoses
&gt;  &gt; connected) to get the old one out and get the new one in.   check the 
rear
&gt;  &gt; mounts too, they may help replacement.
&gt;  &gt;
&gt;  &gt; if you want to reseal the nose cone at trans case pull the tranny all the
&gt;  way
&gt;  &gt; out, and do that.  the leak by the rear shift coupleing woiuld be the
&gt;  hockey
&gt;  &gt; stick seal in the nose cone, you you could replace it too.
&gt;  &gt;
&gt;  &gt; bad front mounts can cause problems including cracked nose cones
