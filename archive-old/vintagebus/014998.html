So it is a Sundial, ha? Do you think I should keep it then? I wanted to
go back to it's original state as a panel but these windows would be
sticking out. I might want to keep the camper conversion but then there
is more work to be done. There are bug seats in the front just thrown in
and bolted to the floor with a help of a 2X4. My wife kind of likes these
better but I want to install originals back in. Also, speedo is euro with
km instead of miles. Now I know that it only has 82900 original
kilometers not miles. Maybe this baby came from Canada originally? Do you
think? Wow. Another thing, what is this thing installed in it? It looks
sort of like a Nitro system. It's in a back, in the engine compartment
and hooked up to the carburetor. I know the guy told me something about
hard start relay but I don't think it is. I'll have pix soon so that
might help.

Thanks
