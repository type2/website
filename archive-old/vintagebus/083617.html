&gt;&gt;  Hi E &amp; B,
I am decent at fabrication. The thing I lack is the &quot;tribal  knowledge&quot; on 
what parts work the best. I converted the single circuit 67  master cylinder to 
the 72 dual circuit m/c utilizing your prior advise. On  this project, what I 
am trying to find out is what are the secrets to saving  cash/time on the 
parts. Do you know of anyone who did the vacuum assist  conversion? If so, I could 
sure use the info on what the best parts  are.

Thanks for all the help you have provided to the  group,

-Rocky


Hi Rocky,
We are posting your Pmail and our response back to you, to the list.   We 
prefer this because we figure the more bus info on the vintagebus list  the 
better, and there is the possibility someone else has more experience,  or needs 
the same info, or can correct any errors we post.   ;-)
  So far we have not completed this, and do not know anyone  who has 
converted a pre-1971 bus front beam to vacuum booster.
  Best way we have come up to do this conversion is to have  easy access to a 
1971-79 bus or at least a front beam for  measurements.
  You will need a brake booster from a 1971-79 bus.  If you are  converting t
o disc brakes you will also need the 1971-79 proportioning  valve or risk 
having the rear brakes lock up first and do uncontrolled 180  degree spins.  This 
item MUST be installed with the correct angle or it  will not function 
properly.
  Eric has made part of a bracket to mount the brake  booster.  1/8&quot; thick 
sheet steel square (sized to fit between the  beams) with 3/8&quot; diameter steel 
rod welded to the L/R sides of the sheet  metal, and lathed out of solid steel 
for clamps to bolt directly onto  the beam.  We prefer changes to our VWs that 
can easily be changed  back if need be and welding directly on the front beam 
in situ with it full of  grease is not something we want to try.  If one 
wanted to take the front  beam completely apart and clean out all the grease one 
could weld directly to  the beam without any worries of flaming grease!
  The other problem is the steering dampener, which is on the driver  (LHD) 
side of the center pin.  This will have to be switched to the  passenger side 
of the center pin, and probably the easiest way to mount the  outer end of the 
dampener is to weld a bracket directly to the body, as was  done on 1955-60 
buses or pehaps make a clamping braket to mount on the  beam.
  The front splash pan would more than likely have to have a groove  cut into 
it to allow the later extra long brake pedal rod.
  After that it is a matter of plumbing the vacuum from the engine to  the 
brake booster.  Extending or completely redoing the metal brake  lines to work 
on the booster dual MC now set farther back on the front beam.  Mounting the 
upper reservoir either just under the stock fill opening or inside  the bus 
interior.
