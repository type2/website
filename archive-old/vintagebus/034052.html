Category:   Other Volkswagen  
Price:  $900.00  
This is a 1958 VW Pickup painted a primer brick/brown color with canopy bows 
on it. It runs, but needs the brakes replaced soon. Fun to drive and 
definitely an attention-getter. All the sides of the bed will go down flat 
like a flat bed. Not many of them made. I have pictures I can e-mail you if 
you're interested. Priced to sell immediately!
