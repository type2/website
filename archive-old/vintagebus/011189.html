 This is a big weekend for me. As I posted earlier, I have cut a quarter
 panel out of a donor bus. Last night, a friend told me he had brought a
 plasma cutter home for me to use. So tomorrow morning, I am gonna try to
 remove the bashed in quarter panel. This will not be an easy job, but
 one that must be done.
----------------------
Spot weld drill bit for precision removal?  measure twice, cut once.

 ..............
 But I also ran into a problem. I cannot get the drivers door open,
 either from the inside, the outside or, with the window open, a
 combination of the two. Any one have this problem before and can offer
 me suggestions??
 ---------------
remove interior panel enough to spray lots of penetrating oil at/in the door 
mechanism.

while inside bus, lift inner handle to 'open' door, and bash door hard with 
left shoulder.   Repeat.   Cuss.  In several languages.  Have a beer. Put 
your jacket on.   Bash door with shoulder again.
