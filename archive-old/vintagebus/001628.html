&gt;Our '65 has 76,000 miles on it's original, untouched engine. It runs great,
&gt;but I know that can only go on for so long. The compression is fine,
&gt;doesn't use oil.  What will go first? What should we keep track of to keep
&gt;a handle on the engines health? We have a trip to Newfounland and back for
&gt;this up-coming summer [CT here], probably about 3000 miles the way we
travel.

Your heads are long overdue to drop an exhaust valve. Wouldn't be a bad idea
to rebuild them, at least replace the exhaust valves, lap the intakes. Check
the crank endplay, replace the flywheel seal if'n you take the flywheel off
to reset it.. Don't do too much, though, old parts get used to each other.
Get persnickety when you show favoritism to one area over another.
