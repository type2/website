Your supposed to let the Fresno contingent get first 
crack Harry! I haven't looked at the classifieds yet.

Sheeesh!

Just for that I'm posting the fact that I have the fold-
down middle seat your looking for in my spare bedroom. 
It's a family couch right now.

--------------
It's metallic light blue with dark blue stripes, a Kombi 
or Std. with no 
bumpers. The guy will take less than the $1,700 it's 
listed for at 
www.fresnobee_dot_com. He used it to haul band equip., I 
remember seeing a lot of 
black carpet lining the interior. The PO had it cherried 
out, but the CO hasn't 
kept cosmetics up. Said it drives great, straight. 
That's all I know, here's his 
number,  559-229-8111

 -Harry in Fresno
