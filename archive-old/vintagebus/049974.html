Subject: Re: [VB] 6 v -&gt; 12 v

&gt;Was written:
&gt;
&gt;&gt;or change to an alternator stand and use a 12v generator or
&gt;alternator.  &lt;
&gt;
&gt;Caution here, if you change to an alternator, you will have to change the
&gt;fuel pump as well to the alternator type. Or as I did, a block off plate
&gt;and an electric fuel pump which is less expensive.


My 1200 Beetle has an alternator w/ the stock fuel pump (I think).  Is this
special alternator fuel pump only needed w/ 1500-1600 engines?
