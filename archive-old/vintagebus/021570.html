&gt;&gt;Anyone ever had this problem before?
I have a friend that had a bug with the same problem.  The engine was a stock 40-horse from an good engine builder in So Cal.  The cam rivets came loose after 13,000 miles.  It made a strange rattle but the engine seemed to run OK. 
You know the sound is &quot;not right&quot; when you hear it.  The noise goes away at medium to high revs.  I thought it might be a generator bearing but taking the fan belt off made no difference.  The noise was coming from inside the case but didn't sound like rod knock.  It was clear the case needed to be opened up.  
We found the John Muir Sounds website after the engine had been torn down and fixed.  If you've heard cam rivet noise before you can hear it in the Muir cam noise WAV file.   I wouldn't be able to pick out the rattle noise of the cam I hadn't heard it in a real engine.  I hear it now.  
Here's a link to Muir's noises:

'62 SO-34 Westy

PS - To make a long story short - the rebuild went well, he was happy, the car ran great, he drove it hard, drifted off the road into a storm drain,  rolled the car and totaled it!  He walked away unhurt but the '64 beetle was a total lose.
