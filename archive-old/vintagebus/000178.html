I know everyone will think this is funny.
The guy who posted that ad for the step is my friend. That was part of my 
gripe.
He knew that I was looking for one. And he just picked up a bus that had one 
on there.
He couldnt find my phone number ANYWHERE. So he posts the ad with some 
ridiculous price tag looking for me to contact him.
WELL IT WORKED!!!
haha, he calls me tonight laughing histeracally!!!!
Hope this puts a small end to this. 
No thom, this doesnt change my offer.
It still stands.

Fixed ambulance bus side step.

Has a little peddle that you push and it &quot;retracts&quot; out from under the bus.

Also optional for standards, deluxes, westys, whatever.

Am I insane thinking I was going to find one for around 200$ is very nice

condition?

&gt;

I've seen them for $150 over the past few years, working but needing resto.


My friend has one that was $50 (approx.) but they had to cut it open and

re-weld it to get it operational.


I know where one is right now, attached to a Bus, but I don't feel like

driving 20 hours to see if it's for sale.  :)
