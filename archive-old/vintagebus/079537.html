Couple of brake  questions (maybe a few)

67's had dual circuit brakes?
The dual circuit was added part way through the 67 model year.   If you look 
at you MC (under the drivers feet) the single circuit has a round reservoir on 
top of the master cylinder, the dual circuit has a dual reservoir


How many brake options were there for a 67 deluxe?

The only differences were part way through the year the MC changed... this 
means a few brake lines were different up front, but the wheel cylinders didn't 
change... same shoes etc.


If PO swapped  67 brakes and put them on his 63 or 4ish single cab, how 
could I ID them?
rear brake cylinders were the same 55-70.   if you have 46mm rear axle nuts, 
it has the 64-70 rear brakes.  if it has 36mm rear nuts, it probably had a 
tranny swap at some point and got the 55-63 rear brakes.   there was a 63 1 ton 
option with 36mm nuts but the wider 64-67 shoes, and unique '63 1 ton rear drums

The axle dust cap up front has a lip so it's easy to pry off with a claw 
hammer, it has the 64-67 (i.e., 1 ton) front brakes.  If no lip, the 3/4 ton 
(55-63 ) brakes.



Has two front wheel cylinders, what years does that rule out?

all 3/55-67 splitties have 2 wheel cylinders on each front wheel.  68-70 
also, then in 71 then went to disc brakes.    the barndoor (50- 2/55) buses have 
one per front wheel, and the brakes are pretty equivalent to that of a 68 bug 
in ability
