Subject: Re: [VB] should I feel bad or good

What weirds me out is when pictures of my cars in my yard that I didn't
submit turn up in a gallery.



&gt; FYI ; any photograph that is taken by a person can be copywritten by that
&gt; person Unless the subject or owner of the subject (given that the subject
is
&gt; not a copywritten object 1st) in the photograph has not given permission
to
&gt; have the photo taken.
&gt;
&gt; Has everyone who takes pics of VWs at kelly park or The bug jam ask the
&gt; owner first before they take the picture or post it to their web site.
there
&gt; is no difference in that than copying one off the web.
