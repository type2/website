&lt;&lt; There's one doohickey which hangs from the cargo doors.  The only other
 option is to get a late-model drive-away tent. &gt;&gt;

I thought about those things and do not want those, i want the doors to be 
able to stay fully open. in case you are swapping you can keep an eye on your 
goods. i guess i am looking for more of an awning rather than a tent. maybe 
home made is the way to go?
