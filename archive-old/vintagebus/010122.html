&gt;195 is a mystery, and seems often used  on 62s and 63.   wonder if it
apeared
&gt;on euro spec buses?

My recently acquired 61 Westy has M195. No clue from the bus as to what it
might be. Bus also has mystery M358. This seems to be a package including
six side pop-outs with wide-opening latches, and safari windscreens.

M-tag lists the SO23 westy kit as J23. What does J stand for? Does anyone
have a list of what A23, B23 etc, meant? This bus is RHD, meaning the camper
kit is mirror image to the LHD set-up.

I notice that this bus has Sekurit glass all round. Maybe this has something
to do with M195???
