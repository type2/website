Wow- you guys and gals are great.  I came home to a mail box full of offers.
By far, the offer I like best is the Vintagebus_dot_com one where we all can
easily enjoy the view.  Besides, I fully endorse Thom's site so anything I
can do to increase hits on his page is worth it in my book.

NQ

I'll post the URL in a few minutes.
