&gt; Is there anything to keep the back of the 2/3 front
&gt; seat anchored to the pedestal?

Maybe a dumb question.....

Is your 2/3 seat solid?  Or does it hinge in the middle?

Since you asked if there was a way anchor the back, it sounds like your seat
is hinged in the middle. If this is true, then you have a bay window 2/3
seat from a non-walk thru. The split bus 2/3 seat is a solid frame that
hinges at the front edge.
