Subject: Re: [VB] Gas heater in a '70

They might be gone, but check for the exhaust pipe for the heater. Also
check to get the fitting for the heater air intake in the engine compartment
floor.

&gt; &gt;I may have an oppurtunity to get the gas heater from a '70 bus. I want to
&gt; &gt;make sure I get it all. What parts are there that I need to make sure and
&gt; &gt;get off the bus so I can successfully install it into another bus.

&gt; You didn't mention which type of heater you are getting, but this should
&gt; cover both.
&gt;
&gt; When salvaging the heater, make sure you get:
&gt;
&gt; 1.  the main heater with mounts.
&gt; 2.  measure where the holes have been cut for the intake and exhaust
&gt; (cardboard template?)
&gt; 3.  take the gas tank cover tin that has been cut.
&gt; 4.  remove gas tank and get the duct beside the tank
&gt; 5.  make a template for where the gas tank duct comes into the passenger
&gt; compartment.
&gt; 6.  get the &quot;T&quot; fuel line fitting (you can get these at the hardware
store)
&gt; 7.  get the LOOOOOOONG lawn mower looking push pull cable with wires.
&gt; 8.  get the switch and pull knob attached to the cable.  (there may also
be
&gt; a timer)
