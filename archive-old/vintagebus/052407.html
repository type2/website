Subject: Re: [VB] Just how fast does your bus go??

ever noticed that for some drivers, no matter how fast you are going it's not fast enough?  i am so totally tired of people getting up my tail pipe because i'm in an old volkswagen and therefore must be going slow.

this morning while driving to work, going over about 20 miles of winding hills and tight curves with a posted speed limit of 50 mph, even doing 60-65 mph, i'd still get some fool trying to climb into my tail pipe.

i know my volkwagen's limits and i take it right to the edge but i'm crazy stupid like that.  perhaps those other drivers are the same....

anyway, i find driving my single cab quite a relaxing treat after driving my fast volkswagen and dealing with those (other?) crazies on the road.  i know my truck doesn't go so fast (60mph, 1600sp, late model trans) so i can just kick back in the right lane and be polite to the big rigs.

cheers,
Rachel, Monterey CA			http://www.stanford_dot_edu/~rahaha/pig.html
In a new car, you're just going somewhere;                                
in a Volkswagen you ARE somewhere. -Stormy Henderson's Dad
