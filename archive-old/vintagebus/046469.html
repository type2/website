Well I'll put in my $.02 here. The '70 westy is soon to have a new home. A 
happy couple from Hawaii plan to pick it up in July and drive to Costa Rica 
via Alaska. Now the 70 is a work of art in progress, all the heavy mechanical 
work is done and all that remains is the cosmetic work which mostly amounts 
to a little bodywork, paint and seat covers. All in all the very things a 
30yr old vehicle needs. 

The thing is, there are still a bunch of those little niggly things to be 
done and the price I tossed him was based on a done unit. They flew in last 
week to take a look and were bubblin over with enthusiasm. They were willing 
to overlook a bunch of things I wouldn't. We sat down and worked out a bill 
of sale that lined out the basics of what they would like to have done, and 
worse gave me a big enough deposit that will get me off my big rear and get 
the bus finished. 

Now I certainly hope they can get more than a few miles without a breakdown, 
this bus has been to Jerome and Havasu and has never given me a minute of 
trouble. It all breaks down to the golden rule, in our original emails I 
offered advice about the different years and personal reasons why I liked 
some over others and offered to help in their quest even if they didn't buy 
mine, a lot of exchanges were more like friends and now I feel I have a 
vested interest in makeing sure their trip is a success. I'm hoping they'll 
join the list and send trip updates. Now I'll have to get off my butt and 
start on the 69 ( anyone got a transvair kit out there?)

btw, at the end I was asked if this was where the bus was normally parked? 
Surprised I answer 'yes it is' and asked why, &lt;grin&gt; he asked where the oil 
spots were
