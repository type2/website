hi all,

Last night and the night before i got a lot done on my bus.

The night before, i just couldnt get the darned thing to idle :( so i
ripped the 34 pict 3 apart.  it has been sitting in my side cabinet of my
71 as a spare, and i knew it was good so i was confused.  When i pulled it
apart it was filled with brick red guck, looked like brick powder? i know
i havent filled my bus with ground up bricks, wierd.  Guess you have to
drain those flaot bowls when storing a carb... dont forget.

Also the night before i cleaned up all the connections in the charging
system.  The wires from the regulator to the generator were homemade and
had crappy ends.  the D+ wire was way too thin.. i had bought all the
proper connectors and had some 10 gague wire, so i made it all nice nice
and clean looking.  Put in a used bosch regulator instead of the generic
one i had.  I did all this because even though the gen light was going out
when running, it just wasnt charging the battery.  My theory was that the
electricity was getting to the car, but not back to the battery.. i also
replaced the end on the battery cable as it had some highly corroded brass
looking bent to heck bolt on end on there.  On the off chance that the
problem was polarity, i polarized the gen as well...

So anyway, i pulled it apart and cleaned it.  It ran better but the timing
was still jumpy... then i remebered i hadnt put on the M8 nut that holds
the dist to the case, DOH... realize its late go to bed...

So yesterday, i put on that nut... and started it up, abotu 20 minutes of
twiddling with the carbie, now it runs a treat.  Took one more run around
the block and up to the gas statin sans windshields for that wind in the
face experience and then decided to put in der windshields...

I dunno why everyone says this is so darned hard...  I used roofing tar
but just at the lower edge where it tends to rust and leak the most.
well, really it was called roofing cement, but i think its almost the same
thing... ingredients were asphalt, petroleum, and fiber and calcium
carbonate??

anyway, the passenger one i did alone, took about 10 minutes, the drivers
side one i had help from a neighbor who is an older hippie type, and that
one went in in about 3 minutes... I always use electrical wire to put in
seals, the kind with a plastic cover, keeps from cutting seals, maybe this
trick other people dont know?

Took my roof rack off my 71 and put it on my 61 singlehandedly (there are
some benefits to having rain gutters that are rusty instead of painted,
hehe)

So then, we go to drive to my friends house.  He's not there and the
clutch stops working right again.  When we get back (he wasnt home) i
adjust the clutch to the very end of the threaded area, now it works well
again, im guessing since 61 has a one year only clutch cable the one thats
in there isnt the right one and is too long.  Since i have the right one i
may put that in and use this one as a spare...  

Then i adjusted the shifter some more, i finally got it to work almost
right by twisting the base... pushed the base as far forward as it would
go, pushed the back edge to the passenger side, and the front edge to the
driver side, and now it works about 90% at least the reverse lockout works
which was my biggest concern...

Put on a front bumper... and went to bed. (1 am, wow time flies when you
are having fun)

got up this morning, blocked of my heater blower tubes, put in the cargo
area rubber mat, and got in to drive to work.

The trip to work was fun, i couldnt believe i was really driving it almost
exactly 2 months after bringing it home... the small nut transaxle maxes
out at 60 MPH... the scariest part of the ride was when a fighter jet flew
right over my head, i though it was something letting go on the bus in a
major way! hehe... now i have to get used to the sound of this bus... so
i'll know when its working right and when its not.  When something is
wrong with my 71 its sounds are so imprinted on me that i can tell right
away.

So, anyway, i am really excited... and happy.  And, if nothing
catastrophic happens, i may well make good on my pledge to drive this bus
to the dam campout at the end of this month :)

Now its on to interior and small stuff (camper bed, fixing inside panels,
fixing piddly things like bad engine lid hinges, driver door handle not
working 100%)

I hope to get it inspected today, assuming i can find a 12 volt horn to
throw in there, everything works except the horn is missing :)

more to come im sure...

take care,

Steve
