Hi Peter,

	I had the same problem in my E-Z Camper.  I located and installed two sets
of baywindow middle seat belts (since they are longer and work better with
my folding bed and non-walkthru rear-facing seat).  You can probably expect
to pay $10 - $25 per set for good ones in a wrecking yard.  Here's how I did
it since there was no stock mounts:

1.  I got grade 8 bolts w/ lock-washers &amp; nuts that were just as big as the
holes in the belt anchors.
2.  I made backing plates out of 1/8&quot; steel plate cut unto approx 4&quot; round
circles and drilled holes to match the bolts.
3.  I carefully marked/drilled my holes for the new belts.
4.  I had my wife hold the bolts from inside as I placed the backing plates,
lock washers and nuts on the underside.  You may have to heat the backing
plates for the rear seat with a torch and bend them to match the curve under
the seat.

	I've been fortunate that I've never hat to test them yet and hopefully
never will.  With the big, thick backing plates, I believe the retro fitted
belts would hold up much better than the stock ones up front.  Good Luck!!

I've just picked up a '64 Sundial camper and am itching to do some
traveling.  However, concerns for the family's safety does need to take
priority.  I've searched the archives and found limited info on the possible
options for installing rear seatbelts.  I can't seem to locate any plastic
plugs or other such things that might indicate a mounting point for the
belts. Navigating the belts around the fold out cot also seems to present a
problem.  The open roads are a callin', but I can't answer until I can belt
in the kids!  Any help is appreciated.
