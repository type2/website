Hi Y'all!
They're back!
Trip report to follow soon on the adventure Miami to Charleston run (with side
tour to Myrtle beach.  Anyway =&gt;

I use a floor jack.  I took a piece of 3/4 inch plywood, screwed 2x4s to make
space for the oil screen cover, and also to strengthen it.  It also helps to run
a BIG bolt through this (using many washers for added strength) that fits the
hole in my floor jack
Ascii art:

Anyway you get the idea..  Center the whole thing under the engine, jack up just
enough to take a wee bit o'the weight, doublecheck all connections severed,
unbolt and roll away!
