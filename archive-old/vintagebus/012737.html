Hi Erik,

I'm sorry to have taken so long to get back to you after your thorough
reply about possible accomodations in the Salzgitter area.  Believe it or=

not, we still haven't finalized a lot of our lodging plans for Europe yet=
,
although that should happen quickly.

Being a Bus nut (the President of the USA Split Bus Club NEATO) I like th=
e
sound of going to or being near a &quot;Bus Museum&quot;.  I have forwarded the inf=
o
you sent to our famous and fearless leader, Bill Collins of the &quot;Der Kafe=
r
Fahrer&quot; Vintage Club which is the Host Club of our &quot;Return to the
Fatherland '99 Tour&quot;.  =


Currently in the running for our choice of accomodations are the town of
Celle, your Salzgitter option and something in or around Wolfsburg itself=
. =

Celle and Salzgitter sound like they are about the same driving time away=

&gt;from our activities at Wolfsburg.  Right now, Bill has someone within VWA=
G
at WOB checking out a few lodging options very near to or in Wolfsburg. =

Probably not as scenic of touristy as Celle or perhaps Salzgitter (I've
never been there), but the proximity to the WOB plant is the advantage
there.  Since we will be in the Wolfsburg area for a special tour and a f=
ew
others diversions from Monday night or Tuesday morning through Thursday
morning, we'd prefer not to drive that two hour roundtrip to Wolfsburg ea=
ch
of those days.  That may not sound like that much to most folks, but by t=
he
time our Vintage tour reaches Wolfsburg, we will have driven over 5,000 t=
o
6,000 miles in mostly 25bhp powered, ancient VW's on roads with fast,
modern cars with a bunch of &quot;nuts&quot; behind their wheels.  No one wants to
add to the odds of getting clobbered by some moron out there.  We're
obviously not afraid to drive our old cars, but we also don't want to ask=

for trouble either!

We'll see what WOB turns up, and then look at all the options and then ma=
ke
a decision.  If we don't end up in Salzgitter for lodging, perhaps we mig=
ht
need to make a run out there to tour the Museum or dinner and drinks or f=
or
a party with the local VW Clubs or something?  We'll have some pretty
amazing old VW's with us for everyone to checkout.  We are a rolling
Vintage VW car show!  =


I noticed that you live in Braunschweig.  How far is that from Wolfsburg,=

35 minutes or so?  Is there anything scenic, reasonable and nice there in=

terms of lodging for us to consider?  Any other ideas even closer in to
Wolfsburg?  Thanks for any ideas!

By all mean, you are all invited to join onto our caravan from Wolfsburg
down to Bad Camberg!  It should be quite a sight!  We plan to form up and=

pull out of Wolfsburg sometime in the late morning hours of Thursday, Jun=
e
17th.  Please make plans to join the rolling party!  We haven't selected =
a
route yet, so were open to suggestion.  The best combination of safe road=
s
and scenic / touristy driving is what we'd prefer.  Remember, these are
25bhp motors and while we're not afraid of hills, we won't be climbing an=
y
too fast.  On basically flat terain our top, our sustainable speeds for t=
he
&quot;core&quot; Vintage Der Kafer Farher group will be 55-60mph.  So if you have a=
ny
ideas on a driving route, we'd love to hear 'em. =


Well, time to get back to work.  See you soon,

Bill Bowman
