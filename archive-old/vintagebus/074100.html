Subject: steering gear box lube

after the trip to Yakima I decided I'd do a really thorough service on the bus.    Tune up all went normal, then I pumped grease through the myriad grease points, including the one for the forward end of the drag link, where you have to pull up the floor mat, and the clutch pivot as well as the torsion tube and swing lever and spindles and the one old style tie rod.  checked the links, which were fine.   I decided to change the steeringbox oil out, and put in the grease mix.  It has been dripping, you see.  and I don't like the gear oil spot on the garage floor.

so I pull out the 4 10mm headed bolts and nice clean gear oil dripped out.  Checking my records, it had been a couple years ago I drained the old nasty stuff out and put clean gear oil in.  I had cleaned out a mustard squeeze bottle with tapered point, and caught the nice clean oil in it.   Seemed only a cup.   Then later added as much grease to it, and stirred well with a long screwdriver.   After reattaching the bottom plate on the SGBox, and undoing the 8mm square headed fill plug,   I squeezed this goop into the box.   not sure how much it took, part way through I mixed up some more oil/grease mix, a tad more oil than grease this time, and squeezed more in.   I think that at least half the oil had slowly dripped away, as I put much more in that came out!  wiggled the wheel some to settle the goop and filled it some more.  topped up with gear oil till over flowing, inserted plug, and wiggled wheel well to mix up the oil and goop.  

 Then I filled the rebuildt box that is going into the 65 shortly as well.  easier to fill when it's not in the bus!  It's a funny angle.

Hope this stops the drips!
