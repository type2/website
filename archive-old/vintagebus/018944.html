You don't know how right you are...

(Here goes another wildly unpopular piece)

In all honesty, it is becoming more and more impractical to
use an ACVW for utilitarian purposes.  Yes, it's still possible
to maintain a bus for errands and home depot runs, but think
about the issues involved: what happens if it gets wrecked?
Stolen?  Parts wear out?  They're just not as easy to repair
as a late-model truck, both in terms of finding someone who
can or will do good body work on a 40 year-old car, and in
terms of finding pieces.  

There was someone on the list who wanted a double-door panel,
ostensibly for a furniture business.  Other than for decorative or
novelty purposes, that would not make sense.  The cost to aquire,
bring up to an operable status, and maintain such a vehicle
does not seem cost effective for a real business - otherwise
they'd all be doing it!  Can a VW bus compete with one of the 
low-end small bobtail trucks popular with the light delivery
industry?

Yeah, yeah, yeah - I know - you know someone who's still running 
a '54 pickup for a fertilizer hauling biz yada yada yada - there's 
exceptions to every case.  But in terms of reliabiltity, accessibilty 
to parts, insurance and capacity, the VW commerical is past it's 
prime for most industries.

Then again, if you're a VW fan, would you *want* to use a VW bus/truck 
commerically?  Would you want it to get banged up, run the risks of 
collisions, clumsy forklift drivers, and all the other perils of everyday life.  
And when you *did* have an incident, just imagine the hassles with
trying to get the insurance company to put the car right again.

As far as personal transportation, it's already been stated many
times over that a lot of ACVW enthusiasts prefer to get &quot;disposable&quot; cars.
I consider my 911 disposable; if it got creamed by a soccer mom, I know
I could get another one in fairly short order, and it wouldn't be that
great of a loss for the automotive world in general.  I can't quite say
the same for my '54 deluxe...

With the parts supply dwindling, and the parts available 
mostly coming from 3rd world suppliers who haven't the 
slightest clue - or care - what the parts are supposed to look like,
it makes it that much more difficult to justify running an older
car on a daily basis.

And it's not necessarily the *price* of the parts, but the availabilty.
Sure, you can still get 36hp fuel pumps for ~$50, but for how long?
Do you really want to have your daily car &quot;down&quot; while you wait
for one to come up on ebay?

There's still a contingent that will drive their ACVW's every day, and
that's fine.  But don't be surprised as that number shrinks as time goes by.  

I still like buses, but I've come to the realization that have a different
place now in the automotive food chain, and are no longer the 
one-size-fits-all solution that they once were.  Just like the aging
sports hero who must one day retire and sit and watch from the sidelines, 
so must the bus.  While he can still play a friendly pickup game with friends, but
has seen his last olympics/super bowl/world series (etc).

&gt; I got into VW's because they were easy to rebuild

&gt; that me is drawing to a close 
&gt; and the car is becoming a hobby 
&gt; with out utilitarian purpose.
