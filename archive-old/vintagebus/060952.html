Subject: RE: [VB] engine sound control 

&gt; Gee, didn't VW put the sound deadening stuff on the interior (i.e. people
&gt; side) surfaces of the bus around the engine compartment?  I would think this
&gt; would be a better place than trying to put it *in* the engine compartment.

Actually vw put sound control boards IN the engine compartment. I know it
was there at least from 68-69 maybe earlier. Only in the higher end busses
though not kombis or panels.
