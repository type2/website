Subject: RE:  Interior Panel patterns
Date: Fri, 20 Nov 1998 14:11:51 -0600

&gt;Would anyone be willing to make some patterns for me of the door 
&gt;panels, kick panels and possibly the roof panels?  I want to redo the 
&gt;interior of Sparky ('60 Panel) and being the poor teacher that I am do 
&gt;not want to fork out the bucks, if there is a possibility of doing it 
&gt;myself.  Anyone have any tips for me?

I had the same predicament earlier this year with my 58 s.c.  It came
with no door or kick panels and I coudn't spare the $$$ for a set (I'm a
cheap bastard when it comes down to it).  Besides, I really like the
wooden panels in my 73 Westy so I wanted something similar in the truck.
After asking around for months trying to find some ragged-out panels to
use as patterns with no offers, I finally just jumped in with both feet.

I used some pages of my wife's artist's sketch paper to make my own
patterns.  The paper is thick, but not as thick as poster board and the
neat thing about it that when you make indentions with your thumbnail,
they stay there!  So I taped a few pages together (each sheet is only
about 20&quot;x24&quot;) and attached them to my doors/kick panels areas with a
few screws and made an outline of where to cut by indenting the paper.  

The hardest part was the cutouts for the headlight buckets - I just
kinda free-formed that one, making the cutout bigger and bigger until I
got it right.

And once you get one side done, the other is just a mirror image (minus
the cutouts for the fuse panel and speedo cable of course).

Final results were pretty nice.  A few jagged cuts here and there, but
that was probably more due to the quantity of beer I was consuming that
evening.  I figured I'd get some OK panels and then maybe make another
set next year, using the current ones as patterns and correcting
mistakes as I went.  

I used some wood panels from Home Depot called &quot;luanne doorskin&quot; or some
such.  Cost about $7 each for a 3' by 7' piece.  After I had them cut
and pretty close to ready, I soaked a towel in really hot water and laid
it on the panels where they needed to bend.  Let them get nice and damp,
wiped off the excess, then screwed them into place and let them dry that
way before removing them to sand and stain.

My headliner panels were still there, but were so brittle they crumbled
as I removed them.  I was able to use bits and pieces to form a pattern,
but I missed that one and cut it too narrow by about 1&quot; in the center.
Oh well, I'll re-make it one of these days.  In the mean time, I've got
some pretty decent looking wood panels in there for a whopping $25 (wood
+ stain + sand paper + saw blades).  Took me about 4 hours total.
