Here's what I did. My first Type 2 was a 1960 DC. Totally stock except
for rocker rot and some rollover damage on the driver's side.  Being my
first, I drove it around, enjoyed the altitude above my '74 Thing and
'7x Valient. Decided that the safety of better brakes and a freeway
flyer is better for me, I investigated the upgrades necessary, both in
cost and damage to a stock vehicle. then. Shopped and found a '65 DC
with ball joints, front disc brakes, brake booster and *#_at_($_at_#)($ CV
joints in the back instead of *#$)_at_#$)_at_ reduction boxes. Sure, I can
manage an upper body restoration, and the lower seemed a solid resto
&gt;from the Sacramento area, so the '60 went to someone who would restore
it, and the '64 went into a body shop. A '65 deluxe fell into my hands.
I have a road worthy truck, and my wife will enjoy a stock, vintage bus,
so a 21 window rotting down the street will be saved to be a holiday
vehicle financed by the money I didn't spend on a mid sized truck.
Point?  Keep them out of the crusher, do what you can and pass it on if
you can't. I see splits I can't save from the salvage yards and get what
I can from them. A lot of them end up in some mad welder's hands, but
they're on the road, and after the shine is gone, end up near the front
of the salvage yards. Do what you can where you are. Popout hardware in
a drawer,  door stashed in an attic, a clip in the rafters, a barnyard
full of busses. We'll get to it. Print up some splittie pics and post
them at the junkyards, pay a few fins for leads. Beat the evil butchers
to the goodies if that's your worst fears.
