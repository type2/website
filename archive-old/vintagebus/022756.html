Absolutely.  There are so many beat-down buses cruising the streets around
Nor Cal that it's not funny.  And some are beat-down on purpose: I've seen
many a nice, original paint bus that's been stripped and primed and left to
rust, then the stinger and stickers go on, it gets slammed, and now it's a
cool ride.  The trend seems to be to un-restore cars.

Unfortunately for NorCal most of the decent stuff got shipped out by a
voracious crowd of exporters.  What didn't get shipped got stripped and
primered, with just a few notable exceptions.

California shows differ significantly from AZ shows I guess.  I've never
heard of someone duct-taping a clapped out bus and limping it to Kelly Park.

To each his own, I guess.  I just don't see the glory in rolling a POS 350+
miles to a show.

&gt;Your right about 80% of the buses on the road, but that is about the same % 
&gt;you'll find anywhere. When we were in Nor-Cal we noticed an amazing number
of 
&gt;Cal look beaters.
