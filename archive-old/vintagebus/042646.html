&gt; well volks...I think I found a burnt piston.
&gt; The shop that the guy took it to to have it timed and tuned up etc... I

&gt; says...because &quot;it ran best there&quot;.  On an upright motor?? who's he
&gt; kidding??
Hi isaaiah,

If 27 BTDC was at idle, then he was definitely on the crack rock.. BUT if
he timed it to 27BTDC at full advance, that is actually a quite
conservative setting, 28 is wht i set mine at.

So, even though one has the timing number, unless one knows if that was at
idle or full advnace that doesnt tell the whole story, if indeed at full
advance they may still have recourse with mof*kyou

take care,

Steve
