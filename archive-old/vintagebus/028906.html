Subject: MAKING a pertronix fit in a 019

This is not for vintage nazis, nor the faint of heart...

I'm trying to make a 019 dizzy work in my new engine (BTW, the flywheel
came in today, so hopefully I'll have it together and in my bus
tomorrow)... Just for reference, I found another 019, in an old rusty
engine outside. It looks like an old 36 or 40 horse motor (round fan
shroud)...

I had to trim the cap latches and cut a notch in the body, and it fits a
009 cap perfectly. The rotor is at the same height above the body as a
009, so there's no problem there. I finessed the points plate from a 009
into the 019 (that took some cutting and bending and tweaking), so now I
have a plate that the pertronix will mount to, and everything is moving
freely, as it should be.

Here's the catch. A 009 plate sits deeper than a 019 plate, so there
isn't room for the pertronix. SO, I've trimmed the rotor and the magnet
plate that comes with the pertronix, trying to make it all fit...

This means, I'll have to carry modified spare parts. Maybe this is
getting stupid now, but I'm pretty stubborn, and I'm gonna make this
work...
