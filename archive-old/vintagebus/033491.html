Subject: Compufire failed

It's a 2 year old Compufire high voltage coil that failed, blowing out 
fuses in the doublecab.  It also blew out the distributor module when it 
failed. In went a brand new 009 that I won at an OCTO raffle and a new 
looking &quot;Made In USA&quot; coil from a misc. engine out back. Now the impossible 
task of digging up the invoice and seeing about a warranty period.
Had a nice trip to the central coast of Calfornia. Sighted about 7 splittys 
in 2 days including a rusty ~'60 doubecab in Cambria for sale, $4,500. I 
didn't take down the phone number. White with no back seat and later 
tailgate. Others included an 13 window deluxe in Morro Bay, an early 60's 
single cab and another doublecab blasting toward the beach with surfboards 
in the back. Tried to find Mark and no-name but didn't quite meet.

p.s. Central California Volks Folks are meeting Monday evening in Clovis.
