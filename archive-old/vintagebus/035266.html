&lt;It has has some kind of accessory oil cooler mounted behind the fan
shroud and a full flow oil filter which flows from that via hoses around to
sit near the left side of the carb then back. I've never seen this
configuration(?) but then that isn't saying much.&gt;
 
yeah basically what you have is an oil heater.When you remove the engine
install a later shroud and off set cooler.This will work much betterthan our
present arrangement.

&lt;&lt;Anybody have any thoughts or suggestions. All the mechanics around say a
minimum of $1000 to replace/rebuild the tranny. I think I could R/R it, but
the reduction gear boxes scare me.  Any input will be
greatly appreciated on or off the list.&gt;&gt;

 you an get a rebuilt,box to box and end to end  from a reputable rebuilder
such as Rancho or Carters for about 650.00 plus 150.00 to ship.

&lt;&lt;&lt;Should I part it out?&gt;&gt;&gt;No NO NO,sounds like a solid bus.Save it if you
can.Busses are disappearing every day do to sentamint such as this,don't let
another slip away.
