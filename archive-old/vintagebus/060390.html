Subject: repairing a westy tent

I have been given a 70's era freestanding westy tent (orangey-yellow and
blue, I believe).  It is in very good condition except that one of the
little plastic loops for attaching the floor to the ground has popped off.
These are plastic loops glued on to the canvas with a suction-cup looking
thing.  Is this fixable? recommendations on type of glue?  I was thinking it
might be better to install a grommet through the canvas at that spot, as I
suspect no matter what I do it will come off again when I put it up in high
wind conditions in the desert.
thanks in advance,
Diana
