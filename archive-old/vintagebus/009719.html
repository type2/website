Hello,
I just subscribed. I've been stumbling around looking for a particular 'm
code' I went to strictly vintage where they have the de-coder. They have no
match for  195.  I'm dealing with a 1963 double cab.
Here is the full set of codes:
362= prep for u s mkt
195= no match found
216= 1500cc engine
620= 12 volt electrical   ( can you believe that? )
621= 12 volt hazard warning lights

ul= poe  St Louis
2653    white    1070282
Where in that is the interior color?
Also, on the reduction boxes I found this #  211501236B  S  W&amp;E
I've heard the boxes for trucks are different to those of the busses.
Anybody know this stuff????
