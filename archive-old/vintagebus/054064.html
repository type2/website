Subject: Re: [VB] Stolen Crew Cab - Orange County CA.


it shows how smart theives are, of all things a camo 
colored bus. I really hope you find your bus!!
i really do recommend a locking shifter, its a small 
price to pay. But its better than losing your pride ans 
joy.

&gt; Yah i slapped it up on the front page of my site a few days ago. I figure
&gt; the sooner and more noticeable to everyone, the better. Another week and it
&gt; will prolly be gone for good unfortunately or at least painted a different
&gt; color.  from Randy: &quot;I got a tip that it was seen at Orangethorpe and Lemon
&gt; (near EMPI) in Anaheim.&quot;
&gt; Shows how dumb thieves are if the guy is drivin it around with the same
&gt; paint scheme.
&gt; I figure the internet should make it easier to catch stolen buses, or at
&gt; least I hope so. Did he send out an old picture tho? I can't make out the
&gt; safaris..

&gt; &gt;Hi all,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;Just had someone send me an email about a stolen Crew Cab in Orange County.
&gt; &gt;It's got a camoflauge paint scheme and safari's, so it shouldn't be THAT
&gt; &gt;hard to spot.
