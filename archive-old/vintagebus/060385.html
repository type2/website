Tom-
Glad to hear your brake shoe adjustment was successful.
Now you have all day Saturday to complete the maintenance
schedule Clara was so gracious to provide, at your convenience.
Plan on the disassemble of all four wheels for examination and to
get familair with parts for later replacement.
As you said, you wouldn't want to make a stupid mistake
that could damage your ride. We are all anxiously waiting for
your report, ( as we all travel the same roads as you :)
Dave \X/
