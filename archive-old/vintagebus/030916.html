the shroud must work WITH the flaps to work properly.


hmm,, what is properly? I guess that is a personal preference thing,, 
I know from many miles of experience,, the flaps are not needed in CANADA,, 
If you think about that, it will screw with your mind
We are COLDer climate in Canada,comparitivly speaking in regards to Southern
States, and you would think that the engine would never warm up. But It does
In a hot , dry climate, the engine will warm up quicker which is better,

Removing or holding the flaps open only delays the warm up time of the engine,,
thus maybe causing condensation in the oil,, if you are in a wet climate AND
only drive a short distance. Too short for the oil to warm up.. ie 2 miles to
the store and back. 
It will also have poor emmisions while it is warming up ,, neither are that
detrimental to the ACVW engine

Condensation in the oil means poor lubrication, and more frequent oil
changes,,,The oils have gotten significantly better over the years and we change
it every 3k miles anyways right?
I have never had condensation in the oil in an ACVW

Anyways,, what I am trying to say,, Some folks think that if the flaps are
disabled,or removed, that the engine will overheat, or disintigrate,,, neither
are true
some folks think that they should not drive a ACVW with out the flaps,,, not
true,

I don't care either way,, If it is working, then I use the stock system,, but I
don't loose any sleep from driving an engine without the flaps
working,,,especially If i know they are not stuck closed,,and better if I know
they are stuck open or removed,, YMMV 

From a guy who has run engines with the flaps removed on purpose,, for more
cooling of OffRoad racing engines, driven at wide open throttle for 2 hrs.the
flaps are a restriction and do reduce the air flow,, albiet such a tiny
amount... Drag raced engines with NO air shrouds!... and driven 100k + on the
street with NO airflaps.. long trips, short trips.. come to think about it,, the
airplanes do not have any FAN... or flaps or thermostat.. but that is diferent I
guess, with all that cold free air!
 
the ACVW engine can be modified,, somethings are good for one application but
NOT good in a bus,, But the airflaps seems to me to be a non issue

I am confooosed by all the talk about thermostats wide open,, your engine will
not overheat caused by tooo much cooling air,  I could understand if the folks
in the colder climates were worried about oil degredation caused by poor engine
warm up.... 

Now, if the flaps caused poor oil conditions,, wouldn't we see alot of crank
failures? Bearings that have poor oil tend to wear out, spin, seize, and cause
bottem end problems,, 
You can't say that working flaps and Tstats cause overheating,, and *I* don't
think that they add cold air

Why are top ends failing,,  #3 Exhaust has been notorious for years for failure
due to the wise engineeers at VW... same guys you put all your faith in for the
flaps design,,,

What I want to know,, Is WHY were there so many hot engines leaving EveryBus,,
What I am trying to put my finger on is WHY are they cylinder head temps going
up!
What is in the Fuel today that causes head failure??  THAT IS MY question!

I think that todays fuel has an additive to meet emmisions,, it makes the head
and combustion chamber hot!
I think we should worry more about detuning the timing and air/fuel to make the
ACVW live longer , than worrying about toooo much cooling air getting to the
cylinders before it is warmed up by a thermostat..
That is my story,, and so far,,, I am  sticking to it!

just my rant,,  about a nickel canadian,, so it adds up to your 2  cents!
Thanks!
