Subject: Re: [VB]  solid tow hitches and towing question

&lt;&lt;You need to leave the front wheels free if you want the bus to follow
you around curves.&gt;&gt;

Correct me if I am wrong, but I don't think this is correct. . . I think
the steering wheel needs to be tied.

I had a &quot;60 vw bug. Certainly, the favorite car I ever owned. When I
tried to tow it, I left the steering untied and, going around a corner,
the wheel spun and it wrench the whole front end. What a disgusting
sight. . . still turns my stomach thinkin about it thirty (???!!!) years
later.

I guess thats the reason I prefer a tow dolly that gets the front wheels
off the ground or, better yet, a nice flatbed trailor. The little bit of
extra cash it takes is well worth the piece of mind. And I am real
cheap, er ah. . . frugal.
