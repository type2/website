Subject: Middle seat part needed
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

Hi folks. I've got a standard 62 Kombi I recently purchased without the 
middle and rear seats. I found some in a junk 62 near me, but the middle seat 
has a rusted out backrest spring assembly for the 2/3 section. Does anyone 
have one of these by any chance? Are they interchangeable with the ones from 
a later model? I may be able to find one of those if so- but these early 
seats are impossible to find in any shape here. Thanks everyone!
