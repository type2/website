&gt;why are yours steel?

My porsche 901 transaxle has steel synchro rings , as well as synchro teeth
and operating sleeves. The needle bearings and roller bearings are steel as well.
The rings are actually made from unobtanium ( and upholstered by Moly B. Denum ).
once the rough textured coating  ( molybdenum ) wears off, they lose their grip and gears grind.
The advantage in this transaxle is  5 gears, the wide selection of optional gear sets and R/P sets
as well as the ability to take a lot of horsepower .
