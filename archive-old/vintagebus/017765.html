I have a hard time believing a slammed bus would ride like a 
full size 'merkin car when it has only a few inches (4?) of 
suspension travel.  There's just no where for it to go when
you encounter pavement anomalies.  In order to keep the car
from reaching either end of the suspension travel too often
and too quickly, one must dramatically increase the spring
rate.  Increased spring rate results in a harsh ride.

If such a thing was the norm, then why would car makers &quot;waste&quot;
so much on suspension?

Please enlighten me, or provide a re-defintion of &quot;nice ride&quot;
