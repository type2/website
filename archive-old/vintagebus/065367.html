Subject: re: [VB] Screen Print Woes?

If using MS Windows OS (regardless of which one) use Ctrl key and Print
Screen/Sys Rq key to capture entire screen. To capture only active window press
Alt key plus the Screen/Sys Rq key.

Open the Start/Accessories/Imaging utility and Crtl V to &quot;paste&quot; the image into
that utility program. Even if you arent using the latest WinOS that has the
Imaging utility you should have something similar to it in Win95 and Win98.

Pasting/(import image) into MS Word, Powerpoint, Adobe Photoshop etc. are other
options.

Past that I totally agree that there are many great shareware/freeware options.
Use whatever fits your needs. My point is simply that the ctrl printscreen and
alt printscreen are two inherent WIN OS capturing methods available to
everyone.

For Mac/LINUX users: Please provide me with a fully maxed out titanium laptop
so I can learn methods in a more natural environment. Pmail me for my snail
mail if willing to comply with my request.
Happy New Year to everyone.
