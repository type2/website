Doh!

What an idiot I am!  Sorry!  Here's the revised link:

original message:

Hey y'all...

It's been frustrating, doing this bus-fixin' thing, especially since I was
supposed to be done by September, but I know I'll love it when it's done!  I
slapped together a few web pages so I could offer curious peoples a heavily
edited view of what I've been doing....the pages each have six pics on each,
and are rather sloppy...let's assume, for my sake, that my bodywork is
better than my web page work...!

Let me know what you think...

Gene



p.s.  Sorry about the impersonal nature of this email, it couldn't be
helped!  (Time, y'know?)
