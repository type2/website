Forgot to mention that these were only $16.99 each. What a deal!

&gt; What did they charge for this beauty?
&gt;
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Now this tops it all! I'm in a ranting kind of mood today. You
don't
&gt; see
&gt;  ACVW's on our roads often you know but what's been following me around
&gt;  lately is something out of this world. Listen to this. I went by a
Wall-Mart
&gt;  today without even stooping since I was a bit pressed on time but I had
to
&gt;  go to Menards, for those that don't know this is a &quot;Home Improvement
Center&quot;
&gt;  store (drywall, nuts and bolts, lumber, tools etc, etc.) and guess
what???
&gt;  they have this
