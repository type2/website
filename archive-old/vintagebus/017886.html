I know its not friday, but I'll be away from the
computer this weekend.  I saw the new flick  &quot;Almost
Famous&quot; last sunday. If you havn't allready, go and
see it! It has a bus in just about every scene! There
were TONS! It also has a good story line that won't
leave you sleeping.  Anyone from the list have a bus
in the movie? Anyone going to Vegas this weekend? Look
for the shiny blue bus.  Anyways, have a good weekend
everyone.
