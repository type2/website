Hi Ronnie,
Yes, it uses exactly the same amount of cooling air since we do not modify 
either the scoop inside of the fan shroud that directs the air to the cooler, 
and we keep the exaust tube the same size as before.  We were worried about 
robbing the cylinders of cooling air if we altered either the scoop or exaust 
size.  Instead we are relying on the air slowing down a tad due to the larger 
area inside the cooler.  This allows the air just a little more time to 
conduct the heat out of the cooler.  Plus air dropping in pressure actually 
cools better, and of course the larger surface area offered by the cooler 
allows for both more oil to metal to air cooling contact.
  We look forward to hearing what you find about the diesection of the 
coolers.  Thanks for the interesting info about the T4 oil passages.  We have 
not gotten elbow deep into one of those yet.   :)    Eric&amp;Barb
