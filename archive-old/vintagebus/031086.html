I started out with a bay, as many others have, and eventually
&quot;graduated&quot; to a splitty. By that time, I'd collected enough tools and
friends and experience to handle most situations... I've changed a few
engines on the side of the road, which I was never prepared to do when I
owned a bay... I wouldn't say that a splitty is more reliable than a
bay, but it's a heckuva lot easier to fix in a pinch...
