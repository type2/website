Matt,

&gt; Some random thoughts...

&gt; This would make more sense to me if #3/#4 or #1/#2 were broken (left or
&gt; right half of the engine) rather than #2 and #4 (*back* half of the
&gt; engine).

Yeah, that's the puzzler end of it.  It's definitely #2 and #4 though.

&lt;snip&gt;

&gt;  Beyond that I'd wonder if there is a
&gt; problem where the manifold seals to the head, or possibly a crack in the
&gt; intake manifold - either problem would allow extra air in and lean out
&gt; the mixture.

That's my thinking at this point - a bad seating of the manifold.  I'm 
pretty sure the carb to manifold is ok, so I suspect it's the manifold to 
head...

&gt; Another possible problem is that the air+fuel is getting into the
&gt; cylinders just fine, but can't get out for some reason, like the exhaust
&gt; is restricted... &lt;snip&gt;

INTERESTING!  I hadn't thought about it from this angle.  I'll keep this 
in mind if the manifold isn't the issue...

Thanks for taking the time to respond...

cheers,
      tom
