Subject: Re: [VB] need for freeway flyer?

Jason,

I used to drive from L.A. to Sunnyvale and back on holidays when I was in
college (in the bus). I still do the drive from time to time as my daughter
is at Cal Poly. I don't drive the bus much anymore. I just had it restored
and I installed a 1776cc with a freeway flier. It only has 200 miles on it
(in a year and a half) and I am having some problems with the dizzy and the
carb so until that is fixed, I won't be driving on the freeway. I did get it
up on the freeway a couple of times for a couple of exits but not enough to
evaluate the flier.  From conversations with others, I think that the flier
tranees are a good idea if you have an engine larger than 1600. I chose a
3.875 ring and pinion that only changes the gear ratio about 6%. Not a lot.
I also installed the widest fan that is available, I think 35mm. The larger
engine may require that 3rd and 4th be welded(I had mine done that way). I
would talk to a tranee house to find that answer. Try Rancho or
Transmissions West. Look up the posts from Ronnie at Old Volks. He chimes in
on the list from time to time and has done extensive work with the various
gear ratio's available. He drive a bus long distances to all the VW events
here in So.Cal. so he has a lot of experience.

Chris

&gt; Are you a local boy, or do you just know the area?
&gt;
&gt; From your email, it sounds like I don't need to bother with modifying
&gt; the tranny or getting a freeway flyer. Is that correct? I plan to put a
&gt; bigger engine in it this year; will that necessitate doing anything
&gt; transmission-wise?
