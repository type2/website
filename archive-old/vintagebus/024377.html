Here is the prefect solution to all of the tire delemas....buy new
6.40-`15 Bias plys. These can be easily found at Cooker tires...I bought
the Firestones....love 'em  they are a 4 ply rated sidewall (which is
what 3/4 ton buses required according to my Official VW Workshop
manual). That is 4 plys polyester on sidewall and tread.  They are the
correct width and heighth...so you can actually drive 55 without running
4,000 ++ rpm.  They ride is smooth as cream...you will never get any
radial to give you that correct feel a bias-ply will.  Remember that the
early bus had a suspension designed for Bias-ply tires.  They ride
extremely well,... far better then any Radial tire, re-inforced or not
that I have used on nearly 40 splits in the past 10+ years.  

Down side is they ain't cheap and don't come close to lasting as long as
radials.  But, they do ride much better and believe it or not handle
better do to the extremely stiff sidewalls.  Plus they give your bus
that correct vintage look!

I have been thru this thread millions of times before and have never
come up with a correctly rated Radial tire that would come close to the
correct size for the stock 15&quot; bus rim.  Until someone can make a
Re-inforced radial that is very thin and extremely tall, the original
size 6.40-15&quot; Bias tire as the only way to go.
