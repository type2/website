Subject: Gas Tank Cleaning

I'm catching up on digests so this may be late for whomever was
interested.

Back in June, I took the tank for my '63 bus to a shop in Reno which was
recommended to me by the local (Truckee) VW repair place.  It cost me
$85 for them to clean it. I had my engine out and was doing a bunch of
stuff, went on vacation etc. so I didn't get around to trying the tank
out until August when I found out the tank was leaking.  Since the
cleaning was done in June, they refused to refund the money.   It didn't
leak before they cleaned it so obviously whatever they did caused some
erosion or something.

You can buy a brand new tank for about the same and know that it won't
leak.

Mike
