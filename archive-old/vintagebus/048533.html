Greg, let me get this straight, you're taking a double door EZ camper and
turning it back into a panel?  That seems a bit strange, there are plenty
of DD panels around, but how many EZ double doors?  Are you just pulling
our legs?  If you're serious, I'll get you a DD in trade for your camper!!
It would be much less work.


&gt;Well, I picked up the free EZ camper this weekend, and I am very happy
&gt;with it. Took the dog (Great
&gt;Dane) for a ride and he liked it and had room too. So I'm going to leave
&gt;the camper interior in it
&gt;for now, but I want to make it back into a Panel and get rid of those
&gt;funky windows. So I'm looking
&gt;for 2 sets (it's a DD) of clean (rust free &amp; fairly straight) Panel cargo
&gt;doors. Velvet green would
&gt;be nice, but I'm not too picky.
&gt;
&gt;Greg
