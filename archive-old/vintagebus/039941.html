With all due respect I think the list needs to stop promoting this idea that 
the word &quot;hippies&quot; means bad, evil, worthless things.  Pops up alot around 
here and seems to miss the original intent.  Yes, language evolves or 
devolves but we don't have to buy into it. Think we need to chill on this 
lest we fall into the same rampant bigotry that seems to plague use in 
general.  Bus content?  So what is the &quot;correct&quot; association for buses?

&gt;This is not a family event... for the yuppies to go and play hippie&quot;.  &gt;... 
&gt;Too many people associate splitties with hippies all ready.
