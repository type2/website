Does anyone know if you can transfer the thermostat and flaps and all the
control stuff from a '65 engine to a dog house cooler fan housing?  thanks,

I believe the flaps will switch over, but definately the horizontal rod will 
not.  The vertical rod, thermostat bracket, and thermostat are the same.   
The non dog style uses a horizontal rod  that attached to all flaps, the dog 
house style has an intermediate bit on each side.  Same return spring.
