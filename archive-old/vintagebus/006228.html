I did it years ago with 12 volt lights.  As I remember they were originally
set up to run off battery packs and I changed the bulbs with ones for the
proper voltage.  Found all the stuff at the local Eckert drugs here in St.
Petersburg, FL.

Also -- I lit a small tree (3&quot;) and had it on the sink/icebox unit of my
camper and hung lighted garlands all the way around the inside -- looked
like a moving living room having Christmas.  It was a lot of fun and got a
lot of attention.

Always planned to add a lighted wreath to the front bumper, but never got
around to it...

Subject: [VB] Christmas lights on bus


&gt; Has anyone put Christmas lights on their bus with any success?  I would
&gt; love to install some this season and maybe put together a Christmas light
&gt; cruise.
&gt;
&gt; I know I have seen semi's with multiple lights, but not really Christmas
&gt; lights.  I have attended one lighted Christmas parade, but the vehicles
&gt; were moving very slow, I would like to be able to drive highway speeds
with
&gt; the lights on.
&gt;
&gt; If you have any suggestions as to where to buy the lights (I heard there
&gt; are 12 volt ones made, but don't know where to get them), or how to
install
&gt; them, please let me know.
&gt;
&gt; Thank you.
