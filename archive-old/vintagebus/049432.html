Subject: [VB] Battery Cover

...
&gt;I am in the process of converting my 1959 back to 6V from a poorly done
12V conversion. Would the Interstate 19L-50 battery be the correct physical
size for a 59?
&gt;
&gt;I believe I have an Interstate 19L, it fits the cover and strap perfectly.
 &gt;The other one close in size is too tall.

&gt;Also, were there different size battery covers for the 6V batteries?
&gt;
&gt;I've only seen 1 6v size cover.

I'm no expert on these things, but there were 2 sizes of battery covers.  A
friend of mine scored 3 of the old 6V battery covers at the show in Eureka
Springs, AR.  Upoon examining the thins, hge noticed that 1 was almost
square instead of being rectangular.  It had a VW part number, and after
showing it to a few other VW gurus, it was decided that it was an early
(early '50s???) battery cover.  Just thought that might be of some
interest.
