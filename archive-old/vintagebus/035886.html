Hi Matt, you wrote:


Can any tell me how the middle seat (full w/ 1/3 fold down) ash tray on
the back of the seat was attached?  Was it just rivited thru the seat
material?  Did it have any type of backing?  I am fairly certain that
the ash tray is the same type as on the spare tire cover.  Was the base
the same?

yes it takes the same ashtray.   And you know what, I dont know, never un 
covered a seat with an ash tray, and that is a d^mn good question.   Cause 
that means you have a problem making a kombi middle seat into a 
standard/deluxe middle seat.      As it happens I have a middle seat right 
here I will tip it forward and it seems there is a sort of backing under the 
upholstery under the ash trya the idth of the seat. across the 2/3 part, all 
the way down on the far drivers side, and partway down on the side by the 
fold down.  Bet a donut the rivets go through the upholstery into that 
cardboard?  hardboard?  backing, but I am not uncovering this seat to find 
out unless someone wants to trade a 62- on  middle seat for a 61 one, this 
upholstery matches my deluxe, so I would keep it.
