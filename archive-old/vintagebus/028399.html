 There is a pretty nice 21 window with safaris that somoeone
 drives around my town. I'ts parked in the same place everyday.
 Even the rainy ones. I have to laugh when I see those big sheets
 of plastic he has under his safaris on the rainy days. Don't know if 
 they are og or not. I guess it's worth all the trouble but I can't emagine
 why. I never see him driving with them open.

depends on you climate, expect.  I have factory og safaris in my 61.  when it 
got hit and damaged I bought a ratty 65 westy, which also happened to have 
factory OG safaris.   After the first summer I removed them, even the welded 
on mounting plates and all, and offered them for sale, complete unrestored 
set.  Took a fairly long time to sell, for all that people say they are the 
best, folks don't want to bother to restore a set.   I learned they leaked 
with NOS seals.  The climate here means they would suck much more often than 
they would be cool.  If I lived in So Cal or Az, I probably would have kept 
them, as they would be nice much more than they would be annoying.  It just 
doesn't get in the eighties much here in W Wa.  THink both buses had migrated 
north from the L A area in the 70s hippy back to the land movement, and air 
force repostings
