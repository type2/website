about the reduction boxes, do I just remove the axels at the tranny and 
reattach them to the type 1 or type 3 tranny? &gt;&gt;

Hi Byran,
Best to just do things right and either get a rebuilt bus tranny center 
section with a 4.125 or the freeway flier 3.875 R&amp;P.  The type three has a 
bug .82 fourth gear, unlike the higher .82 of bus and KG.  Result will be at 
best a 50 MPH _at_ 3,000 RPM tranny.  Which will cost you more in engine 
longevity and $$$ losses from lower MPG if you plan to do highway speed 
driving.  In other words you would easily lose enough money $1.35 per gallon 
in less than 50,000 miles to properly rebuild the tranny instead.
