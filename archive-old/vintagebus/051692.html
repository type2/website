Subject: RE: [VB] Need for speed - limit

One of the funny things I saw on one of my cross country adventures was a
minimum speed limit (45mph) sign on a freeway!! What happens when our buses
reach a hill. Have to exit?

Y'know, I have a stock bus which I drive at about 58MPH.  I don't feel
terribly unsafe on freeways and I really don't care if some random trucker
gets upset at having to change lanes to pass me.  They need _something_ to
gripe about or they won't have anything with whichto cuss at each other
over the CB.

I prefer the side roads, but I'm not going to stop using the freeways
because I don't run the speed limit.  The speed limit is a maximum, not
the only speed you can run.
