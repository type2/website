Mary Beth and I are still planning on making it, but we may not be able to
leave Houston until around Noon. 
Our usual and typical conflict juggling of event A competing with event B
!

If so, just for the fun of it, I may meet the caravan at the start to say
hello, and join up later.

We drove back from Waco yesterday. Stopped in little town of Calvert to
look at &quot;stuff&quot;
They are having an art festival this Saturday, so it might be a nice place
to stop for a mid-trip break.
I'm sure they would love to see the buses parked on main street, and would
make a big deal out of everyone being there.
