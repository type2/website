Subject: Re: [VB] oil filler neck never tight

&gt; hey kids,
&gt; here's the deal, my oil filler neck never stays put. i
&gt; don't think it was tightened down enough the first
&gt; time it was put on so oil got in and coated the
&gt; threads. now it comes off about every month. i can
&gt; tell every time it comes off because my compression
&gt; goes to sh*t. what would cause this?

No idea.  A loose filler neck (I'm assuming you're referring to the sheet
metal part that the cap fits onto) shouldn't bother compression at all.

&gt; do i have to
&gt; tighten up my generator tie-down to keep the generator
&gt; stand  from jiggling so much?

The tie-down is to secure the generator, not the stand.  the stand should
be secured by the four nuts on the top of the engine.

&gt; or is there a lock
&gt; washer that is supposed to go in there? another issue.

No washer.  I used hylomar on the surfaces to prevent leaks and a touch of
anti-sieze on the threads.

&gt; has anyone found a good tool to tighten down the
&gt; fastener for the oil filler neck? the best thing i've
&gt; found is a 1 1/2&quot; wide paint scraper, but there has to
&gt; be something better than that.

There's your problem!

There are two tools that you can use.  One is a disc with two projections
that engage the slots on the internal gland nut.  You use this with a
standard ratchet and extension.  If you use this make
sure that the slots are clean and square.  Get a new nut if they aren't.
Hold the tool firmly against the gland nut and don't let it shift while
tightening.

The other tool is an internal cam wrench that expands inside the gland
nut.  I have no experience with these in this application.  they work well
for removing short nipples from pipe fittings, but who knows about gland
nuts!
