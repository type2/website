The largest collection of Thing classified ads on the Web (over 200 ads)
is at the Thing Registry, http://www.orcalink_dot_com/~things/.  When you
get there, scroll down and click on page 5.  Ads are grouped by price
range.

My son had the same 'itch' a couple years back, but found that the price
of Things in decent shape had already been jacked up beyond his price
range by the younger crowd with 'phat' stereo installations.  As
elsewhere, less resto work = higher sales price.  So... he settled for a
cherry VW 412 wagon!
