Subject: Re: [VB] Oil pressure gauge readings...

Hi John,
Too high would be 80 lbs. or higher, and too low would be 6 lbs. or lower.  
As for normal range it depends on outside weather temp, driving conditions and 
RPM.  For us we keep it between 50 and 20 lbs..  You high pressure and RPM 
sounds right on to what we get in this weather, but your low pressure at idle 
sounds about 10 lbs low.  Wether it could be from a slightly incorrect reading 
gauge/sender or that your is really low....
