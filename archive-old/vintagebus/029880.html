Thanks to Sean, Scott, and Ted for disabusing me of the idea (T4 assist
blower as main heater blower) on other grounds.  Sounds like an inline
meltable bilge blower under the front floor is a better solution.

I had mixed results with this (bilge) method in a 68 bus several years
ago.  Airflow was dramatically improved, yes, but the air was pretty
tepid vs. stock flow temp -- probably a leaky situation, sucking in cold
air.

This is in a 71 bus with pretty decent heat as it is, so I'm not yet
ready to cut the pipe.  I'm in North Florida (no, WE voted correctly; it
was just them expatriate Yankees downstate) and although the temps were
in the mid 30s this AM, it doesn't get much colder than that.

Anyhoo, thanks for the feedback!

Joe
