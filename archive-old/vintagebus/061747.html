Subject: Re: [VB] Temp Question


With all the talk of oil temps, I got to  thinking what is too high. 
Can someone tell me why it is OK for my water cooled VW VR6 to run 240
all the time.  I've got over 140K on the thing and in the summer with
the air on it hovers right around 240 NEVER any problem with it.  I
change at 3K and I've never had a bit of trouble.

Why is 210 suddenly a disaster point with oil in an ACVW??  What am I
missing, isn't a degree a degree??  Is it the actual structure of an air
cooled motor that can't handle the higher temp?

Steve
