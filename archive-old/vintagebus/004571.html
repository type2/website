I have a freeway flyer in my bus which so far hasn't been driven due to a
lack of engine.  I'm gonna go places with this bus so I elected to give up
town drivability for highway gearing.  I hope this 1776 with 40IDF's will
have the power I need.  Sounds like it will.

Another thing I wanted to mention FWIW - when it comes to mileage on my VWs,
I turn a blind eye because I was so used to dumping 20 to 25 bucks a week
into the old Chevy's I used to drive, anything a dub gives me is better.
I'm sure this may change if I had a big old 2 or 3 liter engine putting out
some power but if that is what it takes to equal the rotten mileage a V8
gives, I'm happy with what I've got.  Don't get me wrong - I'm not trying to
justify myself or cut anyone down - I just thought you'd get a kick out of
hearing my approach on the issue. :-)
