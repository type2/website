Hey everybody, 
since it's Friday, can I just say &quot;what's the deal
with the crow's feet thread?!&quot;

When you put the hubcap on the wheel, does it look any
different from the non-crow's feet rims?

Another question:

When did VW go from the slash end bumpers to the
symetrical (pointed) ends?


My 67 has a symetrical front bumper, and a repro slash
rear. I'd rather have the pointed rear if that's
correct. Is it?

And what's the deal with the splash guards? Is that
stock? When?

And if that weren't enough toask, what about the
rubber guards on the overriders? Stock? aftermarket?
or optional?
