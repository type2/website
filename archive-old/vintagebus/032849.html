&lt;&lt; you start by inserting the choke element so that the hook part grabs the
 choke and turn it counterclockwise till the lines match up and then how much
 further? i think i almost have it figured out and it seems that it would be
 counterclockwise for more choke is that right? &gt;&gt;
Hi JB,
Whoops!  We did get those directions reversed.  Thanks for the correction JB! 
 Yes, the more you turn the choke counter-clocwise the more and long the 
choke stays on.  This should be adjusted for the weather conditions at least 
twice a year if not four or six times for areas the weather changes temp 
and/or humidity more often.   Eric&amp;Barb
Thanks again, Eric&amp;Barb
