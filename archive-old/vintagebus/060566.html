&gt; Hi I'm looking at my 1963 rear brakes 36 mm nuts, they look just like '64
&gt; brakes with the 46 mm nut any other differences I can look for?

Hi Loyd,
If you have complete 1963 only rear brakes and suspension you should have 
brake drums with &quot;D&quot; at the end of the part numbers cast inside the drums.  
Our best advise if you have this 63 one ton suspension is replace it with 
1964-67 suspension if you plan on daily driving it or long trips.  Then give, 
trade, sell the 63 only parts to someone who has a bus with the proper 
Mcodes.  If you decide to just keep the 63 onlpy suspension then you will 
need to get at least enough spare parts to replace one side for roadside 
emergencies.
