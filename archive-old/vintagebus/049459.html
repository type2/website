Subject: Re: [VB] Re: weathering engine block


&gt;  The conclusion is that some decades ago,  some
 engine builders deliberately left their cases
 outside to weather for a while before doing the
final
 machining.

&gt;
To the best of my knowledge, the weathering is done
with cast iron items (still done with the better
quality power tool castings, such as table saws and
jointers) before final machining to let some internal
stresses relieve themselves.  Never heard of it being
done with magnesium, but I haven't heard of lots of
things. &lt;G&gt;

Don't do this.  Magnesium alloy left in the rain will corrode and swell
over time. If you have a case laying around (or have a nearby VW boneyard)
, look at the oil drain area - often this area is rotted, pitted or crumbly
and white. This is due to water, which attacks the magnesium and causes it
to become powdery, ie &quot;rusts.&quot;  It also substantially weakens the metal.
I know folks who have simply rebored the swollen bearing seats to clean
them up to a standard size, but internal oil passages can be significantly
reduced in I.D., and the case subject to odd cracking patterns due to metal
corrosion.

It's best to keep your cases out of the rain.
