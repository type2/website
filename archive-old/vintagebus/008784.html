Subject: Mid-day 67 bus update

I've been working on the bus for about 5 hours straight today.  So far I've
managed to get the tie rod assemblies on.  Both assemblies use loc nuts
instead of the castellated/cotter key setup but 2 of the nuts were missing
out of one package.  I took the drill press, located and drilled the holes,
and put the castellated nuts on.  Whoever decided to use nyloc nuts was a
few bricks short of a full load because the tie rods spin as you try to
tighten the nuts.  I ended up having to cobble up a c-clamp, vise-grip, and
the impact wrench to get the nuts snugged up.  I also drilled the bottoms of
all 6 tie rods, tapped them, and installed zerk fittings so I can keep
things lubed up.  Damn them sealed units anyway - my grandpa hates them and
so do I.

I've got the backing plates on and the wheel cylinders kind of hanging
there.  I just went and bought some front shocks and have stopped here at
home to clean up some parts on the wire wheel.

I've removed the races on the front drums, put in the new, grease the inner
bearings and installed them along with the seals.  I found a couple of large
sockets (1 1/8&quot;) that worked great for removal and installation of the small
outer race.  I took 3 large hammer blows to knock it out and about as many
to install it.  The large race came out with about 5 blows but installation
was slower due to using a punch to have to seat it.  I used a 90 degree bent
ice pick to feel around and make sure that the races and seals were seated
properly.

The last time I posted about a race/bearing process, I got reamed by a bunch
of doomsdayers who said I'd distorted the race and all this other hooplah so
if you wanna holler about my methods, go ahead but don't fill my mail box up
this time.  I'm just relating how I do things and it works great if you know
what you're doing.

More later...
