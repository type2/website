Subject: Re: [VB] Subjective Brake question

I pulled this stunt on a friend of mine when I first put the
new brakes in the 60 DD.  We're ripping down the street, and I said
&quot;Oh, by the way, I put in all new brakes (*SCREECH*)&quot; He few
forward and smacked his head on the window, cracking the OG glass.

&gt; the disc brakes don't need barely any pressure. 
&gt; Yes you will actually have to push down on the brake pedal with drum brakes. 
&gt;  That said, if you actually stand on the pedal, the bus should come to a 
&gt; schreeching halt and things from behind should fly forward, maybe whacking 
&gt; you on the back of your head etc.  
&gt; 
&gt; Warn any passengers first, please.
