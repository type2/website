I recently bought a Hella combination spotlight/mirror to mount on my '63.
It came with a mounting arm used to attach it to a motorcycle.  I am looking
for the correct mounting arm like the one used on VW ambulance models.  Does
anyone have one that they can take dimensions from so I can fabricate it.
Better yet, does anyone have one they are willing to part with?  See the
mirror at:

Thanks in advance for any help.
