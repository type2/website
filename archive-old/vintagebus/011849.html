I would tend to agree w/ Josh.

My westy is quite stock and i don't like hacking it up.

98% of the time the coldbox/icebox does not reside in the bus because

1. it is a major space hog
2. it makes getting in the bus a PITA because it blocks the front door
3. the insulation/weatherseal is so crummy in the bus that the ice melts very quickly

i went and bought an &quot;extreme&quot; coleman cooler that has double thick insulated walls and good weatherstripping snaps tight and keeps ice COLD!

best of all when you get to the campsite you can _easily_ take the coolers out to free up space inside the camper, and as an added benefit you can sit on them..

by contrast the cold box is a brute to get out, conveneiently store etc..
