Subject: PLF has still not delivered nor contacted me, if you see them at 
	OCTO...

PLF still has $700 of my money for Double Cab canvas since August 1999, and
I formally asked for a refund in December (and that request for refund was
acknowledged in person in January).

Since January, I have NOT been provided any product, nor will they even talk
to me.

So, if you see Dawn and Richard... please let me know.  It would be nice if
they would at least contact me regarding when I will get my money back.
