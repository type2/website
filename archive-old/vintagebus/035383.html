Just so Happened i was wire brushing Dave Kilpatrick's 67 21 window this 
afternoon at the beltline, as i'm replacing the complete left side to the 
middle of it any way, the bottom is red and the top is white . as i brushed 
the white off at the beltline ,i ran into red under it , if needed i can send 
pics ,, i have no idea if this is orginal paint or not ,but as faded as it is 
i assume it is ,,later
