Subject: RE: [VB] Tranny Question

  I just had a 3.44 r/p trans built to replace my 3.88 with 77 4th gear. I
cruise at 78 mph at 3800 rpms with the 3.88. The 3.44 r/p trans I had built
uses a 89 4th gear. According to caculations and recommendation by Rancho I
went with a 1.32 3rd and an 89 4th. This should give me a lower percent of
drop between 3rd and 4 th gear and lower my rpm's by 400 at the same speed
in 4th.
  All the specs, rpm's and gear ratio's used should be in the archieves.

ronnie  185X14 tires, 16,000 miles on this trans (there is not a problem
with the old trans, I just like real drive testing on different gear
ratio's)

pps 1800 stroker engine

&gt; I want the lower gears and RGB's for mountain driving here in Ewtah, will

Hi Curt,
If you want to do so high of MPH you will definitely need the 1964-67 brakes

and thusly require the later RGBs (With the bigger better inner lower 
bearings!!) and front beam also with the 20% bigger brakes.  Personally we 
would go with the 3.44 R&amp;P with gears 1st 3.8, 2nd 2.25, 3rd 1.217, and 4th 
.82, especially since you have the 1835cc which is going to have more
cooling 
problems above 3,000 RPM during the summer.  Hopefully your 1835cc size is 
due in part to a stroker crank and SP that will give you more torque which
is 
what you really need for hill climbing.  We would suggest having a super 
strong tranny properly built to take the torque of a type 4 engine.  That
way 
if the 1835cc is not enough of a hill climber for you, then you can convert
a 
type 4 engine to upright and more than likely have all the power you might 
need.
