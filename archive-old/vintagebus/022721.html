If you have any Plastic Molding companys near you I would ask them where
they get their Molds chromed. I just got a couple of molds back from a
local mold plater and it has to be the best chrome job I have ever seen.
i.e. Mirror finish and extremly low ammount of distortion (compared to the
original part).
