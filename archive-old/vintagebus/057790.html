Subject: Re: [VB] Removing oxidation on Pot metal

try NEVR-DULL Magic Wadding Polish.  It is this cotton like material 
with some sort of polishing agent on it.  I used it to clean the 
corrosion of of my aluminum camper windows.  Works very well.

I think you can get it at the hardware store, or do a search on NEVR-DULL

&gt;really do not want to bead blast or sand it off.  Are
&gt;there any chemicals out there that would restore the
