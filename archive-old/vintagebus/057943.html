Subject: Re: Fw: [VB] vacuum dizzy upgrade problems

Problem solved- used a big hammer to 'modify' the clamp such that 
there's no interference.  Then I was able to turn the notch to the 2 
o'clock position as Ronnie informed me- bus is now running.  Thanks 
everyone for all the help!!  someone told me dual vacuum's suck.  guess 
I'll find out soon.

&gt; Chris,
&gt;     There are at least two different types of distributor clamps.  The 
&gt; early ones work with the original vacuum advance units and the later 
&gt; clamps work well with 009 and dual vacuum distributors.  Sounds like 
&gt; you are finding the clamp's bolt getting in the way.
&gt; Try and find the right clamp for your dizzy!   Gary Gibson
