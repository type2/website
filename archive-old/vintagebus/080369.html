I don't blame you, the HVW and VWT have changed over the years. They
were quite different back in the eighties. As far as the ads go, where
else would VW related parts advertise nowadays? Seems that the two mags
have got it all to themselves now, cept maybe the Baja mags.

To be blunt, I believe that Hot VWs is very prescriptive and formulaic.
The buses shown reveal nothing of the wide gammut that exist within the
Type2 scene, and with the exception of one '70 Panel I've seen nothing
pre'68, which is fine if that's all you want but very blinkered
considering the number of Bays out there.
