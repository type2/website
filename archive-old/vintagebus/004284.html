Afternoon list,

Last night pulled the tranny out as the nose cone studs are stripped.  (How
that happened, don't ask me, but actually not the reason for this post...)

The connector from the shift rod to the gear selector lever (hockey stick)
seems to have fused to the &quot;hockey stick&quot;.  After a 1/2 hour of pushing and
banging and twisting and 1/2 a can of WD-40, still no budge.  I had to
unbold the nose cone just to get the tranny, balancing precariously on my
floor jack, free of the engine bay.

The last time the tranny was out was about 8 years ago.  Any thoughts?  Ever
happened to you?
