I am gonna be there...long blonde hair usually in a
pony tail 6'1 ish...driving a pastel green slammed `52
split sunroof bug...first year I have been
bus-less...but man cannot live by bread alone and I
needed a change of pace added to the collection...just
finished the bug like 2 days ago so I GOTTA drive
it....anyways I am still a die hard buser just look
for the lowered green split sunroof...I am sure there
won't be many of those there! ;-) If you see me make
sure you grab me and say hi! 

Check out the Michigan Volkswagen club's web page for
details...There is an impromptu cruise of sorts at the
VWOA headquartere from 3-6 Sat and then a big party
thing at the host hotel 9-???  Lots of cars in the
parking lot ect....
