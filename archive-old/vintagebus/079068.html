Subject: Bus sighting on CNN

I've seen the same story on CNN twice now.  They're doing a piece about high
Gas prices and I assume they're in Calf. ($2.19 for regular).  At the pumps
there's a Red/White Kombi with no rear bumper refueling.  Last night the
camera came in on it and young guy (at least to me) was refueling it.

Should this be a Friday post?
