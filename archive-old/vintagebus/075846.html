Subject: Re: [VB] axle-beam lock-plate problem

[...]

Hi Rocco,

I ran into the same problem when I swapped beams about a year ago.  You get 
three on, and the fourth one is tight.  First of all, the manual is not 
wrong, and yes you do need to get the plates on the way they are diagrammed 
in the manual.  Here is what I did.  First I chased the threads with a tap.  
That makes it ALOT easier.  I got the three other bolts with the plates in 
the correct orientation on tight enough that the bolt heads hold the plates 
in place.  I did not snug the bolts, because you need the beam to have a bit 
of wiggle room when you are getting on the stubborn 4th bolt.  Now for the 
4th.  I put the flat end of the lock plate against the beam where it should 
sit.  The hole for the lock plate doesn't quite line up wih the hole in the 
bus body, right?  If you lift the end of the lock plate opposite the flat 
side up towards you a bit, you can get the bolt to go through the hole in 
the lock plate, and into the hole in the bus frame.  The lock plate is now 
diagonal (looking at it from the bottom) with the flat side on the beam 
where it should be.  Now, tighten the fourth bolt, you might have to hold 
the lock plate in place with a screwdriver to keep it from spinning out.  
Once the head of the bolt comes in contact with the lock plate, one of two 
things will happen.  If you don't hold the lock plate down with a 
screwdriver, the flat edge will &quot;pop&quot; out of place, and you get to curse and 
start all over again.  If you hold it in place, and tighten the bolt 
simultaneously, the bolt head will force the plate into position, and since 
the other three bolts are just a bit loose, the beam will settle into its 
new home.

Hope this is understandable, good luck.  You need to put it back together 
like the manual says.

&gt;Hi folks,
&gt;I'm currently re-installing my axle-beam. According to the VW workshop 
&gt;manual
&gt;the mounting-bolt lock plates must sit in a particular direction (each one 
&gt;is
&gt;different). I'm having trouble with the upper rearward plate. When I place 
&gt;it
&gt;in the specified position (with the flat of the plate pointing rearward 
&gt;along
&gt;the lip of the beam mount as per the manual's diagram) the hole does not 
&gt;align
&gt;with the beam's hole. All eight plates are exactly the same, so I'm not 
&gt;using
&gt;the wrong one.
