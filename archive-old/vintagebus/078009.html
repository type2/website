Subject: Re: [VB] Friday Topic Moving to Hawaii Need Help

&gt; Anybody out there that knows please help. Looking to move to Hawaii this
&gt; summer and do not want to leave behind my kids('66 Splitty, '77 Westy). Does
&gt; anyone know of a freight service that can do this. Anyone have experience
&gt; with this? I might have to leave one behind.

Matson ships cars to Hawaii.  My sister on Maui just shipped her new car she
picked up in Oregon out of Long Beach-they told her it might take 5 weeks,
but it arrived in 10 days!  Take off any parts you don't want to loose tho.

Orrr, you could send them via air freight!  I once shipped by new 71
Superbeetle (I know, I know, but it was my first new car-had a $57/mo. car
payment) home from college for the summer via  Pan Am air freighter!
Of course my Mom worked for Pan Am &amp; it had to go standby.
