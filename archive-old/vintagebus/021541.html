&gt; Great article on replacing 67 and earlier MC's with later dual circuit ones. 
&gt; One question however. I am getting ready to order the suggested 71 and 
&gt; later 
&gt; MC, and I can't figure out which one. I don't see one specific for 71 and 
&gt; later. And teh ones I do see, say with or without servo. Which one should I 
&gt; be looking for. I plan on ordering form busdepot_dot_com if that makes a 
&gt; difference. You did mean 71 or later bus MC right? Thanks again!
&gt; 


Give me a break. It has been a long day! I had my busdepot screen minimized 
while writing that letter, and as soon as I sent it and maximized my busdepot 
screen, it was staring me straight in the face. 71-79 bus master cylinder. 
$29.95   Thanks anyways!
