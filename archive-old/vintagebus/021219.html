Everything's OK.  The FAA rescinded the
lighter-than-air flight restrictions a couple days
ago.  As you might imagine it was front page news
here.

The only news about restrictions concerns the fact
that there is a limit of &quot;only&quot; 750 balloons at the
fiesta this year, and we're going to have fewer
foreign balloons because the shipping charges for
balloons are 
much higher than in years past (like triple!), but
we're definitely a go!

Hope to see all of you there, and don't forget there's
a free lunch for all put on by Foreign Aide at the
show Saturday.
