Subject: Re: [VB] Clear Speedo needles.  What year did that end?

Hey, I think I can actually answer one for a change!

The last three months of the 1960 model year had the
first 80mph speedo.  This switch occurred at the same
time as the switch from the bastard 40 horse to the
regular 40 horse.  (I believe these were clear needle
speedos still.)

1961 saw a new needle color, I believe at the front of
the model year.  Check out the middle issues of 1995
HVW's for the &quot;definative&quot; answer though.  (around
May/June of that year.)  They did a once a month
series on the bus from sometime in '94 through
sometime in '97.

hth, ~j.
