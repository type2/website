Subject: Re: [VB] sun visor

The bracket with the metal rod attached can be removed from the visor by
removing the screw on the visor's body.  You won't find any of the
catalogs selling this piece only, just reproductions of the whole
assembly.  Be careful about buying a repro (for example, the TMI brand)
as they have been known to keep flopping down in your face unlike the
originals.  It might be best to try some JB Weld to hold the old bracket
together until you can find a complete replacement visor at the flea
market in your next available VW show.  They're usually pretty
reasonable in price there.

Just my $0.02 worth...

&gt; Howdy all. The driver's side sun visor on my '62 Crew cab finally gave out on me. The plastic triangular plastic piece that screws to the body broke. I was wondering if I can just replace that bracket, or if I have to replace the whole thing. Also, this is a driver, nothing near a restoration, so if other incorrect years would fit, that would be fine also. I just want to have one for those lovely afternoons riding off into the sunset...
