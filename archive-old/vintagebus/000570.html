Hi NQ,
Actually the part that grounds in the 1958-67 tail lights is a small pointed 
bump on the rear of the bulb holder.  This pokes through a small hole in the 
lense/bulbholder seal, and is expected to prick through the paint, and any 
later corrosion into the metal of the body making the ground.
To increase the effectiveness of the later grounded bulbholders make sure to 
solder the riveted ground tab to the bulbholder to prevent corrosion, or 
looseness of the tab!  This same problem often happens to early coils with 
the riveted on terminals, and the same fix works well there.  
If you have nice early bulbholders you want to use, you can solder a ground 
wire to each directly to the front of the bulbholder.   Eric&amp;Barb
