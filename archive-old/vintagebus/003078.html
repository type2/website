&gt;
&gt;bus buy and sell ethics, ya right, i find that few and far between
probably half and half, the bus butchers, no ethics.  the rest of us work
hard
 on the deals, i myself like to get more people in buses, as does vw howard
and a lot of others in the bus world, but being snaked out of a bus,
have had it happen to me many a times, i always give the
&gt; the first serious buyer a chance, but money talks and bulls_at_#it walks,
&gt; to many times i have held a bus or part on a verbal, YA i want it&lt; with
&gt; no deal ever happening, so now i set a time limit, then it's fair game
 again. vwhoward and i have worked together on many a buses, the deluxe
&gt; i just bought was found by him, he had first choice and passed on it, so
i bought it
&gt; his new 57 double door, he found it, i went to buy it, but called him
first, if you
&gt; want it i won't buy it, and he did!! we also found a single cab, he  wants
it, the owner
&gt; wants to trade with me, i won't do the deal till howard has the chance  to
buy it first!!!
&gt; while he was here yesterday, i got a call on another deluxe for sale,  but
that's my
&gt; deal, and i'm going to buy it (another 66 hardtop deluxe, except
walkthrough)
&gt; i know where the barndoor is howards trying to buy, i wouldn't try to  get
it, it's his
&gt; deal, but i'd help him get it. but thats how the bus world should be,
helping each other
&gt; find and get cool buses, without stepping on toes.

&gt; pomona was strange this round, good deals, i must have missed them all,
except
&gt; the original westy folding ladder i got (but that was offered to me by a
guy just
&gt; walking through, because he saw my 2 racks on my bus) you could have
bought a bus for sale in the f/s area (there were lots of deals ) parted it
out  there, if you
&gt; could get the prices people were asking for parts, made a killing and
bought 2
&gt; more buses with the profit!!!!!!!!!!!!!
&gt;
&gt; but if the deal on my deluxe falls through and the second back-up deal
doesn't work
&gt; i'll take no quarter up on his v8 offer, slam it , stretch it using my
other deluxe, and
&gt; go cruising with my bud, kyle (westfailure) to all the shows, hell kochs
got over
&gt; 40g's for their stretch deluxe, then take the leftover parts and build a
shorty.
