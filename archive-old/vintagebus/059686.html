Subject: Brosol, how bad?

I've been seeing messages fly past from time to time commenting on the quality of the Brosol carbs.

I was going through the 1600DP that came with my '65 DC and lo' and behold, I've got a 34 pict-3
Brosol carb on it. How bad are they? Is it bad enough that I should look into replacing it?
