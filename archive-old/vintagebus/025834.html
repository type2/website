Hey,

While looking over my new to me 67 Westy HT, I noticed something that is
not on my 65.  It seems that the gas tank is a bit bigger.  Along with
this there are two support struts that brace the floor of the tank bay.
They look all original and don't seem to be a bay window tank retrofit.
Did the 67's have bigger gas tanks?

This bus also has a camber compensator.  Was this a VW part?

Steve
