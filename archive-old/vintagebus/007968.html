Subject: CR9710 Steering Box Seal
Date: Sat, 8 Apr 2000 08:11:33 -0500
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

I got the T2 steering box output shaft seal today from the FLAPS.  CR9710 is
the key to remember!  They contacted a bearing and seal company in Lincoln
and since one of the guys that works at Champion Auto happens to live in
Lincoln and commutes down here everyday (80 miles rt) he was able to pick it
up for me.  That was cool.  When I picked up the seal, the guy related some
of the conversation he had with the supply house.  Something along the lines
of, &quot;Wow - that thing is metric through and through - must be some European
part.&quot;  According to the guy at the flaps, it references to a seal used on a
Saab.  Good ol' Saab. :-)

I'll be installing the seal tonight.  Oh and BTW - the box is labeled
Chicago Rawhide 9710 CR 25x36x7 CRW1 R
It is made in USA, it's labeled CR9710 and is green on the outside with
black rubber inside.  The UPC code is 85311  00766
and it cost me a little over 7 bucks - actually 6.99 plug 6.5% sales tax.
Hope this helps all of you trying to find the part.
