Steve (show up late as heck) Harris biffed the
introduction at the OCTO... and tried to pass it off
as being too early... 

EARLY!? What are you talking about? The sun was
already up, the outhouses and Kyle T were already half
full! I just figured that you had just come in from
early (church) service extended Bible study and a long
breakfast with the family. ;-) Kidding...
I was told that the tent was $500.00. It was literally
right out of the box when I saw it. All that I need is
another tent. EddieVH?, Robert Davis or stretching it
a bit maybe even Greg Noble- I support almost anyone
driving a bus. Exception given to my man Rubber
Johnny. &lt;insider Jerome joke that was no laughing
matter at the time&gt;.

I had a great time at Dusty's pre-OCTO get together.
Slept in my bus which was teaming with newly acquired
interior parts. Barely had a place to laydown.
Ironically, I actually had the best nights sleep in
months away from the Black  Ops helicopter flight
path, emergency vehicle traffic, restless sleeper wife
and baby. Placed a few Zbed parts on the 3/4 rack over
night and launched them on the way to the OCTO. Had to
flip a b*tch and retrieve them. hahahah! Mondo head
winds in both diections to/from California. Whats up
with THAT?
Stopped way out in the middle of no where to check for
what I thought was a front whl bearing noise. All was
cool but the bus wouldnt start again! California call
box after no success in jumping the starter with a
screwdriver. No way I could have pushed the bus fast
enough to get it going. Used the Calif emergency call
box and the CHP was there in like 90 seconds. Cop
wanted to push me up to 20-30 mph and then back off! I
told him that 5-7mph would be plenty.  Pfft!
15amp fuse in the hardstart relay replaced Monday AM
was the fix. Forget the shows, Eddie, the chickenwire
posers, politics, *those guys* ;-) who sell buses to
the Japanese gentlemen, and all that. I love just
hittin the road. =)
