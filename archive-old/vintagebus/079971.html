Subject: re: classic insurance

The listees are correct in that GEICO will write policies for our older
VWs, but just liability, not collision or comprehensive. Comp insurance
is written by a subsidiary of GEICO, American Collectors, but I didn't
check with them to get a quote, but I will before I renew my Hagerty
policy next year. I can't go with just liability--after thirty years
out of a bus, I don't want an accident to keep me out of one while I
save up for repairs. I am sorry about the misinformation.
