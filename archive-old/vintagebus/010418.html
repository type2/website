I'd try a Dremel tool and some heavy-duty cutting disks.  That's what I use
to cut 1/2&quot; steel re-bar, among other things.

Pay close attention to where the stream of sparks goes, and don't forget a
good pair of goggles.

&gt;&gt;  Need to ask the list: How do I get this old bushing off.  The rubber is
long
rotted off but that steel bushing is stuborn as hell to get off of there.
