&gt; i tried to order a cover for my '67 bus from vw california imports but they

Okay, try this:

Goto:

http://www.jcwhitney_dot_com/catsubpic.jhtml?CATID=3004

which is their car cover page. If the above link doesn't work, goto their
homepage, and SEARCH for car cover, which takes you to above.

Then, goto the bottom of the page, to the WOLF CAR COVERS 
link, and click on:

CLICK HERE FOR PRODUCT AND PRICING DETAILS

Select the year and make (VOLKSWAGEN), then hit NEXT,

Then select the model (MICROBUS)

Then select the fabric type. If you're serious about your cover, select
one of the top two covers.

Check your order, then hit BUY, and you're on yer way!
