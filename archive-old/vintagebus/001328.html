Well the only thing besides money keeping me from working on my bus engine
are the main bearings.  Since I have a case that has been 60/80'd (align
bore/thrust) and a crank that is a 10/10 regrind, I guess I need a set of 70
over main bearings and an 80 over thrust if that makes any sense.  If anyone
has a new set they'd like to sell me, I'd like to buy them.  Otherwise, I'd
settle for some good advice on where I can get a set with no hassles and
cheap. (of course.)

No parts have showed up yet from Barrett but I'll keep you all posted on
that fiasco as it develops.

I want to thank all of you who sent me encouraging notes to stick with the
project.  As long as I can maintain a rigorous schedule where I'm making
forward progress, I do okay.  It's these long delays where I blow loads of
money and can't afford to do anything more that get me down.  It really
blows sometimes.

Later!
