Subject: Will trade soul for good motor.

The topic says it all.  I'll write you up a receipt even.  Or if you
need...just take a kidney or a lung or something...

Why is it I always get buses with motors at the end of their life?
Stella made it 13,000 miles...and has a little knock now...but I can
still drive her (she made it to Detroit and back like that) but the 62
here... 6,000 miles?  Theres only 50,000 miles on that motor....but I
guess thats pretty good considering that the motor was starved for oil
for a good 20-30,000 miles with that additional oil cooler on that....
nothing against additional oil coolers...but at least use seals and not
silicone!!  The schmuck who got paid to install that cheaped out and
plugged the inlet and outlet passages on the oil cooler inlet/outlet
with silicone!  oh well....

I'm off to grill up some chicken.  Then maybe borrow my friend Billy's
bike, hook up a little trailer to it...and put the motor on the
trailer.  High Cliff state park isn't far from here...  I wonder what a
VW motor would look like after being thrown off of a cliff.....hmmmmm
