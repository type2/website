First take some pictures and get them in electronic format (like JPEGs),
because you're going to want to be able to post them on the Internet or
e-mail them to interested buyers.  Selling on the Internet is going to
get you far more serious inquiries than simply posting in the paper or
other printed media.  I have the Internet to thank for the '67 Doublecab
I got from the other side of the USA.

Suggest you place classified ads at some of the larger VW fan-addict
websites that specialize in Type 2s, like www.dropgates_dot_com, VW Planet,
Type2_dot_com, and so on.  Commercial classified ad websites like Hemmings,
AutoTrader, and EPage are also good--you can usually post for free with
a slight charge to include some of your electronic photos.

From the &quot;Old Cars Price Guide&quot;, here are 'ballpark' values for a '67
Type 2 DC:

1--trailer queen, never driven:  $11600
2--excellent original or superior resto:  $8100
3--good amateur resto, presentable &amp; serviceable:  $4600
4--deteriorated resto, but driveable:  $2300
5--needs complete resto, but not wrecked:  $1400
6--parts car:  $450

The accuracy of these values is subject to discussion, of course...
