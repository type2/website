Subject: FS: '65 Nose, bumpers
Mime-Version: 1.0

I've got the nose off a '65 and the bumpers (blades only--front's not
great, but rear is pretty decent) available to some needy party. I just
moved into a new house and I took these with me only to keep them from
getting scrapped. The nose is actually the entire front of the bus,
including the dash and part of the window frames. I don't believe there are
any extra holes in the dash, but there might be one. I'll check if it's
important. You'll have to cut the nose to suit your needs; the window lips
are pretty much trash, but the nose itself it straight and I'm confident
there's no bondo.

I'm in Memphis, TN. I'll ship if I can (though the nose has some sharp
edges that might require creative packing...and the thing weighs 100 lbs or
more). I'll give preference to someone who can pick up the parts or meet me
somewhere. I'm thinking seriously of going to Everybus, so I could
*probably* deliver the nose or bumpers there...and that would give me a
better excuse to go (keep in mind that my plans aren't firm yet). The nose
will barely fit in a Westy-sized cargo bay with seats and fridge in place.
The sharp edges will tear your linoleum--don't ask me how I know.

I didn't list a price because I'm pretty flexible...as in if you're broke
and need it and can meet me somewhere, I'll probably just give it to
you...or if you got some parts to trade (I'm in a '72 Riviera now), that's
cool too. I saved the parts to help a split; that's my goal.

Thanks! Joe
