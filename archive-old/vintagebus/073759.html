Subject: Re: [VB] seat stand mats

I didn't use any adhesive on mine, they just lay in place. The outer
edge of the mat (about a 1/4&quot; wide) folds over the edge of the stand and
tucks in right between the stand and door gasket. No metal strip 
required. If you don't have a good door gasket this won't work.

&gt; by 10 screws with washers (which I know wasn't correct). I'd appreciate 
&gt; any advice you might have.
