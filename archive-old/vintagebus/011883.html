&gt; that it would make much difference, shoddy parts such as this will
&gt; continue to be made.  I suppose the only way to combat this problem
&gt; is through education, if all the VW owners learn to tell a good part
&gt; from a bad part, nobody will buy the bad parts and they will stop
&gt; being manufactured.  This posting is my small effort in this direction.

I have ranted on this several times.  As long as there is a quick buck
to be made, there will be crappy parts out there.  Others will say &quot;let
the market decide,&quot; but the problem is a lot of this stuff is sold
mail order, so once you have a crappy part, it's too late.  The problem
is getting even worse, as more stuff is made in Taiwan and India.
Used to be you had a choice of German or Brazilian, and the smart money
said &quot;German.&quot;  Now it's &quot;Taiwanese&quot; or &quot;Indian&quot; and smart money sez
&quot;Pick-n-Pull&quot;

He's right - education is the only way we can help anyone.  If everyone
leans that these places are just selling crap, then people will hopefully
stop buying from them.  It is a herculean task though; only a small
fraction of the VW aftermarket customers are on the net, and the VWT&amp;A\
rags are chock full of ads peddling this crap.

Even the quality of the US-reproduced stuff is going down, as they 
pursue a fatter margin.  Witness the difference in the quality of the
little door bumpers for split-window buses that west coast metric sells.
They used to be like the originals - a bolt with a rubber thing molded
over it.  Now it's just a piece of plastic with threads stamped on it.
The price now is higher than it was 3 years ago when I bought the good ones.
The cost to produce it has to only be a fraction of that.

Don't be afraid to send parts back to hand them back to the guy at the
parts counter if they are not up the snuff.  I went ot buy some motor
mounts a while back.  THe threads had little protector caps on them.
While I was waiting for him to ring it up, I pulled the caps off.  Sure
enough, the threads look like they's been cut by a rabid rottweiler.
I handed them back.  We tried looking at a few more sets, and they were 
all the same.  I went elsewhere.  Those were made in India.
