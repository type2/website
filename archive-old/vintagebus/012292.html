To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

it is a sad when something like this happen to
such a good person, never met JOSH in person, but a couple of years of e-mails i felt i had met him in person, we were all looking forward to his 
coming to BBB III having just gotten recent e-mail
on his trip plans, i will try to set a spot for a small memorial at BBB III for him where people
can leave a little something for his family,
i'm sure that whatever is gathered for him at BBB III can be sent to ken hooper to forward to his
family, its a sad sad thing when something like this happens and my heart goes out to all concerned, ronnie
