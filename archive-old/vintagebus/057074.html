Subject: 63' Westy question

The 63' Westy I just bought has (4) sets of holes
spread along  the passenger side of the roof from
front to back.  Each set consists of (4) 1/4&quot; holes.
They were plugged with silicone, but I cleaned all
that out.  What are these holes for?  I've seen photos
that show a bracket of some type, but I don't know
what it's used for.  Anyone have these brackets for
sale?
I 'm also looking for the table for this van, good
luck right?


Thanks in advance.
Matt
