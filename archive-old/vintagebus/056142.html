Subject: Re: [VB] Grrr,  Westfakia!

I think the only way to settle this question is to see the M-code plate.
It's possible that the bus is a legitimate westy that has had some
replacement or modification done somewhere along the line.
From the looks of the sub hatch, I'd be inclined to belive it's legit.

&gt; I would say that the existing Phosfur (sp?) interior that is present, is a
&gt; giveaway that it is not an original westy.
&gt; The crank out windows were an additional cost over the popouts.
