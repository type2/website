Speaking of high prices (oh no, another ebay slam) there has been two
'Souping the Volkswagen' books by Dick Morgan (covering okrasa, judson, etc)
on recently that went for ~$105 and ~$75!!!  I searched around a bit and
found one for $20.... originally it sold for $3.

Patience is the key but if there is none, buy high and forgitaboutit.

This is a neat book, I have it.  $50 is already too much, however.  It can
be found with some searching and a few months of patience.  I think Jack
Maynard asked me to find him one?  His web address
 http://ucs.orst_dot_edu/~maynardj )is dead so contact me, I have it around here
somewhere...

I'd be interested to know of any other books detailing Bus travels.  Please
let me know the author(s) and title(s), I have book world connections.  This
is for my private collection, not for profit.
