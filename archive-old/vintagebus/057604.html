Subject: leaks no mo!!

Hi List,
Just wanted to say thanks to all who responded about
my leaking crew cab. It seems that the major problem
for the water in the rear seat area was the holes in
the forward portion of the bed, the ones for the bows.
I determined what size bolt I needed, went to the
local hardware store and bought 6 bolts(for the front
and rear), installed, and after it rained all night I
went out this morning to check and sure enough, it was
powder dry back there!
I know I still have to problem to face with the parcel
tray getting water in it, but I've ordered new
grommets for the wiper shafts, which I believe will
fix that problem. After that, a new seal for the
overhead fresh air vent and it should be dry as
Aridzona!! Thanks everybody!!

See ya,
3DPete
