Howdy all,
I have only driven 2 split window buses ever, My current 66 and a 67 I was going to buy. Question: Do all vintage buses steer FUNKY? Both of these did\do.  There is a quite a large &quot;dead zone&quot; for lack of a better description between turning from one side to the other.  You start to drift left, steer right to compensate and at first the steering is a little hard and then all of a sudden it turns quick, usually too much, resulting in over-compensation.  Also, the steering is pretty &quot;hard&quot; once you pass this dead zone. Sometimes after a long drive, my arms are actually physically tired from steering the bus. So, is this common and what can I do to correct it??  I'd wave goodbye to you all now, but my arms are a little rubbery from the drive in this morning...



Peace, John Baker
