&gt; Im trying to get the housing and the generator back together (so its more
&gt; generator related; sorry).  Im looking at the generator, the cover plates,
&gt; the infamous woodruf key, and the squirrel cage.  Im looking exploded
&gt; pictures in catalogs as well (the $%#^ documentation Ive got in these books
&gt; are vague at best)

sorry i'm so late to jump on this thread

did you try the idiot book? not because it gives you a direct answer but
because John's writing is kind of therapy and it brings human qualities to a
bus

for those unemployed goof-offs out there (like me) Read how to use this book
Procedure on how to run procedures,  step seven LOVE. Also, for all the time
management drop outs, go to the introduction and read the last paragraph of the
introduction about logic level and life.

and now back to my own hack &quot;be the Bus... Zen it out&quot;

how obtuse can you be? i remember tellen one of my local buddies how would you
go together if you were one alternator?
the thing is... look at the part. how many ways has it got to go together? what
can the part tell you? Where are the wear markings; where did it rub off the
paint? were did the engine oil deposit on it? what was hidden from the spray?
nice and clean or dirty and worn? were did the PO rattle can spray paint it and
do a lousy mask job? what holes are ovaled and why? Why is a washer cupped a
certain way? think air flow, torque or gravity effects... do you load the dish
washer cups up or cups down? how did Fauns the junior engineer who designed
your parts at volkswagen load his dishwasher? why are there holes/openings
where there are? Do you get my drift?
so you powder coated and chrome plated every thing... look at another part on
the engine or around your current digs.
then read the idiot book again not for the details but as a memory aid.

aloha
