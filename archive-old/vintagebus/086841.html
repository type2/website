Subject: RE: [VB] parts suppliers in Mountain View, CA

Thanks for the tip on Bugformance. I stopped by there on Wednesday night
last week. I drove by it a couple times before I saw it. I'm still getting
used to the endless strip malls here.

I pulled up at 6pm. Just when they were closing, but the guy there let me
in. He was really nice. I picked up a couple things, with the intent of
going back when I have time to look around. I guess they are a full service
place, so I may have them do some work on my truck, until I can figure out
how to work on it myself. As I don't have a driveway or tools yet...

-Kevin

Kevin,

Try BugFormance in Sunnyvale. They are on El Camino Real. Just South of Mt. 
View.
