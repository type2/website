Subject: voltage drops???
Message-ID: &lt;Pine.GSO.4.10.10001241147220.18361-100000_at_cks.ssd.k12.wa_dot_us&gt;

Converted the '66 Westy to 12V...everything is done (almost..) and working
well but I have yet to connect up the windshield wiper motor.  
I tried to use a Bug Pack voltage drop and it doesn't allow enough powere
thru to run them.  Gave a shot at letting 12V thru to the motor and they
run waaaaay to fast.  Beside the point that it is 6V not 12.
I have called around trying to locate a supplier of GOOD volt drop devices
with no luck.  A large ceramic type that uses variable resistance would be
best....but I wonder if anyone makes these beasts anymore???????
I'd appreciate some feedback from those who have a good device working for
them and who can supply a lead for purchasing one.
Thanks
later
