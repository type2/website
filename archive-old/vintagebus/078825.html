Subject: Upcoming Trip

Hello All,

Deep in the throes of preparing the revived '66 Westy for a trip, I need a
break.  But not a long one.  I have been doing things like installing a
reverse light and switch, new door and kick panels, suspension stuff, brake
stuff, oil change, tranny goo check, general lube, fixing funky
tailight/signals, installing the side Westy lightshades, blah blah blah...

A question for any Oregonians:  We are hopefully going to be camping near
Crater and/or Diamond Lakes.  We strongly prefer rustic/rough style camping
to being in a resort or official campground.  Are there any cool sites to
look for in that area?  Water with fish nearby preferred, of course!

Here's our itinerary so far....if anyone happens to be on the route or in
the area travelling around, it would be cool to see you!

*Leave either Thursday night, or VERY early Friday morning (like between
2:00 and 4:00)

*Arrive Smith River, Patrick Creek, search for morels

*Depart Friday midday from Patrick Creek to Gold Beach,  possibly camp along
route to Grant's Pass at nightfall.

*Saturday morning, finish road to Merlin/Grant's Pass, then take I5 south to
Hwy234, then north on Hwy62 to Crater Lake, pass Crater Lake north to
Diamond Lake.  Fish, camp.

*Sunday morning, take alt. road around Crater Lake, then south on Hwy62 to
Klamath Falls.  Take Hwy97 south to Weed, then I5 to Mt. Shasta.  Camp at
Castle Lake.

*Monday morning, I5 to some long dirt road just north of Castella, long dirt
road west to Hwy3-through Hayfork, say hi to
Bro, et al?  Hwy3 to Hwy36, then to Ruth Lake.  Camp/fish.

*Tuesday morning, Alderpoint Road to Home.
