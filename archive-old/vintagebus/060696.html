Subject: Re: [VB] Advice needed-Deck Height. Short block

Hi Al,
Just take it apart and start from scratch!  Balance the rods and pistons if 
good and get a CW crank in there.  Then check deck hieght and the head 
chambers for cc to check for even CR of 7.1:1 or less.  
  Eric's dad many decades ago had a shop build up an engine, he supplied a 
newly reground crank, new sized bearings and all the other good used engine 
parts.  Had no time to do it himself before trip from Washington state to 
Texas and back trip.  Result was an engine that never held proper oil 
pressure and idiot light stayed on at RPMs anywhere near idle.  Took it apart 
when we got back only to find a differant sized well used crank installed in 
the engine!  when confronted with this the shop refused to do anything about 
it due to it having been taken apart by the VW owner and not the shop.
  On a later, same trip, brakes were done by a big repair shop chain in Texas 
with an aligator with cowboy hat on for thier logo.  Things came apart in 
Utah and ripped the right rear axle seal open draining all tranny and RGB 
gear oil on that side of the bus and road.  Turned out they had installed 
Toyota truck parts in the 1957 non-sunroof delux bus!  We had to take two 
days to fix that in a small town and were taken underwing by a black gas 
station owner and his son.  They let us use one of thier repair bays and 
tools!  Without that help at that time we would have been SOL.
