I tried the powdercoating that was used on snowmobile exhaust up here on my
Westfalia. Looked great for two years and then rust showed up. Did the
aluminizing on my Vanagon exhaust and that did not last one year. Ceramic
coating is supposedly good for 3 years (1 year on used exhaust) ... so I'm
told.

So, I'm going to sandblast the Westfalia exhaust again and try high temp
flat black wood stove paint (better than barbeque paint ). Apparently heat
curing the new paint on the &quot;barby&quot; before installation is a hot tip!
