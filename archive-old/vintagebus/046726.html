Subject: Re: [VB] testing a 6V clock
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

&lt;&lt; You know, I've been running the 6V clock in my Karmann Ghia on 12 Volt
 &gt;for 2.5 years now and it works perfectly and keeps good time, too.  &gt;&gt;

All the coil does in an old clock is wind the spring, in my experience, so 
what does it care the voltage, as long as it's enough to pull the mechanism 
and pull the winder sufficiently.  It just works for an instant each time.
