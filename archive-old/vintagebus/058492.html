Subject: RE: [VB] Turn signal switch 6/8 wire

How do you keep from having the ugly mess of connectors between the turn
signal switch and the column?

&gt; What's the difference between the 6 wire and 8 wire turn signal switch?
My 
&gt; 63 schematic shows a 6 wire setup, but the PO replaced it with an 8 wire 
&gt; with two of the wires cut and not connected to anything.  Does this work? 

Hi cahulme, 
It should work, if we remember correctly the other two wires are for 
headlight dimmer switch. 

&gt; Also its in pretty bad shape, is it conceivable to take it apart and 
&gt; re-solder(sp) disconnected wires inside the switch? 

We have actually done this several times when replacing a worn out pre-1964 
turn signal switch with a nice tight used one we have gotten from the swap 
meets.  Often the wiring to the new used switch is just cut off by the 
dissassembler instead of taking the time to disconnect each wire at the 
connections and work the harness of them out.
