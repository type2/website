Kind of fun to watch all the excitement! VW obviously thought they were and
improvement, and they do work well on our '77 Westy. Stick your hand
outside the window at 50mph some day and direct the air into your face.

The funny thing is the response it brings. It seems ok to change the
engine, the trasaxel, the wiring, the gearing, the suspension, maybe the
complete interior and paint, add accessories, but heaven forbid one adds
side scoops!

Just kind of interesting......
