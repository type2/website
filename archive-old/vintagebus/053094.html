Subject: Re: [VB] Oil light flickers on new rebuild.


&gt;I really wish people would take a good HARD look at tests, and when they
&gt;were done, when repeating that &quot;information&quot; to everyone within earshot.
&gt;Otherwise we'll all be driving with Bias Ply tires, straight weight oil,
and
&gt;AM radios. Time marches on (and so does technology), don't get stuck in a
&gt;rut!

... I dont get it. Whats wrong with Bias plys, castrol 30, and a nice AM
radio?
