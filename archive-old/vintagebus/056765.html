&gt; OK, so I have the new seat covers and horsehair pads to redo the front 
&gt; 1/3-2/3 seat of my bus. 

Hi Dewayne,
Hopefully you mean you have new upholstery for your bus!  Seat covers are 
those things used to cover upholstery to protect it.  Worked well for Barb's 
Grandmother's 1950 Chevy.  In 1995 when the car was sold the clear vinyl seat 
covers were removed for the first time.  The fourty five year old OG hering 
bone material was still in mint condition!
