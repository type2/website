 Would an early Bay have the same rear bumper as my 63? When I was looking at 
 it, it seemed to be the same but the two are 50miles away so I couldn't do a 
 side by side comparo. Also would the shifter from the 69 work in the 63? 
This 
 guy is parting out a very clean 69 (hit hard in front) and I'm trying to 
pick 
 off as much as I can use.

the 69 bumper is not the same as a 63 bumper, but it will fit if you use the 
69's bumper brackets.

which part do you mean as the shifter?
