Yet another one: don't let people play in and on of the bus if you're
under it, even if all four wheels are on the ground.  While working
on Steve G's camper, I was an inch away from getting my head 
crunched by the steering box when someone *jumped* into the cab!
The suspension bounced about 4&quot;, which would have felt *really* good
if I'd had by head under the box.  As it was, the pitman arm barely
grazed my hair.
