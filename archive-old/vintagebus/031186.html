Thanks Fred, this is very interesting to me in particular because Barbara, 
myself and our dog Chance are planning to do Eugene-Buenos Aires departing in 
March/April 2002, and I am currently deciding which will be the best Westfalia 
to take along. By the way, Maupin might very well be Fafner's last trip with 
me, as I am considering selling it to someone at work that REALLY wants him. 
We are planning to be travelling for a year or more, so there is no sense of 
keeping Fafner gathering dust and loosing value in a garage...
I have been subscribed to the Los Ligato list for some time now, and find 
their reports very useful and interesting. Their photos are inspiring!
At this point, the three vehicle options I have are:
1-'71 Westfalia (1600 single port upright engine and disc brakes)Simple and 
efficient.
2-'76-79 Westfalia a la Ligato (1600 upright engine conversion)This has the 
advantage of a better designed and more complete interior. (No blind spot 
cabinet, propane stove, 12v fridge, etc.)
3-Go crazy and take my split window Westie. Compatible front end with the 
Latin American buses (no ball joints), great torque for those steep hills and 
amazing in mud/snow. You now the bad sides: not as comfortable of a ride, 
limited front view, drum brakes, reduction boxes. But perhaps the biggest 
problem of a splittie is that it has a one circuit brake system (pre-67), 
which means if you loose your pressure anywhere in the system that is it, no 
brakes.
Allow me to answer a couple of things from Rich's e-mail:

&gt; BUT we do not have enough power to make it about 4500
&gt;meters.

If they are going to Bolivia through Arequipa in southern Peru-a very common 
route-they are going to need to drive areas close to 5,000 meters above sea 
level (about 15,000 feet). This is where we our alternator died when I did the 
journey in '92. Nobody in miles, only big trucks working at nearby mines that 
were 24v systems, so couldn't give us a jump. Got a ride in the back of one of 
these and after 8 hours made it to Arequipa. Came back with a mechanic the 
next day and thank god he was able to fix it after working for hours in the 
dark and with one of the coldest nights I've ever experienced. But that is 
another story...
&gt;
&gt;Some friends have told us about a German mechanic in La Paz, Bolivia (which
&gt;is at 6800 meters)

La Paz is at 4,000 meters above sea level.

&gt;  I decided that this was
&gt;not the best idea after passing through a few borders so I removed it and
&gt;put the stuff inside.

Not only to prevent questions, but in some Central American borders you are 
forced to drive your vehicle through a 18&quot; or so deep pool of DDT, to prevent 
spreading diseases accross borders...Not only this, but they also spary the 
interior of your vehicle (at least back in '92). We opposed to the latter, 
having to bribe to be able to prevent it. Sorry, I got off track again...

Anyway, thanks Fred and Los Ligato for all this information.
See you at Maupin, hopefully.
