Santa (my brother) brought me a cool metal and plastic splittie that looks
almost exactly like my real '65 camper.  Same color too, Red and white.  It
looks like a pre turn signal bus but it has a sliding side door, hmmm.  It
is about 5&quot; long and on the bottom it says &quot;manufactured with permission of
Volkswagen AG&quot; .  It and my Franklin Mint '67 Beetle from Mom are my
favorite gifts.
Merry Christmas everybody!

JJ  '65 camper
     '86 Scirocco 2.0 16v           I wish I could use the tranny from the
toy bus!
