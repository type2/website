You don't want to be at idle for break-in. At idle your cam lobes get no
oil. Get the revs up right away. Not screaming, but spinning pretty good.
Seems like you would want to idle a brand new motor, but you don't. I like
to pack the oil pump with vaseline so it primes quicker, too. If you have a
slightly loose fitting pickup tube or a non-perfect oil pump it can take
forever to start pumping oil otherwise. Scary. All this is irrelevant to
having the wrong style of pump in the first place, but I just kinda felt
like butting in and giving my unsolicited opinion about a subject that
wasn't being discussed.
