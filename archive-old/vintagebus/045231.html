That bus is NO worse than the RHD barndoor deluxe down here in L.A.
The owner, quoted saying he would have it finished for the classic this year.

&lt;&lt;I dunno, Thom...maybe you should go for it!!  The seller says it's got
those cool and rare (snicker) side barndoors...even tho they're a little
rough.  &lt;smirk&gt;  As an english major, I think rough's just a little bit of
an understatement.  ;)

On the plus side, the tail lights look in really clean shape.
