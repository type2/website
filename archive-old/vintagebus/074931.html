Subject: RE: [VB] Arizona Transaxle Exchange involved-2alarm Fire!

  I saw a clip on the nerws last night of the fire and they said it was put
out before it got into A T E. I know how bad a fire can be, when my shop
caught on fire a few years back I lost 10's of 1000's dollars worth of parts
and inventory, not counting the 6 months it took to get the shop back in
order. 
  I have to thank my loyal customers and 1 friend (yes I have 1 friend) for
helping me get through that crisis

If one fire house can douse the flames then it's a &quot;one alarm&quot; fire. If it
is
so out of control that an additional firehouse EQ and personnel are required
then the dispatch signals an another firehouse(s) and becomes an
incrementally
larger &quot;X&quot; alarm fire.

I am checking this AM to see if all are OK. I am sure that the people are
safe
but the intrinsic loss of the huge stock pile of tranny cores and parts will
be
an additional death nail in the coffin of the VW aircooleds.
