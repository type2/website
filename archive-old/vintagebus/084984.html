Hi Seth,
For proper colored wire to replace DPO rat nest or old brittle engine  
wiring, try your local wrecking yard.  Up into as late as the 1980's  VW used much 
the same wire color coding.  If you can not find VWs try any  other Euro 
manufactured auto.
  Best to repair with either solder and heat shrink, or factory type  brass 
terminals that are super tight swedged with proper tool.  All other  cheapy 
crimp terminals are just trouble later on.
