I have a 65 deluxe 13 window that I would like to have
painted back to its original colors.  My question is:
What would be a reasonable &quot;ball park&quot; price for a
paint job?  I plan to have it bead blasted first and
from the archives it lks like a $1000-$1200 job.  I am
not sure how much to budget for the painting.  It may
help to know I use by bus as a daily driver and am
looking for a good quality job, not a &quot;cheap&quot; job nor
a &quot;show winner&quot; job.

Your help is always appreciated!

Tom
