Heck No, VW Howard bought a camper a couple years back and drove it to
Washington on an unknown engine, I don't even think he tuned it up or
changed the plugs, just the oil and he made it all the way there and back
and continued to drive the bus till he sold it, when it then got totaled
Christmas eve by a drunk driver while parked it the street. If it runs and
rives, doesn't leak to much oil and sounds good drive it. There are buses at
the shows with unknowns in them that have driven 1000's of miles with out
problems. Anyway don't worry, you guys have enough friends along your route
that if you blew an engine you would have a replacement in a day or so. 

Ronnie  available for bus rescues with in 150 miles of Havasu, have diesel
can travel.

    Does every one who goes anywhere have a new engine.  I noticed that
Ronnie in Prescott had a new engine in the wife's car.  JP in Co has one in
his Westy (where did your Havasu trannie go?)  Hell I am getting ready to
drive 1800 miles in the engine that came with the truck that I bought last
Fall.  Am I supposed to be worried or something?  You guys that stay home
need not reply.  Thanks

    &quot;There is nothing in the world as profound as when a tiny group of
people with warm hearts and generous minds get together and bow down to the
gods of unity and humanity.  Ambition is not what we want.  We are happy
with the sharing of our  joy and wonder of life for just a little while
until we go back again and serve humanity to gain our sustenance.  When we
get together and camp, we are family and we find a space for everyone at our
sides.  This is the place where we can lower our shields and be gentle and
kind.  Enjoying ever scar and every eagle's feather that we have earned and
sharing our joi de vivre. &quot; [Kevin Sullivan}
