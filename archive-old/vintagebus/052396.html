Subject: Re: [VB] Just how fast does your bus go??

I don't have reduction boxes anymore and I have a highway built transmission
and a 1907 engine. I can easily peg my speedometer...

But why would I?

I had this stuff built so I could use my bus as a shop truck on the Dallas
freeways. None of my specs were to be a hot rod, but to be a vehicle that
could hold it's own in this nut-house traffic, and I have been incredibly
satisfied. The best aspect is the onramp and merging speeds.

But I would have to be insane to drive a VW bus at 70+ MPH consistantly. It
is not aerodynamic, it has no safety margin and it is not designed for quick
defensive driving moves. It's hard work to control a bus going too fast and
braking hard is no fun. I have no death wish.

On the freeway I do around 65 and keep aloy of distance between me and the
car ahead of me..
