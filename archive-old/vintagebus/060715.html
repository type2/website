Hi Volks,
Good recommendations!  Make sure to your fire extingusher is not a cute 
little one, but at least a 5 Lbs. one.  Where the metal fuel line passes 
through the forward engine tin make sure the grommet around the line is there 
and intact.  If not, you can install a section of flexable fuel line slit 
down the side and hose clamped in place.  Make sure to center punch several 
times around each inlet tube on the carb and fuel pump and the outlet tube on 
the fuel pump to keep them swedged in place.
