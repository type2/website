I don't think so.  bearings are seldom made with sliding surfaces made of
the same materials such as the shims are.  All the sliding probably occurs
between the shims and the thrust bearing, where there are grooves to
introduce oil for hydrodynamic lubrication.  The oil gets squeezed out
from between the shims.  Remember that there is only .006 play, so there
would only be .0015 clearance between shims if the shims were spaced
equally, which doesn't make for much of an oil film.

Porsche uses a single shim in the same application.  They have to stock a
lot more shim thicknesses to set a given end play than you do with a
3-shim stack.
