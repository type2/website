Subject: new shocks on 53  :)
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

Something I didn't post when the list was down post earthquake:

hey I finally got both new front shocks on the 53, and it drives so soo soo 
much nicer.  Many thanks to Everett for giving me the Monroe number for 
barndoor suitable shocks.  Think it is LE10002.  The horrible bumps are gone, 
and the rattle level decreased in a big way.

The upper bolts were the hard ones to undo.  The right one broke, even after 
tapping  and penetrating oil for a week, and I had to spend hours carefully 
drilling the hole out and trying not to mess up the threads.  The old shock 
was probably not original, as it had the later 9 digit part number (Sachs) 
but must have been installed before 66, as that was what the tags said when I 
got the bus.  ???   All the other stuff on this bus seems to have the early 
style part numbers.

During the left side I was introduced to a different part of the art of 
tapping,   using the 17mm 1/2 socket and the 1/2 drive flex bar, used the 
hammer to bang the bar like it would loosen the nut, and bang to tighten the 
nut, to try to break the rust loose. Douse with liquid wrench. 

After a couple weeks put the pipe on the flex handle and CREAK!!!! worked it 
back and forth , then another notch over, back and forth, to undo the bolt 
successfully.   Used bushings from old shocks (but non VW ones).  The metal 
tube that go into the rubber bushings on the shocks.  The metal things that 
rust to the shock studs, as  the new Monroes did not come with bushings.   
Used tap &amp; die on the threads.

The old shocks did not move as much as the new ones.  The drivers side only 
moved a couple inches.

I could tell the vast improvement before I reached the end of the driveway.
