Subject: Re: [VB] Repro taillights - update

Problem is all the wiring got pretty &quot;hard&quot;, it's very brittle, cracks at every attempt of
bending.... this Bus has spent most of it's life in a warm climate and probably doesn't like the
cold days in Chicago. Looking to check wiring later on and compare with the diagram.... I need wiper
switch!! mine doesn't work at all....won't even move! Another one of those Arizona things... been
never used probably.

Thanks all,

| either something is wired wrong at ignition/ headlight switch, or your
| headlight switch is bad.  probably the first, compare to wiring diagram.
