I keep thinking I have the highly desirable benchseat/cab divider.
I tell myself it helps keep the drafts out some, but some door seals would
help alot more.  As a matter of fact in the days I had a 67 crawl-over I
made my own cab divider out of plywood they were so desirable.  You also
don't have to look at all the junk floating around in the back with the
highly sought after cab divider.
 Of course the RFH doesn't have drafts I'm sure unless you open the safaris!
Handy in Phx. in the summer or is it more like a convection oven that way?
Depending on where you live I suppose some M-Codes  are better than others.
