My speedo only goes to 70, but I have had it pegged back at the 0. The only
problem I have is that at 80 plus mph, the front end gets real light, don't
like the feeling. In all honesty I have had the DD up to 90 mph on a few
ocassions but like to cruise at 70-75.

&gt; Ok.  I know I'm asking for alot of &quot;yeah rights&quot;, but here it is.  What is
&gt; the fastest you have ever gotten your bus to? and have you ever gotten a
&gt; speeding ticket on the open highway?  Please back up the high numbers with
&gt; hardware.

Ok
90mph, verified by GPS on the flat, hot summer day, no wind, no drafting of
semi's  (actually not another vehicle in sight)

Hardware:
'60 double cab
2L type IV  7.5:1 cr
CIS Fuel Injection
'74 Thing IRS Trans with bus at stock height.

I now have bigger tires on and will be able to report back next week the
results
without fear of wrapping the needle around the zero peg.  I stopped at 90
because
I was driving the needle into the peg.  Had little dinky 165r15's.  Now
running
195r14s
