&gt; I am really happy with this tent, it's easily one of the nicest-built
&gt; tents I've ever owned, and I've been camping for a long time. It
&gt; definitely holds its own against anything I've had from Woods, Coleman
&gt; or Eureka, it packs away in a small and lightweight package that iss
&gt; huge when set up.  It's really a great addition to our camper, and
&gt; can't wait for our next camping trip.

when Greg says this tent is huge believe it!!! a few pics of it setup
last weekend. It rained on it with no leaking and only a pleasant
sound :) It also slides in the stock tent attachment thingie.
