I haven't used POR-15 yet, but I have used this product called Corroless. It
is available from eastwood. I used it on my front floor pans that had a little
rust on them. The rust hasn't come back-after about 1 1/2 years. 

I also used some on my drip rails, and around the front windshield, under the
gaskets. I haven't gone back to check under the windshield yet.


I heard about corroless from the type2 website. I think it is in a section
that talks about working on your windshields. Someone had tried a fcew
different techniques...and it kept rusting through. He then tried corroless,
and it worked for him. That is why i tried, also I had not heard of POR-15
yet.
