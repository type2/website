Subject: Clutch problem fixed!


Bus content:  I worked till 1:30 this morning pulling my motor on the
double cab (for the 4th time) to finally do what I should of done at the
time of the top end rebuild....replace the pressure plate and T/O.  Who
ever said bus people were cheep was  dead on!  I'm the quintessential
cheep bastard.  When I did the rebuild, I fixed/replaced everything but
the most costly thing....of course that turned out to be my problem.  At
least I've got new cable, bowden tube and everything is greased up all
nice.

The original '71 pressure plate (3 arm) looked fine, but it apparently
doesn't fully compress.  Can the arms freeze up?  It worked part way and
there was no rust.  I don't have one of those cool clutch compressors
that the bentley shows.  How can I compress the plate on the bench or
ground?

I bought a new Sachs multi fingered PP and a new German TO.  All now
works as it should....whoo hoo!  The only problem I encountered on my
test drive this morning was that at full pedel compression the new TO
squeals :-(  If I let up very slightly, it stops.  What did I do wrong??

Thanks for all the help from everyone.  Damm I'm good at pulling and
installing a motor by myself now, so I guess it was all good practice.

Steve
