Howdy, list-folk!

This is an update on the status of the BUS-LIFE list, the unloved stepchild
of the various &quot;Lists&quot;.

We are open and ready for any off-topic schtuff that you
can throw at us!  We talk about life with all manner of busses, from 1950
Barndoors
to 2001 Eurovans and beyond! (Concept Micro?)

Don't wait until Friday to vent, do it at Bus Life!  There's only one rule
(OK, two).

Check it out here:

http://groups.yahoo_dot_com/group/bus-life

(YAHOO GROUPS is free.  That's why we're using it.  Broke as Hell.)

This is not to become competition with any other lists, it's simply a forum
for discussing verboten topics on days other than Fridays.  Think cheese to
the other lists' tacos.  This is an all-cheese list.  And our Feng Shui is
amazing.

HENCE:  NO TECH ADVICE.  No technical talk whatsoever, this is for the other
lists.  We talk about sightings, trip reports, toys, living on, in or near
busses, frustration, anger, happiness, cops, music, Mustang drivers, camping
spots, hot dog prices, licking toads, giant antelopes, gravy recipes, Hell,
anything we
want AS LONG AS IT AIN'T TECHNICAL!

Uncle Billy really wants you to join.  And you know how sad it makes Uncle
Billy when you disobey him.

Headin' down that dusty trail,
