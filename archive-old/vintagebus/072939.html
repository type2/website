Subject: [VB] tuning the alumihell motor in PHX

Craig K. and I met up on Saturday in Tempe. We had long enough time to trade
lies, grab 2 tacos for a buck and talk for a while.

He seems OK excepting that he is terribly had to get along with and is as much
of an ugly SOB as I expected...

No, I'm kidding. Seems to be a very nice and intelligent guy who has several
aspects of life in common. It seems like that Ricky Fu breeder disease has
affected many of us bus folk. Look fwd to shoving the families together over
some carnivore delight and ale. I'm sure that the carpet crawling crowd will
enjoy mauling each other. MY how we change. In this case the carpet crawling
refers to the toddlers, not the usual suspects at the &quot;Last Resort&quot;. (Insider
joke). =)

I suggested that he touch base with Ronnie in regards to dialing in the carb
for the Phoenix environment. I stand ready to help but time did not allow for
tweaking the screws. In spite of my assumed reputation I never guarantee that I
am the man for every occasion.

Welcome to another bus family into the Arizona tribe. Now for the initiation
ceremonies and the obligatory tattoo/branding.
