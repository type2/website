Subject: Need a bus for a wedding...help?

Hi!

      I'm having a wedding in Southern California this summer, and I was 
wondering if you knew of anywhere I might look into for renting a classic 
VW bus for it. My fiance and I love buses, but unfortunately have none at 
the moment. I don't care if the bus is colorful--in fact that would be 
good, since we're going to have a unique wedding (...husband-to-be went to 
Woodstock, so people are kind of expecting us to show up in a bus!)  :)
