Subject: RE: [VB] Fuchs for sale

&gt;For all those interested in the Fuchs that I am selling. I believe they are
15&quot;, they are not chromed and missing center caps. I want $500 plus shipping
and handling. 

$500!  You must be kidding?  Since these are from a 68 or 69 they will be
the old style Fuchs and probably be 15&quot;x 5.5&quot; or 6&quot;.

Unless these wheels are perfect try more like $250-$300.

Everyone knows Wheel Enhancement is a huge rip-off, but absolutely perfect
wheels go for $800 a set.  Unless you get into weird sizes like 15&quot;/16&quot; by
8&quot; or  9&quot; then try like $500-$600 for one wheel.

Be different and do cookie cutters or phone dials on your bus, they are
almost free and very unique.
