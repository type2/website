&gt;5 lug &quot;wide&quot; pattern&lt;
So I am guessing you are after the 14&quot; rim that is 5.5&quot; wide with the wide-5
pattern?  These are $5 (with sometimes a good tire as a bonus) at the
junkyard.  In a pinch you can use wide-5 beetle wheels but they are only
4.5&quot; wide and do not have the vent in the wheels.  The 15&quot; early stock
wheels are usually pricey so I would stay away from them.  

&gt;I've checked Motorworks and Bus Depot and they don't seem to have them&lt;
Huh?  Bus Depot is usually pretty slim on splittie stuff, so try Ronnie at
oldvolks he has all the crazy splittie stuff.  I thought RMMW would have
some sort of wheel for the early bus though!  Granted it is probably
chromies or something equally not stock.

Wipers are again junkyard items, but are not pretty.  If you are doing a
decent resto go with new ones....  Granted $40 seems pretty high for a
stinkin' wiper arm!!?
