&gt; 1st question-- How much movement of the transmission shaft (I want to call
&gt; this the input shaft) is acceptable??  With the engine removed, I can take
&gt; this shaft and move it around 1/8 &quot;, maybe a little more.  Is that normal??
&gt; It seems like a lot to me, but I don't know.

Hi Bob.
Sounds normal to us!

&gt; 2nd question--How difficult is it to remove the Gland nut?   Reading Muir,
&gt; it looks like a major undertaking.  Can you do it with hand tools or is it
&gt; like the nuts on the rear axel??

It depends on how the last person torqued it, over torqued it, or did/did not 
put a little grease on the threads of the gland bolt to keep the rust monster 
away.  Yes it can be undone with hand tools and yes it is like the rear axle 
nuts!  We used a 3/4&quot; drive 36mm Craftman socket and a Proto 3/4&quot; L-shaped 
breaker bar.  We used to use the 1/2&quot; and later the 3/4&quot; Craftsman breaker 
bars which resulted in broken and bent bars. One 3/4&quot; turned slowly into a 
spiral after so many repairs and two others were cleanly broken off!!!  The 
Proto breaker bar only costs about $10.00 more and so far even with a 8'+ 
long cheater bar with one of us dangling from and a pair of super stuck 46mm 
rear axle nuts we have not been able to even bend it!!!  For the FW the only 
other tool you need is a FW lock you can pick up at any VW shop for about 
$10.00.
