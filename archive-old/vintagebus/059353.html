&gt; aywindows have a porportioning valve that adjusts with the deck angle of the 
&gt; bus, sending more braking to the rear wheels when loaded.

Hi George,
Actually it allows less pressure to the rear wheels!  Disc brakes require far 
more more pressure than drum brakes to lock up!  Without this regulator the 
rear drum brakes would lock up first and cause the VW to do a 180 or more 
degree spin.  Kind of like putting the fins on the wrong end of a dart and 
still expecting it to fly correctly.   Check chapter 8, section 5.1 in the 
1968 - 78 &quot;Official Service Manual&quot; for Station Wagon/Bus, for Testing Brake 
Pressure Regulator for the specifics.
