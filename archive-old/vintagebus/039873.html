Hi everyone, I was at the mall today and saw a 1/18th scale &quot;drag bus&quot; from 
(I think,) miesto or majesto or whatever.  I also got a little matchbox 
(black) bus and a conv. concept beetle.  I didnt but the drag bus, I'll save 
my money for a stock one (it was a splitty, (both buses)).

Matt
