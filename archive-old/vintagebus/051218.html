&lt;&lt; What do you know regarding the same Bentley item(s)on CD? I recently 
ordered a
set of manuals and then realized that they are soon to be released via CD. 
Word
is that the multimedia format is &quot;back ordered&quot;.
-ellis &gt;&gt;

I wouldn't count on any stated release dates for CD manuals from Bentley.  
I'm waiting for the EuroVan CDs to ship any day, but they have been promised 
for over a year now.

Bentley changed CD formats and discontinued any old format CDs, including the 
Vanagon.  The new format is only Windows 98 - on compatible.  The old version 
was Mac or PC.  Some vendors may still have the older versions available.
