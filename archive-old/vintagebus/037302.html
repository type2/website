&gt; Just wondering about gas mileage.
&gt; On average,is roughly 80-100 miles per tank of gas pretty normal?
&gt; I don't fill right up because of that &quot;fill it up too high leaking
problem&quot;
&gt; but I'd say the tank is about 7/8ths full.
&gt; Not hi-way miles, just in town back and forth to work and all that.

&gt; Wanted to see if I fall
&gt; within the average.

Andy, I think I need to know what size tank you have first. Mine is a 12
gallon tank, a late model, fitted into my 63.
But in any case you should know how many miles per gallon based on how many
gallons you put in. Assuming you put in 10 gallons, a average amount I would
guess, I should think that you should get about 200 miles out of it.
Figuring gas mileage is simple, fill your tank, record how many gallons went
in, and what your odometer reads. Run until you near empty. Fill agian, on
both fills by the way use the auto shut off on the pump, do not top off. On
the second fill see how many gallons go in. Subtract how many went in this
time, from how many went in last time. This is how many gallons you
consumed. Take you mileage reading and subtract the previous mileage you had
written down. Now you know you went x miles, using y gallons. Divide x by y
and you have MPG.
Thats so simple to do it makes more sense then comparing how many miles per
tank to others.
You MPG will vary by engine size, age, carb size, wieght in the bus, type of
driving you do, city or highway, but I thin k an average of 18 to 22 is
reasonable.
