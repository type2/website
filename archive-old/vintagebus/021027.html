&gt; Amen to that!  Earlier this year I met a very nice
&gt; fellow in Maryland, and an
&gt; old VW hand to boot, that picked up a wreck of a '67
&gt; DC and said he was putting
&gt; $20K into a complete resto.  Then I told him I
&gt; bought my show-quality DC on the
&gt; Left Coast and shipped it to Virginia for half of
&gt; that.  Hope I didn't get him
&gt; in dutch with his wife!

&gt; &gt;  i am amazed every
&gt; &gt; time i go back east and see the stuff people are
&gt; fixing. for the cost of
&gt; &gt; bodywork alone, they could have had a
&gt; clean-to-start-with car from out
&gt; &gt; west, plus some pocket change.
