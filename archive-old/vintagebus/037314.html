Some friends of mine have been using the bases from their broken safari 
window latches as spacers when they install the new ones.  They swear by 
this.  Just grind off whatever is left on the base until it is just a flat 
piece of metal with the two holes in it.  Then put that under the new latch 
when you install it.  Less tension=less breakage.  We have some generic 
aftermarket rubber here the guys say is a lot better than the regular stuff.  
It doesn't rain much here but they say it works well.  It has a metal 
reinforced channel that slips over the window frame (on the bus) and has a 
round squishy gasket sort of thing that is compressed by the window frame 
(the actual safari) when the thing is closed.  It was like $1.30 a foot at 
the local auto upholstry place (they also sell window rubber).  I could scan 
a picture if anyone was interested.

I haven't broken a safari latch (yet)    were the broken ones aftermarket?    
Mine close tightly- which I like as I suppose it helps against leaks, which 
is a problem here.    It is my impression that it really helps to have molded 
corners on the body to frame safaris seals, or it wrinkles up and leaks.  Do 
post how it works if you try these out.  I believe the aftermarket safari 
seals now have molded corners, I may buy some next summer.
