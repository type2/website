Subject: Watts to CP conversion

Dear Friends,

I have eventually been able to find some globes for my 1963 Kombi.
There are motorbike ones and marked in CP. (6Volt)

Could you provide me with some sort of table or formula on how to convert Watts to
CandlePower?

I assume my old 21W globe is now a 32 CP device. Is this correct?
What would the 5Watt parklight globe then work out to?

I am looking forward with interest to any suggestions.

From a chilly Johannesburg in South Africa, I bid you well.
Mike
Bernard
