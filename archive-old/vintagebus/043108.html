It is a good idea, but one that probably won't fly.
There are some aftermarket people that will actually go thru the patent
search...perhaps patent their part...get a company to do the part
manufacturing, packaging and then will maybe attempt to do the marketing,
shipping and billing/accounting themselves  and then deal with the
complaints from buyers, refunds, manufacturing problems, qaulity control
problems, market research and on and on....it isn't so easy and definitely
not a simple undertaking of just &quot;hey! let's do it!&quot;.
I have been in the process of getting a tool patented.  I've been at it
going on a year now.  I'm closer, but still not there yet.  And this is a
relatively simple (I thought) tool.
