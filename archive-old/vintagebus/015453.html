Westfalia electrical outlets were located above the
USA drivers side rear tail light 1965-mid year 1967.
Late year 67 it was relocated to the side to
accomodate the back-up lights. The exact outlet with
cover etc is still available from better RV suppliers
for about $15.00. It is not worth restoring this
outlet. I bought an exact replacement from Michigan
Trailer Sales on NW Grand Avenue in Phoenix.
