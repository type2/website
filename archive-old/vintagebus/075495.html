&gt; http://vintagebus_dot_com/gallery/image/2004984.JPG  I think I know what
&gt;it is but I'm a bit confused as to where to install it.

This looks like the tube on my '64 Bus.  It has the bracket on the
ceiling of the engine compartment for the air cleaner to mount on
the right.  The engine is from a '68 Bug, but it looks like it has
the right tin for a Bus.

You can see the routing of the pre-heat hose to the air cleaner on
my Bus at http://www.vintagebus_dot_com/gallery/image/2248.JPG .  It
comes off the bottom of the air cleaner snorkel, crosses in back
of the engine, goes through an apparently stock hole in the tin on
the left side, and connects to the tube.  When pre-heat tubes came
up previously, I took a few pictures of the installed tube:
