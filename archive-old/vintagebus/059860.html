Subject: Re: [VB] blowing hot air

Dumb question. What is the difference between the air hoses leaking and with turning on the heat
with correctly fitting hoses?

They were so loose that air
was blowing right past them. As I let the engine run I noticed the oil temp
climbing. I pulled the hoses and put two block offs in the shroud and the
fired up the engine again. After five minutes the oil temp started back down
into a safe area I could live with.
