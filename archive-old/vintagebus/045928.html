Subject: rust repair Q's
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

Does anyone make a replacement panel for the bottom part of the windshields 
frames? Mine look a little rusty (haven't pulled the windows out yet, I'm a 
little afraid to see what's under there) Is there a decent temporary solution 
so I can stop the water from running into my parcel tray?(maybe a little 
POR-15 putty?) I am going to replace all the rubber but I'd like to fix this 
before I do that.
Also are the side windows square? My friends deluxe has rust around the 
bottoms of the side windows and I was thinking we could use the tops of the 
side windows (from a donor bus) for replacement panels. Would this work? Do 
the tops have the same shape as the bottoms?
Thanks,
Brian
