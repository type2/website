Subject: Re: [VB] [Disc Brake Conversion]

Hi,

Note: My bus was nowhere near original when I &quot;assumed control&quot; of it 
in 1982.

I bought a Wolfgang brake conversion kit - unused on eBay. I wouldn't 
have been tempted, but it was half the cost. I couldn't pass it up. I 
then bought NOS 73 rotors, bearings and calipers off The Samba. I have 
stainless steel brake lines ready to go - but am short the 71-73 disc 
brake caliper mounting bolts.

This combo pushes the front wheels out (appears to be 20-25mm), so I'm 
sure there is going to be more wear on the king pins - but better 
handling. Overall, a quality kit from what I can tell.

I have both a 67 MC and a 71-later MC to compare and new brakes lines 
that I am putting in.

The ironic and sorta-humorous part about all this, is that my original 
goal was to use a '69 front beam to replace my original beam. But I 
missed the opportunity there, and now have much more $$$$ in the front 
than was the original plan. (My dad always said that I was irrational 
for keeping the bus, and I wouldn't want to disappoint him.)
