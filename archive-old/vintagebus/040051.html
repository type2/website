&gt;no one says they
&gt;have P205/75 R15 in a LT-   and one tire guy I asked was saying &gt;certain

&gt;are LT when they did not say it in the line stamped on the tire?  what 
&gt; &gt;gives?
&gt;  Is this a load of horse hockey?  What above 80 ratio tires- or is I &gt;get 
&gt;euro
&gt;size is that ratio 82% or something?  How do I know it is euro sized?  
&gt; &gt;What
&gt;does the P mean?

The P stands for 'passenger', and LT for 'light truck'.  They are two 
different beasts, which would account for why you can't find a 'P205/75 R15 
in a LT'.  A quick search of tirerack_dot_com shows 26 different light truck 
tires in that size, so they are very available.

And yes, there a lot of light truck tires that don't have LT stamped on the 
sidewall.  They should be missing the P at the beggining of the size and 
show a load range afterwards.  For example, the Michelin 185R14 C 99/97R 
tires on my bus are light truck tires, but a P185R14 90S tire would be a 
passenger car tire.

An 80% (82% Euro spec) aspect ratio is implied if none is named in the size. 
  For example, P155/80R13 and P155R13 are actually the same thing, or at 
least very close.

OK, that's all on tires for me for now, and hopefully for a while.  Happy 
bussing to all.
