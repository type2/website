Subject: Re: [VB] Emergency light switch and knob on a 66 bus

HUH?? Where did you get the idea I or the previous owner modified the wiring??

Read what I wrote:

&gt; Funny thing is, this knob does not light up like my 67 does. But the parts
&gt; book says 111 953 241 is the swtich spindle with knob (6v) for switch 111
&gt; 953
&gt; 235 which makes it sound like it lights up.
&gt;
&gt; In the 63-67 Bentley, E-1 page 13, shows the wiring diagram. J4 is the
&gt; hazard
&gt; switch. It only shows 2 wires and the case is grounded. No bulb filament.
&gt; Page 17 is 67, J5 is the hazard switch. In the center of J5 is K8, emergency
light warning lamp.

My 66 knob does NOT light up.
The Bentley 66 USA wiring diagram shows it does not light.

WHAT PART OF THIS DID THE PREVIOUS OWNER MODIFY??

At least read what is written.

&gt; The pics I took are of the 111 953 505 switch I took out of my 66 hardtop
&gt; deluxe, vin 246126769. As far as I know, it is original.
&gt;

&gt;
&gt; I don't believe the parts book. I believe I have the correct switch.

&gt; ***********************************************************************
&gt; One of the things I've noticed about buying used VW's, any type, any year,
&gt; is that the owner's) believe they have an unlimited license to modify the
&gt; wiring any way they choose. At least that has been my experience with 5
bugs,
&gt; two buses, two trucks, one Vanagan, and one fastback.
