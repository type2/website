Since someone else brought it up.  I've been doing some off the cuff
research (is there any other type?) on this hump seat thing.  I've come up
with a '61/'62 only thing.  Anyone else care to comment?  BTW I've only seen
these seats with the 3 position &quot;cheese grater&quot; (my name) brackets.  Is this
correct???

Anyone have a hump seat (complete) they might want to part with???  Need the
brackets too.  I have a nice 1/3 2/3 to trade or cash.

Thanks!

&gt; both of my 63s have a 1/3-2/3 seat but I have seen a hump seat as well.
