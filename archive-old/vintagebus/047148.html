 i have a 65 split bus and a friend of mine has a 71
 bus. we are very lazy and would like to drive an
 automatic. please could you give me any hints, tips or
 horror storys to look out for.
 
 thanks 
 claire  &gt;&gt;

it is so much work to convert to automatic, it can hardly be called the lazy 
option.  Personally, I really would not want an automatic.  When I had a 
broken leg and could not use that left pedal for 6 months (yes it was a very 
bad break) I considered buying an autostick beetle, but didn't.
