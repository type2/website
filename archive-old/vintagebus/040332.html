Subject:  Source for transaxle parts?
Date: Fri, 24 Nov 2000 09:07:26 +1100
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

Greetings All,

I'm just at the stage in my 59 23 window resto where
I want to pull down the transaxle and check it before I put it back
in the bus.

I'm having real trouble sourcing parts here in Aus. Pinion bearings 
seem to be particularly hard to find.  I see 'rebuilt' 
bus transaxles all the time in the US mags so the parts must be available?
I'm looking for standard rebuild bits like bearings, gaskets, syncros,
shims.  Can anyone
suggest a US supplier with web/email presence? 

Thanks

RobK
