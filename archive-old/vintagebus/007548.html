Subject: Update:  Rescue!?

I just got back from checking out that '66 Sundial.....all I can say is that
it is crying for help!  The wrinkle in the top is not too bad...the engine
wants to go, but the points are shot, the general feel of the motor is
&quot;needs a serious tune-up&quot;.  I think it is a 1600 sp with new heads.  The
tranny feels like the linkage couplers are shot, the brakes hold, but there
are signs of leakage at the slave cylinders on at least 2 wheels.

The passenger windshield is garbage, as are the seals on both, the nose is
gushed in at about bumper level (there is a front bumper, but the rear is in
Fresno).  The floor on the driver's side is not, and the pass. side is soon
to return to the earth.  Missing one pane from the louvered windows, and the
interior is funky, but serviceable.  Has a stereo in the tray, been
converted to 12-volt, and all parts seem to be there, except for the outer
handle on the cargo door.

Rockers seem ok,  the front shocks need to be attached (they're sorta just
hanging from the top, but the bushings on the bottom aren't really doing
anything).

The bus has one feature that I've never seen before:  On the plate that
covers the overhead vent system, there are 2 air deflectors that pull out
and swivel.  It doen't look like a hack job, so it's just something I've
never seen before, right?  Or are these deflectors worth the $500 I could
get the bus for?

Does anyone want to rescue this bus?  It is located in Guerneville, CA, and
this opportunity has a time limit:  T minus 14 days
