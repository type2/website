Subject: Re: [VB] Number 2 cylinder

Have you checked the compression on all 4 cylinders?

&gt; Looking for some suggestions.  I have a rebuilt engine (everything new
&gt; except the case) and just running it for the first time.  It was running a
&gt; little rough so I decided to try taking off plug wires to see if I could
&gt; figure it out.  When I take of plug wire 2 it smoothes out and sounds
really
&gt; good for 3 cylinders.  I checked my 009 distributor with a timing light
and
&gt; I am at 7 degrees btdc at 800 rpms and it maxes at around 25 btdc at full
&gt; throttle.  I also checked the valves after it cooled and they are good at
&gt; 006.
