Just got done installing them...  The Plexiglas solution worked prefect.
I'd have to drive in mountain crosswinds to see how much temp difference it
makes, but the NOISE REDUCTION is VERY DRAMATIC!  I expect this will make a
huge difference on temps.

FYI to all &quot;Plexiglas&quot; is actually a brand name like Xerox.

Home Depot sells Lucite-ES.  What worked best for me was the 36&quot; x 72&quot; sheet
for $32.  This is double strength, .125 thickness.  Home depot cuts this for
FREE.  I had them cut to 16&quot; by 12.75&quot;.  This is just a tad higher than the
screen (12.5&quot;) but with the extra .25&quot; it fits better than the screen!  I
was able to get 10 pieces... allowing one to do TWO Westy's or double the
pains...

Again, I went with  .125 (inch?) thick.  I debated getting the .250 thick
several times, but the cost was more than I wanted to spend and they didn't
have a size that would yield 5 pieces without waste... it would have cost
$70 to get 5 pieces .250 thick (which is pretty close to the thickness of
the screen, preventing vibration).   Or I got the 10 pieces at .125 thick..
which is more than enough... and I can double them up for even better
vibration resistance.

If you haven't removed your screens, they are REAL EASY.  All you do is lift
them and pull them out from the bottom.  The top grove gap is an extra .75
inch.  It takes less than 1 minute to switch a window from screen to
Plexiglas... and well worth doing in colder weather!  In less than 5 minutes
you can have them switched... $32 bucks well spent...

P.S.  I strongly recommend you don't try to use a 24&quot; pience cut into 12&quot;...
you really need 12.75&quot; for proper fit.

&gt; I was going to visit Home Depot and see if I could come up with a

Something I haven't done yet, but thought I might, is wrap the screens with 
Saran Wrap and reinstall them.  That ought to stop the draft unless the wrap

tears.
