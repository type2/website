After taking those pictures of my bus doodads, I went out and started
prepping for the engine install.  It seems with each engine install, my
posts become anti-climactic in that the engine pulls and installs are
becoming a regular staple of my VW dosage.

Anyway, just as I needed help to lift the engine off the makeshift stand,
the neighbor kid Erik came by and wanted to borrow some tools.  He was able
to borrow all he needed once that engine was down on the jack! :-)  He had
to take off so I just sat there wondering how to install the engine in the
bus by myself because up until now I had help with the slightly more bulky
package of the 1776.  I decided to have a go at it.  I just took my time,
went way slower than usual and with the use of a trouble light and a pocket
mirror (GREAT tool I found out!) I got the engine in.  The best part about
the mirror was that I could sit behind the engine on the ground and when I
needed to check the alignment of the tranny input shaft and 2 lower studs, I
simply held the mirror with one hand and gawked around.  I had turned the
lights on in the shop at 8:00 and by 10:15 the engine was in, wired, oil
filter bracket installed, etc..  I monkeyed around with the primered rear
apron and got it installed and then decided to install my louvered decklid
which was a gift in September of '99 from a then-new-listee named Bill May.
I decided for this trip that I had better install it as Bill said he could
travel all day with his old bus towing his drag car and it would actually
run 10 degrees cooler or something along those lines.

That was about it - I simply got too tired to carry on so I'll do some more
work tomorrow on my day off from work.  This is the BIG day where I get a
lot of stuff done hopefully.  Thanks for reading...
