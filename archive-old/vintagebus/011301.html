 OK, this isnt really a trip report, but it's a bit of a story.
 I took some friends up to the Sunshine Coast this weekend in my bus, to 
 visit a friend Sat. night and camp out Sun. nite.
 All went well until Sunday morning when I was trying to get out of my .....
 
 I knew that my left axle had popped out again.  I've had ongoing 
 problems with it and it was only held in by three of six bolts on the
outside, 
 zealously.  Anyway, all 
 six bolts were sheared off inside the axle stub.  
 To the amazement of my friends, I managed to find a parts store in 
 Sechelt (a very small town) ends out the back of the axle plate 
 except one, which was stuck.  So I went with 5 out of six, and we were 
 back on the road.  All within the space of about 3 hours.

cool. hope it doesn't break up again.  should i suggest trying to avoid steep
hills with that setup?  nah- didn't think so.   i thought you retired your
bus- guess that changed- cool  :)
.........
 That night we went camping and the road was super rough.  I bottomed out 
 about four times, bent my muffler and sheared off the horn wire where it 
 exits the bottom of the steering column.  I was driving a bit too fast 
 since it was getting dark and we still had to set up camp.  So I guess 
 this weekend I'm fixing the horn wire.  Anybody know the best way to 
 feed a new wire through?  
 -- - - --
feed it up from the bottom.    leave a bit extra at the horn botton.
sometimes you can undo the screw at the horn button and sometimes you can't=
so you might have to splice it but be careful it doesn't ground out or the
horn will come on and stay on which sucks i know.   if the little ryubber
grommets that cover the wire connection on the horn itself are there reuse.
use brown wire to retain wire colour accuracy (means a ground wire, fwiw, in
bosch language)   pull horn button off, pull out old wire, feed new wire from
bottom.  if you feel adventurous, use this tome to change the steering gear
box oil ( lube it lube it lube it)  get a oil drain pan and put it under the
s.g.box.  undo the 4 10mm bolts holding the bottom plate on   remove the clip
for the horn wire, and remove the bottom plate.   it is funny shaped goinging
into the sgbox   clean everything immaculately and the shims too whenm putting
it back together ior it will leak.  

 or i think if you undo one bolt oil will come out, which will drain it but
not the crud but less to reassemble.  get the clip out of the way so the new
wire cann be clipped in place.   then attach the horn on top, make sure the
wire is long enough, attach to horn.   Redo the bolts with the horn wire
clipped in place.  fill the s.g. box (little square headed plug, use gear oil)
  ..  . . . . . . . . . .. .
 Also I'm wondering what type of muffler has the best clearance?  The 
 muffler I have now is a basic style, it curves to the right side and 
 sits pretty low to the ground, although it is bent up about 2&quot; higher 
 than it should be, so that the back of the bus (is it called the rear 
 apron, or is that just for a bug?) is all bent up to accomodate it.  
 Also, the right side heater box bracket has popped out so it's super 
 loud.  Maybe a back bumper would help protect the muffler, but I'm not 
 really convinced that it would.  All suggestions welcome.

sounds like you have a header type.    i prefer the stock muffler.   for bus
it has one tailpipe- to left.  so the pipe popped off the r side heater box?
fix it- reattach if possible.  incorrect backpressure from exhaust is not only
loud, it is bad for you engine.   take this time to replace the mufler if it
is toast, or you just want to get more ground clearance.    a rear bumper is
good- also v useful for protecting back and corners of bus.
