I'm running on Win98 without too much trouble. I wouldn't be scared to
upgrade, you just have to have the room to do it. My only problem is a carry
over from 95 that I can't seem to fix. I use Outlook Express for e-mail and
it locks up when I delete messages or when I sent a new message. Short of a
format an re-install I've tried just about everything.


VW note:
    There was a 62 Crew Cab in the St. Louis paper the other day for $2500.
Along with 2 other VWs (not included in the price). I called and left a
message but the guy never called me back. I hate that.

   I am going to Atlanta this weekend for the NASCAR race. The wife is into
that. I don't suppose anyone else is going? I wonder if I could pose as one
of the pit crew and park the Bus next to one of those Big&amp;ss Busses. I bet I
could find some way to get a VW part on one of those race cars. :)

Hey Dave!! How about a beer on Sat. night. We're staying at the Drury in
Marietta.
