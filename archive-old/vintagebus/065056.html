Subject: Re: [VB] Funny trans noise

It almost sounds like a throw-out bearing noise. I had
a similar problem before in my old transaxle. 
 I too need a new transaxle and have heard good things
about ITS in SoCal. Many SV2's guys said very good
things about Chris. The only problem is I'm in Norcal!
