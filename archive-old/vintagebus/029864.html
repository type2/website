Hey, Everett Barnes, weren't you looking to buy a Binz?  There you go...

&gt; There were about 10 each of crew cabs and single cabs, trucks
&gt; everywhere!  There was also another Binz that showed up.  It was the one that
&gt; came out of Texas a year or so ago.  We parked next to each other so we could
&gt; compare.  Very cool to be able to touch two Binz (Binzes, Binzi?) at the same
&gt; time.  It is the first time I have ever seen two together.  (It is for sale
&gt; if anyone is interested in a Binz.  Email me)
