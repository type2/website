so ronnie you are saying that 'cyclone' and 'heavy duty' are 
synonymous as far as vw was concerned. the thing air cleaners i've 
seen have a more rectangular snout but otherwise actually look more 
like the  oildrum-shape 1200cc model than the egg-like 1500cc HD 
filter.

anyone have a photo of the weird hose shown in the bentley... or HAVE 
one to describe for us?
