When you say &quot;fluted glass at the top&quot; what do you mean?  Is only part of
the lense fluted?  Are they US-spec (plain) or Euro-spec (fluted)?

Several pair of NOS european-spec healight assemblies - the whole shootin'
match - have gone for $150 on ebay.  I'd suspect the lenses alone would go
for less than that.  I've paid $100 for a set of euro lenses when I didn't
know any better.
