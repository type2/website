&gt; 
&gt; The gearing of the splitty is such that at around 3600 RPMs,
&gt; you get around 60 MPH as the top end with a stock tranny and
&gt; tire setup. That just happens to be the point on the HP
&gt; curve where the engine is at its maximum efficiency. It's
&gt; also the most your going to get with the stock intake and
&gt; carb.
&gt; 
&gt; The splitty took around 36 HP to do this. Kind'a neet how
&gt; that works out. It takes &quot;X&quot; amount of fuel, and air, to
&gt; produce 36 HP. If you restrict the air opening to the
&gt; engine, you restrict the power output. The size of the carb
&gt; and air runners is engineered to feed enough air and fuel to
&gt; do 36HP, and no more. The VW splitty is engineered to run at
&gt; WOT in fourth gear without damage.

&gt; I'm sure others will disagree. This is what works for me.

Doug,

I tend to agree, but there are some (whose opinions I respect) who do
not. 
Can you sight references from either VW literature, engineering
documents or other vw-engine testing data to back you up on this? 
I know Gene Berg always said that a vw engine was sound up to 6000RPM
with some mods, and could easily get to these revs with a larger intake
and exhaust. 

You talk about the 36hp engine ( or do you?) Is this also true of the
40hp, 1300, 1500, and 1600?

I run a 1600 DP in my 65( w/ big nut transaxle and 26.5&quot; diameter
tires), with stock 34 pict3, dual vac dizzy, and stock single tip bus
exhaust, and I definitely CAN over-rev mine at highway speeds, when not
loaded. I have done 80, and do not want to know what my rpm's were....
