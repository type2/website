like the puller for the clutch shaft arm, a life saver you were for Dawn and

ah, there's room for people, too.  maybe i should make a comprehensive list
of what i actually carry around and really freak people out.  i have helped
many a broken down bus with the stupid crap i seem to have in my parts box.

&gt; Jon were do you sit in the bus and you can not take any friends (no room
&gt; at the inn) but we would like you in our caravan, or to happen on us
&gt; along the road needing help. nice list!
&gt; We carry food and water for those unexpected stops and do not forget the
&gt; VW coveralls!
&gt; P &amp; C
&gt; 
&gt; i carry just about any tool i may need to rebuild or fix anything on the
&gt; &gt; bus,
&gt;
