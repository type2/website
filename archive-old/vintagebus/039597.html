&gt; &gt;No, Butt Fugly.
&gt;
&gt;

I dont want to question whether its ugly or not, I lean toward ugly but...., 
if it gets to market, and I wanted a minivan, I think I would look at all 
the minivans and make a choice. VW has finally gotten around to make a 
decent car so maybe I would test drive it. But as far as choosing this van 
over another is hard to say. Price, performance, room, MPG would be my 
deciding factor, not if it kind of looks like a bus.
I would rather drive my 63 anyday.
