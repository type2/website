Subject: Puyallup/buses in odd places/selling all the VWs

Today I took Bruce back to the doctor about his cut tendons.   In the parking 
lot was a really nice velvet green 65 Riviera camper!!!!   Turned out it's 
been in Oly forever, was the Eddy's Grocery's bus, that Eddy bought at 
Brewington Motors in Oly when it was new, and has been garaged most of the 
time since.  A very nice, original bus.  I didn't recognise it at first, but 
the bus's guy came out from the doctor's too.  I had met him some years back 
but forgot the association of him and the bus.  That was a bright spot in the 
day :)  

The Puyallup (Pew-al-up) show was nice, not a lot of buses, but a huge swap 
meet.  I heard that it's better to go bus watching in the parking lot than in 
the show!  I didn't buy anything but a 21mm wrench that was a dollar.   Lots 
of folks there, lots of gabbing.  The weather was unexpectedly sunny and 
warm.  (I think I got a touch of sun burn)

Today I asked my SO Bruce if I should get rid of the ratty 63 SC (no motor), 
and he emphatically said NO, cause he wants to drive it.  Surprised me!  He 
wasn't into old VWs when we met, but now he's been coming to the shows with 
me.  He does like to take up garage space with woodworking projects though, 
which is a PITA, and recently has been threatening to start building a wooden 
boat.

I had dated a couple guys who were not tolerant of my VW habit, but that 
didn't last long.   The funny one was a guy who at first thought it was neat 
I was into cars, then would bitch about me getting greasy or going 
junkyarding.  :)
