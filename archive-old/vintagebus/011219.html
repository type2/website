Hi Scott,
Check any of the Bentley manuals and you will find there is a proper hieght 
that must be adhered to and a certain amount of movement.

&lt;&lt; The bus does run and idle fine. It is not flooding which would seem to be 
the result if the pressure was too high. &gt;&gt;
Niether did ours but we had fuel smelling oil and a carb that dripped at the 
throttle shaft for about five minutes after shutting down the engine.  Turned 
out the float was way too heavy and allowing fuel to constantly pour down the 
intake manifold.

PS. Just a guess, but if you are running a 1600 those main jets are way too 
big! EEE&amp;B
