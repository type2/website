 Hi,  I'm searching for a good used ready to install small nut
 transmission. I'd like one that's complete drum to drum, and affordable.
 If you're within a few hundred miles of Fort Worth, Texas that would be
 best, but if you're further and willing to ship it that would be fine
 too. I've got a complete front and rear end from a 66 bus to trade, or
 cash. The 66 front end seems fine but on the rear end I am unable to turn
 the drums by hand. Please e-mail me off-list if you have one or know of
 one. Thanks-
 Chris  &gt;&gt;

Hi Chris, is this for a bus that you are getting going after it has been 
sitting a while?   if so, the most common cause of drums not turning is the 
brakes sticking, particularly if the ebrake was on for years.  SO, best idea 
is to bang the drum with a hammer to knock it loose.

What is wrong with the tranny you have in your bus?  Or do you just want the 
smaller gear ratio?  

the thing is, you could get a tranny someone says is good, but I would still 
take the boxes apart and check the bearings.   I got a small nut tranny ' 
works good' from someone who lowered his bus, and took the RGBox apart and 
found a couple bad bearings.  I was just collecting axle shafts at that time, 
and those can be worn bad.

Though I would rather have a good used than a rebuildt center section
