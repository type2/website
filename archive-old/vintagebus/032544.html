if some private party doesn't step up to the challenge, try looking in
hemmings.  could probably get it out there for under $600.  lots of
advertisers in hemmings for stuff like this.

&gt; I would like to get a bug from Oklahoma to Oregon.  It needs to be cheap
&gt; though... the car is only worth ~500 but has some 'history' behind it that
&gt; would be worth preserving.
