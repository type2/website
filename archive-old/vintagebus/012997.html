&gt;Buses with the body off are actually still very strong, The wineries near
&gt;here take a van and cut the bodies open or off so that the floor is easy to
&gt;access. Some have done this with the old buses as they don't need coolant
&gt;and the redux boxes are like a tractor, then they drive them to load up a
&gt;pile of grapes, then park it at the side of the road to sell the grapes.
&gt;I picked up one of these for the redux trans as the rest was hacked off in
&gt;the 70's
&gt;I have a 78 here right now that has only the floor left! I am going to make
&gt;a Christmas Parade float
&gt;I hate the Dreams i have,,,
