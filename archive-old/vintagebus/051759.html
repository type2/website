Subject: carb problem...solved

hi all-

Thanks for all of the info and help about the 34 pict-3 card/009 distibutor 
problem. We got it fixed. What we did was:

1. rebuilt the carb- new gaskets and such 

1.5 changed fuel cut off thingy (someone had just snipped the end of it off 
because it had failed a long time ago)

2. changed the jet from 127.5 to 135

3. got a stroboscopic timing light (something new because I always set it 
statically) and timed the car so that full advance was 28 to 30 degrees.

She idles, gets up and goes, and doesn't diesel anymore when he turns it off.


THanks again

Nicholas Miller
