Mark,  you beat me to the same response. Unfortunately, Vanagon westys prices
have  gone thru the roof lately.  Scuttle butt on the vanagon list this  week
has been about a guy paying $73K for a totally redone syncro westy to  the
volks at Go Westy.

The vanagon volks think split window drivers  drive them cuz they can't
afford a vanagon!  

Whodathunk?

hey Tom  I saw that crazy shit also and I think somebody bumped their  head.  
There is a westy on the fullmoon site that needs a clutch for  $1500.   3 
weeks ago there was one in Charlotte for $600  needing  some TLC and a clutch.  
Shop rate for a clutch is about $600  Takes  about 4 hours to do that job as 
you can just remove the tranny on a vanagon. .I  see weekenders all the time 
that don't have the pop top for good prices.  Splitties have gone out the roof 
for a good one and bays are following  them. I would take a vanagon over a bay 
any day even the aircooled ones   Later  Mark Dearing
