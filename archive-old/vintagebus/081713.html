Subject: Re: [VB] Bus in video

  There is a split in a country video. On CMT or one of the country channels( or maybe it was VH1) they had the 
hottest 20 female country singers and one of the top ten has a split bus for a split  (no pun intended) second in the 
back round. I saw it 2 days ago. Of course the number one female was Shania (sp), but Dolly was still up there along 
with Faith and a whole bunch of I never heard of's, but they were all hot though.

&gt;My wife just told she saw a VW Bus in a country video today. It was on GAC, a
&gt;new country TV channel (for us anyway).  There website (gactv_dot_com) says the
&gt;video will play again on Thursday in the 6:30pm half time frame.
