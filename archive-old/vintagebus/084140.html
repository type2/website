Subject: I Got Problems

I bought one of the CB Performance Pump &amp; Spin on oil filter adapter like Eric &amp; Barb recommended and I just went to install it, got everything off and the studs that held the old pump on are 6mm and the bolts that came with the CB pump are 8mm. I have an H case in my 63 and am completely at a loss. I can only think of one solution and thats to take out the 6mm studs then drill and tap the holes to match the 8x1.25 bolts that came with this pump. The pump that I removed was a relo at least thats what was stamped on the pump gears. I have never heard of this pump. I also had a bear of a time removing it with the pump puller from Vintage World Tools. The T for the puller had to be filed down considerably even than it did not sit in both holes properly. Old pump is probably not re-useable. Anybody got any knowledge to share?
