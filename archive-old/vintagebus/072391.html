Subject: rubber undercoat in doors?

Hey everyone...

I was installing a stainless stel sink in my kitchen
and noticed the underside of the sink is coated with a
substance not unlke the aerosol &quot;rubberized undercoat&quot;
you can buy at the AutoZone. It's black about 1/16 or
1/8 thick with a bumpy texture.
i imagine is providees sound/vibration insulation for
when the water stream or dishes are hitting the floor
of the sink. SO...

I wonder if you could insulate the inside panels of
your doors/ body panels this way. Has anyone tried
this?  Would it be a smart way to keep water from
ruining the bottom inside of your cab doors?

What do you guys/gals think?
