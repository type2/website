Subject: Crew cab value, new budget, crazy AZ options?

I really appreciate all the help from this list.  I'm learning a lot, and I
hope others understand that it is hard to shop when these things are spread
all over and are often sold quickly when a good deal comes.  I also need
constant help knowing what bodywork is easy and what is now, plus what is
stock.  The real issue is getting first-hand reviews of truck far away!

===== OK, change of plans -- NEW BUDGET =====

I've exhausted my resources, which means a lot of listees, going after $3500
body.

I'm more convinced than ever that I want a daily driver Crew that isn't a
bodywork project.  I'm willing to use my sandblaster to maintain and prevent
further, but major welding restoration is not within my skills.  Believe me,
please don't convince me I can turn a $1500 crew cab into a show winner with
just a little effort.  I'll stick to computers, thank you.

So, given that I had a bonus come from work just this week, I'm increasing
my budget.  $4500 is target but with right combination will go as high as
$5250.  And it needs to be HOME in Seattle for $5750 (either by carrier
truck, me flying and driving it home, or local!).

  -Jarome option--

AN option now is to go to Jarome and arrive on Phoenix Friday morning, spend
the night, then drive home EARLY Saturday morning (one hell of a drive).
This means I would want some help getting this baby ready for a LONG DRIVE
while in AZ on Friday.

I have to work Thursday, and I have to be back to work Monday.  The earliest
I could arrive (after leaving work Thursday) in Phoenix is Midnight Thursday
(Thursday 11:55pm). Then 1600 mile drive home!

  --Likely candidates--

Ideal would be for me to line-up a SPECIFIC bus this weekend.  Anyone know
of one for sale in AZ?  James Burnite still have his for sale?  Anyone have
e-mail and phone number for Jim?

Given the 1600mile ride home, I'm thinking a '64 or later with some large
diameter rear tires will keep the RPM's within reason.

Does it exist?  Great AZ body Double Cab for $5250?  Anywhere else?

Uggh!
