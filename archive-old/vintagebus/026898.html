Subject: clutch pedal won't return
Message-id: &lt;38948e05.582b.0_at_beer_dot_com&gt;

Hey everyone, Diana K. from Vancouver BC here, finally signing back on to the
list after being off since Sept. 

The orange/ivory '66 Westy is now my daily driver to and from work, and I'm
having a problem with the clutch pedal: it stays on the floor when I push the
pedal down or returns very slowly.  The pedal itself is not getting hung up
or rubbing on anything and neither is the lever underneath.  

Has anyone experienced this?  could the problem be located in the pedal area
(ie there's a barrel type thing that the clutch lever attaches to at the frame,
should I take that apart??) or with the clutch itself?

I'm reluctant to pull it apart without knowing, as I don't have any other transportation
and i can still drive it by not pressing the pedal all the way down and pulling
it back up with my toe.

Any suggestions welcome, TIA
Diana
