&lt;&lt; the later tanks due to the perminate fuel taps and the fuel injection

back to why the wood, to have a platform for the tank to sit on so it doesn't 
rock and roll or warp or grind
 a hole in the bottom, etc. &gt;&gt;
Hi Ronnie,
Thanks for the info!  We will avoid the later tanks then.  A wood platform up 
here in the NW of USA would hold too much moisture against the bus.  Just did 
a autopsy on a nice 1967 bus tank.  Used a bronze chisel to cut it in half 
and to avoid sparks!  The inside was perfectly clean of rust.  Even still had 
the steel manufacture ink stamps inside!  The darn crush strips of material 
under the tank had held the moisture that gets drawn into the engine intake 
vents like a sponge to rust the tank inward!  Now painting tanks in these 
areas underneath and the areas where the material sits on the body with 
roofing tar to prevent this from happening again.   Eric&amp;Barb
