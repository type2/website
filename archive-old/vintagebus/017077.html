I've seen both an army green color and black.  Unfortunately none of my
buses ever came witht he original.

I can only DREAM of being at the point where I coudl get AR over the color
of a 5&quot; strap of cloth on my '54!

&gt; Sorry for the stupid minutia question.  I realize it has nothing to do with keeping a Bus on the road, but it is still nonetheless Bus related.
&gt; 
&gt; What was the original color of the cargo door check strap mounting bracket that screws into the cargo door?  Black?  Color of the lower portion of the Bus?  Different for early Westies?  I'm at that point with the Westy and inquiring minds need to know.
