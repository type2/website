Subject: 67 Westy progress(long)

Making great progress!!! 

Let me start this post with a word of advice: when removing the nut to pull 
the rear drums with a 24&quot; monkey wrench and a 6' long stainless cheater bar, 
be sure to take the front end off of jackstands first or you will lift the 
front of the bus off of the jackstands and make it fall onto the wheels that 
were placed under the frame incase that happened. And if you are like me and 
forgot you placed your hubcaps full of nuts and bolts there, you will also 
ruin the only two good hubcaps you had and lose alot of your hardware! Trust 
me on this, I now know. 

Anyway, I did get them removed finally, and the results were very pleasing. 
Everything in the rear drums looks new! Even the pads. I think someone 
started restoring this bus at one time because it is lookiong better and 
better. Now I just need to order everything for the front brakes. While 
working on the front end, I found play in the king pins and such. Hmm..let me 
see how the grease looks. The things wer totally empty! A couple shots of 
grease everywhere and everythign tihtened right up. God I love this bus. I 
still have about 2-3&quot; of play in my steering, but I tracked that down to 2 
tie rod ends that run from pitman arm to the other pitman arm?? I'm not sure 
what they call them, but I know what they are. My axle beam was also near 
empty on grease. I got to working on my 65 to pull the front brake baking 
plates which was missing on my 67, and it isn't as easy. I fought with it for 
about two hours yesterday, and did get one side off. Still fighting with the 
other side. THe drum is finally unfroze, but still not wanting to come off. 
There has to be an easier way....
On that note, my 65 has dual wheel cylinders on both sides. Is this correct 
for my 67 as well? I hadn't factored that into my estimate, but I did count 
on replacing everything on the rear brakes, whcih I don't have to do now, so 
I guess that makes up for it. 
I plan on taking all drums and torsion arms and backing plates and other 
assorted pieces to get sandblasted today(hopefully), and hopefully by the 
time I get out of the field next week all my parts will be in. I stil need to 
test my master cylinder out and I am hoping it doesn't need replaced($$$) but 
it is looking pretty good. 
Any suggestions as far as what shocks are best recommended for this? I 
usually use KYB on all my type 1's but I'd liek to hear what the type 2 pros 
think. 

Another question before I forget, my brake pedal rubs on a bolt in the frame 
when I depress it. Is it just bent? I have to replace my spring on the pedal 
as it is wore out and I was thinking I would put an extra washer or two in 
there to kinda space the pedal away a little, but is this a common problem? 
Anyways, back to work! I just might have this on the road in two weeks! That 
woudl be great! Thanks for listening!
