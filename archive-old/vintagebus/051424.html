Subject: Re: [VB] Front engine compartment seal

Hi Thomas,
We use the earlier two lipped engine seal that was for the pre-1968 VWs.  
Sounds like you have the later model of this and it goes down, but may cause 
sealing problems due to being too thick with the forward sheet metal.  Either 
way make sure to cut a slit for the accelerator (And another slit for choke 
cable if you have one!) to go through or enjoy return problems.  Plus match 
the U-curve of the seal when layed out on the floor with the curve of the 
rear apron and foward seal section.  The side pieces use the cut off straight 
sections from this U-shape.  Eric&amp;Barb
