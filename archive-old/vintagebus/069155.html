Subject: Re: [VB] International Travel Questions

I complete agree with what Barb wrote about traveleing overseas.  (except I 
didn't know the bit about shorts). 
I also found helpful a 'Wicked German' phrasebook, which taught me show to 
say things like &quot;hazelnut schnapps won't help him now&quot;, and how to call 
someone a robber baron.  Really, these were good things to know.   Also, 
spargelsuppe is very tasty.

&lt;&lt;     in their help if you stop someone on the street or ask a clerk for

manners 
 on,
          then no one will pay any extra attention to you.
 
 Good luck and go and have the trip of your life!!
