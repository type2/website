cleaning of both the housing contacts and grounding surfaces sounds like it's 
in order. &gt;&gt;

Hi Thom,
That and the fact that some of these tail lights are built in four sections!  
The insulated part with the Positive wires to the bulb.  The section that the 
base of the bulb locks into.  The section refector part which has the 
grounding and lastly a riveted in sharp point to ground through the seal and 
paint to the metal of the body of the bus.  So for the bulb to ground 
properly a total of four differant places in these bulb holders and to the 
body that have to allow a good ground to go through.  For the daily driver it 
is just best to solder a negative connection to the section of the bulb 
holders that the bulb base locks into and run a wire directly to the battery 
negative cable.
