Hey list!
Well I'm finally taking off for school on Thursday morning at the University 
of Oregon... I've been in contact with a few listees to contact in the VW 
scene of the PNW (Eric and Barb---thanks for the show planner), but would 
like to meet more in the area... I'm excited for the change of scenery from 
IL and know that my vw findings will be much more productive than in the 
midwest. BTW---I will be looking for a nice driver in the next few months in 
the greater Eugene area if anyone has any leads (the older and more og, the 
better!!!) in the near future. If all goes well, I will be at the Puyallup 
show in WA in October for my first show out west.
I am leaving my two VW's at home for the moment, but would love to come home 
this summer with a cool bus! Boy am I gonna miss that panel and the great 
midwest vw folks until next summer! I will most likely make it down for the 
Classic weekend next summer also...

Anyway, just thought I'd let you guys know I'll be taking off for school in a 
new land, but will remain active on the list!!
Thanks alot and take care,
Pete
