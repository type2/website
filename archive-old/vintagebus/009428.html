Hi All,

I'm in the middle of restoring my 59 double cab and have long contemplated 
a set of safaris.  The problem is that I would really like to find a set of 
original but have not been able to find them.  Because I live out in the 
middle of no where, I can't easily get to any of the shows to look i.e. 
SOTO or NEATO.

Accordingly, anybody have a set in good condition? I'm willing to pay for 
them what ever that means ;-)

My next option would be to get a set of Izzy's or similar but then again, I 
haven't been impressed with any reproductions that I have ever seen.  I 
haven't seen the Izzy units so does anybody have any thoughts regarding if 
I should hold out for some originals or close my eyes and just do it.

Thanks

Dave
