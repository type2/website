Which reminds me.  My bus is the European model - bought on the gray
market and imported by a dealer.  They put some sort of tape over the
semaphore holes (I have the original semaphores), left the wires bare,
and retrofitted US-spec lights.  Well, I don't know if they're
actually VW's US-spec; they were sufficient to make it street legal
for that year.  My question is: can I re-install the semaphores, and
expect everything to &quot;just work&quot; (existing turn signals signal, and
semaphores semaphore)?

Thanks.
