&lt;&lt; Hello all,
 does anyone have the dimensions for the outer and/or inner lower
 bearing(s) on the small nut redux boxes?
 the lower outer bearing is part # 311 501 283.  There is a bearing shop
 here in town and I'd like to see if I can get the bearing locally before
 ordering one...  I'm trying to get this thing back on the road ASAP.  I
 was talking to a VW shop here...and the guy thinks that the outer is a
 standard bearing that I should be able to get from a bearing
 shop....does anyone have these bearings laying around they could get the
 numbers off of? &gt;&gt;

the 2 inner ones are bearing # 6306, the lower outer one is also 6306, and 
the upper outer one is 6305.  That is bearing people part number.  The 
bearing shop should understand what you mean when you say you need 3 &quot;6306&quot;s 
and one &quot;6305&quot;
