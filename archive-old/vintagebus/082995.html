Subject: Re: [VB] Stock muffler on a 1776?

I have a similar amount of Dynamat Extreme inside the bus on the floor,
walls, doors and roof. I also have 2 layers of the JC Whitney Heat shield
batting on the walls and roof. The floor has 1 layer and a layer of 1/10&quot;
thick dead rubber. I also lined the roof of the engine compartment with the
JCW Heat shield stuff.  Wish I could say that I can't hear the engine. it is
still quite loud.

Given the subject line of your post, do you have a stock VW muffler on your
engine? or is it a header and quiet pack muffler?

Chris


&gt; Got my header from Ronnie, don't know what it is, but it works great. Key
is
&gt; in insulating your bus. Just finished insulating the panel and took it on
a
&gt; drive around town. Worst part was I couldn't hear the engine at all. Had
to
&gt; look at idiot lights at stops to see if engine had quit or not. Really
weird
&gt; not hearing engine. I installed 200 sq. ft. of BQuite ( used to call it
Brown
&gt; Bread) rubber/alum sound dampener and 2 complete layers of the
&gt; alum/plastic/alum bubble insulation. Covered roof, sides, floors,
doors,front
&gt; nose, rear hatch. No paneling installed for now, will do that after VTO
&gt; weekend campout. BQuite is costly, but well worth it I think, goes on real
&gt; easy also.
