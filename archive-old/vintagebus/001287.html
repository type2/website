Subject: Josh's web page - trip documentation

I was reading Josh's page and his documentary on his trips to the dunes.  It
appears he had planned to attend a campout in January of 1999.  Anyhow, I
was saddened when I read the last entry:

November 22, 1998

We ended up getting home approximately 8am. I rested up for T-day. Later
inspection of my tranny showed a crack all the way across the top of the
tranny from axle to axle. Darn. This will likely be the last trip of 1998
for me.

Til next time......
