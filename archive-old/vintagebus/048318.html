Subject: NOS Fram Oil filter canister
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

Ok guys----
I was checking out Lenny's site www.classicvws_dot_com and noticed in the flat 4 
section that he had NOS fram oil filter canisters for sale (the ones that you 
see on those vintage 36/40 hp supercharged engines frequently).  They are 
almost $200, but, can they be adapted for use on a 1600 dp?  Would there be 
any advantages other than looks. How could you adapt them (I don't know where 
they hook up in the first place?)? 

I'm just curious as that would give a &quot;modern&quot; engine a nice vintage look to 
it:)

I prob just have too much free time:)
