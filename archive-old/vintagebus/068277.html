Subject: Re: [VB] For the record: &quot;new&quot; king pin tolerance makes it 
  difficult to  grease

Ok. I did some looking, and yes, there is a factory
spec of .15mm/.006 specified, but for the up/down
freeplay of the spacer and lower kingpin in the
steering knuckle, NOT for the kingpin and bushing
clearance. I don't think this up/down freeplay would
really effect how hard it will be to grease the
kingpin though.
So I guess I was just confused by what Bus Boys had
said/meant. Regardless, it will be hard to grease the
kingpins when new. Just do it alot, like every few
days until you are satisfied you have enough grease or
you see it come out of the seal area. Then do it some
more! (As Homer Simpson would say--- uuuhhhmmmmmm
greeeeeeaaase! [drool])

&gt; I sure would like to see where that specification is
&gt; printed. PLEASE show me in a factory book! I know
&gt; that
&gt; is VALVE clearance. I would highly DOUBT that is any
&gt; kind of specified kingpin clearance other than a
&gt; smooth, nonbinding, no play fit in the bushing. If
&gt; they had that much clearance from NEW (rebuilt),
&gt; what
&gt; would be the point? There would already be way too
&gt; much freplay.

&gt; Hi,
&gt; 
&gt; So, after getting off the phone with Walt at Bus
&gt; Boys, apparently when 
&gt; the King Pin and Bushing clearance is per factory
&gt; specification .006&quot; 
&gt; (0.15 mm)
