&gt;&gt;Pretty close guess off the top of my head, though.

Oh yeah.  I didn't mean to correct you or provide an &quot;absolute 100% true&quot;
number, just some more information.

&gt;Hm, note said how they retrofit the later gears in the earlier buses if
&gt;new parts are needed.   earlier parts I assume were NLA, and they say
&gt;it's okay to have one kind on one side and the other on the other!!!!

I would think that would tend to work the differential a little harder,
but I guess they thought it was OK.  They were probably balancing that
against the extra labor and parts costs involved with opening up the
other RGB.  I get the impression that RGB gears don't crap out that
often, and I wonder how many &quot;mis-matched&quot; Buses actually resulted from
that policy.

&gt;Still curious as to why Doliwa has slightly different numbers.  What I'd
&gt;like to find out is how accurate these numbers are, and how often they
&gt;are inacurate and in what way.

I've noticed that it varies.  There are some numbers that are the same
between all VW-published and aftermarket sources, and then there are
some that vary a little.  Sometimes I wonder if some of the numbers in
non-VW-published sources have been altered as copyright traps.  Or maybe
some records aren't very detailed and people are interpolating the numbers.

&gt;Okay, whose got a bus with VIN between 469 447 and 469 506?

The closest Buses listed in the Registry at vintagebus_dot_com are 468 957
(McArthurs, AL) and 469 869 (Dave Mayes, OR).
