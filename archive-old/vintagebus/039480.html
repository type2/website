&gt;Today I find that while the digital
&gt;meter says I idle at about 850rpm, the VDO says 1200. I have been
&gt;concerned about over-revving my engine, since the VDO says maybe
&gt;4500+rpms at 60mph. But now I don't think so much of the accuracy of
&gt;the VDO and would like to ditch it. Never could figure out a good
&gt;place to put it either. But maybe it is the little digimeter thing
&gt;that's the problem?

Ok so you have a vdo tach. They are adjustable. And they can be set for 6 
cylinders. Make sure yours isnt. There is a little dip switch to make the 
change. Then using the little screw adjust it.

OR:
send it to me!

My bus ran like crap the last time I drove it, and I mean crap. I too am 
frustrated and havent tried to fix the problem.
