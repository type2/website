Subject: Can the BN4 Heater be where the battery is on the right side?

Splitty Drivers,

  I was wondering if I could put a BN4 heater where the battery is on the
right side?  I have a spare tire well on the left side and that stops from
using that side.  I'd also have to move the bracket for the air cleaner
and see if the ducting would fit through the bulkhead below the gas tank
spout.  Probably would be better to just put it under the fold out seat.
I've seen them inside single cabs under the front seat.

Best,
joe
