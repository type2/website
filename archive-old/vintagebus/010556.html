&lt;&lt; How do I tell if the front beam on my '63 is original or has been replaced
 with the newer version? What's the difference? &gt;&gt;
Hi Andre,
You can tell by the front beam ID number stamped on it or wether it has the 
earlier grease cap over the outer drum bearing that fits inside of the drum.  
The later grease cap fits over this opening in the drum, and has a nice ridge 
around it's outer dia which allows one to use a claw hammer to remove the 
cap.   Eric&amp;Barb
