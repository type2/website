Subject: Heater box confusion
Message-ID: &lt;Pine.LNX.4.10.10010082138030.5659-100000_at_birdbird&gt;

Hello all!

With the brakes nearly done, I was looking today at the new and old
heater boxes I have for my '64 Standard.  The right new one is Dansk
and the left new one is VW.  Both old ones appear to be aftermarket;
no internal ribs on the exhaust pipe and no &quot;VW&quot; stamp.

On the right old one, the long lever that has the cable connection
at one end and the short lever for the flap at the other end is
retained in the center by an E-clip in a groove on the pivot shaft.
The new one has the pivot shaft, but no groove in the end.  Do I
file a groove into it, or is there some other way that this lever
is retained?

Also, on the right old one, there is a torsion spring around the
center pivot.  One end bears on the lever and the other end goes
into a small hole in the heater box casing.  The new one doesn't
have a hole...is there any reason why I shouldn't just carefully
drill one?

On the left side it gets more interesting.  The small lever for
the flap comes out on the wrong side.  Also, there is no pivot
shaft for the middle of the big lever.  There's a flat spot for
it, but no shaft.  Can I flip the small lever/flap axle around
if I take apart the control box?  Is there a standard part/kit
for putting the pivot shaft on a non-pivot-shaft box?

If it makes a difference, the engine is a 1500 out of a '68 Bug
(by engine number).

Thanks very much!!
