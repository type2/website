Thanks for the parts list people.
 I seem to be able to get everything except the thermostatic flaps. Now,
some say leaving them out is a small sin similar to removing the thermostat
from a water cooled motor and that the only thing to concern myself with is
the slightly longer warmup period. I dont know. Can I have some advice
please?
