NO, that is not a sport.



When was the &quot;hump&quot; backrest used?



I have a hump seat in my '59 single and (2) of my '61 Westies.



When were they used, only on certain models?

good question.  my 61 non sunroof deluxe has the hump on the back part of the
front seat (and original seat upholstery). 
  I didn't think they were used in 59, but ???  

survey says?
