Hold on there partner!!  Beauty is only skin deep.  The best part of owning a 
bus is DRIVING it.  It doesn't have to be a beauty to do that.  Did you have 
fun riding in my Binz?  It's fun, it's comfortable, it's safe, but it ain't 
any beauty queen.  Hell I only wash it twice a year for fear all the paint 
will come off.  Wax?  What's wax?

Take it from me, I've had the restored bus (21 window) and done the show 
thing.  I get a *lot* bigger kick out of driving them than I ever did 
baby-sitting them at a show.  Save the 100 point resto busses for the fat 
wallet guys, drive yours and enjoy it!!

just my .02

&lt;&lt; It's kind of dumb to be thinking about selling off this bus as I've worked
 really darn hard to put it on the road but it really irks me to look at it.
