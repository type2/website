Probably, he was hit by external forces in all cases.  No matter what car he
was driving, the accidents would have occurred if he had been in the same
place at the same time?

Tom Buese- whose  wife  has been in 2 totals, several other smaller
accidents, all the faults of others, claims she is unlucky while I who
hasn't been in an accident since I was 16 (38 yrs ago) is an aggressive
driver, but lucky! WTF
