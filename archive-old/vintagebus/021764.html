How is the air cooling/heating system made up in a bus? Where are the vents or
the buttons to control the air? Where does the heat come from? How come my dad
says that they are hard to heat in the winter?

How is the engine kept cool? Are their vents on the outside? Or what?

Does the small engine of the bus have any drawbacks? My friends at school say
that 51 HP wouldn't even budge it! What other size engines are their for the
bus? Whats the top speed of the bus on a flat surface.....or goin up a hill?

generally you find vws withe fresh air heating- the fan housing has a tube on
each side leading down through the muffler into the heater boxes, and the fan
blows through the heater boxes picks up heat (mean while cooling the exhaust)
and sends it up to the cab/interior of bus (or other vw)

The problems peopl often have is 

1)  the heating system is often not properly hooked up.  The tubes from the
heater boxes to body may be missing or loose, or the heater cable broken, or
people dont know how to turn the heat on.

2) the bus does not seal well- doors are drafty dur to old/missing seals,
possible dents causing gaps, and possible rust holes to ventilate the
interior.  They did seal well when new, but these are 30+ years old now.   

3) lack of insulation/missing paneling  Bare metal above your head transmits
the cold inside very well.

I have found that is you get the heat hooked up well, you get a good flow into
the car.   Then you need to plug the drafts.    Insulation helps- like that
shiny spae age bubble wrap stuff.     The stock heat is great, if you keep it
inside.   If it is actually below freezing outside, it will not be that toasty
inside though.


Also, takes a bit to heat up, as the motor needs to heat up first.   So the
first 5-10 minutes aren't so hot.


Lots on this in archives.
