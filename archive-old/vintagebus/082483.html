Subject: Freight Companies - South Dakota to Arizona

I have a middle seat and some other large bus Items as well as a Vespa that 
I need shipped from SD to AZ.

Does anyone have any information on some good freight companies that can 
provide me with a decent price?  Some reccomendations?

I have never dealt with any of these companies before and have no idea if 
they are ripping me off or not.

Thanks.


It would be shipped from Sioux Falls, South Dakota to Phoenix, Arizona.

Dan Howard
