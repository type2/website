We are planning a trip to Newfoundland this summer, probably a month or so,
in our '65 Westy. I am kind of thinking of pulling the original engine and
putting in a fresh, brand new one. What is the difference between the new
engines places like Scat sells, and the Bettlemex engine? The price is
about the same it seems. Are they both new Mexican built?  thanks, Jim

is there something wrong with the engine you have?    If not I wouldn't
bother.   Do a tune up, check the compression and end play.     Carry spare
parts and tools and a first aid kit.      Make sure your brake are good-adjust
and flush and bleed them, change the tranny oil, grease the front suspension.
Have good wiper blades.   are your electrics good?   Horn working?  Lights all
working?  Clean your connections and grounds for brightness, maybe get some
halogen headlamps if your feel like it (I have them in my 65 westy- nice on
dark country roads).   How old are your brake hoses / fuel line / tranny
boots- are they good?

   Pack candles and a deck of cards and some wine. 

If your engine is on it's last legs a rebuild is a good idea.
