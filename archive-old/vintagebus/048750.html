Subject: '59 Kombi wiper motor substitute...

The wiper motor in my bus seems to not work anymore. I've got some 
more around here I can put in it's place. My bus is doing the 12 volt 
thing though. I'm aware of all the voltage drops and such I can do. 
But I'm curious.

Looking at the moter, it doesn't seem to be anything all that 
special. It seems like, with some minor mods, that some kind of 
generic 12-volt replacement could be put in it's place. I mean, the 
motor just turns round in one direction. Anyone ever used something 
else in place of the stock wiper motor for an earlier split? The 
later split busses have a wiper motor/shaft all-in-one type set-up 
that the earlier busses don't. So...I may put a 6 volter in there 
temporarily and do some looking. If anyone has any experience or 
ideas, pass them along. I know a lot of folks have switched to 12 
volt and a more common/affordable off the shelf electric 12 volt 
motor would be nice.
