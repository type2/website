Patrick gave some URLs of rooftop lodgings (my comments 
inserted):

&gt; http://www.cooltent_dot_com/steelstrip1.htm
 -- this is a modern version of the Dove tent (I heard the comapny 
went under?)
&gt; http://www.theusualplace_dot_com/redbug/
 -- several knockoffs like this of the old Devon canopy exist
&gt; http://members.aol_dot_com/HGsTopBunk/
 -- nice variation on the Dove approach, but a &quot;new way to camp&quot;?
&gt; http://www.bimo_dot_com/skydome1.htm
 -- another variation on the Dove idea.
&gt; http://www.loftyshelters_dot_com/
 -- ah!  Now *these* are cool....

but left out my favorite: http://www.supernet_dot_net/~jclark/vw/ , which 
has links to several of the above and will soon incorporate the 
others if they're deemed worthy by our High Paid Editorial Board.

And John Howard said re the rooftop tent:

&gt;  Rich Yost has an original one ( with new canvas) in green and white.
&gt;  ... I have a few pictures of it from the trip.
[snip]
&gt; I have a couple original VW dealer post cards
&gt; that show this setup on a camper in the showroom in red and white.

John, is this the VWoA tent pictured on my site?  I'd be grateful for 
more pics/info to include.

Sayeth Douglas:

&gt; I'm working on having a Westy tent reproduced by Dawn at PLF. If she

Sounds cool!  Which model?
