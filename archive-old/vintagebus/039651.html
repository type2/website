Sorry to bring up a sore subject again so soon. Reading the GGC newsletter 
it also says that they &quot;would hold to the 25 years or older vintage 
definition and see if it makes a difference&quot;. The newsletter also states &quot; 
basically the classes for next year's show will be 1967 and earlier and 
1968-1976&quot;. These years include the lagwagons and even some rabbits. These 
rules sound fair (remember it is billed as a vintage meet) and will help to 
keep another early car in and a NB out. I promise to keep my '63 DC in the 
parking lot if it makes room for even 1 more nice BD,split,oval,heb or 
even(gulp) baywindow.
