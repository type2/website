Subject: Re: [VB] Fuel Filter question, re-usable

&gt;From: John Baker&lt;jbakerccymca_at_springmail_dot_com&gt;

&gt;
&gt;While picking up brakes for my 71 Westy, I saw and bought a re-usable 
&gt;fuel filter made by BugPack.  It's the glass kind with the replaceable
&gt;screen inside.

My Grandma's '74 Bug had one of these on it; it seemed to work OK but
the glass cracked right after we got it.  I have seen a very similar
filter for sale at Pep Boys - there are different housings for different
size fuel hoses but the elements are the same.  Pep Boys also sells
three-packs of elements for them.  I think it's sold under the
Purolator brand there.
