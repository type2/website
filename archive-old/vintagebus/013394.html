&gt;&gt; These new GPS...


Well, not all that new, but the prices have come down to the point
where they are becoming very practical for a lot of folks.
My wife (bless her heart) gifted me with a Garmin GPSIII+ for Father's
day.  It has all the features Mike described and one other that makes
it wonderful for bus folk:  Downloadable detail maps.  Yep, you can
have a moving map display in your bus that will make a Lexus owner
envious!

Before I drove from my home near LA to my father's house in Northern
Nevada, I downloaded the detail maps for the entire trip from a CDROM
to the GPS.  As we drove along, the GPS provided a continuous moving
map display showing all intersecting roads, streets, rivers, streams,
lakes, etc.
 
The detail is impressive, as many of the roads in the database proved
to be 2-track dirt trails!  When we entered a town, the display showed
street-level detail including street names.

For hiker-types, there is also a CDROM available with topographic data
(having a direct GPS route back to camp doesn't help you if there's a
mountain in the way!)

In addition, once you tell the GPS where you are going, then it will
tell you the remaining distance and the time it expects you to be
there based upon your current speed and direction.

Of course, the GPS has basic functions of showing where you are, which
direction you are moving, and how fast you are moving.  The last data
is a bit disappointing with my aging bus speedometer!

As Mike has pointed out, it isn't a good idea to rely on GPS as your
sole navigation system.  The batteries can give out, the satellites
can be masked by overhead obstructions or deep canyons, and the GPS
signals themselves are distorted by the DOD so that position data can
vary by 100m or more.  I haven't thrown the maps out of the bus yet!
