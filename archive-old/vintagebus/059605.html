Subject: Re: [VB] REV LIMITER?

&gt;
&gt;&lt;&lt; Were there any of these made to fit a DP motor with a 34pict 3 on it?


oh yeah, i would say no, as it was a splitty-era option AFAIK, BUT
industrial engines mighta had it later in life. these seem to have a more
'modern' rev-limiting dizzy rotor, tho.


i think on a motor using a later carb - and ESPECIALLY DPs -  you will find
the throat opening in the governor to be smaller than the throat of your
carb, reducing the efficiency/drivability of that carb.  not a good idea.
