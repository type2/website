&lt;&lt; How about using one long belt like on newer cars.&gt;&gt;
Hi Greg,
Not sure if that will work well since that means less contact between each of 
the generator pulley and the belt.

&lt;&lt; Or how about a lower pulley from a Judson setup?? &gt;&gt;
Probably would work.  We need one for our 40HP Judson kit anyway!  We were 
just hoping at the least to find out the correct size to get it right the 
first time.
