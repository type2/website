Subject: tool dipping clamps aint all that...
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

I also suggest going to the hardware store and
purchasing a length of 40mm shower pan liner material.
OEM application of that item is for a barrier between
concrete and tile in an old tile shower. Try Home
Depot. Is cheap.
Cut to fit between shiny new paint and clamp.
Sharp edges/corners of clamps with chafe through tool
dip in about the time that it takes to say &quot;Damn, I
shoulda got that chit that Ellis was talking about!&quot;

Been there and done that with the 67 Westy resto. My
rack is a PIP repop Westy rack. Clamps on real Westy
rack and PIP have sharp/sharp-ish corners. Makes no
sense to spend years and dollars getting your ride
nice and then cheaping out at the last minute. Tubing
on older style rack feet is also recommended.

My opinion is that tool dipping looks nasty and
doesn't work well. 40mm pan liner comes by the linear
foot and is usually five feet &quot;wide&quot;. Usually medium
gray.
