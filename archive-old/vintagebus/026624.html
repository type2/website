Well,

Just got back from seeing the bus in person and chatting with Lenny and his
assistant.  Both were very nice and opened up the shop on a rare rainy So Cal
day just so I could take a peek.  They are very nice.

First it is a 54 and in the limited inspection of it (no lying on my back) it is
a truly remarkable restoration.
Most everything is correct and in unbelievable condition.  This is by far the
nicest BD deluxe I have seen.  .  Lenny said that Charlie came over yesterday
and said the same thing.  Lenny said he was a consultant on this resto as Lenny
didn't know BD's as well as Charlie.

Lenny said the bus came from Southern CA, but had spent time early in its life
back East where it acquired mucho rust, but not as much as yours Thom (Lenny
said).  Lenny said that all panels with the exception on the right rear corner
came from donor busses.  No repop metal....if that matters.  The R corner is
completely fab'd including the dent for the reflector.  Extremely nice job.

They estimate about 30-35 K for the resto.  The paint is VERY NICE!  About the
only flaw I could find in the admittedly dim warehouse light was a small drip
hanging off of the right rear bumper end.  Very minor.  The paint is a Glassurit
single stage acrylic urethane.  The bus has been painted about 3 times and color
sanded in between.  Not sure why, but the paint looks very thick and glossy.


There are a few details that they have yet to complete.  During the resto
process the right reflector was lost (ouch).  They are looking for another.  The
motor that is in it is not the correct &quot;20&quot; motor.  It has a very nicely
restored '56 36hp in it right now.  About the only other thing I saw in my brief
visit was that the strap that holds the spare tire down over the engine was not
correct.  Currently it is your garden variety plastic buckle with nylon strap.
They are searching for a correct strap and buckle. The only minor flaw I saw on
the inside, was that the rear jail bars around the windows were noticeably
scrached...not bad though.  The car is wedged in between many other VW's, so I
couldn't open any doors...not sure if the front mat was there, but the interior
is amazing!

Again, I only spent about 1/2 an hour chatting and glancing politely at the
bus...I did not white glove it.  It is scheduled for the July HVW's vintage
issue....possibly on the cover.   This is truly a remarkable bus.  I forgot to
ask where the owner lives, or who it is.

Oh yea...the plate thing.  They said that the BD lid should not have had holes
from the factory (not sure if that is from Charlie) so that is how they resto'd
it.

Again if you get a chance to see this one do it it is an amazing and beautiful
bus.

Steve

&gt; &gt;Good question, I think they were drilled when the plates were installed.  My
&gt; &gt;'55 has been drilled twice, once for the larger '55 CA yellow plates
&gt; &gt;(original CA-sold Bus) and once for the smaller later plates.
&gt;
&gt; My '55 was exactly the same way.  I bet they were drilled locally, as I
&gt; think european plates have different spacing depending on the locality.
&gt; Also, mine were not drilled in the most professional manner...
