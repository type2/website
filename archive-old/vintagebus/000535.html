Hi Thom,
If the canvas is in good condition (Not mildewed and/or thin from wear.) and 
the whole set up is there (Tilt, bows and wood slats.) it is a fair price.  
Just the aluminum grommets in the tilt canvas new will cost you about $200.00 
to replace!  Then replacement canvas will set you back another $75.00.  The 
more important question is what year is this tilt for?  The post-1967 SC 
tilts are little under two inches longer.   Eric&amp;Barb
