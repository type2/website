Hi Mike

Looks like you're having some real fun with your new carbs 8^). I think
Kyle is on the right track. I just went through the same sort of thing
with my wife's car (some asian made thing) and it all boiled down to the
mixture being too lean. In that case it was due to multiple air leaks,
none of which was all that bad, but they added up.

Here's a little info that might help you trouble shoot. I don't know
what size venturis I have. The carbs came (used like yours) with 130
main jets and 160 air correction. I am now running 140 mains and 170
air, but as we all know (thanks again David) I'm sucking air out of my
crankcase and into my balance tube. I expect the original jets to be
about right when I get that fixed. This is all on a stock displ, stock
cam, bugpack extractor w/single muffler, 009 dist, CW crank, engine. The
009 works well with these carbs in my experience, absolutely no
hesitation. Just to offer a little encouragement - Every time I drive my
bus I can hardly believe how much smoother and more powerful it is than
my DC which has an identicle engine with the exception of the carbs. The
truck still has a 34 PICT 3.

On the bushings - I just did that job and used DU bushings made by
Garlock Bearings. You can get them from industrial supply places like
Motion Industries, for example. They're a really good choice for this
application as they don't require lubrication (they have a layer of lead
in them) and they can take up to 536 deg. F temps. Oil impregnated
bronze (Oilite) is only good to about 250 F. They are also available in
metric sizes. Get them installed by somebody who will pay attention when
you say &quot;Do not ream these bushings&quot;. They are ruined by reaming, it
removes the lead. I have used them for years in my work (Mechanical
Engineering) and have found them to be very durable.

I hope that helps. See Kyle, I wasn't holding out, I just don't get a
chance to play on the net until I really should be in bed 8^)
