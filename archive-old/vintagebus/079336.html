Subject: Re: [VB] new panel, loud rgbs.

Hi Ronniechase,
We would run it.  If the RGBs do not quiet down after a thousand miles or so, 
we would take them apart and inspect the insides.  If then you find nothing 
wrong you might need to replace the axle and/or fulcrum plates, or even the 
tranny center section needs a rebuild.  If things do quiet down we would change 
the tranny gear oil again after a thousand miles, and as always inspect the 
gear oil drained.
  Tach you bus for a fifteen minute drive with a copilot to see at what MPH 
1,500 &amp; 3,000 RPMs are in each forward gear!
  Make sure to carry a full set of bearings, seals, gaskets, and tools do one 
side of your bus suspension if you are going to go on long trips.  BTDT twice!
