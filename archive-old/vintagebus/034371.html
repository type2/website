mmmm,

perhaps not so.  the adjustment screw 'tightens'
the shaft's radial play (i.e. makes the shaft 'harder' to rotate radially)
but it also presses the pin into the worm AND is the
end adjustment for the shaft - i.e. stops it from slopping
around in the left to right direction.

To test, undo the adjustment screw (and nut) and back it
off or take it out - check out the end play you get in the shaft.
A really badly adjusted acrew will result in lots of end play
and left to right movement?

&gt; &lt;&lt; Thanks for your reply, The play is right, left like driver side and 
&gt; passager side.  I have read a  little about adjustment for the box but not
&gt; 
&gt; much, is this needed? is it 
&gt;  easy? &gt;&gt;
&gt; Hi Steve,
&gt; Your steering box sound dangerous, and needs either to be rebuilt or 
&gt; replaced.  Adjusting is easy, but will only take play out of the radial 
&gt; movement.    Eric&amp;Barb
