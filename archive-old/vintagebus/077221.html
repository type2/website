&gt; The spring and the lever in front of the fan housing holds the flaps

I talked w/ Mark one time about this. What he has seen has been the
occasional bellows that fail. then instead of just letting go and
opening up the flaps (as 99 out of 100 do) the t'stat gets wedged in
such a way to not allow the flap rod to actually move. It wants to,
but because of a bind can't.
