I got doglegs cut for a '65 for $75/side from vintagewarehouse 3 months ago
(www.vintagewarehouse_dot_com).  Had to rebuild them a little, but the cost was
supposed to be mostly labor.  Also got a quote from Averre's in Washington for
$150/side.  Also mostly labor.  Didn't go with them.

Seems completely arbitrary, ask and ye may receive.

&gt; WE HAVE THE DOGLEGS FOR $200.00 A SIDE REAR CORNERS FOR $200.00 A SIDE AND A
&gt; THE WHOLE FRONT NOSE CLIP FOR $500.00.  TAKE IN MIND THAT WE HAVE TO CUT THE
&gt; BUS APART.  A LOT OF LABOR.
&gt;
&gt; So that's
&gt;
&gt; (200 x 2) + (200 x 2) + 500 = 1300 for some parts?  I betcha Kelly could
&gt; fabricate the pieces for less than that.  Granted it's not og, but that's an
&gt; awful lot for what?  Barndoor parts?  Are we gonna seen the '54 RHD Deluxe
&gt; driving around the streets of Sacramento in about a week?
