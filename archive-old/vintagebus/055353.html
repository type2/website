&gt; Hello,
&gt; We are putting this event on again this year. Last year was the first year
&gt; and it
&gt; was a big success. It will be held on Nov. 2-4th in Millsboro,Delaware.
&gt; It will be held at Holly Lakes Campgrounds.
&gt; http://www.hollylakescampsites_dot_com/
&gt; There is no need to make reservations,
&gt; just tell them you are with the Vw group upon arrival.
&gt;  They have assured me that they have plenty of room for us. Arrive early
on
&gt; Friday and get a good spot and enjoy some great company.
&gt; The plan is to caravan Saturday to Punkin Chunkin about 10:00 am.
&gt; www.punkinchunkin_dot_com It was a blast last year
&gt; . Sat. night we will have a potluck dinner for anyone interested.
&gt; Here are some pics fromlast year

&gt; You can e-mail me if you have any question or just want to let me know you
&gt; are coming.
&gt; Keep your eyes open a website is coming soon.
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; Dave Parsons
