Subject: JBB a success

Hi Folks,
The first ever John Brown's Buses in Harpers Ferry, WV  was a 
success.  Total of 11 buses showed up.  It was a relaxing weekend with the 
company of great folks.  The weather cooperated fro most of the weekend.  I 
swear the leaves change colors as the weekend passed.  Thanks to all that 
came especially the folks that travelled a distance; The Pott's who came 
down from Canada and Paul A. from New York.  It looks like there will be a 
JBB II next year.  Greg Potts took lots of pictures, so after he 
recuperates over the next couple days, I have him send them to me and I'll 
post them.  See you next year!

Joy Thru Air,
Jamie Auch
