Subject: RE: [VB] Body work tool -- shrinking

Where can I go to read about metal shrinking?  I will need to be doing some
soon.

Could someone describe how it is done with the stud gun?

Thanks,

Elliot

OK this is my opinion, i like the stud puller and have used one, but i use a
regular slide hammer dent puller which the end screws on and is tapped for a
1/4 thread. I take 1/4 bolts and weld them to plate of 14 ga. steel the
width i need, i tack that to the body and use it to pull by, works just as
good as a stud gun and you have a better selection of tips ready at hand or
at your local hardware. Another point as well the 1/4 bolt will take more
abuse than the studs will. I like the shrinking tip though alot that thing
is fat. Later when funds are better i will get a stud gun setup but at this
time i have tools i need worse..later
