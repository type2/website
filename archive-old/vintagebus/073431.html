&gt; i'm still not sure about the pressure tho. at start, i get 90 PSI, and it 
&gt; usually stays that way for a while at speed (3600 rpm); it will eventually 
&gt; drop to 75 or so. 

Hi Craig,
Yes that is way too high of pressure.  Either the rear oil pressure relief 
spring is too stiff, stuck relief piston or the oil pump is creating too much 
pressure.  The latter will cause a properly working rear oil pressure relief to 
be pushed down all the time and this in turn would not valve all the oil to go 
through the cooler when you need it cooled.  Hmmm, this could also be caused 
by an oil passage that is too small/blocked....
