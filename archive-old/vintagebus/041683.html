&gt;  the 61 wearing 15&quot; rims with 26&quot; dia tires (all 4 same)
&gt;  tranny big nut (1.26 redux) with what when I took the side cover off was a 
&gt; 4.37 r&amp;p


Assuming stock 4th gears, (.82)
using
mph = (rpm * cir) / (gear * final * 88)  the 65's tire circumference=6.68,
the 61's=6.81

at 3500 in 4th,

the 65 should be doing 66.27mph (1.26, 3.88)
the 61 shoudl be doing 59.99mph (1.26, 4.37)

at 3000 in 4th

65: 56.81
61: 51.42

&gt;  am told the speedo in my 61 is a little slow- that 58 on the speedo is 62 
&gt; real speed
&gt;  
&gt;  not sure how exact the 65's is, but not wildly off.

Looks like the 61 is a good bit slow, of course, more at higher speeds,
less at lower.  A veryunstandable amount, but still off.


The 65 looks to be pretty accurate.

I think VW purposely has their speedo's way off. I just replaced the
speedo in my Quantum...the old was was anywhere from 5 to 40mph off (~90
real mph was well over 120 on the speedo, milage accurate) the new one is
8 slow at 70 (70mph=78mph real speed...as per a radar gun).  this is the
.third. unit in this car, as the original was off as well..all with
accurate milage)

now you know, eh?:)

later....david
