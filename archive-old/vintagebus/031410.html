Subject: Re: [VB] Emblem Clips?

Go to your favorite local body shop...or any body shop for that matter. 
  Tell them what you have and what you need and they should be able to 
set you up.  Thats what I did...

What you need is 4 little nipple sort of rubber things that go over the 
emblem posts.  Put those on the emblem, then push it into the holes on 
the body.  I did that for my 71 (my 62 still has the OG emblem on it :) 
and the guy charged me a buck for all 4, or 3, I forget what the early 
bays take...

Anyways, I think thats the best way to do it...

&gt; 
&gt; I have a new emblem for my 55', actually the only emblem I have every had
&gt; for it, and need to know how to make it stay on.  From what I understand
&gt; there are clips for the back, however I have never seen any and am wondering
&gt; what to us.  Is this something that you can purchase from Bus Boys, or
&gt; Ronnie?  Or, can I just get them from a hardware store?  Thanks in advance.
