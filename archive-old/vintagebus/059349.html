 Something is wrong.  If you're not running any lights or anything -
 just the coil - the voltage at the battery shouldn't drop off that
 fast, especially since you push started it.  Muir claimed that you
 could run &quot;most all day&quot; with a good battery and a bad generator,
 which means the voltage shouldn't fall off that fast.

this is true- my gen light came on near Cheyenne Wy, and the bus didn't die 
till 6 miles from Tonopah Nev, when I put the headlights on.

but ya- check groundsand power to/from batt, and does the gen light come on 
on the dash?   how many volts coming out of the gen?
