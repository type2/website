Subject: Well, let's see...

Been lurking in the shadows for a while, moving to a new hiding hole,
catching the digest as I could.

With 7000 miles on my transaxel, I developed a grinding in the center
section.  I was not pleased, to say the least.  I had just bought this
tranny from Rancho.  I called them at 4000 miles to tell them there was
a noise, but the guy that answered convinced me there was nothing in the
tranny that could make a grinding noise.  (Yeah, I know.)  I was
thinking when it was just too loud to stay in it at 7000 it was going to
be a hassel to get fixed.

Spoke with Sam _at_ Rancho.  What a guy!  He's going to honor his
warranty.  Imagine that, a vendor who stands behind his work.

This weekend looks like pulling a transaxel, but at least I'm not
cussing while I'm doing it.

We'll see how the warranty stuff goes.
