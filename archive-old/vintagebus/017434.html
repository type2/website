Hello,
I see that JC Whitney sells the type 2 Bentley manual
for under $60, and I suspect that it is available
elsewhere in that price range too.  Still not cheap,
but it is the best book available.  So, if you aren't
overwhelmed by offers of used ones, shop around and
get a new one--it's worth it.
