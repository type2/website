&lt;&lt; is there some trick to getting the nuts off of the #3 and #1 exhaust
 studs?  I want to change my heater boxes...I've been soaking the nuts in
 penetrating oil and have gotten 2 off so far.  The bottom ones.  Now for
 the top ones.... is there a special tool? sheer brute force?&gt;&gt;
Hi Isaiah,
Only if you want to soon afterward have to drill out what is left of the 
studs out of the heads and install new studs!

&lt;&lt;or should I yoink the motor and replace my clutch while the derned thing is 
out...&gt;&gt;
That would probably be wise, or at least check everything in there!  Either 
way it is best to take a chisel and use it on the stuck nuts with the blade 
parallel to the stud.  What you really are trying to do is to slightly spread 
the side of the nut, and jar the rust loose at the same time.  After getting 
off the offending nuts it would be wise to replace them with Nipponese 
automotive brass exhaust nuts that do not suffer the problems of rusting on 
so much as the steel ones!   Eric&amp;Barb
