From Unca Joel on the Vanagon list...

for those of you who still remember the old aircooled 1950-1967 buses
fondly, here's a site to give you something to do for yourself when
you've nothing to do during the holidays. :)

http://hannoverwerks_dot_com/VW_paper_models/

yup. it's a paper model of an old transporter. :) now the trick is,
from what i can tell, you need ALL of the .jpg files downloaded to
your pc, and then print them out (preferably on somewhat thick paper).
color printer would be nicer. then cut and paste, literally. :)   i
haven't found any instructions, so you're kinda on your own. took me a
while to figure out that the 01.jpg file is just the frame and part of
the engine!!! it's a very extensive and complicated model ... even has
oil drums and a big crate to put inside as cargo! :)

and you could print a set for each kiddie on your xmas list and REALLY
disappoint them! :)

unca $crooge. ;)
