&gt; Does anyone have any good tips for shipping front window glass??  What
type of box, container, padding, carrier??
&gt;
I received a set of windshields a couple months ago, the guy had packed
them with cardboard in between the glass, then wrapped that in saran wrap
so it was tight, then surrounded that with sheets of thin styrofoam.  It
was sent UPS with a decklid in the same box.  No damage occured.
