&gt; I'm gonna end up tinting my windows here pretty soon. I'll be doing it
&gt; myself. My questions have to do with the laws, specifically here in
Texas.
&gt;
&gt; The current law is applicable for cars '87 and newer, or any tinting
done
&gt; to a vehicle after that time. It only allows for 35% on the
&gt; driver/passenger front windows.
&gt;
&gt; I'm wondering about a vehicle that was tinted before that. It would
have to
&gt; be &quot;Grandfathered&quot; I assume and wouldn't be subject to the current
&gt; restrictions.

I'm just a Californian, but I'm willing to bet that the previous
regulations were &quot;no tint at all on driver or passenger windows.&quot;

I know that the tint appliers have been lobbying lately to allow tint
on driver and passenger windows on the theory that they will help to
prevent skin cancer.  Personally, I'm more worried about crashing into
other cars at night than I am about cancer!

If you really want to cool your bus off, put a full-length roof rack
on and then attach a sheet of 1/4 inch plywood to the rack.  This will
shade the roof and make the bus a _lot_ cooler.  I have tint aft of
the driver/passenger and the shade made a lot more difference in the
temperature then the tint.

Tint is really easy to apply to buses, as all the windows are nice and
flat.  It can be done yourself if you make sure that the windows are
CLEAN CLEAN CLEAN and use only distilled water to apply the film.  If
you use tap water the film will be bubbled within a few months from
bacterial growth.  I use distilled water, alcohol, and ammonia to
clean the windows and then rinse them really good with the distilled
water.
