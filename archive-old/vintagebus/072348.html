 i'd like to hear more opinions on this topic.  jon and i recently re-did 
nearly the entire brake system on my girly ghia with new stuff.  one of the drums 
replaced was an original.  the drum was judged thin and scored; well used 
beyond continued service  &gt;&gt;
I think the  idea is only turn them is they really need it- scored and stuff. 
 The ridge that forms at the side of the drum toward the center of the bus 
where the shoes don't actually hit the drum, I wouln't turn the drum for that.   
 I ground down the ridge with an angle grinder.    Or just undo the shoe 
adjustment more and ignore it.
