Subject: Hippi[e-bashing]...

Thom, et.al.....

   Before you start in criticising a particular genre of people, please
remember that they are probably on the List. It doesn't matter.... we've
got teachers, students, hippies, deadheads, phishheads, &quot;kiddies&quot; (we
were all kids at one point), spreadheads, administrators, people of
different incomes, oil changers, greasers, soc's, people who prepare and
serve your food, people who fix your broke stuff, the people who had a
hand in designing it..... and so on. ...from all walks of life.
    I don't think it takes too much to be tactful with what you write...
many people make the mistake of assuming that everyone else on the List
is like them, or ought to be like them. ...and that's just not the way
it is.
    ...which is why we seldom see any rebuttals or conflicting responses
to Thom, et.al.'s, anti-groovy-people trolls. Most of the time, cool
people just ignore the self-righteous diatribes and go on with life....
but sometimes something's gotta be said, just to let the rest of us who
somewhat suffer in silence (on this otherwise pleasant and informative
list) know that we are not alone.
    I'm not just talking about groovy people either.... goes for anyone
that has been slighted due to another's lack of manners. I do understand
however that, Marijuana Prohibition being in effect, we have more or
less adopted the Muskogee Contract as a matter of necessity.... &quot;we
don't smoke...&quot;.... so don't ask, don't tell, if you engage in that
habit.....
    Neither does this have to be a completely sterile environment....
just not a war zone, okay? We've had enough of the cyclical bashing for
a good while now, so please get over it... find something productive to
do with your time.
    After all.... how much logic does the following statement have: &quot;I
don't like hippies, DeadHeads, etc., so I think I'll go and moderate a
list about pre-'67 volkswagen buses.&quot;?
    ***note: I am *not* saying that we are all hippies/etc.... but,
sociologically speaking, there will be a good percentage of the above in
a bus list. guaranteed. and we can get along, in spite of some of our
beliefs. There have always been non-hippie bus owners, always will....
and the trend is going even moreso that way as time progresses... but
this still doesn't mean we have to focus on our differences... the
common ground is what's most important.
    Surely there is a place on usenet where the aforementioned bashing
is appropriate, encouraged and even appreciated... but it definitely
isn't here, or on the baywindow list either (see the Type2 List Admin's
response below...)...
    Thom... please confine your posts to something on-topic, without
bashing... or do the list a favor, step down graciously and let someone
more mature/tolerant/respectful take over the vintagebus list...

thanks,

Jason Black

Type2 List Admin's response:

&quot;    Hello all,
I thank the Type2 list members for not posting to Type2 on this thread,
and
this message is to preclude anyone who might be thinking about posting
to
Type2 on this thread.  Don't.

This is a Bus mailing list.  Hemp, hippies and the decline of western
civilization are not appropriate topics.  Now Buses -- there's a topic.

Thom, this really didn't need to be cross-posted to Type2.
