I see it as a time vs. dollars problem. If you have the time and few 
dollars, then collect the parts and put them on yourself. If you have 
dollars and little time, then buy the turnkey.

BTW I installed a 1776 into my bus and I am quite happy with the extra 
power. I also installed a 3.88 ratio tranee.
