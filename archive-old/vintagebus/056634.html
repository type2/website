Subject: Re: [VB] Re: Attn. all shoppers, black plate special on aisle 63

From the little bit of research I have done regarding Cali plates I have found a few tidbits of info.

The last total re-issue of plates was in 1963, with the black plates with yellow numbers/letters.  So technically these plates are still correct for your 57. So basically, the og owner probably had the yellow plates with black writing when it was new.  Then in 63 went to renew his registration and was given the new black plates and those have been on the car since.

&gt; You guys had me worried with these stories: today I registered a '57 with
&gt; Black Cali plates ( with yellow writing)in California I was afraid they
&gt; would take them but it had these from who knows when?? anyway I got to keep
&gt; them on it !!!( non op and change of ownership) the only bad thing was its a
&gt; Type 1 not a Type 2.  Lloyd

&gt; &gt;&gt; Don't forget boys and girls that to be correct for your pre '63
&gt; &gt;&gt; &quot;commercial&quot; vehicle ie: bus, you want the black on yellow plates with 6
&gt; &gt;&gt; digits spaced like this:   A  ##  ### .  The other type  like:  AAA  ###
&gt; &gt;&gt; are for cars.
