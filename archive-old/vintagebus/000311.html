Hi Pete,
Since they were on the rear of the bug you took them off of they probably are 
back up lights.  Yes, you can install a back up switch inbetween the speedo, 
and it's cable.  But this type of switch requires you to back up about a 
wheel turn to switch on the lights.  You might be better off rigging a 
switch, and lever on the body/shift linkage to switch it on immeadiately when 
you shift into reverse.
Then make brackets for the lights to mount them to the bumper bracket/bumper 
area, and have the lights inside of the overrider tubes.   Eric&amp;Barb
