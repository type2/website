Subject: Relief valves, ball vs piston 
Message-Id: &lt;199903130503.AAA04993_at_rotary.type2_dot_com&gt;

 Twice now I've seen it suggested that replacing the piston valves
in the oil relief valve setup with steel ball bearings . . is cool . .

 I have to disagree . . :-(   bummer . . :-)

 What I mean is,  I am not going to do this . . :-)

 Whether you have some measure of success with this &quot;cool&quot; fix,
or not isn't even in the equation . .

 Inside the &quot;valve-proper&quot; is a seat  . . circular, not spherical .

 A ball is not a cylinder . .  it may seal somewhat but a &quot;control
valve&quot; ?   no way . . . this thing leaks all the  time . .

 The piston has several features . . crisp opening is one, hollow as
it is it also has &quot;X&quot; surface area as opposed to the the exposed
nose on the pressure side . . even the mass of the valve is important
to this &quot;crisp&quot; and &quot;accuracy&quot; . . .speed  . . .

 Bergman is at the bottom of this  I imagine . .
Bernie B. clearly states that he installs his &quot;patented&quot; ball seat
converting the reliefs to a ball-bearing valve . .

 Note he has changed the seat from the cylinder to a spherical . .

 His ball still won't give you the same control that original piston
has . . but hey, whatever makes a buck . . .  :-)

 So yours leaks . . the standard piston job . . 

 get a stick that goes in the end of that piston valve, poke same
in same and put some lapping compound on the valve and get to
lapping that seat in there . . start with medium and then go to 
fine . .

 Same rules apply, when you get a full ring of bright on seat and
valve, you can stop . . paper towel on stick gets the lapping 
compound out of the valve . .

 Assume your piston is sloppy . . a no no . . they sell new ones
guys . . new springs too . . even sell an adjustable setup . .

 A new spring is a good investment after 30 years . . ?  :-)

 

 west . .  there's still some darkness . . :-)
