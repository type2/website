&gt; Hey all,
&gt;
&gt; I spotted a small heater rated for indoor use that
&gt; seems like it would do a good job of providing heat
&gt; for my Westy. It's called a Portable Buddy and can be
&gt; found, for those who are interested, at
&gt; http://www.mrheater_dot_com/buddy.htm . It can be operated
&gt; with disposable cylinders (expensive, environmentally
&gt; unfriendly) or with bulk tanks. They do recommend that
&gt; if using bulk tanks to keep them outside the enclosed
&gt; area and use their 5' or 12' hoses to fuel the heater.
&gt; My Westy originally had a gas heater and there is a
&gt; duct running into the bus from the engine compartment,
&gt; so there is the possiblity of keeping a small 4.5lb
&gt; cylinder in the engine compartment and running the
&gt; fuel line through the duct. I'm wondering about the
&gt; logistics of that though (at least while the bus is
&gt; being driven), would it be too hot there for the
&gt; cylinder? Now I could keep it there while using the
&gt; heater and then keep the cylinder somewhere else while
&gt; driving, but where? So, the &quot;burning&quot; questions are:
&gt;
&gt; 1. Would having a small propane cylinder in the engine
&gt; compartment be too dangerous while driving?

Probably not while driving, as the engine bay is cooled by outside air,
but I would be very leery of the probability of collision resulting in a
rupture of the tank.

&gt; 2. Is it safe to carry a propane cylinder inside the
&gt; bus? If not, where on a VW is?

Under the floor is the accepted location.  On a roof rack would be second
choice.

&gt; 3. Is it really necessary to keep the propane cyinder
&gt; outside while using the heater, or is that just a CYA
&gt; statement from the manufacturer?

The requirement is common sense.  If your system is leak-free, you can put
everything inside, but eventually everything leaks.
