Subject: Flasher?

Hey Y'all,

                    Got this 63 Panel I been tinkering with and  in my attempts to get her roadworthy I noticed my four way flashers do not work. I've got a diagram off of the VB site, even had it blown up to about 18x24 and laminated, anyway I realized that this diagram has depicted a &quot;flasher relay&quot; and an &quot;emergency flasher relay&quot;. My bus doesn't have two relays let alone a stock one. My bus has some cheezy three prong flasher, you know the silver round universal type. My local FLAPS has an old four pin NOS flasher but the pin #'s do not match up. I want my four ways to work and so I'm up for some suggestions on what some of you have done to your busses and the names of any vendors that might sell such parts. Thanks in advance
