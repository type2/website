Subject: Overdue Rust Repair

Hey there, I'm gonna start repairing some rust areas on my bus soon. What is
the correct gauge sheet metal for body panels. Also, has anyone tried the
rear corners from Bus Boys? They say that the panel goes above the tail
light holes, which is what I'm looking for, unfortunately :( I just got some
10&quot; high ones for WW, but the gauge looks pretty thin and they are all
lumpy. Should I even be looking for the perfect repair panel?

Thanks alot!
