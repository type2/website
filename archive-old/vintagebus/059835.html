hep me, hep me Jesus

Anyone know the url for those Muir engine sounds?  I thought I had it =
bookmarked but that link is now dead.  Have they been moved somewhere?

I've got a very unhealthy engine noise.  At first I thought it was a =
valve noise so I adjusted my valves and that didn't cure anything.  So =
I'm pretty much lost.  I guess I'll have to buy a torque wrench and =
re-torque my heads - what else should I consider doing. =20

When I adjusted my valves the adjusting screw closest to the front on =
cylinder 3 seems out pretty far.  I looked at my valve cover to see =
signs of any contact between that adjusting thing and the cover but I =
noticed nothing.
