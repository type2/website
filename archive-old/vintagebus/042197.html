&gt; Hi, just back from Prescott.  Hope everybody had a good time, I sure did!
&gt; 
&gt; It was my first trip &quot;anywhere&quot; in my 62, and my first real highway miles
&gt; on my new 1600DP BAP motor.  According to the gauge it got pretty warm
&gt; back there, and I'd appreciate opinions.
&gt; 
&gt; I have a VDO gauge, the sender is tapped into the case on the bottom.
&gt; My gauge reads 120-180-210-250-300, usually hangs around in the 210
&gt; range in town.  It got to 250 at the top of the hill, I stopped at the

&gt; Oh yeah, allow me to deliver an anti-testimonial about BAP.
&gt; 
&gt; They put a little tag on the block, with a drop of solder in the center.
&gt; Block gets to oh, 225, solder melts, warranty void.

Only if it says so in the warranty.  They have delivered to you a device
that, if installed properly and driven according to VW's instructions
(which don't mention temperature at all!), should function as advertised
for the warranty period.  The &quot;tell-tale&quot; is just an excuse to get out of
covering a poorly-assembled engine.  It may well be that the assembly
itself accounted for the overheating!

The only GEX engine I got had a tell-tale on it, glued to a thick layer
of paint on the side of the sump.  I removed it with my fingernail and
kept it nice and safe just in case it ever needed to be reinstalled.
Alas, the engine burned a valve at about 40K carefully driven miles in a
bug.
