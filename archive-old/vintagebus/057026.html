I think it's VWOA that's beating an old (40) horse!
Bastards! They should have spent this wasted time on a
better design for their new &quot;aerobus&quot;.

&gt; &gt;For anyone else who may not know, In a nutshell,
&gt; Volkswagen of 
&gt; &gt;America is coming down very hard on
&gt; &gt;many small businesses and web sites that promote
&gt; products for VW's. 
&gt; &gt;Any company that has the word
&gt; &gt;&quot;bug&quot; or &quot;bus&quot; in their name is in danger of a
&gt; lawsuit from VWoA.
&gt; 
&gt; Sounds to me like the infamous &quot;kitty litter letter&quot;
&gt; that many 
&gt; journalists get. Use the words &quot;kitty&quot; and &quot;litter&quot;
&gt; together in a 
&gt; national publication and you get a letter from
&gt; Ralston Purina (or 
&gt; whichever corporation currently owns the trademark
&gt; for Kitty Litter.) 
&gt; I've never heard of any actual legal action. It's
&gt; just something a 
&gt; company has to do to protect a trademark in this
&gt; Byzantine era of 
&gt; intellectual property laws.
&gt; 
&gt;   I'm guessing the most appropriate action to a VWoA
&gt; threat is to say 
&gt; &quot;ha! Ha! Ha! I got the kitty litter letter.&quot; But I'd
&gt; make sure I 
&gt; opened any subsequent certified mail.
&gt; 
&gt; Sorry if I'm beating a dead horse to death  here.
