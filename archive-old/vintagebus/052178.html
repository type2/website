Subject: Re: [VB] Spindle threads



&gt; Any help would be appreciated.  I took off my drums today to check my
&gt; cylinder, and the previous person who did this mangled the threads when they
&gt; put it on.  Now I need to, if I can, find a tap for the spindle

Actually, you need a die. A tap is for threads in a hole......

&gt; to try and
&gt; repair the threads or replace the whole spindle.  Does anyone know what the
&gt; thread size is on a 67 front end spindle and if I can buy that size tap?
&gt; Does anyone in the San Jose, Ca area have an extra right side 67 spindle nut
&gt; that I can buy?

It is very fine. You will probably only find a thread file available. It is
designed to 'file' the threads to repair them. Make sure to use a metric one.
Your 67 should have 2 nuts with a lock plate between them. Horrible system.....
Got any self-serve wrecking yards near you? Go get 68-79 bay window bus nuts.
They are the clamp style with an allen bolt.
