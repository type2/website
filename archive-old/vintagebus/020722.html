Subject: Polishing Aluminum

I am restoring a 66 Deluxe and all the aluminum
beltline trim looks all dull and crappy.  I was
thinking that I would try to polish this myself but I
have no experience in this.  What tools and products
would I need and are there procedures to follow?  Is
this too hard to do or should I have someone do it?  I
am trying to conserve cash because my tight-fisted
wife is complaining about how much I spend on old cars.
