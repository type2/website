&gt; Are you sure about the bore diameter? My 67 dual circuit master cylinder was
&gt; (is, since I still have it in the garage) 22mm and the 72-79 that I put on 
&gt; my SC, thanks to your article and the adapter plate from Ovals, is 24mm. 

Hi Ray,
Well three or four year ago we were certain after going through most of our 
repair manuals and finally found one that stated the 72 and later had a 22mm 
diameter.  Since you asked, we tried to measure the bores of a 67  and 72 and 
later MC.  The 72 and later MC has a slightly bigger bore for about an inch 
before reducing down to the bore which the pistons ride in, so we could not 
measure it directly with our caliphers.  Did measure the metal pistons and 
came up with 23.61mm.  So back though our manuals again.  Found that the 
1971, 72, &amp; 73 &quot;Without Guesswork&quot; manual that we got last year states that 
the bore diameter for the tandem master cylinder used from Chassi No. 211 2 
000 001 (1971) has a bore diameter of 23.81mm.  Checking our 1963-67 VW bus 
shop manual, it list 22.2mm diameter bore for the 1955-67 MCs.  Darned!  Well 
good to know.
  So it does look like using the 72 and later MC will make the brakes need a 
little more leg power to work them.  We just never noticed the differance 
when we switched our 1960 panel camper to 72 and later dual MC or since in 
the last three years, even with our 1963 SC with 64-67 wheel brakes and 
1955-67-1/2 single circuit MC as a control during this time.  Would be nice 
if someone who has more education in brakes could figure out how much leg 
pressure or at least % differance it is.  For now we will stay with the 72 
and later MC in our 1960 panel camper conversion and will convert the 1963 SC 
to the 72 and later dual MC very soon.  Yes, it is less expensive at about 
$40.00 instead of the 67 $150-200.00 and that does help, but having it 
availible anywhere from FLAPS in the USA when were are on our trips makes it 
really makes the differance for us.
