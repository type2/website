Subject: My deck height figures and other stuff.

Okay everyone (especially you gurus).  I've got all my pistons and cylinders
installed on this engine and they are being held in place with some plastic
bushings which I installed on the cylinder studs and then capped off with a
washer and nut.  All surfaces were thoroughly cleaned with brake kleen prior
to assembly and wiped down with a rag.  Here's my deck height figures in
thousandths which involved using a straight edge, feeler guages, and
ensuring a TDC for each piston:

#1    .049
#2    .042
#3    .046
#4    .054

Also, a preliminary test fit of each cylinder into the head revealed a lot
of slop.  I don't know if this is normal or not.  The diameter of the hole
in the heads is 99.13mm and the cylinders measure 98.02mm for a difference
of a little over a one millimeter in diameter.  Is this normal?  Maybe it
has to be slightly over cut in order for the variances of the case and P/C
setup?

What's the prognosis doctors?   I'm on my way out to CC the heads now.  Wish
me luck!
