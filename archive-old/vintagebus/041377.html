Subject: West Wa Spring Meet
Message-ID: &lt;Pine.A41.4.21.0005011254440.91438-100000_at_dante35.u.washington_dot_edu&gt;

  Yesterday was the Western Washington spring meet and it was really a
successful event for all.  I got down, from just north of seattle, to the
site at around 9ish and got a good parking spot up front.  I drove the
F*rd cause I've been in a situation before where I'd got a clip that was
just not gonng go into a bus of mine because it was either to big or to
damn dirty.  Plenty of the local busses came out and were in the lot, some
were in such good shape that I was wondering why they weren't
inside!  Other busses are so bad that it makes me wonder if it's actually
safe to drive.  
    Around 930 they started letting everyone inside the event.  I guess
all the people that were in line and ready got to get in for free.  I'd
estimated around 600 people got inside without paying the 6 or 7 dollar
fee.  Opps.  Once inside, it was a b-line for the swap, cause I've had my
eye on a number of odd parts that I've needed for a while(but will never
pay ebay prices).  Within 5 min, i wasn't finding much of anything to my
liking.  10min later, I got the score of the day! I got a set of cargo
doors, both straigh and dry, complete with windows rubber, latches, etc
etc all for a grand total of 50 bucks!  After that I just picked up some
nicnak stuff: a lil deluxe trim ends, some body panels, etc.  Still, I
didn't find the one major thing I needed: windshield gutter
frames! Someone was selling a complete front clip, but it was to far gone
for my liking.  I stopped by Wolfsden imports to check out the TMI stuff,
and was thrilled to see this stuff for the first time and I can't wait to
get an order in!(hey, does anyone have the interior trim they want to
sell?)  After that it was on to the car show, which was sorely lacking in
the aircooled bus catagory.  Maybe 3 splits! Ty's is always a site to
see.  Then I just looked around and met some friends and smiled at
listmembers who probably don't have a clue who I am.  

So, tossed all my junk into the ford, took another jaunt around the
lot(nice slider westy, 58 23 window fs, blue kombi that was belle, etc
etc).  Grrr who knows when mine will be there, but it will be! Where were
all the other busses at the show?!! If you got one, show it!
