&gt; Sunbrella is the material Dawn was using for the sundial tents I believe.
&gt; It's pretty damn thin........
&gt; I think she used German Canvas for the tilts,
&gt; Sunbrella tilts would be pretty damn delicate.

&gt; FWIW I looked at Sunbrella fabric when deciding on what to have my tilt made
out of.  If you want a stronger, longer lasting fabric with a variety of
colors, finishes, etc. its  probably the best fabric out there.  Its also
more expensive than the &quot;#8 duck canvas&quot; which the og tilts appear to be
made of, and does not look at all like the og tilts.  I chose to go with the
original #8 canvas because I wanted the tilt and hardware to match the
original. BTW, I think every one would be amazed at how little it actually
costs to have one made with the oem hardware, same canvas, all details, etc.
compared to what prices are being bandied about, if you are not in business
to sell them to someone else, and know where to get the hardware, who can
sew it, etc.

&gt; 
&gt;&gt; $500? The price sounds great but it makes me wonder if
&gt;&gt; this source for canvas uses the correct grommets and
&gt;&gt; other hardware? How's the quality?
&gt;&gt; PLF was going for what? $800 - $900, the canvas seemed
&gt;&gt; lightweight, and some have stated the seams aren't
&gt;&gt; straight. I see the same prices for POS OG canvas that
&gt;&gt; is in worse shape than my internet stocks.
