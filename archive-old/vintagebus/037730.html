=====================================================

I am comfortable driving my 67 at 55-60mph, I'm sure it's faster and probably would go 75mph?, but you couldn't hear yourself think let alone engage in a conversation with your passengers. I know that the combination of stock brakes, stock suspension and my reflexes are not up to safely reacting at those speeds. I enjoy driving my bus because it's slow. When I need to get somewhere in a hurry or prefer a more &quot;no nonsense&quot; form of transportation I drive the Toyota. Granted the bus is a fine German Automobile, and was developed in the land of the autobond, however, no matter the level of upgrades you perform to the transmission, suspension, engine or brakes will it ever be a Porsche, BMW or Mercedes. Enjoy your ride for what it is.

See you in Puyallup, I'll be there promoting the Jurassic Bug In. I have entered the 67 Westy in the Car Show and Have reserved a swap meet space. Daren, Nancy, Jack, Janelle and I will be there from Corvallis Saturday early evening, if anyone's interested in meeting somewhere for dinner or drinks email me directly and we'll try to set something up.
