Sorry to bother you all with such basics. I am mechanically
inclined,(mentally, as most of have opposable thumbs). I just need to know
where the brakes are adjusted on a 67 type 2(Singlecab).  I thought it
should be a slot in the backing plates where a flat driver could lever the
adjusting gear, but did not find a hole on my rear backing plates.  Where
and by what method do you adjust the fronts? rears?

Thankyou so much, I have a firm pedal, just too much play.
