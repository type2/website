Some questions on the list about these flaps
and linkages and pre/post '71 flaps  . .

Since I'm working on a shroud right now, I guess
I'm the expert . . :-)

First we have the flaps themselves . .
The flaps for a post 71 fit in the pre 71 . .

The doghouse or post 71 has a short linkage on each
of the flaps that just move the link mounting point
out farther away from the shroud to clear all the
doghouse stuff on the front of the shroud . . the
turbo chamber mainly . .

If you needed pre 71's you'd just take that short link
off and use a 4 hole cross-linkage . .
 Or not . . you could use the whole post 71 setup but
it would be standing out from the shroud about 3&quot;.

On the doghouse the cross linkage is a deeper bend still
and only has two holes . .

If you have flaps and can get a glimpse of what the links
look like, you should be able  to fab yourself . .
