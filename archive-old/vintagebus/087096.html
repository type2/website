&gt; ....new to Vintagebus site

Welcome!

&gt; My first project is to replace the fuel tank.
&gt; I bought a new tank from a California parts dealer.
&gt; Looking through the Tech articles I found a very informative piece by
&gt; Richard Atwell(DIY Fuel Tank Restoration). The article has made me wonder if
&gt; the tank I bought is good quality and weather I should I consider sealing
&gt; the inside with this product Por-15.

If the tank is new and never had gas in it it would be an excellent time
to seal it with the POR.  Be sure to follow the instructions exactly!  You
won't have to worry about corrosion for a very long time!
