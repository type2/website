Has anyone ever ordered parts form Axel Stauber in Germany? Did you actually get them?? I ordered an early bus catalog and a third brakelight lense for my bus 4 months ago and have yet to see anything. I repeatedly faxed them for an answer and recently phoned them and was told they had just sent it? Its not a huge deal but it is $40 And I was really looking forward to the catalog as their beetle catalog is full of hard to find parts. ( including every 36hp engine part you could ever need, not to mention the German DM is the only currency worth less than the Canadian loonie) Just letting off some steam... Trevor
