Hey folks,

I just started work on my new '62 bus. It has a '79 tranny conversion
(basically the complete
torsion tube assembly cut from a bay and welded to the split chassis) so
it's basically '79 running
gear down to the wheels.  Now hen I was doing my pre-MOT stuff I found
that one of the rear wheels
had a slight wheel bearing &quot;knock&quot; - so I figures that the wheel
bearings must be shot. Went down to G&amp;S and bought the inner and outer
and seals. Put the whole lot in and it's still the same! So I jacked the
other side up and that also has a slight knock.

The hub is so simple that nothing could be wrong inside it, yet you can
see the CV joint move up and down when you rock the wheel, so it can
only be the bearings. The nut is tight, the axel shaft was a nice tap-in
fit through the bearings, so I don't know what's up.

Question is therefore, is this small amount of &quot;play&quot; normal for a bay
window ?

The big book specifies a small &quot;noticeable&quot; amount of play in the front
wheels bearings
as being correct.

Lee.
