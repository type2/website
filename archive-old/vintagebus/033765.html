    I just got off the phone with Rich from OE VDub, he just informed me
that to get to 11 mile camp ground you go right past his place. He also told
me there is a camp-ground right next to his place and 11 mile hotel across
the street.  He is checking into camp-ground rates at the place next to him,
in case 11 mile is full, he also said anyone can camp at his place if they
want.  He is PAST RMMW, so you pass them to get to the camp-ground (which is
on a lake he said). Also he gave me a different way to go to Bandimeir?
without backtracking.  He will be open on Friday and Sat afternoon for shop
tours if anybody would like to see a bunch of Genuine VW and OE manufactured
VW parts.
