&gt; From what I understand, the &quot;Freeway Flyer&quot; Trannys

&gt; someone good with tranny skills to take your stock
&gt; gearbox, and turn it into a freeway flyer. anyone know
&gt; who does this? am i totally wrong?

Any good transaxle builder can change your R&amp;P.

There are things to watch out for, though.  Bus 4.12 R&amp;Ps (the shortest
I'd go with a 1600, personally. I run one in the '66 and it's great. 70-75
without hassles. With a good engine, of course.) are rare, so most
builders use bug based 4.12s.  Bus 4th's wont work with these without
modification.  You have to machine the bus 4th to fit.  Often you'll find
that the builder has gone the cheap way and put the bug 4th in.....which
leaves you with a higher 1-3, but a 4th thats just as tall as your old
one. (I dont have the numbers on hand, since all of my notes (my
workstation!:) is in a box at the house...but as I recall the bus 4th is a
.89 and the bug is a .83 or some such.)

3.88s have similar issues...there never WAS a bus 3.88, so you have to use
a compatable 4th.

Search the archives, look in various Bentleys, run some torque/horsepower
curves against the RPM/speed curves of your planned new box.  Transmission
gearing is not something you can just toss around and expect to work.  It
takes a good amount of forethought and understanding to redesign the
system.

i'll stop babbling now. :)
