Subject: Re: emissions failure - advice?

...
  matt sez:

&gt;If nothing else, lean it out as much as you dare and try again.  Note
&gt;that this will probably make the CO go up somewhat, but you've got
&gt;a bit room to maneuver on that account.


see, this is why i hate carbs :) half of the advice has been &quot;lean 
the crap out, add alcohol, etc.' the other half is 'too lean! richen!'


&gt;George and/or other Cali listees may correct me, but I recall seeing
&gt;&quot;no pass, no pay&quot; emissions test stations out there several years ago.

haven't found one here yet - got one guy who said he'd test it after 
each tweak, but at his prices i can fail the test 3 or 4 times and 
still be ahead........
