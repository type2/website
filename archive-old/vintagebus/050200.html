Subject: Finally getting to the engine...

I was SUPPOSED to get to my engine knocking problem Sat. but of course put
it off. So I'm finally just about to go out and check the valve adjustment.
I was wondering if there would be any reason that the valves would suddenly
go out of adjustment? I figure any reason isn't good. Thought I'd see what
you all have to say about that.

More than likely I will have to pull the engine and tear it down to some
degree. I've pulled and put an engine in before, so I'm not too worried
about that. But I have NEVER tore into an engine. I've got the engine
rebuild book and have kept it at my work to read while I'm in the &quot;throne
room&quot; (you guys know where I'm talking about). It's helped me a little to
kind of understand and engine and what goes into rebuilding it. But like I
said before, I've got absolutely NO hands on experience. I'm a little
concerned about doing anything, but can't afford to take it somewhere and
have it done. The engine was running perfectly fine before the knocking
began. And it really seems to be fine still. So I thought I'd go at it
looking to find and fix the knock. Am I a little nieve thinking I can do
this myself and that I can just fix the problem and put it back together?

I'm very nervous, but also poor. The poor part always encourages me to try
things myself. Usually will take me a while to get things done. But I come
out of it OK. So what do you guys think?
