&gt; Basically take it all apart and then put it back together!

&gt;From experience, I can tell you it's not that easy. Especially the first time.
I ruined many a speedo while I was learning the resto process. When Idid the
article for VW Trends Henry didn't want me to show the process for resetting
for fear that too many others would try it themselves with no luck. I figured
that'd be good for me and business, but he wouldn't let me.
