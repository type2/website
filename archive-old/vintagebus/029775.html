&gt; &gt;And the L M and U bands?  Does anyone know if the thing would
&gt; &gt;get FM or AM out here?
&gt;
&gt; L = shortwave (1.5 to 3 MHz), not very useful in the US
&gt; M = US AM (540 to 1610 KHz), the US AM band was later expanded upward
&gt;       to 1710 KHz, so this radio may not pick up some newer stations
&gt; U = US FM (88 to 108 MHz)

1.5MHz = 1500 KHz
the L band will pick up 1610 to 1710 KHz just fine.
1650 AM is where I find the Dodgers and UCLA football (shhh, don't tell my USC
daughter)

Drive around at night and you can pick up all kind of foreign broadcasts on the
L band, many of them actually in english.
