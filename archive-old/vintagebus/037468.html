was writ stuff like:

 This is a very strange but important subject and sort of a catch 22 at
that.  Do I stop and help or just jam on?  I have met some of the nicest VW
people on the shoulder of the road and I wouldn't trade these friendships
for....
-  --  - --

this is funny dilemma- some of this threads of all these vintage vw heads
saying the hippy vwheads are freaky freaks.  I'll stop for pretty much anyone
with a broken down bus, unless they look scary dangerous, but I've never had
that happen.  I've had people say they ran out of gas, or lost a hub cap and
were looking for it or  needing a accelerator cable wire repair or various
most difficult things went wrong.     most all the time happy folks happy to
see a bus stop and of course tend to check it out.      Because you have
dreadlocks or purple hair or whatever doesn't mean you are less (or more)
deserving of help than someone else, in MOPBO.    I've seen many flaky slacker
people who dress straight, and barefoot hippies with natti dreadlocks with
good jobs and  blah blah blah whatever- it's just a social group, like any
else, but maybe more noticable.     

(goin' down the road in a big purple box,
barefoot hippys with natty dreadlocks
everything's groovy then the tire pops.)

btw, i'm not big on drum circles, don't want dreadlocks, but I have gone to
rainbow gatherings and had fun.


 Chris &amp; I  stopped almost at Needles by the side of the road- the engine was
getting hot and he wanted to let it cool down.   Was  above 240 and rising and
the air temperature was above body temperature.   The sun was getting low on
the horizon, and saw some shade by a hill, so swooped on that.   Okay, so
maybe he's a little anal about not wanting to overheat, but that's not a bad
thing at all.   I was happy to wait a little by the road, after driving for
hours.  We had a squirt bottle of water I was using liberally on our skin- in
the dry heat it's a wonderful thing- else i would be melting.    And up pulls
a couple buses- fresh from Jerome- Bradley in his red bay and rex in his sweet
westy.   Said, nope, not broken, just trying to chill it.  Talked about the
Spit Test and it's scientific ness and about Jerome and I explained that I
went to sleep so early on Saturday night was that really it was about 3am by
my internal clock which had not yet synchronised to west coast time, or one
hour east of, although the tequila may have helped.   Assured we were in no
distress, they split while we waited for it to get under 180 and then kept
going into Gneedles.   It was nice to have people stop, though. Kinda like the
warm fuzzies.
Got gassed in Needles, then up the hill on the other side- and agin the air
temp is still above body temperature and the bus is getting hot, so we stop
halfway up the hill for a ten or 15 min break.     Back on the road got up the
rest of the hill and soon it has dropped to a cool 90 degrees and all is well.
It was just so hot there down in that river valley which traps the heat in and
the hills made that more fun for the bus.  thus my explanation.     Seemed
like a good place to find dry buses though. hope no offense is taken.
