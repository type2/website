Subject: Re: [VB] What is the toughest climb you ever drove?

I remember a couple really long hills when I left Albque, heading to Colorado
Springs,
I think it was North of Taos, Past Ft Garland, there is a really long hill
called La Veta Pass

There was one before that,, with switch backs near the top... but I can't
remember where it was,,

We left Albque, headed north for Santa Fe, Following the Rio Grande, To Colorado
, Ft Garland, then headed for I-25 for Colorado Springs.
