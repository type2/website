&gt;I am having some
&gt;problems, when I put in my clutch the car dies. It will idle OK if I leave
&gt;the clutch out but won't move if I don't engage the clutch. Need to get
back
&gt;on the road.
&gt;

Not much information. What motor, tranny, carb? I will assume it is a
splitty bus. Does it stop hard when you push in the clutch, load up and die
gradually as you push in the clutch, or just kinda coast down? If it's one
of the first two, maybe endplay, last one something grounding on the
throwout arm or clutch cable, or maybe a bare wire hitting the clutch pedal
up front? What have you checked?
