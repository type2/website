Subject: Re: Emergency Flasher/ Wirirng Q's

This is going to get expensive!
 Thanks Matt for the advice. I now have flashers! Well, three at least, the passenger side front will not flash with the emer lights but It's better than it used to be! I'll have to keep on playing around with them.
I have no idea where you live or what shows you go to, but I owe you a beer. Look for a line in front of a Westy, that will be me! 
Thanks again,
Sean

Light travels faster than sound. 
This is why some people appear bright until you hear them 
speak.
