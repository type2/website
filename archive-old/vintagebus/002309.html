  Hi Volks,
 I am in need of a seat bottom for my '59 single cab.  I have a back rest for 
a '61-'62 hump/back seat that I want to use but any year one piece bottom 
will be fine.
 I also need rear bumper guards and over riders for my truck.  I'll be going to
Jerome so if anyone who is going has anything I need let me know and I'll
meet with you there.
 Thanks,
Lou in Havasu
&quot;You know your in Arizona when..........
    you see Lou driving his 1st bus w/a big smile&quot;
P.S. My '59 SC is a non-Ronnie bus/truck!
