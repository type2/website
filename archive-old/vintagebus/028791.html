Subject: '59 Kombi...disty

RE: '59 Kombi w/ 1600 DP engine.

This past weekend my disty cap became toast. On Sunday I pulled the 
whole thing and plopped the 009 from my wife's car in to get me by. i 
decided to try another disty, as I wasn't sure how well the one I had 
in was performing. I never really found out exactly what car/engine 
it was from and had a hard time finding the right kind of points ect. 
I was lucky enough to be given another vacuum advance distributor by 
a friend. It was marked as a 050, but was a vacuum advance. It came 
out of a late model bay window bus and takes 009 cap, rotor, points, 
ect. So that's what I wanted. Something that's easy to get parts for.

I tried it earlier this week with no luck. I went back today 
realizing I probably hadn't seated it all the way. Turns out that was 
it. I timed it 7.5 BTDC and went for a test drive. Man...what a 
difference.

  Compared to the first disty that was in there, the engine seems to 
have more power. AND the idle was right at the 850 area. I couldn't 
ever get that to happen before.

Compared to the 009, the engine still has more power and runs tons 
smoother. Plus, I had the same problem with not getting the idle low 
enough with the 009 as well. But the main difference was smoothness.

Now, I havn't done a full test drive. Just a couple of miles. I'll be 
driving my bus to work tommarrow and will find out for sure. But it 
really seems to be much better now.

FYI: the distributor is a Bosch 050 #231 168 015. It shows as from a 
transporter 10/75-2/79.

Now onto the carb. I picked up one of those little adapters that lets 
you put a single-port carb on your dual port engine. So I'm gonna try 
to put one of the 30 PICT carbs I've got here on and see how it does 
in comparison to the 34-PICT that's on there.
