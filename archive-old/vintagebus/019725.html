I like the method of grounding the points.  The reason for this is that the
VW won't be completely dead, thus it won't be obvious that the VW not
starting is a simple theft deterrent.  Probably the would-be thief will just
wonder why he/she thought the VW would start in the first place ;-)  It will
just crank and crank and crank...you may end up with a dead battery.  Better
than a missing bus.

When I have done this (not on my previous Kombi, but on all the b*gs and to be
on the Westy) I put one switch somewhere in the cab and one in the engine 
compartment.  I usually just flip the switch in the cab to ground the points
if I'm just leaving for a while, but flip the one in the engine compartment
too, and lock the compartment, if I'm going to leave the vehicle for a while.

If you have an ultra-secure '67 without even a church-key engine lid lock, you 
will need to get a locking latch.

Just one way :-)
