If you're not into welding, you might try using POR Putty (from the
POR-15 people) to seal up the rust holes once you've prepped the area. 
I used a combination of POR-15 and POR Putty to recondition the battery
tray on my 67 DC, and they worked great.

&gt; I'm in the process of adding Safari Windows to my current '67 Camper
&gt; restoration.  I pulled my front windshields today, and was surprised to
&gt; see quite a bit of surface rust at the bottom of the channels where the
&gt; rubber holds the glass.  I put a wire brush into my drill motor and
&gt; cleaned it out the best that I could.  The surface on the bottom of
&gt; these channels is very rough and bumpy.  There are also a couple of
&gt; places that have rusted through, with the holes about as big as the end
&gt; of a pencil erasure.  My question is, should I have these channels
&gt; grinded down smooth, which will probably create some more small holes,
&gt; have the holes welded up and smoothed?  Or, can I simply apply body
&gt; filler over the entire area and sand it smooth.  I'd hate to have to cut
&gt; out the entire channels and have them replaced, especially since there
&gt; are only 3-4 small holes.  Does anyone know if the rust will keep on
&gt; deteriorating the metal, even if I primer and paint over it?  I don't
&gt; want to have to re-do this all in a couple of years, or even think about
&gt; it ever.
