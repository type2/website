Subject: RE: [VB] color of pedal pan

&gt;I just went out and looked at all of the ones I have and they ALL appear
to be gray primer, most of the primer is gone and has turned to surface
rust though.  lots of pans post 55 to 67 and one pre 55 thats black?
&gt;
My Barndoor pedal pan is black but I painted it black.

I think I painted it black because it already was black, though.
