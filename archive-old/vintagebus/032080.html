 Any tip's out there in installing the insert material
 into deluxe trim?  It seams to me like i will need to
 soften the insert up a little to make it plyable
 enough.

yes, heat it up to soften it.  A hair dryer should do it fine. perhaps some 
Wd-40.   something non metallic to push the trim strip into place, such as a 
wooden popsicle stick.  maybe wax the aluminium trim first- keep it shiny and 
non oxidising?
