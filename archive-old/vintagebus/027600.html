&gt; What year was the Z-Bed removed from... I am assuming that it came from a
&gt; big window.  Thxs.
&gt;


I'm not sure, maybe Rex knows what year his came from,  it was from a bay
window bus, and the fabric was blue-green plaid, my guess is 73, 74, but I
really have no idea.  Any year that used full length z-beds would work
perfectly I would assume.  I suppose a 3/4 z-bed would also fit but then
you'd be stuck with using a cabinet or something.  Check with rex he likely
knows what years his seat came from, and his site has a nice pic of the
set-up - mind is the same but the colour is a different.

I didn't even take off the original material from the z-bed, I just added a
thin layer of foam and recovered it in vinyl to match my from seat.  I also
got the arm rests that came with the z-bed and recovered them to match the
z-bed and the front seat.

For me the set-up is perfect, if I had a camper then I would need a separate
bus to hual stuff and be a daily driver, this set up fill both needs.
