I recommend disconnecting the push on wire from the sender and grounding it.  
have your wife or someone turn the ig on (not start motor) and look atthe 
guage.  does it read all the way to full?   if so your guage is working fine 
and your sender is having issues.  

One thing your post makes me wonder if if you have a 15 gal tank and a sender 
for a 10 gallon tank.   If so, once the gas level is below the sender, it 
will read empty, but you will still have maybe 5 gal in the tank.  THis was 
how the 59 truck I had was- the guage only read for the top 10 gallons.    
The sender works fine for 6 or 12 volts, doesn't matter.  6V guages do often 
keep working fine on 12V but again I have heard it shortens their life.

Meanwhile, I recommend keeping a small spiral notebook in the bus, and 
writing down fill ups- milage and how much.  you can calculate your MPG and 
know when you have to put gas in it by.   and also use the book to mark when 
you do tune ups etc.

Gas guages are accessories, you dont really need them.

&lt;&lt; Sorry, I was asking about pulling the sender not whether it was the
 sender that was bad or not, but hey, any experience is always nice. It
 is a 65 bus. The previous owner converted the bus to 12 v but I don't
 know if he changed the sender or the guage. I have used the guage for
 almost a year. Up untill recently when I would fill up it used to go up
 to inbetween full and 3/4 and when it said empty I could put in about 8
 gallons. My wife is the only one who has ran it out of gas and she said
 it happened right after the guage said  empty. Now I fill it up and it
 says just under a half, and at empty I can only put in 2 1/2 to 3
 gallons. I know it is a stock bus guage, but I don't know if the
 previous owner changed it or not. I figured that it had developed a hole
 in the float. The bus had sat for 14 years before I put the last 10,000
 mile on it.It started happening on our way back from California. I am
 getting 11.5 volt at the positive pole on the guage and about 30 ohms of
 resistance between the poles of the guage. The spare guage I used was a
 motorola 12v fuel guage. I know that it might read different than the
 stock guage, but it reads exactly the same as the guage that I have in
 there. Also I will climb in the engine compartment and check the ground
 wire on the sender. I hadn't thought of that.
