And Bill Collins will be entered again in his Heb - the first and only VW to
have ever participated.

&gt;    You all know what the Great Race is, right. Well, our illustrious tourism
&gt; board somehow talked them, Great Race (sponsored by the History Channel) to
&gt; make Lake Havasu one of there overnight resting places. So here's the deal,
&gt; on Thursday the 28 of June they arrive in Havasu, at 5pm the city is having
&gt; a little street fair in there honor, the cool part is that the streets (main
&gt; street) downtown will be lined with VINTAGE vehicles, including all the VW
&gt; Buses. so if anybody wants to come and see or join in feel free to come.
