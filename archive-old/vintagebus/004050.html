 Yeah, I had to run outside to make sure she was still in the 
 driveway when I read that post. It does sound a lot like Inge the bus,

 Is that Larry? The guy who delivered my Middle seat
&gt; from Solvang to a guy uo North?
 &gt; If so, it's a sweet all orig. Westy with original
 &gt; tent, potty toilet, etc. etc. etc.  And if so, sorry
 &gt; to see it on a trailer.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Early hatch-top westy sighting yesterday. Looked to
&gt; &gt; &gt; be 62-64 hatchtop with 
&gt; &gt; &gt; early woodslat rack on top. Colors were faded
&gt; &gt; &gt; sealing wax red with an 
&gt; &gt; &gt; off-white top.
