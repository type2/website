spoken like a true non head.  If the dead was a &quot;fad&quot; of your predecessors, I
must really be screwed up.  I saw the dead 13 times and the Jerry Garcia band
4 times before Jerry died and I'm only 25 now.  I was probably close to 22
when he died.   If you think the dead's just some passing trend, you should
head out to one of these events.  very few are merely falling for &quot;retro
marketing&quot; and they arent in it for the &quot;Drugs.&quot;  I also seriously doubt that
these people who appear to be barely hanging on are just &quot;dressing the part&quot;.
Your response is funny though, funny that you just dont
understand....ignorance is bliss maybe?  you've re4ad too many magazine
articles and seen too many off base movies.  Dead fans can take many forms
(I'm sure those that have met me would never think that I'd seen Jerry a
combined total of 17 times).  I'm sure most realize this, but you seem to be
confusing the younger &quot;piercing&quot; VW crowd ,as you call them, with the people
who follow the dead.  There is a big difference there.

I like the dead becasue they make GREAT music, it also happens that before and
after happenings at their shows are great fun too.  your assummption that VW's
and dead fans are merely 2 trends that have been around a bit too long is way
off base.

next time there's some sort of Dead function at Golden Gate Park, go check it
out.  It's a great time 

Matt
loud and proud dead fan.......and I even wear a shirt and tie to work for a
Fortune 500 comapny too........go figure?
