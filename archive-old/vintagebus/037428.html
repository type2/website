Sorry to say that the '58 Single Cab did not go to the Arizona Bus Club for
the next raffle bus.  In the process of trying to figure out how to view the
pictures that Andy sent me, the (in)famous bus-trader Sean &quot;Hormel&quot; Seitz
snagged it.  Perhaps the ABC could talk him out of it.  Who knows.

In any event, that is the kind of thing, score, deal, find, whatever that the
ABC is looking for.  A pick-up would be really cool to raffle off, but the
likelyhood of finding one worth doing in the ABC's price range (&lt;$1000) is
pretty small. 

But, if anyone knows of something.......Well, just keep us in mind.

Disappointed,

Jon Stanton, Prez.
