Subject:  RE: [VB] Amber turn signals?
Date: Mon, 7 Feb 2000 09:02:09 +1100 

The Aus version of the euro bus (?) had semaphores
until 60, 61 and 62 model years had separate round amber
amber lenses (hella lense exactly like the flat round red
US tail light lense with chrome bezel).  This separate amber
lense was located above
the round red tail light lense.....

Went to the oval amber/red rear lense combination
in 63.

I can take some pics of the amber hella round flat
lense with chrome bezel (phew!) if anyone would like
to see them.

&gt; &lt;&lt; I was just wondering when if at all taillights had amber lenses. I'm
&gt;  talking about turn signal portion here. Was it only available in Europe?
&gt;  Asking because I want to redo mine and would want to set it up as close
&gt;  to European stock as possible. Thanks for any advice.
&gt;   &gt;&gt;
&gt; 62 and later, the wiring was also slightly different.   N.  Am spec
&gt; included 
&gt; red taillights, no amber.   yes, the euro buses had them.
