Ric -

Don't do it!  I appreciate your ambition to demonstrate fire safety and all
that, but there aren't enough to go around to be torching drivable buses, no
matter what the cost.  What will you have left when you're done: another
charred piece of metal and a bus gone to waste.  The lesson's valuable, but
maybe there's another way?
