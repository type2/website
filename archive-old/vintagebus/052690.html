Subject: Re: [VB] muir's riser/rod rationale

ya, I remember that 'clogged heat riser will cause rod to burn' line, but it 
does not make sense now I think about it.  not everything he wrote is 
infaliable, so you gotta use some common sense.  This was the guy who would 
disconnect electric chokes.  I mean, he lived in Arizona, and I don't think 
his motor died from cold air going down the carb.  Bet he had warmer air 
going into the heads  than a bus does up north here even with heat riser and 
pre heat.

that said, clean out the heat riser anyway, it'll make your VW run smoother, 
especially in cold weather.

Get better  gas milage with warm fuel/air going into heads.
