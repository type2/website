Subject: Phat Boy from Aircooled_dot_net!

The Phat Boy from Aircooled_dot_net arrived yesterday...  Let me just say it is 
a work of art!  Absolutely beautiful in its quality of build.

I already had the Bugpack header installed (also from AC_dot_net) and so it was 
a matter of just putting the muffler on last night.  BTW the Bugpack header 
is very good for a &quot;budget&quot; header at about $65.  Minimal fuss and muss 
getting it on a couple weeks ago.  A little grinding here and there to get 
the inner welds nice and smooth, but no biggie.

The muffler literally went on in about 10 minutes!  It fit perfectly around 
the bumper and everything!  My wife was shocked when it did not take all 
night to get something done on the bus :)  She commented that it was the 
quickest project I have ever done on the bus.

Usually there comes a certain amount of cursing and metal beating with 
aftermarket mufflers, not this time.

As far as I know AC_dot_net has the only bus specific Phat Boy around.  The 
muffler was marked for a bus and everything, not just a one size fits all 
deal.

I am still in shock at how easy it was to install and the overall build 
quality.

So how does it sound?  Awesome!  It is deep and throaty but not too loud at 
the same time.  No fart can rice sound either.  Sounds very V-8ish.  And of 
course it breaths much better than the stiffeling stock setup.

Also it has a slash cut of the tail pipe that shoots the exhaust out to the 
side, very trick.

Sure this product is not cheap... But man is it nice and worth the price.  
Finally something that fits like it should!

Take Care,
Adrian &quot;phat polution shooter&quot; Pillow
