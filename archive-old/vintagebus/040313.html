Well,

I know that buses in Australia (built from CKD kits)
were painted (or repainted) in country in our 'own'
local variants of VW colours (acrylic laquers made by an 
Australian paint company called Dulux).  Hell
of a lot of original beryl green splits here  (beryl
green was supposed to be a type 1 colour).

I've never seen overspray on other major parts so
it looks like empty shells were painted and then
built up.  I would assume that major components
(engines, tansaxles, beams) were imported and installed
as units rather than individually assembled, because
this is the way it was for beetles here.

Oz is sorta unique in that we did have manufacturing
set-up in country for beetles.  (really beetle bodies
 we weren't forging cranks or cases or anything
else - these were imported and installed as units).

I've found it difficult to get any info on the assembly of 
CKD buses in this country.  

Were buses built from CKD kits RHD?  Could you
get LHD CKD kits?  Seems that all CKD assembly went on
in RHD countries?

Hey Volks

A question that's been on my mind for some time:

What exactly did CKD (Completely Knocked Down) mean with regard to VW buses?
All the Type2s built here in South Africa between 1955 and 1980 were built
from German CKD kits, as were the 1975-only run of Brazilian splitties. How
completely knocked down was a CKD kit?

Did it involve every individual part of a bus boxed for assembly like some
huge Meccano set? Were any parts of the bodyshell preassembled? Were engines
or other major subassemblies like transmissions and axles preassembled?

Does anybody know anything at all about VW CKD kits?
