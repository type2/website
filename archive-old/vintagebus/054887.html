Kelly,
       Those belly pans did fit quite nice...  Especially considering they 
were made by hand!  You are the &quot;metwiz&quot;.

       To all Listee's,  Don't give up.  There are shops out there that will 
fix rusty typeII's.  I'm not scared to tackle any bus, no matter the rust, 
and will still get your bus in and out, fully done, in 3-4 months, depending 
on just how bad it is.  We should start painting Dans Binz this week, today I 
plan to get the entire bottom side in POR15.  We started on Dans bus in mid 
August, should be done by the first week of Nov.  I also try and send 
customers digital pics everyother day of  progress.  So the worries of money 
sent with no work being done, are gone!

Happy v-dubing
