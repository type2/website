Subject: Re: [VB] Runs in paint

John,
I have no idea what type of materials you are using---or what the
temperature is where the Bus is---.

I had a parking lot scratch ( gouge ) in my passenger door---repaired
it-- sealed, and primed it 3 times, base coated and cleared it Saturday,
wet sanded an buffed it out yesterday. ( It's been in the mid to high
70's here

I favor PPG's Concept Urethane for it durability and fast working times.

I would think if the air temps are in the 70's --80's a day would be
more than enough to set up prior to hacking out the runs.

Give it the thumb test----shove your thumb into the paint--if it leaves
no fingerprint--your good to go--

The reason your getting runs is ;

(A) the product is over reduced
(B) your too close to the vehicle with the gun
(C) you have the volume knob on the gun WFO and it's blowing way too
much product.
(D) Your moving too slow
(E) your exctied to get the job done and simply laying waaay too much
product on too fast--multiple passes over the same area.

What I would do is DA the area's in question down with 320 and reblast.

Cut the throttle back on the gun
Lay multiple lighter coats
Move faster

You have a good base already--and if you take it easy--you'll wind up
with a nice finished product with one light pass over the whole top end
of the Bus.--

Never start wet sanding with 600--waaay too course.
You be sanding  the scratches out of the paint until the cows come
home---

Start with 1000 or 1500---then buff----the Finesse it --your done.

I used only 2000 prior to Finessing the paint---beautiful factory
new--high gloss paint job. 
 

Adios , and Good Luck--
