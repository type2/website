&gt; &gt; Anybody in the Baltimore (Washington DC, Philly, Delaware) region have
&gt; &gt; a car trailer they're looking to sell (or know of one).

have you checked U-haul in Baltimore on Orleans street, they have a lot of
stuff largest one around.   also what about a two wheel dolly, put rear
wheels on the dolly and tie the front wheeels straight ahead.

&gt; Similarly, if someone in the area has a bus tow bar they are looking to
&gt; get rid of...
&gt;
&gt; In that vein, I know its been done, but what are people's thoughts on
&gt; towing a splitty 200 miles on its rear wheels?

remove drive shaft, I know much harder on splitty.  short distances maybe
with engine in neutral, but there is the PA turnpike and I-70.  towing I
would go up the old road rt 144 and thru Uniontown....much slower and more
stoplights and small towns. but I wouldn',t do it more than 40/40

(40mph nor more than 40miles at a time)
