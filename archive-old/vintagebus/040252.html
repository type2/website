hey all...
i use this mechanic that has been in to ACVWs for a long time and im (was) 
confident he knows his stuff.  he's done a few things for me in the past, 
things i wasnt that comfortable doing myself.... he was able to free up my 
seized link pin on my previous bus. which at first he was convinced had 
CV's! he gets a little confused sometimes i think, i know i have the only 
split bus he sees. he's more in to beetles. i guess he used to be in to 
racing beetles and his son was killed street racing in a hopped up bug with 
an engine he built up.

anyway... there are not really *that* many ACVWs in the cleveland area, but 
you can find a 6 or 8 in his shop at all times. this guy is VERY grumpy and 
sometimes is just a dick! so i call him last week and ask if i can use his 
tire machine to swap the 185's that are on my bus for 205's cuz im riding to 
Auburn Hills next weekend. he says ok, come in after 1 on saturday. now, my 
wife and i moved in january so im not close to this guy anymore.

so i load up the 4 rims w/ tires and ride out to his place. i get there and 
walk in the shop. he is there at the counter rummaging through some papers, 
filling out a work order and he doesnt even acknowledge i just walked in. 
one minute.... two minutes..... five minutes... NOTHING! finally he looks at 
me and says, &quot;ok.... now what do you want to do today?&quot; i say, &quot;I just want 
to swap these tires so i can knock my engine speed down a bit on the 
freeway; im cruisin' at 4500rpm!&quot; he comes out to my bus looks around, 
checks out the tires, then he says, &quot;Oh, that wont do anything but knock off 
your speedometer.&quot; i think he is just messin with me, until he doesnt say 
anything else. he asks for the keys and starts up my bus. he looks at my 
tach while its idling at about 900rpm and asks how long i had the tach. he 
starts really reving her up and holding it at that 4500rpm mark and then 
gassing it some more. one time hitting the rev limiter. he shuts her down, 
gets out and tells me my tach is wrong and that 4500rpm mark i say im 
cruisin' at on the freeway is really about 3500. he claims that it cant be 
that high (4500) cuz i still have pedal after that. he says he has a racing 
engine that redlines at 9000rpm, and a good tach is $300 and he is really 
busy today, blah, blah, blah... so i grab the keys and say, &quot;thanks, but no 
thanks..... LATER!&quot;

so, anyway, thanks for reading... i thought this was a funny story about a 
guy i will never talk to again. and to think his shop has been open 30+ 
years. guess ill be riding to Auburn Hills _at_ 52mph!
