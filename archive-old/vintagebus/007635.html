Did you tighten your front end?  Are you going KC this weekend?  I know that
you are the weekend after but wasn't sure about this weekend?  Went camping
this weekend out at Lesara NE on the Platte this weekend.  Did a little
fishin'!  Was a cool place at a old sand pit where they had bought the whole
sandpit(Girl that we were visiting is the daughter of a ex Mutual of Omaha
Prez.) and was cool. On the way home it seemed like the bus did not have
much power but it was a lot windier today than it was on Sat night.  Got the
bug front end all apart and should of stayed home and finished that but I
wanted to go hang at a lake.  Let me know what you are going to do this
weekend as I am supposed to be off Fri, Sat, Sun and would like to see the
bug.  Got any pics yet??!!  See ya

Subject: Bus Probs - what's that sound?


&gt; Thursday morning of last week, I woke up with a sore dry throat - you
&gt; know...one of those sore nasal type jobbies.  I went to work anyway and
that
&gt; night my throat was even worse.  Friday morning it was definitely time to
&gt; call in and so I've had a nice 4 day weekend of which 3.5 days of it were
&gt; spent lolly gagging around the house doing such fun things as surfing,
&gt; copying songs to my empeg player, vomiting, hacking up more crap, etc.
&gt;
&gt; Why do I tell you all this - well, it's my excuse for allowing a problem
&gt; with my bus to go untouched for a couple of days. :-)
&gt;
&gt; Friday evening I managed to cruise out to Walmart and eat at their little
&gt; in-house cafe.  Just as I pulled out of the backyard, I heard a scraping
and
&gt; grinding noise from the front right tire area.  I suspected a bad bearing
&gt; because I could make the noise get louder and softer by wiggling the wheel
&gt; back and forth.  The bus sat in the driveway Sat., Sun., and Monday until
&gt; about 3:00 when I decided I felt good enough to take it over to the shop
and
&gt; work on it.  As it turns out, after I removed the drum, the top spring
that
&gt; holds the brake shoes together had snapped off on the end.  I don't know
&gt; what caused this but these are the brand new springs you get in the kits.
I
&gt; know the old stock springs that were on this bus were made of a thicker
&gt; guage metal.  I scrounged through my old pile of brake stuff and found me
a
&gt; spring.  I buffed it on the wire wheel and installed it, and to make a
&gt; longer story shorter, I put everything back together, adjusted the
&gt; headlights for the heck of it, and drove around town tonight for abot 40
&gt; minutes - problem solved.
&gt;
&gt; I guess I could throw in the part about adjusting the link pins and
greasing
&gt; the front end.  It took a little more grease but not much. It's only got
&gt; over 600 miles on it - all the tie-rod ends are still just as good as when
&gt; they went in - link pins weren't loose at all, so over all, everything
seems
&gt; fine.
&gt;
&gt; All fer now...
