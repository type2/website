In response about not taking a VW Bus on a road trip
to Alaska.......

Fred
I have been driving VW's for 32 years and I currently
drive a 67 Sundial Camper about 20 thousand miles a
year all across the US for weeks at a time with my
wife and son. I do spend much time doing PREVENTIVE
maintenance on my Bus before a long trip, but for the
shorter trips, we just get in and goooo...I do take a
set of tools and normally no spare parts with me. 

Please don't let a few list members scare you with
tales of gloom and doom on the road. I have never been
stranded anywhere in any situation where a little
thought and a couple of tools couldn't fix up the ol
bus. I have never not taken my bus anywhere on a road
trip for fear of 'breaking down'.
I'm not going to lead you to think nothing has ever
happened with any of my VW's on the road, but I have
always found a simple solution - or- someone's help
(thanks Ronnie) to get me back on the road. Thats part
of the adventure...
The only time I have ever been scary stuck was a
couple of years ago in the north east part of the
Black Rock Desert when in the middle of summer (110
degrees) I had to hike out about 35 miles (took all
night)to get help to my family back at the vehicle.
Thanks to the Washoe County Search and Rescue for
eventually getting us out of the desert. And this was
in my two year old Isuzu Rodeo 4 wheel drive !!!

Moral of the story is that shit happens and you never
know where or when it will strike (40 year old Bus or
a 2 year old 4wheel drive). Take your chances and
enjoy the ride.
