Subject: Re: [T2] RE: Trade web-site for a VW Bus--Contd.--

And here I had confined my reply to pmail to avoid embarrasing this 
gentleman.

--This guy owns vwclubs_dot_us and vwclubs_dot_com

--This guy has already got a cease and desist notice, predictably, he 
now admits

--This guy told VWOA in writing to get stuffed

--This guy now wants to trade the domains for a vehicle of some value 
(both domains for &quot;a nice one&quot;).

Uh, people can do what they want. Maybe somebody will go for his 
offer. =^ )

&gt; sent
&gt; the famous e-mail from their hot shot lawyer and I responded in a nice 
&gt; way
&gt; to take a flying leap and bring it on . I explained to her that it has
&gt; nothing to do exactly with the &quot;Volkswagen make&quot; but the community of 
&gt; people
&gt; that love those types of cars and if anything we are their biggest
&gt; advertiser for them it was some new lawyer with Volkswagen of America 
&gt; trying
&gt; to make a name for herself ... tell him thank you for the advise but I 
&gt; have
&gt; been there done that already and I'm still here tell him to go to
&gt; http://www_dot_netsol_dot_com do a who is lookup o the site vwclubs_dot_com and see 
&gt; how
&gt; long I have had it.... thanks jerry....Robert

&gt; Jerry, please, with all respect, this guy is a sitting duck with domain
&gt; names like that because of VWOA. Nobody would trade two dead flies for
&gt; them...
