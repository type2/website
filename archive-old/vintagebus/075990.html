Subject: cam timing

got a question about cam timing...
after several hours of futzing with a way to get my chinese dial 
holder to stay steady, i finally was able to get some reproducable 
numbers on my schneider cam:

max lift intake - .3523
IO - 0 TDC  IC - 40 ABDC  duration 220
exhaust - .3535
EO - 38 BBDC  EC - 8 ATDC  duration 226


card reads:
max lift .355
IO - 4 BTDC  IC - 36 ABDC   duration 220
EO - 43 BBDC  EC - 3 ATDC   duration 226
all at .050&quot;

so... i am willing to rack up the camlift diff to my sloppy chinese setup.
but the other numbers... i am 4 degrees retarded, correct? (yes i 
kow, i am WAAAAAAAAYYYYYYYYY more retarded than that. like 360).

poop.

i would be fine if i were advanced, but retarded is bad for what i;m 
doing. or is it? all the gofast boys sat advanceadvanceadvance, but i 
want torque and power.

if it IS retarded, i DO have a berg offset woodruff key, cut .01&quot; 
i am too stupid - or my magazine articles are too fuzzy on this - to 
figure out how many defrees adv / retard that gives.

bad news is that using this woodruff key means crank goes back to 
shop to put the gear BACK on with it. more delay and money.

i'm used to it now. kinda like when the 10,000 ant starts eating your 
eyes. you lose count after 5k or so.
