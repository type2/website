Subject: Re: [VB] RE. lil' pivoting window seal replacement

Hey - thanks for the tip - actually - I did it with dish soap on the floor
last night - went in quite easily.  I read David Mayes notes and saw how he
had put on pipe clamps to push the top and bottom down and he said that if
you have to do that its better to take them apart again and bend the frame
in a bit and redo em.  That's what I did and it worked great.  I just used a
couple of blocks of wood and a pipe clamp to push the glass in that last
little bit - worked fine.  I was pretty much stumped as to how to cut the
rubber under the swoosh but I'll try bending the exacto knife blade as you
suggest.  DAMN - these windows look nice - except for all that excess
rubber.

I pulled all my door frames apart and I'm replacing the Sigla glass with
Sekruit.  The glass is just so much nicer than my older glass with all of
the air bubbles and tiny cracks.  This Sekruit glass looks like it was cut
yesterday - the Sigla looks like it was cut 40 years ago and abused for
those last 40 years.

I'm even using the Sekuit latches.  Those Sigla style latches really didn't
slide with a damn but the Sekruit works great.

Thanks again for the tips.

&gt; After that release it all and trim the rubber.  The
&gt; toughest part is trimming it under the rain gutter.  I
&gt; took an exacto knife blade and heated up the tip so i
&gt; could bend the end 1/8&quot; 90 degrees.  I can then slid
&gt; in under the gutter and cut the rubber.
