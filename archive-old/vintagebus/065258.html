While I agree with the sentiment, the chrome isn't what will hurt you with
tin.  The tin simply ducts air around and doesn't have a significant role
in dissipating heat.  The vast majority of the heat is dissipated through
forced convection and leaves with the air out the bottom of the engine.

What _will_ hurt you is the low quality of some of the aftermarket tin,
whether it is chrome or black.  A while back I bought a set of cylinder
tins and then wondered why my cooling flaps didn't move.  turns out that
they didn't bother to put in the &quot;dimples&quot; needed to clear the actuating
levers as they moved.  they also tend to leave out some of the small, but
important air guides inside the tin.

For a long time, my rule has been to use only OEM tin, preferably German.
I'd rather spend a few hours cleaning and brazing to make sure that I
have tin made as Ferdinand intended.
