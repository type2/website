Subject: Test run of the old 67 bus...

I drove my bus up to Lincoln (40+ miles) to have it aligned this morning.
With a gusty tailwind, it was a real nice trip - plenty of power to move my
brick down the highway.  Olston's Import did a quick check of my alignment
and they found my camber was a bit negative on the left side but nothing to
be too terribly worried about.  The toe-in was off so they adjusted it and
now my bus handles better.  It doesn't do the quick darting from side to
side in the gusty winds like it once did although it's still nothing to brag
about.  I think the steering box is the only thing left that I need to
replace and that should really help because despite my efforts at adjusting
the box (just about as tight as I can go), the steering wheel still has 3
inches of play side to side and that is a lot when you drive a bus.

I rolled the speedometer over to all zero's so now I even have a new bus out
of the deal.

On the way home though, the southerly tailwind was now a southerly headwind
and I really made the ol' girl work.  I stopped to get fuel on the south
edge of Lincoln and I was off.  I drove the bus floored to maintain 65 until
I got to Cortland.  This was about  a 20 mile jog and still no temp light
came on from the Berg dispstick sending unit.  That was a vast improvement
from the corner crosswind I drove in last week in which I started running
hot with about a 15 mile drive.  This time I had a retimed, tuned up, and
deep sumped bus to try out.  After Cortland, I drove 45 in 3rd gear (freeway
flier trans remember) and drove this way for about 5 miles) and laid back
into her again and drove floored. This time I was close enough to home that
if I had a problem, I wouldn't be too away from help.  I started pulling
hills and booking down descents and hit 70 with the bus handling tons better
than it did previously.  When I got about 3.5 miles out of town, the old
temp light started coming on and so back to 3rd/45mph I went and I drove
that way until I got into town.  It's also hot out - it's well over 80 and
we're supposed to hit 100 today.

I think with the addition of the Porsche pulley, it will vastly help the
cooling.  I also think that for a 20,000 mile 1600DP, it's not performing
too terribly bad either.  I think my 1776 will have the Porsche pulley and
Berg sump moved over to it once I'm ready to install it in the bus.  This
along with the dual carbs and T4 oil cooler should go a long way to keeping
the engine cooled down.

So good so far...
