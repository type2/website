Guys....I think the owner of the bus in question has made it abundantly
clear that he doesn't want the raffle idea to be aired in this public
arena. You have two options as I see it.

1) Raffle your own bus. Do it anyway you want, but talk about it amongst
yourselves unless you're serious.
2) Buy the bus in question and raffle it off yourself. Said owner doesn't
need people muddying the waters regarding whether the bus is for sale or a
possible raffle candidate...to clarify this - the bus IS FOR SALE. It's a
great bus at a steal of a price. It's a chance to own a unique piece of VW
history. Heck, now it's a chance to own a piece of vintagebus list history too.

So, can we consider this &quot;raffle&quot; topic dead yet?

Thanks,

Scott
