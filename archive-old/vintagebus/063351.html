&gt;This is very interesting!  Anyone tried this before?

Never have.  As an observation, though, I have seen the distributor off
a Geo Metro (Suzuki) engine that had an offset drive dog, just like a VW
distributor.  I think it was either a Mitsubishi or Denso part.  The
distributor housing had a flange and two bolts for mounting, instead of
a round clamp like a VW, but the drive shaft looked the same.  I'll try
and check the next time I'm around that engine.

I think this idea of swapping distributors is interesting, but I don't
know if I personally would try it without either a spiffy timing light
with advance function, or a distributor machine.  I have to think that
the advance curve for a 2.2 L water-cooled Toyota engine is a little
different than the one for a 1.5 L air-cooled VW engine.

One &quot;improved ignition&quot; idea I have had is to run a stock VW distributor,
but with the plug wire towers in the cap drilled out and a Hall-effect
sensor installed in each one.  Have each sensor fire a coil - one
coil per cylinder.  I think the advantage here would be that at high
RPMs, you could run more dwell on each coil and get a bit better spark.
Haven't tried this though.
