&lt;&lt;What is best thing to use to remove orloosen up 35 years of build up of 
dirt and grease that has abundantly caked on? There layers after layers on 
the front end parts surrounding the wheels and also back wheels too.  &gt;&gt;

Hi Sunbuggy,
Take it to a wash rack, not one of those car wash places where it just gets 
towed through a wash system.  At a wash rack you handle a pressure washer 
sprayer wand, feed coins into the machine and you crawl around while cleaning 
your VW.  Set the washer to soap/engine degreaser, soak all the greasy, dirty 
suspension and wait at least five minutes to let the degreaser work in.  Then 
set the wash system to high pressure rinse feed it more coins and go at all 
the areas you degreased.  Best to wear grubby clothes cause you will end up 
wearing alot of the grease/dirt.  After doing this several times what you 
will have left is a cleaner VW, but probably will require the use of a slot 
tip screw driver to carefully scrape the thickest worst areas clean or at 
least cleaner before going back to the wash rack again to finish up these 
areas.  Eric&amp;Barb
