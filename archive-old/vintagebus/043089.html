Unlike the Bug back up lights...they are the same but without the chrome
rear back to them.
There are 2 small, threaded rectangular metal parts that secure the whole
assembly into the body sheet metal.  These are located on the backside of
the sheet metal.
Yes they are located below tail lights!  Thanks Thom.
later
