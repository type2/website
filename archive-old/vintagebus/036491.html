that repairable? How do I fix it? Can I go to a junkyard and get a new front?

Hi Gabriel,
If it is small it probably is repairable.  Though it depends on how small 
small is, and how deep.  You really need to worry about proper rolling 
suspension, steering, brakes, and seat belts first.  Then the engine, body 
work, upholstery, and body seals.   Eric&amp;Barb
