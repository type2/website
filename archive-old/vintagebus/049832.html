Subject: Re: [VB] Types of Busses

&gt;WRT the statement that a kombi is a panel with windows huh??

What does &quot;WRT&quot; mean?

Yes, a kombi IS a window van.  Rear seats were optional.  There were no
side panels or headliner in the rear.  Just an empty van with windows.



&gt;
&gt;So is a panel just a samba with less windows and no sunroof?

A panel van has smooth sides.  Different stampings than a kombi or a samba.



&gt;oh and just a couple other this and thats you know little stuff.

I don't understand this.  Grammar?
