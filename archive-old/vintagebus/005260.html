Hey, Steve, say hello to Saundra (sp?) and the kids.

&gt;work.  I believe the label says it's a plastic caulk but it sure looks and
&gt;smells like tar.  It cleans up with mineral spirits and never fully

This stuff was formerly known as &quot;Plastic Asbestos Roof Cement&quot; before
asbestos became persona non-grata.
In this instance, plastic refers to the classic definition of the term
describing the physical property of a material which is capable of being
shaped or molded readily into the desired shape. This has nothing to do with
the modern uses of the term to describe a polymeric material (i.e. Phenolic
or Polyethylene) which can be molded into desired shapes, or something which
is fake or unnatural  (Plastic, Fantastic Lover)
