&gt; I think that there may be a more serious problem.  I did a complete tune-up
&gt; including valve adjustment and guess what, a 30/31 PICT wouldn't idle
&gt; eather.
&gt; I have no clue at to the internals of the engine as I suscribe to the &quot;if it
&gt; runs, don't f**k with it&quot; school.  I've been running it for about 2yrs with
&gt; no problems.  All I've done to it is oil changes and tune-ups and it hasen't
&gt; ( until now ) let me down as a daily driver.
&gt; Oh, well, I guess it's time to really tear into it.

I have never heard of an idle problem being anything other than ignition
or intake. Usually intake.

Have you gotten out the starting fluid or propane and *really* checked
for intake leaks? Dont, by all means, please, dont tear down the motor
for an idle problem! I have a motor or two that really do need to be
torn down that I will trade for one with an idle problem.
