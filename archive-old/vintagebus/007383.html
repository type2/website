Gee - this is a no brainer.  With a listee trying to unload a fifty somthing
single cab with no bed and another listee has a bed, put 2 and 2 together.

I sit here in shock that no one wants this piece.  Once it's gone, it's
gone.  I'm glad Tom did choose ebay though because he stands a chance of
actually getting a little money for this rare hunk of metal and maybe just
maybe it'll go to a good home.  Tom, if lived a days drive from you, I'd be
there this weekend to pick it up.  Sorry you are having such a time
unloading it.
