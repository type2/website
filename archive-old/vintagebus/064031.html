Subject: Re: [VB] Listees' buses for sale?

&quot;New Bus&quot; is not coming out until 2005 so we can rule this out... but something else might be

| Couldn't help but notice that 2 Southwest listees just put their buses up
| for sale on the samba(including the owner of the samba).  Do they know
| something that the rest of us listees don't know???  Are their areas being
| occupied by the gov'mint to practice war games for Saddam??? or possibly
| they are selling in order to buy the newbus coming out?  Or they both know

| that I have been sniffing to much POR-15???
