Hi Terry,
I've not see very many buses with this colour combination so it was good to
hear from another.
I went through a few bus brochures I have and found one dated 1958 with
grgreen, so this would support your claim to 1958. It would be interesting
to see if any others come forward with earlier mango green/seagull grey
colours.
By the way, although it is an unusual colour I never cease to get
complements. The pastel shades are very representative of the late 50s early
60s.

&gt; glen, my 1959 standard microbus was mfg.  1-20-59 &amp; has this color
&gt; combo. so i quess the colors were introduced in late 1958 unless
&gt; someone else has any more info. thanks for the color codes though.

&gt;&gt; I have this on the tag in my 61. It is for codes L346 and
&gt;&gt; L347, or Seagull grey and Mango Green. I believe that this colour
&gt;&gt; combination was introduced in late 1959 and was used until mid 1961.
&gt; The
&gt;&gt; matching upholstery is Caramel Brown
&gt;&gt; There is a photo of  my van showing these colours at my Bad Camberg
