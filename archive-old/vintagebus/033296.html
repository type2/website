 I am trying to remove the brackets from the bumper

on my 67 kombi to weld them up a bit but the long

bolt that connects the upright bracket spins. There seems

to be no way of getting on the nut as it is behind a

peice of metal on the upright bracket. Do you have to cut

the bolt then get the bumper apart to get at the nut, or is

it supposed to be welded on the back side of the steel plate?

when disassembling bumpers I use a torch to heat up the nuts/bolts and then a
squirt bottle of wate rto cool, repeat  Shock treatment to break up the rust
and this helps prevent broken off or stripped bolts.   Broken off bolts in the
tubes are really a pain so I try to avoid them.  Half brak on me w/o the
torch, and so far none with.     Unfortunately...for you, too late so yes
there is a welded in nut in the upright the long bolt that spins on you is
stuck into.    My advice is to grind off the head of the bolt, remove the
pieces, with more room you can probly remove the bolt from the upright, tap
the inserted nut to a bigger size, and carry on.  Perhaps the welded bit on it
has broken free.  Perhaps it would be easier to find another upright.   Then
agaiin it may the the bolt that goes into the welded in nut on the other side
of the plate in the bumper.   Sometimes they break loose.   (you can feel for
this one)   In that case either grab the nut with vice grips and remove, or
again grind off the head, and put it back together with a nut and bolt.
Grease your hardware for reassembly.  (grease du jour)
