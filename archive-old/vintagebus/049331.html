Karl and I tried to do the above on a junkyard 66kombi-camper. Karl recently found a great junkyard engine on half-price day that was blowing ~135 compression after we fixed the PO botched generator installation, loose exhaust studs, missing &quot;dime&quot; in the carb, etc. It's a stock doghouse singleport from a '71 bus with the weird left heater duct. 
So it was time to pull the rod-knock dual port from the bus. I crawl under to put a socket on the upper left bolt that threads into the insert of the AH case engine. Can't get the socket on. Arms wrapped around the oily transmission. Karl tries and finds the tranny has the D-bolt hole with a hex head bolt jammed in it. So I pulled the doghouse tin to find out whether it still had the insert. Yup, and a nice 17mm nut behind that! Did they drill out the insert and put the nut on to pull the bolt? No, it was threaded in the insert. Bad-word-Bad-Word. We had to remove the left side heater box to get a wrench on the jammed in bolt head. Finally pulled the engine after hours of this in 100+ heat. Luckily we have a half barrel from the local brew-pub on tap and that the PO's whereabouts were unknown. 

Karl says he can get hex-head bolts that will fit in the D-bolt space, but he runs his two splits with 3 bolts. Anybody need 'em?

Maybe somebody knows this bus... bright blue pedal pan, red gas tank with the words &quot;Farfeg Mubin&quot; painted on it real nice. Has the dryest floors I've ever seen in an original bus. The floor board in the cargo area is original and nice. Under that is red primer/seal on perfect floors. See the pictures on www.vintagebus_dot_com, search with &quot;Houck AND 66&quot; , look for the dove blue camper. 

There was a piece of striped material that was nearly thrown away or used as a rag until I noticed the snaps. It fits below the cargo doors as part of a tent setup. Will take pics tonight and post, anybody need it? This may be a Riviera, the tag is missing.
