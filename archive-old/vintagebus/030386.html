Subject: Dr. Joe Nodzak -Thanks--

Dr. Joe Nodzak--A builder of VW roof racks--ladders--double bend shifters--Who could
always be counted on for a Donation to  any VW Club--Who knew VWs like no one else--and
one of my closest friends--Has left us--For some 21+ years, i spent hours in his shop
watching him do miracles by improvising in the fabricating of automotive anything--He had
a touch that i have yet to see in anyone else--i remember many years ago i had trouble
with the taillights on my Herbey--Could not get them to work --directional --but no
brakes--brakes but no directionals--So i took Herbey to see &quot;Dr. Joe&quot; as i always called
him--He took out the lens moved the wires into the same position that i did--and they
worked--I said &quot;Joe i did that with no luck--how come it worked for you&quot;?--Joe said --
&quot;Herbey just wanted to come and see me&quot;! I will miss him so much--i cannot put it into
words--But the Lord is getting one heck of a mechanic--thanks Joe--for showing me what a
friend really is--TWWM, uj
