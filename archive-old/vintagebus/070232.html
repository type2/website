Subject: RE: [VB] Mystery VIN

  I have seen partial vin numbers stamped in the bottoms of window frames in
BD's and have been told that the doors etc. also are stamped (Porsche 356
stamped the last 2 or 3 numbers of the vin on most removable parts). Is your
a early 56?

Maybe it was an asset/rental/fleet number if this was a commercial vehicle,
or a 
builders number if it was a camper? Maybe some states require it stamped in
that 
location. Just guessing. 




 -Harry in Fresno

&gt; While I was admiring my bus, a '56, I noticed for the first time that the
&gt; VIN is stamped on the driver's side B pillar just below the striker plate.
&gt; I had never noticed it before and I've never seen reference to the VIN in
&gt; this location.  Was this a VW thing or did a prior owner put it there?
&gt; There is paint in the number and I think it's OG but I'm not positive.
BTW,
&gt; this is not the same as the body number which is behind the seat.
&gt; 
&gt; Any thoughts?
