Subject: What a story...Found a few extra cylinders in my compartment!

Well I was having horrible gas mileage a week ago. Thought I fixed it in the 
carb by switching a few idle jets. Today I was leaving my local FLAPS. The 
engine started quietly backfireing and I was thinking &quot;Oh great, I guess 
I'll just limp it home and hopefully get there and figure out what's wrong.&quot; 
Then I stopped at a light and when I pulled away it hit me.

Praise God!

My engine suddenly had so much power and I wasn't sure why. The pedal had 
pep and spunk and I was pleased. I did not know what was going on but I 
thanked God for His sense of humor.

Anyway later I found that a cylinder head temp sensor that I thought was 
broken all this time was in fact working and now the temps of both sides are 
reading near the same. It only now reasons to say that I had something less 
than four cylinders firing for a week and a half now and suddenly I've got 
all four with guts to spare. I guess that could explain 13 mpg a week ago.

What a story. What a smile on my face :) :) :) :) :) :)

Scott
