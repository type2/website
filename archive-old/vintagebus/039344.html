The Berg five speed is expenisve!!!!!!

That said lets look at the five speed.
Berg does not like the idea of a tall 5th gear. Although these are designed 
for bugs so you will have a higher end I think then the but. But, Instead 
what he does is leave the final drive the same, and gives you more gears to 
get there. Makes sense, but leaves you without the benefit of the true 5th 
gear you are looking for.
Parts of a rabbit tranny can be blended into your tranny for a real 5th 
however.
At this point the irs conversion might make sense if you have something to 
push it with. Use a 1979 type to tranny and a bigger moter then a 1600 and 
you can cruise at 70 with a nice slow turning engine.

BTW what is the name of this list again?
HOT VWS or something like that?
