To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

&gt;I made a water trap myself for very little money and
&gt;it works great. What I did was buy some small PVC and
&gt;some elbow joints. 

Oh-oh--this can be scary.  You should never use PVC
for air lines, just copper or iron pipe. PVC can, at
some unknown time in the future, as it deteriorates
from exposure to oil vapors and varying pressures,
explode into bits of sharp shards of hard plastic.
Much better to use copper tubing even though it is a
bit harder to work with and more expensive.
My job involves working with these kinds of systems,
with professionals experienced in compressed air
systems.
