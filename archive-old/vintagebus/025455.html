&gt;2. A VW Bus is featured in the video. 

&gt;I know no examples... yet.  But these would be very interesting to know.

A couple of years ago I was working on my 66 kombi out in the street on a 
saturday, and I saw some new wave looking people 
down on the old train tracks across the street from where I live. They were 
being filmed walking around in the junk strewn lot, etc.
then one of them came up to me and said 'eh, we're doing a music video and we 
were wondering if we could set up our keyboards
in front of your bus. I complied and one thing led to another until Robbie? 
the lead guy was standing on my roofrack playing his 
guitar while my cat sat on the bed with the hatch open. The band was Modern 
English and the Video would have coincided
with whatever reunion album they did a couple of years ago. Never saw it 
because I don't have cable. supposedly it's out there
though.
