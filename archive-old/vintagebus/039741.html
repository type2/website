Hey y'all.
I got in after doing _another_ set of rear wheel bearings on the right side 
of the Burrito Express.  Some of you may recall that I did this after a road 
trip from Charleston to Martinsburg WV to St Augustine Fl and back to 
Charleston.  Bought a kit from bus Depot Ron.  Installed said kit according 
to the directions in Mr Bentley's tome.  I would expect to get more than 
24000 (twenty four thousand) miles from a set of wheel bearings.  The bad 
outer bearing had rollers about 1/8&quot; shorter than the made in the USA Timken 
I installed today.  The cage had partially failed, and the rollers had to be 
forcibly turned in order for them to remotely resemble what a bearing's 
supposed to do. This bearing failure also wasted a brake drum.  It was not a 
lack of grease that caused this bearing to fail.  It was, plain and simple, 
very poor quality parts.  Ths same parts he refers to in his 'buy quality 
parts' post of today.

Am I ranting?  Why yes, I believe I am.  It was a really nice day out, the 
first day off I've had in over a week, and I spent half of it repeating a 
process I should not have had to perform again for at_least 50,000 (fifty 
thousand) more miles.

Fortunately, I enjoy working on my bus and I got to see my friend Derek who 
happened to have a spare drum and the day off too.  I took pix and have 
written a basic page that really won't help you much more than Mr Bentley 
can.
