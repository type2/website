Subject: [VB] Undercoating?
Message-ID: &lt;0.4738d9df.25946f05_at_aol_dot_com&gt;

Id like to undercoat my '59 panel when it gets back from the bodyshop. It has 
a few very minimal spots of surface rust. Would you suggest POR-15 for this 
or should i just tackle it by sanding it all down and spraying it? I know I 
dont want to use rubber coating or anything else that may retain water and 
provoke rust.
Also, what color was the underside originally (primer?). I'm really 
interested in por-15 and am thinking of goin w/ this.

Merry Christmas,
Pete
