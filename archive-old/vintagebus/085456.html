Subject: Treasure Chest Door Prop Attaching Bolt

I need a little help!

I need a shoulder bolt that attaches the door prop to the treasure chest door
on my '63 SC. Certainly willing to pay any reasonable price.

If I was so inclined,I guess I could get one in the same manner I lost this
one. Two guys came to my house and expressed an interest in buying the SC. I
let them take it for a drive. When they came back, I got the usual &quot;I'll think
about it&quot;, and they left. The next time I had occasion to open the right
treasure chest, you can guess....no bolt.
