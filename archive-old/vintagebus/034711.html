After 8 or so weeks that guy can go jump in the lake for all I'd care.  If 
you're not happy with something you've received you have to let the seller 
know right away.

Also, why would he send the part he offered to trade and then 5 weeks later 
decide he wants it back?

That sounds like an Issaiah move
