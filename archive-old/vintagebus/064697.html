Subject: Re: [VB] Cylinder studs

hm, ya i think on  the sp  they are the same as the upper outers.  on the dp 
the two upper inners are shorter.   I'd take them out of a spare case.   In 
fact I have taken them out of a spare case, so my spare cases have less studs.

&lt;&lt; Hey y'all
 I'm converting a dual port longblock to single port.  I need the 4 inner 
 upper longer studs (8mm) for a single port.  Any of you vendors out there 
 have a set for sale separately or do I have to do the inevitable and buy a 
 complete set?  Contraiwise, aren't they the same length as the outers?
