Subject: RE: [VB] Proper side mirrors

Round would be stock, but the 'elephant ears' were popular dealer
options.

Go with what you like best!

Twas writ:
I have a 67 standard bus. I need to replace the side view mirrors. Which
ones are correct? Some list the &quot;elephant ear&quot; as correct, while others
list
the smaller round ones as correct.
Thanks for the advice!
