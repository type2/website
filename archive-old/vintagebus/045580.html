I have often wondered the same thing, my 59 has durvit for all 6 pop outs and 
sigla everywhere else. doesnt seem likely that all 6 pop outs would get 
replaced with durvit logoed pieces. I've only seen delog on windshields, 
never seen or heard of kinon,  and I've never seen duro on a bus, just on bug 
pop outs and the puck.

&lt;&lt;  I have wondered if VW used whatever glass was available or
 if certain glass was used on certain models/years.
 
 I have also noticed that VW used other glass manufacturers. The pop-out side
 window glass on my Dormobile is by Durvit, and the laminated and frosted
 pop-outs on my 67 ambulance are by Delog. South African buses feature
 locally made Armourfloat brand safety glass (side windows and early
 windscreens) and Safevue brand laminated (later and replacement
 windscreens).
 
 My 1965 factory &quot;Damage Numbers&quot; book lists the following glass suppliers:
 Delog, Durvit, Duro, Kinon, Sekurit, Sigla.
