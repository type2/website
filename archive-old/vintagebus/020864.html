Subject: Re: [VB] tire pressure



&gt; 
&gt; we REALLY need to figure this one out... this is a big-time safety
&gt; issue!! i recently purchased some bridgestone 603v tires for the 70,
&gt; load rating
&gt; 1750 per tire, pressure 65 psi.
&gt; i have been told by a few folk that the vw spec for radials is correct,
&gt; by 2 or 3 others that the tire factory pressure is correct, and MUST be
&gt; adhered to to prevent tire damage and/or wear.
&gt; the people who say to run lower pressure point to the lower weight of
&gt; the bus vs. suvs (the high weight of suvs is usually close to the rating
&gt; of the tire), and that tread wear might be affected. those who swear by
&gt; the factory rating affirm that running a heavily loaded tire when
&gt; underinflated will strain it and cause tread seperation... our busses
&gt; might not roll, but a blowout is no fun nonetheless.
&gt; 
&gt; all the &quot;i'm doing this&quot; and &quot;vw said that&quot; is useless - what it will
&gt; take is someone out there who talks to the tire manufacturers on a
&gt; regular basis what THEY would recommend... if bridgestone tells me to
&gt; run the 603v at 60 psi with a bus weight of say 5400 lbs, THAT IS THE
&gt; PSI TO RUN!!

Just to muddy the waters, you have to get two pressures, one for the front and one for the back axle.  You also have to get two different 
pressures for full load and 3/4 load conditions on the back axle.  How much of the time do you actually carry a ton of cargo in your bus?

&gt; what vw said is irrelevant: that was 30 years ago. the tires they were
&gt; referring to were passenger or light light truck tires with a different
&gt; manufacturing technology.

No.  They were referring to radial ply tires, just like the ones we are using now.  I agree that specs for bias ply tires aren't usable, but the 
radial tire specifications are fine.

The charts you refer to exist, but for some reason tire manufacturers hold them very close to the vest.  I've seen them at tire shops and 
there are a few on the web, but I haven't found anything for the 185R14 Load Range D tire.

I use the VW specifications and get good even tire wear.  When I tried a little shadetree engineering and increased the pressure, the tires 
wore out in the middle.  It's pretty obvious to me that VW knows what they are talking about here.
