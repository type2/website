Subject: Re: [VB] horn repair

do you have a spare battery or battery charger lying around?   It's okay to 
test a 6V horn on 12V.  In fact, I prefer a 6V horn on my 12V system as it 
makes people sit up and take notice.   Or you could use wires and your bus' 
battery.

Once when I was messing with horns and cleaning contacts the horn almost 
worked, but the halves needed spacing apart.  I made an extra gasket from 
....a paper grocery sack. Scissors and hole punch are useful.  I guess I 
could have turned the adjustment screw but I didn't notice that till later.   
I wouldn't use permatex. get some little screws/nuts.  Wear ear protection 
when adjusting horn tone?

 i put it back together with a couple spring clamps as i don't have a bunch
 of screws to put it together yet, and i wanted to test it. I then got a few
 double A batteries together, until I got about 6.3V. The I hooked it up ot
 the horn, and it is doing something...not sure exactly what, i am thinking i
 just need to adjust the screw some. it makes a thunking noise, and it
 appears as though the diaphragm just goes thunk against the coil.
 
 I checked the archives with some help there from Matt and Eric &amp; Barb. I
 guess the condenser gains then loses a charge, causing the contacts to open
 and close. but in its rest state-the contacts should be closed, right?
 
 some questions:
 since i mangled the gasket-could i just use some liquid gasket stuff, like
 permatex?
 does it makes sense to just put it together, and adjust the screw with it on
 the bus?
 seems like if it is making that thunk noise-it either needs to just be
 adjusted, or the double A batteries don't have enough juice to sutain a
 &quot;BEEP&quot;. does that sound right?
