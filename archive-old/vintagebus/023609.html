I have seen spare tire covers for walk through in the blue for the 66/67 
deluxes, and for the platinum 66/67 deluxes.   Extremely hard to find in 
original.   Doubt they were installed in ccommercials.

The walk-through front seating option was first offered in 1955 on the 
transporter as an  option. This put the spare tire storage in a recess in 
the engine compartment cover. In the pre-'68 busses did the spare tire ever 
come with any type of cover? What were the colors available for that cover?
