Leaking brake fluid on the left side? You have to go through it all, no
telling what the knuckle-draggers did to it.

Subject: [VB] bad brakes


I had tie rods replaced at a local shop and haven't really driven my bus
much since.  Then today I applied the brakes and my bus really pulled to the
right.

I don't really have time to look at it until next weekend when I'm planning
a tune up and oil change - but does anyone have any ideas as to why my bus
would pull to one side like that. I guess a brake adjustment is the first
thing to try but I thought I'd ask.

Thanks
