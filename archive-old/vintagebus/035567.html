Subject: Re:  [VB] Stuck front beam
To: thom_at_calweb_dot_com, vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com


The trailing arms on the front beam of my '54 don't move.  I remember
someone else having the same problem a while back, but I don't recall the
outcome.

How does one get it &quot;unstuck&quot;

Should I just toss this beam, go down to pick-n-pull and grab another?

well, I haven't seen many BD beams lying around recently, so probably better 
to work with what you got.  Unless you can get something.    Which is not 
neccessarily going to be in any better shape.

what have you done that tells you it doesn't move?    Also have you greased 
it till new clean grease comes one everywhere?   Are there rust holes in the 
beam? Veewee's idea of taking it apart and cleaning isn't bad.  Have you 
jacked up under a spindle and had the trailing arms not make the torsion 
leaves not give?   I recommen getting the bus running, piling a couple large 
friends into the front seat with you, and driving.    And giving it the 
grease reatment frequently till it comes out clean very quickly.    It is 
funny about that.  At one point I decided to grease the suspension of my 65 
every 3K mi tune up, and it wasn't for a few tuneups that it started coming 
out clean  before the grease I was just putting in went through.  cause the 
new grease I would put in each time would mush up with he old grease still 
stuck in there.  dilute dilute, work those old crustys out.   Do take apart 
the king/link pins though.  bds use the same link pins as the  buses through 
63 (to 1 144 xxx or whatever, unles M 216 or is it 215?) in case yours are 
fubky.  :)  but you be stuck on bd only for the king pins, so you might want 
to grab that BD beam out of the local pick and pull after all. grease is good 
grease is your friend your bus loves grease.   Roofing tar kicks booty too.
