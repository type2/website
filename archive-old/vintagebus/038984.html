Subject: Re: [VB] Metal brake line lengths?
Message-Id: &lt;CMM.0.90.4.945758264.lcs_at_defiant.mit_dot_edu&gt;

&gt; After a quick survey yesterday, I am extending the brake rebuild to the
&gt; metal lines as well as the rubber lines and cylinders (and shoes, etc.)  I
&gt; know I can pull and measure, but would prefer to get the old out and the
&gt; new in without leaving the system open for any length of time, thus...
&gt;
&gt; Has anyone measured up the lengths of the metal lines?  this bus is an
&gt; early '67 with a single circuit MC, so we are talking ?'64? to '66 here, I
&gt; think.  I know from reading Bob Hoovers' sermons that I need bubble flare
&gt; ends.

Not to mention you'll have a fresh memory of how the brake pipe is run
for when you bend the new one into place.

I've had good luck going in there with a builders' tape measure (the
retractable metal kind) and measuring along the brake pipes from point
to point -- don't forget to add the thickness of the frame members that
they go through.  Don't worry if you get an inch or two extra,
it can disappear into a large bend.

Just did this for my front-to-back rear brake pipe, which had a chunk of
new tubing spliced in with _compression_ _fittings_:  in the course of
looking for a replacement bit of tubing, I learned that compression
fittings can't really take the potentially 1200psi in brake lines and
must not be used.  Some lazy incompetent must not have felt like
replacing the whole 111&quot; run.  If you see these on your bus, replace the
line!  Only use pre-made brake lines with &quot;inverted flare&quot; ends, that
look like (not to scale):

                               +-----+ |\
       ========================|--///|=  &gt;
                               +-----+ |/

You'll probably have to get more than one piece of tubing for the long
front-to-back line, but you can get couplers to join two pieces.  Also, be
careful to measure where the coupler will land, be sure there's room for it.

BTW, the box section of the outrigger frame that goes to the jack point
can fill up with dirt, get wet, and rot out.  If this is happening on your
bus, make sure the dirt stays below the level of the brake pipe, or it
will corrode away the galvanized coating and rot out the brake pipe too!
