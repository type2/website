I believe it's time for a new election.

My man Brian has it down.  Never did I or anyone dispute value of the
Sermons, it was all about Hoover's manner of correspondence, essentially
bad word choice and self-righteousness.  To refer to your own writings as
&quot;Sermons&quot; is a little over the top.  To recommend a stranger to buy a
Toyota is a little presumptuous.  To refer to the people who ask you for
help as &quot;little kiddies&quot;  is just plain f*cked up.  The boy is silly....

hard-earned and well-deserved position as Elder and Adviser in this
(quite
