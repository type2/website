Subject: (friday) bug theft

i want to thank everyone who has sent me condolences and sympathies concerning the theft of my 1967 beetle from the octo show.  jp said that my beetle was best of the octo show, so great a vw that someone had to steal it.  that made me laugh.  anyway, i had convinced jon that we needed to take the beetle because i wanted to get home early enough from the show to get ready for work the next day; i argued that we should take a fast car to help in this cause.  of course i never even made it to work monday.

i started out as a beetle person.  i still feel as if i am primarily a beetle person.  i came by my single cab because i acknowledge that beetles can't haul stuff.  i love all of my volkswagens but the 1967 beetle was the one i considered the best.

i have had friends who've had their cars stolen and while i've felt really bad for them and have seen them suffer, i've not really understood how awful it feels until now.  i feel really bad, like a member of the family has been cut down for no good reason.

i keep having this fantasy that the criminals who stole my beetle are caught and the trial against them sets a new law precedent.  because of the attachment an enthusiast has for their vehicle, instead of being tried like car thieves they are tried like kidnappers.  people who steal cars to take the stereo or whatever are tried for bodily injury and people who steal a car and part it out are tried for manslaughter.  of course i get to end the trial by telling the thieves that i hope they get to be the bitches of the jailhouse and they look satisfyingly worried.

cheers,
