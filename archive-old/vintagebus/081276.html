Subject: Re: [VB] VIN location for '58 single cab

&gt; VIN 283242 vin on rubber lip like :
&gt; http://www.dropgates_dot_com/identity/archvin.jpg


I used this picture and can't see the number, however it may be covered with
paint and grease to the point it's unreadable.  I'll try and get at it with
a wire brush and try to uncover it.  Thanks for you help.  I was hoping
someone with a '58 single cab would chime in.

thanks
steve
