&gt;  Ok, My friend is (finally) getting his bus together but he has come
across
&gt;  some problem that we can not figure out.
&gt;  #1 It won't start everytime.It used to start everytime up until last
week,
&gt;  now starts about once every 20 tries. Didn't start at all today. Starter
&gt;  just clicks. Reads 12.5volts at the battery, we cleaned the terminals and
&gt;  the ground point. So we figure it is the starter (which is probably bad
but
&gt;  this isn't the problem) So we push start it so he can drive it home from
the
&gt;  paint guy's house. Check the voltage coming from the generator (at idle
it
&gt;  reads -10volts)He blames the negative reading on his voltmeter acting up.
&gt;  Runs fine so he drives it home (10 miles?) Doesn't make it home. It seems
&gt;  the generator isn't charging the battery, which is strange because last
week
&gt;  we drove it to a show (maybe 5 miles away at night with the lights on)
with
&gt;  no problems starting or driving. The PO had taken the bus apart for paint
&gt;  and labeled all the wires (some incorrectly) and after the show he was
&gt;  poking around and noticed the generator was wired backwards (so he
thought)
&gt;  so he switched them. Is it possible that the generator is now wired
&gt;  backwards and that is keeping it from charging? Would that affect the
&gt;  starter too?
&gt; ============
&gt; does the gen light on the dash come on?  In a nutshell, yes the battery
will
&gt; not charge if the wires on not hooked up properly.  So get a wiring
diagram
&gt; (look at vintagebus_dot_com for yours)and make sure everything is hooked up
&gt; properly.  also check your generator brushes
&gt; ..............................
&gt;  Q#2
&gt;  Passenger side taillight will not come on. Power is going to both
terminals,
&gt;  we assume the housing isn't grounding so he runs a wire to a good ground,
&gt;  still nothing. Bulb is good, put it in the other side to check. Am I
missing
&gt;  something, I've tried using some aluminum foil in the socket to make sure
it
&gt;  grounds, nothing. Lost on that one too. He wanted me to ask before we tow
it
&gt;  to Jeff's Bug Shop (he's pricey but he's been doing it for 30+ years)
&gt;  Thanks,
&gt;  Brian
&gt; =========
&gt; get out your test lamp.  turn headlight on halfway. open the engine lid.
Is
&gt; there power going to the right taillight- it should be the white/red
striped
&gt; wire at the taillight.
&gt;
&gt; if the wire gets power, but the bulb isnt getting it, take hold of the
wire
&gt; where it is puished on to the spade connector and wiggle it.   I have been
&gt; having the same problem with my 61, it is corrosion, and what I need to do
is
&gt; take the light bulb out, and clean (lights off) the little thingys that
&gt; contact the bulb from the light, and wher ethe bulb ground to the holder.
&gt;
&gt; if the wire doesn't get power, you check the fuse box.  blown fuse? check
&gt; your wiring diagram foir which fuse is the right rear taillight.   Check
&gt; power at both sides of the fuse with taillight on.  twirling the old fuses
&gt; can help, if there is corrosion building between the fuse and fusebox.
&gt; This happens often in buses that sit, especially in wet climates.  and in
&gt; bugs the fuse box is under the hood, I used to have to clean the fuse for
the
&gt; wipers every year, until I moved to washington where the rain is lighter
&gt;
&gt; See- you just trace the power to find where it stops, and generally just
use
&gt; some fine sandpaper to clean the connections.   using a small screwdriver,
&gt; and loosen and tightening the screwterminals will help the electrical
&gt; connections.  But every connection has to work for the bulb to come on
&gt; bright.
&gt;
&gt; Its not a bad idea to take some time and clean the electrical system from
on
&gt; end to another.  Including taking apart the horn button assembly, and
&gt; cleaning that.  I like a nice loud horn.  BRRRRAAAAPPPPP!  That and a
crusty
&gt; bus with stuff hanging off the edges of the roof rack the people driving
new
&gt; cars give you lots of space on the freeway.  They dont drive up your
&gt; tailpipe.  And let you merge (I use an assertive lane changing technique,
as
&gt; seen in caravan to New Brighton State Beach last weekend) when they see
your
&gt; bright lights.
