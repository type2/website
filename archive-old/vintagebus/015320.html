Clear plastic bag.  A long length of that flexible wire-ribbed rubber
heater hose stuff (long enough to get to a source of fresh air).  A
fan that you can attach the hose to.  Put bag over head.  Put loose
end of hose in bag.  Turn on fan.  Obviously, some sort of harness
will be needed to keep the hose in place.  The fan needs to be strong
enough to maintain positive pressure even when inhaling, but that's
not really all that much.

For an artistic touch, use a bag with the printed &quot;do not play with or
put over head&quot; warnings on it.
