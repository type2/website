Calm down Tiger.  The leaks will come soon enough.  I had the same juibilation
the first time I drove my '60 panel in the rain.  Wait for the seals to 
take a &quot;set&quot; and loosen up.  Oh, and watch for the rust to start at the
seams of the frames when the rainy season arrives.

&gt; it rained and my safari windows... didn't leak! I thought these were
&gt; supposed to leak. What gives? Should I cut the seals shorter? Or maybe take
&gt; them off altogether?
