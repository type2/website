Thanks for the suggestion.  Is it something I can do with the engine in the
van?  Do I need to remove the alt. from the engine?  If so, I hope it will
stay working for another couple of weeks until I get a day off.  Did I
mention that the van it's in is my only transportation?

&gt; Mechanically, it's fairly straight-forward.  Just be careful of the
&gt; internal wires going to the screw terminals.  The bearing is a press-
&gt; fit sort of thing.  The one thing *not* to do is toss the core into
&gt; the freezer to make it easier to get the bearing on.  I tried that
&gt; once.  It worked great, except that the varnish/insulation cracked and
&gt; stopped being an insulator.  Heat the bearing if you have to.  Or do
&gt; it right, and borrow time on a press.
