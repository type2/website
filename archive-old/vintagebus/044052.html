&gt; &gt; We just did this with my truck, a '59 single cab) to very good
&gt; &gt; effect. You DO want to use a protractor, though, and I can certainly
&gt; &gt; recommend the electronic ones as being quite effective. Take your time
&gt; &gt; and measure a lot and you'll do fine.
&gt; 
&gt; That's a lot of bux for a simple job!  I used a simple $1.00 plastic
&gt; protractor, a piece of thread and a nut for a plumb bob.  Worked just
&gt; fine and gave me 1/2 degree accuracy, which is better than the 40
&gt; arc-minute adjusting steps of the torsion bars.

I'm sure that would work fine. Our electronic one was borrowed. And
thanks for that 40minute spec. I couldn't remember it off hand.

&gt; My bit 'o advice:  Level the bus
&gt; front-to-rear before starting.  

Alternatively, if you have a pickup truck, you can use the bed as one
datum and subtract your arm measurements from it to get the final
results. I suppose you could do the same with any other bus, suing the
floor.

&gt; Have fun!

Definitely. It was so easy that I think we'll do the '69 Westy as well.
