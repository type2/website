I'd just like to point out one problem that will most likely happen as a
result of the kind of test suggested below...
The starter has a shaft whose end is supported in a starter bushing
located in the bell housing.  This support point locates the spinning
portion of the starters elec. motor centrally to the housing...keeping it
hung this way keeps it from grinding/rubbing the housing...or even working
at all.
Starter bushing wear will in of itself cause starter problems.
Just a bit more for you to think about.  Of course if you are using the
autostick starter, what I have just said does not ring true.
