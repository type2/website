Subject: Re: [VB] Bottom tin opinions - Revisited

Dan,
Another webmaster (who will remain nameless) and I were having an arguement
about how useless the lower tin was. I have never ever ran the lower engine
tin. 120 AZ temps, no overheating. I argued that it  just had to do with
the keeping an accurate temp for the thermostat (which i have never ran
either!=) and a guard for the puhsrod tubes.  I have heard its uses
referred to as a snow guard, a mud guard, a rock guard, channel just  to
transfer the heat to the back, or a place so the rats can nest once the VW
breaks down.
Check out this email i saved from a while back on the type2 list. I fully
agree.

&gt;I'll add my two cents. I have a degree in engineering while obtaining this
&gt;degree I have studied heat transfer. As most know there are three forms of
&gt;heat transfer. Radiant, conductive, and convective. All three of these are
&gt;carefully considered when building an engine especially convective when
&gt;dealing with an air cooled engine. In fact, in a finite element course we
&gt;studied a problem of a cooling fin, if I remember correctly we looked at
it
&gt;twice once without and once with a convection term on the boundary. Of
&gt;course there was a significant difference in total heat transfer when the
&gt;convection term was added. This leading to the point of this email. VW
calls
&gt;the lower tin a &quot;heat channel&quot;. I believe that this is due to the fact
that
&gt;the heat produced by these engines is channeled and kept contained within
&gt;defined parameters (i.e. within the tin). While the cylinder heads are
&gt;designed in such a way to rapidly dissipate heat it is not to say that the
&gt;engine core need be cooled as fast in fact. I would almost say that the
&gt;&quot;cooling tin&quot; is not &quot;cooling&quot; at all. It is assuring that the engine is
&gt;properly heated. By controlling the ambient air temperature within the
&gt;engine core (via the heat channels and cover plates) the convection effect
&gt;on the engine is controlled. The thermostat is within the controlled
ambient
&gt;air. When this ambient air is warm enough then the thermostat expands and
&gt;opens the channels for the cooling fan air outside air. Now cooler outside
&gt;air is actually keeping the engine at that thermostat temp. 85 degrees
&gt;centigrade. Take all this with a grain of salt. FYI we have lots of great
&gt;heat channels and cover plates if anyone needs any. Hee hee!

Subject: [VB] Bottom tin opinions - Fluid dynamics anyone?


Looking for opinions on the bottom tin...the pieces that attach to the case
and the heater boxes.  The local shop owners believe them to be gravel
guards to protect the push rod tubes from flying rocks.  Others think you
have to run EVERY piece of the tin in order for the complete system to
work.  I'm running the type 3 or &quot;Cool tin&quot; on the bottom of my cylinders.
I wanted the air exiting the bottom of the cylinders to blow across the oil
sump, theoretically cooling it (while stopped) so I made &quot;shorty&quot; bottom
tins.  basically cut them at the first case attachment screw tab.  Figured
that would be good enough to keep the gravel out.  Any other opinions on
this one?

-Dan
