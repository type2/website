Subject: Re: [VB] SOTO is Back, eh?

If this is really a problem, send one or two the clubs up here. Sure it's
cold on the Great Plains of Canada in the winter, and the beer takes some
getting used to, but on the upside traffic is way minimal..........

&gt;
&gt; I'm seeing rumblings on the 'net that SOTO is back.
&gt; Is it relevant?  How many bus clubs can SoCal support?
&gt; OCTO, NEATO, SV2 (aren't they in SoCal?).   It seemed
&gt; to me to be that OCTO was the be-all/end-all, with
&gt; the backing of the biggest names in da bidness.
&gt;
&gt; If you have (let's say) 5 bus clubs, and everyone in
&gt; a given geographic area is in each of the clubs, do
&gt; you really have 5 clubs?
&gt;
&gt; If a bus A leaves Seattle travelling at 105kph, and
&gt; bus B leaves Lake Havasu travelling at 120kph...
&gt;
&gt; Ramblings of a sleepy systems administrator...
