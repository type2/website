I was attempting to mix the 3 to 1 STP to grease and no luck finding the =
STP transmission treatment here in Kingston.  There is an STP engine =
treatment that is about the consistency of grease but that can't be =
right.  I did find this stuff that was a transmission additive called =
moly.... something.  It was in a toothpaste shape tube - except wider. =
Anyone think that stuff would work?  Or should I just keep a huntin' for =
the STP transmission additive?
