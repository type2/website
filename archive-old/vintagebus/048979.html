I found the can of PPG Silver White paint last night.  PPG even calls theirs Silver White, which was nice of them.  I know whith Light Grey, L345, PPG calls it Pale Grey.

O.K., the PPG number is DCC8251.  This is the PPG Concept paint, acrylic Urethane.  There is no recipe or formula on the can itself.

Hope this helps.

Robert
