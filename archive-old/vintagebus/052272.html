Subject: Re: [VB] What ever happened to the five hundred dollar bus?

I still think there are &quot;lots&quot; of the &quot;I'm going to restore this bus some
day&quot; well hidden in the garages and basements of the world.

I know of three such early split busses now, of course each owner has my
name and number &quot;if&quot; he ever decides to part with it so it can be my
&quot;someday&quot;  bus!

That's where the real treasures are in my opinion, but just like the VW
whores the price is usually up there as most of the busses are typically one
owners!


Back to lurk mode:-)
