&gt;Just a quick question...does anyone know the website for the metal 
&gt;wiz?..

check out the metwiz web site at     www.metwiz.bizland_dot_com
or try this link  &lt;A HREF=&quot;http://members.aol_dot_com/METwiz2/page1.html&quot;&gt;METwiz2'
s Home Page&lt;/A&gt;

For anyone that is interested, my '58 15 window deluxe restoration is 
pictured on page 2 and 3.  I suspect that my 58 deluxe will be coming home in 
June shortly after I return from the OCTO show.   
I am very pleased with the quality of work and can not say enough good things 
about Kelly as a person or a &quot;metal wizard&quot;.  He really pays attention to 
what his clients want in a restoration.  He also can fabricate damn near 
anything.  Tired of the short cargo side rockers being too short?  He can 
make them the correct size and out of nicer metal then any currently on the 
market.  He also makes the sought after safari window securing plates for 
those of you who want to install your safari's the factory way.
