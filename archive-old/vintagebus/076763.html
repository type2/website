Subject: Re: [VB] z bed questions

I find the bay window Z beds are MUCH MUCH MUCH more comfy.  the ones with 
the buildt in reinforcement that hangs over the engine area that were screwed 
into welded on nuts in  orginal installations but work fine without them in my 
'61 15 window.      The bed in my 61 is really nice.   Igot it out of a 
junkyard bay forget what year but the kick ass part is it was *free* as that junkyard 
is into cruching stuff and they wanted it gone.  :)

the springs in ths original Z bed in my 65 westy... wierd, and the other part 
doesn't have springs... so I sleep partly on springs and partly on foam, and 
that isn't so nice.   I want to get a later Z bed and change the wood and seat 
covers over... so I can use the later mechanism but have it look like 
original.   but be more comfy.I think they are the same width.   I could measure to 
make sure

Hi list -

    I have a z bed in my 64 bus that is from 70' or so bus.  I am going to 
buy a camper kit from a 67' walk through and am wondering if the z-bed from th 
67' is the same dimensions.  The 67 is a westy walk-thorugh ( but that doesn't 
matter right?)  I just don't want two z bed if I don't need them
