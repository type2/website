ok here is a stupid question, although there really are no stupid queations 
when it comes to a vw.  Can you explain the order of installation of the 
fulcrums axles and thrust washers to me?  Just triple checking so as i take 
it back apart ill know if i spaced out and screwed things up.  The nose cone 
is the 67 bus one i should have and someone suggested locking it in 2 gears.  
How is that achieved?  I doubt that its a bad tranny but ya never know.  And 
if you dont know already where I got this tranny I would rather not say until 
I figure this out so I dont have people questioning their ability and then 
have it end up my fault, that wouldnt be fair.  Just some questions from a 
tranny newbie.
