&gt; How many total cooling tin pieces are there on a 1600 SP motor?
&gt; 
&gt; My motor came with only a fan shroud the cylinder cover plates and the
&gt; plate below/around the crank pully.  Can anyone help me out and
&gt; list/name all the parts (including the thermostat) that I will need to
&gt; put my motor back in service.  Thanks!

Since it's a single port, I'm assuming non-doghouse here.

Let's see, there's (arranged by subassemblies)

Fan shroud (with fan, etc.)
  Left air flaps assembly
  Right air flaps assembly
  Connecting link
  return spring (very important!)

Right Cylinder cover
  Right lower air duct (2 pieces, attaches to front of right cyl. cover)
  Right rear air duct (attaches to rear of right cylinder cover)

Left cylinder cover
  Left lower air duct (attaches to front of left cyl. cover)
  Left rear air duct (attaches to rear of left cylinder cover)

Pulley lower cover
  Pulley upper cover (usually missing, and not needed for sealing)

Front cover (seals to body in front)

Rear cover (seals to body in rear)
  Intake air preheat duct (goes through rear cover)
  Left Preheat pipe cover plate 
  Right Preheat pipe cover plate

Thermostat bracket
  Thermostat

Left deflector plate (between cylinders and pushrods)
Right deflector plate (between cylinders and pushrods)

-------

That makes 22 parts that I can think of.  I've probably missed a
couple that others will fill in for me!

Of course, there are a number of rubber grommets and seals that close
up all the little gaps and holes in the tin.  Basically, if there's a
gap there should be a piece of rubber to fill it.

Happy Tin Hunting!
