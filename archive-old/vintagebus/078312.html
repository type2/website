Right.  I just wanted to do the math and see what the worst-case fuel
usage would be, which isn't that bad IMHO.

&gt;The Southwinds put out 20,000 BTU and burn .3 gallons per hour, but
&gt;that is running one wide open with no cycle time.

Just as a comparison, the gas furnace in my house is rated at
100,000 BTU/hr &quot;input&quot; (not quite sure what &quot;input&quot; means) and has to
heat around 14,400 ft^3 (408 m^3), or about 245 BTU/hr per m^3.  A Bus
has an interior volume of around 6.5 m^3, so the 15,000-20,000 BTU/hr
heaters are putting out something like 2300 to 3100 BTU/hr per m^3 -
around ten times as much as the house furnace.  OTOH, my house doesn't
often travel at 60 MPH with leaky gaskets.  :)
