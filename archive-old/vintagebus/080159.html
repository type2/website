Subject: Re: [VB] Camper bus.

This is a singlecab camper conversion made by Perris Valley Campers of 
Perris, CA.  Pretty neat.  I saved 10 pictures of it taken at some 
nameless VW show, when someone posted them on the Web back in Sept 2001. 
  Sent a bunch of them to David Eccles or whoever was advertising 
recently that he was writing a book on VW campers.  My pictures clearly 
show the 66-67 air vents in the rear.

It would be nice to find out more about these campers, if anyone knew 
the owners.  David would like more info, too.
