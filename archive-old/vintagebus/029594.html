Subject: Won't start warm.

Hi everybody,

I have a problem that I've been watching for someone else to have for
quite a while.  It hasn't been a problem until now.  The truck is in the
shop and I need to drive my bus.  My '61 westy has a starting problem.
When it is hot or even warm, it struggles to turn over as if the Battery
is dead.  Cold it fires up and the engine turns over with out a problem
and when running, it runs great.  I looked through the archives and
found a couple things involving wiring, the starter, the alternator.

To alleviate the problem, here's what I've done.  Replaced the starter,
and the alternator, with brand new bosch.  Replaced the positive battery
cable from the battery to the starter.  Taken the battery out of my
truck and tried that, with no difference.  Hooked up a jumper pack
(portable jumper battery pack), no difference. Pulled the motor, and
checked the end play (a suggestion from the archives), and removed one
of the shims as it was a little tight.

Forgive me, as I'm not looking at it now, but each wire in the circuit
was jumpered, and the one from the fuse box to the (? lights switch ?)
was replaced.

I ran into Jay Wallace (from the list and SV2's) a while back in a FLAPS
and he mentioned that it might be that my rings are too tight.  As he
was on his way out, I didn't want to bother him with a further
description of my problem as I thought I could figure it out, but alas,
I'm not.  ;-)   But now I need to drive my bus for a couple of days
holes in the roof and all.  Once I get my truck back, I can put it back
in the garage and finish replacing the rusty roof parts.

Thanks for the help.
Aaron
