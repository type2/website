Hi Curt,

&lt;&lt; I need to re-tourque the heads on a motor and I've heard different things.
One POV is the common sense one that you should do all the bolts, the other is
that it's just the ones under the rockers that loosen up.  Any documented
correct procedures out there?&gt;&gt;
For the first retorque at 300 miles from rebuild or brand new do the lower
four on each head.  We then like to pull the engine at somewhere between
30,000-50,000 miles.  When other maintance is needed, remove the upper cooling
tin and torque the engine case studs and bolts then all of the head nuts.
1963 VW bus shop manual states that when doing head work on the used VW engine
it is a good idea to retorque all of the engine studs/bolts not just the
heads.   
 
 &lt;&lt;My plan is to pull the motor and do them all, but I'm pressed for time and
I don't want to open up Pandora's box, so to speak.  &gt;&gt;
Do yourself a favor and take it out.  If you run into trouble it was just
going to show up later when and in less favorable circumstances.   Eric &amp; Barb
