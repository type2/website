You can use that wire to switch the ground side of a fused new style  Hella
relay located in the engiine bay.That way you keep all high current in the
rear of the bus.This is the way VW did it in the vehicles that came with
stock heated back glass.In my split bus parts fiche it lists a heated back
glass setup,can't rember if it lists both 6 and 12v though.

&gt; Hey all. Can anyone tell me what the extra wire leading all the way back
&gt; along the roof line and down out near the rear hatch hooks up to. This
&gt; is for a 58 Deluxe. Is it for a heated rear window? It is a factory wire
&gt; and I have seen them on other buses but was just curious cause I've
&gt; never seen it hooked up. Also there is no mount for an extra dome light
&gt; so I figured it wasn't for that.
&gt; Thanks
wow! that just gave me a great idea. in theory, you could take a heated rear
window out of a baywindow to replace the 63-67 rear window, couldn't you? i
could even use my havard switch that doesn't work. and it wouldn't even be a
hack job!

just a random thought that i thought i'd share.
