Subject: Replacing engine 1500 -&gt; 1600
Date: Tue, 19 Sep 2000 15:27:17 +0200

Hello

I'm wondering about changing my T2 1500 ccm (44hp) with a T1 1600 ccm
(According to owner running and pulling good, and it should have around 54
hp and it's a 1303S from around 73/74)

I want to change to get a little more power to pull a caravan and to get a
march speed on 110 km/h

What should I be aware of ?
What about the engine seal ?
It must be a 12 V is't ?
Wich carburator sits on it ?

Or where on the net can I get some engine specification ?

Ciao
 Lars
