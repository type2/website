Ya know, I am gonna incurr such a wrath for saying this, but *nothing* on a
bus should cost that much (save for engine, paint or body work).  I've been
writing an article on my beef with eBay...how it's artificially inflated
the prices on the used parts market, but I realise now that you don't
always need eBay to get outrageous prices.  Before anyone starts, I'm not
trying to pick on tds here.  I've seen these senseless price blowups
before.  I know this is going to start such a loooong thread (and I better
check email from school today) but if company X is selling safaris for,
say, $300, then what about original safaris makes them worth the extra
$100-300?  I'm not saying people don't have a right to try to get what they
can for parts, I just want to understand the logic behind it.
