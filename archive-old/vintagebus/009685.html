I really enjoy the &quot;bus quotes&quot; thread, I've been saving a few to pass along
to the list.
Colleague at the office: &quot;Where do you park all these?&quot;
Guy crossing the street: &quot;Love your bus, man.&quot;
Guy at gas station: &quot;Is that your VW? Man, that brings back some memories.&quot;
Woman at DMV who issued my title: &quot;A VW bus? One of my girlfriends in the
dorm had one of those,wow, the things we did in that.&quot;
&gt;From my wife: &quot;You think we're actually going to camp in that thing?&quot;
Editor in my office: &quot;Boy, if this bus could talk, imagine all the sex
that's gone on in here.&quot;
&gt;From my next door neighbor: &quot;You better look for more hash pipes in here
before the cops do.&quot; (good advice, I found two...both empty).
&gt;From my 15 yr old son: &quot;Duuuuuuuuuuuuuuude.&quot;
&gt;From two college girls at an intersection: &quot;Hey, that bus is sooooo
coooool.&quot;
&gt;From my 15 yr old son in the passenger seat: &quot;DUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUDE!!!!.&quot;
