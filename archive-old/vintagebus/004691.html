&gt; Got a funky problem with the Binz.  Most of the time the front brakes are
&gt; fine.  However, some times they pull hard to the left, and some time they
&gt; pull hard to the right.  I can't figure it out.  Any ideas?
&gt;

I have experienced similar behavior when small amounts of grease would
escape from the brake drum. Bad seals or sealing surface will cause this.
Check the back of the wheels for telltale signs.
