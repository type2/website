Hi. 

This small pop-top you have found is a correct original bubble westy
piece.  In Europe and Canada this small square pop-top was an option
available `68-`79!!!! In fact a friend in Germany has a `77 Westy with
this small pop top..... and to top that a factory `77 westy wood-slat
rack...yes!! they did make woodsalt racks thru `79!!! again only
available in Germany and Canada....according to Westfalia 90% of westy
production came to the USA so you can see how scarce these NON-US
options were.  I did have a couple brochures from Germany that showed
this top and the woodslat rack...sold them a while back....forgot who
bought them..anyone out there??

Please note; this later square pop-top is NOT the same as the split
style though...it is longer and the curve for the roof is different.
Also, the wood slat rack is obviuosly different....looks like a `65-`67
westy rack but reallllly squaty, very very close to the roof, but
parallel not on a slant like the very early westy racks ...some day I
will get these pics and info posted to the web...

&gt; While I was at my local pull and destroy yard  ran across a bay bus with a
&gt; split pop top. Looked to be a 68, did VW offer this as an option for early 68
&gt; or is this some kind o home brew. Inquiring minds what to know
