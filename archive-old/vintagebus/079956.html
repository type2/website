Subject: Re: [VB] Jerome Bus Raffle&gt; photos now uploaded.

As promised TONS of photos uploaded to the http://thesamba_dot_com/vw gallery
section. If you want to filter only for Jerome pix use key word:
[ AZ Bus Club - Jerome 2004 ] without the brackets. or go directly to the Club
Photos section. Start at the bottom of the page and work your way up to get the
progression...

As far as the validity of the number drawing goes, I was on stage blastin' the
camera and was right &quot;eagle eyed&quot; on it. I had $40. worth of 933xxx (933218-&gt;
933298) tickets and was in the mix up until the 4th digit was read... BOTH
times. =)

And don't think that we didn't do the math on the way home! ;-o!!!! &quot;Now if
we'd ONLY bought $X.xx more then...&quot; &lt;kidding&gt;

Let me say that it was one of the more enjoyable Jeromes that I have been to.
(inside joke) Thanks to Beto for the extra mechanical assistence. Maybe- I'll
have a bus back running for next year. I'll drive the Passat again and be able
to at least *claim* ownership of a running bus. =)
See you all at OCTO or Pomona?
