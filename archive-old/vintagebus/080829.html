&gt; Hi Tommy,
&gt; No.  That spacer is sealed on its outside by the axle seal and the innerside

ah ha!

I think I might have assembled it wrong then.

The spacer goes on before the bearing cover, does it?  Well, that makes 
sense and I'm glad I asked (it wasn't clear (to me) from the schematic).  

Just for a reality check:

does the spacer go on with the wide end on the tranny side or the wheel 
size?


Clara:  the spacer is the silver &quot;plug&quot; looking thing that's 
basically a cylinder that goes around the axle and that has one side 
that's bigger than the other.  Like a &quot;_| |_&quot;
