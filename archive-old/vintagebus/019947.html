&gt; crank nuts.  True/False?  If true, what is the difference?

I've seen a smaller version of the nut, which was downright tiny,
and I assumed it went to a real early bug.  The cranks are differnet -
bug cranks are longer.

&gt; And why would Things have crank nuts?  Wouldn't they have 1600cc engines?

I think it was just the army-spec things that had crank-start.  Put on your
military thinking cap for a sec - a hand-crank setup is a cheep way to boost
the overall reliability of the car.  And yes, you *can* crank-start a 
1600 - I used to do it all the time in my '56, sometimes for show, sometimes
under duress.
