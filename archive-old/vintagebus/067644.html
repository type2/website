Subject: Re: [VB] Old Volks.

I noticed some issues last night while trying to show my wife pics of Kyle's and VWHoward's thong =)

My guess is that his server is being updated or is down for the moment.

I sure as hell hope Ronnie didn't go anywhere.

&gt; Hi,
&gt; 
&gt; I could not log onto oldvolks_dot_com or type2parts_dot_com. Is Ronnie still out
&gt; there? Maybe his server is just off line.
&gt; 
&gt; Anyone know?
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks,
&gt; Chris
