&gt; Hey Eric,
&gt; 
&gt; I don't know where you're at, but in GA (and probably others) you just get a
&gt; bill of sale if the vehicle is over 10yrs old.  The PO of my bus just gave
&gt; me a piece of paper stating he was selling it and for what amount and dated
&gt; and we both signed it.

Do yourself a favor and put a LOW amount on the bill of sale.  Here in
CA your fees are calculated on the sale amount!!
