&gt; counterweighted crank and get all parts balanced, crank, rods,
flywheel,
&gt; pressure plate, fan pulley and pistons.   You may have power and
&gt; overheating problems running a bus at less than 4000rpm going 65 mph!
&gt; My '66 1500 westy with 4:375 rear gets better mpg than my '67 1600 bus

&gt; with a 4:12 rear.     Gary Gibson

actually, best cooling rpms is between 26-2800, according to pretty much 
everyone I have communicated wit who has guages in their buses.  Even if it 
has not been tached, it wil running cooler at 60 than 70, and cooler at 50 
than 60.  driving 50-55 in my 65 which has 3.88/1.26 trans w/1600 w/typeIV 
doghouse got 29 mpg at about 26-2700rpm, and ran cool in the AZ desert 
Phoenix toTucson carazvan  in the spring with slow buses (2 barndoors 
included)     AT 65 mph it is about 3200 pms, and ran warmer.   70 was 3500 
rpms and runs warmer.      Below 2500 rpms (50) the temp climbs from what it 
runs at 26/2700.     I did have power problems with the 1600 in a tall geared 
westy laden down with the camper kit, my stuff for a long road trip, and 
stuff I accumulated piled on the roof rack creating wind resistance.      I 
think for a 3.88/1.26 geared bus one should have a fatter motor.  I am 
planning on building a 1688sp actually.    this bus gets average of 23mpg 
road tripping, 20 around town.

 My 53 it runs cooler at 40-45 than 50-55.   With 36hp motor, dif cooling 
system than is in my 65.   top recommended speed is about 49 mph at 3700 
rpms, I haven't put a tach on it, but it does run cooler below that 3700 
rpms.   Though it would run at 4K + easily  without protesting, I would like 
to avoid rebuilding the motor again.


   This is the same  sort of situation that i have seen and been told of in 
buses with  various combination of gears and motors, that it is coolest about 
26-2800rpms, whatever speed that is. 

however, the 59 bus I used to have had little nuts and a split case tranny 
and I'd drive it 60mph (overrev? probably 4800 rpms) with a 1500 motor  with 
28pict carb and get 31 mpg- ignorance is bliss.  no guages of course, didn't 
get hot around town, only problems with heat I noticed were on a road trip in 
the midwest whe it was really cooking out and so we slowed down .
