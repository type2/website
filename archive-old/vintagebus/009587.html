Markus asked:

So the question:  What is the easiest way to lower the compression?


Install shims under the cylinders and/or semi-hemi cut the heads

We have no machine shops worth the title in Canada.


Then Shims are the only option.

Markus,
Take a compression reading.  Check against the following.
Also check out the Hoover Sermons as there is some very good information on
setting up compression properly.

This is a listing of what compression readings kind of correspond to what
kind of compression.  I usually set my engines up at about 7:1 CR and
usually get around 115 psi at  7000ft.  You can see that you can't find your
exact CR by this method, but can find at least a range it will fall in.

Based on the Bosch Tech Book Formula, a range of observed compression
readings can result from any given compression ratio.  The range results
from differences in atmospheric pressure and temperature.

    C/R            Range (in lbs)

    6.0            86-101
    6.2            90-106
    6.4            94-111
    6.5            98-116
    6.8            102-121
    7.0            106-126
    7.2            109-131
    7.4            113-136
    7.6            117-142
    7.8            121-147
    8.0            125-152
    8.2            129-157
    8.4            133-162
    8.6            137-168
    8.8            141-173
    9.0            145-178
