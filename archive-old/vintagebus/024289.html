&gt; &gt; Does anyone know of a good 6- or 8-ply siodewall rated tire in a *15*
&gt; &gt; inch?  
&gt; 
&gt; Well, here's a 195/70R15 load range D tire.  See:

I just shot off an email asking about these allusive 15&quot; 8-ply sidewall
tires. I will post results to the list. Thanks George for the tip! I had
all but given up and was prepared to run my 14&quot; rims on the mexico trip.
