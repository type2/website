&gt; hmm... what is in dielectric grease anyway?

Well, to us physics geeks, a dielectric is something you put between the
plates of a capacitor to increase the capacitance.  By definition it has
to be an insulator.

    I thought it had something to
&gt; help conduct electricity.

Nope, insulator.

  Does vaseline work just as well?   It's cheaper and
&gt; I have some in the tool box anyway for greasing distributor cams.

I don't see why not.  the only function of the grease is to keep air out
of the connection so it won't corrode.  I use distributor point grease
myself, since I have a tube of it in the toolbox and it's nice and stiff.
