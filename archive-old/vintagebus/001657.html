Hi all
 I am running a 1600dp in my 67 and have a big flat spot off idle.  I am
guessing it is lack of advance.  The port for the advance has a restrictor
in it, and this restrictor severely limits the vacuum to the advance.  What
is the reason for this restrictor? Can I remove it to get full vacuum to run
the advance can?

Thanks!!
