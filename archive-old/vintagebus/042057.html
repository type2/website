&gt; Thanks all for giving me your various opinions.  Quite a few of them out 
&gt; there!  Wish there were a few guys actually from Japan on the board, so I 
&gt; could hear their side of it too, however.

Since the cost of running an antique vehicle in Japan is astronomical, the
buyers of such vehicles are seldom involved in the actual restoration of
the vehicle.  You're dealing more with the Pebble Beach Concourse croud
than with the Pomona Swap Meet crowd.  They're more likely to be tracking
their stocks on the web than reading tech stuff about buses on the lists.
