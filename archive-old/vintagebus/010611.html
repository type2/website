Subject: RE: [VB] US camper kit /Weber carb ???s

Sounds like the Riviera window alright.....I have seen a couple of original Sundials with the red vinyl interior, and an EZ with the red vinyl.  The brass pulls and hinges sounds like the ones in my EZ and some Sundials.  The bed setup sounds just like my EZ bed and a Sundial bed I had.  They were identical. 
 Take a look on the bottom cushion on the z-bed. My z-bed in the EZ has an old yellowed piece of paper stapled to the bottom.  Beleive it says EZ Camper, and a patent number.  It's about the size of business card.


Hope that helps,  and see y'all in Jerome...leaving Weds mornin'.

&gt;    Sounds like an ASI/Riviera converstion. ASI is in Washington state. The
&gt; interior you discribed sounds like one out of a Bay ASI I parted out, except
&gt; the long window.

&gt; snip... &gt; 
&gt;.... other question- this 67 camper (with the pseudo W carb)  has a camper kit 
&gt; with red vinyl red piping covering the camper cushions, the long window on 
&gt; the drivers side- with a movable piece in front and back, center pane fixed.
&gt; 
&gt; twwod (mahogany?) with brassey handles/hinges.  table top ugly yellowy 
&gt; squiggly patterned formica.   Had a cooler unit which PO left somewhere,
&gt; same 
&gt; set up as a westy so 42 pretty much.  Is that the Sundial?  Riviera?  I
&gt; never 
&gt; can keep it straight.  to pull the bed out you pull straight back.  you can 
&gt; not flip the bottom of the seat up to get at stuff stored in there- you have
&gt; 
&gt; to open the cabinet door, meaning you cant leave stuff in the way.  Know
&gt; what 
&gt; I mean?  I can't get to the samba gallery right now to look at pics-  ya I 
&gt; just bought this thing god know why, from a lady who says she bought it from
&gt; 
&gt; the OO.  But she is somewhat vague on details, bus sat since 94, it has been
&gt; 
&gt; a while.
