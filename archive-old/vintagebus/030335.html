Subject: BBB V &amp; Chris Lee-THANKS!

The BBB V was a great success as everyone knew it would be==A special thanks to the LBB
including Ronnie--John--and Jim--They were a blur of constant working on the show--
The story on Chris Lee--She is a handicap lady that drives her bus some 140+ round trip
just to go to the Arizona Bus Club meeting.
Some weeks ago while driving her Faithful VW bus to a camping weekend another driver blew
a stop sign--Chris had her leg broken and a shattered knee--and a very nasty gash on her
face. Having the spare tire on the front of her bus may have saved her life..It will be
sometime before she will be able to drive--Her bus is totaled--We have been raising money
to help Chris. Two VW clubs in Phoenix--ABC and HO have already stepped up.
The BBB V were kind enough to allow Magoo and i some time to raise money at their show--
The generosity of Everyone is over whelming--JP  aka  &quot;Front Page&quot;   and VTO must be
congratulated on their donations--and everyone else there.  Chris at this time is not  &quot;On
Line&quot;  hopefully we can help her there as well--We have located a 1971 bus in
Phoenix--Chris can save the motor and tranny from her totaled bus--Now we are trying to
put the bus together--so far it needs the two front seats and a front bumper--With the
donations from the raffles and auctions we now have the funds--Bless all of you out
there.--I know i must have missed some special thank you's--I including the sweetie that
bid $56.00 on the limited edition special BBB V license plate at the BBB V show--VW people
really take care of their own----As a side note, Chris did make a BBB show a few years
ago--And when something was needed to use as a club to break the Pinata for the
kids--Chris stepped up and offered her crutch--
Again from TWWM and my partner Magoo and Chris---Bless all of you--Nice to know we are VW
Family--uj
