Not that I'm proposing this seriously, but I've seen at least two
non-street-legal-anymore-by-a-long-shot splitties with those red plastic
tanks used on outboard boats.  One was in a white with red polka dots
65 bus on bridgeless Dog Island, FL.  The tank sat on the luggage tray and
a hose ran down to the fuel pump.  Of course, this same vehicle's
accelerator cable consisted of fishing line run underneath the frame.
Ignition key was a screwdriver -- and naturally, it started every time and
ran perfectly, despite sitting outside on a barrier island year round.

(Dog Island residents use a WWII LST to ship cars out to the island; most
look like something out of Road Warrior and a large number are busses.)
