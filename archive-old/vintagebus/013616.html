My purpose for raising this issue is multifold.
Firstly, it's Friday and the VanBondo of old was a
provocateur who occassionally rattled the cage which
contains this list~ for conversational sake. Otherwise
I strongly suggest that the magazine folks
could/should be at least lurking on the list and be
aware of the VW communities opinions. If not then I
feel that they need to wake up and pay attention.
I salute VWTrends for at least trying to update their
graphic design and presentation. Nice look has
continued to evolve and refine over the past year and
a half. Paula and I are thankful to HotVWs for
including Paula's camper~but that was yesterdays news.
The artistic stylizations in HotVWs are also very
cool. What's next, quality writing?
I concur with the ideas which call for an insertion of
creative thinking compared to regrinding the same old
**** month after month. Creative writing with fun
stories as have been found in the NEATO Old Bus Review
is welcomed. &lt;Mr. Easterwood is always looking for
contributions to and help with the OBR.&gt; Coverage of
events such as the Burning Man, Jerome, Arkansas,
Maine and North Carolina campouts, St. Louis Arch
event, and events that we hear about on the net and in
personal conversations would be great. I liked the one
blip of a story that appeared years ago in HotVWs
about some folks who ran a junk yard and had a
hippied-out single cab. There are many gurus and salt
of the earth folks out there who would be interesting
to read about. I'd love to read and see more from
South America and South Africa. What is common in
foreign lands might be real curious to the North
Americans. Not everyone is named Gene or can afford to
pull off a jillion dollar raceteam or restoration.
Those things are still interesting but a variety would
be nice. Profiles on VW owners would be interesting.
An interview or 20 questions spread with some lesser
known VW lovers could be interesting.
A business concept that I have suggested to DBs and
HotVW's on several occassions is to repackage old
issues on to a CD collection or onto a subscription
website for the readership who happen to be computer
owners. Web based &quot;push&quot; technologies and channels
lend themselves to this. BOOM there it is- a softball
business concept laid in thier lap. What the heck,
they already own the rights to the material so why
not? They could even include all of the old typos!
Give me 1% commission for this potentially very
lucrative idea. &lt;Holding breath&gt;
In Summary, I don't mean to cap on any of the
magazines. I totally support vendors who travel their
buns off to be at the shows like clockwork or sweat
blood to provide a parts service. My wish is to
encourage them to think beyond the deadlines. Reader
submittals should be encouraged via contest or other
incentives. VW Pro lurkers- I know that you are out
there!
Hire me to rustle up stories and project manage the CD
concept. In the meantime, I am scrambling to meet
previous VW related commitments.
Rant mode off...
