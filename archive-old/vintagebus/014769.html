I've had trouble with previous cars where the battery is fine and then 
suddenly loses connection inside. Older or cheap batteries may eventually 
wear out the plates inside and the connection to the stud on top becomes 
weak. It is enough connection to turn on the lights but maybe not enough to 
keep the engine running or take a charge. I would suggest just having a 
battery store check the charging system and battery. If that is the problem 
it's time for a new battery.

Good luck,

Scott
