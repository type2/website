Kris-
   For those who want a little added protection on the undercarriage of their
bus, I recommend a product called POR-15.  -----This is not for those
individuals who must have a factory undercarriage-------  It &quot;IS&quot; for people
who do not mind having a black undercarriage.  The paint can be applied right
over rust and forms a very strong bond that can withstand a hammer hitting it.
It is the best product that I have found to protect and prevent further
rusting.  It goes on just like regular paint. 
   I used this product to add extra protection on my '56 Deluxe.  Once the
belly pans were installed, I applied POR-15 to all the inside hidden area of
the bus between the cargo floor and the belly pan.  Since some of my
outriggers and my inner rockers were rusted beforehand, I did not want the new
ones to get the same way.
   DISCLAIMER:  Anyone using this stuff needs to follow all warning labels.
This means using the stuff in a WELL ventilated area (outside only).  And make
sure to wear a good mask, not the paper kind found at the auto parts stores.
This is not like regular paint.  It will mess you up if you do not follow
precautions.  I know from experience.
