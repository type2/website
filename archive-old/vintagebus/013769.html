Hi, all! I finally git around to tearing off the PO's attempt at seat 
covering on my 65 microbus deluxe. He had used towel to reupholster the 
seats. Anyway, under all the crap was what I believe to be the original 
coverings. Very worn, very dirty, very torn.

My question is this. They appear to be two-tone covers. Grey(dark green?) 
smooth vinyl on the sides, and a beige(ivory) basket weave on the areas 
that your butt and back go. My bus's original colrs are velvet green and 
white. Any ideas on what this seat material is, and if it is available 
anywhere? I haven't seen it in the major catalogs.

Knowing most of y'all are VW gurus with way more knowledge than 
I(shameless sucking up!), I was hoping I might get some good info! Thanks 
a lot!
