&gt; OK, this isn't the first time I've seen this. Who decided that grabbing

Don't know who started it, but Muir certainly gave the tradition a
boost. I believe it's intended to be a very GENERAL gauge, as in if you
CAN hold it, you definitely aren't overheating and should look elsewhere
for the problem.

Personally, I like Clara's spit technique.
Doesn't Sanka make decaf?
