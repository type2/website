It has been months now since I had worked out all the bugs with the tranny.
Ran fine. Nice and smooth, quiet, shifted great. All was TOO good I guess.

Tonight I had a fellow club member swing by and help me pull the engine and
slide the tranny back some for some mount issues. The bus was a knockin and
the tranny was a rockin. First gear wasn't bad. all the rest had an
unbearable thud at varying intervals.

We jacked it up, put the jackstands under there and took off the wheels.
Started it up and put it through the gears at idle to see if we could get a
better idea of what the culprit was. Each time the knock occured, the tranny
would violently jump. Common culpit in my mind was that the front mount had
sliced through completely.

Now the bus is back together, engine and all. New mount among a few other
non related items. I start it up on the stands again and whamo! there it is
again. Though less violent due to more shock being absorbed by the mount.
It's not trying to jump out of the bus now!

Some of you, especially Ronnie, will remember that soon after putting the
new tranny in I had a similar problem.  The circlips for the crown gear on
one side was not put correctly into the goove and it came loose. Causing the
gear to slide out a bit.

This seems somewhat different though. The sound is close to the same but
unlike last time, the bus can move. So remembering what gave the problem
away last time I checked something. I put it in neutral and went to the
passenger side drum and turned it foreward. The opposite drum turned in the
opposite direction as it should. I turned the drum in reverse and again the
opposite drum turned the other direction. So on to the driver side drum. I
turn it foward and it's fine and the other drum turns backwards. But then I
turn the drum backwards and the other drum didn't turn. The drum i was
turning only turned about 20 degrees from the starting point and stopped.
It's binding :(

So what we got is:

1.    Loud knock
2.    One drum turns, the other doesn't
3.    Drum binds
4.    A bummed out Dan

Does anyone have any idea what It could be?

I am not the most mechanically gifted guy and do make mistakes. I wouldn't
doubt I did it again.
