Rustoleum and also Loctite sell a product called Cold Galvanize Compound.
The dry film is 90+ percent zinc and the balance is epoxy and binder. It
comes in a spray can or 1 gallon brush on. It is the next best thing to real
hot dip galvanize.

I have seen it at Home Depot on occasion in the spray can. It is also
available from industrial supply houses such as Grainger.

&quot;Extend&quot; is also a great product. Get it at your local FLAPS. Try working it
into the gap between the brace and door sheet metal to prevent corrosion.
