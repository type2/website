Perhaps she meant &quot;paint shop&quot; to mean a &quot;shop where one buys paint&quot; 
as opposed to &quot;body shop&quot; which is a place where they replace
plastic panels on late-model cars and charge the insurance 
company a fortune.

There's a couple of paint shops in this area, where you can
waltz in and pickup paint for your samba.

&gt; their shops than a VW bus in primer and ready to paint.
