Subject: Packing material - free for the asking...

I've got quite a few boxes of various shapes and sizes as well as a bunch of
packing peanuts that I've saved for when I send out stuff.  Seeings as how I
don't send out a whole lot of stuff, is there anyone on here that could use
a bunch of free packing material?  A bunch of it is wadded up JCW catalogs
which makes great packing material btw.  It's yours for the price of
shipping if you want it and if it's worth it to you.
