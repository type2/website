The plan was to leave early Friday morning  and get to Casa de Mama in the SF
Bay Area near midnight.  Driving over the Siskiyoos in the daylight.   Had
the bus packed with tools etc  the night before after getting home fromm
work.   but  HAHAHAHA.   Duncan shows up about 10.30,   we go to the co-op to
buy road food....etc

Actually headed onto the road about noon.      South on I -5    Hard to get
lost as we keep the road for about 600 miles.    THrough southern Washington.
 Stopped in Portland (the hitchiker story is interesting.   Let it suffice to
say I picked up a couple of hitchhikers.   WHile we stopped in Portland at a
coffee shop one of them wandered away never to be seen again and as we were
behind schedule I wasn't going to wait, so I booted the other one as well.
Less weight for the bus)

we traded off driving about every 3 hours at gas stops.  The bus just cruised
along.  The weather was good, intermittant showers.  During on in southern
oregon  the drivers side wiper linkage came apart and I was priveledged to
pull the wiper motor to the right to re tighten the screw holding the linkage
togetehr.    with my feet out the drivers door in the hail.    Took the pass
side one off as it was floppy and bugged me.      Broke a snap on screwdriver
bit from my impact driver set undoing the screwsholding the wiper motor in.
hm.   Greased the threads before reinstallation (bolts this time from the
loose sppares in the toolbox)

Stopped at a rest area in the mountains in the light so Annie the dog could
have a walk.    Getting dark into the siskiyoos.  cold by grants pass.
started to snow going up mt ashland.   snow ove rthe ridge.  i deislike
mountain passes in snow.    cleared going down into California (no fruit
veggies or plants)   snow by the road in weed,    stopped for gas in Redding,
 oh sweet mother of christ are gas prices high there.  by this time it's
midnight and we've gone 600 miles.   STop at the next rest area for the night
and get to the Bay area in the morning on Saturday.       futz around
saturday,  enjoy the sunshine and visit.

Show   Sunday morning,    got there sometime in the morning and there is a
big line to get in, so we wait a while, amazed nd the huge amount of VWs that
appear.    Eventually get in the gate and set up some swap stuff and do the
show thing and it's all good clean fun.    Thom FitzP  even has the porta
potty  for his 55 westy.  cool.      I did not find a steering lock for my
61.        If anyone has one I could buy or trade for please pmail me.

Left  the Bay Area sunday 4pm   ( went to Casa de Papa for lunch after the
show)   Drove straight through   it was beautiful and sunny through the
central valley.  the mountain passes were dry.  it was pretty warm actually.
 got back at 6.30.  hm that was longer than going down.  maybe I have the
times messed up.      Well we did spend a bunch of time in Grants Pass
circling the Taco Bell.     Whatever.

If a group of lions is a pride,
What do you call and buunch of bungee cords ?

A knot.

What do you call a group of VW buses in motion?

A caravan

What do you call a group of VWs parked?

A junkyard.

How many hippies can you fit in a VW bus?

One more...and a dog.

I had a wide selection of 8-tracks for entertainment.  Beatles, Gregg Allman,
Van Halen, Jim Croce, and that rockin Cheap Thrills by Big Brother and the
Holding Company,  Melanie,  and more.

So there you have it.   Close to 2 K miles on a 38 year old splittty with a
pile of stuff inside, on the roof rack,  a roof rack on the roof rack, two
people and a dog.  (the 61 turned 38 on april 11- the day of the show-  I
should have brought balloons and party hats) and well I did have to  do the
wiper thing but that was minor.
