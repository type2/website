&gt;Thanks. Do you know of anywhere to find a tool part # listing with a
&gt;description of the tool, etc.?
&gt;gb


No - ALL the people I have ever met with a tool listing, local- or
factory-made, have REFUSED to show them to ANY body. Those lists
automatically make people jackasses, I guess.
Same goes for the blueprints for the local manu tools; THREE people have
claimed to have them, no one ever gets to see them.
And TWO are on this List =)

I have been going through the Bentleys, looking at procedures and writing
down the tool #s.
 :P
