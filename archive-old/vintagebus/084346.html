&gt; Probably the best  solutions would be either to manufacture a duct to 
&gt; go all the

&gt; actually  an
&gt; air scoop on the rear of the roof and duct air from this down into the 
&gt;  engine
&gt; compartment.

&quot;To announce that there must be no criticism of the President, or that 
we are to stand by the President, right or wrong, is not only 
unpatriotic and servile, but is morally treasonable to the American 
public.&quot;  - Theodore Roosevelt
