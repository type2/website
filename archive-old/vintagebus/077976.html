Subject: Re: [VB] Cooling air, gas heaters, and J tubes

Keep in mind most all of these tests were with the heater running full time.
In reality, the heater will cycle like your home furnace, only coming on
enough to heat up the air.  If you ran your heater full time with no
cycling, you would run yourself out of the bus.  The Southwinds put out
20,000 BTU and burn .3 gallons per hour, but that is running one wide open
with no cycle time.

You might run a gas heater full on for a few minutes on a really cold
morning to warm up the bus and thaw the ice on the windows, but believe me,
after just a few minutes, you'll back the heat off and let the heater cycle.

&gt;&gt; I recently installed a gas heater into my bus. As for fuel consumption,
&gt;&gt; I haven't noticed that much of a change. I actually haven't noticed any
&gt;&gt; change, but I'm sure if I whipped out the pen and paper, and did the
&gt;&gt; math, I could see the numbers.
&gt; 
&gt; I am the operator with my pocket calculator.  *

&gt; Check out page 69** of the Eberspaecher BN4/BA6 manuals Thom has up at
&gt; http://66.34.72.138/techinfo/eber/index.html .  It says the BN4 would
&gt; put out 15,900 BTU/hr max, while using 0.20 to 0.65 liters/hr (0.42 to
&gt; 1.4 US pints/hr) of fuel and 50 W (4 A) of electricity.
