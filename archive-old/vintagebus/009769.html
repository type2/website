Subject: [VB] vague recollection on htr box smell

i have a vague recollection of a tech. service bulletin about removing the
*oil-ish* smell from the heater boxes.  basically it explained that the
heads needed to be rebuilt.  i cannot remember the specifics, but it had to
do with the exhaust valves and the mixture somehow seeping past the crappy
exhaust gaskets.  anyway..i DO KNOW that it works as i  have done this.  my
first test i replaced every seal and heater component.  boxes included.  it
helped tremendously, but not completely.  pulled the engine and had the
heads rebuilt, and the smell was gone and did not return all the years i
owned it, until i sold it.

i am sure many of you think you have no smell when you turn the heater on.
well go find a brutally honest woman to go ride with you, then crank on the
heat.  she will tell you in moments if it stinks in there!!

this is just my experience on the head thing...( and it has worked on all
a/c vws i have owned)...

can anyone refute or back up the *tech* bulletin i vaguely remember??
