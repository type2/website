&gt;I've posted this many times.  This is the results of my tire size research:
&gt;
&gt;[...] Bentley says that the 3/4 ton (small nut) models came with a 
&gt;6.40-15 tire, having a diameter of 27.16&quot;, +/- .24&quot;.
&gt;
&gt;[...] One ton (big nut) models came with 7.00-14 tires, having a diameter
&gt;of 26.22&quot;, +/- .24&quot;.

Maybe this has been said before, but hopefully not quite as many times
as the tire thread.  :)  Having said that...

I think it's true that all small-nut RGBs are 3/4 ton, but I don't think
it's true that all big-nut RGBs are 1 ton.  I have a '64 with what I
believe to be the original RGBs; they are big-nut (46 mm across flats),
but the bus is a 3/4 ton and has 15&quot; tires all around.

Here's a list of changes with chassis numbers and dates, from Bentley and
Doliwa:

  5 Aug 1963     1 144 303   1 ton model available (Doliwa)
  5 Aug 1963     1 144 303   Big-nut for all Transporters (Bentley)
  5 Aug 1963     1 145 427   14&quot; tubeless tires for 1-ton models (Doliwa)
(15 Nov 1963     1 203 065   My Bus (per M-code plate))
 19 Dec 1963     1 222 026   14&quot; tubless tires for 3/4-ton models (Doliwa)
  1 Oct 1964   215 036 379   All 1500s are 1-ton (Doliwa)

I know that the dates and chassis numbers from books are not always 
accurate but I am taking them at face value for this discussion.
From the list above, I would conclude:

All 1-ton Transporters have big-nut RGBs.
1-ton Transporters up to and including 1 145 426 have 15&quot; wheels.
  (At most about 1100 units could have been built this way, according 
  to the above).
1-ton Transporters from 1 146 427 have 14&quot; wheels.

3/4 ton Transporters up to and including 1 144 302 have small-nut RGBs.
3/4 ton Transporters from 1 144 303 have big-nut RGBs.
3/4 ton Transporters up to and including 1 222 025 have 15&quot; wheels.
3/4 ton Transporters from 1 222 026 have 14&quot; wheels.

Mostly, people who own early '64s (like mine) with original RGBs
would care about this, I would think.  For what it's worth.
