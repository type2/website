Subject: Re: Hoop Quality?

Does anyone have a set of Derek G's repop hoops?  Quality?  Fit?  Price
you paid?

Hey Mon,

  Derek fabbed me 3 adjustable hoop (reg. height, cab height) and the
are near replica's of the original, and fit great (remember that they are
just a big spring, and bend anyhow).  In order to send them x-country, he
cuts each one in two places and you must re-weld them if you can't pick
them up in LA.  He packed it very professionally.

  As for the price, the amount was two payments COD and I'd have to find
them, but for someone that is doing it on his own - (no VW factory
original tools)...and I believe he is the only one...I was very grateful
to him for making hoops to my specs. and paid him what he asked for, which
I thought was quite fair.  Still, you *must* be patient with him, he asks
for no deposit and will fit it in for you when he has the material and
time.

Best,
joe
