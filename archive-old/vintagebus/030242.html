Concept Car Microbus

A design study for the world of tomorrow as a homage to a great tradition
Wolfsburg/Detroit, 8 January 2001. Volkswagen is showing the concept car
&quot;Microbus&quot; as a world premiere at the North American International Auto Show.The
bus of the future was designed in the Volkswagen design studio in California
especially for the US market.With its original design and numerous innovative
ideas, the Microbus harks back to a great tradition, starting in 1950 with the
first VW bus.This Volkswagen was successful worldwide and reached cult status,
especially in the USA, with the name Microbus.This design study redefines this
cult with an up-to-date expression of personality and freedom.
With the background of the legendary first generation of VW buses, the design of
which is even today as well-known and well-loved as that of the Beetle and the
New Beetle, the designers didn't want to run the risk of merely copying the old
bus style.The aim was to create another Volkswagen original, which was to pay
homage to a great history in its own independent visionary way.Theinnovative
Californian design team has succeeded in doing just this.This independence is
demonstrated on the Microbus by the striking front end with particularly
thin-line Xenon headlights, the design of the side windows and the large sliding
doors.These open and close electronically at the push of a button.The wide wheel
arches guarantee a dynamic appearance.They provide the space for the specially
designed 20&quot; alloy wheels.
High-tech interior for communicative travelling
The Microbus offers 3 rows of seats.The middle centre seats can be turned
through 180 degrees and the third row has been deigned as a seat bench.All
passengers have the protection of an integral seat belt.Intelligent features
such as these are characteristic of many features in the interior. The Microbus
can be transformed into a veritable car cinema:The appropriate visual images are
provided by a 7&quot; screen in the centre console, four monitors in the backrests of
the first and second rows as well as two extendable displays between the second
and third rows.
A second 7 inch screen, located towards the front of the roof area, provides a
view of what is behind the Microbus.The picture is provided by a so-called
backeye camera.Along with both the exterior mirrors, this provides a
comprehensive view of what is behind the vehicle.
