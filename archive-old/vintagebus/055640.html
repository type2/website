&gt; If you get your vehicle in a movie or a commercial, just try to keep this
&gt; in mind:  If the contract doesn't specify that they won't drive it over a
&gt; cliff or blow it up, assume that they WILL.  Even if the people who negotiate
&gt; with you or your car club have some respect for the true value of the
&gt; vehicles, the location crew won't...

I'm on TV/movie sets on a regular basis and always talk with the car wranglers
when they are around.  The above is very true!   Get it in the contract that YOU
are to be the ONLY one to move/drive the vehicle.  If you let them mount a
camera/light/or fixture (I have no idea why you would) specify a non destructive
method.  They can do it.  It takes more time sometimes and can be a pain for the
grips (glorified carpenters) camera assistants (frustrated camera operators) or
gaffers (they move and rig lights or related stuff) but if they want the shot
they will do like you ask...but you need to be there.

You MUST specify total replacement to the exact condition the vehicle was in
when you brought it.  Also, don't forget to make them pay YOU for your time.
Believe me, they have the money.

Lastly, if you have any problems, wait until they are right in the middle of
their big shot featuring your bus.  Then go to the 1st AD (assistant Dir.) and
tell them your problem and that you are leaving NOW if it is not corrected.  It
will either be corrected or lots of money will magically appear.

Ah....Hollywood.   :-\
