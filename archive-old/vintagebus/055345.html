&gt;    &lt;&lt; the bed of my DC has a side-to-side seam never apparently welded, but
&gt;leaks and allows a lake in the cargo/rear cab. would i be wrong in having
&gt;this seam welded, or use a more flexible filler since it wasn't welded at the
&gt;factory? &gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Hi Steve,
&gt;Best to have that seam welded.  On our 1963 SC we welded all four sections of
&gt;the bed panels together to prevent future leakage.  Using silicon is not a
&gt;good idea due to flexing of the panels will loosen this sealant up in
&gt;sections and start leaking again.

nice then. thing is i am now entertaining the notion of removing the two
rear (rir) p/u bed sections to remove the BIG divits where the 800 pound
gorillas got comfortable during a tailgate party. can somebody list the
generalistics on how this may be done. heard about it being possible, but
hadn't heard much on the process. much thanks    - steve
