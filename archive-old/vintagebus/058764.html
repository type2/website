-
I drove around with
shoulder straps mounted to the bulkhead (about 12&quot; below my shoulder)
for 12 years in my 66, I am glad I was never hit. I think I am going to
go to a race shop and see if they will either do the install or give me
some good pointers on the where and how.
hope this helps,
Craig
