Who cares, I have had buses for sale and nobody in the states wanted them,
so overseas they went (England), had 1 go to Japan and the majority of the
ones I have sold stayed in the states and are being used here. But I also
know of buses that were bought by white folk for overseas shipment under the
premise of &quot;Oh cool dud this is the bus I've always wanted and will be part
of my life forever&quot; as it's being loaded on the flatbed for the docks. Does
this mean that we all should run an FBI background check on anybody who buys
a bus to make sure it doesn't go overseas? We all should be thankful that
buses are popular, regardless of where they go, with all this activity a lot
of parts are appearing, lot's of parts never made are being made now and
this isn't because of the few of us that have had buses for a while, but
because there has become a huge demand for the parts because of all the
buses being resurrected we all have benefited. Look at how many of the
listys only had 1 bus, now they have 2,3 or more. Popularity fueled by the
fire of demand. Then if we don't like buses going overseas, should they take
the same attitude and quite shipping parts over to us. Remember that very
few parts for our buses are made in the U S and all come from overseas (as
did our buses originally),

I received an &quot;anonymous&quot; (no name, just the email addy) email today
from a list member telling me that I was basically an a$$hole for
selling *my*, repeat *my* '56 Single to someone who will most likely
send it overseas. I know this is touchy ground with alot of you, but
when I get offered my asking price for a car, I'm selling it. I don't
care where it goes. I know some people get attached to their cars. I
have a couple myself I would never sell no matter what the price. Those
are my &quot;keepers&quot; not the cars I sale for a living. But would it really
make sense to tell someone you aren't going to sell them something
because of where it's going to end up?

I was also told I was an a$$hole for wanting to make my '59 Westy look
earlier............ Who cares I'm still doing it, and if I sell it and
the guy (asian, german, african, who cares!!) with the big bank account
wants it to look like a '59 I can bolt the OG bumpers, tai lights and
decklid back on. No harm done!

No flame suit required, I can take the heat.
