i just replaced the generator brushes on the old 66, now i have this wierd
low pitched whir sound coming from the gen area, sounds kind of like the
starter does when you start it with the engine already running, but it is in
time with the rpms,
it is pretty loud a t high revs, engine seems to be running normal,
any suggestions?

thanks list,
jb
