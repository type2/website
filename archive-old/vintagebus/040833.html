I just got fixing my new bus!
It was presented as a '66 Combi, with a two
tone paint job, white over red.  The interior panels
are the cheapo ones, no pop-outs, so it's a kombi.
No uprights or overriders for the bumpers either.
The right mirror arm is broken off, but the original 
driver side one is round.  It has all of the seats!

Strange muffler that starts correctly out the side,
but then goes straight back.  Oh well.
One wiper arm is a little bent too.
All of this for just seven and half!

I had to do some dis-assembly &amp; re-assembly to get
the front seat re-installed properly, but it went
pretty easy.

Jeff '66 Kombi 1/19 Solido
