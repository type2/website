&lt;&lt; I am going to be reassembling the 64 soon and I was wondering if it was
worth
 it to install an anti sway bar in the front and a camber compensator in the
 rear?  I intend to use it as a daily driver.   
  &gt;&gt;
Hi Dan, 
We installed a stock anti sway bar on our 1960 panel camper when we installed
the 1964-67 front suspension.  It really made a differance in the handling.
Have been wanting to try one of the camber compensators on it also.   Eric &amp;
