Hey Dan,
        I think that making a full tent would be cost prohibitive.However an
full awning would be great.Friends of mine make an awning that they market
thru RMMW.But it is only the width and length of the cargo doors.
A full awning,&quot;same&quot; as an original 50's early 60's,but skip the sides and
door.

ps..      Or how about the teather line 'hooks and &quot;locks' they would be
easy!








&gt; As far as the tents...funny you should mention that.  My neighbor is a
&gt; seamstress who makes most of her money from making wedding dresses.
Surely
&gt; tents are easier to make than wedding dresses.  We have been talking about
&gt; doing some VW tent stuff.  We are checking into the cost of industrial
&gt; machines.  Here is the repro tent question of the day.  Does the tent
&quot;have&quot;
&gt; to be an exact reproduction of a westy tent or would a good quality tent
that
&gt; is very functional desirable?  What do you think functional is? ...with
&gt; floor, without?  Drive away or not?  Any comments welcome.
