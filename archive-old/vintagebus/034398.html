If juggling won't do it, it is perfectly acceptable
to machine (turn) a little from the top of each piston
(take from the highest to equal the lowest) to
achieve a consistent deck height.......make
sure they don't mark your piston up in the lathe
chuck........

All these calcs should be done with reference
to chamber cc.  You don't want the same deck
height if your chambers vary in volume....you
want to juggle things to achieve volumetric balance...

If you really want to get into balancing and
blueprinting, cases are decked to ensure
the same distance from the crank centerline on each
side (remember the crank may not be in
the center of the case, esp. after align boring), so
as this is a 'given' decking allows you to move
the cylinders relative to the crank to achieve
balance...

Another botch of words, as clear as mud.....*sigh*

&gt; I have the same issues with my 36hp.  You cannot just take down one
&gt; cylinder
&gt; because as you state the head will not seal on the jugs properly.
&gt; Hopefully
&gt; you decked your case to assure the same case height under the base of the
&gt; jug.  If so you will need to measure your rods and juggle them to get
&gt; closer
&gt; Deck Heights.
