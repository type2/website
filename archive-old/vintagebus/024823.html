&gt; buses chassis do not unbolt like bugs do.      So if you want to swap your
&gt; good mechanicals over into a decent body that is the best option.     If the
&gt; body on the new bus isn't so great either think about do you want to fix it or
&gt; are you okay with driving it the way the body is or would it be easier to find
&gt; a better one?   There is usually a certain amount of rust and repair panels
&gt; are available.

The body isnt as much as a problem as the chassis and floor. 
 Actually the chassis is pretty shot.
This is why I wanted to lift the body off the chassis.
Apart from not having to rebuild the steering/suspension/brakes again.
I just thought that if the body went on, the body comes off.
