pay enough attention to how the seal and spacer go.  My seal has a metal side 
and a felt side. Which goes toward the backing plate? And the spacer has a 
flat side and a &quot;cupped&quot; side. Which way goes toward the backing plate? &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;

Hi Rex,
If memory is correct the cupped side should go against the spindle. You could 
remove your other drum to make sure!  ;-)   The felt side of the grease seal 
definitely goes against the bearing.  Just make sure to install this seal as 
far as it will go into the drum to keep it from rubbing against the spindle.  
Our 1963SC still has the original VW metal/felt grease seals there that 
probably came with it from the factory.
