&gt; &gt; &lt;&lt; One more thing to beat the dead horse with is this:  People who list things
&gt; &gt; as something they are NOT.   I won't name names as they might be reading.
&gt; &gt; Here is an example.   A part is listed as NOS but in the description the
&gt; &gt; seller says something like &quot;Ok its really not NOS but this thing is CLEAN
&gt; &gt; CLEAN CLEAN  I restored it and its just like NOS but better!&quot;
