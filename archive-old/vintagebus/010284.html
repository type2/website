    I am looking for information (installation instructions) on part # 221
898 062A   It is a retractable step with mudflap that is supposed to be used
with sliding doors  that was discontinued in the US in the early 70's
according to the local VW dealer( Stan Olson's Autoworld Omaha Nebraska) and
he has no further info on it.  No pictures instructions Nothing!!   Just
discontinued!!   The part that I got is supposed to be from the UK
    What I am wondering if anyone in the UK or with access to early 70
literature would have any information on this item?  Also which of the
London VW dealers have been around as long as the early 70's?
Thank you in advance and appreciate any help given as to finding
installation instructions so I can use the step.
