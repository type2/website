I VERY distinctly remember a Bug that Valerie Bertinelli commissioned for
him in the mid-80's.  It was featured int he mags, even.  So I hardly think
he's a &quot;botuque busser&quot; or other nonsense.  He's apparently been into VW's
for quite some time.

&gt;Oh great!! Maybe he will buy a nice one owner orig paint bus and paint it 
&gt;like his f'n guitar!! And this is the last thing the bus community needs, 
&gt;when buses get popular, the fun goes away. Why does he want a bus now, cause 
&gt;Sienfeld has one?
