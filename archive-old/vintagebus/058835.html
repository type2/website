Subject: Running hard/pay back

   Today I finally decided to fix my DD. The buskatiers remember BBB no
rides, locking up brakes. Well I pulled the left rear drum to find my shoes
saturated, damn ATE rear wheel cylinder was leaking (only 25,000 miles or
so). Then I proceeded to drain the RGB's and the trans, nothing unusual
except a few metal shavings on the magnetic drain plugs and BROWN tranny
fluid? WTF I say, I had changed it last year. It must have got condensation
in it from heating up when I drive 75/80 mph and degraded itself. So much
for the specs, I'm going back to 85/140 gear oil, except I'm going to add
Lucas oil to see what happens, maybe a temp gauge on the trans? 
   I am also going to do the front brakes, last year when I checked them
(40,000 plus miles) they were starting to crack and the drums were getting
glazed, need some stopping power so it's time to freshen it all up.
   I'm also going to pull the engine (no oil leaks) it has about 20,000 now
and retorque the heads, they probally need it by now, gotta love the copper
head gaskets. Change the fan, to much vibration. I must have started to
handgernade it with those 6000 rpm revs. 
   Pulled the plugs and it looks like I'm a little lean so I will rejet the
Kadrons, change the oil and I'm ready for another couple years of driving.
   I shouldn't of neglected my pour bus for so long. Almost 4 years and this
is the first major work I've had to do. I don't want to lie, I did put in a
different geared trans a couple years ago and a bigger engine last year. But
haven't had to do anything to either. OOps, I did forget the dropped valve
guides on the new engine (first trip) but that was an easy fix.
   So off I go to the shows again, I will do about 5000 miles in the next 3
weekends, Red Barn, Phoenix Barf-o-Rams and Pomona, yee pee than a couple
weekends off. Maybe get some work done on the DC!
