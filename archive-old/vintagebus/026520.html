Wow, have people just gone nutball?  If you don't like somebody's post just ignore it and move
on... let's talk about VW'S, not all this angst towards vendors, ebayers, etc.

On that note, does anybody have ideas about a good insulating material for heater boxes.  I'm
getting ready to re-install mine and I crave maximum effeceincy. I plan on insulating the tube all
the way from front to back and would appreciate anyone's opinion on the subject.

Also, what should I do about the rear heat?  I have a Westy folding bed over the rear heater tube
and I'm curious how the heat flow will be back there since the tube is basically in a big box.

Again VW'S specificially 67 and prior Type 2's!!!! VINTAGE BUS!!!!
