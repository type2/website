    I liked that bus you had put alot of work into it.  Keep saving them
that should be the goal here on this list to keep as many away from the
crusher as possible. If you have visited the John's web site you can see he
is a good of metal worker to keep this one from the scrap pile. That bus
should be a show winner or in a magazine!


Keep them Running!

&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&quot;It is a sort of subset of the custom vs. stock resto schism. Though
it seems that the stock resto freaks get a fair share of dissing (you'll
hear
&quot;vintage nazi&quot; a lot for anyone who is not pro custom), not just the folks
who make a DD slammed sunroof panel dressed up tart out of what had once
been
a decent honest working bus.&quot;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;

       I normally try and just brush off all the comments I have gotten from
the list, but am tired of the narrow minded, uninformed &quot;opinions&quot; many
people seem to form about a bus they know VERY little or nothing about.  Let
the record show, I have NEVER dissed on anyone's VW project or bus on this
list.

       I beg to differ about the shape of my bus before I started it.  This
bus was bought, for $400, from Lavere's, and was minus ALL it's parts, and
very rusty, with the wrong doors, gas tank, no engine lid, nice toyota high
back seats up front, welded down!!, no side windows, no engine, had a HUGE
hole cut in the roof, and all the supports running side to side had been
hacked out, I am not mentioning all the rust that was ALL the way through
the
rain gutter, and bondo'ed over, and the 200 hundred holes drilled over the
last 40 years or so, which I refer to as home improvements.  That is a much
better description of the original shape of my bus, not a &quot;decent honest
working bus&quot;.  My bus stoped being a decent honest working bus MANY decades
before I saved it.  Not many people would have taken the time, money, or
effort to do ANYTHING with this bus.  Please try and not diss me for SAVING
another VW from the crusher.  And I have saved my fair share.
       Take a look at Dan Kinsey's 58 Binz I built.  A lot of people had
plenty to say about me building my bus (bad stuff), but VERY few stood up
and
said &quot;hey good job on Dans bus&quot;.  I think if you look at the pictures,
you'll
also agree again, not many would have fixed and saved that bus the way I
did!
       Not to diss anyone, but if the issue of my bus is the donor bus parts
from other buses, I have seen pics of &quot;hoopty buses&quot; that were cut up that
actually ran and drove.  Nothing I cut up was ever gonna be restored!
Infact
I didn't even cut them, I bought the parts via the internet, from people
just
like all of you!!!
       Can we stop beating this dead horse!  We all have our own way of
building our VW's.  Can we all just let each other enjoy VW's as a whole no
matter how we build them!
