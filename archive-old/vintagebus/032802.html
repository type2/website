&lt;&lt; hey,
 i popped the deck lid to check the oil this morning and my pulley tin is 
 GONE! WTF, how does that happen, its still screwed in behind the pulley, but 
 the rest snapped off. gonna be 90 today... dont wanna roach my motor. gonna 
 fetch a socket after work for the impact wrench but dont know the size. 
 ALSO, what is spec for tightening the nut... ? ft. lbs.
 thanks first,
  &gt;&gt;
which pulley are you talking about?  the nut on the gen pulley you dont use 
an impact on, hold in notch with screwdriver while tightening with wrench 
securely.

the 30mm bolt on the crank pulley?  is that falling off?  think that is 80 ft 
lbs.  but if you killed the tin in FRont of it, maybe pull off the pulley and 
replace the tin.

some I am not sure what happened there anyway.
