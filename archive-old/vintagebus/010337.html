&gt; Ummm, the only problem was that he forgot to say it was in the &quot;Gallery&quot;.
&gt;  If I didn't have such a big site...

The link I provided automatically takes everyone to the Gallery.  I thought
that mentioning it would further confuse the issue so I just basically
wanted people to click there way in with a minimum of intelligence and
deduction required.  No matter what though Everett - you have a kick ass
site - it's one of the few sites I have find the time to religously check
out.
