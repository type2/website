&lt;&lt; Thom and list,
 My brother bought cargo floor halves from Das Bulli about 3 months ago and
 they never arrived.  They supposedly had problems shipping them and said he
 would be getting them soon.  Now whenever he tries to call nobody answers and
 there is no answering machine.  Anybody know what is going on?

I've called them at least 6 times with no answer or machine. Its hard to
understand why they advertise without having at least an answering machine!. I
did get a year old price list from a friend, and their prices seem high
compared to Rocky Mountain and their distributors, Bus Depot, etc.
