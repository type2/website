You only just now found that &lt;Ronnie's discoveries&gt; out because you live in AZ
and have no need for heat...

Ellis writ:
HEAT!? did someone say HEAT? Gee-whiz, we been havin' heat since March and it's
Damned near Mid November and it's STILL in the mid to higher 90's in Phoenix.
Havasu and Bullhead have generally been hotter than us stuck in &quot;LA in the
microwave&quot;. Anyone who says that summer in Phoenix is only June, July and
August is on crack. I count March, April, May, June, July, August, September,
October and half of November. Sometimes January is warm, February can be rainy
and early March is windy.

I can't wait for late December and the later part of January when the rains
come. First part of January is usually excellent for Volleyball and watching
bikinis in Phoenix and fishing for Bass and metal leader for Pike, P*t, Pabst
and Poo*tang at Stoneman Lake. Later January is warm and sunny in Havasu for
regurgitating by the Bridge and discussing whatever happened to the bus market.

February is only rainy on the 14th when the Az Volkswagen Club used to hold car
shows. March is the start of Summer again.

Winter? Oh, that's usually about December 21-23.

Heat, oh yeah, crank up the gas heaters, electic-bumwoolens and eggnog.
