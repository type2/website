&lt;&lt; Has anyone used a late model bus spindle nut with allen screw to eliminate
the double lock nuts on the early kingpin spindles ? 
 
Hi Everett,
Yes it will work on 1964-67 buses and all pre-1968 type 1s.  The problem is
for the 1955-63 (And probably barndoors also.)spindles have a larger shaft
there so they will not work for these years.  Eric &amp; Barb
