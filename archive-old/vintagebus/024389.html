Subject: Large Screw Update

Thanks to those who responded about the &quot;Large Screws&quot; that are needed
for my Double cab.  These are the screws that hold the door hinges in
place on a bus and the gates in place on a single/Double cab.

Measuring the screw and checking around I found out that it is very
close to (if not an exact match for) a DIN 966 style screw in 8mm
diameter and 19mm long with a 1.25 thread pitch.  (theirs is 8mm x 20mm)

I found a source for these - Molloy Fastener Co in Austin TX and will
soon have a box of them to put to work.
At $18.90 for a box of 100 with shipping, each screw ends up being less
than $0.23 each.  A rough top of the head estimate, I've identified at
least 60 of those screws on my double cab.

No more stripped or buggered headed screws going back into the truck!

Thanks for the help from everyone
