Subject: Re: [VB] the Term &quot;Split Window&quot;

Call your bus by year.  The barndoor folks probably don't like hearing a '67
being called an 'early' bus.....
Must we do this?  This reminds me of a certain (beloved) race of people who
cannot decide what they want to be called.  They choose a term and teach it
to us.  Just about the time the majority of citizens become 'enlightened'
and start using the term, they become offended by it and insist on a newer,
more politically correct word or phrase to describe themselves.  It
nauseates me and your argument is a similar type of hair-splitting (or
baying).  I assume you meant your post to be light in nature, but be careful
as there is no end when you enter the realm of political correctness.
Imagine what old busses would eventually be called.  PC=BS.

PS: That pile of brown toilet paper over there isn't USED.  Why no! It's
PRE-OWNED!  Will anyone further digress or shall we KILL THIS THREAD!


&gt; I don't like, and very rarely use, the terms &quot;Split Window&quot; or &quot;Splittie&quot;
&gt; Early buses came first.  They are buses.  Bay window buses are ... bay
window
&gt; buses.  The term &quot;split window&quot; implies that they have to be distinguished
&gt; from buses - but they are buses.  Also, the window isn't split - there are
two
&gt; of them. If I have to refer to my bus such that I distinguish it from a
bay
&gt; window bus then I call it &quot;my early bus&quot;  or &quot;my 60.&quot;  Am I alone in this?
Do
&gt; I need to just get a grip?
