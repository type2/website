Subject: RE: [VB] engine starter

Call any of your local VW trans shops and ask if you can buy one of there
junk type4 (68 and later bus) bellhousings. You can usally buy a cracked one
or damaged one for 10 bucks. Buy a cheap starter buttom from your local
flaps and use one of your used starters. Total cost approx 25 dollars and
you could bolt it ot an engine stand.

I have looked everywhere, including an infamous auction site and can't find
the maker of the engine starter that clamps onto your engine allowing you to
start an engine on the bench. I know someone must know where to find one.
Thanks
