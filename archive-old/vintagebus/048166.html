I'll second Everett.  The less joints and plastic carrying fuel in my engine compartment the better, especially pressure side.  An old kombi went up around here a few years back because the filter in the engine compartment came apart and leaked gas all over the hot engine.  I am not sure why it didnt burn to the ground, but it was quickly put out and the bus is still around.  Although I am sure more than 1/2 the list has it there, when I see the filter between the pump and the carb I just assume the owner is lazy and uninformed cause thats the easiest place to put it.  I just have extreme paranoia of fire.  Sometimes I think of if it went up and there was nothing I could do what are the easist parts to take off and save while it burns.
