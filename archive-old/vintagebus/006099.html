y'know...

My '66 really was infested!  Probably during its years at the junkyard...and
it wasn't bees or B's, but wasps (not WASPS)....

When removing the upper cabinet for insulation putting and rust-killing, I
found a beautiful mud-hive along with the shattered remains of more.  The
good one went immediately into my studio, right next to the cat skull from
the basement, and my miniature ceramic skull, etc...

But if you ever wanna see some bee infestation, go to the VW boneyard in
Lake County, owned by Tom Coddington...

Now there's some bees!

Gotta run...I need to B at work in 15...
