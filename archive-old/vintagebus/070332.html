&gt; Sometimes there, sometimes not.  It's wierd.  Could be in the

I don't know if this is possible, but could the rancho tranny actually
be pushing the throw-out bearing farther than necessary? causing more
pressure on the bearing &amp; some noise or even binding? Just a thought I
had. Hell I'm not even sure if this can happen, I have never measured
what the stock travel distance is :)

&gt; I also am getting a carryover noise from when the engine was in the
&gt; '71, which must mean potential gland nut badness -- again, a very
&gt; inconsistent release-bearing type noise that mostly happens when the
&gt; pedal is completely depressed (but this same release bearing was
&gt; there before, and no noise).  I may do some exploring this weekend
&gt; and will report back what I learn.

if by some miracle my above suggestion has merrit, I suspect loosening
the clutch adjuster nut would make the noise go away. worth a shot I
guess.
