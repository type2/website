Subject: Re: [VB] oil cooler heater

anyone used these oil cooler type heater? does it work? and if so is it
better
than the stock heater boxes?
---------------------------
This subject has been the discussion of many air cooled drivers.
If you choose to install an oil cooler and use it as a heater inside your
van.
Put the cooler as close to the engine as practical, the farther it is
from the engine the more oil pressure you loose on the return line. If
you put it too far away you will starve your engine when the engine first
starts with cold oil, I just don't think you'll have enough flow. 
If you don't have very good oil pressure at all RPMs currently I just
would avoid this installation.
Use fans and ducting to get the heat to the location you need it.
I use a Mazda RX7 oil cooler under my Westy on my 83 Air Cooled Westy,
the cooler is approximately 6 feet from the sandwich plate adapter and it
works great without drops in oil pressure. It has a 148 degree thermostat
built in.
The ideal situation would be to run the cooler ducting for interior heat
in winter and divert the discharge outside in the summer months. In
either case I think you will need a thermostat ............... you need
about 200 degrees oil temps for good engine operation. (Most people run a
180 degree thermostat).
I've sent a picture of my oil cooler on my 66 Westy. It might give you an
idea of an installation that you can make. With a simple box and hose
arrangement the warm air could be directed to the interior in winter
months. There isn't any attachment to this E mail you'll need to follow
the link. http://williamwareagency_dot_com/forsale/moilcooler1.jpg
