	On the backup light switch I may have a cheap and easy way. Since your
the kind that can make most anything work for you, you can probibly make
one for next to nothing.
	On a 65 type 3, I parted out for parts for my notch, there was an after
market backup light switch hooked to the shift rod in the back just in
front of the coupler. There was a piece clamped to the shift rod that had
a 90deg. bend, that when the shifter was in the reverse position this
bent piece would push on a backup light switch, that is mounted on the
pan. As soon as I redo my notch I'm going to put it on so it will have
backup lights.
