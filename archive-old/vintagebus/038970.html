&gt; Buy yourself
&gt; some nylon tubing long enough to go from the tranny fill plug to the
&gt; side of the bus and ABOVE the fill plug.  Also buy or renta faily

...or, get the pump made by CRC (&quot;Sta-Lube&quot;, I think) that screws right
onto the 1gal bottle of trans oil.  The business end even has these
nifty little barbs that hold it in the fill hole, and the nozzle is
small enough to fit the steering box too.  Don't forget to check the oil in
that, too, same stuff but it does _not_ share fluid with the tranny :-) .

They must have made this thing with VWs in mind, but I got it at the local
Pep Boys, more mainstream than that you do not get.  Well worth  $3.50.
