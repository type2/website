&lt;&lt; Did a '59 bus ever come with a straight shifter or were they all curved 
back at the base?  On the front section of the shifter tube where the shifter 
went, did that have a slot in the front or not.  &gt;&gt;
Hi Doug,
Somewere in the 1959 year the shifter was moved forward away from the front 
seat.  Before this change the shifter was striaght and had not pin coming out 
of the ball to lock it from turning in the forward shift linkage.  Later when 
the shift was moved foward there was a bend put into the shifter and the pin 
in it's ball to keep it from turning.   Eric&amp;Barb
