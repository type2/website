Subject: Re: [VB] winter is coming-heater question

Kevin the controls on the SW heaters are pretty straight forward.  From the
factory, the control unit was a push pull cable with a turn knob switch on
the end.  You would pull the knob out a little bit, then turn the switch.
The switch is just an off/on switch to power the unit, pulling on the cable
set the thermostat so the temperature of the air coming out of the heater
would either be warm (cable pushed in) or melt your tennis shoes hot (cable
pulled out).  You could install a push pull cable, then a toggle switch
beside it and do the same thing as the original.

I carry most of the rebuild parts and original factory service manuals for
the SW heaters along with many used parts (no I don't have any bus control
cables at this time).  I don't work on the heaters, I just don't have the
time.

Well I got this stewart-warner heater a while ago...(1 1/2 years?)
 
It has been sitting in my basement, but I think I am really going to get it
installed before this winter(I hope). I got some manuals on installation
etc...but it is missing some duct work-which I could probably
fabricate...but its also missing the switch-or whatever that controls it up
front. 
 
I just saw one for sale on thesamba-but it is for a eberspacher-does anyone
know if these are compatible?
