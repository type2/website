Andy-
- First we disconnected all of the petal and gearshift assemblies.

- Then we used a cutoff wheel to take out my front floor.  You will need
several 3 or 4 inch wheels.  We found these to be cheaper when bought in bulk
from local automotive paint supply stores.  There will also be a few spot
welds that will need to be taken care of underneath at the frame rails.  I
left a small lip (about 1 inch) when we cut the floors out to support the new
pan.  This will prevent butt welding and make your front floor stronger.

-Once you have welded the new floors in, grind down the welds flush for a
better look after painting.

-The best suggestion that I can give you is to study the way that your
original floor was installed at the factory.  Try and figure out how you can
make it look close to the same.  AND MOST IMPORTANT...TAKE YOUR TIME!!!  It
was far from an afternoon project for 2 people.

Good Luck!
