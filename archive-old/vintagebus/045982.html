&lt;&lt; Have looked through the archives and found lots of stories (particularly
 of harrowing experiences) regarding the 'tow home', but am now needing a
 bit more of the practical experience the group may have. &gt;&gt;
Hi Michael,
Unless after you go through the rear end completely to make sure it will roll 
properly.  Plus you are willing to put out a minimum of $300.00 to get a 
Uhaul moving truck and tow dolly.  You might be better off taking a friend 
and a reliable engine up.  Replace and/or clean up all of the brake system, 
and repack the front bearings and change the tranny oil after checking all of 
these bearings.  Then check the front suspension for repairs, adjustments, 
and grease the zerk fittings.
  We have done this to a friensds bus in 11 hours and then drove it the 300 
miles home safely all in one two day weekend.  Eric&amp;Barb
