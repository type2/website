Subject: Re: [VB] Things to do while yanking my engine

new fuel line
make sure your fuel line and electric wire grommets are good
check axle boots- replace if cracked or torn
change gear oil (this includes RGBoxes)
rear brake hoses if needed.  bleed rear brakes (easier with engine area empty)
starter bushing good?
grease clutch cable threads
main seal /FW oil ring
Clean engine compartment (you may want to do this before pulling motor)
if fuel sender is bad replace it. (think new ones are about $35, I put one in 
my westy)
engine to body seals
check tranny mounts.

not clear on why you want to change the exhaust valves.  Is the compression 
good?  If it ain;t broke don't fix it.   If I was getting heads rebuildt I'd 
probably buy new ones, and check the rings/ps/cs and swap in new rod 
bearings.  But if the engine doesn't smoke or have bad compression, I'd leave 
it together, just check head nut torque.

&lt;&lt; After owning Patience for a year and a half I am pulling the engine (my 
first) 
 to do a myriad of things.
 
 The main reasons are to chase down a persistent oil leak on the left side 
 (guessing oil cooler on the 1600dp), get Time-Serts put in the #2 and #3 
 sparkplug holes, putting in new engine tin seals, and put in air flaps in 
the 
 fan shroud.  
 
 &quot;While I'm at it,&quot; I am planning pressure washing it, on getting new exhaust 
 valves put in (no idea as to the old ones' mileage -- no stretching yet), 
 checking on the existence of a Hoover bit, flushing the oil cooler, check on 
 the clutch, checking the endplay, and replacing the crankshaft seals.
 
 Can anyone recommend some other common items I should check on or do &quot;while 
I'm at it?&quot; &gt;&gt;
