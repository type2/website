The most egregious example of this was a bug that was running around
the Sacramento/Elk Grove area for a while.  The owner *works* at a VW shop.
It was a 1954 body on a 1952 pan, with a 2L engine and *CABLE BRAKES*!
Aiyyiyii!  Yeah, you go on ahead, I'll catch up with you in the ER...

&gt; That also comes up with some locals around here.  Brag about their dual 48s 
&gt; and big exhaust with no mention of braking improvements. In fact most of them 
&gt; are still running just plain old stock systems.
