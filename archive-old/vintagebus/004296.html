At the risk of being unoriginal here, I put an original  Bremen &quot;S&quot;
SW/MW/LW and mounted an '80s Renault LeCar roof mount antennae on the '67
roof for now. Looks &quot;German&quot;, because it is all chrome w/ rubber base on the
bottom and nobody knows until you tell them... and now I've told the whole
list!

If I should come across an original German roof mount, I'll change it. The
other advantage to this antennae is the hole into the roof for mounting is
extremely small at approx.4mm.

Apologies once again for sharing this &quot;non-original VW thought&quot; for a
possible short term solution....

&gt;
&gt; I just aquired a Blaupunkt Frankurt radio for the '60 DD panel, and now
&gt; I need an antenna for it.  I'd like to get one of the &quot;up the center
pillar&quot;
&gt; style that has the mount on the roof, like i had on the '55, but I don't
&gt; know where to get one.  The other option would be the &quot;traditional&quot;
double-post
&gt; mounted over the emblem.  I have safaris, so I can't mount one on the
side.
&gt; I don't like the spring-base antennas; I had one on the '56, and it ended
up
&gt; chipping the paint on the rain gutter.
