You're assuming a relatively normal wiring harness.  I'm pretty sure
that what I've got at the moment is one filament on each side is wired
together to the right blinker relay, and one filament on the left is
wired to the left blinker relay.  This would give exactly the symptoms
I'm seeing.

I'll be playing with it again this weekend (if not before, but
probably not), and will post an update on what I actually find.
