My garage is in it's infancy still....or senior citizen days, I'm not sure
which. We live in an old mine (coal) complex (our house is a big industrial
building that used to house the locker rooms and wash house, payroll office,
etc.). Behind our house is a building that once was a foundry building where
the power was generated for the entire mine complex and valley. That
building is collapsing slowly (brick), but hidden within that building is a
cinder block structure that was built after the mine shut down in the 40's.
It was a huge meat locker/processing facility for selling meat on the black
market during the war. It is very well insulated with cork, has an I-beam in
the ceiling that they must have used as a runner for hanging sides of beef
(will be fabulous for lifting engines!), and is about 30 ft.X 40 ft.  All it
needs is a hole cut in the side for a garage door and a dehumidifier! Oh
yeah, and all the *crap* from the PO cleaned out of it and hauled to the
dump. We plan on building work benches, installing a lift, a compressor, and
who knows what else. My '67 Beetle will be restored there, and my '60 single
cab, 2000 BMW R1100RT, 83 BMW R65LS, and 78 Honda Hawk 400 will be stored in
there.....ummmm....maybe, if we can fit them all. :-)
