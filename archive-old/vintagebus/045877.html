 Hi,
 
 What ever happened to the fine mesh screen filter in the fuel pump?
 And hey, there is supposed to be another one in your gas tank over the
 outlet!!  If it makes it through both screens it will likely make it
 through your smallest carb jet too. It seems to me that the list
 generaly agrees that &quot;the factory&quot; knew what it was doing. Do you
 really need anything more? Gas in this country is normally pretty
 clean stuff. Where are you all drivin? Mexico?
 
 Just my 2 cents.

the stuff that was my problem got through these screens, and there was a 
bunch in the carb bowl, and clogging jets.  or lumped up inside the tank 
around the inlet screen.   The screens were okay.   If the bus had been 
regularly driven, this would not have happened.  I think Thom 55 westy sat 
for much longer than mine did, but its a damper climate here.

I had found also found pine cones in the gas tank of the 54 kombi that mike 
and I went and got years ago.  the gas cap had been left off, and I think 
some rodent had put them in..  then they expanded, which meant you had to 
dismember them in situ as they wouldn't roll out with the tank up side down 
and shaken.

then there was the 70 westy that had sat 10?  years and the gas in it had 
turned to some sort of wierd chemical that was bad.   Ended up with a 5 
gallon jerry can in the spare wheel well and a piece of fuel hose running to 
it.  I'd rather deal with plain old rust
