They shouldn't be squealing. My truck has a single cicuit system with domestic
shoes and the bus has the dual circuit conversion and German shoes. Neither
one squeals.

I had a set of front shoes once that squealed no matter what I tried. I finally
took them to them back to FLAPS and got them exchanged. That fixed the problem.
It sounds like you have a set of defective shoes too.

&gt;Our brakes are *embarrassingly* loud.

&lt;big snip&gt;

&gt;Common sense tells me that this is not right or
&gt;acceptable. What's the consensus?
