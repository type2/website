Subject: BBB VII high res pics needed

  Hot VW's is going to do an article on BBB, they were there but would like
to get some more pics. I need some high resolution digi or prints of BBB VII
to send to them. They cannot use pics off the net due to the low resolution.
Any help would be appreciated.

45 bay windows, down from 52 in 2002

3 Eurovans
and at least another 50 buses that did not register
