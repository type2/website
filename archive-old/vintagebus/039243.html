Listees,

Some have asked to be informed of the funeral arrangements for Josh.  They
will be held at the First Baptist Church Assembly Center located at 6th and
Central in Ponca City, Oklahoma Friday at 2:00.

The collection of all your condolences is coming together nicely.  If you
want to be included, please post your messages by 5:00 central time.  I need
some time to finish putting it all together tonight and must work Friday
morning prior to leaving for the funeral.

Many thanks,

Rob Dahlgren
