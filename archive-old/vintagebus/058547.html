Subject: Re: [VB] EZ windows

For those with the EZ/Sundial type of windows, some of the gaskets/seals are
available at Wolfsburg West. Also, I replaced one of my broken crank
assemblies with one that I bought at Camping World.

&gt; That's pretty good! Jealousy vs. envy type windows may be the question that
&gt; leads to the down fall of man!:) Anyway, the subject of camper windows is
&gt; very much on the forefront of my restoration project on my '62 EZ Camper
&gt; right now. I have a set of 5 HEHR windows that came on both EZ and Sundial
&gt; camper conversions, I don't know what to call them, (jealousy or envy?) I
&gt; believe that jalosy windows are the louvered windows with 3 or 4 separate
&gt; panes, correct me if I am wrong? I my assumptions are right, I do not have
&gt; those, but I have the single hinge windows that have the operator track
&gt; running down the middle of the single pane of glass.
&gt; 
&gt; What I am hoping to find out is:
&gt; 
&gt; 1. Should I fix all the operators of this set of windows? Or should I trade
&gt; them or buy a set of functional jalosy louvered type windows to use in their
&gt; place? Are the windows that I have rare?
&gt; 
&gt; 2. Does anyone know where I can get the hardware to fix these windows? I
&gt; have a couple leads but I would like to hear what the list has to say.
&gt; 
&gt; This will really help me to make a decision about what I should do.
&gt;
