Just wanted to let everyone know that www.vwbus_dot_net now provides you with
the ability to include a picture of your vintage VW when you place it in our
free classifieds.  We have also recently moved to a quicker more reliable
backend database.  Any comments or suggestions on how the site can be
improved are always welcome.

Thanks,

Todd Hackett
