 Howdy, y'all! Two quick questions. I have a pedal pan for my 65 deluxe.
 It's in rough shape. What other years use the same pan, so that it would be
 a bolt-in replacement?
 
 My second question is, I have found a company that can reproduce thes pans
 for me in fiberglass. Would there be any interest among the listees for
 such an item? The more he makes, the less per unit cost there is. I'm not
 trying to make a profit, just spread out the costs if there is any interest.
  &gt;&gt;
pretty much all post barndoor splits pedal pans are interchangable, but the 
late ones with the dual circuit MC can only use the ones they came with, 
although an earlier one can use a dual MC one, so if you repro them makes 
sense to use a 67 one as a template, then it will fit 3/55 through end of 67 
model year.   What price range are you looking at?   LIke VeeWee said, if 
they are much more than $30, you probably would find it hard to move them.  
Then again, there is a demand for them, helps prtect the pedal area and keep 
water/wind from getting to the cab floor, etc, so I am sure you can sell some 
if it is a decent repro.  so what if it is fibreglass?  functionally the 
same, and wont rust?   would they break if hit by a rock or something?  well 
if it was that bad it would put a nice dent in a metal one and who really 
looks under there anyway?
