what year is the bus?  66 or 67?  do you have the dreaded relay box? highly
unlikely the highbeams blew both of the fuses unless a wire actually
shorted from the relay or from the switch.  if you have the box, check
grounds, or maybe it's time for another box. if not, what year is it?

&gt; So I'm driving down the road last night about 9:45 pm (dark) and I decide
to try to switch on my high beam headlights, as i flip the switch I lose
the headlights completely!!  When I hold the the switch toward me and not
release it I can get the lights to work sporadically.  So, does this sound
like a switch problem (my first guess), an electrical wiring problem (it
wouldn't be surprising seeing some of the other electrical things done by
the PO), or just that the high beam setting on both my headlights is out
(it couldn't really be that simple could it?!?!?)
