&gt; Sounds like it was driven a lot with the e-brake on. Ouch.

I would have thought so too. But this happened on my own bus. I have done
some loopy stuff in it but to the best of my knowledge driving around for
months on end with the e brake on is not one of them ;-) Would it require
months of driving to do this or would a day or two be enough?

The e brake cables also seem to move feely enough with the drums and shoes
off. Is there any reason other than the e brake having been on that could
explain this?

If there isn't then the only thing that I can think of is that the mech that
I sent the bus to for the front end overhaul drove it around with the e
brake on. He is the only person who has driven this bus for more than a mile
other than me for a couple years.  

Later
