Okay - as for the thrust washers, you need to read the Bentley - it does a
far better job explaining it.  Hopefully by now, a listee with more
knowledge than me has stepped up the plate and explained it to you.  I can
help you with the hockey stick thing.

When you pull the trans and look at it head on with the nose cone off, all
the selector forks should be lined up so that the hockey stick can swivel
around to either of the 3 gear selector forks.  When the hockey stick
swivels around all the way counter clockwise, this is the reverse selector
and the hockey stick cannot go past this fork because it will simply not
allow it to swivel any farther.  If this is pulled out, reverse is engaged
so push on it firmly to take it out of reverse.

The next fork going clockwise is your 1st and 2nd gear selector.  It can be
in one of 3 positions - 1) all the way in 2) all the way out 3) somewhere in
the middle.  You want choice #3 and it will be lined up with the reverse
fork at this time to allow the stick to swivel freely between the 2.  Going
around clockwise you will find yet another fork.  This is 3rd and 4th gear.
You will want to follow my steps for the 1st and 2rd shift fork.  There are
3 positions it can be in.  Choose the middle one like you did before.  Once
setup, this will allow the hockey stick to swivel freely between the
different forks.  The reverse fork and 3/4 forks are designed to not let the
hockey stick go any further in it's rotating motion however, the 1/2
selector is open so that the hockey stick can pass freely through it.  Makes
you appreciate the VW designers because they knew exactly how much movement
you had between the reverse gear and the lockout plate so that you actually
would hit 1st or 2nd gear and not a space in between - pretty neat huh?
This also explains why it can be hard to find 1st and 2nd gear if your
shifting isn't adjusted &quot;just so.&quot;

See if this helps you or not - I really hope it does.
