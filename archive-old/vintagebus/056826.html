&gt; Once again, thanks for the good information. One of these days I'll make it

&gt; A further question on the subject of burning gasoline at high altitude: 
&gt; several
&gt; friends (neither engineers nor mechanics I should note) have told me that 
&gt; my
&gt; engine would do better (&quot;more horsepower!&quot;) at high altitude if I use 
&gt; higher
&gt; octane gas. Is this myth or science? I tend to use regular gas, that is 
&gt; what the
&gt; engine builder said the compression ratio was set up for, but every now and 
&gt; then
&gt; I throw in some premium because I don't know any better...

Hi Joel,
Glad we could help!  Using a higher octane gasolene will not help increase HP 
at any higher altitude and unless your compression ratio is too high already 
for lower altitude and lower octane fuel is useless.  With gain in altitude 
your CR actually drops off due to the less amount of 80% nitrogen, 18% 
oxygen, 2% trace elements per cc that you squeeze with those P&amp;Cs.  
  So unless you have a way to increase your CR (By installing a supercharger 
or turbocharger.) as you gain altitude it is more than useless.  
  On the other hand higher octane fuel does seem to run slightly cooler.  
When on our trips to Sacrameto Ca. area from Washington State we more often 
then not find ourselfs traveling through 85+F weather.  When we hit Ashland 
Oregon in the foothills of the Syskyious mountians we tank up on midrange 
octane fuel instead of the low range stuff we run normally.  We continue to 
use this fuel down through Sacramento and back to Ashland where we usually 
refuel with the lower octane again.  From this amount of travel we have 
noticed about a 10F drop in oil temp.  This is helpfull to keep us below 220F 
during this hot and hill climbing part of our trip!
