&gt; [...] my link states:
&gt; &quot;The Fish Carburetor is an old after market design
&gt; from the 50's. It can be **adapted to run multiple
&gt; fuels**.&quot;
&gt;
&gt; Thus my interest in the Fish for is for alternate
&gt; fuels.

As I understand it, you can run propane and gasoline
on the same engine - basically you have the propane
carb and the gas carb and can use either.  Using
two different liquid fuels, like gasoline and alcohol,
is more interesting but still doable.  I would guess
that because of the different energy contents of
different liquid fuels, you would need different
jet sizes and settings in a regular carb to run 
multiple fuels.  You might be able to rig up one
carb to be &quot;switchable&quot; in this way, but it might
be easier to fangle an intake manifold with two
carbs on it and valving that lets you use one carb
or the other.  Maybe not the best thing in terms
of flow efficiency, but it would allow relatively
painless (wrench-free) switching between fuels.

If you just want to run on one alternate liquid
fuel, you can probably re-jet your plain old Solex
to work just fine.  The other consideration is
the seals and rubber lines used in the fuel system
and their compatibility with the fuel you want
to use.

&gt; Why alternate fuels? Govm't regulations favor
&gt; the use of these conversions for taxes and less
&gt; restrictive smog regulations.

This probably won't work in Hawaii, but in the
northeast US, the simplest way to do this is to
buy a diesel-engined vehicle and run home heating
oil in it.  Illegal (fuel tax evasion) but it saves
you a lot of money.  :)

&gt; I am *not* trying to get 100MPG in my bus.

Like I said to NQ, I don't mind if you try.  Again,
it is In My Humble Opinion that such a pursuit uses
energy that could be spent better elsewhere.
