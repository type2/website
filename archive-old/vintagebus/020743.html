Subject: Re: [VB] Polishing Aluminum

Great advise.  So where is your freind located and how
much would it cost?
Aren't you in Wisconsin?

&gt; 
&gt; OK, my experience with polishing aluminum on two
&gt; busses and a trailer is that in the end the best
&gt; solution is to take your aluminum pieces to a
&gt; professional polisher.
&gt; 
&gt; A friend of the family does a lot of polishing for
&gt; the
&gt; custom Harley crowd. He has commercial grade high
&gt; speed  grinding wheels fitted with various buffing
&gt; wheels and uses a series of compounds and cleaning
&gt; solutions.
&gt; He also used gloves, big time OSHA appropriate eye
&gt; goggles and a heavy duty breathing filtering mask to
&gt; prevent silicosis or any similar damage to his lungs
&gt; while using the high speed equipment and misc.
&gt; polishing compounds.
&gt; 
&gt; &lt;PROTECT YOUR LUNGS and EYES!&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; I spent a zillion hours using steel wool, Mother's
&gt; polish, Semi-chrome, Never-dull batting wool, a home
&gt; drill and still did not achieve what the pro did in
&gt; record time. If your time is worth anything I would
&gt; go
&gt; the pro route. The money spent will allow you to
&gt; either accomplish other things or earn the money to
&gt; pay for the polishing. Use your head and other
&gt; talents
&gt; unless you have time to burn and the right
&gt; equipment. 
&gt; My thought is that as a project manager of my
&gt; hypothetical restoration it is wise to recognize
&gt; that
&gt; I/you cannot be the best source for *ALL* skills. A
&gt; good manager will know when to use other
&gt; craftspersons
&gt; and who they are.
&gt; Of course, there will be the alpha-doggian type
&gt; detractors out there who will disagree trying to
&gt; prove
&gt; that their manhood &lt;sorry, Clara/Lois G.&gt; is bigger
&gt; than the other guy and *has* to do everything from
&gt; smeltering their own iron ore, refining their own
&gt; petroleum products to formulating their own paint.
&gt; Give it a rest. You won't be using your manhood to
&gt; polish the aluminum. Keep it in your pants while
&gt; operating high speed equipment!
&gt; If you desire the &quot;chrome&quot; appearance then I say cut
&gt; the crap and don't cheap out on such of a
&gt; potentially
&gt; critical step. Look in the phone book under
&gt; polishing
&gt; or seek out opinions from various custom Harley
&gt; builders as to who has the best rep in your area.
&gt; -------------------
&gt; On the other hand, (I've said this before) the super
&gt; chrome appearance is not stock for camper windows
&gt; and
&gt; if you are attempting OG &quot;restoration&quot; then great
&gt; results might be achieved at home. My window frames
&gt; were bent and had reptilian crackle texture to them
&gt; due to severe weathering. Personally it made no
&gt; sense
&gt; to me to spend the time and money doing up all other
&gt; aspects of the '67camper project and installing
&gt; messed
&gt; up-less than optimum windows. Pro polishing will
&gt; eventually dull down slightly and be great. Don't
&gt; ever
&gt; use any lemon based products or mag wheel cleaner on
&gt; previously polished aluminum.
&gt; 
&gt; Good luck
