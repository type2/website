Subject: Re: [VB] VW air compressor

Lewis and I have a neat homemade VW compressor - a case with a crank that
has been modified to run on two cyls, using the other two as the
compressors!
I am not sure how it all functions (it is in pieces in my shed tight now)
but I know some of the crank oiling holes are welded up. A real butcher
job, but Lewis said it was working when he got it (I think he salvaged the
case to use in a bus a few years back...).
I'll get a photo of the crank up later.
