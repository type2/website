&quot;In today's modern &quot;Zero Tolerance&quot; policy U.S. military, where in naval
shipboard aviation, is hemp used daily and why is it used there??&quot;
- --- - - -  -- - 
rope sounds too easy-

how about one of these uses:

in oakum- used for caulking on boats
for the rear propeller shaft log seal, so water won't leak through there
in the valve seats of large hydraulic anchor windlasses

and specifically for aviation on ships:

in the valve system of high pressure steam rams used to launch the aircraft

ps, what are the wicks (for oiling, under the plastic cap) in the hinges of 
the low hinge doors on splittys made of?
  could it be hemp?
