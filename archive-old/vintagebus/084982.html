Subject: Re: [VB] link pin zerk won't take grease

Hi iamdonquixote,
Do yourself a favor and just take the link pins apart, give them a good  
cleaning and make sure the outer cap holes are open to let old grease out.   We 
found out long ago that was the only way to insure that new grease gets  through 
both halves of each link pin.
