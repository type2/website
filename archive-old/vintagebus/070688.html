Subject: Re: Pop Out Frame

Hello Everyone


    I was wondering if anyone would have a pop out frame that they would
be willing to sell me or junk yard/ shop that might have one. I am in
need of one for my 65 deluxe and all the rest of pop out are in
excellent condition. I had one bad piece of rubber in one and the frame
went bye bye. I live in central California if anyone is close I could
pick it up or if not I don't mind paying for the shipping. I would like
an original frame because of how well they fit compared to the remakes.
I only need the frame the glass I have is in good shape.



Thanks in advance,
Eric Lykens
65 Deluxe  
(One frame away from being on the road!!!)
