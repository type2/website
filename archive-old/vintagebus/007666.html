Subject: VW Online Sales Job
Date: Mon, 22 May 2000 17:59:14 -0700

My local dealer has approached me about becoming his first online sales guy.
He knows I'm heavy into VW's, and he knows I've been involved in the
internet. I've taken my 66 Westy out to the dealership a couple of times
when I've stopped in for one thing or another, and I bought my daily driver
a Y2K beetle turbo from them.
Currently, I sell advertising for a food processing trade magazine. I've
developed their internet products and the job is pretty cool but I'm not too
fond of the industry itself.
With the recent discussion on the list about bad experiences at car dealers,
I'm  wondering if I couldn't have some fun, be around VW's and maybe provide
an uplifting experience to prospective customers. They also sell F**Ds and
M***DAs. I also figure I can get my bus into the service bay on occasion for
some of those things that are hard to do without a lift...right now it's on
jackstands, something's rubbing on the right front brakedrum and I can't
wrestle it off the hub. Any thoughts on the above would be appreciated.
