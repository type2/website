Subject: [VB] fried egg inner lens color minutia
Message-ID: &lt;0.85fc8ea3.255ade9e_at_aol_dot_com&gt;

SHORT:
What color was the front turn signal inner lens for 1962 and 1963 model year 
USA spec splitties?

LONG:
USA spec front turn signals for 1962 and 1963 model year were fish eye / 
fried egg as opposed to euro spec which were still bullet.   For 1964, they 
all changed to fried fish eye eggs and the lens on the inside was amber.  I 
had always thought that the inner lens was clear for 62-63.  My 63 (unknown 
history) has a clear lens.  I thought I had read this somewhere, but 
searching my stuff and the archive (&quot;turn AND signal* AND color OR amber&quot;) 
came up short.  So, here is another point of minutia to dwell on.
