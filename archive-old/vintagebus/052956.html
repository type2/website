I think my bus has a 1400 cc motor.  The PO said it was 1400 cc (I think =
- and it was 4 years ago) and the engine number shows motor originally =
came from a 61 beetle.  With the new (actually used and of unknown =
history) transmission and small nut redux boxes 60 mph in 4th is no =
problem. What about carburetion.  I still may try and use the ol' PCI =
that I rebuilt - but what would be optimum?  I'm actually happy with the =
28 PICT (currently in pieces - soaking in cleaner) but what would give =
me the most power with minimal lost of mpg?  Any ideas out there?

TIA
