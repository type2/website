On the right side of the bus engine bay, on the horizontal 
part of the engine bay.  Find the joint between the rear apron (the
section the door latches to) and the piece of metal forward
of the joint.
Just forward of that joint, in the middle of that joint,
is the number stamped into the metal.  Loads of crud
in that area can cover the number easily. It runs at
a diagonal to match the edge of the joint.

Right where you would place a container of oil with
your right hand if the apron wasn't there.

It may be different for the early years, this location is
where I found mine on the '67.
