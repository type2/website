&gt; I have used

&gt; a good used late
&gt; model case with the big oil galleys and spend your
&gt; valuable shop time
&gt; putting together an engine that will haul your bus
&gt; around comfortably

I tend to agree.
One of the big problems that the old 1200cc cases
seemed to suffer was pulling studs.
Ask around, find a decent 1600cc case that hasn't been
thrashed too much and build you engine from there.
The parts will be cheaper and the engine will last
longer.
Some folks say SP heads, others say DP.
Make your own choice, but don't try &amp; go nuts with a
1200 case if you can get the same power/torque with a
case meant to do it.
In the end it's up to you.
:o)
Cheers &amp; God Bless
