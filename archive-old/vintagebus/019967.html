&gt; So my question is... what is the real scoop on the subject?

I figure the engineers know better than the &quot;experts&quot; that weld them open, 
remove them, etc.  If you press 'em beyond &quot;they're not needed&quot;, they say that
your engine will burn up when the 'stat fails.  Bull, they fail open.  Punch
one with a nail and see if you want.  Flaps stuck closed?  Don't leave your
engine out in the rain, and lubricate the rotation points with lithium grease
every time you pull the engine from the vehicle.  Rattles?  You're probably
missing the spacers.

As for the &quot;not needed&quot; part: sure, it'll run fine without them.  But your
cooling will be erratic and will cause the engine to take longer to warm up,
never warm up all the way, cool the wrong parts, etc.  At the least you
probably aren't going to see the same durability that you see in an engine
with a properly functioning thermostat assembly.

&gt; Since my old engines did not have them, I would like to have those parts to
&gt; make them work.  I have searched most sites and can not find them.  Best I
&gt; can find is the thermostat alone.

Best place to get the parts, cheap, is from a mechanic who advises against 
using them.  Truly.  I've been given complete setups before.  It pays to
be polite :-)  It's probably a good idea to buy a new thermostat, though.
Not so long ago you could get SVDA distributors for nearly free since the
009 was favored for so long.  The local VW joints around here have seemed to
notice the demand now, though, so the swaps are cheapest for 'em again.
