Subject: Was Fuel Gauge Q, Now Westy M-Codes

punkerbat_at_vbe_dot_com wrote:

 My M-codes are U23 and 382.  Maybe 382 was for a gas gauge?  I can't
find it
 anywhere...I thought maybe it was a &quot;package&quot; of m-codes as my bus has
6
 popouts, windshield washer setup, gas heater (probably dealer or
westfalia
 installed), and probably a couple of other things.  I think U23 is
the
 westfalia code as the bus is a SO-34 model.

and Clara replied:

ya- U23 does sound like a westy code.   I dunno what 382 is though.   
probably is a US spec package.   Maybe the U of U23 means the extras. 
I only 
remeber A, B, C, D westys.  Anyone up on westy codes?  Neat thing about
them 
is the westys often got a LOT of extra widgets

And I throw in:

382 is a &quot;North American&quot; spec package (lest we forget the Canadians).

The U23 would be for an SO-23 package, I believe, not the SO-34 model. 
Below is a listing of the alphabetic M-Codes I've accummulated in the
NEATO Registry.  Clearly it's not limited to ABCD.  Following each code
is the VIN for the bus(es) I found it on (low and high), followed by the
date it was manufactured and the quanity I've found with that code.
