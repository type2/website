Subject: gen problems

well...after trying 3 different voltage regulators today...the problem
was definitely in my generator.  New generator 40K ago...
I looked inside once the motor was out...and i had a loose post terminal
where the wires connect to go to the voltage reg or wiring
harness...whatever
there is a little wire inside that connects to the post.  It broke.  I
don't know how I'm going to fix this...but I will..

just thought I'd let you all know in case someone else was having the
same problem.

adios
