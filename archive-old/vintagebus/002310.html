Last year, I was on the 17-mile drive south of Monterrey and I stopped at a
rest area to take some photos. A vanagon synchro westy pulled up next to me
and a japanese guy and two girls got out. I struck up a conversation with
him only to find out that he buys and ships split window buses to Japan. He
has a sushi restaurant in Carmel, and exports splits on the side.
He said that the buyer pays the shipping and all costs related to importing
the vehicle into Japan. He just buys them on the west coast and posts photos
on websites like the one we're discussing here. When the money arrives, he
has the bus (or buses) loaded in containers and they're on their way to the
land of the rising sun. He wouldn't say what his typical margin is but he
did say that it paid well enough for him to lay out the cash in advance and
pay storage until the bus sold.
I'm thinking he's tripling (at least) his purchase price.
This really frosts my A$$, because it's the second time I've come up against
the Japanese collecting cool stuff. A few years ago I began buying pedal
airplanes and pedal cars when I could find them. Next thing I know, I'm
bidding against staggering figures at auctions for even marginal examples of
Pursuit Planes because the Japanese are using them to decorate shopping
malls...
now they're making repro's and in my opinion the appeal has gone out of the
pedal car hobby because anybody can buy a brand new one that's 99% identical
to the original.
Just my $.02 ( about 450 yen??)

&gt;
&gt; &gt; the funny part about that site is that some of those vehicles are not in
&gt; &gt; japan,   the green 48 split is the car i sold on ebay for jim anderson,
and
&gt; &gt; it is still in LA , and some of the shots look like california to me ???
&gt;
&gt; Maybe they like to get them sold before shipping to japn? that way maybe
&gt; the new owner will pay for shipping, or they will ahve the money to ship
&gt; it...
&gt;
&gt; Just a thought,
&gt;
&gt; Steve
