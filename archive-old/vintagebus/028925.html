I got me some high-speed Internet access so everettb_at_prodigy_dot_net gets dropped
in favor of my new email address:
everettb_at_thesamba_dot_com

I know each and every listee has me in their personal address book so please
perform an update.  ;)

Here's some stuff I need for my someday-soon-I'll-have-the-$$$$ restoration
of my US-delivered 1955 Barndoor Kombi:
1. Black Bakelite speedo dash face - NOS
2. 60 mph US speedometer - NOS or excellent
3. 6-leg middle seat, upholstery not necessary
   (Or back 1/2 of any pre-62 full-length seat)  Please?
4. Front bench seat bottom half
5. Outside front door handles - NOS
6. SIGLA front windshields, have Sekurit to trade
7. Cargo floor mat - 29A part #
8. English 1954 owner's manual - any readable condition
9. Any information or dealer materials from Competition Motors, Hollywood,
CA, would be appreciated.

Thank you very much for your time.
