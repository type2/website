Hello!

Ken and I have been working on a WWW full-text search version of the
list archives!  I just completed adding the vintagebus messages, and we
also have all of the type2 list archives from December 1996 on-line...

  http://www.i405_dot_com/vwarchive/

This search engine is a custom program, so it may be a bit different
from other searches you have used.  It is also still being worked on, so
it may have a few odd problems here or there.  Consider this early beta
computer program code, so try to tolerate the limits.

If you have any questions or problems, please direct them to my private
mail address.  Please, DO NOT POST questions or archive problems to the
mailing list...

Give it a try, and see if you can find the VW information you have been
seeking...
