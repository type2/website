&lt;&lt; as far as life span I will gladly go with the 3.88.  I drive mostly on 
flat ground as I live in Phoenix but i do occassionaly (every other month) 
make trips to SoCal.  &gt;&gt;
Hi Dan,
Then you probably will love the 3.875 or higher 3.44 R&amp;P freeway flier with 
.82 fourth.  If you do decide to get one make sure to ask us about the best 
gearing we have found.  So your new tranny has no gaps between the gears to 
make your driving an unhappy experience.  Eric&amp;Barb
