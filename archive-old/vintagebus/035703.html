 BTW: Will pre '64 front doors (refridgerator handle doors) fit on my '64?
 Are they a bolt up item, or is there something that is different besides the
 door handles? I know they won't be correct, but I'm trying to go for that
 'early' look.
 
 Thank you
 Charles &gt;&gt;

if you have an early 64 (buildt in 63) it came with the pull handles. 

if yours came with the push buttons, you can physically bolt a pull handle 
door on it, and find that the door mechanisms are totally different in 
addition to the handles, and do not mesh.

The later kind of door is better.  just leave it alone.  Appreciate your 
wonderful bus for being the bus it is, a bus with the push button handles.
