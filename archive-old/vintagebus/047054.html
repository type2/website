Subject: Re:  Early Commercial Interior Cab Door Handles

I can't remember if there was ever a thread on this, but I previously
searched the archives and couldn't find diddly.

Early commerical bus interior front cab door handles.  By early, I guess I
mean pre '62.  Since I've never owned a barndoor, I'm lost there.  Anyway, my
'60 Single Cab came to me with chrome ribbed door handles.  Very similar to
early Type 1 door handles, but seem to be slightly different.  Something
about the shape of the curve I think.  I also grabbed a set of these off of a
'58 Kombi in a salvage yard not too long ago.  Question is, are these
correct?  If so, what years were they correct?  I looked on the backside of
the handle and it appears to have a &quot;225&quot; stamped in it.  No other part
number that I can find.

Who has the light that can shed it on these?  TIA.

yes- these were used on all buses.   The change date was before mid april 61.
 may have been april 1st  61 when they changed the interior (o more cab door
pockets).     A May 59 bus I had had them.     early/mid 50s ones are a
cruder casting than later 50s.
