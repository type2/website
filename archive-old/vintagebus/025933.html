Hello Friends,

I got everything together tonight. Chased the redux threads with a tap.
Got the engine in, all hooked up. 

Now the problems that I have: Generator light on. It wasn't on before,
so I don't know why its on now. Sh*t. Also, skipping on #!. I'll figure
that one out...

Runs around the yard just great. I'm hoping this tranny will hold me for
a little while  till I get the old tranny straightened out...
