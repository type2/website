It cracks me up when we VW folks rave on about good old &quot;German&quot; steel. I
own a collection of Foreign Car Digest Magazines &lt;featuring VW's&gt; which
roughly covers 1960 through 1965 inclusive. Somewhere within this collection
there is an article or small blurb ala Reader's Digest style margin drivel
which gave a statistic concerning the amount of U.S.S. steel that was
exported to Germany for the production of the Volkswagens of that era. I
believe that at one point in time the United States was providing the
majority of the sheet steel. Unfortunately I dont think that I have the time
to glean through the five years of issues to find this quote. This sounds
like baloney but I was amazed as well. Possibly I can find the issue and
give a proper citation. A scan of the article would be possible at that time.
Conversely, I chuckle about the &quot;Buy American&quot; bias against the VW products
of that era based on the same quote.

I have been meaning to find this quote and fwd it to Everett Barnes' VW
Planet for the factoid banner. Another factoid is the I was born on the same
day that the millionth beetle was produced. 8/5/55
