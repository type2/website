 I was looking at the Wolfsburg West site because the E-brake boot is missing
 from my '60 Double Cab and it says the boots are from May, 1960 - up.
 
 Is this correct?  Earlier Buses have no E-brake boot?
  &gt;&gt;
61 and 60 buses have a metal ebrake boot that covers the unsightly ends of 
the ebrake cables.  The earlier buses (late 59 and back) have the unsightly 
ebrake cable ends unde rthe floor, and thus have no ebrake boots.
my parts list does say that 211 863 341 (rubber ebrake boot) was used from 
5/60 on.  However, I think this is crap. they did not start them a 614 456, 
but later, thought the metal part was superceded in the parts list.

generally on OG 61s, there is the metal ebrake boot
