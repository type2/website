&lt;&lt; Late night TV news showed footage from SoCal relating
 to the amount of rainfall on Thursday. Same storm is
 supposed to hit the Phoenix Metro area before daybreak
 Friday.
 
 Footage showed a white small window splittie flooded
 above the rockers while sitting in the lower level of
 a public parking garage. Does it happen to belong to a
 listee? Hopefully not...

iF Your bus gets flooded, change your gear oil.  It will have water in it.

Also, change your steering gear box oil.  it will also have water in it.

a friend found this out by assembling a bus that had been parked in a low 
field.  thus flooded part of the winter (seasonal wetland).  He put new trans 
boots on it and changed the trans oil.  half of what came out was water.  all 
well and good but next winter he tried to drive one morning and the steering 
wheel would not turn.  Lit a camp stove under to thaw out the box, then later 
drained and changed it- water came out.  Buses steering better with nice oil 
in the sgbox.
