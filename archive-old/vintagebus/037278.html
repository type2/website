Hi Volks,
Tar also has an incredible property to repel rust.  Which none of the other 
effective sealants will do.

&lt;&lt;Advice from the PNW folk as to how to keep your bus dry is coming from
more experience then most of us will have in a lifetime.&gt;&gt;
Even we found this out the hard way when moving from central Texas where I 
(Eric) had been in the USAF where I had found and put back on the road our 
1963 SC and KG both which never seemed to have a leak problem.  As soon as I 
got home to Washington State both VWs leaked with windshield rubber less than 
a year old in them.  Here we get not only rain/drizzle/sprinkles/mist for 
days on end, but weeks and even months without a let up.  The SC would just 
leak all over the dash, while the KG was much more insidious due to the 
factory type 1 primer drain holes under both the front and rear windows.  The 
front drains dripped just forward of the dash and allowed this water to leak 
down into the front door pillar where it soaked into the defroster heater 
tubes right on into the heater channels and out the lower front heater vents 
onto the floor.
  I painted a thin coat of roofing tar to the inner floor of the KG after 
wirewheeling and vaccuming out all the loose rust and installed many buses 
windows with roofing tar since then.  After two months there never is any 
oder of tar.
