does anyone know where to obtain a metal gas line from fuel pump to carb 
with the threaded fittings.  i have a 59 kombi and just replaced the fuel 
pump.  it was running for a minute then shut off.  sure enough quick fix,  
however the gas line at top connection to carb was off.  i put teflon tape 
around threads and helps for a bit.  ive asked all around portland or but no 
go.  discount said some mail orders have em but does anyone know where to 
get one fairly priced.  the line is distorted where the opening of the line 
fits at carb.

Nothin left to do but smile, smile, smile!!
