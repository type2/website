I purchased a set of elephant ear side mirrors from Latest Rage for $15 each and find them to be most excellent.  I figured since they are made in Tiawan they would be inferior to the Roscoe reproductions ($25 each), but honestly they look identical.  

They are not as tight as the original rear view mirror arms...  Then again I had to beat the beans out of the old one to get it out in the first place and I do not think I could have beaten anything new in that was that tight.  This is probably a neccessary evil.  The door does not sag because of it anyway...  Okay you caught me!  The door does not sag anymore than it usually does :)

Enjoy,
