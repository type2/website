&gt;&quot;There are a lot
&gt; more important things to worry about than to spend countless hours and
&gt; sleepless nights wondering if your vehicle is still sitting outside your
&gt; house...&quot;

I feel that after spending countless hours and sleepless nights getting the
thing together, I absolutely should be worried if it is still sitting outside
my house.  My Volkswagen is a very big chunk of who I am.  No insurance
settlement could ever cover my actual loss.

One opinion,
Dan Morris
