&gt; Tonight tried my first ever change of axle boots

John,

I just replaced mine a couple of months ago, and had no problems getting
the clamps around the boots.

The Type II guru at the local bug shop had a tip for me when I bought
the boots.  He said to make sure that the seam (where the small machine
bolts hold the flat mated rubber surfaces together) is horizontal, not
vertical.  He said that if you mount it with the seam vertically, the
boot does not flex as easily as it would if the seam were horizontal.
With the seam in this vertical orientation, the boot will eventually
fatigue and split due to the axle travel in the vertical direction.  He
claimed that leakage from the seam would not be a problem when oriented
horizontally, because the amount of tranny oil passing through the boot
is not enough to rise above the seam.

I mounted the boots with the seam facing horizontally, facing to the
rear of the bus, and haven't seen any leakage (well, at least not from
the boots.  I have lots of other leaks, but that's a different matter).

FWIW, YMMV, etc,
Russell
