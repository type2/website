Contact Dave Easterwood, whom I am copying this message to and he can get
you the info. He is not the guy that does membership, but he can probably
get you a sample newsletter and you can get what you need from it. Yes, as I
understand it the website will be put back up, but why wait for that? Join
and get the newsletters coming.

&gt; How does one go about joining NEATO now that their website has ceased to
&gt; exist? The site was starting to be pretty good and then financial
&gt; responsibilities made them pull the plug. Does anybody know if they plan
to
&gt; put a site back up?
