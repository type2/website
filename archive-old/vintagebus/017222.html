Regarding large metric wing nuts, I looked in 2
catalogs that I have of industrial supplies, etc., and
found them listed in many sizes, so somewhere out
there they are available.

MSC (www.mscdirect_dot_com) has a 4000+ page catalog of
interesting stuff, and shows metric wing nuts M10, 12,
16, 20 and 24 diameters, and smaller sizes are also
available.  M10x1.5 are $120.32 for 100 of them, and
larger ones are of course more expensive.

Fastenal (www.fastenal_dot_com) with branches in many
larger cities, lists 10-1.5 and 12-1.75 as their
largest sizes, no price in my catalog, but they say
they will sell less than full package (25 in a
package).  Check phone books for nearest Fastenal
branch. 

Hope this helps.
