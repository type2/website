Subject: For the record: &quot;new&quot; king pin tolerance makes it difficult to
  grease

Hi,

So, after getting off the phone with Walt at Bus Boys, apparently when 
the King Pin and Bushing clearance is per factory specification .006&quot; 
(0.15 mm) that it IS difficult to grease the king pin, and that you 
probably won't see much if any grease come out of the rubber seal.

The part to watch as Ted Smith pointed out to me is to make sure that 
the hole in the brass bushing is open to the zerk hole. Walt says these 
can wander, and sometimes do. I should check that also after some use. 
Take the zerk out, clean out the hole and look for the hole in the 
brass bushing. I'm assuming that if the tolerance between the king pin 
and bush is too tight, this will cause the bushing to wander.

Grease 'em up, get 'em on.

Conrad
