&gt; Hey All,
&gt; In the 64 Campmobile I just picked up, I have found a couple of items that may interest someone out there.  One is an original blue-print style instruction sheet for the drive away tents that came with this model, all written in German and very cool.  The size is approximately 8&quot;x10&quot;  The other is the tri-fold brochure type instructions for the tents (there are instructions for a small and a large tent) with instructions written in both german and english.  I do not have the tents for the bus, so I thought someone who had the complete set-up and a show bus may want these things to complete their collection.  I have no idea what these would be worth, if anything, to anyone so i am just going to say that I will trade them for parts.  I have a 66 EZ-Camper?, 64 Campmobile, and an 83 Westy.  If you have any parts for these and want to trade for the tent literature, let me know.  I can send pix.
