Subject: Clarafying the bus rims post...

I seemed to create some confusion. I do know for a fact that the 15&quot; bus
wheels are 4.5&quot; wide. It is stamped in the front and I measured one. The
14&quot; bus wheels are at least 5&quot; wide, I can't remember if they are 5&quot; or
5.5&quot; wide but either one would get me in the ballpark. I don't NEED the
extreme load range of the D rated Continental but I figure the stiffness
would be good down here in our severe winds. I do want something that is
over 1400lbs load range. I really don't want to go to the 14&quot; wheels as
I have finally put together a complete set of 58 Crows foot wheels for
my early 60 Double Cab.
Still looking for that perfect combo,
Craig
