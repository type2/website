&gt; &gt;Watch out or I'll do it I swear... If I can't find someone in the Boston,
MA area
&gt; &gt;to paint my 64 standard I am going to take it to...Maa**co.. An I'll make
&gt; &gt;sure to get it painted with some metalic honda color... I swear... just
watch me
&gt; &gt;or maybe... rattle..rattle..rattle?
&gt; &gt;cheers,
&gt; &gt;-rob

Your maacos, your miracles, your schiebs...
these guys do more complete resprays than anybody. Your big time body shops
would rather
spray replacement fenders on modern cars than paint a complete vehicle.
Complete resprays are the bargain  guy's bread and butter. It's all they do
all day. I took a bug
to get resprayed at Miracle because a *real* body shop botched the first
spray.
They even filled a hole for almost nothing. If the prep is
good, it can turn out beautiful....just gotta spend more than $99.99  ;)
