&gt;     if they are close to fitting, but not just quite... then there are
&gt; probably a few burrs or ridges of metal that must be filed down to allow the

&gt; installed relative to the axle splines... it may just happen to want to go on
&gt; in a certain position.

No such luck, and there are no obvious burrs or ridges on the splines in
the drums or axle.

&gt;     compare your old drum to the new one to make sure that all critical
&gt; dimensions are the same. height, diameter, etc...

As far as I can measure, they're very close. Obviously not quite right
though.

&gt;     (make doubly sure that the drum is not hitting the brake shoes... this is
&gt; the most common reason as to why drums won't immediately go back on...)

Nope, they won't go on nearly that far. The dums make it about 1/4&quot; - 1/2&quot;
onto the axle and then stop completely. They slide that first bit with
basically no effort, but won't budge any further.

&gt;     removing the offending metal is a painstaking process that involves a tiny
&gt; file, and eyeballing the axle splines and drum splines and seeing where the
&gt; interference is.

I'm attempting this, but it's basically impossible to tell where it is
hanging up. Any suggestions on how to tell what is catching?

&gt;     once you have that out of the way... be sure to use some anti-seize on the
&gt; splines. it is a real pain to remove the drum later on when it is rusted solid
&gt; to the axle.

I'll definitely do that......
