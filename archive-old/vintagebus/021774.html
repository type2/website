Hi Chet,
Beware!  Unless you can get proof it has only 65,000 miles on it, best to 
figure it has alot more milage on it.

&lt;&lt;Is it possible to put my RGB's and old axles (or new one's if they're bent) 
on that transmission, or should I just remove the RGB's altogether?&gt;&gt;
Yes, you can install the RGBs, but the bug tranny used a .89 fourth gear 
instead of the bus/Ghia .82 fourth gear.  Which results in a five MPH slower 
tranny in fourth gear.  Removing the RGBs will lower the rear end so you will 
have to lower the front end.  Which will cost $$ and time to do 
correctly/safely.

 &lt;&lt; Were Bug and Bus transmissions the same, with the Bus having reduction 
gears to compensate for the wieght and hauling capacity? &gt;&gt;

The bus, bug &amp; Ghia tranny center sections were the same most years (1959-60 
bus had just gotten the tunnel case tranny when the bug/Ghia still had the 
split case tranny until 1961.) except for gearing.  The bus RGBs with thier 
four bearing per side instead of the type 1 &amp; 3s one per side, were 
definitely to help deal with the heavier bus body and the much larger/heavier 
cargo capacity.  The type 1 maximum load in 1965 was 837Lbs. (380KG) and if 
memory serves correctly the type 3 was about the same amount.  These are only 
a little over half of the bus 1955-63 3/4 ton suspension and the 1963 one ton 
option which became standard for 1964-67 was even more robust.  Plus the type 
1 &amp; 3 rear brakes are far smaller weaker than the bus 1955-67 rear brakes.
