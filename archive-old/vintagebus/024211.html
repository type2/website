I am interested in getting some opinions on whether the following
symptoms
could all be head related.

The rebuild I put in Sunshine the '64 Westy in March has had consistent
problems maintaining valve adjustment.  All the valves were consistently
tight at maintenance intervals that have ranged from 300 miles to 2800
miles.  Additionally, the head nuts have consistently loosened, but not
necessarily in as short a time.

These problems reached a point yesterday where the rocker is bottomed
out on the valve stem so that with the adjuster backed off all the way,
there is still no gap.  My review of the archives indicates that I
should have
somewhere around half of the adjusters' range available.  In my 26 years
of VW exposure to about a dozen different engines in four busses and
three
bugs, I have never had one that had the adjusters backed out as far as
on
this one, nor one that had the valves go out of adjustment so quickly. 
On
Sunshine, I had to replace the engine she came with after two years due
to a cracked case which I believe was symptomatic of deeper problems,
since I had to use a Sand Seal to get the pulley to stop leaking.  The
engine I put in in 1985, gave me no problems till early this year when I
burnt a valve and started burning oil on #4, leading to the installation
of the current engine.  Now at 8500 miles and six months with the new
engine, it seems in worse potential shape than the one it replaced.

I'll be calling the rebuilder today to give them a chance to make this
right, so I am not inclined to name them at this time, but I'll keep the
list posted on the outcome.

Thanks a lot,
