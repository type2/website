So it looks like a Rancho Transmission is everybody's favorite tranny,
Right?

I will be putting one in the 64 Single cab &quot;big nut&quot; soon and wanted to get
the list opinion, I do very little freeway travel, mostly around town, so I
should go with a stock set up, not a freeway flier, right?

I think my redux boxes are good and have had no problem but was wondering if
I should go ahead with the turn key tranny, rebuilt tranny with the redux
boxes attached?

Also does any one have any wheel wells for the 64? How about some Rockers,
both sides! Treasure Chest Doors?

And if any one had noticed I stopped giving updates on my 64 SC Resto, it's
because I had a wreck in my 72 and that kept me from working on it with the
same intensity.

Thanks Everyone, I hope you all have a great Holiday Season.
Meredith Murray
