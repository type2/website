Subject: Re: [VB] LONG 1st jerome trip

&gt; ... was interesting. from the tales i had heard, it was neither as
&gt; family-oriented nor as crazed as i had been led to believe. not sure
&gt; which was worse!
&gt;... not only did i get to listen to inept bongo
&gt; playing, the words DUDE SH*T and F*CK used as a sentence, and his
&gt; opinions on music, i ALSO was privileged to hear his preferences on
&gt; 'bitches' and their techniques: how he likes it when he's full
&gt; throttle and they holler HARDER, and how he prefers his oral
&gt; pleasures........

Sounds like the guy we were camped across from last year-sorry I missed
camping by him again, &amp; you had to get him on your first visit to Jerome!
&gt; 
&gt; would i go again? dunno - i found most of the crowd standoffish and
&gt; cliquish -.......

Volks tend to hang w/ people they know-Unless you are really outgoing &amp; make
an effort, it might seem like volks are standoffish or cliquish. I
think/have walked into many groups where you don't know a soul, &amp; have
developed new friends almost every time.  Bill in Melvan-the bumper sticker
bus, picked up a homeless looking hitchhiker &amp; brought him to Jerome. The
guy camped in the dirt under a tent trailer, became part of the group, so
much so that the group pitched in to buy him 20-30 bucks worth of raffle
tickets so he could be part of the fun- turns out he won the Koch steering
wheel certificate, which he had auctioned off to someone who needed it, &amp;
walked out of the Jamboree w/ $100 +- in his pocket, &amp; the impression that
Volks are the friendliest/most laid back people he had ever run into.

 since i finally met beto and his
&gt; family i will likely bring my family up next year...

Sorry I missed you- I was camped w/ Beto's/Fu's/JP/Rachel/Laffoon/etc. Group
also.

The Fu's/Pina's went way over the top buying/preparing/cooking for anybody
that wanted to eat!

 and if the abc 
&gt; has it later in the cooler part of the  month, my wife might even
&gt; agree to  another year!

The event was actually not that hot this year in the shade-it can be a lot
hotter &amp; a lot cooler depending on the year.  &quot;SHADE, SHADE, SHADE IS GOOD&quot;
at Jerome, to parody Clara a tad.

Trip report to follow,
