A friend of mine called yesterday after seeing my split camper in the
driveway.
He said &quot;Hey John, you should come down to where I work and see the VW
bus that we have&quot;. Fool that I am, I went almost immediately, my friend
Brian works in a Charter Bus company as a maintenance mechanic. At his
garage, pushed sideways into a corner and buried under and behind bus
(big bus) tires and parts sits a shortened (this is painful) kombi. I
couldn't see all of it but what I saw is this: bullet signals in front,
small rear window, round taillights...trouble is, somebody thought it
would be &quot;cool&quot; to chop the center section out of this bus. Nine years
ago it was pushed into this corner, shortened but complete (it
supposedly ran when it was parked). Interior is crap, stacked with
parts, exterior is crap (poorly repaired rust) and it's prone to doing
wheelies...
I told him I would give him a couple of hundred for it and haul it out,
i figure the parts are worth that much, but damn, this would have been a
real find for me if it was unmolested.
-John
