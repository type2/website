&gt; Hi Glynn,
&gt; Go with the 1965 unit.  Replacing the hockey stick is easy.  Hopefully it
has
&gt; the later 4.125 R&amp;P, and 24% reduction boxes.  Instead of the 1960-63
4.375
&gt; R&amp;P, and 28% reduction boxes.  Though before installing the 1965 tranny
you
&gt; really should install a late 1964-67 front suspension to keep the braking
&gt; bias correct to prevent doing spins down the road when the pavement is
slick
&gt; while panic stopping.  Plus installing the later braking system will
increase
&gt; your stopping power by about 20%, and it will feel more like 50%.

eek!  i get what your saying about brake bias an all - just a little too
much to be getting my head round right now -- this darn garbox problem is
throwing me a spinner as it is.  :)

Righto
fetched the 65 gearbox last night..  tale again was stuck to that it came
out in the 60s..  if thats should give me any confidence eh?

but it aint got all its brake bits --  the gearbox is there-- and now i
understand the hockey stick comes out easilly enough... so no grief there.
like wise nose cones should be okay to swop over for the front mount yes?

_but_ no brakes (just backing plates) and its been mentioned (ta john) about
needing to use later cables and shorten them with cable clamps. -- is this
because the axles are different lengths? or just the ends of the cables
different?...  either way i could be heading for dangerous ground because
i'm running alloys with tall tyres and not much room at all to play with.

so - assuming the seller is right in that its a 36mm axle nut - which is
what i've got now. and its a 65 but mine is a 60 -  can i swop all the brake
parts...  drums, cables, cylinders, adjusters, and shoes, even the backing
plates over to the 65 with no problems?  or is this impossible?  if
impossible i'm looking at a search for the either the same year trans or new
brake parts for the 65 which'd then make this a very expensive do..  as i've
only recently replaced my 60 brakes.  eek!

axle length etc - is there a difference? prolly me heading down the wrong
path eh.

any advice on this lot please - very appriciated --  my head hurts! :(

fun innit?  :)
