Speaking of Solvang, anyone from Southern CA going up?  Myself and the
family are leaving in the 62 double cab late friday morning.   This will be
interesting since my wife is 8 months pregnant.  Hope those new shocks
smooth out the ride some.  I think we'll bring lots of pillows.

It'd be nice to go in a group, though we might slow people down since the
doc said no more than an hour  driving at a time for the little lady.
Planning on lunch in Santa B too.
