You can use the tranny with your old RGB's *BUT* (and this is an Oprah Winfrey
butt) you *must* flip the ring gear - otherwise you'll have 4 gears in reverse
and one forward.

&gt; they're bent) on that transmission, or should I just remove the RGB's 
&gt; altogether?  Were Bug and Bus transmissions the same, with the Bus having 
&gt; reduction gears to compensate for the wieght and hauling capacity?  Happy
