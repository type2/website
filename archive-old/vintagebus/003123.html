The gene pool doesn't have a lifeguard.

&gt; My other question is about the 2nd generation of the type 2.  I'm a
&gt; little worried for a good friend of mine who likes to drive his type 2
&gt; with the rear hatch all the way open and way up above the bus.  It's
&gt; the back door that is hinged on the top used for loading and
&gt; unloading.  Particularly in the summer.  I'm worried he and his whole
&gt; fammily will get carbon monoxide poisoning or something.  He couldn't
&gt; care less, with an attitude that it only happens to others.
