&lt;&lt; someone sent me a link for jet coat that seems like it would withstand the
 heat, but since another list member brought it up, I was wondering if this
 would be a good idea on heater boxes.  do they need to be able to dissapate
 heat when you have the heater off?  am I miss understanding how it works? &gt;&gt;

Hi Ronnie,
The fresh air heating system has valve type vents on the backside of the 
front heads of the fresh air heat exchangers.  So coating the outside shell 
should not affect cooling as long as these vents are not obstructed.  We use 
type 3 heat exchanger insulation blankets on our type 1&amp;2 heat exchangers 
with no noticable increase of oil temp during the summer months.  Probably 
not a good idea to coat the insides of the heat exchangers though!  Since 
this would reduce the heat exchange and keep the exhaust gas too hot which 
causes too much exhaust back pressure and higher oil temps.
  For stale air heat exchangers we like to weld fins made up from banding 
strap material for more outer cooling surface and using an insulating coat 
inside or outside these exhaust tubes would again adversely affect the 
exchange of heat and cause higher oil temps.
  Not sure, but we think coating the muffler would be fine.  Still would be 
nice to get tests doen between coated and no-coated mufflers on the same 
engine during simular weather conditions.
  If we won the lotto it would be fun to have stock heads insulated coated 
inside the chambers and exhaust passages to reduce the transfer of the hot 
exhaust gases into the head material and this should lower the oil temps 
especially during the summer.
