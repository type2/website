Subject: Season for Heater boxes or Don't freeze your bird... &lt;friday&gt;

An oldie but a goodie:

A Vintage Nazi named Jon received a parrot as a gift. The parrot had a bad
attitude and an even worse vocabulary. Every word out of the bird's mouth
was rude; obnoxious; promoted Petronix dizzys, hydraulic valves, usage of
radiator water cooling; and laced with profanity. 
Jon tried and tried to change the bird's attitude by consistently saying
only polite words, playing soft music and anything else he could think of
to &quot;clean up&quot; the bird's vocabulary. 
Finally Jon was fed up and he yelled at the parrot. The parrot yelled
back. Jon shook the parrot and the parrot got even angrier and more rude.
Jon in desperation, threw up his hands and grabbed the bird and put him in
the freezer. 
For a few minutes the parrot squawked and kicked and screamed. Then,
suddenly there was total quiet, not a peep was heard. Fearing that he hurt
the parrot, Jon quickly opened the door to the freezer. 
The parrot calmly stepped out onto Jon's outstretched arm and said I
believe I may have offended you with my rude language and actions. I am
sincerely remorseful for any inappropriate transgressions. I fully intend
to do everything I can do to correct my rude and unforgivable behavior&quot;. 
Jon was stunned at the change in the bird's attitude. He was about to ask
the parrot why he had made such a dramatic change in his behavior, but the
bird continued...&quot;May I ask what the chicken did?&quot;

Enjoy OCTO everybody! I *REALLY* wish that I could be there. =)
