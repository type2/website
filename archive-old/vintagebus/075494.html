Try a real hardware store.  http://www.type2_dot_com/archive/vintagebus/043507.html
Even if they don't have it, they can often give you a short list of
places that will have it.

&gt;Anyone else know of a source for the backward threaded &quot;heim&quot; joint
&gt;pictured.

This place seems to have them with metric left hand threads, but they
have a hole in the ball instead of the stud:

Have you tried asking EMPI?  I'm sure you're not the first person to
only need one piece off a carb linkage.
