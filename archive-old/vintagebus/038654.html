&gt; I've been thinking about adding a second speaker to my single cab so I can get
&gt; my favorite tunes in stereo....

Hi George,
When I bought my '57 SC the PO had placed speakers in the well behind the
seat.  These were small bookshelf type and just sat down there in the
original boxes.  The sound was great then and with the advancement in
speaker technology it should be fantastic now.  He ran the speaker wires
under the floor mat so there was no alteration to the body.  I kind of like
the bass speaker under the seat.  Same in my MR-2.  The PO on my Westy hung
speakers under the tray and put the bass behind the drivers seat.  That
works too but I may change the speakers under the tray for something
smaller.

If it's worth doing, it's worth doing
yourself.
