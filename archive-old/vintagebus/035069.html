Subject: bench-seat frame restoration
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

Hey guys-
Today, It was a beautiful day in Peoria, IL so I decided I'd start my seat 
frame resto. My frame is actually in great shape, it just needed a bit of 
surface rust taken care of. I broke out the Dremel (just got one for 
Christmas) and went to town. Caution! This takes FOREVER! If I had to do it 
again I would sandblast. Why??? Seat frames are very hard to get completely 
rust free by hand--There are many tight crevices I just couldn't get to. 
Overall, the job was done well, but not perfect. I don't know what I wouldv'e 
done without my Dremel? I've still got the backrest part to do but they looks 
to be much more straight-forward. Any tips for finishing it off?

Thanx for listening
