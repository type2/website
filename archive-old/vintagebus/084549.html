Subject: speedometer cable relpacement

The speedo just broke in my 63 singlecab and I am having problems.
The cable that I just got is about 2 inches too short, maybe 1 if I really pull.
Are there different lengths and How do I find out what I have done wrong?
Unfortunately I just pulled out the old one and threw it away so I can't check the new one for length.
Maybe the bus one is a couple of inches longer than the beetle &amp; thing one. How do I check?
I cannot see how the cable was threaded in the area underneath the front floor around the pedals. I stupidly pulled out the old cable.
I did just get a set of ramps so it is much easier working under the front of the bus, but this is frustrating.
 
BTW I found out that a wire clothes hanger straightened out and poked up through the hole in the front is the only way to get the cable threaded, with electrical tape holding the speedo cable to the wire coat hanger.
