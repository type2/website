Absolutely.

&gt; i fully understand that it couldve been damaged before they got or on thier 
&gt; shelf
&gt; but still thier has to be some quality control of whats shipped to customers.

No, from the looks of it, it was munged before it was rebuilt.  From the 
information I'm getting, Bus Boys doesn't actually rebuild the box themselves, 
but buys them from a 3rd party.  Still, they should have checked something
as basic as the threads.

The local VW shop told me about installing a lowering kit on a pickup a couple
of weeks ago, where the bearing cup (?) was rusted and pitted badly - unusable.
They sent another out right away, and guess what?  It was equally unusable.
The customer ended up getting his own in junkyard, but the supplier wouldn't
credit him for the unusable part.
