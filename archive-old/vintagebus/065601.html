Subject: Honda Element / was New Toyota...

I am all over that Honda Element as well. It is the closest I have seen
to VW bus usefulness in a long time. Ellis said:&quot;I like the Scion CCX or
whatever it is called but rename the boxy second offering as &quot;maxfugly&quot;.
If I wanted stark engineering and boxy looks then I'd go for the old-old
school Land Rover Dormo, the Land Cruiser F55 &quot;Pig&quot; or the 86-91 VW
Vanagon Synchro all done up in overly outfitted SA Expedition equipment.
Each to their own. I concede...&quot;  It is ugly but...our busses are a
learn to love shape as well. The cool thing is they put utility above
looks. I am 6' 2&quot; and can sleep in the back of the Element, it has a
diamond plate rubber mat that runs the full length of the rig, it is a
walk thru, the back seats fold up against the wall or remove easily, it
is offered in 4 wheel drive, it gets 26 miles per gallon and fully
decked out it is right around $20,000 (the base model is like 16). The
other cool thing is by making it a &quot;BOX&quot;, the outside of the thing is
about the size of a Subaru Forester but the inside is bigger than alot
of these stupid SUV's running around. First really smart car I have seen
in a while. I also picture it with genuine simulated wood grain panels
stuck on the side to cheese it up a bit. I saw one of these in person at
a ski show last week.
Just my thoughts,
