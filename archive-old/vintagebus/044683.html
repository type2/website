I can not believe that most of &quot;The Vintage Bus&quot; listees think that you can
cut your way to a different model bus. If I saw what was advertised to be a
sunroof model bus, and I went to look at it, I would be real PISSED. Even if
the man selling it didn't do the butch, he got tricked and that is not fair to
him or any bus lover now halfways interested in his rig. I know alot of you
get down on me because of how my bus sits, but if you wanna know, the gravity
challenged bus of mine needs a roof BAD. It seems to me that someone along
time ago &quot;fixed&quot; the roof by adding fiberglass resin to the drip rail, now the
roof is so bad I can sit on the back seat and push the roof off almost! I will
fix this, but you know what I am going to put on the top of my kombi? Another
Kombi roof, and as a matter of fact, a correct year roof. My only mods are
bolt on. Alot of you would love to find an NOS Okrassa kit, but to use this
you will have to destroy more than what I have done. The sunroof will look
more stock than the the tranny alterations, but the roof won't be on the m#
plate, and it is really hard to undo, whereas the tranny can be changed in
under 8 hours.
  
Now to reply to some of your questions and comments:

Jack Maynard wrote the following: ..... we shouldn't act like they are sacred.

I reply: Jack, they are very sacred to me.
 
and Matt wrote:  If someone transplants a roof, there's a very good chance
a bus came from the factory that way.  We've all seen a factory sunroof
Kombi's, but there's never been a lowered bus from the factory.
 
I reply:  Again, it is in the #'s. You could get a sunroof, but when you get
that, they take these little plates and stamp the option # in it. The plate is
located on the bulkhead behind the passenger seat. And the buses never left
the factoy with a Sundial interior (no offense to Sundial people). Or what
about the Gandy Wagen that was in the 2nd to last OBR, that is not &quot;VW&quot; but
very acceptable. Aftermarket stuff is always going to be around, everyone
likes Hurst Bumpers, Aftermarket Roof Racks, EMPI steps, Helphos spotlights,
Engine kits, and believe it or not Bus boys Safaris will someday be sought
after. I just think that whatever you do, it should be really easy to change
back, or you wanna be buried in it. 
 
Matt also said: Sorry to rehash the lowered bus thread, but there's only so
much I can take
from the DKB's before something needs to be said.
 
I reply:  What in fact did the DKB's say that hurt your feelings? Attacking
the chapter is not fair and was uncalled for. The DKB's didn't say one thing,
I did. Das Kool Bullis is a club that promotes driving your bus, no one gets a
sticker/magnet unless they daily drive there bus, and are a hardcore
enthusiast. And there are all kinds of stock and non stock buses in the club,
come and see next Saturday. And as per Thom, I didn't mention the &quot;L word&quot; one
time, you guys did!
