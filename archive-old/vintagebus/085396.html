Subject: No fire from coil

My bus:

1969 1600 SP,

is not my daily driver but my RV. I went to start it a few weeks ago and she
had a dead battery. Figured I would charge it or get a new one no big deal.
Last week put the battery booster and she turned right over but would not fire
up. Since my dizzy has always been a trouble spot I replaced points and
condenser. Still hooked to the battery booster, turns over just fine, no joy.

Today was the first time I had the time to trouble shoot it and again hooked
up the booster and looked for fire at the coil by removing the connection at
the dizzy and looking for spark grounded it the shroud. No spark. Went to
flaps and bought a new coil. Replaced and still no spark. Next step was to run
a wire from the positive terminal of battery to the pos side of coil. Horn
starts honking so have power. Disconnected annoying horn. Still no spark from
the coil. Coil wire? Replaced it with another used one. Still no spark.

So I either have two bad coil wires or a coil bad out of the box.

She is hooked up to the battery charger right now is not taking the charge, so
this is one dead battery.

Any ideas? Camping season is upon me with no crusty bus to drive.

Having a bad day. The ignition switch was also bad so I replaced it before I
did the above and it worked just fine. - For about 20 engine starting
attempts. It broke that fast. Where should I buy a good one?

Thanks for any help with this problem.

Ric
