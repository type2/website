Subject: Re: [VB] &quot;icepick&quot; door handles

yes, there is a spring.

to replace the spring, remove the handle - Phillips screws in door jamb.   be 
careful not to mush them as it is easy to do.  Turn the handle over and see 
the remants of teh spring.

then see the pin that holds the pick to the handle rectangle?   If the handle 
was in the door it stands verticle.  you have to drive that out with a hammer 
and punch.  

The early handles for flat (nov 60 and earlier) doors has a diff rectangle 
base than the later ones.  theu also have different springs for the early &amp; 
late bases, so you need to get the right spring.   Dunno about sources.  

Reassemble with grease.

&lt;&lt; The &quot;icepick&quot; style door handles on my beloved bus flop outward as I 
drive, the
 doors don't pop open but it creates a minor impalement hazard to pedestrians 
and
 cyclists. I think perhaps there was some kind of spring in there that is now
 unsprung, but would someone please enlighten me before I take something apart
 that I might have a hard time getting back together again...? And the part 
that
 is missing or broken or worn, is a replacement available?
 
 Other notes: The ratwagen turned 39 this weekend, climbed a 9,628 foot pass, 
26%
 grade in second gear. No better bus, that's what I say.
