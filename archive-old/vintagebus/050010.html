Subject: Re: [VB] Starting a bus without a key


&gt;There is a 1969 bus for sale at a very low price in my area( clear title).
&gt;Beacuse of major problem with our family car I might be cheaper to by this
&gt;bus then get the volvo fixed.
&gt;
&gt;The bus ran ok when last parked  over a year ago but the key has been lost.
&gt;I want to go look  over the bus and see about buying it but I really want to
&gt;get it started while I am there.
&gt;
&gt;Can a bus be started and driven with the key in the off position. The owner
&gt;reports that if there is a steering wheel lock is does not work so that is
&gt;not an issue. Any adivce in the matter would be greatly appreciated.



Here's how:  Jump a wire from the supply side of any fuse which has voltage
with the ignition off (like the headlights) to the supply side of any fuse
which only has voltage with the ignition on (like the wipers).  This will
have the same effect as turning the key to the 'on' position.  To start the
bus, either push-start it (in 2nd gear, not 1st), or block the wheels, put
it in neutral, and crawl underneath and jump from the battery cable
terminal on the starter to the spade terminal (which is wired to the
'start' position of the ignition switch).  You may need a helper to operate
the throttle while you crank the starter.  I don't recommend getting pulled
over by the police with this arrangement...

Kabayo

P.S. If you don't intend to drive the bus, but only run the engine, you can
just jump from the positive battery terminal to the hot side of the coil.
This may not give power to wipers, brake lights, and other accesories.
