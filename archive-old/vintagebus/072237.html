&gt; Does anyone out there have advice on shipping front doors?

Hi Paul,
First it would help to know from where to where the shipping is going.  If 
same continent you could contact the vintagebus list and see if anyone is 
going that way!!!  Also Greyhound here in the USA is quite reasonable for 
shipping larger objects.
