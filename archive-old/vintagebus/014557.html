&lt;&lt; Well, I had a breakdown on the way to busses by the arch, luckily I was
still in front of my house in Minneapolis! It turns out that one of the arms
on the clutch/throwout bearing operating broke off leaving me with no clutch
and a horrible grinding sound. The next day I pulled the engine all by myself
with the aid of a jack, 2x4 and a skateboard.  I'm replacing the clutch,
pressure plate, control arm, bearing and tranny seal. Any other &quot;Must do's&quot;
while the engine is on the bench? Also, what
 is the best spline lube? Any helpful hints for re installing? &gt;&gt;
Hi Tim,
Those pressed together and spot welded clutch arms are a real trouble spot.
Suggest you find a off road heavy duty welded style or take one of the spot
welded clutch arms and weld around the base of the arms to reinforce them.
Best to do two or more at a time so you have spares for the future.  When
installing the clutch arm make sure it ends up holding the throw out bearing
evenly to either side of the tranny input shaft.  We have had to shim the
clutch arms to center the throw out bearing on some of our VWs.  Any type of
grease will work on the splines, just make sure you wipe off any excess till
you leave just a film.  Also make sure you apply a thin layer of grease
anytime you reinstall the engine on the last inch of the tip of the tranny
input shaft.  Applying grease here will automaticly grease the needle bearings
in the flywheel gland bolt.  Without those needle bearings the clutch disc
will wobble around and cause havoc with your shifting.    Eric &amp; Barb
