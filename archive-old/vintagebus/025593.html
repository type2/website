&gt; &lt;&lt; Hi everyone. I have a '63 deluxe. Do I need to add a voltage drop to the
&gt; clock in order for it to work? Thank you! &gt;&gt;
&gt; Hi Derrick,
&gt; If you have a 1963 bus then you most likely have a 6 volt wiper motor.  What
&gt; you might want to do is to put a resistor before the wiper switch, and at the
&gt; same time wire the clock to this resistor.  This way you should be able to
&gt; two jobs with resistor.

This will NOT provide 6V to the clock.  You will get 12V unless the wiper motor
is on and then the voltage will be around 6V.  It does not have to do with wiring
the resistor before the switch, it has to do with ohms law.    You cannot do do
jobs with one resistor.  If it is wired that way and working, then the clock is
able to function on 12V (or something very near that) as E&amp;B mentioned.

I respectfully submit:

The voltage dropped across the resistor is a function of current drawn  V = I * R

The motor draw much more current than the clock.
Lets say the motor draws 5 amps and the clock 0.5 amp.  In order to drop the
voltage by 6V and provide the wipers with 6V, the V in the equation above = 6.
We know I =5, solving for R
R = V/I   R = 6/5   R = 1.2 ohms.

Now we use this same resistor to power the clock without the motor being on.
We know that the clock I is 0.5 amps and R = 1.2 ohms
To solve for the new voltage drop across the resistor,
V = I * R, V = 0.5 * 1.2, V = 0.6V   That is a 0.6V drop across the resistor,
leaving the remaining voltage for the clock.
12V - 0.6V = 11.4V to the clock.

All that said, I do not have an answer for you for your original question, if you
need a voltage drop resistor or not.  What E&amp;B said about the clock being a
mechanical clock with an electric winder makes sense and I have heard that
before.  That being the case, the pulse provided by the 12V rather than 6V serves
to pull the mechanical arm that much quicker and since the input voltage is not
used to regulate timing, it is very possible that these clocks will run on 6V -
12V.

Would a tech page with text, diagrams, voltage regulators  and alternatives be a
helpful item?  I could put one together when I get back after July 4th if the
need is determined.

Scott
