Subject: Re: [VB] Removing broken tap from chassis rail

From: VeeWee111_at_aol_dot_com
&gt;  Best thing when tapping is to prevent locking up the tap in the hole in
the
&gt; first place.  This requires the use of tapping fluid or at least a good
oil.
&gt; Most of all, when tapping to remember to turn in one turn and just over a
&gt; half turn back out and keep repeating this till the tapping is complete.

I think he was using grease instead of oil - that probably didn't help.

I have never heard of those tap removers, I guess I will have to pop to the
engineering supplies store on Monday to see if they have some.  If not the
method of breaking it up will work - it is HSS and he managed to break off
portions of it trying to knock it round.

Thanks
Paul
