 I brought home a '67 Dormobile on 04/01/00. It is primer white, but there
 are places that are peeling and places that were missed where other paint is
 showing through. Previous owner says the color I am finding is the origianl
 color. I am in love with the color and wish to repaint the bus. However, I
 can not seem to find the paint codes ANYWHERE... Here is ecaxtly how my
 M-Code plate looks:
 
 01D
 139    181
 430    056    080    091    119    121
 
     2312    523654    7066060
 
  &gt;&gt;

does your bus have speedo in KM/two tonetaillights/euro headlights?  I think 
430 is us specs but not clear, you have no port code, meaning it was sold in 
Germany.
DO you still have the Eberspacher and does it work?  sounds like a stylee 
ride.
