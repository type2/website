&gt; &lt;&lt; As I recall you can use a block of wood or drift on the back of the

&gt; Hi John,
&gt; That will work well for just the bearing almost all of the time, but it is a 
&gt; good idea to get the spacer off first and risk less heavy damaging hammering 
&gt; by a virgin.  Eric&amp;Barb
Definitely one thing at a time is enough to work against. 
On my old splitcase and my new small nut the bearings were on pretty
tightly though.
