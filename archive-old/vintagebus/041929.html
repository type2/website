&gt; I have a 1600 dp that came out of a 1971 beetle(prolly 20 years ago) It has

There should be a curved duct that goes through the hole in the tin and
draws air from the cylinder finning at the back of the engine.  A
paper/foil hose clamps to this and to your air cleaner.

It sounds like your duct is missing, so you'll have to scrounge one up!
