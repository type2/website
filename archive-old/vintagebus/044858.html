Hi Ronnie,
Not sure if you mean an oxy/accelerene torch kit.  If it is be carefull!  
While it might be a good buy it might also be a dead end purchase.  A 
relative of ours bought a set of tanks with torch.  Turned out the tanks were 
a set of rental ones that had not been returned.  Result a set of tanks that 
the welding supply shops will not refill.
