Subject: Tie rod end Q

Hi list,

I am booking a front beam rebuild next week. I am getting a
fleetline(brazilian mid '70's split) beam rebuilt and I will then transplant
this into the Dacb due to the more readily available spares and anti roll
bar. This due to the more readily available spares and less weekday downtime
with my daily driver.

The mech is not going to do the tie rods for some reason and I will
therefore need to replace these myself. As far as I can determine they are
not available as VW parts(in south africa at least).

Question: If I find a tie rod end that is of a larger overall dimension than
the original but which has the same thread can I take up the extra length by
using an adjustable tie rod on both sides?

TIA 

Michael
