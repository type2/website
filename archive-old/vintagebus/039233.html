Subject: Front beam from 75 to 66
Date: Tue, 22 May 2001 16:04:47 -0400
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

In a greater effort to enhance the braking power of my '66 I have decided to
attempt (notice the word attempt) to put a front beam from a '75 bus into a
'66 bus.  Apparently this is a fairly straight forward process, but want to
run through the steps with you all before I miss something huge.  I like the
idea of ball-joints, disc brakes, and dual chamber master cylinder...  My MC
is shot right now so it is a good excuse also to update instead of just
replace.

There is some disagreement that the '75 front beam will attach into the four
17mm bolt holes on the '66 correctly.  I have seen many people on the list
claim success so I think it can be done.  If it is close the holes can
always be grinded out to fit if necessary, they have got to be somewhat
close to begin with.

In random order here are the disassembly steps:
1.  Take speedo cable off.
2.  Disconnect the E-brake cables.
3.  Disconnect drag link.
4.  Disconnect some other link down there which should be obvious.
5.  Remove hard brake lines from the master cylinder.
6.  Remove the beam by removing the 4 bolts on each side.  Load on jack and
put in supports so I do not crush myself :) 
6.  Remove MC 
7.  Follow steps from Eric and Barb to trim the MC rod for the DC MC in Type
2 Library.
8.  Get brake fluid reservoir from a Rabbit (or a '67 good luck!).

Assembly in semi-order:
1.  Put in new DC MC with adjusted rod.
2.  Connect rear brakes hard line into the MC.
3.  Put on the Rabbit fluid reservoir.
4.  Put beam in place and secure by the 8 bolts.
5.  Connect hard lines for the front brakes.  (Also check rubber lines,
pads, and rotors for condition)
6.  Reattach the drag link and other misc link.
7.  Connect and readjust E-brake cables.
8.  Connect speedo cable.
9.  Bleed the darn brakes again!!!  Arg!  
10.  Go for a spin.
11.  Have a beer, relax, and let the wife complain at you how badly you just
wasted a weekend :)


Also if I have the '75 rear brakes is there any updates I can do to the rear
brakes of my '66 while I am at it?  I hate adjusting those darn drums!

A special thank you goes to John Baker for giving the '75 up for adoption in
the first place!  Thanks, it is being used to help save a '71 and upgrade a
'66!  Hopefully it can help others in the long run by more parts donations
for the needy busses.


TIA!,
