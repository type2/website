&lt;&lt; 2.&gt; Keep in mind that Blue Nelson's Dormobile was
 dumped on it's side while enroute to/from Alaska. It
 came back the next Summer to win first over my freshly
 completed 67 Westy at the June VWClassic meets three
 years in a row. I have three Second Place plaques due
 to his Dormie! You go!, Blue.
 {Point being is that the bus can still become a very
 nice show bus if that is you intention. Otherwise put
 it on four wheels and drive it.} Do it YOUR way! ;-)
 Tell everyone else to buzz off if they dont like it.

I got to look at the extent of the damage today.  I just couldnt bare to the 
last 2 days.  I kept myself locked in my room in bed.

All the pillars on that side all the way to the roof are pushed in about 3 
inches and buckled at the roof.  The beltline was basically pushed in and 
ground down, the rain gutter is gone, the roof in screwed up a bit near the 
drivers door.  The door doesnt open, the rear hatch wont move more than a few 
inches because the rain gutter in the back is pushed down hitting the top of 
the hatch.  The decklid opens but a litte tight.  That whole side is just 
pushed over.  

The pillar behind the drivers door window is pushed way in.  It looks a lot 
better in the pictures than it really is.

The bus had its rear passenger corner taken out at one time and it was fixed. 
 I was just getting ready to replace the dented nose and dogleg on the 
passenger side and a few other pieces.  I just dont think it would really be 
worth it in my mind to spend all the dough.  I love the bus to death, its my 
first bus and first car.  I would love if someone on the list here in town 
could check it out and give me their opinion in person.

Well im off to try and get the 57 running.  God it hurts looking at the 67. 
Maybe I could drive it mangled and all to Prescott, just write &quot;Another 
Product of A Drunk Driver&quot; on the sides.  Maybe not.
