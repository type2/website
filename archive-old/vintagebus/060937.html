Subject: 70 westy stuff into a 61?

Hi all, I found a 70 westy being parted out in the Dallas area today. I
bought the z-bed for $40, now I'm kinda half-way thinking about maybe
getting the tall side closet that goes next to it and the overhead
cabinet that goes over the very back top area. Can someone please tell me
if these would fit into a 61 kombi ? The z-bed looks like it'll go in
with no problems, but do the closet and overhead cabinet fit or would
they need modified? BTW the bus is at Rick's Auto Service on Lucky lane
in Dallas if you need some parts, the 70 still has f/r end, no engine,
good doors,windows, etc. He also had a scary looking split westy
frankenbus w/ bay window dash and running gear, it belonged to a customer
but sounded like it might be for sale for around $500.
Thanks, Chris
