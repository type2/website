Subject: Re: [VB] Hippy Bus Needed


&gt;The icing on the movie experience, though, was going through all that,
&gt;walking for a week, my love of my life left bereft on some downtown city
&gt;street, and only two seconds of it are in the film. And although the two
&gt;stars, Robin Williams and Billy Crystal were, well, Robin Williams and Billy
&gt;Crystal, the film wasn't that good, either (&quot;Father's Day&quot;).



AMEN!  My 70 is in The Big Green, a Disney film. We filmed several DAYS of
our cars... in one scene, the goalie of the soccer team gets outts his old
Suburban, and walks in front of my bus.
That's it.
10 days location work, $1200 to me and all the food we could wheedle from
the food people, for 1.5 secs. They coulda blown up a photo for a backdrop,
for less! Movie stinks, too.
3 points:  stay w/ your vehicle! They then have to pay YOU extra money as a
'driver.'
AS a 'driver,' insist on eating with the tech crew (my buddy w/ the 63 bug
and I kept saying we were Teamsters. Which I was. Once)... the 'extras'
were eating Beanie Weinies, we had shrimp scampi!
DON'T let em paint the car - ask Rex Rogers about my former 59 he now owns;
it used to have a cool hippy flag job, was brush painted puke green for
Travolta film 'Michael.&quot;
