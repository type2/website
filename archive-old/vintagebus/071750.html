Subject: Turn of the tide... It runs!!!

With the bad news of what happened to Richards RHD taco container truck and dawns highroof, I
thought I would hit the list with some good news. At approximately 5:30 am this morning, my 1958
#181 'Bullet Binz' graced the streets of my neighborhood under its own power for the first time
since 1977! The speedo says 8000 miles, whether that is correct or not I dunno, but it sure seems
like it!.... I need to contact the owner I have info on from the 70s to find out the deal, I have
never seen or driven a bus with such a tight front end, i cant detect ANY freeplay in the
steering/front end! It drives like new and i was happy. The tranny purred nicely and didnt even hint
at popping out of gear. I cruised the neighboor hood 3 or 4 times, while the paperboy stared
curiously and the cub scouts who were out hanging up flags didnt seem to know what to think. 3 more
months until its first show (Jerome) and the rock hill of death. I cant wait!
