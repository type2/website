Subject: Plastic shift rod bush?.....WAS One of recently slain in Iraq
  was a bus driver

I'm an Aussie.
I won't pretend that everyone here particularly
approves of the manner things were done but it's our
brothers, sisters, sons, daughters and friends putting
their life on the line for a a reasonable cause,
however you judge the actions of politicians.
A guy I know is in the Royal Australian Navy and has
just left for his second tour.
And I thank God that he's over there allowing us to
continue our comfy little existence.
And buses ARE a very comfy existence.

Now, back to the reason for this list was established.
I believe the shiftrod on my splitty on needs a
plastic shroud or bushing up near the shifter.
Is this true?
I didn't pull the thing to pieces and there are some
glaring gaps in my knowledge.
:o)
Cheers &amp; God Bless
