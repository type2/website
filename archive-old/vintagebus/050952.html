Subject: Balancing Tires-For What It's Worth


Okay... there was a recent thread about the balancing of rims for our 
beloved beasts and how difficult it was to find a shop.  Interestingly, I 
was replacing tires on my H**da last night and mentioned this to one of the 
guys in the shop to see if he might, on the off chance, have any thoughts.  
He looked at me funny for a moment and asked &quot;you mean those older rims with 
the big opening?&quot; to which I responded yep... he gazed up at the roof a 
moment, walked across the shop and reach down behind on of the spin 
balancers and held up what I would swear was an adaptor.  Said they got them 
in from time to time.  We are talking the spin balancers now and not the old 
school bubble balancers.

Now, you may ask, is where was I?  COSTCO of all places.  So, if you are 
near one of these outfits you might want to wander into the tire shop and 
see if they have an adaptor.  The fellow in the Vallejo, CA store said he 
thought all the COSTCO tire shops had them but he wasn't certain.
