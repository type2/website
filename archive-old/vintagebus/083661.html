&gt; because the 8mm studs
&gt; are put in with the steel case saver inserts and they
&gt; won't pull out, with that said the engine must have
&gt; the 10mm studs. This is where I put my foot in my
&gt; mouth, I have never seen a 8mm stud pull out of a
&gt; case. 

Hello Phil  I have seen these case savers pull out  usually on older cases 
that had them install not the late cases   When this happens you probably are 
better off throwing that case away.  Also as I told john what I do is take an 
old head nut and weld the opening shut to use as a driver to install these super 
studs ,  This allows you to get them in further and is easier than double 
nutting them . Later  Mark Dearing
