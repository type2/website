&lt;&lt;  One head is the original '71  113 101375A (35.5mm X 32mm) and the other 
is from a '74  043 101 375A (35.5mm X 32mm).   Will there be any great 
difference between the two? &gt;&gt;
Hi Steve,
Just being differant castings could make thier chamber differant.  Plus who 
knows if one or the other was flycut at one time making it even more 
differant!   Eric&amp;Barb
