With reference to those popouts, my '61 Doublecab has that style, but I was 
only able to find NOS barndoor latches.  There must be something different 
about the frames, because the barndoor latches won't hold the window shut 
quite right.  I've got the correct latch for one side, so I'll try that soon 
and see if there's an improvement in latching.
