Subject: $199 Tents &amp; $69 Awnings ARE IN!

&gt; The tents have actually been Stateside since the beginning of the month,
&gt; but Customs has been very slow to process the release. We had hoped
&gt; for a release today but now it's looking like sometime next week


Well, I spoke too soon.  We got our customs release today after all, and the
tents and two hours later we were unloading the container at our shop! So
we'll be shipping all existing orders on Monday (spilling over into Tuesday
depending on how long it takes; there are a lot of orders to fill!).  Any
new orders taken at this point should ship mid-week or so (sooner if ordered
via Expedited shipping).

Again, for details on these, see http://busdepot_dot_com/tent.jpg and
http://busdepot_dot_com/awning.jpg .
