hey chip and volks,

my daily driver is a '60 westy. my round trip commute to work is about 30-35
miles, and then you can add about 10-20 miles on that daily after running errands
etc. i've been driving the '60 as my daily for a little over a year now. prior to
that it was a '71 westy. until 4 months ago, i had the original tranny with one
original redux box and one later redux box. after discovering this, i switched to
a '67 tranny complete with redux boxes. with a tired 1500sp and the '67 tranny, i
can cruise comfortably at 60mph here in somewhat hilly southwest ohio. the '60 has
been a very dependable driver, once i had everything roadworthy. so in a nutshell,
i don't think it's excessive as long as the bus is up to it. my bus takes a lot
more care, maintenance, and $$ as a daily driver than my old '78 toyota station
wagon did, but it's a bus!

just my 0.02, good luck!

tony
