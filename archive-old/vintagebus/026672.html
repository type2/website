Subject: Re: Mounting safaris...

Here's a helpful trick...

How NOT to install the seals:

After a few beers, it had already gotten dark outside, and all we had
was a mechanic's trouble light. James and I each took a window... It
became something of a competition... Mine turned out better, but that's
not saying much...

Needless to say, I'll be doing my seals over again. In my defense,
though, the seals that came with my Wolfgang safaris were too small and
didn't fit very well... I'll be getting those seals from someone else.
Anyone know who makes the best safari seals?

ps. Michael McGinn and I met this evening at Denny's to try to figure
out how many bussers will show up tomorrow (Greenville, SC, Denny's on
Wade Hampton Blvd., 1pm!) in case we needed to reserve tables... Denny's
doesn't make reservations on weekends unless they're made well in
advance, with a known number of guests, so we will just hafta see what
happens. I hope we swamp them!
