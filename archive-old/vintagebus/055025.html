Subject: clutch/shift problem

hey list, i sold one of my buses to my buddy a while ago and he's having =
a clutch and shifting problem.  when the bus is running you can push the =
clutch pedal and put it in gear, sit at a stop light, run thru the =
gears, whatever with no problems.  while you try going up thru the gears =
with the bus moving tho, it seems that the clutch wont disengage when =
you push the pedal.  has a new cable and the pedal is adjusted =
correctly.  i have had clutches go on me before and this seems like =
almost the opposite.  usually you cant put it in gear at a stop, but you =
can shift easily at the right rpms while driving.  any suggestions would =
be greatly appreciated.  thanks!
josh
