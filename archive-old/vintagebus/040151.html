Subject: Bus Died any Central Vally folks going to Sac?

Well she didn't hold up to as well as I thought I think I overheated and 
fried a ring or something on the way in to work this morning. Was going 
about 60 heard a ka-chunk started losing power, looked back no smoke, and 
finally died. Won't fire on any cylinders there is a spray of oil in the 
engine compartment, which is normally very clean.  Adjusted my valves about 
3 weeks ago, I was due for an oil change and I got cheap and started using 
87 octane fuel.  I am going to pull off the valve covers when I tow it home 
tonight go through everything.  Wish me luck.  I was hoping to go to Sac 
this weekend, but looks like I will be here in Lemoore.  Anyone need a 
navigator or company on the ride up from the Central Valley here in Lemoore?
