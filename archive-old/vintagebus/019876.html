Subject: more new engine questions/carb questions/6 volter?
Mime-Version: 1.0

My bus is currently 6 volt, i plan on keeping it that way for the forseeable
future...if i get the new dual port from ronnie, i need to get a new carb, the
only ones available have a 12volt electric choke...anyone have any experience
with running these on a 6volt bus?

would i need a voltage changer(term escapes me)just for the choke? will it
work ok without it?

as for single vs dual port....what exactly are the differences in the
longblock...is it just in the heads? in other words what if i switched my
single port heads for the dual port heads? would i need to make any other
changes? I ask because I think I would rather run single port, and I have
already had my single port heads in the process of being rebuilt, and the
pistons reground(correct term? sorry) plus then I could reuse my intake
manifold, and carb...
