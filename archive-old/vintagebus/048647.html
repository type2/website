I'm gonna end up tinting my windows here pretty soon. I'll be doing it
myself. My questions have to do with the laws, specifically here in Texas.

The current law is applicable for cars '87 and newer, or any tinting done
to a vehicle after that time. It only allows for 35% on the
driver/passenger front windows.

I'm wondering about a vehicle that was tinted before that. It would have to
be &quot;Grandfathered&quot; I assume and wouldn't be subject to the current
restrictions. The problem is I can't seem to remember what the law was
before that. I don't think there was any restrictions on those front windows.

Any Texas listees that might know, pass me the info.

I also wondering if the car theoretically was tinted back in the 70's with
dark windows on the driver &amp; passenger front windows,  would it be legal to
drive it like that now. I'm gonna call Department of Public Safety to find
out, but I have a feeling they'll just tell me it'd be better to re-tint
them instead of what the law actually is. I'm having a hard time finding
anything about the &quot;sunscreening devices&quot; laws in Texas on the net.

I don't plan on tinting any of my other buses dark, but I'd like to do this
one I'm working on now. Any info would be great.
