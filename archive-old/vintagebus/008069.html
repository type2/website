&gt; 1. I'm clueless as to what to bring, camping/eatingwise.

Water is a good idea. Most folks that have been before bring extra food. You
may run out of free beer pretty quick, so plan accordingly. The Havasu boys
throw on the taco feed, and the Chili cookoff can cover another meal. No
food vendors, though.

&gt; 2. Do people bring toys to share?  Stuff to swap?

Sure, pretty near everyone swaps to some degree. Don't figure on selling
much in the way of big ticket items, lot's of people blow the wad just
getting there, but there is a lot of stuff for sale.


&gt; 4. I *think* my Taxi mentioned something about a caravan on Friday?  If
&gt; anyone needs a spare bus driver, please keep me in mind for that, too.
&gt; (If I drive someone else's bus to jerome do I still get a raffle ticket?
&gt; :-)
&gt;
The caravan is Saturday and leaves from the Home Depot parking lot at I-17
and Thunderbird at 7AM. If you register, you'll get a free raffle ticket.
There will be two stops with free raffles on the caravan route. See you up
there!
