When doing Stephen's (your vw_dot_com's) Berg linkage, it took me at least 2-3
hours to get it set right to where the carbs opened evenly and stopped
evenly. Berg's linkage was not designed for the Kadrons and just modified
Weber linkage, after many frustrating hours I thought I finally got it
right. You need to use BOTH of the return springs furnished on the linkage
and make sure that the cable moves freely. On the guide tube through the
shroud I use a small piece of fuel hose clamped on the tube against the
shroud to keep it from sliding about. This is very difficult linkage to set
up and requires bending of the passenger side linkage arm to get the proper
stroke out of the carbs.


ronnie, prefers stock Kadron linkage    old volks of az.

Subject: [VB] Accelerator Cable ?


I just got my engine back together about a week ago and in the process of
partially rebuilding it I changed the linkage on the carbs (Kadrons) to the
Berg setup.  The Berg setup  does not use as strong a return spring as what
the Kadrons came with so I started having problems with the carbs returning
to idle.  First off, the linkage on the left is at a pretty radical angle
for the ball joint to operate correctly but Clyde assured me it was ok.
Second, when I crawled under the truck to see if the cable was getting
snagged on something I discovered that the tube which runs through the fan
housing keeps wanting to follow the cable, leaving the cable to ride/rub
against the fan housing.  All this rubbing has actually caused the cable to
start cutting through the fan housing.  Now that I &quot;think&quot; that I have found
the problem I start to crawl out from under the truck.  Out of the corner of
my eye, I notice the cable is also cutting into one of the tranny bolts.
The PO told me the tranny was out of a 67.  Could this be the problem?  Are
pre67 trannys different in design?  So now my problems are as followed:

1.  Carb linkage not returning to idle (could be because of the other
problems).
2.  Tube through fan housing not staying put.
3.  Cable rubbing against tranny.
4.  Linkage at radical angle.  Me thinks it's still not right.

TIA for any help.  Me and spitting and sputtering truck need you help.
