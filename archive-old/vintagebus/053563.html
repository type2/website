Subject: Headlight Bucket Rebuilding

I finally got around to doing something about the headlight buckets on my
'67 last weekend.    I took it apart and realized why one keeps looking for
worms and the other just wanders off to one side; most of the &quot;doo-dads&quot;
that are used to adjust the lamp are shot or in pretty bad shape.

One of the adjusting screw head is striped, the spacers that fit on either
side of the adjusting screws fell apart when I touched them, and there
appears to be be some additional hard plastic/rubber pieces that the lamp
assembly pivots upon that are either missing or are in various stages of
falling apart.

I have gone out looking for these parts (I would think that I am not the
only one to have this need after about 35 years of wear and tear) and have
had very little luck finding anything in parts catalogs I have around the
house or online.

I am beginning to think that I may need to Mc Guiver a solution.

First of all, has anybody had any luck in finding these parts in either a
'misc doo-dad rebuild kit for headlight buckets' or as individual
components??

If you cant point me to a parts source, I would be interested in your Mc
Guiver approach.  I know I can always go to a hardware store and find the
screws, but I am interested in what you used to might have used for that
plastic pivot piece and possibly the retaining clips (mine are in pretty bad
shape but I can probably get away with what I have).

Thanks a million times in advance!!
