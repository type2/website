Thanks to all the folks who are sending in their insight the 
problem I have, with my '66 bus not starting. I'll have to 
digest them and will send more comments back later.

For now, I'll mention that I did replace the bushing with the 
one that came with the rebuilt starter unit. Seemed nice and 
round inside. Is this supposed to fit very snugly around the 
starter shaft? (like the vertical bushings in the steering thingy
(name escapes me now) that's attached to the front torsion bar 
tube?) Or is it just supposed to be round? ... the new one seemed
about the same as the old one ... you could just drop it onto the
shaft; gravity would move it; was not snug. Nor did it wiggle. 
Both old and &quot;new&quot; seemed evenly round inside.

Also, the voltage test I did on the battery was *after* the 
rebuilt starter had completely stopped (when first installed, 
it turned the engine very, very slowly -- as slow as I could 
turn by hand.  After numerous tests and jumps, etc., and trying 
to turn it again and again, it stopped working completely, like 
the whole thing had just burned out. It may have shown some 
positive voltage ... like 1 volt.  This is just a cheapy little 
multitester.

thanks again,
	Mark
