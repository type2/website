&gt; Came back from a road trip and cleaned my 67 Bus. Like always, I covered the
&gt; distributor and coil with a trash bag before rinsing out the motor 
&gt; compartment and undercarriage.

Hi Hart,
When we do this we do not covewr anything, just take off the distributor cap 
afterward and wipe out any condensation in the cap before starting.

&gt; Went to start her and nothing. All lights work, just no cranking. Checked 
&gt; the connections from/ to the Battery and starter, all looks right and 
&gt; tight.
&gt; Anyone ever have this happen after a good wash?

Take the clamps off the battery to clean and retighten them.  Looking at them 
does nothing.  While the battery is unconnected it is a good time to check 
for battery water levels and use ONLY distilled water for refilling.  If that 
does not work you need to remove/clean the connections at the starter, and if 
still no luck see if you are getting any voltage from the ignition switch to 
the soliniod.  Nope, never had that happen that way!
