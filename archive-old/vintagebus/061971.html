Subject: 200,000 miles and Great Deals

I had a couple neat adventures last week that I want to share with the 
crowds.  First, my 1963 Riviera Camper rolled over 200,000 miles.  It may 
not be a big deal to some, but this is the highest mileage vehicle I've 
ever owned!  I took probably more pictures of it happening than I needed 
to, but I've put them up at my website 
(http://www.redshift_dot_com/~taylorvw/volks).  This is about as much 
excitement as I've been having in a year where I haven't been able to make 
to as many shows as I've wanted or do as much work to the bus as I've 
wanted (see, a wedding does take up a lot of attention! ;)

However, last Saturday Amber (she's my fiancee) and I were driving over 
Highway 9 to Santa Cruz (9 is a really cool route if you want an easy, lazy 
drive thru the mountains) when we passed upon an impromptu garage sale on 
the side of the highway.  I first noticed the guy had a bay window 
Westy...cool, I thought!  Then he gave me the high sign (tho, in hindsight 
I think he was high) and I looked over to see a big spread of bus 
parts!!  Well, even though we had to be in Santa Cruz at 10am (it was about 
9.30), we swung around as soon as we could and pulled in to check things 
out.  It was pretty much all bay window stuff, but he had easily two Westy 
interiors that he was parting out.  After some chatting and shooting the 
breeze, Amber and I left with a Westy fridge/sink set up for only 
$40!!  The water jug needs a cleaning, maybe the hoses replaced, but all 
the parts are there and it's not beat up!  So sometime after the wedding, 
I'll wander out and replace my Riviera icebox/water pump (that's not hooked 
up) setup with the Westy one.  We were late getting into Santa Cruz, but we 
at least had a good reason.
