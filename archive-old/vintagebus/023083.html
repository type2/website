Subject: bus work
Mime-Version: 1.0


Well, while everyone else was drinking themselves silly and blowing things
up, I got a bunch of little stuff on the bus done.  

I finally have a horn, albeit a 6v on a 12v system - man that's loud!

Installed 2 additional dome lights in the cargo area (need one more!) - now
I have a well-lit cargo area.   I added one over each cargo door - they
should have done that from the factory!
 
Re-wired the siren (melted the previous switch!), 

Installed a speedo cable-operated backup light!  I'm thinking of topping it
off with one of those beepy things.  

Anyone have a spare type3/'67 bug reverse light assembly?
