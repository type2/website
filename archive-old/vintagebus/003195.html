I decided to go on a little weekend excursion.  I ended up putting on 252
miles.

I left Saturday morning for the little town of Brownville, NE located along
the Missouri river about 70 miles East of me.  Every year this time they
have a big flea market and the historicity and beautiful scenery of the
small town makes it a natural location for such an event.  Brownville is the
first town to have been settled in Nebraska back in the 1850's but it's
history goes back a few years prior to that.  Not until 1970 was the whole
town put on the historical register and surprisingly despite a hundred or so
years passing between it's founding and it's inductance into the register,
many of the original buildings still stood including the jail which is
nothing more than a metal cage outside where you sit and get humiliated by
your being exposed to the public. :-)

I didn't find a heck of a lot of stuff.  I did end up buying a box of
assorted 1950's thru 1960's Popular Mechanix and Popular Science mags for
$25 (more on this later) and an original VW postcard with a nice photo of a
family in a ragtop bug.  The card was mint until I somehow mulched the
corner of it (DAMN!)  I met up with Judith Noah, the previous owner of my
bus and was able to give her her first ride in her old bus in over 4 years.
I let her drive it and although she had a little trouble with the manual
trans after being away from it so long, she thoroughly enjoyed putting
around for a couple of blocks on the backroads of Brownville.  Not many
people get the priviledge to drive their old rides after they've been sold.

Not long after I had arrived at Brownville, I bumped into listee Glen Hadley
in his 79 Westy  just as he and his family were departing.  We had intended
to meet  there in the morning sometime and with my later arrival and his
obligations, we spoke for a few minutes - just long enough to make
arrangments for supper and for Glen to show me his $75 table top bushing
lathe he bought.  By the time I stumbled across the guy who had the lathes,
he was all out!  DOH!

After filling myslef on funnel cakes, lemonade, BBQ Pork, and kettle corn
(made the old way with oil and suger (YUM!)), I decided to head out to
Hamburg, IA about 20 miles up I-29 to Glen's house.  Glen had attended a
company picnic in Nebraska City in the afternoon and had said that around
5:00 he would be home.  I had called his cell and there was no answer so I
assumed he'd still be at the picnic.  Much to my surprise, the family was
already at home when I showed up (should of called the home number!).  I got
to meet Ben, Ephram, (Glen's sons) and his wife Arian.  As is the case with
the listees I've met, they're all good folks and I enjoyed my little 3 hour
visit with them.  Glen provided a snack supper consisting of whatever he had
available in the fridge 'n' freezer so we all got a little of this and
little of that.  I found it a very nice break from what I normally end up
doing while on the road so many thanks to Glen and family for the eats and
association.  I was also pleased to meet Glen's workmate (forgot his name),
his wife and daughters.  Both Glen and his buddy work at the Cooper Nuclear
Power Plant just outside of Brownville along the Missouri River.  Glen can
talk all this lingo involved with nuclear reactors like I talk about VWs.
I'm glad our reactors are in the hands of guys such as Glen.  :-)

After a nice chat with Ephram about lego engines and VWs, I decided it was
time to head up to Rob Laffoon's in Omaha about 65 miles away.  Glen and
Ephram had helped me Rain-X my windshields so I could see through the
sprinkles that permeated the weekend here and there so I was set.  I bid my
company farewell, fueled up at the first gas station and headed up I-29 to
Omaha.  I followed a train along the road for a while, saw a few cars here
and there.  Got passed by a few semi's and drove through rain and dry spots.
It was really dark out there along I-29 - no small towns along the road like
I'm used to in Nebraska - it was kind of  a scary and forlorn sort of ride
when I was by myself (I need a cruising companion!) putting along.  I drove
my fears away by listening to the 6v AM radio to KWBE 1110.  The Michael
Medved show was on and he just talks about everything under the sun.  He was
criticizing some new movie about homeless people where a guy from London
lives with the homesless in the Subway tunnels for 2 years.  Of course the
phone lines were jammed in response to his public critique but by the time
they took calls, I round Rob's house.  Justin was outside riding his little
aluminum Razor scooter and as usual, I was welcomed like a minor hero, had
my stuff carried in for me, and was made to feel right at home.

We surfed the net, pawed through my old PM and PS mags which we found are
loaded with old VW reviews - one details the switchover from oval window to
rectangular window, a review of the Notchback, a full page add for the 1966
21 Window Bus, and other little reviews throughout the 50's and 60's.  I
want to make these available over the web but my scanner just doesn't do the
magazines justice.  Would someone be willing to let me send them the
magazines with all appropriate articles marked and scan them in for me?  I
know Terry Wolfe in Omaha would provide server space.  These are good
articles which are often overlooked and deserve a reading eye - they were
written at the period in time when VW's dominated the US foreign car market.

I got to meet one of the guys that I met at the Omaha VW Show this year.  I
didn't get his last name but his name was Kevin - a 30'ish looking VW Nut
from Ioway and between the 3 of us bachelor's and Justin, the weekend was
full of good farts, belches, snooring, scratching, and all kinds of guy
things. :-)

Saturday night about 11:00 I just got flat out tired and crashed in my
overalls.  Rob and Justin donated a sleeping bag and pillow to the cause as
I had forgotten my bedding and I slept so-so.  Sunday we got up and just
lollygagged around the place. We decided to have Breakfast around 10:45 or
so.  Later in the afternoon we decided to go to Omaha's new Harbor Freight
store and that's when all hell broke loose.  Rob, Kevin, and I blew a
combined total of about $300 on all kinds of tools.  I got a drill bit
sharpener and a winter time's supply of gloves.  I got to see lathes,
milling machines, and all kinds of neat stuff.  Now that is my kind of
store! :-)

I forgot to mention that we ran down to a new friend of Rob's shop (Doug)
and I saw the most impressive array of metal shop tools I've ever seen -
machines from the 1800's until present that have been bought for next to
nothing (free in some cases) that Doug has restored and has now been put to
use in his shop.  Everything from the HUGE 1890 Lathe to the more modern
bandsaw was there, I counted 5 milling machines, several lathes, drill
presses - the list goes on and on.  Next door was an SCCA MOD? car that
looked like a miniature Formula One car.  It had a 4 cylinder Ford engine in
it coupled to a customized bay window bus trans which sat upside down in the
car.  The guts are totally the creation of the owners.  This thing was all
customed from the disk brake rotors next to the trans to the full flow
oiling setup, custom suspension, electronic shifting, computer diagnostics,
etc.  This was one impressive/expensive racer!

After our little shopping spree, I decided it was time to head home.  We
went back to Rob's house, I loaded up my bus with everything, and headed for
home on I-80.  It took me almost an hour to get from Rob's house to Lincoln
which was doing really good.  I took some pictures of an accident and
traffic jam on the interstate on my way back but haven't looked at them yet
since I got home.  I got excellent mileage with a 20+ mph tailwind all the
way home and was blowing people away right and left.  I'm sure I surprised a
few people with my rocket sled bud! :-)  I rolled into Beatrice around 6:30,
ate some homemade pizza, tried to get caught up on my weekend of emails, and
wrote this post.

And that was my weekend.  Thanks to everyone involved for making it great
kicked back weekend!
