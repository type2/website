&lt;&lt; Will the H4 kits fit in these buckets? &gt;&gt;
Hi Jeremiah,
Best to go down to your FLAPS, and check out the bulbs to the reflectors you 
have.  There are over ten differant models of halogens out there being sold 
now so without a picture it really is hard to say exactly what you need to 
fit in them.  Eric&amp;Barb
