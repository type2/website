Subject: Reduction box area noise

It sounds sort of like a bad bearing or a dull thumping/whirring and seems to
make the noise every wheel revoloution or every other wheel revolution.

Make sure your axle nut is seated on the drum and tight. You may have to get a
nut with a collar to seat properly on the drum.
