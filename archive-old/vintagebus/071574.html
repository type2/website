Subject: Re: [VB] rubber undercoat in doors?

----- Original Message -----

&gt; that sounds like a great idea. does the vapor barrier go between the body
&gt; panel and the insulation? would por-15 eliminate the need for a vapor
&gt; barrier?


Vapor barrier goes between the door panel and the door.

If you got the POR-15 to cover everywhere, then you would not need the vapor
barrier. It's interesting stuff. Paint dries faster with less humidity.
POR-15 dries faster the more humid it is. The more humid it is, the better
it works, quite the opposite of paint.  Whenever I get the time, I plan on
undercoating my bus with the stuff.
