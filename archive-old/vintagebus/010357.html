Greetings all,

I don't know where it comes from, I'm sure it's a mystery to many of you
too,
I was sitting around just minding my own business when all of a sudden I
start
developing this strange hankering for a split window bus...

I have owned seven or eight type1s during high school  and college ( more
years
 ago than I care to add up at this point) good inexpensive transpo. that
could be
wrenched on with a fair amount of success by following the detailed
instructions
of a guy named Muir. I've spent many hours with a brother, a beer, and a
baseball
game on the radio, fussing over the innards of various air-cooled engines
just trying
to keep them going on a shoe-string budget, using funky mis-matched tools,
and
generous amounts of duct tape, tin cans and wire hangers.

Times change, financial situations brighten up a bit, and I started thinking
I wanted
more from my transportation-- heat, defroster, windshield wipers that
actually improve
visibility, etc.. this goes on for a while and next thing you know your
borrowing tens
of thousands of dollars so you can drive around in the latest and greatest
automotive
technology that humankind has to offer.

A few months ago, for some reason, I actually looked at the monthly owing
statement
from my yupified &quot;SUV&quot; and realized that after paying for this thing for two
years I still
owed over 10 grand plus interest and it was going to be another two years
before I was free
from &quot;The Man&quot;. Something snapped and I said scr*w it! I gotta get back to
my roots,
back to the days when the first thing you did when you got in your ride was
quietly (and
sometimes intently) listen to the tikkity-tikkity-tik of your valves and
think &quot;what's going on
with my little buddy today?&quot; valves tight? timing off? has it really been
3000 miles already?

The 4r*nner was gone the next week. Replacing it with a type1 was out, I'm a
family guy
now- two kids, a dog, a wife-- we gotta move a lot of stuff around.
