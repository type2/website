&gt; back.  Has anyone ever made a cab divider? How would one do it? is
&gt; cardboard good? or should i use some thinner wood?  Its a walk through,

I have done it twice,  once I used Luan, a thin plywood and cut a hole in
the middle and put plexiglas in so I could see through.  the next time I
just used a heavy curtain.

both made a very noticable difference
the plywood worked much better.

now I just have a gas heater.
