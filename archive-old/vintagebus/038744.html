Hello list.  I recently bought a set of DCNF's with manifolds and linkage
for a good price. I'm having my mechanic tear them down and install them for
me.  He noticed some sort of homebrew throttle arm on one carb though. It is
also missing the return spring. Can you carb guru's look through your stash
to see if you have an extra throttle arm and spring?  I can't get back on
the road with out them... Also looking for DCNF air cleaners, but not that
important right now. Thanks in advance!
