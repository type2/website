(Sorry, I couldn't resist)

The Y2K Theme Song
  [another last-minute Y-to-K conversion, 
set to the tune of &quot;The Mickey Mouse Club Theme Song&quot;]

What's the buzzword for the bug
That ends the century?
  Y-2-K !  Y-2-K !  P-A-N-I-C!

Come along, and join the throng
and raid the grocery
  D-I-S  T-U-R  B-A-N-C-E

Beans and rice and spam (and guns!)
Are all we need to be
  S-U-R  V-I-V  A-L-I-S-T

Your box won't boot, so join the suit
against the industry:
  M-A-L  P-R-A  C-T-I-C-E

What will work and what will crash?
It's all a mystery!
  P-R-E  D-I-C  A-M-E-N-T

No more water, gas, or cash
or electricity
  C-A-T  A-S-T  R-O-P-H-E

Life gets nasty, brutish, short
and poor as it can be
  A-P-O  C-A-L  Y-P-T-I-C

Y2K (make a buck!), Y2K (make a buck!),
Watch how consulting fees are raised up high!
  High! High! High!

How did this whole mess occur
and bring such misery?
  P-R-O (oh, sure, two digits is enough)
  G-R-A (airborne at midnight? good luck!)
  M-M-I-N-G !
