I recently aquired a set of original safari windows, but
they are missing the dash tabs and wing nuts.  Does anyone
out there have any NOS tabs.  I was told the wing nuts are
no big deal.  Thanks for any leads.

Matthew H., I don't need the bases they were attached to the
latches and I did'nt notice them.  They are in good
condition.
