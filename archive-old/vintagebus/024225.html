&gt; All panel vans did not have upper cargo vents.  Bench seat models came 
&gt; stock with upper cargo vents.  Walk-through models came without upper 
&gt; cargo vents.  Bench seat models could be ordered without upper cargo 
&gt; vents and there is an m-code for this option.

Well, I stand corrected...as long as the bus that was pictured &quot;was&quot; a
panel van.   Still looked like a Kombi to me though.  The one opened
camper window seemed to show a radius on the edge of the window opening
in the body.
