&gt; First piece of advice is even though it might be new in the VW box, take
&gt; the time to check everything you can.  I found 6 small and 2 large case
&gt; studs looser than spec on each engine, not the same on both.  6 of 16 head
&gt; nuts were loose on the 1st engine.

Loose as in finger tight or loose as in not quite up to the book spec?  It
has been noted that VW de Mexico uses a lower torque on their engines,
probably because of questionable stud metallurgy.  I recommend swapping
for used Germans studs before installing the engine.

&gt; Cylinder studs:
&gt; Dp studs are 8mm, SP studs are 10mm.  To change a DP longblock to be ready
&gt; for SP heads, you need 4 more longer upper studs...
&gt; ...I bought 4 new lower 8mm studs from my local aircooled guy and
&gt; applied an 8x1.25mm die, cutting about 1 3/4&quot; more thread to one end and
&gt; cutting off the excess.

Knowing how close the studs are to the limit in stock configuration, I
wonder if cutting threads is such a good idea.  I'll bet that the threads
on the stock studs are rolled, not cut.
