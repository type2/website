Message-ID: &lt;5141e059.243e6456_at_aol_dot_com&gt;

 I've been at a horse show and the night before last I had to pull the knob
in and out a couple of time before the headlights would come on. Last night
going to the show I had a little trouble again, but at the horse show, NO
LIGHTS. I finished my work and called AAA. By the time AAA came out the Bus
no longer started. Could the light have drained the battery? I did try to
put them on several time while I tested any loose wired underneath the
dash. The lights inside the Camper work.
 I have 9 hours to get back out to the show. Since I bought the Camper I
have put $1500 worth of repairs in, so it's not like it hasn't been to the
mechanic and checked over. I was told the electrical was a mess by that
shop in Indio.  Of course now I can't use AAA to tow it anywhere and the
closes garage, for those of you who know my story is Cheat I mean Chet and
Cliff's so you know I can't go there. Woey woey woe. Did I mention it's
pouring rain here?
 Anyway how I can check out the problem? Any quick fixes that I can do so I
can get it to a garage? Anyone in Sacramento can refer me to a closer

Does your bus start up?  You don't have a low battery, right?  This is both
the lights at once right, not just one?   Do your taillights work?   Dash
lights?    it may be your headlight switch.     Do you have a test light?
  Un srew the screw holding   aa headlight in, turn the lights on and check
the wires to see if they are hot?  Nope?  Okay.   put the headlight back
inplace.   the left two fuses work the low beams, the next two to the right
your high beams.    with the headlights on.. power at either side of any of
those fuses?  no?   Okay, from the fuses block a think yellow and thick white
wire leads to a relay.    The white/black wire brings the power to the relay,
and the brown wire tells it to go high beam or low beam.  Everything
connected?   With the light switch on it there power going to that headlight
relay?  coming out?     Double check there is power at the right hand fuse.
 f there is no power going to the relay check the headlight switch.

 turn the headlight switch off.  Undo the screw holding the switch into the
dash.  This can be hard to undo, often I start it with vise grips (and grease
the screw for installation).   Wiggle the switch out from under the dash.  Be
careful- the big red wires are always hot so don't ground them out.    Two
big red wires are attached to terminal 30.    they are hot right (check with
test light)   pull the switch out halfway.  terminals  57 (two grey wires-
front running lights) 58b (white red striped wires-dash night lights)  and 58
(grey wire-taillights) should be hot.  58b has a reostat- the dash lights, so
turning the stalk of the switch turns the light up or down.     Now the real
test.   Pull the switch out all the way and is there power at terminal 56-
the thick white/black striped wire? (the other end is at the headlight relay)
  There should be?    If wiggling the connections doesn't help, and there is
power into but not out of the switch then the switch is bad.

anyway, that sums up the headlight circuit pretty much (also same in 66)   If
you down load a wiring diagram from Thom's webpage it is all there in colour.
 Hope you buses wires are the original colours.

this is pretty easy and inexpensive and you don't need to even get filthy
