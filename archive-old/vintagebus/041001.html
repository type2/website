Are you saying that there are 2 fuses on this circuit or that the feed from
the fuse block is on the non fused side?

Note from Thom's scans that there is a wire from the switch to the
mounting bracket; this is a ground wire.  The screws that hold the
plate to the air duct complete the ground circuit.  You will have one
more wire from the switch to the far right fuse in the fuse box - it
should also have an inline fuse holder with an 8 amp fuse.
