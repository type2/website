I was making a list of stuff to do to the front end and it seemed reasonable
to make sure the steering box had enough gear oil in it. I checked the
Bentley to bone up on the subject and it says that after Aug '66
transmission grease should be used instead of 90w gear oil.

WTF is transmission grease?
