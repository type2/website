Subject: early 59 walk through standard for sale. Eugene OR.
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

A friend of mine NEEDS to sell his bus asap, no motor, bus boys rear lowering 
kit, front is lowered, either cut and turned or adjustable, I' not sure 
which. not super low, PO just wanted to make it handle more like a car. has a 
bay window camper bed and closet. original door panels all around. It was 
originaly a mango green bus, it's currently in two tone primer. some rust, 
some dents but over all a solid bus. I think hes asking in the area of $800. 
p-mail if interested. or if anyone wants my 63 standard for $750, I'll go get 
it.
