Subject: Re: [VB] nosecone bushings

was written:
&gt; Get access to a lathe and make a drift to press it
&gt; out with or find the 
&gt; original VW410 tool.  


this won't work since the bushings stop on &quot;seats&quot;
inside the nosecone, and they each go in (and get
removed) from different ends. the VW service manual
has a cross section view of this, and you can see the
&quot;seats&quot; in the picture.
the inner bushing presses in and gets removed from the
inside (where the shift forks are). 
the outer gets pressed in and removed from the
outside. i hope that made sense.
if you try to press them all the way through, you'll
ruin the nosecone. 
however making a drift to press them IN works great (i
had one made).
i have had great luck with a round drift/punch that i
have made sure the side and tip are square to
eachother (as in not all chewed up at the end) to get
a good &quot;grip&quot; on the edge of the bushing when tapping
it with a hammer. be patient, they will come out.
VW specifies the following tools for the job: VW401
(press plate), VW412 punch, VW439 guide pin
(shouldered). VW410 is a punch.
