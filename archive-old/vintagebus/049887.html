Subject: Re: [VB] tool source - Jack scouting report

&gt;I don't know if Wal-Mart still has the deal going on... but I know some
&gt;people on the list got in on it a while back too.
&gt;I picked up a 2.5 ton high lift floor jack, and 2 2 ton jack stands that
&gt;go the same height...for a measly $30.  It is some of the same products
&gt;they sell separetly...but it was all in one big box as
&gt;the &quot;SUV package&quot;.  Cheap...very sturdy and well built though.  I haven't
&gt;had any problems with them...and I've used that jack and the stands quite
&gt;a bit.
&gt;The Wal-Mart in town didn't have it...but I was way up in northern WI and
&gt;the wal-mart up there had it...
&gt;shop around...


OK, I went out to Wal Mart and they do stil carry the Jack, stands, and
wheel chocks in one box.  $29.99 is the regular price.

My comments on this stuff:  The jack is the type which I often see on sale
for $17.99.  It has a very small 'saddle', and the wheels are rather close
together.  The jack stands are just like the ones on sale at Checker for
$7.99.

The ideal jack for my purposes is the real big kind of floor jack, with a
saddle a bit larger than the oil strainer plate on the bottom of the Type
1/2 engine.  This is the ideal jack for pulling engines, and the wide
stance gives it extra stability for other lifting jobs.  I once bought one
at Sears, but it was stolen.  I bought one in the Philippines last fall.
The downside is the weighjt of the thing.  It's a bear to lift into the
back of a truck.

After Wal Mart, I tried a couple of other places.  First, Sam's Club.
Their jack was about the right size, but I didn't like the shape of the
saddle, and the 'quick lift' pedal on the side was just a bit gimmicky for
my tastes.

Checker had the sale jack stands in stock, and I bought a pair.  Now I have
two pair, so I can really go crazy and fix all by brakes at the same time
if need be.  Checker had three different jacks.  The smallest was
comperable to the Wal Mart jack, but cost $39.99.  The next two were about
the same (large) size, but cost $99.99 and $109.99.  Forget it.

Next I went to a place which sells a million and one defferent Chinese
tools.  I found just the jack I was looking for.  Big, simple, red, and
$60.  I'll go back and get it as soon as I start on my Bus, unless I see a
similar one on sale somewhere in the meantime.
