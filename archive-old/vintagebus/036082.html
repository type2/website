To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

there were a pile of real early headlights in boxes with Mercedes stickers, I 
think they were found in South America but were German made, and sold by 
Vintage

In the late 80s Mercedes was still making the early trucks that used these 
headlights in Brazil , I assume the later production used Brazilian 
headlights but never looked that close.......
