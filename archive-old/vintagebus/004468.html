Subject: Re: [VB] Shifter Plates
Date: Wed, 12 Apr 2000 15:33:38 -0700

Well I checked my shifter plate because my shifting has been rough. Turns
out, it's upside down. After flipping it right side up, I couldn't get into
1st or 2nd at all (reason I had originally put it in upside down). I crawled
under and checked the shift coupling and found that one of the screws was a
home-made job that I had ground a pointy tip on years ago (for lack of a
real one). The point wasn't exactly centered, which was slightly misaligning
the coupling to the tranny shaft. I picked up a new screw, put it in, and it
shifted pretty good, but not perfect. So I crawled up front and found that
the front (shorter) shift rod was rubbing on the steering damper bolt
because the shift rod bushing is gone. As a temporary fix, I wrapped some
thin cardboard around the shift rod where it enters the tube, secured it
with some duct tape, and it shifts so smoothly now, I can't believe it!

Now I've got to replace that home-made cardboard bushing :-) Is there
supposed to be a bushing at the other end (rear) of the tube too?

Thanks NQ for bringing it up. This list rules!

&gt; Always remember - when installing the shifter plate, the long tab with the
&gt; bevel goes to the right (passenger side) and both tabs face up.
&gt; Look at one
&gt; and then this message will make sense.
