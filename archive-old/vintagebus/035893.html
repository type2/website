   My 65´ Kombi has the front instrument panel cut in the part of the 
 stereo was. I think the past owner wanted to put another kind of bigger 
 stereo instead the original and broke the panel.
   
   I dont know how fix the problem, notice that i cant have a hole new 
 panel instrument because i live in Mexico and it is almost impossible to 
 get one. I think i should make an implant or something.
 
 What do you think?....

unfortunately, it seems quite a number of splitties have had the radio hole
enlarged to fit later radios/stereos.  :(n     My 65 camper was like that- it
got welded up, but luckily it wasn't so bad, so we ould fab patches for it.
The piece I had from a dead bus I was going to transplant into mine went to
another bus guy on this list, for his splitty, whose radio hole was worse than
mine.   

As far as I see, 
you can fabricate a patch (what it should look like is helpful), 
or transplant a piece carefully, 
or as in my 59 SC, I put a radio block off plate in there that almost covers
all the hacked bits.
