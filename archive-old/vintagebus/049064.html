The Thing list had a neat URL, http://www.miata_dot_net/garage/tirecalc.html You puts in your old tire size, new tire size and it'll tell you the effect on the speedometer. Rev/mile, circumference, etc. in inch and metric. Scroll down to a different style calculator that'll give you a multi-size table. 

Vent access panels are easy to fabricate. Measure your stock one, get some aluminum or scrap sheet metal and make one bend in it and drill away. If it's heavy enough guage, you don't need the stiffening/style bead. With a gazillion screws 3 layers of reynolds wrap should work! Anybody have a lead on aircraft vents? 

Passing the hubcap... another Thing reference. Starting in the south east, a Thing door has been annointed as a baton. Left rear door to be exact, painted with the project name and inscribed with the carrier's names. It even has a built in pocket to hold pictures &amp; stories. Thing doors can be switched in about 45 seconds.

Madera Spring Fling is Sunday, April 30th. ~$15 to drive in, can of food to walk in. On the grass, under the trees at the Madera Fair Grounds. Good facilities and camping. The local organizers have push drags and Hot Wheel racing. It's a small, but friendly show. Gabe is usually there, the guys from Montana and other vendors. C'mon down, pit stop in Fresno with Karl or me. We're 30 miles south of Madera. Yosemite is up the road a few hours.
