&gt; Howdy,

&gt; After finding connecting heater tubes-from the 'heater mufflers' to the body

&gt; Smelly, exhaust.  I am assuming that there must be exhaust leaks in the heat
&gt; exchangers, therefore, they need to be replaced.  Any suggestions on the
&gt; best ones to get and from where?  FYI:  The Bus has a '74 Beetle DP motor in
&gt; it if that matters.

It might not be the exchangers.  How are your seals around the engine bay?
You might be pulling exhaust back in and sending it through the heater.
Even with good seals, you can get exhaust smell if the bus is stationary
or backing up.

If your valve covers are leaky you can also experience smelly heat.

Exchangers are pretty thick.  I've never seen one with an internal leak.
