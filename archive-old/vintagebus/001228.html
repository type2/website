No problem Thom and by the way your  rite i have never gotten up close and
personal with a RHD bus to this point, i feel i will sooner or later though,
thanks for the compliments.
As for Chris's post i wasn't trying to expand into the parts sector, but you
gotta do whut you gotta do to preserve the buses. If it means expanding then
we'll damn sure give it a whirl, Anybody gotta a big shop close by me they
wanna lease cheap ?,,grin,,,, later
