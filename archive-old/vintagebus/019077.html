Hey fellow listees
I have a question for all of the experts out there..
What solutions have any of you found to reduce the
wind noise/whistle from the wing windows?? My 67 Bus
gets so loud that I have to slightly open the window
to make it go away, and, this being winter and I live
at five thousand feet elevation, ITS COLD.
Anyone with good ideas?

Thanks....
Chuck Notmeyer
