This topic of ice chests and such for Westy's came up a year or so ago and
the general concensus then was that the ice block in a &quot;chest&quot; that has the
door on the side will cool marginal at best.  Too much cool air is lost
every time the door is opened.  You are better off just keeping some books
or tools in the refrigerator and buying an actual cooler/ice chest where the
lid is on top.  They work much better.
