Eric and Barb,

I have been following the thread on insulating a bus.  I have a couple of
questions.  How different/similar is the tar to the spray on undercoating?  It
was my impression that at least some of the spray on undercoatings are
basically diluted tar.  I suppose others are plastic based materials.  I agree
that the plastic based materials will do as you say and eventually let
moisture in.  If I were to use tar, does it have a smell?
