Subject: RE: [VB] Broken exhaust studs

Hey thanks for the tip but there was enough of the broken stud left to get a
grip with some vice grips.  I was able to get the studs out easily enough
but the threads were damaged which is why I ordered the time-sert kit.

Thomas,
    Just got in from the bar here in Tucson and read you message.  It
would not hurt to try and run a sharp 1/8&quot; expensive drill into the
broken stud and try to cut a hole straight through the thing.
