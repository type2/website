Hi David,
We tried this distributor about a year and a half ago.  Trying three of these 
in otherwise great condition resulted in having to set the static timing at 
12 degrees BTDC just to get 20 degrees BTDC _at_ 2,500 RPM to avoid heavy 
hesitation.  Which in turn ran the oil temp hotter.  Asked Jim if he had tech 
info on this model distributor and he said he hoped to get it soon, but he 
has not updated his web page on this stuff since JAN99.  
We went back to our vintage two piece points 010 distributor in our 1960 
panel that uses the same rotor, cap and points as the vintage 009 and 019 
distributors.   Eric&amp;Barb
