&lt;&lt; Others told me to get a &quot;heli-coil?&quot; and others mentioned an &quot;insert&quot; but,
 never having to deal with this in the past I'm a little puzzled. &gt;&gt;
Hi John,
NEVER use a heli-coil in anarea you take apart regularly!  BTDWT type of 
screwed up repair (That and broken easy outs in stuck/frozen fasteners!) by 
others way too often in USAF.  They have no locking system to keep them from 
unthreading out with the bolt/sparkplug.  Best to use a solid insert that has 
a locking system!  Check out Time-Sert for thier kits and yes they have a 
locking system built into them!   Eric&amp;Barb
