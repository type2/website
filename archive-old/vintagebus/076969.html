Subject: 67 riviera...floppy fan belt...rust on crank pulley...engine
  disaster

Okay, i didn't actually HAVE an engine diaster, but it could have gone that 
way.


After having replaced some brake parts on the 67 last week,   (yup that 
loosen the rear nut and drive trick did work to get he stuck drum off... just check 
it to see if the nut has come loose, cause when it did the bus handled 
something funky on the freeway)   it has sat lonely and abandoned, ignored in the 
garage.   Horrible!!~!!   So I took vanny white out today.   Put some gas in as 
the gauge read near R, and noticed the fan belt was floppy when I checked the 
oil.  And there was black stuff around the fuel pump/engine in that area.  

On further inspection the crank pulley itself had rust.   where the fan belt 
rides.  I figured this acts like sandpaper and wears the belt down.   I had 
seen this before on several buses, and one that was on a road trip last summer 
(not mine) had been 'going through fan belts'... well i suggested sanding the 
pulley down, but the engine was already making a bad noise and didn't get them 
home  :(

Not likely to overheat today in the mid 50s putting around town, but I wanted 
to avoid this happening to me.    When I got home, I removed the top nut, and 
used a wire brush on the lower pulley.   cranking it round so I could get the 
whole thing.   Then used sand paper, cranking it round to get the whole 
thing.   

(I was draining the oil at the time too, i have only put about 1000 miles on 
this mystery bus/motor, and the oil was dirty... been 500 miles since the last 
change)  after plugging up the hole underneath and inserting a suffficient 
quanity of oil, I started the bus up, and used an emery board on the crank pully 
while the engine was running (both front and back of the inside of teh 
groove... watch the fingers!!!!!).   

In this case, the upper pulley was chrome and newer and unrusted, so it 
didn;t need attention, but it can get funky too.

put fan belt assembly back together, moving shims around as needed.   Bus 
sounds really good.  Like a sewing machine  :)    And since I messed with the 
front door mechanisms, the drivers door shuts like a dream, AND both front doors 
lock and unlock with the pretty L series \x/ key that starts the bus.   Wow.  

needs shocks though.   and... the passenger wiper arm fell off a few weeks 
ago, and...   well, it's old.   getting better though.  :)
