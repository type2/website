&gt; Sheesh, it feels like I haven't posted a message in
&gt; years.  How the hell is everyone??!!  I've been
&gt; caught up mostly with life itself, and very little
&gt; in buses.  That better change soon.
&gt; 
&gt; Just got a call this morning from R.K. Smith at Hot
&gt; VW's.  He came up in January to shoot my '59 Westy,
&gt; and told me this morning that it will be in the June
&gt; 2002 issue.
&gt; 
&gt; Unfortunately it's just a plain ole, run-o-the-mill
&gt; stock restoration, nothing fancy like the &quot;slammin
&gt; jammin $30k barndoor deluxe panel
&gt; what-cha-ma-call-it&quot;, so it might go totally
&gt; unnoticed by the VW crowd.  I thought I would give
&gt; everyone who is interested a heads up to be on the
&gt; lookout for it.
&gt; 
&gt; I knew I should have put bags under it.
