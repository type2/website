One man does not make an army, but an army does make the man.

Out of all of this discontent that many of you fell justified to vent I
have a GOOD story to share.  As you all know Dawn never made it to the
SOTO or The Classic meet this year due to engine failure.  I e-mailed
Dave about Dawns predicament but he had already left for the show.
Needless to say not knowing Dawn's plight he saved Dawn's swap site all
day.  Well a few days after the show after finding out about Dawn
breaking down in Oregon Mr. Heard graciously reserved her swap spot for
next years show with this years money.  This was very generous of him to
do, considering that The Classic does not give refunds or credit for
their show.  IMOH slaming a person without any huge justified reason
isn't called for on the list.  Reserve it for P-mail.
