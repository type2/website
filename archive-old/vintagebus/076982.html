Subject: Re: [VB] Metal brake line length

My local good brake shop will make metal brake lines to the length you 
specify.  You might ask at yours about that. 

  I ended up w/ 12mm nuts instead of 11mm, but that's okay, much better than 
the busted metal brake line I was replacing..

I am a cheap S.O.B.! Therefore I hate paying shipping
costs on parts. Anyway, my FLAPS has metal brake lines
that are 20 inches long in stock.  I see from online
parts sources that rear metal lines on a 67 bus are
21.85&quot; long.  So, my question is:  can I get a 20&quot;
metal line to work or will that extra 1.85&quot; be
problematic?
To order the right lines from internet source, it will
cost me more for shipping than it will for the parts,
and I just hate that ;^)
