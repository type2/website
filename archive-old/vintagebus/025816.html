Hello List,

After some observation, I've concluded that my new tranny must have been
stuck in 3rd...

I've studied how the forks in the nosecone work. Apparently, the top
fork is 3rd(in)/4th(out), the middle fork is 1st(in)/2nd(out), and the
bottom fork is R(out). This is just from reasoning and doing a little
geometry in my head...

I've got them all moving freely now (they click from &quot;in&quot; to neutral to
&quot;out&quot;), but the bottom fork doesn't come out as far as the other 2 forks
do, so I'm wondering if its going fully into reverse...

Tomorrow I will get a new throttle cable from work (to replace the one I
broke last night), new rear tranny mounts, a gasket for the nosecone,
and a couple of brake lines (from the hoses to the backing plates).
Hopefully I'll have my baby back on the road this weekend...

david
