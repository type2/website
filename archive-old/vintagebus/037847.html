&lt;&lt; Results?  No real difference between the 2 sets in terms of ride quality.
I consider myself able to tell since I can tell when my front end needs
greasing.  :)  It did feel like I had a bit more cornering ability with the
gas shocks in the rear.  &gt;&gt;
Hi Everett,
Great to hear the results.  Would also be interesting to hear how it would do
with the different shocks with a load on board.  We found out the hard way
how badly cheapie tires will ride with a load.  You hit a pot hole and start
front to rear motion in the bus and if you are on the concrete slab type road
the slab bumps will increase the oscillations more and more until becoming
dangerous.  We literally had to put on the brake on and knock out the motion
by slowing down.   Eric&amp;Barb
