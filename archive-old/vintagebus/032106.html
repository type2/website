I remember seeing in a hot rod magazine a while back a small antenna that was 
designed to fit in small laces inside the vehicle.  360* reception and 
supposedly worked really well.  It was a small black thing named CAT 
something or other.
It was over $80 though :(  Anyone know what im talking about?
