Subject: Split Bus Campout

The Split Bus Campout North of Fort Bragg this past weekend was great.
With the exception of the cold, I believe everyone had a good time. I
took a non-Bus VW and towed one of my tent trailers behind. I ran into a
Bus list member who was possibly interested in trading my other tent
trailer for a VW he has. I'll have to contact him, or maybe he'll
contact me after reading this since I don't have his email (hint hint)
