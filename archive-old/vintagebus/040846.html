Don't have any busses anymore, but I'll muse about the
ones I don't have any more.  In purchasing sequence.

'64 Deluxe - $900 in 1980, 54 mph tops, absolutely
reliable, rusted out rockers, rain tight roof and
this was in Seattle.  rebuilt engine, sold for $900
in 1984.  Really wish I still had this bus.

'67 Deluxe - hated this bus, bought for $1300 in '81.
Every time I drove it, something major broke.  Sold
in '84 for $1500.

Sold 2 above for a '76 ASI camper, traveled 20K in 6
months, rolled it, drove it home.  Absolutely reliable.
If we hadn't rolled it, we would still have it.

'81 Westy, lived in it for a few months, daily driver
for 5 years, parked for awhile, daily driver for 5 more
years.  Sold it in '96.  Loved the camper layout.

2nd '81 for parts for the above.  Never ran, sold '96.

'64 Kombi - $200 in '95, no engine, root beer brown,
cut wheel wells, sold it for $900.  Major regrets for
selling it.  An easy project to get back into busses.

'67 Hard Top Deluxe, yellow over blue, black interior.
PO was stupid.  I over paid, spent $, sold it at loss, 
next owner found out how bad the motor was.  I only
drove it to town once, for the new owner.

Still have the '67 Sqbk I've had since '78 though,
but not running in 10 years.

Jeff
