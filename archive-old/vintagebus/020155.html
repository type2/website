Tore down the front brakes on the 67 Westy this
(Thursday) evening. 
- Passenger side was pretty normal but had slight
glazing on either ends of each shoe. Double checked
part number and visual fit. All OK. Replaced with set
originally intended for the 63 EZ camper. Not used
when that bus was all OK.
- Drivers side showed more shoe contamination. I
suspected seal failure as there was evidence of grease
on the backing plate. Shoes were pretty dark on either
end of each shoe.
I scrubbed each drum with 60 grit sandpaper, cleaned
and reassembled each side then adjusted. No time to
test drive. 
I did notice slight movement of wheels when holding
tire at 12 and 6 and rocking. Perhaps need to
adjust/R&amp;R K&amp;L's.
Second guessing myself I intend to pick up a new set
of grease seals on the way home from work Friday
evening. Why spoil the new set of shoes and repeat the
same mistake?
Thanks for all of the suggestions and insights. See
you all in Prescott, AZ!
