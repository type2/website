I realize that it is not friday and this topic should be typed on friday
but I have no choice but to type this letter because of the elation that
I feel right now!

If anybody lives in NC or VA and was around for those gale force winds
that blew through today you know what I am talking about.  For those who
were not around, there were winds up to 60 miles per hour reported near
my house.  The day started as normal but I decided to take the bus to
work today.  I plan on pulling the engine next weekend so I wanted to
get a head start. I was working outside all day and was amazed at the
winds today.  The rain began about one hour before I left from work.
The power went off at work so I decided to drive home since I could not
work on the bus.  (My work has airlifts and pneumatic tools).  I stopped
at the store and saw the most beautiful, complete rainbow in my life.
It was over my house which is located right down the road from the
store.  These little kids came up to me and smiled at me while I was
getting in the bus to finish the trip home.  They waved and said that
they wanted to find the end of the rainbow.( Isn't youth the coolest).
I drove down the road and to my amazement, a huge tree had fallen in my
driveway.  It landed on my little ford escort and crushed the front of
the car.  I jumped out of the bus and screamed for joy.  I was so happy
because I ALWAYS park my bus beside the escort.  If I had not taken it
to work today, my bus would have been crushed by the shear size of this
pine.  I was so happy I could not speak.  True, my car is crushed but I
still have my dream which I have fought long and hard to get, my bus.  I
could not even begin to think what would of happened if that tree would
of hit my bus.  The rainbow to me was a sign from the heavens about how
fortunate it was that I took my bus today.  Thanks for listening and
hope it was not TOO sappy!
