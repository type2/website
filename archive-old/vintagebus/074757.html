&gt;Saw that creature at the Classic- makes John Jones' BD panel look like a VN
resto- It was so ugly/tacky, that I assumed it was done very tongue-in-butt,
however, there was obviously alot of moolah spent on it, so maybe my sense

Maybe the designer was trying to get attention/create controversy/invoke the
