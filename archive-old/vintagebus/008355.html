Hi,

I tend to agree with Eric and Barb. Use the Cold Galvanize compound.
95% zinc. It is available from several vendors. Rustoleum is one of
them. I used this in the gutter of my bus about 20 years ago. Result,
no rust except where the paint was chipped off or scratched from my
roof carrier. I have also painted a muffler with this stuff. Result,
no rust for quite some time. I first tested for high temp by painting
a piece of sheet metal and then heating it from below with a torch to
a dull red. The finish was still intact so presumably still protecting
the metal.

Chris
