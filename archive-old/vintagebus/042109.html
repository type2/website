&gt; Anyone have a spare $50K to spend on an:
&gt; 1944 Volkswagen : amphibious Porsche 166
&gt; 
&gt; Humm... but this thing cost $200original!

Funny, they called it a 2-door.  I don't think that schwimmers had doors,
did they?  Interesting that they advertise it as being perfect, but then
say that the exhaust system needs rebuilding.  The machine gun is a nice
rare accessory, probably more rare than ambulance fans!  Just the thing
for those moments of road rage!  :)
