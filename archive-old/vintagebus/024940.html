 See this year`s RAFFLE BUS at the OCTO / CLASSIC this coming weekend. We are 
currently working on a new website that should be up in the very near future. 
This year`s bus is a 60` kombi that was donated to the club by fellow listee 
members MATT&amp; KATIE.  As you know ( or don`t ) everything needed to refurbish 
this bus is a collective effort between club members, private individuals, VW 
parts vendors and such. Without the collective efforts of said people(s) this 
little venture would not be. So to all that have donted in the past, present 
or future THANK YOU  from the entire ARIZONA BUS CLUB family. So if you 
happen to be at the events this coming weekend, just look for the A.B.C booth 
come on up say hi and check out the RAFFLE BUS.
