ok, I tried editing this for bus only content, but these new Type2 mail
filters are a pain so I'm just sending the whole thing.  Take what you like
from it but remember I know nothing more about this bus than you do...blah
blah blah

Happy Friday

I was driving through Wisconsin to Upper Michigan late one night
(mid-August) and drove past a beautiful old T2 split-window parked in a
guy's driveway with a for-sale sign on it.  Of course, I had to pull over
and take a look--the sign on the front window said $6500, which is out of
my budget but as I was walking around it, the owner came out the front
door.

We ended up chatting for about three hours, and during the course of our
conversation he mentioned a 1963 split-window T2 he happens to know about
near him (Marinette, Wisconsin).  It belonged to a 91-year-old farmer who
recently died, and has been sitting in the field for 15 years.  It
definitely would need work if someone decided to restore it--but Dana said
he'd been by to see it and it has all the original parts and was actually,
body-wise (except for the floor pan) in really good shape.  I was hoping to
get it, but now it looks as if I'll be moving to Oregon in a few months,
and I know I won't be able to get the bus in shape to make the trip by
then.

If there's anyone out there in VW -land who wants to save this baby from
the local crusher, please give Dana Cudnohusky a call--he seemed like a
really decent person from our conversation and he told me he'd be willing
to help someone find out who has the title right now and get in touch with
them.  The price should be well under $500, but it all depends on your
negotiating skills with the owners (who apparently have been tipped off
that some VW fans might pay more than scrap metal price for the bus).

Here's his phone number:  715-732-1052.

I haven't talked with Dana since the night I met him; their answering
machine now says they are out of town until September 8th, so if you're
interested please give him a call after that!
