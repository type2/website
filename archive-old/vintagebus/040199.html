How did VW &quot;attach&quot; the body panels to the crossmembers (past the rockers)? 
Is this all one, solid piece bent over at the rocker, then welded? (in 
theory, making it easy to cut and reweld in new steel, right?) Any tips on 
&quot;mating&quot; together panels at the rockers?
I studied the Bently manual, but it's not giving me what I need.
Thanks,

Jon
