  &gt; Volks,
 
  &gt; I am at my wits end.  The '80 won't start and I
  don't know why :-( &gt; &gt;

 well, you could at least check and mention a few basics, such as does the 
starter turn over or not?   If not, are the headlights bright?   If it does 
turn the engine round, do you get a spark?  (as per idiot book direction)  
Are you sure there is gas in the tank?
