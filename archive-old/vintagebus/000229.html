Sorry for the belated reply.  Steven asked: 
&gt;  For so long I have avoided investing in any kind of sand blasting
&gt;  equipment.  .....
&gt;  I think one of the concerns is the breathing of the dust...
&gt;  What equipment do you use to protect yourself?
Sandblasting (and sanding drywall for that matter) was no fun until I got a 
fresh air respirator.  Now I actually enjoy the zen of blasting.  What makes 
a fresh air unit nice for me is the no fogging up of the eye protection (i.e. 
hood for sandblasting) so you can see what you are doing.  It is also 
generally nicer air to breath.  Problem is that these units are expensive, 
especially the professional ones.  I got a consumer model &quot;HobbyAir&quot; 
manufactured by Axis Products, Inc. 155A industrial Drive, Gilberts, IL 60136 
toll free: 888-458-1322  phone: 847-836-1664 fax: 847-836-1530.  I got mine 
from FleecedWood (Eastwood) for about $380.  You might be able to get it 
cheaper if you look around or contact the manufacturer.  I know that Len has 
them at http://www.autobodystore_dot_com/ but don't know how much they cost.  He 
also carries other fresh air units.  When you get the unit you will notice 
that it did not cost near $380 to build the thing.  Sure it uses noncorrosive 
parts, but I think you are paying a lot for the manufacturer's insurance 
policy.  Liability on these things is probably steep.  If you have a lot of 
blasting to do or want to use any isocyanate paints, these units are 
correspondingly nice and required.
