I have a 66 that is poping out of gear in 4th. Also, if I am not careful,
it grind when I put it in first from a stand still.

Any ideas on what it might be, and how much it would cost to fix?

It sounds like the tranny is going.    But there are a couple things you can 
do.

1)   Check the shift linkage.  make sur ethe little bolts holding the shift 
couple (just forward of the trans) are not backing out .  usually they are 
8mm square headed, and if loose will affect shifting.  You can check to make 
sur ethe 13mm bolts holding the shift stick up front aren't loose, which 
means the stick will move.  Also check under the front where the front and 
rear part of the shift rod are connected.    Is this how it was when you got 
the bus, or a new development?   

2)  Change your gear oil.  This wont fix it, but can help it somewhat.    
Drive the bus around to warm and stir it up, drive home,   and undo both 17mm 
allen plugs at the bottom of the tranny.   (have rags handy).   Loosen lugs 
bolts on bother rear wheels,   Jack up one side and take the wheel off.   
Chock the wheels, both of the other side front and back.   you will want the 
brake off and it out of gear, so be safe, use a jack stand and ut the wheel 
under the motor.  Drain that side Reduction Gear Box (more 17mm allen plugs). 
   When the center is drained, put the plugs back in (after cleaning the 
magnets in them).   feel for sludge, chunks in the bottom of the tranny case. 
   Your tranny boots are good?   no rips? tears, cracks?    Okay, Plug the 
bottom of the RGBox, and fill it till air bubbles up.  Spinning the stub axle 
shaft helps, as does warming the gear oil up  (leave in sun).   I like the 
slick 50 gear oil myself.   okay, put the fill plug in, wheel on, (adjust 
brakes?)  let it down, switch the chocks, jack the other side up, wheel off,  
drain and fill the second RGBox.      Okay, now all wheels on the ground, 
fill the center section last.      

chunks in the oil?   coppery sheen?  

You can drive with a funky tranny, but it will get worse so budget for it.  
Changing the oil will help extend its life, but will not fix it.   Use a 
bungee to hold it in 4th.    A rebuildt tranny seems around $400-500 for a 
center section, more if you need the RGBoxes redone.  This is handing them 
the center section, meaning you pulled the tranny and pulled the axles off.   
 

You may know someone who has a used tranny,  but mystery trannys can also be 
as bad (or worse) than what you have so if it is a mystery I would go the 
rebuild route as switching a tranny is a bunch of work.   Well, not as much 
the second time, as the bolts are not rusted and so its easier to do.
