hi all!!

we are much more than u think on Type 2 list, less on vintage bus because
here the weather make rust on a car as common as the cloud on the sky :)

we have our web site from our French connection at, many of us go to the
Vermont VW show in September in Jonshonville.

Those time we stored our VW because it already snowed, and we speak about
Weber freezin... on of us is looking to replace the air filter element of a
weber to an air filter from a plymouth voyager 85 (with thermostat in)  that
sit-fit on the weber carb so we can get hot air from the head when weather
is cold!!


Sorry if what i said looked bad,  but we all know here the difference from
Bus Boy, Bus Depot and Old Volks home... many of us buy from Calimport and
Bus Depot...and with everybodys experience they always seem to have problem
sometimes.

I think we could say that the best way to avoid problem is to order via
Internet with VW number! it is easier for me to type &quot;MUFFLER part no
123456XYZ&quot; than to spell it on the phone, ha ha ha, at leats it worked for
me!!


Hey BTW,if you are as curiuos as i am at web site for VW, here are a few
link from us!!
