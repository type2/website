Subject: Compressors and Sandblasting

Rex, split list, 
&gt;  So...what SCFM should
&gt;  I need to do blasting. 
It all depends on the size of the outlet nozzel on the sandblaster.  A 
smaller nozzel will allow you to use a smaller capacity compressor and 
maintain 80-100 psi, but you will be blasting a smaller area, so it takes 
longer, but it works.  A larger nozzel will require larger compressor but 
gets the job done faster.  Two stage compressors are nicer than single stage. 
 My recommendation is to buy the largest capacity compressor you can afford 
and then get a nozzel which maintains 80-100 psi with that compressor.  I use 
a 10.5cfm_at_90psi rated 6.5hp 60gal compressor with a  3/32inch carbide nozzel 
on the blaster and it keeps 80 psi okay (non-stop) but the compressor runs 
almost all the time.  If I went to 7/64 nozzel, the compressor would not keep 
up, so a 1/64 inch difference in nozzel size makes a big difference.  If I 
got another compressor, I would get a two stage rated at 12cfm_at_90psi.
