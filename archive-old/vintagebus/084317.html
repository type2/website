Subject: [VB] Lifespan of a full flowed type 1 in a bus

Hi All -

	good advice from Lou:
&quot;...doubt the theory of  'double life' but having a modern spin on 
filter as  compared to the OG screen has to be a plus. ... It also 
provides a venue for an external oil cooler if the type of VW you are 
  driving or the type of driving you do warrants it.

It is vitally important to use quality components when doing the
installation, use high pressure steel braided hoses with the correct
fittings, not rubber hoses and hose clamps.. ..&quot;
-------------

I'll just say that for those who want the advantages of a full flow 
filter, but aren't at first certain where to finally mount it, or who 
are hesitant to pony up the money for steel hoses - you _can_ use high 
quality 1/2&quot; hose such as the red Gates hi-temp that Berg sells.

As they claim, this is much better than the thinner walled, black oil 
hose that the flaps will sell you.  I've used this on both my bus and 
sedan now for many years.  For instance, after five years of near 
daily use on the sedan in Aridzona, the hose is stiff and shows some 
outer cracks where routed through the extractor exhaust, but is in no 
danger of failure.

On the fresh bus motor, I used most of a six foot piece, about five 
feet on the sedan.  Hose clamps work fine, though you must be prepared 
to cut it off the barbed end of the fittings when replacing.  I carry 
a fresh one foot+ piece so that in case of hose failure I can just 
temporarily route the oil directly back into the case, bypassing the 
filter.

Nick
