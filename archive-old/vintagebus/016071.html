I drove this bus to the Phoenix Bug a Rama about a
month ago from Jim's house in Phoenix. 
The only drawback is that since the spare tire is
mounted on the back hatch, putting extra weight there,
it did come open while driving and lose its hubcap.
This happened on a surface street, and the guy behind
honked seeing the back hatch down, so I pulled over to
shut it.  The back hatch of an ambulance folds down,
not up, and the safety latch to hold it in case of
this event was undone, oops, secured it and all was
fine.
--------------------
Ellis &quot;Clara-fies&quot; by saying that I *always* keep the
rear hatch locked plus always use a safety catch setup
that had been installed on the interior. After giving
Clara the tour of the bus I spaced relocking and
rehooking the saftey latch thingie. It was the typical
pre-show packing panic while visiting with Clara as
our weekend guest plus cat juggling the baby, wife,
packing three vehicles and trying not to chain smoke
myself in to oblivion.
The rear hatch locking handle jiggled loose at the
first intersection and came open. The rear
hatch/handle/lock etc works perfectly fine as long as
the owner remembers to lock and latch. &lt;Doh!&gt;

Thanks to Clara for the good witness. She is the only
other person besides myself who has ever driven this
bus in North America.
