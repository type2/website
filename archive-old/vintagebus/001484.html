Hi All,

I was looking at wheels yesterday evening and I noticed that the following
wheels would not fit on my 59 dc front hubs:

ansens, raders, american 5 spokes.

BRMs, flat 4 brms, and empi 2 pc 5 spokes will fit.

I am running type 3 rear hubs so they are not a problem.

So, the question is:  how can I run these other types of rims?
Should I use a later front hub?
If so, what's involved in the swap?

TIA
David
