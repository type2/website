Here are the various &quot;pans&quot; that are posssible

&quot;Pedal pan&quot; - goes under the pedal assembly - these go all
the way back to the barndoor ere and thru the lagwagen (68-9) era.  My '54 RHD
has *two* pedal pans - one big one, like a normal BD ('cept the
steering box is on the wrong side) and a *second* one which is
kind of like a box which covers the bootms of the accellerator and brake
pedals.  I haven't seen this one on LHD BD's, but that and 50 cents will
get you a cup of coffee.

&quot;Splash pan&quot; or &quot;bumper pans&quot; - these go on the insside corners of
the rear bumpers to keep water from splashing up on the body.  They also
have a small rubber searl which goes between the pan and thebumper.  These
splash pans are different for ribbed and non-ribbed bumpers, and for ribbed 
bumpers, there is a special pickup version to match the truck bumpers.

&quot;Belly pan&quot; - sunroof and double-door models had an additional
&quot;sub-floor&quot; which boxed in the frame members underneath.  Basically 3 big 
pieces of flat steel with stampings for rigidity.

Let's go all the way and mention the small plate that is on the rear
of the cargo floor on barndoor buses, which covers the shift linkage
, like on a bug.

&gt; Hi! I'm confused. Other than the pan that goes under the cab area and 
&gt; covers the pedals, is there another kind of pan for under my bus?
