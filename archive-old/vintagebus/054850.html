Subject: Re: [VB] Lost Causes

If you are looking at restoring a &quot;lost cause&quot; bus and don't live in Cali or
the southwest there are only a handful of options.  Kelly aka Metwiz has
been around for a while and does quality work.  I have seen his operation
and he really does know busses.  He and his crew do great work.  He does the
rust repair &amp; body work, you have to find someone else to do the paint.  He
also sells parts if you want to attempt it yourself.  He has been a great
resource for me.

The other great source is Kustum Coach Werks in Grand Junction, Colorado.
They are doing my Binz.  They are a complete shop and both bodywork and
paint.  Top quality work.  I'm sure most listees are familiar with his
recent custom double door sunroof walkthrough slammed Barndoor panel.
Believe me, that bus was a lost cause when he started.

You an check out what they have done to the Binz at:

&gt; &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;When I went to the local restoration shop, he looked at me and
&gt; dead-panned &quot;there is a 20 month waiting list. why don't you find
&gt; someone who works on vw's&quot;.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;  Well print this e-mail and tell him i have a longer waiting list than he
&gt; does probably, and i do almost only VW's. I just spent 20 months restoring
&gt; the 56 Standard sunroof,  and the same people delivered a 56 Kombi sunroof
&gt; to me when they picked it up, now its awaiting its turn in the shop.
&gt; From what i have seen of the work most of these dudes do your better off
to
&gt; find someone who does buses anyway, regular body shops have no idea of how
&gt; to restore a bus anyway and they  don't feel they are worth the effort.
&gt; (shows how smart they are huh?).
&gt; Put yours on a trailer and send it to me or we'll arrange a pick-up for a
&gt; fee. 8 times outta 10 i get the ones every one else is skerd of. (Grin )
i'm
&gt; a transplanted Tn redneck, i don't sker easily.
