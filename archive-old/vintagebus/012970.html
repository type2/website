I have examples of Aussie buses on my page: they didn't have
the lower set of vents, only the uppers, and I've seen one and
two column configurations.

&gt;   if it has the standard upper vents in the rear of the bus,plus a second
&gt; additional set of vents it could be from australia.
&gt; where i believe they used two sets of upper vents.
&gt; -bench seat panels have one row of upper vents per side
&gt; -walk-thrus panels no upper vents
&gt; -australian bench seat panels two rows of upper vents per side
&gt; any aussies out there to confirm?
