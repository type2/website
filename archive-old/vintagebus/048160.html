Subject: Las Vegas help?
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

Are there any listees in the Las Vegas, Nevada area that can help us?  A 
friend's daughter had her '67 pop-top Westy severely hit in the nose, and we 
need a place to store it until we can get out from Albuquerque to pick it up. 
 The bus may be gone, but the Westy interior is perfect and complete.  Help 
us save something if you can!

TIA
