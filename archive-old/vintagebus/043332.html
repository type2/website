&gt;I was wondering if anyone had a reference sheet that could look up and
&gt;engine ID number and tell me what year and model this engine came from?
&gt;The number is 1-4-3-2.  Thanks for your assistance.

No WAY!  That has to be one of the three surviving examples of the
one-day-only-production fuel-injection Kubel Type 34 Barndoor Oval
engine case!  Worth at least six figures on eBay.  Legend has it
that Ferdinand himself did the machine work on these cases.  The
fuel system was also a very rare and special design that got 200
MPG on water - if you have the original fuel system, better be
quiet about it or the Oil Industry Hit Squad will soon show up at
your door!

(PS - I once saw an German item in a surplus catalog advertised as being
 made by &quot;Bauart Gepruft&quot;...I think they're a subsidiary of Zundfolge.)
