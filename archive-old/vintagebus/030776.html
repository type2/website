Hi all,
Some of you may remember my moaning about how long Winter was lasting
around here. I had not had Frodo home from storage since before
Thanksgiving. Well the last of the snow pile in front of my house melted
this week. Saturday was too windy to rake the yard so I brought my bus
home and did a little work on it.
I installed the new taillight units and front turn signal lenses I got
from Ronnie and they are beautiful, bright and I feel safe again knowing
the folks behind me have a clue that I am stopping or turning. My old
taillights were so dull that even if the bad connections in the
taillights didn't weaken them they did not shine very bright.
We had the monthly meeting of the Omaha VW Club on Tuesday and there
were more busses there than anything else. I warned them that we were
taking over. Trying to get a little spirit of competition going in
preparation for our July 21 Show &amp; Shine and First Annual Camp out. The
future's so bright I gotta wear shades.
