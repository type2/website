Subject: Oh dear, VanBondo's in Nesting Mode (again)...

Damn, Why is it that every time that my wife and I have a child I want to buy
and sell every vehicle known to man? The wife wants to redecorate everything in
sight as if we have income. Paula's bet is that we will have a son by the end
of Memorial Day Weekend. My luck it will come on OCTO/Classic Weekend...
In reality it will be more like &quot;Fear Factor&quot; challange of passing a 16lb
bowling ball through your uterus and then trying to afford it for 21 years...
hahahah! It better not look like Kyle or JP or I'll be miffed! ;-)
