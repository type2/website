While in SanDiego a month ago, I spotted a bug with what looked like Fuchs
but upon closer inspection, they were of the wide 5 205 mm bolt pattern and
not the closer later style Porsche pattern.

Anyone know if these are real Fuchs or are they some repop item... if
they're vintage, know anyone with a set for sale????
