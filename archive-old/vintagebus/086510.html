Subject: Bumper color is it white, or is it &quot;off&quot; white?

I've painted our '65 panel bus, and now I am ready to paint the
bumpers (they are currently primer black...eeech).

Question is: The upper portion of the bus is Pale Blue (which is a
silly name for the color, which really is an off white with a greenish
tint in my color blind eyes, a standard VW color). Was it stock to have
the &quot;white&quot; bumpers the same color as the &quot;top&quot; color (in this case Pale Blue),  or were they an
actual white?

Thanks!

Jon
