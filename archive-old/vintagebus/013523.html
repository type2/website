Well I got the horse hair all cleaned up with TSP and it looks good...
Now I was wondering about the air intake assembly.... I have noticed on a
lot of my friends canisters the air intake tube has a little door flap
with a wieghted arm that stays down to keep the air intake tube
blocked.... But I have also noticed on a lot of them that the wieght has
been removed to keep the flap open all the time..... Which one is
correct? Of course mine has the leaded wieght to keep it shut all the
time which makes me wonder how air passes through to the cleaner? Thanks
again.... Always something new to learn.
