Subject: [VB] Roof Racks...
Message-ID: &lt;384A78CD.CBB6F54B_at_empire_dot_net&gt;

    Hi Folks,

    I just found a stash of roof racks...  5-6 Bus (full, 3/4, and 1/2
length), couple of squareback racks, and a couple Bug metal racks. One
Bug wood slat rack, but I'm not sure the owner will part with that one.

    This guy also has a '68 Panel with just over 40K on it, and what's
left of a '60 doublecab (gates look pretty good, frame is held together
with pressure-treated 2&quot;x4&quot;s).

    My question is what are they worth..??  Found most of the clamps, we
think (just have to sort them out, they're all in a 5gal. bucket).

    I'm negotiating with the owner to help him sell the barn &amp; garage
full of VW stuff before he heads for FL when his wife retires in 2
years.

    He has a dozen or so early ('50, '51, '53) Beetles, a couple Ovals,
a super clean '66, the '68 panel, and the '60 DC (strictly parts Bus) of
which he is going to keep just a couple...

    This guy does have an idea of what this stuff is worth as he has
been in the V-dub business since the early '60s, so no super cheap deals
(prices will be fair, unlike lots of items recently seen on E-bay).
Once we get together on % of commission, then I'll be setting up a
website with as complete an inventory as possible (Bus Lists will get
URL several months before I start adding it to the various search
engines).  We will NOT be posting anything on E-bay!

    JonR
