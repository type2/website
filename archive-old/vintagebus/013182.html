Volks, Thanks all for the input on my timing problem.  Foo-neck Betty is doin'
much better.  Most of the problems I wuz having had to do with the fact that
the engine's cylinders/pistons/heads were new.  The engine needs time to break
in.  Valves are still seating themselves, and the rings are tight -part of the
reason for the engine running warmer than what I'm use to.  It passes the
dipstick test, but again warmer than I like it.

I've had to adjust the valves, as half of them were tight after the 100 mile
road test.  The timing wuz, in fact, a little off -the result of on-the-fly
adjustments during the road test.  After resetting the valve clearance,
Clarence, I checked the timing and it wuz hovering around 7 deg BTDC and I've
since moved this to what I think is 5... FNB seems to have appreaciated the
attention.  Prolly do another oil change before heading to the Cape this
weekend.

Oh, BTW, POR-15 black paint does not werk on the muffler.  Gooped off after
the first fire-up.  And what smoke/smell, koughf koughf!  Actually, I made
sure I wasn't breathing any of the fumes...  I do like the way the engine tin
came out using that stuff though.  Did a good job binding up the surface
rust...

I had forgotten about the small oil leak behind the engine timing pully, so I
still need to do that..  

I'd also like to help out Steve, so let me know how this can be done..
