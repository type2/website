I am sure someone else has said this, but buses do not have separate bodys 
and pans.   so you cant swap them like you can with a bug.  Depending on the 
rust of the 21 window,   I am sure you (or your friend) can find repair 
panels    Usually bses have rust in the rockers- that is the bit of the side 
that curves in.  There are inner and outer rockers.  there are also 
outriggers, and jack point.  and often holes in the front floor.     Hope the 
main frame is still good.  Sunroof buses also have sub floor pans for 
structiral strength, which may be in doubtful condition.   You, I mean your 
friend,  will find there are a lot more pieces to a bus than a bg, especially 
a samba bus.   If you get a copy of the Transporter Workshop Manual 1963 
edition now back in print and available through Bentley, there is a nice 
section show the bits of metal folded together to make a bus.

oi now you want to do a roof transplant. 

   sure of course you will keep it forever.  

Now hmm, your friend with the nice bod gets this ratty samba, and he wants 
this done to it, then decided to do this or  that, and even though you dont 
like bodywork,  you are willing to do all this cut and weld?  why not send to 
it the metal wiz or someone, or find a nicer bus?   

Yes, I thought samba was the deluxes (21 or 23 window buses).    heard the 
brits call them that.

Greetings all! Walt here again. I had to change my email for this group

being as how AOL6 insists on putting html in all emails. Anyways, on to my

question

    My buddy recently purchased a 67 21 window rag. His bod isn't too

bad(needs the usual rockers, doglegs, and has some minor window lip rot),

but after I finally got to see it today, I noticed his frame rails are shot.

I have a 65 that I am parting out and it has perfect frame rails. I don't

think I need to explain what I am getting at. I swap pans on type 1's all

the time, but it doesn't appear to be as easy on a bus. Any ideas????


P.S.-What exactly is a Samba? I originally thought it referred to a 21

window or the like but lately I have seen it when referring to trucks as

well. Is this like an option package or something? lol. Seriously, I dont

know and was just curious. Vote me in for stupid question of the week, I

dont care! Thansk again!
