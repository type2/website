Subject: RE: [VB] Nitpicky question

Does anyone have any spares of &quot;that rubber block&quot; or know how to make
one?

Thanks,

You shouldn't have to use any glue.  It's got a prickly thing on the top
that goes into the seal for the entire sliding window area.  And then
there's a small rubber block that hold it in at the bottom.  The last
screw that holds the metal strip with 4 indentions on it (for the
sliding window to latch into) also goes into that rubber block to keep
it in place.  If you need this explained a little better, just ask.  I
replaced the seals right there not long after I bought my bus.

&gt; Volks,
&gt;
&gt; The metal&quot;brace&quot; that is glued onto the non-sliding portionof the 
&gt; front door windows on my bus have come away from the glass.  What sort

&gt; of adhesive will do the trick?
