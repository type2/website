It *used* to belong to the Crandalls, who were selling it _at_ one
point in time for $24k *without* the westy trailer.  It's a nice
rig, I saw it in person at the Sacramento Bug-O-Rama one time - they'd
trailered it down from Washington.  My only issue with the vehicle
was the sub-standard quickie re-spray; there was paint all over
the rubber bits, etc.  For a $25k car, you can at least spring for
some new window seals...  

They used to be on the list, but I don't see them sub'd any more.

I like how the guy was trying to hype the 356 market, which everywhere
else appears to be all but flat.
