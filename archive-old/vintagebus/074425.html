Subject: turn signal quick fix

Hi all - I have the switch apart on the 60 dc and all cleaned up with 
contact cleaner, and for a couple of tries, I had all blinkers working. 
  However, the contact inside the switch for the driver's rear is very 
shady and loose inside.  Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't.  I 
guess I'll have to try to find a new switch, but for now:

Can I just splice the rear wire into the front wire down at the 5 wire 
connector?  When I jump these two connections inside the switch with a 
small screwdriver, everything seems to work fine, including brake 
lights.  I will be fully going through everything on this bus, and 
returning it as close to stock as I can, but I've only got 4 days left 
on my temp, and need to drive it to dmv 3 miles away for a vin check to 
complete the registration.  Just want to be safe for now.
