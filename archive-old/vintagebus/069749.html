Subject: Re: [VB] Internal Radio Antenna?

I mounted my antenna to the left front bumper bracket and it comes up just
inside of the headlight. It is a 3 section mast and I keep it below the
windsheild level. 98% of the people never even see the antenna or even know
it is there. They just ask what is that white thing(my EMPI antenna ball).
