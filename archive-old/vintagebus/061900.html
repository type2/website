Subject: Re: [VB] steering box

The 66 standard my then bf was driving wouldn't turn the front wheels one 
winter morning.  The water in the steering box had frozen.  Okay, that bus 
had sat in the low part of a field the previous winter, so it was sort of  in 
a seasonal pond. 

I didn't change the steering box oil in my 65 till I had had it a couple 
years.  Good God! There was water in it!.  Never sat in a soggy pond AFAIK.

I think draining the oil is not a bad idea, actually.  Ya, you undo the 4 
bolts on the bottom of the box.   I'd spray some lube through it to help wash 
all those crusty things out of it.  Let it drip a while.  Clean up the thin 
metal shims real well.  I glue them back on with aviation sealant, same goop 
I use for engines.

I heard mixing  grease and gear oil is good goo, and you can squirt it in 
with a plastic squeeze tube.  Like a ketchup container, with the pointy top.  
I'd filled mine with straight 90 wt, and still have a drip years later, so 
next time it's the mix.

 &gt; well since i am doing this work on the front end...maybe i should change 
the
 &gt; steering box lube/fluid/oil what ever you call it.
 &gt;
 &gt; i can see where the filler hole is(very small) but how do you drain it? do
 &gt; you need to remove the bottom plate? will this screw with the adjustment of
 &gt; the steering?
 
 Kevin,
 
 One doesn't traditionally drain the  steering box. Just refill it to the
 hole.
