Ok so now i'm stumped.  Last thing I checked was the tranny ground strap and 
it looked dead.  I ran a heavy gauge wire from the top starter bolt(engine 
bolt) and down to the chassis (clean spot).  The light was on with the first 
strap there, no strap and now with the makeshift testing strap.  Checked 
everything now.  What are the chances of the regulator in the Alternator gone 
bad?  What are the tell tale signs of this?  Any more suggestions?

Again this is a US spec 67 model ch # 237 057 463 so thats 11/4/66 prod. date
Bosch Internal regulated alternator (NEW)

    checked fuses
    checked ALL connections
    fixed broken terminal on ignition
    cleaned all connections in the entire bus with a wire brush
    fixed fuse box
    rewired a couple questionable wires to the headlight switch and ignition
    checked battery
    put charger on battery to test
    checked Voltage at all the connections
    checked taillights, headlights, t-signals
    resoldered some wires in the t-signal switch
    checked all relays
    checked for bad grounds and rub throughs
