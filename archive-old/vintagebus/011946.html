I can't recall offhand the battery compartment dimensions for a splitty,
but if it'll fit get a Group 24 size battery.

Sears usually tries to sell bus and bug owners a so-called &quot;Volkswagen
battery&quot;, partly because they don't know any better and partly because
it's usually a more expensive part.

As I've written here in the past, a &quot;Volkswagen battery&quot; is barely
adequate in a bus under good conditions.  A Group 24 battery, which was
the standard &quot;American car&quot; battery for many years, will transform your
bus's starting performance and capabilities.  

If it'll fit, get a top of the line &quot;Diehard Gold&quot; Group 24 battery
(they're on sale right now) and smile every time you start your bus or
turn on the headlights.
