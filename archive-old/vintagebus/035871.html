&lt;&lt; Stephen,
 
 I saw Dawn at OCTO, camped with her Saturday night, caravaned with her to 
the 
 Classic, and consider her a good friend.  I know things have been tough for 
 her, and as soon as I saw her, I asked if she was caught up yet.  She told 
me 
 that things were going well and indicated that she had a check &quot;in her 
 pocket&quot; for you.
 
 I think this is the exception to the rule &quot;the squeaky wheel gets the 
grease&quot;.

ya, well, I didn't say squat to her for months, but neither did I get what I 
was supposed to, so I gets the quiet wheel doesn't get the grease either.  
Actually was told she considered I made the deal with the bus, and since she 
didn't have it anymore I shouldn't bother her.  Seemed a bit odd.  

However, as it had completely slipped my mind that I had had that discussion 
with her (at the time) camper, and I apologise profusely and publicly for any 
misunderstanding that I had that she was involved, and not merely channelling 
the voice of a bus.

Clara

ps, I really had the firm impression that she agreed last July to get me a 
so42 westy door spice rack, in exchange for what she was given, but evidently 
it was the bus talking.   Those ventriloquist buses are real tricky.  Geez 
don't I feel dumb.
