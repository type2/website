You know, this count thing just reveals the lists dirty little secret.

There is a mental disease, I believe unnamed (hint hint), where as two half
broken or half rusted VW's is considered better than one good quality well
restored VW :)

I learned this from the list, I'm trying hard to break from it, but it ain't
easy :)
