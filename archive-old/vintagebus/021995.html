I had a bad/good experience with Maaco, they re- painted my 70 deluxe three 
times to make it right. the first two sprays were thin and orange peeled in 
spots, the third time they did a pretty damn good job, I was happy and paid 
the 485.00 bucks. All I did was to take the store manager out to inspect the 
bus and he agreed to re-do it till I was happy. I'd use em again, If your not 
happy don't pay until it's right.
I used Maaco on 2nd street in Albuquerque.

&lt;&lt; I went down and got a &quot;MAACO&quot; job and was verry mad! I spent 3 weeks 
sanding 
 and preping the body, when they finished the first thing I knoticed was the 
 engine was covered with over spray, they tried to fixed that but the block 
 held on the the paint. About a week later the paint on the nose started to 
 fall off, I took it back to them and they said, &quot;Well you should of said you 
 were in a V.W. club and we would of not even touched it. We do not do  show 
 paint and you get what you paid for&quot;. So I was stuck with runs in the paint 
 small lines that showed metal, and later started to rust, but the worsed 
 thing about it was they told me later if I would of gave them another 150.00 
 they would of done it right! I spent 450.00 on crap that the new owner is 
 going to have to sand off.
 
 If you pay the extra $ Maaco would be ok, the paint that they use is good 
 paint they just can't seen to put it on right unless you pay extra, but if I 
 were you I would got to a real shop if you plan on having the paint stay on! 
 
 Just my opinon. Mabey somone else out there has somthing good to say?
