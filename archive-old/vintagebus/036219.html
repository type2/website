&lt;&lt;Hi adam,

Judging by the pictures you have a kombi that someone added standard
interior panels to.

big clues are:
wood headliner with tracks over the driver and passenger seats (standards
dont have the tracks and its very unusual for someone to have added them.)

all black dash plastic:
standards have ivory, commercials have black.  Kombis are commercials.

nice bus though.  Personally, i really like those taillights, but im a
bit sick ;0

peas,

Steve
