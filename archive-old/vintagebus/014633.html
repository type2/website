&lt;&lt; Thanks for the response. Nuther question for you though - do you know of a
 one piece type part that would perform the same function on a pre 64
 suspension?&gt;&gt;
Hi Michael,
Not that we know of.  The 1955-63ish bus front axles are bigger diameter than 
any other air cooled VW we know of.  
 
&lt;&lt;Also - is the presence of the bigger front drums proof that a beam is a 
post 64. &gt;&gt;
Well we are not sure about the 1 ton 1963 model year only suspension, but 
think it uses the same drums only on the front as 1964-67 buses.  Best way to 
tell if you have a 1964-67 front suspension is to take off the hubcap and 
take a look at the hub cover that keeps out dust and keeps in the grease.  
Standard pre-1964 bus suspension has a hub cover that seats inside the drum 
itself.  The 1964-67 has a cover that seats over the outside of the drum and 
has a turned out ridge like a derby hat.  This allows the use of a claw 
hammer to remove the cover in no time due to this ridge.  Eric&amp;Barb
