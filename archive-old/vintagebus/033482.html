Yeh, and some people don't. But we don't hear from the &quot;non-stock&quot; people 
enough on this list. Seems like if you mention something that's &quot;non-stock&quot; 
a negative vibe is sent your way. So I'm gonna try to be a little more 
vocal about &quot;non-stock&quot; stuff in an effort to creative a more comfortable 
environment for discussion. Variety is the spice of life.
