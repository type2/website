Hi all
This is for Volks that can get to an &quot;Island Beach Co.&quot;  Store
I was shopping and spotted a real cool Splittie bus carrying a canoe on the
roof!
I liked it so much I bought one!  And for $5 bucks tooo!!
Too bad for me, all they had was small , but my Daughter is very delighted!!

tell em your looking for SKU 6885710   which is a IBC - IBVWB-T1A-
and if you find a Large let me know!
Thanks,,, good luck
