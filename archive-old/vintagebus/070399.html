Subject: Re: [VB] cooling test report

hm,, why up then down...
at low rpms the fan is sucking less air out of teh engine compartemnt.

as you speed up, more air is blown in by the vast speed of the bus, 

but eventually, the fan ends up sucking more out.  ... i guess.

cause basically I want to figure out not only whetehr some things (scoop, 
tin, etc) make the bus run cooler or not, but also relate it to air flow/air 
temps/fluid dynamics.  

oh, the idea of measuring pressure in the vents and out the fan just didn't 
work.  I can't seem to make it separate.

 &gt;engine compartment pressure was not linear with how fast I went in 4th 
gear. 
 &gt;  It generally was a bit lower than ambient (about 760 mmHg compared to 
764mm
 &gt;Hg), but was higher at 60 and 65 than at 55 or 70.
 &gt;
 &gt;probably no big surprises
 
 
 
   i dunno - WHY why does it go up, then down?
