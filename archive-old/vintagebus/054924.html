Subject: Fuel Pump won't pump fuel.

Yesterday my '66 quit about a block from home. I towed it home and found
that there was no fuel coming into the pump. I took out the cloth line and
replaced it, I ran a wire through the steel line and got some sediment from
the line that was probably causing the blockage. I took my air compressor
hose and blew through the fuel line to ensure that it is clear, fuel runs
freely into the pump. I also removed the fuel pump, cleaned and reassembled
it, there was no visible problem with the screens, membranes or springs. I
reinstalled the pump, replaced the cloth fuel line and fuel filter to the
carburetor. Clamped everything down and turned the engine...no fuel from the
pump. I took off the pump and as a test, I replaced it with a pump from a
recently running engine, same style pump, the one with four screws at the
top and the conical shaped screen behind the brass nut on the side.
With the second pump there is still no fuel coming out. I took off the pump
and checked the connecting rod, it rises and falls as the engine turns.
I'm stumped, any one got a suggestion???
Thanks in advance
John Flowers
