Subject: Re: Speaker Q

&gt;They actual ran the speaker wire through flexible metal conduit from the
&gt;body to the door. It looked like crap and sounded even worse when you
&gt;open the door. Any recommendations on what to use in place of the pretty
&gt;conduit?

New cars have a custom-molded rubber elbow for this.  There are grooves
at each end so it can seal into the door/body metal.  You might be able
to make a reasonable approximation of this with a piece of vacuum hose.
American style, one single layer of rubber - not the VW kind with the
braided cover.  Fuel or &quot;fuel/emissions&quot; hose with the braided layer
will also probably be too stiff.  Cut it long enough to still stick
into the door and the body a half-inch or so with the door all the way
open, and put zip ties around the ends (inside the door, inside the
body) to keep it in place.

It sounds like with the set-up you have now, the metal conduit slides in
and out of the door.  One possible problem with the vacuum hose set-up
is that it may not slide into the door, but fold up in the space between
the door and the body instead.  This might make the door hard to close.

That black corrugated split conduit is also probably too inflexible and
would be noisy when you opened the door.

I hope this helps!
