Has anyone else started having problems finding 6V bulbs?  The local VW FLAPS doesn't carry them and the only place I could find them was the place in town that has lots of NOS and vintage stuff.  Then it cost us over $30 for all the needed bulbs, and we didn't even get headlight bulbs.  Over a buck a bulb on average.  Anyone else finding that more stuff than ever is becoming 'obsolete'?

Hi all,

I have been running my 6v wipers on 12V for about 20 years. No Problem!. Now
they are fast enough to keep up with a real rain storm. The motor doesn't
even get hot. Soooo, don't worry, run your 6v motors on 12V! As for the
radio, it may burn out on the extra volts. The gas gage just pegs. What else
is there? All the light bulbs are replaceable with 12V units.
