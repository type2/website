&gt;  the trip is wide open.  Was 
&gt;  planning on taking my '66 Sundial w/ stock tranny and reduction boxes, 
1600 
&gt;  cc.  Some of the mods I will be doing prior to this trip are installing a 
&gt;  set of Kadron's going to a dual circuit brake sys. and gettting new tires 
&gt;  and brakes and I would really really really like to install a larger fuel 
&gt;  tank.  I also need to aquire a tire tool or star that fits my bus I won't 
&gt;  have the air tools on the road.  Well am I crazty?

no, taking a tire tool makes lots of sense.   I keep a craftsman flex handle 
(1/2 drive) with short extension and 3/4&quot; (19mm) impact socket behind the 
driver's seat for my tire tool.


 I mean should I just 
&gt;  leave the bus at home and drive the Mercury?

if you have been driving this bus and feel you have worked the kinks out, the 
bus is a far superior road trip/ camping vehicle.  

  It's just me a my little dog a 
&gt; 
&gt;  Jack Russel Terrier. 

doggies like road trips in buses  :)
