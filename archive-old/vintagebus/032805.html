&lt;&lt;Eric,
Just went out and got a new tube.  There were three different lengths they 
had,
I got the shortest one they had which was the same length as my old one.  The
ends were plastic which is how they all are now :-|

 I'll check the metal tube for damage.  Is it imperative I have a flex tube 
for the accl. cable.  I was told they are NLA.  Can I use gas line or some 
other substitute??   Thanks for the help.  &gt;&gt;
Hi Steve,
You can use German fuel line hose clamped onto the end of the accelerator 
cable body tube.  Mainly it helps protect both the cable from rubbing on the 
tranny and keeps it from cutting into the tranny case.   Eric&amp;Barb
