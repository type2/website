Subject: Order received from Kustom 1 Warehouse

Just one thing to add:  The speed of the order fulfillment.  The order was
invoiced on 1/16/01, but not shipped until 1/18/01, according to the UPS
tracking website.  Arrival was 1/24/01.



I just received an ouder from Kustom 1 (a major HVWs advertiser), and the
results were mixed.

Items ordered:

Type 1 Bosch alternator                 $90.00

Type 1 body to pan seal                 $9.95

Type 1 full flow oil pump / filter      $26.95

36mm Axle nut wacker tool               $5.95

Type 1 oil pump puller tool             $4.00

Type 1 crank pulley puller              $25.00

Type 1 lower front axel supports        $25.00

As per their advertised offer, I was supposed to receive a 10% discount on
shipping for an order of more than $100


Actual order received:

Bosch alternator:    OK.  Made in Brazil, new in U.S. Bosch packaging

Pan seal:   Maybe OK.  Looks like garage door bottom seal to me.  One roll
of the stuff.  Won't know if it's long enough until I'm into the job.  I
must measure and cut each of the four pieces needed, and I must also punch
out the bolt holes myself.  A pain in the ass.

Oil pump:  Made in Taiwan.  Looks OK I guess.

Axle nut tool.  Sent a 36mm socket (cheap Taiwan brand) by mistake, though
the invoice reads &quot;AXLE NUT TOOL&quot;.

Oil pump puller:  Looks OK for a $4 item.

Pulley puller:  Missing.  Invoice says &quot;B/O&quot;

Front axle supports:  Made in Taiwan.  Unpainted welded raw metal.  Missing
the clamps, nuts, and bolts for attachment to the axle.

Shipping charge:  Invoice says &quot;Actual ship 28.40&quot;, and I was charged
$25.56.  According to the UPS website
(http://www.ups_dot_com/using/services/rave/qcost.cgi), the actual charge for a
package of this size and weight (26 lb weight printed on the UPS shipping
label on the box), picked up at the shipper's location, and sent to my zip
code, residential delivery, is $16.53.



I am today ordering the axle supports ($18), wacker tool ($6), and pulley
puller ($13) from Latest Rage (another HVWs advertiser I've had good
results with).  I am going to call Kustom 1 today and cancel the
backordered pulley puller, and return the 36mm socket and axle supports by
parcel post.  I will ask for a refund on the returned parts, the cancelled
backorder, the shipping overcharge, and the shipping on the wrong and
incomplete parts.

Anyone else dealt with Kustom 1 Warehouse?
