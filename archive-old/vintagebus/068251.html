Subject: Re: [VB] Tires, it had to be tires!

&gt; Any Firestone dealer can get RD-603 Bridgestone tires.  They are stock
&gt; replacements on 1-ton toyota pickups, so they aren't all that hard to
&gt; find in the proper 185R14 size.  Firestone is owned by Bridgestone, but
&gt; Bridgestone doesn't use Firestone factories to make their tires.

When I went to 2 firestone dealers about 603v.
First dealer, had to call me and never got back to me.
second quoted me around 100.00 per tire (Just the tire cost)
and had to order them.
This was a couple years ago when the 603v was like 60.00 at tirerack which
is like 65.00 each shipped. I explained this to the guy and he said &quot;thats
our price&quot;. Ive got yoko 356s and am happy with them.
they have like 20,000 on them now and the little bit of odd wear
on front left is my lazy assed fault. They are holding up very well.
