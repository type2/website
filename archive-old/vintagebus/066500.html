Subject: re:snake oil or real product

I thought they already produced something like this to attach to the
insideof the sump plate. I installed one of these, it was donut shaped, came
with a spring to hold it in place. i never noticed anything on it when
taking the plate off. i am not sure what happened to it when i got my new
engine. if i find it i will put it in my bus, and see it it collects
anything.

actually now that i think of it, i remember a VW mechanic i talked to once,
told me that the wear components in the engine are not attracted to magnets,
so the magenet will not help much.
