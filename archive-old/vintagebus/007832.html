Subject: Where to get them bus wipers?
Date: Thu, 23 Mar 2000 19:41:51 -0600
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

I know I've read several queries over the past month or 2 about where to get
them SWF type looking wipers.  I was told that you can reference an old Jeep
wiper and it's basically the same thing but heck, I can't even find it in
the JCW catalog.  Am I stuck paying $17 for just one through RMMW?  The
local autozone has plastic adaptors for the Bosch looking wipers but I want
that stock vintage wiper look.  Thanks for the help once again...
