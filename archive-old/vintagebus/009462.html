Personally I think things were perfect the way they were with the on-line searchable archives.  You search for what you want, clip it into a MS Word document, print it and sit in front of your bus and try to apply others helpful knowledge.  No problem and no need for a CD.

Stephen, I hope you stay part of the list and bus community here and I do not think anyone will shun you for your ideas.  Do not become a &quot;ghost&quot; user.

A number of people have mentioned that the CD-ROM being an advance in the way our list is run...?  I do not agree with this.  As soon as a CD is burned it is old information.  The only way to have the most up to date information is to have real time database access, like we currently have/had.  The future will bring us closer to a thin desktop with minimal hardware and software, but accessing information and software through a very high speed internet service.  So really anything that is not on a real time server is old technology.
