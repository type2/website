Subject: blowing hot air

All,
A friend of mine brought me his engine out of his 65 crew cab yesterday in
the back of his Ford. He said it was running hot all the time and his oil
seemed to have a burnt smell to it. We chucked it up on the start up stand
and did a compression test which looked good. After changing the oil and
adjusting the valves I then fired it up and it sounded pretty good. The
engine only had about 20K on it and the timing was good and it was still
fairly clean. As I bent around it checking for exhaust leaks and other
possibly problems I got blown in the face with warm air. It was then that I
noticed that he had a pair of those cheap ill fitting plastic fresh air
hoses from his shroud to the heat exchangers. They were so loose that air
was blowing right past them. As I let the engine run I noticed the oil temp
climbing. I pulled the hoses and put two block offs in the shroud and the
fired up the engine again. After five minutes the oil temp started back down
into a safe area I could live with. I told him he was losing so much air
around his hoses that he was robbing air going through his oil cooler. I
then put on a couple of aluminum tubes , fired it up thinking that was that,
and then found that the heat exchanger stove pipes were leaking badly. The
flapper valve gaskets were shot. He went to order a couple of heat
exchangers and I figure that will take care of most of his warm weather over
heating. We'll find out next week.
