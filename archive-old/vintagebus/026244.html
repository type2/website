Subject: [VB] Barn find and Barndoor question.
Message-ID: &lt;3831A011.2F20B923_at_vintagewarehouse_dot_com&gt;

I guess this last weekend was one for finding the good deals.
To make a long story short I was contacted Friday by a guy that
had the typical &quot;really old Buses&quot;. After some back and forth
questioning I get out of him ones a Panel the other a Single
&quot;early 50's&quot; he thinks.  At least they both have split
windshields he knows that for sure, so this shouldn't be a waste.
Anyway I call him Saturday night before I leave for Vallejo to
see if he found the titles and any info on the years. 1 title for
the single says '54 nothing for the Panel but it looks the same.
I was tempted to pass on the show and head straight there but he
assures me he hasn't called anyone else about them. Just me, got
my number from his cousin I know through some construction work I
did for him, using my Crew as a work truck. It pays to drive your
Bus daily. Anyway I go to the show, it wasn't huge but there were
VW's and VW friends so that makes it worthwhile. Made some $$
selling then packed up and left, early............I had other
thing to attend to.

Hey Rex, now you know why I wasn't to talkative and wanted to get
out of there...............

Anyway I get to the house/barn/trailer/fruit orchard via some
weird direction and sure enough 1 '54 Single Cab and a Barndoor
Panel too boot. The truck was supposed to run, it didn't. The
Panel needs about the same amount of work as my '56 Panel so I
may do it instead and leave the '56 as is for now. I'm sure I
don't need them both so one will give up parts to make the other
100% complete/correct and then most likely be sold.

My question is about the year of the Panel I haven't got a chance
to clean it out and get to the ID numbers to check the year. But
I'm thinking it's earlier than '54 as it has no bumper in back
and looks as if it may have had body bumpers at some point. Did
Panels come with these or am I wishing?

I know I'll have more questions when I really get into them but
I'd like to have an idea of the year at least for now.

Thanks,
Greg
