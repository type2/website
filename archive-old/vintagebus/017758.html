Hi Kevin,
How about using a 6 to 12 volt inverter?? That way you can use 12 volt 
gauges on a six volt VW without any problems. By the way oil pressure is a
better gauge to start out with. Eric&amp;Barb

ok....what gauges do most of you run on your buses? why would an oil pressure
gauge be better to start out with? As for using an inverter, i thought there
may be potential probelems getting a somewhat accurate reading using an
inverter, and would be better off getting one that is specifically designed
for 6v.

I just did a search on the web for oil temp gauges, and found a bunch of
companies selling them. I have sent email to all re:obtaining a 6v version of
their gauges.
I actually found one site www.sherco-auto_dot_com that has a 3 gauge set that is
&quot;engineered for 6 or 12 volt system&quot;. Is this possible? Has anyone ever done
business with this company, or know the reliability of their products?  What
is the range that i should eb looking for with any gauges ie:
oil temp -180 deg  to 300 deg?

thanks for any additional info re:gauges.
