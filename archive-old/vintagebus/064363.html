Subject: Re: [VB] Any Experience with Tom Buese &amp; his canvas?

&gt; Tom donated a SC canvas to this past year's raffle bus for Jerome
Jamboree...
I saw the truck just last weekend at a local Phoenix area show.  The new
owner has acquired a set of hoops and has installed the canvas.  It looks
great.  The fit seemed perfect: a bit loose so that when it gets some
weather (it could happen in Phoenix) it should shrink just right.
&gt;
Here's a pic from the show:
