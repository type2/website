Subject: Re: [VB] 21-window up in smoke

Let me add just a little bit to this.  Everybody also go check the brass
fitting on the carb and both of the ones on the fuel pump.  If they're
loose, fix them!  One way, at least at the carb, is to put a piece of wire
around the clamp on the fuel hose and run it around to one of the screws
that holds the top of the carb on.  If the clamp can't move off the brass
fitting, there's a better chance that the fuel line won't move either.  This
caused a fire in my first bus, a lotus white/lotus white '66 13-window.
Lost about $3k on that one about 4 years ago.  Do it today, don't put it
off!

&gt; Check your fuel lines today! If they're more than a year old
&gt; replace them.
&gt;
&gt; Make sure the brass tube where the fuel line joins your carb
&gt; is tight. Make sure you have a grommet where the metal fuel
&gt; line goes through the front (FIF) left engine tin.
