 WE HAVE THE DOGLEGS FOR $200.00 A SIDE REAR CORNERS FOR $200.00 A SIDE AND A
 THE WHOLE FRONT NOSE CLIP FOR $500.00.  TAKE IN MIND THAT WE HAVE TO CUT THE
 BUS APART.  A LOT OF LABOR.
 
 So that's
 
 (200 x 2) + (200 x 2) + 500 = 1300 for some parts?  I betcha Kelly could
 fabricate the pieces for less than that.  Granted it's not og, but that's an
 awful lot for what?  Barndoor parts?  Are we gonna seen the '54 RHD Deluxe
 driving around the streets of Sacramento in about a week?

I doubt it, very few buses drive around here in Sacramento.
