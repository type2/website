i have a tent , has a rubber floor, it is orange like poptop material, with
a red and blue striped door, it has external poles, its in great shape, i
got it for $50 from someone i met at the flea market, and well i think they
had a 71 westy, it was 7 years ago and its foggy, i remeber thinking damn
thats as much as i paid for the whole bus, but i bought it,      anyway ,
does anyone know what year that would be from?
what its worth?
does someone have a web page on these tents?

just curious , i havent tried it on my 66 but i guess i will now,  if
someone offered me $1700 , i would sell it in a heart beat, i can also say
that the bags for these things and the poles do tend to get more used
looking than the rest of the tent , if you a carrying it around,

&gt; AFAIK the first Westy tent with a floor was the &quot;Add-a-Room&quot; or
&gt; &quot;Drive-Away&quot; tent offered for the '68 models.  That tent was also the
&gt; first Westy tent (since at least mid-50's) with an external frame.  In
&gt; fact the two features are probably related.
