I discussed this with Rob tonight on the phone but I'm going to post this
here in case anyone else can shed some input on the subject.

Back when Rob and I were down at Dan Kinsey's house when he lived in KCMO,
he took us to see a guy (Howard Kilgore was it???) that had a 54 Barndoor
project and a funky 21 window white over light green with Westy windows in
each window hole along the side for a total of 8.  It had a non-westy
interior but definitely some kind of light colored masonite camping type
fixtures installed.  He bought it from a couple of exchange students eons
ago.

I noticed the squirters that shoot fluid on the windows were make of a
little flat chrome or stainless steel disc with a tiny brass fitting on the
side which could be adjusted with a wrench to aim the fluid properly.  The
only squirters I ever know of were the elcheapo plastic ones you aim with
pin.

My grandfather drug his 1949 Chevy Carryall (HANG ON - this all fits
together - gimme a minute) into town last week and I helped him this morning
to get the engine unstuck so he can get it started.  This hulk of a machine
is rusted in so many places but like all good car buffs, he hung on to ALL
the interior seats (equivalent to a bus middle seat), after sitting for 32
years, all the electricals still work.  He actually got it to turn over with
the 6 volt starter this afternoon.  This bohemoth even has the equivalent of
LEVER shocks - cool!  But admisdt all the awesome antiquity of it all, what
do you think I spied in the washer fluid holes on this machine?  The exact
same stainless steel/chrome discs with brass fittings that I saw on that 21
Window Bus in KCMO.  Either these are old Chevy squirters or old aftermarket
that was built to last.

I like them better than those plastic doodads.
