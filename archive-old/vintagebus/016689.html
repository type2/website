What's more important is the *range* of operating temperatures.  If it's 115
in the day, and 40 at night, then something like 20/50 might be better.

I've never heard the authoritive word on mixing weights, like 1/2 20/50 and
1/2 straight 50, or such concoctions.  Some have said &quot;yeah, it's great&quot;
and some have said &quot;eeeeviiil&quot;

When I had my '72 911, which was a warm running beast since it didn't 
have the secondary cooler, I ran 60wt in the summer, like june/july/august
and early september.  As soon as the weather started to turn, you could tell - 
cranking that engine was like strring honey!

&gt; I know that there has been a bit of discussion on the weight of oil for hot

&gt; about to make a 1000mi r/t in his 66 van in 100+ temps.
&gt; 
&gt; Here in town (Vegas ) where it gets over 115 often, I run a straight 40 in
&gt; summer and, plan my trips so I only run 15-20 min at a time and then stop
&gt; for up to an hour but, going to be going to Salt Lake City end of the month
&gt; and, it's all I-15 all the way, so, any suggestions?
