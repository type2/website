&gt; Hi Bryan,
&gt; Remove one of the disc brake pads and take it down the your FLAPS and have 
&gt; them match it to what they have in supply.  From what we understand 1973 and 
&gt; later discs are a bit bigger than the 1971-72 disc brakes.   Eric&amp;Barb
er, not quite.

the 71-72 disk brake pads are _thinner_ than the 73-79 parts.  All other
dimensions are identical.  They chnaged the design because the pads wore
out too quick, but otherwise kept the same design.

If you want to buy pads and be sure they fit opt for the 71-72 pads, they
will fit 71-79.

the 73-79 pads will fit 73-79 only when new, but if they are worn down
there is no way to tell which model it came from. (they are too thick to
fit into the 71-72 calipers)

peas,

Steve
