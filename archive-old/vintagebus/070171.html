Subject: RE: [VB] more engine tin &amp; now alternator question

  There are numerous under pully tins. I have 4 different ones that I can
think of off hand and whenever putting an engine together I always match the
pully tin to the breast plate. 
  I personally use the early 1500 tin with the narrow pully tin (like you
appear to have) and a breast plate to match. 
  I have piles of the wider breast plates like you also appear to have and
the corresponding tin.
  One of these days when I have time (ya right) I can post pics of all the
different styles and let the VW gurus out there date them all.

ps. In other words you either need a different year breast plate or a
different year (easier to find) pully tin

Subject: [VB] more engine tin &amp; now alternator question


I got around to taking a few pics for my questions. 1 question was
exactly what tin I had, since it didn't seem to fit properly. pics of
there are here:

http://fasterlaster_dot_com/albums/bus/66westy/DCP_3115-8-0.shtml
http://fasterlaster_dot_com/albums/bus/66westy/DCP_3116-8-0.shtml

there is a major gap on the drivers side that leads me to believe I
don't quite have everything I need.

So while putting all the accessories on tonite I got the alternator
mounted then noticed that there was a problem. The carb accelerator
pump linkage is hitting the alternator body causing it not to open
fully. pics of the close proximity are here:

http://fasterlaster_dot_com/albums/bus/66westy/DCP_3113-8-0.shtml

I'm not sure why it is hitting, but I'm gonna have to do something
about that, just wondering if anyone else that has installed an
alternator has seen something similar.

Last but not least the reason I had to get a new long block.

These pieces were once part of the case:

This is the case

http://fasterlaster_dot_com/albums/bus/66westy/DCP_3119-8-0.shtml

pretty nasty. it really should have all those pieces in it :)

thanks for any insights into these issues.
