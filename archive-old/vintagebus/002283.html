  Hi fellow Bus-Volks.  I posted a few weeks ago about being invited to the OCTO
 show in a friends barndoor.  Well he calls two hours before departure time to say
 he's not going! #_at_%&amp;it, now what? It's 6:00 PM Friday BTW. I took three days 
 off from work to be able to go, ( I work every other week-end), promised a 'vert 
 deck lid to someone and t-shirts to a bunch of listees.  My wife says &quot;Pack the 
 Rang*r and let's go..&quot;  We arrived in Anahiem at 1:15 AM., got a room, (snuck
 in Max the dog,(Boxer). We only could stay for two hours, remember my wife's
 dinner engagement Sat. evening. 
  Bus content, this OCTO was my first!  I didn't think there was this many buses
 around!  Next year I'll be in my '61 Westy.
 PS. Sorry to those listees who I missed getting a t-shirt to!
  Lou in Havasu
