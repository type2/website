I know some of the DKB guys in florida are driving out.
Kris H. and Mark rafferty for sure.
Driving a 54 deluxe and a 59? singlecab.
Probably a few others as well.
I think Deasterwoods coming from around there as well. Probably driving his 
54? kombi.

&lt;&lt;THere are talks of MAYBE for June 2001, a caravan leaving out of FL/GA
and heading to the classic. Thats a long ways off, but it will take a
lot of planning and a couple of weeks to pull it off.
