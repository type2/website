that they were well made.

&gt; List:
&gt; 
&gt; I'm not sure what exactly they're called, but they
&gt; are the aluminum curved uprights of the basket on
&gt; wood slat Westy roofracks.  I need to replace 2-3 of
&gt; them on a sloped roofrack, and I was wondering if
&gt; anyone had some spares lying around?  I've
&gt; considered going the repop PIP route, but I haven't
&gt; heard many good things about PIP racks or their
&gt; components.
&gt; 
&gt; Cash or parts to trade.  Thanks in advance.
