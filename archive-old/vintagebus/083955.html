&gt; Hi All -
&gt;
&gt; 	good advice from Lou:
&gt; &quot;...doubt the theory of  'double life' but having a modern spin on
&gt; filter as  compared to the OG screen has to be a plus. ... It also
&gt; provides a venue for an external oil cooler if the type of VW you are
&gt;   driving or the type of driving you do warrants it.
&gt;
&gt; It is vitally important to use quality components when doing the
&gt; installation, use high pressure steel braided hoses with the correct
&gt; fittings, not rubber hoses and hose clamps.. ..&quot;

Problem with this is that ever since braided hose became &quot;kewl&quot; we have
been flooded with braided hose that is basically junk.  I prefer a good
rubber hose made by a reputable manufacturer like Gates.

Hose clamps are not always bad either, as long as they are good quality
and the fittings have beaded ends.
