&lt;&lt;  so if the bearings &amp; seals haven't been available since the 60s, then 
it'll be really hard to get it back together I imagine.  The seals... no 
biggie, IMHO... the last time I went to the bearing place in Nashville, I had 
to wait a good while because the guy in front of me was being spoon-fed 
different options on seals.
Hi Jason,
Hopefully so.  We know of a shop out here that used to rebuild autostick type 
1 trannies.  Had to stop due to not being able to find just a few parts 
including one main seal.  They tried and tried to find this seal through the 
bearing houses.

&lt;&lt;Surely something has been produced that will work... I have faith in that.  
Baum Tools sells a jig for pinning (actually repinning) main bearing saddles 
where the dowel pin holes have worn excessively. The kit comes with dowel 
pins that are OS on half of their length... other half goes into the back 
side of the bearing as usual. So surely we could pin the bearings..&gt;&gt;
You can even use a normal bearing drilled through as a temperary jig.

&lt;&lt;But some new bearings would have to be made up or turned down from 
something.  How odd to have the thrust bearing anywhere but up front in the 
case...  How would one set crank end play in such a motor? or is that 
possible? IIRC a dead DD series 60 we inspected had a main thrust bearing 
buried somewhere in the engine. &gt;&gt;
The thrust bearing is #2 in them.  We have heard of some japes of Gene Berg.  
One of them was entering in races often bending the rules a bit.  One race 
that was resticted to pre-1960 engines.  To get around using the 36HP engine 
Berg remachined a bastard 40HP engine to take a 1500/1600cc 69mm throw crank 
and big bore 40HP P&amp;Cs.  So definitely the rebuilding of the bastard 40HP 
engine is not impossible but maybe just a bit hard.  Using the stock 40HP 
64mm or even 1500/1600 69mm crank would remove the bastard 40HP crank that 
seems to break about every 30,000 miles.  Which is the main reason we have 
heard that this motor was disscountinued.
  By the way does anyone have an extra head?  We would like to have one for a 
spare.  We have a few set of NOS 40HP P&amp;C for possible sale/trade.
