&quot;All I want is whats fair...The proper title I was
TOLD the van had and also 
the nice rear corners off of a '67 bus that were
said to be in great shape.&quot;

why did you pay for the bus if you were expecting
title and didn't receive the title? who wants to play
the role of judge mills lane? not it.
