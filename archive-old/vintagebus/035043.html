&lt;&lt; Ok, what's the magic technique to separate the shift rod that's just aft
 of the  front axle? I drilled out the previously-broken bolt, used a
 little penetrant, a little heat and a few choice words, but the rods
 won't separate. &gt;&gt;
Hi Everret,
Try heating the coupler till red hot and then spraying a hose of water on it 
immeadiately.  Repeat a couple of times and try twisting it again.  Be 
carefull not to wrench on parts of the shift rod that is hollow except in the 
very ends which are filled with a solid steel plugs.  If that does not work 
you might have to cut the solid front coupler with a oxy/axcelerene torch.  
Right across the center then when both rods are out you can remove the 
remains of the coupler.  If you chose to cut the forward shift rod instead 
make sure to mark it parallel to the rod.  Then when welding back together 
use the same blade to gap the rod pieces properly, align the ends with the 
marks, and use hose clamps and pieces of wood to split it together.  Then 
weld here and there till solid and remove the wood pieces and clamps, and 
finish the welding.
