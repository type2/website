&gt; I send this post for two reasons, What do shorten buses go for, is this
&gt; any kind of deal and is there anyone out there wanting me to get more

&gt; but I can.

Like any custom car, it totally depends on how likely someone
else is to appreciate the customization, and how much they'd pay for it.
That's it.  You can sink $50k into a super duper chopped, channeled, tubbed,
fire breathing hot rod, but that doesn't make it worth $50k.  Most
people have a hard time selling their custom creations, and the 
classifieds are full of &quot;invested $XX,XXX - must sell - $X,XXX&quot;

Personally, I wouldn't give him $100 for it.  Maybe $75.
