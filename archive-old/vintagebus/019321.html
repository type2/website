if you guys are looking for specific bolts or screws you can always try
mcmaster_dot_com...they have pretty much everything.

There is a place called bayou bolt here in houston, the grandaddy of bolt
stores...I think it is about two or three huge warehouses full of nuts bolts
screws and anything related to them.

if you are really stuck I could look there for them.

one odd bolt that I do know the size of I got there..the two mini bolts that
hold the turn signal switch to the contraption that holds it to the stering
column.  3mm.
