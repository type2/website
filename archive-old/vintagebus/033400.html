Okay, my tranny is in the shop getting a ring and pinion upgrade, etc. and I
wondered if it would be a good idea to get the bellhousing enlarged to allow a
12 volt flywheel.  I intend to install a 1776cc engine with dual kadrons.  It
currently has a lightened Scat flywheel attached but I have been told that
these are not great for daily drivers.  I want to run 12 volts in the bus so
should I use the 6 volt starter with 12 volt solenoid or just swap it up to a
straight 12 volt setup?  The van in question is an early 64.  Can anyone with
experience give me pros and cons or personal suggestions?  Will enlarging the
bellhousing weaken the case of my tranny?
Thanks in advance,
Dan Morris
