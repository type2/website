Long story made short....the bus is stuck 600 miles from home and I dont 
remember how the entire corners are. I just know it has those nasty trailer 
lights and I just picked up a decent pair of -61 tail lights. SO, I just 
want to be prepared for when I get it home. I know they can be fixed and 
even fabricated which is what is going to have to be done to the corners on 
my 71 singlecab.

&gt;&lt;&lt; If anyone has a good set of rear corner (butt cheeks to some) for a 61 
&gt;SC
&gt;for sale, drop me a line. Some did a BAD thing and cut the holes bigger for
&gt;those aftermarket round trailer tail lights.
&gt;
&gt;Thanks,

&gt;
&gt;And that requires replacing the ENTIRE corner!!!???????
