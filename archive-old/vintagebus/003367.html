Since I've just begun my conversion of an all original 65 Camper into a
rolling shell, anyone have their favorite order in which to dissassemble,
repair/replace, then reassemble?  I've already cleaned out ppo's personal
effects (slippers, shoe polish, taco bell hot sauce, electric bills, etc.),
removed most of the camper interior and floor.  My goal is to turn the bus
inside out, and do a respectable resto.  Here's where it's at:

Had been sitting 1 1/2 years?
Running, rough, loud
Can just barely find first and reverse
Driver's window rot along bottom seal (1/4&quot;holes)
Rockers shot
Driver's dogleg bad
Rear wheels toe in
absolutely no brakes
Super solid frame
Straight as an arrow
All electrical working

If I fixed the brakes, I could probably drive it around a bit.  I only
started it to get it off the trailer and into my garage.  I'm in no rush
whatsoever because it is my fifth car, and I was supposed to &quot;stop&quot; after
the fourth, so I'm glad just to have it at all.  I'm working on a website to
show pics of progress, and my goal is to eventually give the bus the same
feeling of pride it had when it went on it's first camping trip way back
when.  Possible thread starter:  pro's and con's of putting safari's and
deluxe trim on it eventually :)?
