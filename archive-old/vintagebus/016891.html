&gt; &gt; something. &quot;Make peace not war&quot; And that was said by people who used our
&gt; &gt; precious buses before you were around.
&gt;
&gt;Kirin (named after a Japanese beer?), I know you're young and your heart is
&gt;in the right place. but allow me to correct. It's &quot;Make love, not war&quot;. 
&gt;Your
&gt;paraphrasing is more appropriate in this instance.
