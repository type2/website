Subject: Re: &amp; my 65 Re: [VB] Another Lazy Mechanic

People do this to me ALL THE TIME. .. thing is, I look like an Old Hippie.
I AM AN OLD HIPPIE .. but haven't smoked a joint in two decades or more and
I have a 4 year accounting degree.  I wear round eye glasses, [more like
Ozzie Osborne] but people say John Lennon glasses.  Someone asked, &quot;did you
get those John Lennon glasses to go with your van?&quot;  I told them &quot;no .. got
the BUS to go with my glasses.&quot;  &quot;NOT VAN&quot; .. I always have a need to
correct them!!  I have been wearing round glasses for longer than I can
remember .. And another comment is &quot;anyone ever tell you that you look like
Janis Joplin ?&quot;  OH GOD!! I always say you mean the &quot;pig face or the
horrible acne?&quot;  [her classmates called her &quot;pig face&quot; and her skin was
pretty bad.]  I don't think she had a pig face, not me.  I look NOTHING like
her.  Except I have long hair and wear glasses.

Anyhow .. I don't really mind the hippie comments.  But I do get annoyed at
how little attention they pay to detail .. They are Not John Lennon
Glasses - and they are NOT Janis Joplin glasses .. and it is a bus .. not a
van .. and what sort of nut case would buy their glasses to match their &quot;VAN
.. &quot;

Peace, Diane

&gt; I can't be the only person annoyed by stupid middle aged clean cut wierdo
strangers with minivans who come up to me in parking lots saying &quot;WOWW,
Woodstock mannn!&quot;  making joint smoking gestures.  If that was my scene, I
wouldn't have it together to have a decent bus.   can't help or want to know
about what they did when they were young.  sc%%%w them and their inner
children .   Okay  .... rant mode off...
