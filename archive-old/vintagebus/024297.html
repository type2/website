Subject: insulation

I'd kinda like to get an idea as to how people feel about insulating a
bus before putting panels back in - is it worth while? - does it lead to
more rust? - if it is useful what kinda would be best? - and when i
removed my interior to do some welding the blanket like thing that sits
between the back seat and motor was beyond salvage - so i need to
replace it - any ideas as to what I should use?

Thanks
