Subject:  RE: [VB] Steering Wheel Removal and pullers
Date: Fri, 17 Mar 2000 14:42:06 +1030

When I was working in the States I bought a 'bearing separator/puller
and gear puller set' from JC Whipme.  Their no. is 81DH2372T (old
catalog though) for $39.99.

It looked a bit junky and when I first opened it I thought
'hmmmmmm.....'   BUT it turned out to be worth its weight
in gold!   I have configured this kit to pull
crank gears, wheel bearings, steering wheels, reduction box
bearings etc etc.  

Money well spent in the end!  8-)

&gt; I cobbled together a simple press out of angle iron,
&gt; threaded rods, misc nuts and bolts.  When the time 
&gt; came to remove the steering wheel in the '67 I reconfigured
&gt; the contraption into a puller.  I had to find properly
&gt; threaded bolts to fit into the threaded holes, and with
&gt; a center bolt pushing against the center threaded 
&gt; portion, it came right off.  I used regular bolts 90 degrees
&gt; to the puller bolts to hold the angle iron against the 
&gt; puller bolts.
