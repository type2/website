Subject: Re: [VB] match FW to crank 6volt Starter Life Span and Carb
  Problem

If you have a stepped crank, you must use a stepped crank flywheel.  You can 
use a early (stepped) FW on your later crank.   AT least that's the way I 
understand it, else suffer oil leaks.

If I were you, I would pull the motor and investigate the oil leak.  I think 
the later 40hp came with O rings, only the early 40hp (and the 36hp) cranks 
were stepped.  40hp and 1600 cranks are interchangable, so you could have 
either stepped or non stepped.   Check it out and replace your Main seal and 
oil cooler seals.  Make sure your clutch isn't soaked.

&lt;&lt; Are 6V and 12V flywheels interchangeable?  I have a persistant front oil
 seal leak and several people have said that they reckon it is due to the
 fact that I have a 6V flywheel on a 12V 1600 twin port crank.  They say that
 although they go together, they do not fit properly.  Anyone have any
 knowledge or experience of this - I have searched the net and have not found
 any reference for this.
 
 Thanks
