I'm not telling anyone not to go to any shows, but I do like to give the
pot a good stir.  I could just &quot;feel&quot; a panic &quot;gotta get this thing
together in time for the show&quot; vibe.   Around Sacramento, I see some of the
sorriest VW's running around, and we have a lot of VW FLAPSs in the area,
so it's not for inaccessibility to parts.

Maybe some day I'll drag myself down to AZ, but right now I can't afford to
take a week off work.  Time == money.  But by the time comes that I *can*
afford to take a week off, I'll probably be banned from any AZ show anyway
because you-know-who will have bought it.
