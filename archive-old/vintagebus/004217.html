Subject: Steering Wheel &amp; Clock Stuff: Turn Signal Switch
Date: Sat, 15 Apr 2000 11:08:22 -0700
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

Hello again...

I forgot to mention the new need I have for the white turn signal actuator
assembly when I posted yesterday about getting the Deluxe wheel for my
Kombi.  So, if anyone can tell me a good price, and also how hard are they
to fix if they're broken?

The clock thing:  I was cleaning up my clock....it has no plastic cover on
the back....and I was messing around with the mechanism....I finally
understand how it works!  My 280Z has a similar clock....every once in a
while it clicks....this is the electro-magnet activating, which throws a
lever to actuate a pawl, which winds the clock!  Elegant.

So...one question:   How does the clock clamp into the dash?  I know it has
to be removed to be set...if someone could explain it to me, I'd be
grateful...

Gene
