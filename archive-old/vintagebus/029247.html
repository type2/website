Subject: middle seat at buses?

Hello everyone,
I have a salt and pepper middle seat in pristine condition, and a rear
seat to go with it.  The middle is excellent and original... the plastic
end caps on the handles aren't even cracked!  The rear bottom could use
recovering...but the back is still good.
If anyone is interested ...I could probably pack them into my bus for
the trek down to MO...  trades only!  let me know what you've got if
you're interested....

Isaiah
