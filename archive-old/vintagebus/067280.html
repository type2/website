Subject: Re: [VB] horn repair

My guess it that you need to put it together and adjust it while
connected to a real car or truck battery, to get enough current to drive
the windings inside the horn and activate the 'points' properly. 
Doesn't have to be 'on' the bus, you can use jumpers to hook it up
directly to the battery while you futz with it.

Before you put it together, make sure the adjusting screw is actually
giving you some daylight between the points when you turn it, which you
will need to create the sound.  When I resurrected my OG horn last year
(with help from the Type 2 archives) I found that I first had to
(carefully) bend back that piece of metal to create some distance
between the points.  That piece had lost its springiness and the ability
of the screw to create a gap between the points had completely
disappeared over time.  Once I did that, the adjustment screw once again
did its job in creating the optimum sound volume.

&gt; i put it back together with a couple spring clamps as i don't have a bunch
&gt; of screws to put it together yet, and i wanted to test it. I then got a few
&gt; double A batteries together, until I got about 6.3V. The I hooked it up ot
&gt; the horn, and it is doing something...not sure exactly what, i am thinking i
&gt; just need to adjust the screw some. it makes a thunking noise, and it
&gt; appears as though the diaphragm just goes thunk against the coil.
&gt; 
&gt; I checked the archives with some help there from Matt and Eric &amp; Barb. I
&gt; guess the condenser gains then loses a charge, causing the contacts to open
&gt; and close. but in its rest state-the contacts should be closed, right?
&gt; 
&gt; some questions:
&gt; since i mangled the gasket-could i just use some liquid gasket stuff, like
&gt; permatex?
&gt; does it makes sense to just put it together, and adjust the screw with it on
&gt; the bus?
&gt; seems like if it is making that thunk noise-it either needs to just be
&gt; adjusted, or the double A batteries don't have enough juice to sutain a
&gt; &quot;BEEP&quot;. does that sound right?
