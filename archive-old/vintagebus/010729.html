Subject: PNW Vintage Meet Update !!!!!!!!!!!
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com, type2_at_type2_dot_com

Got back from the Cascade Kombis Club Meeting tonight and am very excited.  
For one thing, the T-shirt design is absolutely incredible.   It was actually 
done by none other than the inspired Peter Ashwandan, who illustrated the 
Idiot Book.   A bug and a splitty with the Seattle skyline behind them, the 
Space Needle to the right, and some bits of valve springs and valve and valve 
adjusting screws on the left.  

NOT ONLY THAT, but the ORIGINAL drawing is one of the raffle prizes!  
 And two signed framed posters.  wow. 

The trophies for the show cars are really nice,  laser cut stainless steel 
\X/ emblems, mounted with a plaque saying what class the trophy is for, with 
a model of the car,  like a square wiundow bug trophy has a model of a square 
window bug, and oval window bug for that class, etc.  it's nice.  only $5 to 
show your car.  might as well, might as well...

Friday 13th at the University Village Burger master 5-9pm
Saturday 14th July (this weekend)  at Shoreline Community College in Seattle 
(exit 175 I think)  spectator entry 9am

this is the last shameless blantant plug for the meet, as I won't have time 
to do any more.

Clara
