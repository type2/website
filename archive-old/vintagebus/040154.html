I have kinda the same idea for my street legal buggy that I am putting 
togeter, only it implies an old siren of a 1950s 1960s (?) (6 volt) fire 
truck.  You cant stand next to it with out earmuffs on! (will run of the 
power to the engine, with a keyed switch (and siren) hidden underneath, and 
the siren btween the body and transmission, out of reach from someone who 
wants to cut the wires.  Why did I choose a siren?  What happens when people 
here a car alarm? Nothing.  What happens when they hear this?  Hey! you as* 
turn that F*ckin thing off!!! and away the burglar goes!

Good day people of bus list -

I spent a lot of this weekend repairing and replacing wiring on my
bus. Thanks be to those color glossy wiring diagrams on Thom's
website. I got to thinking about what little modifications I could
make to confound joy riders and second-rate thieves. Check out my idea
(not yet tested) and tell me if you think this would work. It seems a
little too easy...

Right now the horn  positive wire runs from fuse 8 which I believe is
always hot. I'd move it to fuse 7 which I believe is only hot when the
ignition is on or hotwired at the front of the bus. Then splice into
the horn grounding wire between the horn and horn button with a little
hidden switch, which when closed, grounds the horn. Ignition on,
switch closed: loud noise. Ignition on, switch open: horn functions
normally. Ignition off: no horn, but that's fine.

Well? Clever, too clever, or just plain dumb?

Ps. I finally got some more money and I am buying my bus an engine. I
am leaning towards AVP because I live near Sacramento and the archive
seems to indicate a favorable reputation. Does anyone have a good
reason why I shouldn't buy from them?
