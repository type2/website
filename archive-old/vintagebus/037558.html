Sorry, I just don't understand the appeal.    Just another Ugly Modern 
Minivan, and even if it has \X/ on the front it sure isn't a splitty bus, 
anymore than a eurovan or a jetta is.  

First time I saw a eurovan me and my then boyfriend were taking a road trip 
around, and were in Yellowstone one September about 6 years ago in my 61 
corner window bus that had just been put back on the road that summer.  THis 
meant we had to stop at junkyards and find bits for the bus, like an ashtray, 
and cab door mechanisms (one kept flying open, the other wouldnt open). And 
spare doors as it's doors were rusty. etc. SO we piled the extra stuff on the 
roof rack.   ANyhow, in Yellowstone in this tatty 35 YO SWRED/BG splitty with 
crap piled on the roof rack.   Some German tourists took pics of it.  In fact 
there were more Germans and other foreigners visiting the nat'l Parks than 
Americans.   Driving up the road I saw some ugly minivan  and exclaimed at 
the new depths that modern cars designers are sinking to.  It was a eurovan.  
  The new one goes farther that direction.  yes, just another modern version 
of the transporter.  So what.
