Subject: RE: [VB] Fitting my bus in my garage

Since I have a wooden garage my easy fix was to go rent a sawzall from =
home depot and cut myself the extra 1&quot; plus space (plus bolt in some =
additional structural support) that was required. i also replaced the =
garage doors from one that swung up (and ate up precious headspace) to =
ones that swung open. I can now drive my bus into the garage with the =
westy rack on.

How much height do you have once the bus is in the garage?

Long time lurker, first time poster!!

I have recently moved from an apartment to a house with a garage.  I
finally have a place to work on my '60 Kombi.  There is only one
problem, my garage with garage door hardware seems to only have
approx. 6' of clearance while my bus measures out at about approx. 6'
1&quot;.  I was wondering if any one has ideas/suggestions for getting my
bus into the garage so I can get to work on it.

I believe that pulling the wheels off and dropping it onto some type
of wheeled aparatus would be the way to go, since I plan to do some
major work on the bus (body and engine).

I have seen small metal dollies with casters on them but no idea where
to buy them ( I am in Vancouver B.C). Are these any good.  The ones
that I have seen on the web are expensive.  Is it possible to build a
set of dollies from wooden timbers and caster wheels.  Or has anyone
made any of these dollies from metal, and how have they worked.

No, I don't want to just let the air out of the tires!
