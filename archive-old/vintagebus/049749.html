Subject: Re: [VB] Oil temps and Bosch ramblings (was: Splitty air scoops)

&gt;written by kabayo:
&gt;Oil should certainly reach 220-230 when your engine in warmed up, minimum,
&gt;or else the moisture won't get boiled out.  Look for that scummy whitish
&gt;stuff in your oil cap if you make a lot of short trips w/out getting the
&gt;engine hot.:
&gt;
&gt;220-230 is a fine operating temperature for average conditions but by no
&gt;means would I call this a minimum.
&gt;I do agree that daves temps are low. he always neglets to mention that
&gt;there is an ext cooler on there.


It seems to me that one of the more high-tech adtermarket suppliers (maybe
Gene Berg?) used to offer an oil cooler kit with a thermostat.  The
thermostat routed the oil right back into the engine until a certain
temperature was reached.  I wonder if thoses are still available?

I think a lot of the enthusiasm for aftermarket oil coolers died down when
the 'doghouse' style oil cooler setup became widely available (I'm dating
myself here).
