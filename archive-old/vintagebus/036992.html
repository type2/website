 available. It has a depth of 29.7 mm. &gt;&gt;

Hi Al,
We measured the right rear axle and nut on our 1960 panel camper conversion 
with 1966-67 suspension in it.  The nut and tip of the stub axle is 24mm so 
the socket depth you are looking at will work fine.  We just hope the 1/2 
drive holds up to the task!  We used to use Craftsman 1/2&quot; drive breaker bars 
and snapped them off easily.  Then went to 3/4&quot; Craftsman breaker bars and 
still bent and eventually snapped one after another off.  The only breaker 
bar we have not been able to bend let alone break is the Proto 3/4&quot; breaker 
bar and it is only about $10.00 more than the Craftsman 3/4&quot; breaker bar.
