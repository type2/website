I have to agree with ZR72 here.... use some penetrating oil on your wallet
hinges and buy a new disc.

If you do not get all of the oil off, the disc will disintegrate in the bell
housing. Petroleum products will destroy the compound that the friction
material is suspended in.
Reatil on a new disc is $25. If you shop around you will find them cheaper
still...

&gt; &lt;&lt; I'm too cheap to buy a new one so any kind of shade-tree

&gt;
&gt; You are kidding right??  They are about $25.  Let me see you would rather
&gt; pull the engine TWICE.  Once to try and burn off the oil from your disc
and
&gt; then the second time to replace it after it has really gone??  I truly
don't
&gt; get it.
