&gt;Its a 66 walk through standard built 1st November 65.  lotus white/ lotus
&gt;white paint (uncommon) and mesh grey interior.  they started the 9 digit
VIN
&gt;in 65.  The first part of the Vin is the model, 2 (bus) 8 (walkthrough
&gt;standard) which is the first two numbers in the first set of numbers in the
&gt;bottom line if the m code tag. Its a typ 28, not a tvp 28.  The last set of
&gt;numbers (7 digits) on the bottom line is the rest of the vin, the 6 means
&gt;sixty -6- model year, and the rest is the serial number of yours, so your
vin
&gt;is 286 051 365, which is stamped in the plate on the side of the fresh air
&gt;vent.
According to Thom's fix in the registry it is not white over white but
Torquoise over turquoise.  I found an old picture in the bus and I can just
make out an all white bus. I'm assuming that my bus is white on white. Any
help? thank you.

Rob
