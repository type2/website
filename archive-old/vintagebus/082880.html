Subject: '59 Single Cab...little rocker welded in

I did some welding this weekend on the '59 Single Cab. Got the inner 
rocker on the passenger side welded in. I drilled holes to &quot;spot 
weld&quot; it in with my Lincoln MIG, but didn't have the heat turned up 
enough so did get good penetration. I got lazy with it being a hidden 
area so didn't bother grinding the bad welds away. Didn't drill holes 
in the rocker this time either. I just cranked up the heat on the 
welder real high and burned right through the rocker metal. Did it 
all fast and quick and it's on there now. Just not real pretty I 
guess. Sprayed some flat black Rustoleum on it all.

Also got the little rear wheel well area rocker welded in. I did a 
lot better with this one since I had been &quot;warmed up&quot; with the inner 
rocker. I think it came out great.

The wheel well lip was too short on the Wolfsburg West piece, but I 
just faded the original wider lip into the narrower one and it looks 
just fine for me.

I &quot;butt welded&quot; the whole thing in. Shouldn't need any bondo or 
anything at the welded areas. At the most a tad bit of glazing putty. 
Probably just some filler primer though.

Anyway, I'm trying to update my site again and have started putting 
stuff up. I got pictures of the little rocker deal here:
