&gt; what do you mean by splitcase axles?   
Don't the splitcase axles go together differently?  I recall you had some
problems installing early axles in later bus?  I was told an old timer
local rebuilder that seems to know quite a bit about this stuff that they
were different legnths.  As a result I just bought an entire transaxle
from Ronnie.  The reduction boxes are the same as I understand it.  I'd
like to know if people have swapped axles from splitcase transmissions to
tunnel type with no problems.  Two or three people mentioned to me that I
could not use the axles, so I'm interested in other peoples experience
with this.  Clara I assume you have switched some of these around with no
problems?

&gt; front rubber mount from th e tunnel trans,  and use a metal adaptor plate, 
&gt; available fro\m Bus Boys, or local manufacture.  No cutting/ welding 
&gt; neccessary.
Wrong on my bus.  I tried to fit the busboys plate.  Too thick.  I know
this plate normally works, but I sat under there quite a while, measured
this and that over and over again.  I could have cut out a big slice in
the adaptor and turned it backwards to make it work maybe. Bus boys
actually told me some people do that.   The adaptor
placed the transmission way too much to the rear.  I ended up doing as
Ronnie suggested and put in a regular bus mount, make up a plate and have
it welded in.  I would say it's likely that the solid mount will work for
most people.  As a matter of fact I have two of them I can bring to Jerome
if anybody is interested in buying one for a good discount.:)  
I'm glad I did it by putting a stock rubber mount in now, but I would have
taken the easy way out if the solid mount had worked.

Looking for the answer on the axles.
