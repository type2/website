Hello list,
  I need some info from the collective.  I'm planning on purchasing some
windows from another listee and need to find out if anybody has had them
shipped before.  Will MailBoxes do it?  Or maybe UPS?  What's my best
option folks!

depends if the are laminated or tempered.  If they are tempered (Sekurit logo)
they are very sturdy-   wrap them up with a couple layers of cardboard around
them, between each one, make sure they won't slip around.    They are fine.  I
dropped an intake manifold from ten feet up on a piece of tempered vw glass
and it just bounced off.    I mailed some to someone.

But- if it is laminated- sigla or delog logo, be very very careful.  wrap them
in much bubble wrap and pray .   they can crack almost if you look at them.
I think the mailbox places suggest two inches padding (bubble wrap, or some
such)
