.....&quot;&quot; The dual circuit master came early in 67 model
year if you have M code 430. My 67 Standard is vin #
227000625 and it was built 05 7. That is the 5th of
July, 66. It has M code 430, dual circuit 
master. It does not have backup lights......&quot;&quot;

Hey Karl
By vin number, my bus (237000559) was built only 66
busses sooner then yours yet my M tag date code reads
06 07, although the 'official' Birth Certificate says
the the production date is July 05 1966. You say yours
was built the same day as mine but your M-Code reads
05.. which should be earlier then mine. Its a mystery
to me...BTW, my 67 has the single circuit MC and no
backup lights.
