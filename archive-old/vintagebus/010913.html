Hi NQ,
Remove the insulation from the wires until you get to clean non-corroded 
material.  Then get a bottle of either pure phosphric acid or Naval Jelly 
from you local hardware store.  Piant the ends of the wires with this and go 
away for an hour.  Go back and wipe off the excess chemical with paper 
towels, and then use a small wire brush to comb the wires to clean them.  
Just make sure to comb away from you!  Then install heat shrink, solder, and 
shrink the heat shrink.    Eric&amp;Barb
