Not on crack but the bank account looks like I am! ;-)

I gave up trying to convince anyone that I'm right
about anything. Steering dampeners, no steering
dampener, the(true, perceived or popular)value of any
make model or year regardless of its condition,
rarity, popularity and/or driveabilty. I gave up
trying to convince anyone about any aspect of a bus
that was the one of the nicest of the 50 known
examples &lt;&quot;customized via do it YOUR way&quot;&gt; of barndoor
&lt;era&gt; bus that was one of 500 &lt;of a particular
1949-1955 body style&gt; ever produced. Stupid me. That
bus was much nicer than the popular crackhead
opinions.

For me, I found that VW's aren't what I thought that
they were all &quot;cracked&quot; up to be. Almost literally
woke up one morning and suddenly could care less about
owning, driving or working on VWs. More realistically,
I woke up one morning and had alot of new stresses and
responsibilities and didn't have the time or energy.
Now I know why kids are sometimes referred to as the
little suckers. (I'm sure most everyone can relate).
There is that little twinge of enjoyment that I still
notice when I have the time. Y'all go have fun now...
I'm out. 

Good luck to all of the sellers who are now wearing my
shoes by endlessly posting and reposting the same
vehicles for sale. I just wore the shoes a year
earlier.

GWB: We are in a recession, CIA in Central America is
back in the news, energy prices are up, mainstream
media is in full spin cycle and there's a threat of
war. Ah it's JUST like having Dick, Ronnie and Daddy
back in office! Whew-hoo!
