Every other manufacturer seems to be doing fine, walking the wide line between
trademark protection and a pogrom on the enthusiasts.

&gt; less of that as time slips by) that to keep a copywrite or trademark, the
&gt; owner has to defend it. If that is truely the case then VW is between a rock
&gt; and a hard place. They can't really support us and keep their rights. I just
&gt; hope that they hunt for infringement as little as they can in order to save
&gt; their rights.
