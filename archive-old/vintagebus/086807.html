Subject: Buses by the Trax/ John Brown Buses

Hey everyone it's that time of year again when our minds wander to a nice
campout in the woods. Come join us for some fun along the Potomac River and
the C&amp;O Canal. John Browns Buses has had a name change to Buses by the Trax.
This is our second year camping at the Brunswick Family Campground in
Brunswick Md. The campout is Oct 5-7. This will coincide with the Railroad
Days in the town of Brunswick. I will be taking t-shirt orders again this
year. The slogan for this years shirt is &quot;Train Your Bus To Camp&quot; The shirts
are the same price as last year. $20 for long sleeve and $15 for short
sleeve.
If you send me an email please let me know if you want short or long sleeve
and what size. If anyone has items that they would like to donate for door
prizes please let me know. For more information visit the website at
http://mysite.verizon_dot_net/vze292s2/busesbythetrax/

 Can someone please forward this information to the vanagon list and the
vintage list?

Thanks and hope to see you there. We had great fun last year.

Sharon
