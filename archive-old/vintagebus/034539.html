Hi Jeremy,
That will do nicely if you as always take your time.  It often takes us a 
whole weekend to do a simluar job on our and friends buses.  You might have 
to take pieces of windshield frame out of a donor bus since the side and top 
areas should be in mint rust free used shape.  Unfortunitly this only works 
in the straight areas due to the fact that each of the corners are different 
&gt;from another, so you can not take a top corner and use it for a lower 
corner..  

&lt;&lt;The passenger side dogleg is in bad shape, how much do they cost, and how 
hard is it to replace it.  the drivers side is not great, but it is better 
than the passenger side.&gt;&gt;
You might want to contact folks in the SW of USA for donor rust free sheet 
metal for these and your floor.

&lt;&lt;How hard it it to install the IRS transmission kit?  Are the lower spindles 
worth the
 money?  If I install a IRS transmission, and 3.5&quot; lowered spindles what kind 
of rim/tire combo am I going to need to get?&gt;&gt;
Well the best thing to figure out is why or if you want to lower your bus and 
how are you going to use it.  If you plan to use it as a hauler then you will 
encounter problems of tires rubbing the underside of your bus.  Plus the 
lower the smaller the tire diameter needed to clear the body and thusly the 
higher the engine RPM you will need to keep up with highway traffic.  Thus 
removing the higher speed advantage of not having reduction gear boxes.

&lt;&lt;Does anyone have patch panels for the bed floor?  It has one had hole and 
some pin holes.  I was thinking of sandblasting it and fiberglassing the 
holes from the bottem, and the getting the bed sprayed with Rhino Liner.&gt;&gt;
Again the SW of USA should have donor sheet metal.  Fiberglass and Rhino 
Liner are bad ideas.  Have recently found out about zinc spray method that 
coats thin sheet metal reinforcing and rust proofing the metal.  You might be 
able to find shop that does the same process in your area.  Eric&amp;Barb
