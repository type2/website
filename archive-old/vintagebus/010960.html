Hi Volks!

&quot;Douglas Lloyd&quot; &lt;DouglasWLloyd_at_classic.msn_dot_com&gt; wrote to the List:
&gt; But the recent threads on hauling &amp; towing made me wonder, if buses are rated 
&gt; for such stupendous loads, why is towing verboten?  Seems to me to be the same 
&gt; burden, whether pulled or carried.

Well, no.  :-)  You're forgetting wind resistance in your equation, and the 
additional resistance from the wheels of what you're towing.  These are major 
factors.  You'd hardly notice 350 kg of additional weight in a bus, right?  
Well, you do notice a 350 kg caravan trailer.  Ask me how I know.  :-)

But who says towing is a problem?  It's just a matter of how much.  With a 
Splitty, I think the max legal towing weight is 600 kg, might be 800.  I'd say 
from out of my feeling more than 500 would be hard on the van, but up to it 
would be okay, again strongly depending on the shape (i.e., wind resistance) of 
the trailer.

Hope this helps.

Yours,
    Erik.
