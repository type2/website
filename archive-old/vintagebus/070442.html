Hello,

     Hi, Matt Borbonus here, I was on the vintage bus list some time ago,
and I was curious if you would do a favor for me.  If not, if you could let
me know how to get joined back up on the list I'd appriciate it.  The favor
I ask, is if you could ask the list if anyone has a good running 1600cc
motor for sale, ready to be run on the road, or people who would rebuild one
in or around Pennsylvania.

thanks!
Matt

My guess would be Boston Bob or Salem Imports (in Virginia).
