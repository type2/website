I am going to the Classic on Long Beach.  only thing is I live in Pensacola 
FL.  So i need some places to shit, shave and shower. any vw people want to 
welcome me?  I need places to set up tents for camping.   Me and 3 friends 
are coming.  Me and 1 guy in my Lowered 65 beetle and the other is a Lowered 
66 beetle.  were all 18 years old.  We don't cause havok were a cool group of 
guys.  NOT GAY! just VW CRAZY!  I wish i was in the bus  it would be alot 
better but the bus resto is taking too long.  Maybe next year.  I'll have the 
Sticker on the back of my beetle though.  &quot;I'd Rather PiMP a VW BUS!&quot;   but 
anyone out there have a place to stay or spare parts or want to hang out on 
the way or maybe if you want ride out with us.  Maybe you can point us to 
where the chicks hang out in your town.  We are leaving June 1st plan to be 
in Stockton June 9th then cruise down with a bunch of folks from there.   
ALSO any one have a TTT?  transporter Tourist and traveler directory that 
they can fax me???  I'm not in NEATO  but im not in SOTO either!  but i won't 
tell.  I really want to join so if you also send out an application i will 
join NEATO!     THANKS
