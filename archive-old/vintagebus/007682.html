Hi,

Loctite makes a product that is used to fix threads. However, I think
the hole needs to be fairly clean of oil. Basically, coat the bolt
with mold release, mix up the goo, spread it on the bolt threads, scrw
it in and wait 12-24 hours. It is supposed to allow torque to original
specs. However, a large one here, an engine gets hot and loctite
normally loses strength at elevated temps. It may not work that well,
you could try the JB weld route, again, starting with clean threads is
important.
Chris
