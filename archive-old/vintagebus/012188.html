Subject: Double/Crew cab wanted
Date: Mon, 30 Nov 1998 17:51:55 PST

Does anyone know of or have a double/crew cab for sale. Nothing thats 
been totally restored, but not looking for a major project. I have my 
'62 bus and will regret getting rid of it, but I am leaning more towards 
a double cab. If you know of one in the southeast, please email me off 
list. 
 
My '62 can be seen at:
