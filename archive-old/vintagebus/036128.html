&lt;&lt;hi all,

I have been seriously considering outfitting my 61 with safaris...

But i do have a question...

I have heard talk of an indentation in the upper window channel for safari
mounting plates... i dont see such a thing on my bus (but not knowing what
it looks like im a bit stumped anyway...)

Post 63 (I think) busses have an indentation to allow for more clearance of 
the dash. Pre-62 safari busses always had problems with the dash tabs 
clearing the latches. Frames 55-67 were always the same shape/dimensions but 
there were two different manufacturers for them.

Are earlier and later safaris different for this reason, and which type of
setup are aftermarket safaris tooled for... will i need to modify
something to get it all to fit right?

Took me 9 hours to install the creative engineering safaris into my 58 
singlecab. Hammering, grinding.......a pain in the A**!

thanks,

Steve
