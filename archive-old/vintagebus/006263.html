Subject: paint color question for 1967 deluxe
Date: Wed, 21 Mar 2001 16:06:49 -0800
	charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;

Hello all,
I'm having my 1967 21win walkthrough restored.  The original paint, which is
couple layers down, was L555 - Titian Red / L472 Beige gray.  I like the
Titian Red, however the Beige gray that I see in color samples is not
appealing to me.  I have browsed several VW galleries on the web, and have
seen many beautiful buses that have a top that is (for lack of a better
term) more of a crisper white than the beige gray.  Since I am neophyte here
I'm wondering if there is a white color that is commonly used of which I am
unaware.  I'm trying to stick with a color code that was available '67, thus
I have been considering Cumulous white &amp; Pearl white potential options.  I
realize color preference is subjective, and at the moment I am leaning
toward Cumulous white, but if anyone has any advise on color choices or
pictures where the color is known I would be very appreciative.
Thank you,
HK
