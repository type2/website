Subject: Re: [VB] Westy cabinet installation

Clara, 

Don't forget that there is a piece of wood on the cabinet that matches
the exact &quot;funny bend&quot; in the bracket.  Its a sort of wedge shape.  Hard
to describe.

&gt; There is a metal U channel that attaches to the side door with 4 screws along
&gt; the top of the door panel.   The spice rack hangs on this.  At the bottom an
&gt; L bracket is screwed to the middle of the rack and door.  I have seen people
&gt; use two L brackets at the top if they are missing the channel.
