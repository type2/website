I tried to get one too after hearing about it months ago. I had went out to
the site and read all the flowery statements but after no response to any of
my e-mails I finally sent them one last angry e-mail telling them that they
should include the words &quot;for information only, not for sale at any price.&quot;

I tried to get one, then gave up after about a month. Also, you can't
use the oil bath cleaner, according to them.
If you do searches for FISH CARBS, you willl find some vintage articles
about them. Someone described (I think they are on this list) having one
on a Datsun years ago, and got goo dmileage and crisp throttle response.
Can't be as good as CIS though.
The hours labor/price point doesn't seem to matchup, that's a good
point.
