I know I've been talking a lot about the upcoming VW show in KCMO but I
wanted to make sure that any listees who attend do their best to look me up.
My intent is to be there for as much of it as a I possibly can.  Look for
the white over red 13 window deluxe with Nebraska plates.  I wouldn't be
surprised if I'm the only one there.  I'll be a big guy in overalls and a
bandana more than likely.

Later!
