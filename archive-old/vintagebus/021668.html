Dear Listless...I mean Listees,
I've been reluctant to ask if anyone had this part, but since several
folks have been putting their parts needs on ...here goes.
My '66 S/C is missing the inner receiver for the clip on the 2/3 seat to
clip into.
It's the part on the bus itself...not on the seat...sure would like to
install that seat!
Would also like to find a cover for the compartment under the seats...
Should have her on the road within a month...
Thanks people,
Susan
