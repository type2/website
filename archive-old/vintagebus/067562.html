Subject: transmission problem

After replacing the engine  in my 65 bus and it was running great to BBB and 
around town,  I heard a snap and lost all gears.  Pulled the engine again and 
the clutch release bearing LEVER is broken on one side.  Now there is nothing 
for a new release bearing to snap into....   What can I do?  Is this lever 
replaceable or am I looking at a new tranny?  I was planning on leaving for 
Mount Shasta on Wednesday but now.....

Jon
