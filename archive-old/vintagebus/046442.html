I agree.  My experience of this is using a  (21? 22? mm)55-66 MC on my BD, 
and the brakes were really hard.   When I got a rebuildable barndoor (19mm I 
think) MC the brakes had more give and felt right.   So thinking about going 
to a larger MC ID - yup sponge city. would make the brakes more spongy.   The 
BD  system has one cylinder each front wheel like a bug, and has the same ID 
MC as a bug.   The 3/55 buses have 2 cyls each front wheel, and a larger ID 
MC.     Also the wheel cyl ID is different  3/55-&gt; buses have larger IDs than 
bug or BD.   Probably a correlation.
