no gas getting from the tank through the  line and into the fuel pump.  What
is goin on and what can I do to get  the gas up to the pump?  I tried to
syphin the gas but it still wouldn't come through.

===================================================

maybe a kink in the line, at least that's what Jack Maynard and I figured
out after we sucked gas for some guy in a notch who had the same problem
after taking his tank out, we took out his tank unkinked the line and what
do you know it started, still remember that awful taste, had to drink the
dogs water, That guy still owes jack 10 bucks, I think we scared him two
hillbillies in a bus both dressed the same in bib overalls, full swap meet
