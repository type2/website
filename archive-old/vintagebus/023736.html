Subject: 65 Samba update.

Just thought i would update you all on how my resto is going.

The shell on the bus is 95% done as far as bodywork goes.  All i have to
finish is the drivers door which is not cooperating with me on getting a
ding out smoothly.  Otherwise, the body inside and out is done.

I am picking up all my window frames, one door, bumpers and other misc
stuff from the sand blasters tommorow.  I will start working on that
stuff shortly.  I have one cargo door done as with the rear hatch.

I plan to take the bus over to the Bus Stop (Charlie Hammils place) next
week to have safari brackets welded in and a window hinge replaced.
(made a new on today at work)  After that, i will go back over the bus
and do all the fine sanding in prep for sealing and painting.  My goal
was to shoot the bodyof the bus by the end of July.  That may be a bit
optimistic, but hey it's a goal.

At the classic, i decided on the color and interior scheem for the bus.
Sealing wax red and biege grey.  That is not correct for this bus (Sea
blue and white), but i already have a seablue bug and don't want another
blue car.  Besides i have alway's wanted a SWR/BG bus.  The interior is
going to be as close to factory as i can get.  I found a guy at the
classic who had a very nice clone of the salt and pepper material.  I am
going to use that insted of searching high and low for original stuff.
I have 60% of the original stuff already, but i don't want to have a
freshly painted bus with a original, but not pristeen interior.

I am currently searching for my missing parts also.  that has been a
adventure as it seems there is not too much deluxe stuff available out
there.  Oh well, the search goes on.

That is where the bus stands right now.  Many hours into it and many
more to go.

Thanks and God Bless
Matthew
