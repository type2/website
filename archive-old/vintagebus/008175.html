On my 77 there is a casing mounted between the front of the engine and the tube
mounted to the body. When I replaced my cable I had to remove the casing end
from the tube, slide the cable in more from the front, stick the cable into the
casing, then put the casing back on the tube.

But what do I know......every post I have replied to has been pooh poohed as BS.

&gt; Anyone have some hints when the new one refuses to go in? Have all but about
&gt; 3 feet with push pull push pull. I am at a standstill and had to come back
&gt; to work for a while. I hate busses sometimes. I am desperately trying to get
&gt; this poor girl running before the High Country Bus Fest. New engine in, all
&gt; new fuel lines, fresh seals, then this. I do not even know if it will start.
&gt; :-(
