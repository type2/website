&lt;&lt; Could any of you tell me when VW offered the trip speedometers?&gt;&gt;
Hi David,
Since at least the early 1950s.
 
 &lt;&lt;Also, can anyone give me some pointers in restoring one... i.e. how to 
clean
 them without trashing it?&gt;&gt;
Best to practice on four or six normal ones to begine with and then try your 
hand at the trip speedo.  Or just mail it to one of the many VDO approved 
repair shop around the world.   
 
  &lt;&lt;  I'm in need of two black knobs (the screw on type for the the heater
 control, headlight switch, etc) and the dome light switch that goes on the
 dash.  Anybody have these? &gt;&gt;
For what year?  1955-66 or 1967 only?   Eric&amp;Barb
