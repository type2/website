&lt;&lt; That is, those areas on either side that are
 up above the top of the engine bay?  I think I'll try a mirror to see up
 there but when I reach my hand up there I can feel a roughness that feels

Hi Jdd,
Have them sandblasted to remove as much of the rust as possible.  Por does 
not work well over thick rust.  Personally we would have it sandblasted, then 
primer it with high zinc content primer and then paint it whatever color 
paint.  Eric&amp;Barb
