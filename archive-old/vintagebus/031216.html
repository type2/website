No one answered my question concerning the engine numbers. is a block
marked with three O's a factory replacement block?

I think I may have found a driveaway tent for my westy. I was in a
machine shop that I just did a sign for at actuel materials cost (may be
the brightest thing I ever did), and the guy I did the sign for was
reparing a tent pole for some girl he knows. He said she just purchased
this tent at a yard sale and was gonna put it on ebay. Except for the
pole he is repairing, it sounds like the one I need. One thing I am not
sure of though is, he thinks it has an external frame. I thought westy
tents had an internal frame. Can anybody shed some light on this? Even
if its for a sundial, I may get it because it would likely work, would
look great and could always be used for trade material to get the
correct tent.
