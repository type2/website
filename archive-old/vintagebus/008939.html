&gt; Slightly similar to that of the beetle yet they are square and contain a
screen.  They are right above the lower hinge about 3 to 4 inches and about
the same from the front of the door.  They appear to be a barndoor only
item,
possibly African only?  Any of you have any information on what market these
were for and from what years?
&gt;
You mean &quot;crotch coolers&quot;?

I've seen them in pics from some African safari paper I have, that's all I
know.  I don't think they were all Barndoors but I'd have to check.
