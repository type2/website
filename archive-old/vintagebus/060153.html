Subject: Gas tanks

I spotted a 69 and a 70 bay bus at a wrecking yard near me [Fresno, Calif].
They have 15 gallon fuel tanks in them. I did not look under them to see if
they were punctured, almost all are now in California, but they weren't from
the back. I was going to go back tomorrow morning and grab them [if they are
not ruined from underneath]. These work very well to put in 67 and back buses
to upgrade from the 10 gallon tank.
Is there any interest at all in these?
I could bring them to Jerome if shipping is a problem.
They would probably be in the $35-40 price range with the sending unit. And
yes, the sender will work on 6 volts.
