Subject: Re: [VB] Turnsignal switch

&gt;
&gt;I just bought a NOS turnsignal switch of the somba and it turns out that
&gt;the switch is for european models and i need to get european tail lights
&gt;if i want to use it. [...] does anyone know a way i can use the switch
&gt;with out trying to get euro lights?

You _might_ be able to use a trailer tail light converter.  This is
designed for vehicles that have separate red brake lights and amber
turn signals to tow a trailer that has combined red brake/turn lights.

One end of the converter will have left/right/stop/tail/ground wires
and the other end will have left/right/tail/ground wires.  You'd wire
it in up under the dash - the left/right/stop end goes to the wires
at the turn signal switch and the left/right end goes to the wires
that go to the back for the lights.

This may not work 100% because these converters may depend on having
some more bulbs in the circuit to work.  I think they are doing some
funny things with sneak grounds and stuff but I have never sat down
and played with one enough to be sure.  Having the front turn signal
bulbs in the circuit _may_ be enough but I don't know for sure.

&gt;finally, if i were to come across some euro lights can i use them in 
&gt;my bus with the american harness?

Yes, but you'll have to make a few changes.  Right now, your Bus has
four wires running from front to rear for the rear lights:
left stop/turn
right stop/turn
left tail
right tail/license plate

A Euro bus has five wires:
left/right stop
left turn
right turn
left tail
right tail/license plate

What you can do is wire the left tail light on your Bus to the right
tail light.  This frees up the former &quot;left tail&quot; wire, giving you
the extra wire that you need.  The functions of the wires on your
Bus will change like so:

was:                           is:
left stop/turn            --&gt;  left turn
right stop/turn           --&gt;  right turn
left tail                 --&gt;  left/right stop 
right tail/license plate  --&gt;  left tail/right tail/license plate
 
The only drawback to this is that you're one fuse away from not having
any rear illumination at night, so if you do this, make it a point to
check your tail lights from time to time.

If you want details on the exact hookup, post back and let us know.
