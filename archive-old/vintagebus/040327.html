Phil,

I wouldn't put POR15 over 'old' paint.
Its to seal rusty or blasted metal that
has some 'tooth'.  It's also a 'rough'
finish and not entirely suited to the 'show'
areas of your bus (ie the outside) but good
for for chassis and 'hidden' areas.

For new clean metal use an etching primer
followed by one of the 'high-build' primers.  Spray
and sand the high-build in cycles until surface is suitable
for top-coat.

For old paint which has been rubbed back (but paint
is still covering the panel) go straight to a high-build
primer...
