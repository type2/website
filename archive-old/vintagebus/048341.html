Chris Burke a fellow member in stranded int the Warner and Kyrene area in 
Tempe, AZ.  he ended up trading his 61 sundial for a 59 ero ragtop beetle and 
he has only owned it for a week.  From what he is describing it sounds like 
he blew a plug out the head.  He says its stripped out and cant get it back 
in. If anyone can help let me know.  We need help towing it from that area to 
67th avenue and baseline rd.  Any phoenix listees with a trailer or towbar?

My number is on AIRS if anyone decides to contact me.
