&gt; Hi Cal,
&gt; If you remove just the spark plug wire you will have about a 50% drop in HP.
&gt; If you remove the rocker arms to that cylinder, the piston and connecting rod
&gt; and figure a way to hose clamp the oil port from the crank shut you will
&gt; loose about 33% HP.  Check your ignition system and if that does not do the trick
&gt; you really need to drop the engine and have a set of heads ready to replace
&gt; your old ones.  Otherwise if it is a strecthing valve it could take out the rest
&gt; of the engine at any time!

Yeah, that's what I've been suspecting from the beginning. I've got a
bunch of checks tomorrow, but ultimately, that 4 mils recession plus the
symptoms have me thinking to pull the plug and pushrods, leave the piston
in there. That would turn off the cylinder, and leave the possibly failing
valve motionless. I drove 200 miles in 86 back home to OKC on 3 cylinders
like that once, made it back just fine, and was able to work on the engine
at home. Have you ever had any experience or suggestions regarding the
above bandaid? That's my real question to the list, though the
list's suggestions have been a great reminder of things to check as well.
