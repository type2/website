&gt; Time for a new main seal?

Hi Jason,
A small amount of oil especially in the bottom of the bellhousing is fine.  
Check any of the Bentley manuals for AC VWs and you can see pictures of this 
oil accumulation.

&gt;&gt;BONUS QUESTION:  Ever notice the tranny gear oil and
engine oil smell distinctly different? &lt;&lt;

It sure does, due to the tranny oil having sulfur in it.
