&gt;Anyway, the weather is looking pretty crappy for this weekend:
&gt;http://www.weather_dot_com/weather/cities/us_ca_san_jose.html
&gt;The '55 westy leaks like a seive; not sure I want to take it if
&gt;it's raining...
&gt;
Kelley Park  (dammit!)

Hey, it rained here in Phoenix a couple days ago, I stuffed some shop towels
up on the dash to stop the water.  POS original seals, you'd think they'd
last more than 44 years!

I'll be at Kelley Park, too, I put a scan of my shirt on my web site.  Look
for me, if you so desire, I'll be arriving in one of those freaky late model
Deluxes with the full dash and all that shiny crap ('63 Green/White Hardtop
Deluxe).  If you promise not to come up and punch me, I'll let you drive my
Bus around the campsite at Jerome...
