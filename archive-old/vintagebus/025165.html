Thanks to Dave, Pete and John for your quick response, you all ask
basically the same question; &quot;does it turn over easily by hand, when
it's hot&quot; I don't know, I'll try that when I get home this evening. What
are you guys thinking if it doesn't? What if it does?
John asked about the starter; I double-checked this by reinstalling the
original starter, and neither starter had any different result. I just
rebuilt the engine over the winter, if you are thinking this is a
mechanical problem, I'd like some tips on where to look next.
thanks
John
