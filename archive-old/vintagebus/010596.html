ah- but a 71 it not a splitty.  On a splitty the muffler is set diffently - 
and the taillpipes come out at bumper level.  Which is why they make piptail 
tailpipes for the splitties, and L shaped ones for the bays.   Would have 
expected it to hit the apron though.

-  I couldn't tell any difference between the bus muffler and
the bug muffler despite the much smaller tailpipe flow area of the bus
muffler.

I now have a nice new bus muffler and tailpipe waiting to be
installed.  Oddly, the Dansk tailpipe is much larger in diameter than
the original bus tailpipe.  I don't know if this is significant.

I don't have the best rear hatch seal in the world, but I've never
smelled a wiff of exhaust in the cabin.  I do smell it when I turn the
heat on with the bus stationary (via the air intakes), but I did with
the bus muffler as well.

have to admit I had a bug muffler on my first splitty (it came that way- ) 
and had the crank apron cut for it and the holes cut in the bumper that the 
tailpipes stuck through.  Also had red and gold naugahyde interior and cost 
less than a rebuildt tranny for it would have cost ten years ago, when it 
needed one.   And all the rubber was bad on it when I got it.  And no I 
didn't get exhaust smell in the bus.   though when the main seal went bad it 
showed up clearly in oil splops all over the back of the bus.     I am sure 
the rear seal wasn't so great, cause once when it was so friggin cold we duct 
taped the back hatch shut to keep it warmer inside, and it worked.

That said, I would never have hacked anything in it.  And still never would, 
and would chastise anyone who did.

One advantage of the bug muffler not yet mentioned is that you are
less likely to ground out the bug exhaust tips then the bus tip while
negotiating rough terrain.  The bus exhaust tip is the lowest point on
the corner of the bus.
