Subject: Re: [VB] Axle Seals.. now other seals??

&gt; If the Axle seals are so variable what about the crank main seal? If it
&gt; leaked a little how would you know unless you had a brand new
&gt; spotless engine. Ive been thinking the one I put in recently isnt much
&gt; better than the old one it replaced.
&gt; so?

I went through four German ones when I built the singlecab engine. Instant
leakers. Went to get a fifth at another branch of one of the VWFLAPS here
and they said they didn't carry the German ones anymore, they had been
having trouble with them leaking. Nice, seems the Phoenix branch was getting
rid of them all. They gave me a Brazilian one, worked the first time and
doesn't leak a drop after two years.
