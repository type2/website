&gt; I think most of the UK Barndoors seem to come out of Finland, Sweden,
those

&gt; Note the LHD, left-hand doors setup on the aforementioned '51 Standard.

true most of them do - fwiw, my 54 came from sunny italy - languised in the
sun for years by the looks of the paintwork..
but why do you say its a LHD? loading doors are on the left ala rhd are they
not.. only looked that close myself a minute ago checking to see if i could
spot any original anti smog fittings to hint at a socal origin. got me
nearly interested enough to give them a bell and find out now. gotta stop
myself doing that! - i'll end up buying it :)
