Subject: Re: [VB] more ridiculous prices

I agree it's a little high, but I know the guy, if he doesnt get good $ for
parts he doesn't make bills, so he sells for what he can, not what's nice.
He also has alot in time, money and effort into recovering his parts. I
guess if you don't want to pay that much for them, the best thing is to not
buy them.

&gt; sunroof rails for $150, but now someone in Eugene is trying to sell them
&gt; for $200!?   Come on. To me that's like holding someone's resto for
ransom.
