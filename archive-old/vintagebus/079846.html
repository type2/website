Subject: [VB] solenoid #30 terminal broken

	Hi List -

		My bus stopped being able to start itself.  Only get a click when turning the ignition key.  It jump starts just fine.  So I crawled underneath and found that the number 30 terminal on the solenoid was no longer attached. 
		The plastic has presumably dried up and was cracked, preventing it from holding on the terminal.  Jumping 30 &amp; 50 will spin the starter.  
		So I need a new solenoid.  But my dilema is that I have no idea what kind of setup the PO's put in.  My bus is a 64 (ser # 13xxxxx ) that was converted to 12v.  I couldn't read anything on the starter or solenoid, and each time I have pulled my motor I forgot to look count the flywheel teeth to find out what they did to convert it.  I remember looking at the bell housing and not seeing any grinding do maybe they are using.
		Having never replaced a starter or solenoid.  Is this an engine pull affair?  Also, how can I &quot;spec&quot; the right solenoid/starter.

		Thanks.
