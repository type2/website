Well, the easy ones I've identified.  It's the ones that aren't listed on the NEATO webpage that I'm having trouble with.  BTW, good progress on the camper kit.  I pulled all of the cabinets over the weekend and began the teadious prep work.  Everything is in really, really good shape.  Rear area seats are going to need to be recovered.  There's just enough tears to warrant completely redoing.  Any leads on original looking fabric?  I can't be the first person who has needed to recover these seats, what do people do to get it close?  These are the gold/black plaid.

O.K., m-code info:

03  11  8
372  F23  168  175  181  544
UF  231  SK  693  (vin #)

03  11   8  = November 3, 1958     
372 = ?
F23 = Westfalia SO23 interior.(Michael H., it goes beyond a,b,c)
168 = 88 ampere/hour battery up (????)
175 = overriders
181 = chrome hubcaps
544 = ?
U = USA
F = port. San Francisco?
231 = Kombi, cargo doors right, LHD
SK = ? It's a Mango Green/White (Seagull Grey?) bus 
693 = ?

One unique thing about this bus is that it came with a factory installed Deluxe clock, but no grab handle.  One of the m-codes could be that.  It also has the Deluxe Westfalia interior (with ice box), maybe that's the F in F23.  Anyone know of another source for m-code interpretation?

TIA.

Robert
