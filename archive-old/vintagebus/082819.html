&gt;&gt;&gt; How does the valve cover seal affect crankcase  pressure?  &lt;&lt;&lt;


Hi John,
We never quite figured out the exact why, but seen it happen.  Which  is 
possibly why VW changed the design of the valve cover sometime in  the 1970s, so 
it had the dimple to help keep the center top of the  seal from dropping down.
 
According to Workshop Bulletin of 15 August 1969:
  Excessive pressure in the crankcase may cause oil to be forced out  of the 
crankcase breather.  The pressure increase can be caused by slipped  cylinder 
head cover gaskets.
  If oil is lost via the crankcase breather, first check the cylinder  head 
cover gasket for proper position.  If a gasket is dislocated, as shown  in the 
illustration, air can enter the crankcase.  This forces oil into the  air 
cleaner or through the condensate drain tube.
  The latter leads to oil dripping on the muffler and may create smoke  
development.
