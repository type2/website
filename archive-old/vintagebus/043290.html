Can you get it going in time with the music?  My 71 has a spring-base
antenna near the passenger pillar and it blows over 30-45 degrees on the
highway with that little EMPI puffball on it.  Scares me to death on a
windy day, with the antenna bobbing and the poptop thrumming and the
whole bus swaying on the sidewalls.  Like it's haunted.

The prices we pay to be cool....  Saw one like a flaming eyeball the other
day, though.  Might have to get that one.
