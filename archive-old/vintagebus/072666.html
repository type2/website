&gt; P.S.  Did I forget to meantion the BEER?  We have a lot of brew houses and
&gt; excellent beer.  Anyone like Black Butte Porter from the Deschutes Brewery?
&gt; That is located in Bend (central Oregon).  It is best from the tap at the
&gt; brewery.  In moderation of course.   :-)

As a native southerner who spend a week in Oregon a few months ago I
can confirm that Black Butte Porter is a very nice beer &amp; Bend is
quite the neat town. If I ever get a chance to move again Oregon would
be one of my first choices. &amp; all the Vdubs we saw were amazing (not
quality but quantity)
