That bus belongs to a friend here in town.  He lives just a few blocks 
down from me.  He has had that bus since 1966 and put MANY miles on it 
including trips to CO, Alaska, and who knows where else.  That bus has 
even been rolled and totalled once by some big truck yahoos getting 
behind him and his son that were in the bus at the time, and pushing 
them with their truck until they were off the road.  But, that didn't 
stop him!  I'm sure many have seen his bus around and he goes to 
Detroit, BNNTA (I was parked next to him this year), Union Grove 
(mofoco), and many others.  We went ice fishing last year just outside 
of town here, I drove my 71 and he drove his bus, and he just slapped on 
the chains and went.  Once that wood stove is turned on (you start it 
with propane that he has hooked up to it) you wouldn't believe how nice 
it gets in there.  If it gets too hot, well, pop one of the 6 custom 
popouts (they open ALL the way up instead of sideways, same with the 
rear hatch window) and it cools down quick.  Many of you may cringe at 
the sight of it, but to me, him, and many others it is a work of art 
still in progress.  He built it to use, not to look at.  All custom 
stainless exhaust with the muffler acting as a 3rd heater box.  In them, 
the air travels through the exhaust instead of around it.  The exhaust 
travels where the air usually would.  I could go on forever about it.  
Many of you have probably seen his works in the OBR or even get post 
cards from him come Christmas time.  If you see him around, stop and say 
hi.  He's quite the guy.  Try to keep up with his snappy humor too.

&gt; Here is a picture of a guys summer seats at BNNTA last year.  He was from
&gt; Wisconsin and had winter seats also.
