&lt;&lt; They all appear to be normal M-codes, nothing Barndoor-specific.  18, 83,
 and 86 are unidentified but I suspect they are either US options or normal
 stuff, both of the vehicles are from the same dealership in CA.  Perhaps
 sealed-beam headlights is one of those codes?
 
 M103 is heavy-duty shock absorbers, I believe this only applied to the rear
 as the fronts on the Truck were the originals and appeared normal.  The
 rears were missing but I have seen heavy-duty lever shocks so I assume that
 is what was on there.  These would be Barndoor-only as they are lever-style
 shocks.  That doesn't necessarily mean it's a Barndoor-specific M-code.

Hmm, the barndoor options mystery continues.  Thanks for all the info so far 
Everett.  I'm going to try to put together a list of Barndoor specific 
options if there is such a thing.  Can anyone else help?   I promise to post 
all the info I get on a new site I'm currently working on.
