Hi Gary,
What month/year was your 63 SC produced?  Our SC is a mid DEC62 and looking 
at the mounting screws it looks to have been mounted in with button headed 
screws rather than the normal stock countersunk slightly domed headed screws. 
 Looks like this mirror might have been dealer mounted for legal or better 
salebilty.  Our truck also came with beauty trim rings with date codes 
exactly in match with the rims date codes of 11/62.  Pretty sure we are the 
third owners.   Eric&amp;Barb
PS Who has the most recent VW bus without an interior mirror or mounting 
holes?  EEE&amp;B
