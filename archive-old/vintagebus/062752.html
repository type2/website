Subject: Who's going to VW Porsche in Cinci?

Just wondering.  My bus just started not idling and when started if you give 
it gas and hold it steady it slowly idles down and dies.  Any ideas?  I 
haven't tore into it yet.  If I get it going we are going to Richmond for 
Busengroovin Sat and driving on to Cinci on Sun.  If not, we may just drive 
down for the show.
