&gt; actually it is a brand new s*ny CD/MP3 player. but i didn't notice anything

&gt; actually the spade type connectors are different sizes so you can only hook
&gt; it up one way.

In the olden days, auto speakers were wired with a hot signal wire from
the radio/tape player, and then grounded thru the car chassis for the
return to the radio.  In modern and sophisticated electronics these days,
the speakers may have two wires specifically for each speaker channel, as
yours are. This is because the power output amplifiers within the radio
are using what is known as a bridge circuit, wherein neither speaker
terminal is grounded - in effect, they are both hot, and must not be
grounded. This is done in order to achieve higher output powers than what
would theoretically be possible given the relatively low 12 volts
available from the battery.

&lt;/tech rant off&gt;
