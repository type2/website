Subject: RE: [VB] Vent Weatherstrip Help

Hi Sue,
I sent my vent wing frames off to BFY Obsolete Parts.  They have a press
that does this operation, like the one they used at the factory.  I had them
install 2 new latches, and with the cost of the latches, new rubber pieces,
installation, and shipping, it cost me about $50 for both frames.  I have
talked to people who keep tearing the rubber trying to install the piece, so
it probably wouldn't take too long to eat up $50 in reordering the rubber
and shipping.  You may want to give them a call.  Turn-around time was about
4 working days.

Let us know how it goes . . .
