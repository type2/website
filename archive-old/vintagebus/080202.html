Subject: RE: [VB] Re: poor gas mileage

&gt; I think that all Bob Donalds Type-1 rebuild have CRsless than 7.0.
&gt; Bob also may suggest the 10* btdc as a starting point but might say its
&gt; ok to advance a bit more if you were to ask him.

True enough; mine is 6.9. I have really got to call him to get his opinion
but I haven't been able to take the time during his availability this week. 

As for gas, I've been using 92/93 when available under $1.80. It's only a
buck or so more than regular for a fill-up. Lately its been mid-grade more
than not. Once we get to California, were gonna have to modify it to run on
pee, cause thats all we'll be able to afford at their prices.

thanks for the advice
