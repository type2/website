[type2 list added to headers. I'm not sure who all I'm CCing here, sorry 
if this mail is going to private parties who aren't too interested.

Ernie,

Not sure how much it would take to get you to walk away, or whether you 
would, but I can tell you based on fairly long history raising funds 
around here that that sum is not out of the question for a good cause 
(although it is a tall order).

It would appear to me that, if you really want to have your show move 
off the plantation, and some aircooled owners are willing to put their 
money where their pie-holes are, then you should open an escrow account 
and try to pull this off. You raise the money, you move the show, and 
you tell VW to kiss off. And try to get media coverage when you tell 
them. If you don't raise the money, you return it. Pretty simple.

If you post anything further you should copy it to the newsgroup IMO.

&gt; The investment in getting the Sunday Festival going is about $3500.

&gt; To break the contract with the host hotel and banquet facility is

&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Bill,
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Ed seems to be saying that the MVVC can't walk away from this venue
&gt;&gt; because, and only because, doing so would hit them in the pocketbook so
&gt;&gt; severely that they couldn't continue to host the show.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; It should be possible to quantify exactly how much money they'd lose if
&gt;&gt; they cancelled their contracts, etc. (at least assuming that cancelling
&gt;&gt; them wouldn't lead to lawsuits, only to penalties) and held the show at
&gt;&gt; another venue.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; If it were possible to raise this much money on line, and give it to 
&gt;&gt; the
&gt;&gt; MVVC to offset those costs, do you think the MVVC would then repudiate
&gt;&gt; VWOA publicly?

&gt; Hi all,
&gt;
&gt; I'm forwarding this to this VintageBus List because I've seen it's
&gt; &quot;subject title&quot; referred to in Steve Lashley and Thom's recent post's,
&gt; but I haven't seen the &quot;body or text&quot; of the post in any digest I've
&gt; received.  Just is case, here are the true facts, right from the mouths
&gt; of the MVVC Officers who host this great Midwest event.  No
&gt; speculation, just the facts...read on and be truly informed, and make
&gt; up your own mind.  I look forward to seeing many of you Midwest VW

&gt; Volkswagen Club
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Recently there have been a rash of e-mail pertaining to the MVVC, it's
&gt; relationship to VWoA and the MVVC May show. I would appreciate if you
&gt; would take a moment to read the following. If you have any questions I
&gt; can be reached at ed_at_mvvc_dot_net
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; What the MVVC is,
&gt;
&gt; A group of 300+ members, primarily in Michigan. We started as a group
&gt; interested in air cooled VW's. As a chapter of the VVWCA we went by the
&gt; guidelines of any VW car 25 years or older being eligible to join. That
&gt; focus was fine tuned in 2001. After two surveys and a vote of the
&gt; membership we have changed the by-laws of the club. While ownership of
&gt; an air cooled VW  is not a requirement to membership, they are the only
&gt; cars in the club. No water cooled VW's. Or to put it another way, the
&gt; theme of this years MVVC show is &quot;Air Is Cool&quot;. We are also a social
&gt; club. The May show is our main event, but we have many other events
&gt; planned around the state of Michigan. For more information on our
&gt; events and our survey on the change to air cooled please go to
&gt; www.mvvc_dot_net
&gt; The May show is our money maker for the year. It funds the show for the
&gt; next year. It also allows us to donate every year to a wide variety of
&gt; local and national charity's and has enabled us to offer no interest
&gt; temporary loans to other VW clubs (you know who you are!), struggling
&gt; or just getting off the ground. Our May show draws primarily from the
&gt; mid west, but we have cars come each year from as far as Maine to
&gt; California as well as Canada. In 1995 the Gene Berg Memorial cruse was
&gt; at our show. In 1999 the DKF club joined us on their way to Bad
&gt; Camberg. This year the DKF club will be attending, and having their
&gt; first ever national meeting at our show.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; What the MVVC is not,
&gt;
&gt; In any way, shape or form affiliated with VWoA or VWAG. We are an
&gt; independent organization founded in 1986 for the enjoyment of air
&gt; cooled Volkswagens. As we are in Michigan, and the majority of members
&gt; in the Metro Detroit area we have over the years had out May show at
&gt; VWoA in Auburn Hills. Our Contract for the show is with the Landlord
&gt; that owns the building VW rents. We receive no monetary support of any
&gt; kind for having our show there. And in the past it was a great place to
&gt; have it. With the building open to view the VW museum it was a little
&gt; something extra we could offer to our show goers. And in the past we
&gt; were happy to be there. VW was, to a degree a friend to the hobbyist,
&gt; and we were happy to have them show their new cars, again something our
&gt; show goers appreciated.
&gt;
&gt;  We are well aware of the headaches that the hobby is currently facing,
&gt; thanks to the _at_#&amp;%  mentality at VW. Remember the 300+ members, well we
&gt; have several that are small business owners (service&amp; parts for VW&quot;s)
&gt; and have felt the wrath of the VWoA legal storm troopers, we do not
&gt; have to read about the VW induced headaches, some of our friends and
&gt; members are living it!. We have agonized as to the location of this
&gt; years show. And like many others we are furious that VW is being so
&gt; underhanded in their dealings with air cooled VW fans and business
&gt; people. We recognize and agree with VW&quot;s right to protect its
&gt; trademarks, but to go about it in such a heavy handed manner, and with
&gt; out any concrete guidelines for the hobby and its related businesses is
&gt; unbelievably stupid, amazingly shortsighted and asinine.
&gt;
&gt; The MVVC show is at VWoA again this year. As this is our &quot;main event&quot;
&gt; we cannot just walk away from this venue, this year any ways, and for
&gt; several reasons. We have signed contracts with the near by host hotel
&gt; (Marriott), landlord for the VWoA property, event permits with the city
&gt; of Auburn Hills, insurance coverage for this specific day and location
&gt; and others. Many of these were signed late last summer, and some have
&gt; very stiff penalties ($$$) for cancellation. Had we known then ,what we
&gt; know now, the show would be at another location!.  We want ALL of our
&gt; show goers to have a good time, to feel comfortable in their
&gt; surroundings, and to enjoy all the events we have scheduled for the
&gt; weekend. If we were to change the venue now, it would financially ruin
&gt; the club. No more events, yearly donations to charity, no more loans to
&gt; other VW clubs. We have been working on several other locations for the
&gt; 2003 MVVC show. If VW continues to abuse the very people that helped
&gt; them along, in good times and bad, then the MVVC in 2003 will be
&gt; somewhere else.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; What you can do,
&gt;
&gt; Come to the show, in your AIR COOLED VW&quot;S!!!. Yes, VOA people will be
&gt; there, let them see what the air cooled hobby is all about, the number
&gt; of people, the enthusiasm for the hobby. Talk to these people, let then
&gt; know how VWoA and VWAG is hurting themselves, their sales and their
&gt; position with the VW hobby. This show is for the air cooled enthusiast,
&gt; don't let its location keep you from enjoying one of the best shows in
&gt; the Midwest, as well as the country.
&gt;
&gt; But if,
&gt;
&gt; The location is too much to handle, you cannot bring yourself to set
&gt; foot at VOA, we understand. We are, at this point not too wild about it
&gt; either, but we are not going to let VW's current mentality destroy our
&gt; show or our club. We do however ask that you not direct your anger at
&gt; us, we are not the bad guys here. We are enthusiasts, just like you,
&gt; and we are, quite frankly, just as PISSED OFF at VWoA as you are.
&gt;
&gt;  We have seen recent e-mail's that suggest you should &quot;blow off the
&gt; MVVC show and come to ours&quot;, that we are &quot;tools of VOA&quot;, and are being
&gt; &quot;prostituted by VW&quot;, pimps, unwitting dupes. In other words, almost as
&gt; moronic as the current reasoning from VW!. I will say it again, WE ARE
&gt; NOT THE BAD GUYS!, DO NOT LET YOUR ANGER DESTROY THIS HOBBY!, or
&gt; promote bad feelings within the hobby. We are all in it together, lets
&gt; keep it together.
&gt;
&gt; Thanks for your time
&gt;
&gt; Ed Karmann, MVVC Secretary
