Subject: Re: [VB] Insulation?

Actually the crazy foam displaces moisture-
But it displaces it right back at the metal.
So the cure for this would be to first either apply some wax based
product--or the best would be to spray some urethane bed liner in the
cavity first--then go ahead and blow the foam in--

Later,

Spray foam is evil.   it traps moisture....   and the cab doors are
designed
so water runs through them.
buses that I have seen w/ spray foam insulation have rust around the
spray foam even if they were solid everywhere else.

My next idea is a little more time consuming but I know will probably
provide the best insulation in terms of both heat retention and sound
deadening - apply a 3M Spray-On Urethane Foam directly to the interior
metal suraface of the door metal that is directly exposed to the
exterior, after all urethane foam
