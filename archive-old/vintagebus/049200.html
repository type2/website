Prototype T2... How about converting a SC into a FWD, tiller-steering vehicle? Turn the front beam around so it tracks, turn the upper cab for windshield stuff. Fiddle with the pedals and tranny for forward speeds. Plenty of room for headlights in the rear. Where's my PhotoShop?

Just looked at a '63 SC here in Fresno, CA. Decent shape, no engine, reported bad tranny, high asking price. Could be a candidate to transer my EV stuff from the Thing if the price would drop. 

I'd invite the travelers by, but I might take their advice and head off before they get here. 

My observations for DIY... It'll take you x times longer, you'll have to buy tools you'll never use again and when you're good at it you have to stop.
There's a lot of local artisans in your local upholstery shops, machine shops, tent &amp; awning places, etc.
