For being free of employment you sure are a whiner. This sucks and that
sucks some more and my dog bites and the light hurts and the music is loud,
etc ad naseum.

Ok I was harsh. But still, some of us are not in our bus day by day. The
last trip...(dreamy music please) before the child and the endless days of
work, was about 2 years ago and it was a great time. I went over 2 thousand
miles and had such a good time, I wish I wasnt working now.  Even when the
bus messed with my head by throwing out a spark plug, we were happy go lucky
and in fun. I have traveled for fun and I suggest you try to do the same. 
Jason.
