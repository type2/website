&gt; Ideas?  Since I plan to use the bus for short trips around the local area,

I'm not a carberation expert, but I'll bet you that if you replace that
009 with a single-tubed vacuum advance distributor, it'll work just fine.

I used 1600's for decades with 30PICT3's and always the vacuum advance
distrib, and never any problems. WHen I first bought my 64, it had a 009
on it powering two carbs, and the bottom-end flat spot could break your
neck in First!
