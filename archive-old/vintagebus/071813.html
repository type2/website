&lt;&lt; I bought a new light, but I need to know how
 the wire gets from the switch on the LH side
 of the speedo to the light.  That switch is currently
 wired in series with the front interior light.
  &gt;&gt;

the wire runs from the switch on the side of the speedo pod, up the drivers 
windsheild pillar, then back along the inside of the roof, then over to the 
switch.   If you still have a headliner in place, use a flashlight and look 
around.   Make sure the switch is flipped off first  :)

The switch is supposed to have hot run to it, hot jump off the hot up to the 
front dome, and the other side of the switch be power for the rear dome.  This 
was the switch activates teh rear but not frotn light.   My 61 was wired so 
the switch activates the front and rear lights when I got it, and I left it 
that way.  just a note that wiring may or may not be stock, might want to check 
with a flashlight and mirror, or fingers.

really annoying to run a new wire.  ick.  are you sure the wire is missing?  
I don't know how you could run a new one with the headliner installed.
