&gt;seems almost like a black hole for these wheels.  I think that the issue
&gt;of &quot;Buses to Japan&quot; would go away if we knew more about their fate once
&gt;they arrived there.  Questions I have are; can you register and drive
&gt;left hand drive vehicles in Japan?  Do japanese owners have access to
&gt;dry garages, parts, knowledgeable mechanics and so on.  Fears I have are
&gt;that some may be used only as cool decorations for japanese nightclubs
&gt;and car dealers only to be scrapped once the novelty wears off.  Of
&gt;course these fears are only products of my imagination.  Might be pretty

Hi everyone,

    I've enjoyed hearing everyones responces on this issue and decided to
through my experiences in the mix. . .

    I lived in Japan for 3.5 years in the late 80s/early 90s when the
nostalga craze really started to take off over there.  There was a VW
restoration/repair shop about 1 mile from where I lived.  I can tell you
that those folks in Japan pay an arm &amp; a leg for their VWs and by law they
are kept in top condition.  Over there, you won't see a clunker belching
smoke down the expressway, in fact, during my time there, I could count the
number of cars &quot;dead&quot; on the side of the road on one hand!! No joke!!

    I never saw an aircooled VW being driven by a *punk* high schooler (no
offence intended to the high schoolers on the list) being neglected
mechanically, it was quite the opposite situation.  Classic cars in general
were being driven by the more upper-class who could afford them.  VWs were
in the same catagory price-wise, as some of the lessor American muscle cars.
I saw in 1990, an nice looking (but nothing special) KG coupe selling for
the equivilent of US$12,500 when a comparable car here in the US would cost
about $5000 Now I won't even try and convince you all that VWs were
everywhere driving around, but I will say that those that I did see on the
road were the equivilent to show quality cars in the &quot;Daily Driver&quot; class or
better.  I've spent a bit of time in the wrecking yards there too and I've
never personally seen one in the stack (not to say they aren't there at all,
just saying &quot;I&quot; had never seen one).

    You CAN take LHD cars to Japan and register, insure and drive them.  In
fact, the US market cars conformed to more stringent safety standards of the
day than were usually required on Japanese cars, so usually they would pass
inspection without a problem.  Are you all starting to see why they come to
the US to get their cars and parts?? :-)  If I were them, I would too. . .

    If I were selling my bus (I even hate to think about that) and a
Japanese car importer were to offer a boat-load of money to me to take it
back home to Japan, I would rest easy that I would be in the hands of
someone who could afford to take care of it, right.  If the buyer were to
tire of it over there, there are dozens of others just waiting to take it
off their hands, all equally able financially since VWs are an upper-class
thing.
