Subject: Found a Double Cab/ Mark Rupert on List?

About three or four weeks ago, A guy stopped me in a gas station and
told me that a friend of his was parting out a Double Cab like mine.  I
called his friend and tried to set up a time to see what I could salvage
from the parts DC.  I finally found the time to run over and take a
peak.  To my surprise it wasn't a bay window but a split!  It was
complete except engine and side gates.

The bus has no title.  When I went to register it on Vintagebus, it was 
already there and submitted by Mark Rupert.  Is he out there or anyone 
know him?
