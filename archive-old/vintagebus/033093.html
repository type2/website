&lt;&lt; t when i go to look at the
 engine-the generator pulley has apparently sheared off. any idea what could
 have caused this? Can I just replace the pulley or will i need to put a new
 generator in? &gt;&gt;
 It sounds from your discription like the hole in the rear (FIF) half or the 
piece that it rides on rounded out. This has been pretty common (for me 
anyway)  when using the aftermaket junk made in the third world country of 
your choice. If this is the case a new pully and belt should fix it.
