George, All,
	Driving insanely fast down some dusty roads north of Flagstaff, AZ,
I've noticed that the fine red volcanic dust neatly adhered to the sides
of the &quot;scooped&quot; '67.  The dust adhersion was thickist past the rear
cargo doors, actually aiming towards/into the scoops.  This makes me
think that the air does flow fairly smoothly over the bus body.  The
&quot;scoops&quot; built into the loafs is placed high enough to where the cooling
air is a bit cleaner.  I notice that the engine compartments in well
sealed non-scooped buses are much hotter than scooped.   They are also
much cleaner.  My engines seem to run too cool.  The scoops are a bit
over the top in the '67 6.6-1 CR 1600sp.  Gary Gibson   Tucson,  AZ
