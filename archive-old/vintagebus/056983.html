&gt; I've been lurking on this list for the last few
&gt; months, ever since I got the itch for a split
&gt; window. 
&gt; Well, today I brought my first one home, a 63'
&gt; westy. 
&gt; It's rough, but not too far gone and pretty darn
&gt; good
&gt; for this area ( Western NY state).  Anyway, here are
&gt; some of the first questions I've come up with...
&gt; 
&gt; What are the correct wheels for this vehicle, 14&quot; or
&gt; 15&quot;?  The seller has offered me either size...( It
&gt; currently has 15&quot; beetle wheels)
&gt; 
&gt; It has a 1600 dp with a 2 barrel carb.  The manifold
&gt; had PIS cast on it.  How can I identify this to
&gt; order
&gt; a rebuild kit?
&gt; 
&gt; The above carb has very little clearance for an air
&gt; cleaner...there fore the previous owner ran it
&gt; without
&gt; one.  It has two studs for mounting one.  The engine
&gt; runs fairly well, but I'm sure it will need a
&gt; rebuild
&gt; shortly.  Any ideas what type of cleaner I need for
&gt; this setup?  
&gt; 
&gt; I would like to rebuild the wheel cylinders vs
&gt; replacing them.  Is a rebuild kit available for
&gt; these?
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks in advance
&gt;
