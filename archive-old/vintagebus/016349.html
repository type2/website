Subject: [VB] rods knocking?
Date: Thu, 18 May 2000 01:16:46 GMT
Mime-Version: 1.0

Along with my lack of oil pressure, there's this ticking on the left side of 
the engine.  If I put my ear in the engine compartment, it comes from below, 
and if I put my ear under the engine, it seems to come from up 
above(obviously not below).  I've never heard rods knocking before, but it's 
been doing this for a couple months now.  I hear it real good at idle, but 
seems to fade into the noise of the engine when at higher RPM's.  I held it 
at higher RPM's for a bit, then slowly let off the throttle and didn't hear 
any noises until the engine noise quieted down enough to hear the loud 
ticking.  Thanks for helping and Happy driving--Chet
