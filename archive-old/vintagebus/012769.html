Hi all
I have put as much as i can remember about the campout on a webpage
http://www.globalserve_dot_net/~jrivers/greensboro.htm
Myself and my Kids had a great time! The people at the party are what
makes the fun! The buses added the ambiance!
If you were at the campout and think i should add something, please
let me know!
Back to cleaning up my bus from the trip!
Later
Jamie
