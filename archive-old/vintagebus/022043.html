Anyone interested in early Wesfalias, I just scanned in a few brochures and a 
parts book for early Westys (Campbox, SO-23, Campmobile and Accessories 
(SO-42)).

If you're interested in taking a look, some of them are really cool!

I'll be adding a few SO-34 pages shortly, but take a look and see at this 
site:

Hope you like these pics,
