Domonic writ:
&gt;stock 1600 dp. I was wondering what dizzy and carb &gt; combination do you
think that i should use? &lt;
Andrew writ:
&gt;If you want to use your 009 and don't want to re-jet/redneck a 34, your
best betis probably a 30 PICT-x carb with adapter. &lt;

Now I writ:

I would also advise the vacuum advance dizzy for a bus.  I have has horrible
luck with the 34PICT-3 though and do not recommend it.  The 34 just seems to
sensitive to keep in tune and you must have the stock parts to use with it
or it gets feisty.

Last night I ripped my non-idling, non-accelerating, non-tuning 34 out!!!  I
then setup my spare 30PICT-3 for the bus and we will see how it does later,
hopefully tonight.  I run a DP 1600 with polished heads and a mild CB cam
(comparable to an Engle 100) and I think the manifold vacuum was not correct
for a decent idle with the 34.  Should have tried the rivet :)

As a side note that damn adaptor is a POS!!!  Luckily I have a grinding
wheel otherwise I would never get that thing to fit properly.  If they gave
that adaptor just a quarter of an inch more lift it would be fine, but
nooooo.  Instead you have to grind down that far to the pump lever to move
correctly.   Also the casting is so bad you could potentially cut your
fingers off on the casting edges, again the grinder cleaned this up nicely.
BTW the adapter PN is 3101 made in Mexico,  RMMW has the same PN and I am
sure everyone else sells the same junk part.

I have has good previous luck with the 30PICT-3 so I hope it works on my
bus....  Otherwise I will have to yank the motor once again and put the
Weber 34ICTs back on, which ran great!  Silly me I wanted something that was
easier for everyday use... HA, jokes on me!
