Subject: Re: [VB] DC rear seats

my Feb 29 1960 DC is the same as David's.  No pipes or tubes.

&gt; The 59 dc (may 19) has a pedestal with the dip in it...  It is nothing more

&gt; Everett asked:
&gt;
&gt; How many styles of Double Cab rear seats are there?
&gt;
&gt; I thought 3:
&gt; 1. Binz
&gt; 2. 59-65 - seat stand has a dip in it
&gt; 3. 66-67 - flat seat stand
&gt;
&gt; But someone mentioned to me that they thought there was a 59-early 60 style
&gt; with &quot;bent pipes underneath&quot;.  I don't know what that means.  My ex-Feb.
&gt; 1960 Double Cab seat looked like normal rear seat to me.
