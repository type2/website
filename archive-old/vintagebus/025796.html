&gt;         Andrew Kiemm used to have a shop in Orange, CA about 2 years ago
&gt; called &quot;Kustom 1 Autohaus&quot;.  His number is no longer valid and I am trying
&gt; to get ahold of him.  If anyone knows of his whereabouts, please let me
&gt; know...   thanks

Look in ANY VW mag and you'll see an ad for them. Phone number is 714.997.9893
