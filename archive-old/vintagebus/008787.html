Subject: Anyone want a 67 Westy?

OK. Here is the deal. I have been working on my 67 wety for some time now
and it is really coming along. My only problem is, as much as I like it, it
isn't what I really want. I.E. a single cab, double cab, or 21or23 window
deluxe ragtops. So I figured I would at least try to see if anyone might
have a lead on someone in the SE that might want to work out some kind of
deal. If not, I will lose no sleep finishing this one up. I'll just sell at
a later sate to buy what I want. Finally bought paint for it now, and I know
it isn't original, bit I went with a 2-tone cloud white and candy apple red!
Can't wait until I actually get to spray it! Thanks again!
