What year bus?  If you have a '67, or a bus with a 67 nose cone, or
one of the brazilian nose cones, there will be a two-terminal switch.
One lead goes to hot, the other to the light, doesn't matter which is 
which.

If you don't have this magic switch, you'll need to get one of the
speedo-actuated backup lights (and anyone who has ever seen me in a speedo
backs up real quick!)

&gt; can't seem to find any terminal for it.
