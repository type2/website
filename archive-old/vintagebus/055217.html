&gt;Body number 272409 (Behind front seat, passenger side) is 
&gt;October of '57 production.  Chassis number 272409 (Engine
&gt;compartment) is August of '57 production.

Chassis numbers and dates from Doliwa:

272 301  12 July 1957
281 900  2 September 1957

So it looks like it could have been closer to mid-July. 

&gt;Either way it is a '58 model year so I think it should have 
&gt;the larger round tail lights.

Are you sure?  I think this Bus predates the idea of &quot;model year&quot;
a little bit.  The info I have says that they started counting
&quot;model years&quot; with the '59 model year on 1 November 1958.  I
think this Bus might qualify as a '57.

On the tail lights, Doliwa says 5 April 1957 at chassis 246 964 for
the two brake lights instead of the center one.  Bus Trivia: At the
same date, the angle of incidence for the license plate lamp was
changed to 8 degrees.  Remind me to bring a protractor to the next
show.  :)
