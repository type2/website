Subject: old gasoline in tank
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

Hi.
Just bought a bus. The PO drove it only once a month
for the past 2 years. The tank is about 40% full of
gas which is over a year old.

The bus runs, but won't idle, and it sputters and
backfires in 3rd gear(I know there are a hundred other
potential causes for this, other than bad gas, but
while I'm at it, I was wondering if a year or so is
long enough for the gas to go bad?

The archive says you can add twice the amount of new
gas and should use it promptly.
Do you folks agree? or, is there an additive I can buy
at the FLAPS? I'm sure there's plent yof people who've
been faced with this same deal.


Jason
