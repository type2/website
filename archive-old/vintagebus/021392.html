Yeah, I picked up a nice '53 25hp last fall.  It cleaned up nicely, but I
still have a few bugs to work out.  The plug wires being one of them.   The
other problem is the distributor that came on the engine (Bosch VJUR 4 BR 8)
has the vacuum unit on it and the carb doesn't have a place for the vacuum to
go to.   Any ideas?
