  Since my registration, tire guage, and other junk that 
accumulates on the tray under my dash seems to roll 
around and collect behind the pod where I can't reach 
it, and goes swimming when it rains, I'm considering 
making a vacuum formed, ABS organizer tray that fits 
there, keeping stuff tidy and dry (I'm the Operations 
Manager for a plastics company). 
 Another idea of mine are caps that fit snugly over the 
fresh air vents to seal out drafts and water. 
 If your interested in either, or have any other ideas 
for formed, fabricated or machined plastic parts let me 
know. I am going to try to get started on drawings and 
molds in my spare time this weekend.
