Let's hear a leak report on the left coast safaris. My og's on the DC with og style seals leaked like a beer bong. How are the UK seals holding up? I painted parafin into the gap last season, but it was a mess to clean off last spring. Wax seeped out all summer, all over the nose.  

More storms and flooding coming to CA this weekend. If we'd learn a lesson from the easterners and freeze our precipitation, it wouldn't flood our patios and parking structures. It'd stay in place until we were ready to shovel it elsewhere. Note to CA listees... focus on the heart rending damage,  don't mention amenities like pools. You shiver under candlepower, don't mention sitting in the hot tub with tiki torches. 

BTW, the power crisis in CA is scripted by greedy corporations. They've shut down power plants for &quot;maintenance&quot; and other bogus excuses to cause shortages.  A municipal-owned system (socialism!) in Redding, CA is making $$$ selling their extra power to the PG&amp;E grid. Years ago PG&amp;E bought up most municipal systems, shades of the gas/car/tire coalition buying up trolly systems to put 'em out of business. www.turn_dot_org has the best info. 

Here's an alternative, air cooled transportation system. Karl found this...
