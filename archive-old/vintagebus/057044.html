Subject: Re: [VB] '59 Westfalia in Hot VW's

And the other nice thing?  5, 10 even 20 years from now, someone can
look at that mag for hints on how to restore those, and they won't

&gt; I really like seeing nice stock  restorations in the mags.  I actually bought 
&gt; the April 02 Hot VWs cause it had Matthew Henricks' 21 window in it.   Sweet 
&gt; bus. Looking forward to seeing your 59 Westy.
