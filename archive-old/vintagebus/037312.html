 being new to thisnumbers thing, is this the sort of readings other 
&gt; people 
&gt;  are getting?
&gt;   &gt;&gt;
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt;   I have a 66 with a single port 1600 and doghouse oil cooler. Mine runs 
&gt; between 200 and 210 on a level grade, on the highway, with both kids and
the 
&gt; wife riding with me.. Add any kind of a grade to the scenario and the temp

&gt; slowly begins to creep higher.I really so down once it tops 230
&gt; 
I run a 1600 single port with a doghouse as well. In a 63 with a &quot;freeway
flyer&quot; or so it claims.
Just ran it today on the freeway about 75 plus degrees out. I went 65 for
about 40 miles or so. Oil temp was sitting at about 200 degrees on a 10
percent incline the whole way. Love my bus, always runs cool. If yours dont,
look at your doghouse and make sure all tin is there. My bus has always ran
cool, and no its not the sender or guage, they have been calibrated and
examined.
Jason
