 I remember back in my youth, we used to change out the
engine or tranny right there in the junk yard by the donor.

Worse case was drag it out front in the parking lot and put
it in . .

Somebody was always working on some car in the neighbor-hood
if we had any neighbors . .

Mourn with me ladies . .  we'll not see those times again . :-)

You go to a town I lived in once, if they catch you working on a car
anywhere in that town . . they will tow you off and fine you .

There are a couple garages in town in hidden locations and you
can get your car carried there . . no tire of your POS may touch
their pavement . . :-)

Even in that town you can operate if you follow the rules of good
grooming . . unless you are under that hood, the car never looks
like it's being worked on . .

Then there's the good manners part . . I'm living in a place that
had a lease that was a killer in that reguard . .

You go lay it on the manager  . . there is nobody in this town can
work on it  . . I'm too poor . . whatever . . be sincere . .
practice being sincere . . :-) have a deadline for this chore ..

&quot;Ill have it done before dark . . or if not done, I'll have it all
cleaned up by dark . .&quot; getting thru the first day is all .. after
they see how you work, it's not a problem . . meet your deadlines
or get back to them with the new sob story . . :-)

You have to look clean when you're working in public . . don't drink
beer or cuss too loud when you hit that finger . .
You up against some real hard-cases, you wear a lab coat and tie . .

Think like a real estate agent . . if you go back in the house, put
that engine lid back over the hole where you have the engine out . .

Nothing looks more pathetic than a car with the engine out parked in
front of anybodies house . . or even the hood up . . it lowers the
real estate value . . it really does . .!

Think cammoflauge . . prop a wheel back under that fender . .

You have a nice wax job on the Toad, you pick up about fifty points .

I've overhauled engines in motels this way . .

Here's my best trick:

You live in this exclusive neighbor-hood that does not do junk cars . .
you have a beautiful rust-bucket you paid for and you want to drag home . .

Buy a car cover . . put the new car cover on and use some Armor-all on
the tires . . to the real estate agent or your neighbor this is already
your custom van or car under it's car cover . .

This is also making a statement, even if they know what's under the
cover . . keep those tires up . . a low or flat tire is BAD . .

You go so far as to buy an &quot;Expensive&quot; car cover, and put new tires
on the two wheels facing the street and you can even increase
property values . .

We equate that cover to what's underneath . . there's an expensive
car under a cover like that . . probably one of those &quot;collectibles&quot;.

The cheapest car cover makes your car better than any car that don't
have a cover . .

A tarp is not in the same league . . doesn't impress the real estate
man . . . still it has it's place . . even there  . . on yuor own
property . . dress the tarp down properly and neatly  . .  it makes
a statement . .

While I know people  who think it's real clever to tie their tarp down
with milk-jugs full of water . . I'd just as soon they moved on . :-)

A ragged tarp or cover is out . . but then you have the picture
by now . . :-)

One other item . . you have a leaker . . I remember a landlord who
went out and inspected my car before he would rent to me . .
. . . no leakers in his car-ports . . .

Many of us have leakers . . many others don't  . .
 get an oil drip-pan even if it is your drive-way . . if I was your
father, I'd make you move . .  :-) now keep the pan clean . . say once
a week wipe-down . .

Then there's the guy with the junk-yard many cars etc. . . . piles of
stuff . .

Make it the neatest junk-yard they ever saw . . I could take that to
the city council, if need be . .

If you put &quot;neat&quot; and &quot;junk&quot; together, you have &quot;neat junk&quot;,
totally different animal . . :-) at least, you have a business . .

Wear a tie and look serious . . . :-)

Who knows .. you mow the lawn and cover some of those piles up and
your neighbor may stop hating you . . dogs will stop growling . .
and those little old ladies . . how they always seem to hit you with
their shopping carts in the grocery?

They really do have it in for you bro . . . :-)
