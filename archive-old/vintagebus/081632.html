Subject: Re: [VB] Speeding, Cooling, and Over-reving

I too have given up on watching oil temps. I do believe in keeping them
below 220, and above 180, but other than that, oil temps are not my focus.

Almost five years ago I started messing with CHT gauges in conjunction to
oil temp gauges to see what affected what. My main focus was checking out
synthetic oils, but I also tried with and without oil external oil coolers
to see what the differences were. This was done on my 2276cc daily driven
bug, but the info is fairly universal for the aircooled VW engines.

What I found, no matter what oil I ran, or if I ran my external oil cooler
to keep my oil temps at 180, or without the oil cooler which ran oil temps
up to 220, the head temps never changed one bit. That engine ran 350 on the
highway, 300-325 around town, and up to 380 when pushing 90mph down the
highway. I did find that synthetic oils dropped my oil temps around 10 to 15
degrees, that was nice. During these tests, I did nothing but change things
with the oil system.

Last summer, I removed the oil cooler completley from my 64 bus (1600DP).
Stock oil cooler and external were not present. Again, head temps did not
change one bit from when oil cooling was present. The interesting thing was,
my oil temps only got above 220 degrees when I would push my bus over 55mph.
Driving around town and driving the highway at 55 or slower, would keep the
oil temps in line.

After all is said and done, I firmly believe that VW added the oil cooler to
the engine (we've all seen the photo of the early prototype motor with no
provision for an oil cooler) to cool the oil from getting too hot, but was
not added to aid in cooling the motor because frankly, cooling the oil
cannot lower your head temperatures. In everything i've done in the last 5
years of checking head temps vs. oil temps, I have never had oil affect
heads.

On a side note, which may explain where the oil gets a notable amount of
it's heat from, is the cam and lifters. I've heard that Berg's cam break in
machine will heat the oil that the cam is submerged in to about 140 degrees.
This is just spinning the cam with lifters riding against them with spring
pressure. This also makes more sense to me in that oil temps seem to rise
with higher rpms (more cam/lifter friction), or when you run higher valve
spring pressures. Just something to digest there.

&gt; I agree. I've decided to get CHT's instead of oil temp gauges for all
&gt; our vehicles.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Hi Volks-  if my oil temp gauge agrees with my dip stick- I'm in
&gt; &gt; &gt; heaven......Ted
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I've overheated a bus with my oil temps not getting above 200. Head temp
and
&gt; &gt; oil temp are not related, just a word of caution.  ;-)
