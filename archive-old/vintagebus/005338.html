&gt;  When was the last time someone at a swap GAVE
&gt;you something for nothing?

 Hmmm last time I swapped I had a parts pile labeled &quot;free, take only what
you need&quot;...parts that weren't worth taking show to show or weren't worth
much ( to me anyways, non vintage)...well up comes a guy with a suitcase and
claims he is &quot;helping&quot; kids restore bugs....he then proceeds to load up his
suitcase with all the parts( misc. knobs, taillights, after market chrome
misc., etc) I felt good knowing that I had helped someone and maybe put a
few vw's back on the road without making someone drop piles of cash.....
the next show I see his lame a*s swapping the parts he got from
me!......some ppl just don't get it.

&gt;&gt;   It pays to
&gt;&gt; cultivate good Karma!
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;
&gt;Ain't that the truth.  At Kelly park, I struck up a good conversation
&gt;with a seller.  He ended up giving me a straight rim.  Of course it was a
&gt;lowly 14, but it was free!  When was the last time someone at a swap GAVE
&gt;you something for nothing?  I must have been over due for a withdrawal at
&gt;the Bank of Karma   Either that or he just wanted to clean out his garage
&gt;cuz he was moving...like he said.  Either way, we both went home happy
