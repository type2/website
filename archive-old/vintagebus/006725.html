I doubt if it is WW being they make there own that Thom is fully aware of
there fit! Pretty inconsistent. I have seen 2 other people making them, even
door panels, ! 1 of them is using a thin wood backing with a textured vinyl
to match the original gray panels, really nice stuff, I hope to have a set
of these here soon for evaluation, fit and finish, and will pass on this
persons name after I have seen the finished product.

There was a guy named Mark making really nice ones, I think he was
selling them thru one of the mail-order houses, ie WolfsburgWest
