Subject: Re: [VB] AGAIN an aluminum case update

Stan-
You obviously have me confused with someone 
who ....would spend two thousand dollars and
commit much time and effort in resolving new
defects a second time.
I'm just a shopper. I haven't purchased a new
case yet I don't know the statistical odds of
receiving a good one :)
Craig K  vwbus_at_ckoon_dot_org  does. ( Less than slim:)

&gt; I would be very interested in aircooled_dot_net's list of known defects of
&gt; the new aluminum type 1 cases. There seems to be considerable confusion
&gt; regarding this, and the frequency in which they appear.

&gt; I consider myself pretty tenacious but I think I'd just have tried to get
&gt; my money back.
&gt; After you've done all of the Research and Development for the case
&gt; manufacturer you're still stuck with a May-Pop Engine because you might
&gt; still have missed something.
&gt; You may have saved them many thousands of dollars with your efforts to
&gt; use their product but you'll never get a thank you or a check and
&gt; absolutely not a case that is properly cleaned and machined.
&gt; I just could never have any faith in any part that gave this much grief.
&gt; I must admit you photography is very good and the problems are clerarly
&gt; defined.
