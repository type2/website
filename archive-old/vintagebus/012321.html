Subject: re;beetlemex, bocar
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

a customer of mine just took delivery of a 1998
maxican beetle. i have driven it, it came with fuel injection like a super beetle and electronic ignition, it has a brain to control everything
and all the sensors needed, it does not have a thermostat probaly because the sensors adjust
the fuel mixture to compansate for temperture
changes, so the engine you bought is a fuel injection motor with a carb they put on it.
  to my understanding they assemble the turn key
engines themselves with new vw parts, the long blocks that i sell come from the mexico factory
as replacement vw motors and are built for carbs
but they to do not have the thermostat hole in the
case and the cases come from brazil and the rest
of the parts are mexico, there is a differance in import long blocks, yes mine come in crates from
vw of mexico authentico
   the bocar with all the ports if it is a 34 pict
3 is the only carb available in that size boroso
is only making 30 qn 31 pict carbs at this time
just be happy you got a carb at all being that they are in short supply and the prices are on the rise, i have installed over 20 of these carbs without a problem on new and rebuilt engines  , even my 1776 single port big valve has one of the bocars on it and i get 22 mpg in my westy with that
hope this info helps
