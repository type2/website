A comment on the vintagebus list mentioned using Velcro to hang curtains
but it tires after a while...
&quot;Velcro&quot; is virtually a generic term for what most people assume is hook
and loop material.  For years a product made in Belgium called FIXVELOUR
existed which is a hook and &quot;button&quot; arrangement- allows about 8 times the
shear strength of Velcro hook and loop.  FixVelour has one distributor in
the US and it's sold at large fabric shops.  However, VELCRO has now come
out with button vs loop material, and since I use it in the musical
instrument support I make, I had to buy 50 YARDS of it (would last me 20
yrs!).   This is 1&quot; wide in the button sided strip, 1.5&quot; on the fuzzy side.
 It's glue or sew on.  As with friends on the oboe list, I'll sell it to a
few people AT COST if you send a Stamped self-addressed legal envelope with
55cent stamp on it and a dollar inside-gets you a yard of the stuff.   A
quarter and a 33cent stamp gets you 9 inches.  You can hang heavy curtains
with an inch of this and not have them fall off!  I use it to hold down
swing down shelves I put in my 78 BUS.   HOME DEPOT sells stickon sheets
made by Velcro that have also a smaller button side and holds much better
than hook and loop- you cut these to size.   I stick this to the bottom of
cups and to my countertop in the Westy to hold the cups.
