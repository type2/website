Subject: Re: Fitting my bus in my garage

I recently had the same problem as you.  I own a Westy and bought a =
Sportsmobile a couple of weeks ago.  Guess what??  Sportsmobile  is =
taller than Westy and couldnt get into the garage.  Went through the =
lowering air pressure stuff for a week, but got to be a pain having to =
air up the tires each time I went for a ride in the &quot;new&quot; bus.

When I had some time to look at the situation, I was only about an inch =
too tall.  The garage had 2 pieces of trim that were about 1 1/2&quot;.  I =
cut those off the width of the door and guess what???   IT FITS!!!!  =
Used 3 long screws so I can resecure it and it doesnt look too bad (trim =
needed painting anyway).  See if it works for you.
