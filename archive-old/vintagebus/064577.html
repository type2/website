&lt;&lt;  So do you think I should just unplug the wire out of the master cylinder
 and run a new one to the brake lights, with a jumper wire?
 Thanks again,
 Paul &gt;&gt;

this is what I did, with the exception that I disconnected the wire that ran 
back up from the MC where it pluggs into the TS assembly, which is near the 
fuse box.   This was I didn't have to crawl unde rthe bus and get dirty.   
You can check you have the right wire because if you turn the ig on and step 
on the brakes the brakes light won't light up, but the test lamp you hooked 
to the wire from the MC will light up.   I hooked that into the 14-4  (cable 
of 4 14 guage wires) that I had previously installed for guages, but two were 
still free.  The otehr end came out in the engine compartment, so I hooked a 
wire to both brake light segments of the euro bulb holders.  Hazards should 
still work for yours, in the TS segment.  
Bus I did this to is a 61 a PO had cut for 62-71 taillights, so it has no 
hazards.
