Subject: Re: [VB] a sad day for the bus

I saw a nicely restored Gordini version of the Renault Dauphine parked
along the street in downtown Christchurch, New Zealand 6 years ago.
This Dauphine looked like it could blow the doors off of my '56 oval
which I was driving when I saw the Dauphine.  Wish I'd met the
Dauphine's owner so that we could have drag raced!  A good race in CHCH
with the Oval was always again Morris Minors.  The 1200 engine in the
Oval aways seems to have amazing reserve power during a street race with
a Minor or even a Jowett Javelin!
