&lt;&lt;  if your oil is constantly being circulated throughout the engine what

designed to stop only chunks of metal from internal components breaking down.

Hi Bob,
We were given a 40HP engine from a friend we had gotten into VWs, and this 
had been his first engine.  He wanted a 1600 instead, and so we got his first 
engine with only about 10,000 miles on it.  We drove it for a couple thousand 
miles and took it apart to fix a out of balance piston that had replaced one 
piston that had been damaged by a valve problem.  Unfortunitly this was done 
by a shop across the country where they had not tried to balance the new 
piston to the rest.  Thusly it was so badly out of balance every 500 miles 
one had to retorque all of the engine tin sheet metal screws to keep from 
loosing them.
  So we took the engine down to a short block balanced the pistons to within 
a gnats arse wieght.  While we were down to this piont we decided to balance 
the rods also.  Having taken the rods off we found that the rod bearings all 
had small grooves in them from bits, and pieces of metal in the oil being 
pumped through.  So we replaced the rod bearings with new ones, and 
reassembled the engine with a vintage EMPI oil filter/pump.  It was very 
interesting when changing the oil the next three times, and not being able to 
find more than a tiny speck or two of metal dust on the inside of the sump 
plate!  Instead of the normal coating of metalic dust and larger pieces of 
metal pieces up to the size of a pin head.
  About 10,000 miles later the crankshaft broke which turned out to be due to 
no raduises having been ground into between the bearing journals, and crank 
webs.  Took the engine apart to find the rod bearings had not a single trace 
of metal being pumped through them.  No gouges, no grooves.  Instead the 
inner surfaces of the rod bearings had a very fine polish to them!  
  When VW came out with the type 4 engine it had a full filteration system 
stock.  Which is one of several reasons why the type 4 engines last easily 
over 200,000+ miles without rebuilding in the much heavier 1972-79 bus.  Even 
as far back as the early 1960s one could buy a VW official accessory partial 
filter system for 40HP and later engines.     Eric&amp;Barb
