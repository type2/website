A few days ago, I asked about what kind of adhesive to use when installing
plastic sheets on my doors for a moisture barrier.  I got several responses,
but the most common one was spray-on adhesive.  

I was hesitant to use this since I tend to be a messy worker and figured I'd
end up with the stuff on my arms, hair, windows, other bus, cat, neighbor,
etc.  But after trying a few alternatives with little or no success I broke
down and tried the spray adhesive.  It worked like a charm!  

I taped some newspaper to my door glass to keep the sticky goo off of them
and moved my other bus out of harms way.  The cat must be used to my messy
work because he saw me with a spray can in my hand and ran for his life.
Fellow list-member Bill K. instilled me with visions of the cat firmly glued
to 1 arm, hissing and spitting, and my other arm stuck to the inside of my
door :-)!!

Anyway, thanks to all who responded (and those that just put up with my
misc. ramblings).  I'd definitely recommend the spray-on adhesive for this
job.  Even for those &quot;tidily-challenged&quot; workers out there.  BTW, I got the
plastic at Home Depot for about $5.00 for a 10ft X 25ft roll of 6mil thick
clear plastic.  It will be more than enough to do the sc, the Westy, and the
914.  Watch out kitty, here I come again....
