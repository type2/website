Subject: [VB] NOS washer pumps

There was some discussion earlier regarding the possibility of obtaining an NOS windshield washer pump.  I stated I knew of a place called &quot;Orange Performance&quot; that sold me one some months back, but nobody posted the number...no surprise, it was the wrong name!

Kustom1 Warehouse 714-997-9893

At that time it cost me $75 for one.  The company itself doesn't have them, an employee of theirs had a stash...the order guy knew who I was talking about and got him on the phone.  I have no idea if any are left.

Part # 211 955 977

Hope this helps.  I have no idea where I got that other name from...they are located in Orange, CA, though.

Andrew W.
