Subject: RE: [VB] Replacing Steering box on my '60 DD

That is correct - there is an alignment line on the arm and the spline!

regards

RobK


I think I know what you are asking Jamie. Your saying you would like
the pitman arm to align exactly on the splines as it did on the old
steering box? right? I cannot be sure, but I'm almost positive there
was something on the shaft and arm that helped me align them......
