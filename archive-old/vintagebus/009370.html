Hi,

My bus has a Kamper Kits in it. Well  what is left. I (like
a dufus) about 20 years ago removed the ice box and the
small seat next to it and put those parts into a dumpster.
The rest of the kit is still there. All the paneling, the
fold down seat etc. Oh, I dumped the large fold up table
with the nice white with gold sparkle formica. Still have
the small fold ups on the doors. The best part of the Kamper
Kits is that I can put a 4 x 8 sheet of plywood through the
back hatch. KK made a narrower side closet and a larger seat
than any of the other camper installers.

By the way, my Dad purchased my DD camper new from Wes Behel
VW in Sunnyvale, and I was with my Dad when he drove it off
the lot. Went on many camping trips in that bus. I have
personally driven over 200K miles in it. The bus has about
307K on it now.

Any other questions, let me know.  Ah, and it was in Monte
Vista, CA. I don't think that city (town)exists anymore.
Neither does the town of Simla that was located at Homestead
Rd and Stevens Creek (the creek, not the road).

I recently called the distributer for Hehr and there are no
more louvered windows left. I found most of a new one at a
very old RV supply store down here is So Cal. Bought it for
$10 because the frame and glass were good.

&gt; On a whim I took out my roof panels in the camper today.
They were really
&gt; starting to show their age, sagging in places and so
forth.  So I'm
&gt; stacking things gently in the backyard when I notice
things written on the
&gt; 1&quot; X 1&quot; X 48&quot; support pieces (of wood).  It's hard to
describe how the 2nd
&gt; owner set this up...it's a rather lame job (weak dark
wood, etc).  Anyway,
&gt; when I set two pieces together and can make out in
handwriting:
&gt;
&gt; Kamper Kits
&gt; Monta Vista, CA   &lt;-- it's near Cupertino, CA
&gt;
&gt; And another piece has the address for HEHR MfG. Company
(they're the guys
&gt; who make all the windows in our campers).
&gt;
&gt; So maybe...just maybe, I don't have a Riviera at all.  Or
I do and the 2nd
&gt; owner got a new interior from Kamper Kits!  Sadly, I've
found ZERO info on
&gt; Kamper Kits at type2_dot_com
&gt;
&gt; Ahhhh, the mystery grows deeper each day!
