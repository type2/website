Subject: roof rack straightening?

If we were to have a roof rack that had some buckled legs, is it possible to 
straighten these?  People have over riders straightened right?  seems like it 
should be possible to have the bars of a rack straightened as well.

What kind of place would we go to for this type of work?  Can anyone 
recommend a place in so cal?

Thanks
