have you considered getting a &quot;limited recycler license&quot;???
 also high fences are very accomodating, these laws are &quot;complaint&quot; type
laws unless someone complains it is rarely enforced, what they can't see
they can't complain about (or rarely will)

&gt; New York State law forbids the possession
&gt; of one (1) or more motor vehicles which are
&gt; unlicensed, unregistered, or uninsured or
&gt; any combination thereof.
&gt; These are considered &quot;junk&quot; regardless of the fact
&gt; that they have a value in excess of scrap metal.
&gt; The same law forbids possession of parts or
&gt; materials stored in open areas of premises.
&gt; Some communities have taken this a step further,
&gt; to include legal vehicles ( properly lisenced, registered
&gt; and insured ) temporarily disabled at a residence.
&gt; This would include a vehicle on jack stands for the
&gt; purpose of changing a tire.
&gt; 
&gt; Exceptions include vehicles displayed at licensed
&gt; repair shops for the purpose of repair or liscensed
&gt; dealer or wholesaler lots for the purpose of sale.
&gt; Lisenced junk yards are also exempt.
&gt; Also exempted are those vehicles stored in a building.
&gt; Car covers and tarps do not satisfy this exemption.
&gt; 
&gt; There are no legal collectors of vehicles
&gt; who do not satisfy these regulations.
&gt; 
&gt; According to New York State Executive Law
&gt; section 382(2) you can be fined up to $1000
&gt; per violation per day and imprisoned up to
&gt; 1 year or both.
&gt; 
&gt; I am currently considering my options
&gt; regarding &quot;alledged&quot; violations of this law,
&gt; both to satisfy the authorities and to allow for
&gt; the continuation of my activities.
&gt; 
&gt; Any advice will be appreciated.
