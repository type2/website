&gt;...... Speaking of slats, if anyone is replacing original ones with nice new
&gt; replacements and you'd like to get rid of your old ones, my DC needs a
&gt; set.  I'm looking for complete or partial sets of original bed slats for
&gt; a double cab.  While I won't be searching for original bed slat screws,
&gt; I would like the look of original weathered slats to match the truck.

It doesn't take long for new untreated oak slats to become weathered.  I
left my new white oak bows exposed to the elements so they would weather,
and they looked about 5 years old in a couple of months sun/rain/snow
exposure.

FWIW,
