The Oregon story... from the DMV's own e-mail response.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Hello,

Thank you for your inquiry. Oregon does not have a Classic category for
vehicles.

We have two types of registration for &quot;old&quot; vehicles:

Special Interest Vehicles:

1. An American or foreign-made motor vehicle that is maintained as a
collector's item and is at least 25 years old as dated from any current
year; OR

2. The vehicle is sanctioned as a motor vehicle of special interest by an
established organization that provides for recognition of motor vehicles of
special interest.

3. A street rod as defined by ORS 801.513.

Antique Vehicle:

ORS 801.125 states that an antique vehicle is a motor vehicle that is older
than one-half the number of years between the current year and 1900 and is
maintained as a collector's item.

A vehicle may qualify for either special interest or antique registration.
In this case, the customer may choose between the two.

When a vehicle qualifies for only one type, it may be because the year model
restricts the vehicle to one type or because the customer may want to
provide their own plates. For example, in 2002, a vehicle can qualify for
special interest registration if the vehicle is a 1977 year model or older,
or the vehicle may be sanctioned by an established organization if it is
less than 25 years old. For a vehicle to qualify for antique registration in
the year of 2002, the vehicle must be a 1951 year model or older {which is
one-half the number of years between the current year (2002) and 1900}.

Customers may provide their own plate for special interest registration, but
may not provide the plate for antique registration.

These vehicles must be maintained as a collector's item and may only be used
for exhibitions, parades, club activities and similar uses, but not used
primarily for transportation of persons or property. (ORS 805.030)

The main difference is in the cost of the registration and the types of
plates. When you have determined which way you want to registered I can
explain the fees or you could call 503-945-5000 and speak to an operator.

If you require further assistance, please contact me.

Jim, Customer Assistance

Drive happy, or sit happy while being restored (my current situation).  The
engine is about to come out of the shop.  Rebuilt and ready for the road
when I get all the bolt on parts back together.  Wish me luck.
