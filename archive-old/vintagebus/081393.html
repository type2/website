If you look at the literature for the Duelers, you will find that
Bridgestone claims that the tread design reduces noise. Also there is only a
2 ply sidewall that keeps the ride smooth.

&gt; I'm running them on my 79 Westy, and they are not loud at all. Down the
&gt; highway, the wind makes more noise than the tires. Not bothersome at all.
&gt; Traction on wet pavement was improved tremendously, as well as snow. I
give
&gt; them an overwhelming two thumbs up.
