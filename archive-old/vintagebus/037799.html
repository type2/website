I was wondering - if you remove the rear shocks from a Bus, can that knock the rear wheels out of alignment over time and therefore cause uneven wear on the tires?  

Or... Is the purpose of shocks to provide more than a dampening effect but to also keep the suspension at a consistent position while driving?
