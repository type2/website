&gt; I used Gunk Foamy engine bright,  followed by simple green, lots of
&gt; scrubbing. Hot H20 from hot water heater drain helped. Very nasty. Much
&gt; better, no OE paint lost, expect for what was rusted on apron already.

&gt; wondering what cleaners folks have had good luck with cleaning the gunk
&gt; out of the engine compartment. I was able to get most of it with simple
&gt; green and hot water but some of it is just to tough to scrub off. I'm a
&gt; little paranoid of the oven cleaners as I'm trying to preserve whats
&gt; left of the original paint. ronnie
