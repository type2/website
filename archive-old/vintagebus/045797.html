&lt;&lt; I Need some information on this ad. by Wolfgang for a rear lowering kit. 
 It say it eliminates reduction boxes. Will that Make a difference on the 
 FREEWAY? &gt;&gt;
Hi Mike,
Definitely will make a differance, but results in having to lower the front 
also.  Which adds to the cost to do that correctly/safely.  Plus the tranny 
you use has to be geared correctly for the straight axles, and speeds you are 
aiming for.  Just the wrong gear or R&amp;P , and you can end up with too low of 
gears, or gaps between the gears.
  If you like stock hieght the freeway flier might be the way you will want 
to go.
