Subject: removing inner  front wheel bearing

Wow

in the restoration process of my microbus 1960, i dropped the axle beam on
floor, and removed all  brake part (then the surprise, all wheel cylinder
are stuck in rust), now to remove the inner wheel bearing its a hard think
it barely move, i dont have a puller with me, is there any trick to remove
this, in order to get my backplate to be blasted/por-15 ??

Also, i was looking around for brake wheel cylinder part, i wonder why its
less expensive to buy in Europe from Custom speed part
(http://www.customspeedparts_dot_com/) than any other store in US/Canada ??
Its 25 Euro vs 39$ US each cylinder and the shipping is almost the same from
US or from Europe (to Canada).

Did you know you could buy a new axle beam for about 500 $ shipped there ?
