I saw one myself in my recent travels.  I just have to find out if it is for sale.  I have always wanted one.  Actually, I want the one for a bus with belly pans.  This one was on a 61 turquoise standard walkthrough if I remember right.  Como green interior and bullet lights... pretty cool.  Actually, it might have been the other turquoise one that was the walk through.

Fixed ambulance bus side step.
Has a little peddle that you push and it &quot;retracts&quot; out from under the 
I know where one is right now, attached to a Bus, but I don't feel like
driving 20 hours to see if it's for sale.  :)
