Subject: Re: [VB] Gas gage issue

You are experiencing a &quot;floating ground&quot;. Attached a dedicated ground wire
to the body of the gas gage, it should stop.

Subject: [VB] Gas gage issue


&gt; Hi all;
&gt; When I turn on the lights in my 6v bus, the gas needle goes all the way to
&gt; full no matter how much gas is actually in the tank. When the lights are
off,
&gt; or on but with the dimmer all the way towards low light, the gage works
great.
&gt; Interestingly enough, the same thing is happening in  both of my buses, so
I
&gt; figured there was a big chance that someone else had experienced this and
knew
&gt; what is happening.
&gt; Both of my buses are 6v originally, but one of them has been transformed
to
&gt; 12v. Both of their gages are 6v. I did try a 12v gage on the converted
bus,
&gt; and the symptoms are still the same! This is not the way it should work,
&gt; right?
&gt; Thanks for any help solving this puzzle,
