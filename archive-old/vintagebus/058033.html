i don't believe that &quot;SK&quot; means sikkens paint. i 
think it is a german abbreviation for special color combination, for 2 main 
reasons. first, every bus i have seen that has &quot;SK&quot; has been painted from the 
factory uniquely in some way that is different from the &quot;normal&quot; way they 
painted a bus. example: my 61 flipseat (and jp's) everything, including the 
interior, was the lower body color, and only the OUTSIDE above the beltline was 
white. this is in contrast to say a standard that would be say blue/white, where 
the interior would be white.

second: can you imagine the factory having to 
change the paint in the spray booths every single time an &quot;SK&quot; bus came 
through?

i have an original flipseat paint color brochure 
which specifies the &quot;SK&quot; combinations/number designations for those 
particular busses. SK 1023 is specified as (body color)turquoise/(roof color) 
blue white.

 

 

 Another thing. I looked at Everetts site for the colors 
and at the pics of


the bus again and it appears that the color code SK 1023 is white upper 
with

a sky blue? lower. This was determined by the inside of the engine lid 
and

doors. Has anyone ever seen this combination before and are Sikkens 
pait

colors all special order?
