Subject: RE: [VB] anyone got contacts

Believe it or not, Robert Davis's Westy came from my town (LaGrande).... I
tried to buy the bus several times and never could find the owner... then
one day, it was gone.  I was bummed.... and then later I found out that Robs
westy and the 'missing' westy that I had drooled over for so long were the
same thing.  I'm just glad it went to good hands.
