Here is the message that has them the most ticked off: (5/21/00)

I agree with ya!  The Sacramento Bug-O-Rama is an expensive show as well,
for the podunk gig that it is, costing $25 to get one person and their car
in.  Show &amp; Swap extra, but I don't have the prices handy.

Actually, in his spare time, he plays with AMERICAN STREET RODS, NOT VW's!
That's right - the VW's are just the gravy, to fund cutting up and
customizing early American cars.

&gt;72, picture of Bob Hole in middle right. I know what he does in his spare
&gt;time. LAUGHS ALL THE WAY TO THE BANK!!!! with all our  $$$$$. Do any of you

Here is another one I'm sure didn't make them happy, either (but hey, at
least I was getting the word out about the how on the 'net, which they seem
to be unable to do):

***	
Sacramento Bug-O-Rama Next Sunday May 28th _at_ Sacramento Raceway!  
Swap, Show, Drag Racing (dressing up in women's clothes and driving real
fast has never appealed to me)
All proceeds go to benefit the Bob Hole Fund for Disadvantaged Cal Look
Kiddies and New Beetle Wannabes!
I'll be there with both buses!
