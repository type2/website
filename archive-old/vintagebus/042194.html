&gt; I agree!  This needs to be voiced loud and clear. VWOA/AG needs to hear

Well, as a matter of fact my wife is interested in a new car and she
really likes the Passat wagon.  Of course, she also likes a Subaru
Forester and with VW's attitude about the aircooled folks in general and
URLs in particular we are very likely to end up with the Japanese Boxer.
If Volkswagen was so concerned with trademark they should do what many 
corporations have done and change their name to a coined word that has no
meaning other than the name of their company.
