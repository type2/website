VOC = Volatile Organic Compound.  400 grams/liter = how much VOC is in the
paint.  VOC does nasty things to you and the atmosphere which is why they
tell you how much there is.  If you go look at a body shop that was visited
by OSHA you should see either really low Voc materials in use or an
elaborate filtration system and space suit looking things for the painters
to wear.  Trouble is, the old high VOC materials were pretty easy to use and
produced a really good end result with less work than some of the material
in use now.  I'm not a body man, but being in the Coast Guard I've painted
many a ship and watched the material we use change over the last 18 years.
