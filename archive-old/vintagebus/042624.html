Subject: apology to I. and all.
Message-ID: &lt;Pine.BSF.4.10.9910191551440.45589-100000_at_users.anet-stl_dot_com&gt;

all,

i have done some soul searching since earlier this morning and would like
to apologize to all for wasting your time with this situation. I
especially would like to apologize to issaiah.

to clarify:

This wasnt a situation where i confided in him and he went and got it. it
was a situation where the seller misunderstood his previous agreement with
me in agreeing to sell to our young friend from wisconsin.

The best reaction to this would have been to not bother I., he was
acting on good faith in what the seller said.  My proper course of action
would have been to take the issue up with the seller and not involve
hundreds of unrelated people.

again, i apologize for dragging everyone collectively through the mud, and
to I. specifically.

after all, we are still all healthy and there are busses in the world to
play with.

humbly,

Stephen White

p.s. please do not reply to this publically without asking administrative
permission first, i asked a special dispensation to be allowed to post on
a killed thread...
