Subject: 36 hp Engine Number

Got a bus with a 36hp engine in it. Engine number is: A030268X. Can anyone
tell me what year bug it is for ? Is for sale as I don't need it. Complete
engine with muffler, missing pea shotters. Previous owner said engine ran
good when he last drove bus in 1986.  Still all 6 volt.  Don't want to try
getting it running so will sell as a non running engine. Would like to get
$100.00 for it. Engine is in Lake Havasu, will hold for pickup at BBBIX in
Jan. with full payment. Will list on Samba next week.
