I was subscribed to the wrong list for a long time, so forgive me if somehow
you already read this request.

I am working on a '63 Sundial and I think I want to lower it, but I don't
want to give up my spindles as a core. Does anybody know where I can get a
set of stock '63 spindles cheap, or know where I can buy a set of well built
lowered ones?
