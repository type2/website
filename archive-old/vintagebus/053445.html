Would a CD full of donated bus photos help fund the List? I've got a bunch =
of pictures I'd donate if it would benefit the hobby.  Feasible?=20

I don't know that they are available on the web... did Ronnie host them? =

But I burned the whole thing onto a CD for myself and sent another copy =
off=20
to the Listee, called NQ (?), who took all the pictures as a thank you =
and=20
personal record for his use.

&gt; &gt; Last year we had some wonderful coverage from a
&gt; &gt; Listee who tooks tons of
&gt; &gt; photo's and posted them update style when he could.
&gt; &gt; Is someone doing this
&gt; &gt; again for those of us who can't go and need to live
&gt; &gt; vicariously through
&gt; &gt; others?
&gt;
&gt;are these pictures still available?
