Subject: Re: [VB] Friday thought, hmmmmmmmm!

&gt;Hello All,
&gt;Another understanding wife story.  As most of you realize, not all spouses
&gt;understand our VW affliction.  My wife has always tolerated my obsessions
&gt;with a sigh and that &quot;well I knew you were this way when I married you 20
&gt;years ago&quot; look.  It is usually me with the wisecrack so this struck me as
&gt;funny.
&gt;  A couple of weeks ago I had the poptop off the Westy getting ready to have
&gt;it refinished.  I told my wife, &quot;I'll have the top back on by this weekend&quot;.
&gt;  She just looked at me and said, &quot;Why not just leave it off?&quot;
&gt;I looked back at her with a buslier than thou smirk and asked.  &quot;Why would I
&gt;leave the top off a poptop bus?  She calmly replied, &quot;It would make it a lot
&gt;easier to pour you money into it&quot;, and walked away.


This is an example of a couple of Garage Logic (a local radio show)
articles of faith:

1)  FFLF

Female Fun Limitation Factor.  Women have little ways of making sure men
don't have 'too much' unfettered fun.

2)  The Look

This is what you get when you've screwed up yet again, or you're in some
kind of trouble (in the doghouse).

For more Garage Logic, go to:

The show is listenable online from 2-5 PM Central time

Here is some more of the Garage Logic lexicon, from the Institute for
Cylinder Appreciation:

B as in B, S as in S -
A Garage Logician's comment on just about anything that's not Garage Logical.

C.I. (Cylinder Index) -
The total number of internal combustion cylinders in your possession.
(vehicles, gas powered equipment, marine and aviation all qualify)
If it is less than your age, move on to Euphoria.

C.P. (Chief Procurer) -
Wife, individual who is in charge of supplies at home.

End of the World -
A preface for describing an incredibly moronic event or situation.

FFLF (Female Fun Limitation Factor) -
When a woman asks &quot;Do you really think you should be doing that?&quot;

Fighting Stogies -
Team name for the University of Garage Logic

Foghorn -
The sound one hears immediately after uttering an incredibly moronic
statement and/or a word not in the Garage Logic lexicon.

G.U.S. -
Give Up Space! All good Garage Logicians ensure that their driveway is
fully shoveled during the winter time. DON'T EVER GIVE UP SPACE!

Linking -
GL technique.

The Look -
The expression one gets from one's spouse when one does something
incredibly moronic. Women are born with a natural ability to give &quot;the
look,&quot; but men can
acquire ability over time.

MRLF (Male Romance Limitation Factor) -
When a man seems to always ruin the most romantic of moments. Definitely
not showing their SCUM colors at the time.

Moron Chip -
A miss-firing of brain synapses that results in unbelievable stupidity.

S.C.U.M - Sensitive Caring Urban Male -
Describing a male Garage Logician, especially hizzoner, the mayor.

Two-Cycle -
The G.L. town dog. A likable and fair mutt that won't sit or roll over, but
will fetch a 3/8-drive ratchet for you.

WD-40 -
Official cologne of GL.

Uh, We don't know that! -
A response given to those who don't have their facts straight.

U.S.S. Common Sense-
GL's official boatcraft that sails over the waters of Euphoria in search of
citizens with common sense.
