To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com



&lt;&lt; and running thinner 
 oil such as straight 20w or 5w-30.  Do not use 10w-30, 30w or 40w  this time 
 of year &gt;&gt;
is this the general consensus of the list? I often wonder lately what of the 
modern oils is the most appropriate. I dont expect every one to agree, just 
want to get a general feeling.
