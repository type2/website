Subject: Nose Sheet Metal Success?

Hi,

I found that the WW lower sheet that fits behind the bumper
is almost an exact replica of the VW part including the
little angle that the upper sheet is supposed to fold over,
however, the part is not bent in the correct curve. In fact
it is dead straight. Any suggestions on a good way to bend
it down to fit the curve of the nose?

The Schofield lower part wasn't right but Schofields repair
part for the last rusty 4 inches of the upper nose sheet
fits right onto the WW part except that S's part only has a
right angle at the bottom, not a fold over as would be
correct. Well beggars can't be choosers so I will use the
parts.  Now I need to find a way to seal the seam when I
spot weld the 2 parts together. Any suggestions?

My 2 cents.

Chris
