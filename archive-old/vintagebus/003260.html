Subject: Quality shift coupler?

Do any of you know where I can get a good shift coupler? The one I bought at the FLAPS is crappy and just refuses to hold one of the bolts in tightly (after very few miles). Any suggestions as to where to buy a good one (like maybe one with &quot;VW&quot; stamped on it)? Or should I hit up the junkyard for a used one? I've heard the ones with red neoprene are ok, but noisy? Forged vs cast? 

Thanks,
-Wilder
