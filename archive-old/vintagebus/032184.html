&gt;Like I said, it's a matter of where you want to spend the effort; if
&gt;I have a bus with rusty rockers, wiring all kapoiey, and super beelte

&gt;be the LAST thing I did.

Thom, Having fixed many speakers I can say its not nearly as much 
trouble to do then repairing rusty rockers. It takes not very much time to do
and is downright fun and rarely frustrating. So, since the stock speakers
often do sound
better than the radioshack crap it is worth the effort to me.
