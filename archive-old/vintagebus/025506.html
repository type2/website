Subject: Help, I need paint
Message-ID: &lt;375F7514.43594D79_at_dolphinsci_dot_com&gt;

At the end of 1998 I bought a quart of L345 and a pint of L337
L345 is the stock light gray for my double cab and
L337 is a '58 - '59 Karmann Ghia color (Dolphin Blue - a blue gray
metallic)

It turns out that as of 1/1/99 I can no longer get those colors in
acrylic enamel here in southern california.  Also there is no cross
reference to the urethane that I am &quot;allowed&quot; to use now.

I got an email back from PPG giving me enamel #s but no cross or formula
to urethane.

The local supplier carries PPG and Dupont and for the urethane, they
recommend using the Dupont Chroma system.

Can anybody come up with cross reference, mixing formula, supplier
recomendations, etc. that would help me in getting a load of this paint?

My original data is below:
Volkswagen #   PPG Acrylic Enamel #   Description
L345                31960             Pale Gray
L337                31883             Dolphin Blue   (blue grey
metallic)


Any recommendations?

Thanks

Scott
