Hello all:

    Hey i sent out a message earlier and haven't seen it so I'll try
again. My problem is that my brake luid reservior is leaking right above
the screw in part that goes into the master cyl. Well I cleaned it off
and it is empty, so then i put RTV all around it. Any reason this won't
work? I know it's a cheap part, but I live in the sticks and nobody
around here sells the reservoir for a 60. I plan on ordering a new one,
but wondered if this might work until then. Thanks for the help. See Ya
