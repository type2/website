Subject: [VB] &quot;Free&quot; panel update and weird stuff
Message-Id: &lt;3.0.6.32.19991221234356.00bca900_at_pop_dot_calweb_dot_com&gt;

Been busy with the new panel!  

Brakes: all new brakes all the way 'round - these suckers are getting
expensive!   The bus stops on a dime - and all the tools and junk I have in
the back go slamming into the wall.

Engine: took the running beater motor, got bored, installed new pistons and
cylinders.  This motor ran great, but was getting tired.  I'm gambling $100
(the price of the P/C set) that this will get me thru the winter.  I'm
having a hell of a time with the motor in other respects: it doesn't always
want to turn over fast enough to start - just kinda grinds and moans.  I
did check the starter bushing, at least glance-wise, and it looked OK.  It
also wants to stall after cruising a while and coming to a stop
sign/stoplight.

Another wierd one: when I shut the motor off, I hear a weird gurgly-hissing
noise from the left side of the engine, kind like when you're turning over
a tight motor and the compression vents off slowly.

I even have a heater!

Body: started on the rockers - parts are on the way from Ronnie.  Luckily I
had a RHD short-rocker piece on hand as an extra from the '54.  Tonight I
sectioned in the lower 7&quot; on one of the bashed cargo doors - came out
pretty sweet for 3 hours of labor.  The second one will go faster.  Nose
piece is soon to be on the way from Mr Howard in AZ.  I'll probably bust
that job out during the week between xmas and new years, which HP has off.

The Other Tom has his panel running and driving with the 40hp that came
with his single cab.  He cut the nose out of the single (not a lick of rust
on it!) in the junkyard to use on his panel, paid $20 for the whole damn
thing - lucky dawg - and it's in, done and primered.
