on the way home from work, I was cruising down a street that is having one
of those &quot;anything goes&quot; track pickups - you toss anything out there and
the county will haul it away for you.  I spotted a wide whitewall bias ply
tire and stopped to check it out.  I got a barely-if-ever used wide
whitewall 5.6x16&quot; bias ply tire!  It's in very good shape, no scuffing or
checking.  Probably sat in someone's garage.

This is basically a barndoor or split-window bug tire!
