&gt; I have a friend at work that has a 1970 Camper and is looking for a new
&gt; 1600cc dual port motor.   He is really looking for a NEW not REBUILT engine.
&gt;   He purchased the bus about 3 months ago with a rebuildt engine and the
&gt; whole thing is falling apart!  The heads are separating from the block and
&gt; the block itself is coming apart.  Needless to say, he is willing to spend
&gt; the money and get a NEW engine.  To me it seems that he is looking for a new
&gt; from VW mexican motor.   Is something like this available?  Anyone have
&gt; suggestions on where to get a good solid reliable motor?
