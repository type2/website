On Wednesday, 3/31/99 Ellis acquired a set of barely used Continetal
195/65/H/15 tires at the local &quot;Discount Tire&quot; store front.

Started the tire hunt by researching in the VW faq sources. Years of
discussions regarding 14&quot; tires. Cripes! doesnt anyone buy 15's?, I
wondered!!! We love the Y370's on Paula's 67 but not available in 15&quot; and
budget isnt there for the Rat'63 thumper that I drive. No LT's or D rangers
immediately available in 15 without getting into the big a**ed Pickem up
truck sizes. Finally decided on either the 195 or 205/75 config and grabbed
the phone in search of good used tires. Started calling the tire locations
with a limited budget. First call to the place near the Rusty Ranch resulted
in an almost new, but used, set of German Continental 195/65/H/15. I
remembered that as a &quot;Volkswagen size&quot;. Next thing I knew I was at the spot
ready to upgrade. I was told that they had less than a thousand miles on
them. They looked totally fresh. $172.00 out the door with road hazard
warranty was a puss deal! Sales schmoe said that they were originally $80.00
each tire. Sa-weet. H rating was supposed to compensate for the sidewall
thing. Actually it is a 130mph speed rating.

Initially I was amped about finally being able to get 15&quot; wheels on the 63
EZ Camper. Have been running UFO 205/75/14s that hold air forever for the
usual reason$. No complaints with the 14&quot; UFO's but wanted to mount the
freshly powdercoated 15&quot; crows feet and get the right sized wheel on the 63.
&lt;Yeah I know Clara, crowfoot whls might not be totally correct for my VIN,
but it was originally a commercial vehicle prior to the dealer camper hack.&gt;

Following the &quot;Mr. VanBondo, your car is ready&quot; thing- I waltzed out to the
bay to find myself surprisingly bummed! Doh! they look so tiny!!!
Renegotiations ensued with time slipping away. My mind's eye wanted a taller
tire. Internal mental vision was that Daytona spokes, hydraulics, boom box,
velvet tuck and roll with automatic weapons should follow... &lt;NOT!&gt; The tire
options all appeared to be either a lesser quality tire or were new babies
priced out of the budget du jour. It was decided by all parties for me to
run the 195/65's to the Boeing swing shift and back and continue the fray on
Thursday. Wind storm was hitting Phoenix all day. Ride was harder and more
squirrely than the UFO 14's ever were. Now I am pretty sure that I will go
for the cheapie new 30,000 mile Goodyear's in the 205/75/15 for just a few
bux more. Still less than $200 out the door. Counting on the wider foot
print and slight height change to &lt;hopefully&gt; compensate for the skitishness
of the 65/195. If I were wanting to slam the bus to the ground or put the
meats on a TypeI then I'd keep the Contis...
