&gt;&gt;  Do I need to fit it all together without tightening anything first?   &lt;&lt;



Hi Matthew,
That is the best way.  The heat riser tubes of the intake  manifold are the 
most alignment problem part of the installation, and can  require retapping out 
of the 6mm threads there.  Usually the heat  exchangers are no problem even 
when tightened down already.  We would take  the HEs off and take a good look 
at the front end sealing flanges.  A  friend of our's lent her bus and the 
fella backed the low hanging extractor  muffler into a curb, pushing the HEs 
forward and bending up the front sealing  flanges.  We had to take the HEs off and 
straighten the flanges back  out....  Also take a good look at the rear 
sealing areas where the muffler  doughnut seals seat.  If the tubes coming out of 
the HEs is corroded down  it would be a good idea to cut off the rear of these 
tubes and weld on new  tubing that is a snug fit inside the seals.
