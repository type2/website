Subject: Vent wing repair

Hi List-

Thanks to all for the suggestions on reinstalling the glass in my 
vent wing frame.  Being genetically lazy, I located a glass shop that 
installed the glass using slightly thinner rubber (and a lot more 
skill!).  The guy did the job in about 5 minutes, and didn't charge 
me a dime!  (He gets my next cracked non-bus windshield)

BTW, while I was watching him install the glass, I noticed a mid-50's 
Packard that he was trying to install a new windshield in.  Turns out 
the only place to get a new windshield for those cars is from some 
guy in Peru.  And, the one he sent for this car was just about an 
inch too small!  Sort of puts VW restoration in perspective!
