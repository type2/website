Subject: Solution for NQ's Road Trip

Good Friday Topic:

Last week, NQ was kicking around the idea of providing a web cam to
document his trip out to California (never heard where in CA he was
ending up).  Big factor was the cost involved.

Amateur Radio (Ham Radio) operators have access to a wide range of
options that would provide a solution.

One of them uses the radio, radio modems, packet data transfer and a
network that is already established for the transfer of photos.

For those interested, check out:

Should be interesting reading for some.

An offshoot of the above network, is that you can put a GPS unit in the
car along with a the radio unit and you can have a built in tracker,
complete with direction of travel, current speed and distance traveled.
I have one such tracker that with the proper help on NQ's end, could be
set up to provide 24/7 location info as to the NQ parade.

I will be putting one of these trackers in both the DC and Jag and will
always have tabs on my vehicles.

Erin,
Now to make it complete, you could run out, cram for the license test
and get your license before heading out on the trip.  Alternatively you
could recruit a Ham operator as a co-pilot.
