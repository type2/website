Subject: oil cooler mounting question

Does the oil cooler adapter use a gasket?

My books don't seem to mention one but there appears to be one in the
&quot;complete engine gasket set&quot;.  They do mention those o-ring-like things
with the steps
but not an actual gasket that sits between the engine and the oil cooler
adapter.

My engine currently doesn't have on there (no leak) but I'm putting
together a
new engine and was wondering what was right.

Thanks,
...Markus
