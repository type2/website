Ok.  That's a long (large) turning radius.  The radius being referred
to is the radius of the circle you'd make if you turned as tightly as
you could continuously.  The longer that radius, the larger the
circle (which means the less amount of deflection from a straight
line).

How many times around does your steering wheel go in each direction?
