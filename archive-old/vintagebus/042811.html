split nosers,

  Recieved the Hymer (Eriba) catalog 2000 today with a nice cover letter.
Andrea states that there is no Dealers in the states.  They are still
making the Eriba-Touring Puck-Classic ([price 12.495,-DM] kitchen and
split window in the front) and the Puck L-Classic ([price 16.490,-DM]
kitchen and sink in the back, no split window in front)  One of the
catalogs is in English and the other in German.  No showers in the Pucks,
but the others have Duschwanne's.  In the dealer section in Germany, you
can rent from Hymer also!  Looks like the weight for the Puck-Classic is
550kg Empty.

Best,
joe 67' Camper
