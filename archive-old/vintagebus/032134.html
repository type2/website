 It's supposed to warm the whole rear seating/cabin area in general.

 Thom &gt;&gt;
it is normal for micros and deluxes, which were though to use the back area 
for people..  Commercials/kombis had all the heat up front only, no heat log 
under the back seat.   note the vents in the heat log faces forward, to warm 
your feet if you sit on the rear seat.

some bays have a rear heat vent too.
