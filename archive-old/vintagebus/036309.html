Subject: Split apart  Redux boxes.
Message-ID: &lt;7jhq6v$tehn_at_eGroups_dot_com&gt;

Hi, I have searched the archives to see if I could find the answer to my question. But, no answer.  Here goes.  I am having trouble splitting the reduction boxes on my 60 Panel. I don't want to have to pound these guys into submission for fear of doing something I might not be able to fix. Oh yeah, I haven't fully removed them off the Arms yet.  Any suggestion? -thanks.
