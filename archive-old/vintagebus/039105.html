Subject: Throw Out Bearing

Hello all! I have a question regarding the TOB on my 65 Double cab. It has
the stock big nut tranny and I was wondering what type bearing would fit? I
have a clutch set for a 72 beetle and I know the disk and plate would work
but the TOB does not have the round &quot;ears&quot; that fit into the arm on the
tranny. It is the later style with the wire clips. Is there a way to use
this later style TOB with my swing axle?
