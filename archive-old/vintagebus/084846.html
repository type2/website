Subject: Re: Wire Crimpers?

&gt;
&gt; Does anybody know where to get the original style wire crimpers for a
&gt; reasonable price? Wolfgang Int. sells them for $129 but that is quite
&gt; spendy.

Unfortunately the ratchet type crimpers often are.  The theory seems to
be that they will be sold to someone who is doing manufacturing, so the
tool price gets amortized out over thousands of connections.  But you
can do a little better.  Del City ( http://www_dot_delcity_dot_net ) sells a few
different styles of ratchet crimpers: 990160, $35, for insulated
terminals, and 990165, $28, for non-insulated terminals.  I haven't
tried these crimpers, so I don't know how good they are.  Mouser
( http://www.mouser_dot_com ) sells some more upscale crimpers from AMP and
Sargent, but they are pretty close to Wolfgang's price.

&gt; Secondly, I need an electric choke element for a PICT 28, any vendors
&gt; out there who sells them new?  I tried the local guys and scoured the
&gt; net but came up with nothing.

http://www.google_dot_com/search?q=28+pict+choke+element yields

http://www.wolfsburgwest_dot_com/wolfsburg/fuelsystem/carb_parts.htm ,
and http://www.bughaus_dot_com/type247.htm among many others.

Standard disclaimers apply; I don't get money from any of the companies
mentioned above.
