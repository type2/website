Hi all,

Here's an ad from a non-listee for a '65 Bus and some parts.  I don't 
know what, if anything, is still available.  Respond to Tom Armstrong.  
I believe (but I could be wrong) that it is in the Bay Area or in No. Cal. 
 
I know nothing other than what's below.  Good Luck to someone 
out there!

Subject: RE: Transporter


I'm still trying to find an enthusiast who can handle the good
spare transaxle in the back seat, and who would not dumpster the boxes of
parts/cores.  If you got any leads, let me know.  Or if an ad goes into the
newsletter, that's fine too.

I'd like to free up my garage space for my Wagoneer before the rainy season
begins.
Thanks
Tom A
