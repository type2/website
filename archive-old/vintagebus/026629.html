Oh.  Ok sorry.  THat's what I get for reading the list at 5am before I'm
off to work.  The Diesel won't hurt Stella, just drain the tank (dispose
of properly!!) and refill with real gas.  Change your oil and she'll
smoke for a while.  The remaining diesel fuel will clean the carb out as
an added bonus!
