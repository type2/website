&lt;&lt; does anyone know the cost of blasting a panel bus? i am entertaining the 
 idea because i like the idea of having a well preped paint job. also is it 
 reasonably easy to prep after blasting. also tips on the undercarriage, like 
 should i do it? my underside looks great, but i wonder if it will nag in my 
 brain as something i should have done. it is hard to imagine actually 
 sanding every surface in the engine comp. and the underside. i was 
 considering just checking then spraying an undercoating.
 just formulating the plan &gt;&gt;


Around here its $700-800 for plastic. $500 or less for sand/silica (if you 
feel adventurous!)
