&lt;&lt; So, to double check this, do I put the shims on the head side or the 
engine case side?  I'm thinking they'd go on the head side, so that the 
pistons can stay in the same area of the cylinder, or does that matter with 
the new rings?&gt;&gt;

Hi Diana,
Best to install shims between the cylinders and engine case.  If the honing 
was doen properly it should be no problem.  Installing shims between the 
heads and cylinders just doubles the amount of sealed surfaces to go bad due 
to hot gasses and cause you trouble.

&lt;&lt; Of course it'd be easier to put them on the head side too, I always have a 
hard time getting the cylinders over the rings and seated against the case 
properly. &gt;&gt;

OK!
2.   Take the pistons and cylinders apart and balance the pistons and thier 
individual wrist pins to less than a gnat's arse beween them.  Make sure to 
balance the connecting rods to the same amount.  Install the wrist pins into 
the forward side of each piston, but not so far as to not allow the 
connecting rod installation.  Install the wrist pin clips on the rear of all 
of the pistons.  Stagger the piston rings to prevent oil and compression 
loss.  Then with a piston ring compressor (Can be in a pinch made out of a 
piece of banding strap and vise grips!) slide the pistons in making sure the 
arrow on the head of each piston will be pointing toward the FW when in place 
in the cylinders in the engine.

2.  After you have the engine case with the connecting rods hanging out of 
it.  Turn the engine to get the rear connecting rods to stick out the 
farthest.  Install the shims on the engine case end of the cylinders and the 
paper shims finger painted with high temp silicon.  Offer the piston and 
cylinder up to #2 and #4 connecting rods and tap home the wrist pins, install 
each of the last wrist pin clips and slide the cylinders into the engine 
case.  Carefully turn the FW while keeping the rear cylnders from poping back 
out of the engine case.  

3.  Repeat all of #2 instructions except for the last sentence.

4.  Install the under cylinder tin deflectors, push rod tubes, heads, etc. 
etc.......
Take your time and do not rush it!
