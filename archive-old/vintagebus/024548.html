Yes.  The nuts keep loosening up.  It has 10 mm studs, John.  So with
the big studs, I can't just go back to little ones unless I disassemble
the engine.  As much as I love my bus, I'm simply not ready at this time
to tear apart an engine that was sold to me in June as a rebuilt long
block.  

I do have a core to do, but finances dictate I wait for a while. 
Besides, the next engine is for my wife to rebuild, with the theory that
as she gets more involved with the bus, she'll be less inclined to tell
me to get rid of it.

This is the second retorque since the left head was replaced 3 weeks
ago.  Last time I have to admit I did only the lower ones as I didn't
have time to pull the engine before I had to go somewhere.  With the
promise of doing it right as soon as I could.

I chose this weekend because I was pulling the drivers windshield to
derusterize and fix the leaks and rusty spots.  The bus was down anyways
and I hate just watching paint drying.

So, thanks for the further questions, and guidance.  Any other thoughts
with the info I added?

I think he meant that the nuts keep loosening up on him.
 
 I don't see why a Loctite-type solution would hurt anything, although
it
 would have to be a product that could take a good bit of heat.
