&gt;  When we had only a color coating on the first rims we had done the cranny
&gt;between the inner and outer parts of the rims rusted quickly and we even had
&gt;some rust show through on the sharp outer corners of the rims.  We used a
&gt;fine paint brush to apply roofing tar into this area to seal out the water
&gt;and stop any rust in there.

The problem above relates to the &quot; Faraday Cage Effect &quot; ( ?) (go find a physicist :).
Essentially, powder is being repelled by the two surfaces where they meet at an
acute angle and so opposing positive charges resist application.
On another tangent, zinc rich powdercoat primer is excellent for auto paint topcoat.
