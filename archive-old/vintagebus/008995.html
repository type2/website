One thing I did was took a &quot;smallish&quot; size drill bit and drilled into the
emergrncy brake handle at the weld joint of the tube where that steel pin
goes in. Drillled until I just hit the pin. Theory was that the penetrating
oil wasn't getting into the center...... Anyway, lots of oil, more heat,
tender love with big hammer..... and it came out.

Guess I should tap that small hole for a grease fitting??? Might have been a
good shot of luck with that too.....

&gt; I've fretted on removing my brake lever for several months now... tried
&gt; heat, oil, heat, oil, etc. etc.  There is just no easy way to get at it.
&gt; It's the *only* thing that I have not been able to remove from underneath
my
&gt; 59 double cab project.... ugh.
&gt;
&gt; Right now, I'm either going to cut the pin and make another one or mask
&gt; carefully and paint the thing in place.
