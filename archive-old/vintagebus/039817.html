&gt;Hey Kelly,
&gt;
&gt;If this were a perfect world I would have you doing a TV show for PBS kind
&gt;of like Norm Abram's &quot;New Yankee Workshop&quot;. Or that lame-o Steve Thomas'
&gt;&quot;This Old House.&quot; It would be really cool to look in on Saturday afternoon
&gt;and watch as you fabricate and install replacement parts for an old bus
&gt;cargo floor, or that job you recently did replacing the entire nose. Each 
&gt;TV
&gt;season you could do an entire bus project start to finish. I'm sure we'd



Its funny to hear you say that. My friend Jeff and I had that idea about 10 
years ago. It was to be called &quot;This Old Bus&quot;. Several trial runs were made 
without cameras, and then we had another friend ready to shoot when it all 
fell apart for various reasons.

I think its too late for a return of this old bus on pbs, but maybe on the 
web????
The original camera men now make videos and websites, so who knows?
Jason S.
BTW my moniker of philflick should always be translated to Jason S of Oly 
WA.
