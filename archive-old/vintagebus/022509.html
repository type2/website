&gt;Has anyone ever made or seen a splittie carcus made into some sort of
&gt;trailer? Pictures would be cool too!

I know of a really cool trailer made from the back end of a lagwagen single
cab.  They cut the cab off, welded the bottom of the engine compartment,
and made some other mods, and it made a nice little unit.
