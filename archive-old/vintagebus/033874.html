Subject: Plate frame needed Sierra VW Fontana, CA
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com


My Mom bought a new Bus from Sierra VW in Fontana, CA when I was 7.  That was 
the bus that started my love affair with VW's.  I would very much like to 
find a License plate frame from this dealership.  If anyone can help me out I 
would very much appreciate it.

Thanks,
Dan
