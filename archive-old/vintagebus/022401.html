And we're forgetting the main advantage of those LEDs - and the reason

*instantly*, whereas the incandescent bulbs have a short &quot;warmup&quot; required
before they're fully on.  At freeway speeds, this can amount to several
feet of elapsed distance before your brakelights are totally illuminated.
