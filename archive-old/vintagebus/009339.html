The &quot;silver&quot; in most antisieze is actually lead [with perhaps some graphite
tossed in], and lead is an excellent electrical conductor...

&gt;&gt;  The silver antisieze has been approved at my work (GE/Honeywell) on
aircraft, for use on screws with terminals attached to them which need to
conduct ( to ground). The threads kept seizing (junk taiwan castings) and
the engineers determined silver to be conductive so it was added to the
process.  &lt;&lt;
