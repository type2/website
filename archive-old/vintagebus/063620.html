Subject: Re: [VB] Tips on removing petrified window seals?

I use a razor blade (razor knife) to slice the old seal- run it along the 
channel.   You can cut eitehr side of the scraper bit, sometimes just one 
side works.  If they are all hard it it mosre difficult.  I use a small 
pointy thing /screwdriver to scrape any remnents left out of the frame.  Work 
for the seal on top of the door as well, though check there for bits that 
were mashed in to keep the seal from sliding out (as if!) Don't cut yrself.   
Hope this helps.

I use wd-40 liberally on the seal and the frame when installing.

Wondering what your are doing about rerusting/painting.

 In particular, I am in the process of removing the 'window
 frame to body seal' that runs around the outside edge of the
 window frame.  The process I am using involves breaking it
 up in to small pieces using a small screwdriver and a light
 hammer and then picking the pieces out or sliding them to
 the end of the channel an removing them there.  This is
 quite a slow and tedious process.
 
 If anyone has any advice for me that would make this process
 go faster and easier I would sure like to hear it.
 
 Many Thanks,
