Subject: Check your Keys!
To: vintagebus_at_type2_dot_com

I have a friend who told me this happened to him in
his bus the other day:

He was leaving work late and it was dark when he got
in the bus to go home. He only drives his bus
occasionally, so his key ring only has two keys on it.
One for his bus (one key fits all: amazing!) and one
for THE CLUB for his steering wheel.

Anyway, he stared it up thinking nothing of it and
drove home and pulled into his garage. When he shut
off his bus and pulled the keys out he noticed he was
holding the key to THE CLUB!!!

(imagine Chevy Chase double take)

He put the CLUB key back in his ingnition (again
effortlessly) and it turned right on. He had been
driving the bus with it.

He said the key only turned the lock when it was all
the way in, so it wasn't like he could have stared the
bus with a popsicle stick, but YIKES!

And he has a '67, so the profile is different and much
longer than the CLUB key.

Anyway, he's getting that thing rekeyed with a new
lock cylinder pronto. I think he believes his pins are
worn.

Just an FYI to you folks. In case you (or someone
else) might be able to start your car with your
Kwikset house key or something.
