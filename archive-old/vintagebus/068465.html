Subject: LAST CALL-Tshirts-EveryBus, Search&amp;Rescue, TeamSpatula_dot_com

Howdy. I realize the economy is bad and all, but so far, I have       
received exactly ZERO orders for shirts. Yes, I've gotten a few       
e-mails, but nothing in hand, and the order is going in ONE WEEK from 
today, which means that orders should really be mailed no later than  
Tuesday to get here in time. Also, a lesson in economies of scale - if
the total order of shirts is really small, then I will have to sell   
shirts for more to cover the art &amp; screen charges. Those of you who   
pre-pay will still get the same price, but that means that unless I   
get 20 or 30 orders next week, shirts will cost probably $20 on site. 
Sorry, but I'll have to cover my costs...Also sorry about the short   
order period, but EveryBus is 2 weeks earlier, and there have been    
some weather-related delays on the artwork. Anyway, here's the info:  
                                                                      
                                                                      
I'm sure you all have your calendars marked for the                   
rapidly approaching EveryBus festival. (www.everybus_dot_com)             
Those of you who have attended in the past know that the t-shirts have
sold out within a couple hours. Don't be denied your shirt this year- 
pre-order now, and save the hassle of worrying about it once you get  
there.                                                                
This year's design, hand-selected by Chris himself, was done by Greg  
Potts, and can be viewed at                                           
http://www.TeamSpatula_dot_com                                            
on the t-shirts page. Final artwork is now online for all current     
designs, as is all the ordering information.                          
                                                                      
I wanted to go ahead and start taking orders                          
now, as there isn't much time with this year's EveryBus being a couple
weeks earlier than in the past. I am placing the final order in 1     
week, so I need your order in my hand before then.                    
Ordering information is on the t-shirt page of                        
http://www.TeamSpatula_dot_com                                            
If you have any questions, please e-mail me.                          
thanks!
