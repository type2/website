Subject: RE: [VB] 6V to 12V

  I have run 6 volt starters on 12 volt systems for years without ill
effects (this way you won't need to change flywheel or do a lot of grinding
on the trans). You can change out the the solinoid to get some more life out
of it. You should not need the relay anymore as it will turn over twice as
fast. One of the tricks? I do on high compression engines is take a 6 volt
starter and have the armature turned down to accept a 12 volt bendix,
install a 12 volt solinoid and varooom instant high torque starter, have one
of those on my DD since I put it together 6 years ago.

Subject: [VB] 6V to 12V


I am starting this conversion on my 65 next week.

I have all new bulbs, turn signal relay, voltage drops for wipers, gas gauge
and clock.

12V engine, 12V starter and am prepared to beat and grind on my tranny to
get the flywheel to fit.

I also have a hard start relay installed already.  Will I need to do
anything with this?? It worked with the 6V fine.

I never did find a &quot;How To Convert a 6V bus to a 12V&quot; webpage on this  so I
am going to make one. If anyone knows of anything I left out please pass it
on...

Thanks in advance.

Peace Brothers and Sisters and Happy Holidays,
Snoopy
